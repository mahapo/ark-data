Thebook focused on how personal beliefs affect our personal reality. But there issomething more profound to be learned, which is that collective beliefs of aculture or society also affect our personal biology and behavior.Society is beginning to recognize that our current collective beliefs aredetrimental and that our world is in a very precarious position. So, I thoughtit was time to bring out a message about how the new biology and other insightsin the world of science can be applied to our societal beliefs and help usaddress the threatening situations we currently face.In this work, I emphasize biology, beliefs, and behavior. However, to fullyunderstand this message, my friend Steve Bhaerman offers information regardinghow social structure, politics, and economics also tie into our biology.Steve: For the past 22 years, I’ve been doing comedy, disguised as SwamiBeyondananda, the cosmic comic. Comedy is a wonderful way to tell the truth anda way to break through the mind’s defenses to get new information andperspective in under the radar.Prior to the Swami, however, my first professional “incarnation” was inpolitical science and social activism during the 1960s. I helped start analternative high school in Washington, D.C., for students who had grown pasttraditional schooling. These were exciting times when new ideas were emergingand being tested. As I sadly observed, the most important of those tests—whetherwe could actually live the lofty principles we espoused—was being flunked leftand right. For example, I recall meeting one individual who was a world-renownedexpert on communal living. Unfortunately no one could stand to live with him.Realizing how little I knew about how to turn the ideal into the real deal, Iembarked on a 25-year journey into psychology, personal growth, meditation, andspirituality. Over the past seven years, I’ve had the itch to integrate thoseideas in a book I wanted to call Healing the Body Politic. After I met Bruce, Ithought we could work on the project together, and he agreed.Bruce: In the medical world, we sometimes have a patient who is declaredterminal and everyone counts her out. Then something happens, and thisindividual has a fundamental change in personal belief through which sheexpresses a spontaneous remission. One moment, she is terminal and, the next,totally free of disease. This shocks many medical practitioners, but it happensfrequently, and most people are aware that the phenomenon exists.Earth and the biosphere—and that includes us—are an integrated living system.While the system appears to be faltering, the planet itself is capable ofexpressing a spontaneous remission. What is needed to facilitate that remissionis a fundamental change in awareness and beliefs as to who we really are. Weused the spontaneous remission concept in the title of this book because webelieve that science’s new insights will profoundly change civilization’scollective beliefs on the nature of life.We have woven this new science into a hopeful story of humanity’s potentialfuture to help promote planetary healing. Spontaneous Evolution merges currentscientific insights with ancient wisdom to reveal how truly powerful we are andthat we can influence our own evolution.According to conventional Darwinian theory, evolution is a very slow and gradualprocess, requiring millions and millions of years to manifest the evolutionarytransformations of species. New scientific insights reveal that evolutionactually consists of long periods of stasis, interrupted by sudden, dramaticupheavals. The upheavals are punctuations that change the course of evolutionand lead to whole new forms of life.Our civilization is presently in a state of disorganization and disintegration.We are currently in dire need of evolutionary advancement and don’t have timefor a slow, gradual evolution. Interestingly, in light of the crises we face, itappears that civilization is already in the throes of a punctuation.Steve: Perhaps the most burning question now is: Is this punctuation a questionmark? An exclamation point? Or, sadly, a period?People are aware that something is happening. They have been exposed to news ofdiminishing natural resources, climate change, and population explosion. Thedoomsday clock is rapidly approaching the midnight hour, when it’s going to bemore than love that comes tumbling down. Religious people are talking about theend times.At the same time, we are also coming to realize humanity is connected. The mostobvious physical demonstration is the Internet, through which we can send andreceive messages around the world at the speed of light. This instantaneouscommunication ties together the entire global village. Everything is entangled.Everything is related.As evidence of that, we see science climbing the proverbial mountain ofknowledge only to find Buddha sitting on top. In combining Bruce’s scientificknowledge of the body with my knowledge of the body politic, we see thatscience’s modern discoveries and the ancient teachings of great spiritualleaders lead to the same conclusion: This is a world of relationship. Nobodygets off the bus. We’re all in this together.Of course, along with this awesome understanding, we realize that the old waysof seeing, believing, and reasoning will not help us alleviate the currentsituation and step into the new. Our survival is at stake. We need a newparadigm. We need a spontaneous evolution. That is why we have written thisbook."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONA Universal Love StoryThis is a love story. A love story for the entire Universe: you, me, and everyliving organism.Act I opened billions of years ago when a wave of light from the sun collidedwith a particle of matter. That spark of love between Father Sun and MotherEarth gave birth to a child on this blue-green spheroid. That precocious child,called life, has made Earth its playground ever since, multiplying into anendless array of magnificent forms. Some of those forms are with us today, butmany more have become extinct and will never be known.The curtain rose on Act II of this love story some 700 million years ago whencertain single-celled organisms decided they’d had it with the single life.Realizing they couldn’t live alone, they turned to one another and said (inwhatever primal language single cells speak) “Baby, I need your lovin’.” Andthus, the multicellular organism was created.Act III began over a million years ago when multicellular organisms evolved intothe first consciously aware humans to arrive on the scene. With consciousness,life was able to observe itself, reflect, and create its own future. Life couldexperience and appreciate love and joy. Life could even laugh at itself and,eventually, come to write books like the one you hold in your hands.Act IV traces the evolution of human clans who joined forces and carved theglobe into nation states. At the present time, we find ourselves near theclosing moments of this act, wondering if the play ends here, like a Greektragedy that always ends badly. Looking at our chaotic world of humandysfunction and environmental crisis, we seem to be headed for an inevitabletrain wreck. Fortunately for us, the Greeks also had five-act plays; these werecomedies filled with laughter, joy, happiness, and love.Spontaneous Evolution is a story about how we can safely navigate from Act IV toAct V. The good news is that biology and evolution are on our side.Inherent within all living organisms is an innate drive to survive, known byscience as the biological imperative. Contrary to what conventional science andreligion have been telling us, evolution is neither random nor predetermined butrather an intelligent dance between organism and environment. When conditionsare ripe—either through crisis or opportunity—something unpredictable happens tobring the biosphere into a new balance at a higher level of coherence.While we often perceive of examples of spontaneous remission as miraculoushealings that happen by the grace of God, looking a little deeper we seesomething else at work. Quite often these fortunate individuals activelyparticipate in their own healing by consciously or unconsciously making a key,significant change in their beliefs and behaviors.So here is the bad news and the good news. The story of human life on Earth isyet to be determined. If there is to be an Act V, it will depend on whether wehumans are willing to make changes in our individual and collective beliefs andbehaviors and whether we are able to make these changes in time.For millennia, our spiritual teachers have been pointing us in the direction oflove. Now science is confirming that ancient wisdom. We are each and all cellsin the body of an evolving giant super-organism we call humanity. Because humanshave free will, we can choose to either rise to that new level of emergence or,in the manner of dinosaurs, fall by the wayside.The religions that grew out of the cradle of civilization, the Fertile Crescentthat is modern day Iraq—which, ironically, is now in danger of being the graveof civilization—have all had the notion of redemption through some savior. Inthat sense, the coming of the Messiah in Act V will turn the play of life into ahuman comedy.All good comedies need a joke, so here is the punch line: we are the answer toour own prayers.THE RISE OF THE PHOENIXAt the current time, many people find themselves transfixed by disturbingsymptoms that seem to mark civilization’s devolution. However, this myopic focusdistracts us from seeing the Light in the darkness.Whether you call this Light love or knowledge, its flame grows brighter eachday. The Light reveals that civilization is in a birthing process as the old wayof life falls away and a new one emerges.This pattern of evolution resembles the phoenix, a sacred firebird in Egyptianmythology. At the end of its life, the phoenix builds a nest of cinnamon twigsthat it then ignites. Both nest and bird burn fiercely, but from the ashesarises a new, young phoenix that is fated to experience the same life cycle.A modern version of the myth is portrayed in the film The Flight of the Phoenix,which provides an epic example of conflict resolution, mastering challenges, andtransformation. The story begins when an oil exploration team abandons itsoilrig in the Sahara Desert. The crew encounters a hitchhiking stranger whojoins them, and together they fly off in a twin-engine cargo plane. When theplane crashes in the middle of the desert, the crew and passengers are stranded.Meanwhile, a band of cutthroat nomads follows the trail of jettisoned cargo tothe downed plane.Just like in the real world, a power struggle ensues for control of this smallcommunity. Who will prevail: the strongest individual or the one who controlsthe resources? As it turns out, neither. Faced with infighting that threatens todestroy their community and endanger them all, the group is forced to develop aplan The hitchhiking stranger, who claims to be an aircraft designer, presentswhat seems to be an improbable plan to build a viable aircraft from the plane’swreckage. With no other options, the community has no choice but to give thisoutlandish new idea a chance. Galvanized by this new vision, they band togetherto create the impossible. In true Hollywood fashion and not a moment too soon,with the nomads firing their guns at the ramshackle aircraft, the untested planelifts off on its maiden voyage to safety.The story of a structure failing and something else rising is a familiar onethat plays over and over again in the biosphere. Life is in a constant state ofperpetual re-creation.HUMANIFEST DESTINYIf you find it hard to imagine that we can ever get from the crises that we arefacing now to a more loving and functional world, consider the tale of anotherworld in transition. Imagine you are a single cell among millions that comprisea growing caterpillar. The structure around you has been operating like awell-oiled machine, and the larva world has been creeping along predictably.Then one day, the machine begins to shudder and shake. The system begins tofail. Cells begin to commit suicide. There is a sense of darkness and impendingdoom.From within the dying population, a new breed of cells begins to emerge, calledimaginal cells. Clustering in community, they devise a plan to create somethingentirely new from the wreckage. Out of the decay arises a great flying machine—abutterfly—that enables the survivor cells to escape from the ashes andexperience a beautiful world, far beyond imagination. Here is the amazing thing:the caterpillar and the butterfly have the exact same DNA. They are the sameorganism but are receiving and responding to a different organizing signal.That is where we are today. When we read the newspaper and watch the eveningnews, we see the media reporting a caterpillar world. And yet everywhere, humanimaginal cells are awakening to a new possibility. They are clustering,communicating, and tuning into a new, coherent signal of love.Love, we will find, is not some mushy-gushy sentiment but the vibrational gluethat will help build this new flying machine and manifest our destiny ashumanity—what we call “humanifest destiny.”Chances are you are among the evolutionary imaginal cells who are contributingto the birth of this new version of humanity. Although it may not seem evidentnow, the future is in our hands. To secure that future, we must first empowerourselves with the knowledge of who we truly are. With a firm understanding ofhow our programming shapes our lives and the knowledge necessary to change thatprogramming, we can rewrite our destiny.Spontaneous Evolution introduces the notion that a miraculous healing awaitsthis planet once we accept our new responsibility to collectively tend theGarden rather than fight over the turf. When a critical mass of people truly ownthis belief in their hearts and minds and actually begin living from this truth,our world will emerge from the darkness in what will amount to a spontaneousevolution.By the time you finish Spontaneous Evolution, we hope you will have a betterunderstanding of past programming, current knowledge, and future possibilities.Most importantly, you will see how all of us can change our programming, our ownand civilization’s, to create the world we’ve always dreamed is possible.Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D., and Steve Bhaerman"},{"pageContent":"PREAMBLESpontaneous Remission“I have good news. There will, indeed, be peace on Earth . . . I sure hope wehumans are around to enjoy it.”— Swami Beyondananda To paraphrase American revolutionary Tom Paine, these are soul-trying times.Madness and dysfunction seem inescapable. We used to imagine getting away to adesert island or mountain retreat to live in quiet sanity. But now, the wholeconcept of away is meaningless. There is no such place as away. Nationalborders, for example, couldn’t contain the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl,nor can air pollution from China be stopped from blowing across Asia. Toxicmedical debris dumped into the water somewhere washes up and pollutes a beachsomewhere else. The air we breathe and the water we drink are all part of adelicate interrelated ecosystem. Yet, the current system we live by, the human“ego-system” if you will, is simply not equipped to deal with these inconvenientrealities.Albert Einstein stated that a problem couldn’t be solved at the same level itwas created. Never has that assessment been truer than today when all of ourreality checks seem to be bouncing. Clearly, we can no longer solve our problemsby doing exactly what we’ve been doing. More weaponry doesn’t bring peace. Moreprisons don’t reduce crime. More expensive health care doesn’t make ushealthier. Nor does more information make us wiser.In lieu of focusing on the crises, we are encouraged to escape into addictionsand distractions conveniently placed before us to keep us preoccupied andpassive. But reality keeps intervening. Everything in the world seems to berolling toward some inexorable, beyond-our-control crisis. Those of us withchildren and grandchildren are concerned as to what kind of world we will leavebehind for them and their children.In early 2007, the so-called Doomsday Clock—the marker that the Bulletin ofAtomic Scientists has used since the first atomic bomb was dropped in 1945 tomeasure the danger of nuclear holocaust—was moved up to 11:55 P.M., a mere fiveminutes before midnight. This is the closest it’s been to the doomsday hoursince 1953 when the Soviets exploded their first hydrogen bomb.The latest movement of the doomsday marker reflects not only the increasedthreat of nuclear war but also threats to our survival from deterioration of thebiosphere, oceans, and climate—what Lord Martin Rees, president of the RoyalSociety, has called “threats without enemies.”1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1] Actually, there are enemies, but theseenemies are in the form of false, self-perpetuating mindsets and the obsoleteinstitutions based upon them.In the face of disturbing news reports that the impact of global warming iscoming sooner than expected, combined with intransigence by a system thatdoesn’t want to change, it looks more and more like the world needs a miracle.This miracle would be something akin to the spontaneous remission of an advancedterminal condition.After assessing civilization’s plight using insights offered by cutting-edgescientists, we are happy to report that there are, indeed, golden opportunitieshidden in the dark clouds of crisis. Those willing to face the music and dancetogether will be the ones who will help transform the threatening crises we faceinto awesome opportunities.The spontaneous remission we seek appears to be contingent upon a spontaneousre-missioning of civilization through which we change our mission from one basedon survival of the individual to one that encompasses survival of the species.This is our fundamental evolutionary mission, our biological imperative.Achieving this remission necessitates that we individually and collectivelyreexamine many of the fundamental assumptions our civilization accepts as true.Those beliefs we find inadequate or incomplete must be revised so that the newawareness is incorporated into civilization and becomes our new way of life.Once we understand what science is now revealing about who we truly are, thestructures that have kept us from that truth will crumble and a new path willpresent itself.It is our intention that Spontaneous Evolution bridge the gap between what wenow know and what we will need to know in order to manifest a spontaneousremission. Ironically, some of the new insights offered by science are so faroutside of what we’ve accepted as conventional wisdom that science itself ishaving a hard time coming to grips with the implications. In other words, if yoususpect that reality isn’t what it used to be, you’re in good company.So strap yourself in, keep your eyes open, and hold on tight because we areabout to experience the adventure of a lifetime. When we realize our role asawakened and aware cells in the body of humanity, when we all participate in andfully experience what may be the most profound and pivotal moment in the historyof the planet, then we will witness a new order spontaneously emerge out ofchaos. How do we know? The science tells us so.Oh, really?If this new reality is truly upon us, why do things seem to be getting morechaotic and disconnected? The answer is that these crises are simply symptoms,which is Nature’s way of informing us that our civilization has pushed thebiosphere to its limits and must now consider a new way of life in order tosustain our existence.We know things cannot continue in the same way, and we are frustrated becausethere appears to be no pathway to lead us anywhere else. Interestingly, the wayout isn’t a linear path. If anything, it is likely represented by a higher levelof consciousness that must be attained by a critical mass of the population.Maybe, when the real rapture comes, we won’t have to fly into the sky and leaveour clothes behind. Maybe we can stay right here on Earth, fully dressed . . .or not. Rather than being beamed up by Scottie, perhaps all we need to do isbeam Buddha down.Now at this point, if we were you, we’d be saying, “Boy, this spontaneousevolution stuff sure sounds good. But how can we know that this is not merelysome wishful pie-in-the-sky thinking and that it actually represents a realpossibility?” That is exactly the question the rest of Spontaneous Evolutionaddresses. And the place to begin is with evolution itself.IT’S TIME TO EVOLVE EVOLUTIONThe fundamental argument about evolution is, excuse the expression, a bunch ofBS. Belief Systems, that is. We have two opposing belief systems that are liketwo barking dogmas making so much noise the rest of us can’t hear ourselvesthink.On one side, we have scientific materialists who insist we got here by randomchance. Their argument is akin to the belief that an infinite number of monkeyspecking away on an infinite number of typewriters would in infinite time producethe works of Shakespeare.On the other side, we have religious fundamentalists who insist that God createdthe world just like the Bible said He did. Some of these believers have evencalculated that God initiated Creation at precisely 9 A.M. on October 23, 4004B.C.E.While these points of view, respectively, are in all probability wrong, whentaken together they paradoxically point us in the right direction. The latestscience is telling us that, while Creation didn’t happen in seven days, it wasnot the result of random evolution, either. Thanks to the new science of fractalmathematics, we are aware that self-similar intelligent patterns recurthroughout Nature. As we will see, when these universal patterns are used toassess the state of human civilization, they reveal the evolution of our humanspecies is on the path toward a hopeful and positive future.Of course at this point, you might be thinking, “If things are so hopeful, whydo we have such a mess right now?” In our discussion of evolution, we willdescribe the nature of punctuated equilibrium, in which crises drive evolution.Accordingly, there are vastly long periods of stability that are punctuated byradical and unpredictable changes. In the wake of such upheavals, which arefrequently marked by mass extinctions, evolution rapidly provides a profusion ofnew species.Crisis ignites evolution. The challenges and crises we face today are actuallysigns that spontaneous change is imminent. We are about to face our evolution.How will our evolutionary advancement come about? Our path is similar to that ofcells in the metamorphosing butterfly larva. When provided with a new awareness,the cellular population that comprises the deteriorating larva collaborates torestructure their society in order to experience the next highest level of theirevolution.We use the caterpillar-to-butterfly pattern to illuminate our current situation,and yet there is one significant difference. While caterpillars inevitablybecome butterflies, the success of our evolution is not inevitable. Even thoughNature is nudging us toward this exciting possibility, it cannot happen withoutour participation. We are conscious co-creators in the evolution of life. Wehave free will. And we have choices. Consequently our success is based on ourchoices, which are, in turn, totally dependent on our awareness.The good news is that we are already well on our way to the next level of humanevolution. We believe this leap in evolution was inaugurated by an event thatchanged civilization’s perceptions forever. The first pictures of Earth beamedback from space in 1969 offer photographic evidence of what spiritual seers haveproclaimed for centuries: the world is one.A picture may be worth a thousand words, but the value of the picture of Earththat appeared on the January 10, 1969, cover of LIFE magazine was incalculable.Etched into the imagination of the world’s citizens was not only the beauty ofour precious blue-green planet but also its smallness and fragility.Anthropologist Margaret Mead called that image “the most sobering photographever made. Our lovely, lonely planet afloat in a vast black sea of space. Sobeautiful yet so tragically fragile. So dependent on so many people in allcountries.”2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en2]That image of Earth from space inspired American visionary John McConnell tocreate the Earth Flag in 1969. And this greater concern for Earth also stokedthe first environmental legislation in the United States in the 1970s.So what happened? Why does it seem we’ve been moving backward since then?Even though the world’s imaginal cells were activated by their new awareness,the global body of humanity is still a caterpillar that, naturally, feelsthreatened by and is resistant to the upstart imaginal cells. And it is thatparadigm of struggle that continues to shape the world’s energy field.In order to secure our future, we must empower ourselves with the knowledge ofwho we truly are. With an understanding of how our programming shapes our livesand with the knowledge of how we can change that programming, we can rewrite ourdestiny.Spontaneous Evolution is designed to be a primer for that transformation. Wehope it provides information, inspiration, and encouragement for those readersseeking a healthful, peaceful, sustainable world."},{"pageContent":"PART IWHAT IF EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG!“The best way to face the unknown is by not knowing.”— Swami Beyondananda Gaze into the sky on a clear, dark, moonless night, and you will see thousandsof pinholes of light—each one a massive, magnificent star in a Universe toolarge to imagine. Focus on one star and realize that it might no longer existbut may have burned out and collapsed into space rubble eons ago. But becausethe star was light-years away, illumination from its former existence is stillvisible, serving as a navigational guide for mariners.Now, turn your gaze from the heavens to our less-than-heavenly Earth and ask:“Is it possible that we have been charting our course by a burned-outphilosophical star? What if our belief system about life is wrong?”On the surface, that contention seems odd. After all, we now generate, share,and absorb more scientific information than ever through books, CDs, DVDs,radio, television, and the Internet. But information alone is not enough. Rightcontent in a wrong context is really misinformation that will lead us either offcourse or on a dangerous course. Consider the story of the captain of a ship whodemanded that the light he saw on a dark horizon change course. When a voicefrom that other light radioed back, suggesting that the ship change courseinstead, the captain bellowed his authority to hold his course. The voice fromthe distant light replied, “Captain, we are a lighthouse.”So you see, the course we choose depends on our perspective. The simple example emphasizes our point.002 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_002_r1.gif]In image A, you might see either a hag or a young woman (you may have to studythe image for a while to see them both). Image B is binary code of image A.While the image data in B can scientifically define the content of A, thedetermination about which image you see at any given moment does not reside inthe data code but in your interpretation and perception as the observer.The message is simple and insightful: one piece of scientific data can describetwo entirely different perceptions. And when we truly believe in a perception,we see it as the one and only reality and ignore all other possible realities.In fact, as individuals and society, we are navigating by old, scientificallydisproved philosophical perceptions. But, like those burned-out starslight-years away, the news of their deaths hasn’t yet reached us. Like the lighton the lighthouse, beacons are shining forth to guide us in a new direction—ifwe perceive them correctly.Today, human evolution is at a turning point where an old paradigm and achallenging new awareness are uneasily trying to coexist. We are wedded by habitand tradition to an outmoded view of the Universe and yet civilization ispregnant with a new, exciting, and optimistic understanding of life.To understand our predicament, let’s travel back in time 500 years whenastronomer Nicolas Copernicus, looking at the sky from a cathedral turret, madea world-shattering astronomical observation. Contrary to popular belief thatEarth was the center of the Universe, Copernicus realized that Earth rotated onits axis daily as it orbited the sun annually.Church leaders considered Copernicus’ idea blasphemy and clung to old beliefs,even to the point of forcing Galileo, at the point of a sword 90 years later, torenounce his support of Copernican theory and spend the rest of his life inprison. Yet, ironically, those same Church leaders adopted Copernicus’mathematical formulas to reconcile discrepancies in their religious calendar.The point is, as Galileo experienced, it takes time for human consciousness toaccept major changes.A century has elapsed since Einstein mathematically proved that everything inthe Universe is made out of energy and intertwined. Yet a vast majority ofhumanity still lives by the outdated principles of Newtonian physics, which saythe world is a physical mechanism engaged in a series of cause and effectactions and reactions. While those in power used Einstein’s theory of relativityto build atomic weaponry—just as the Church employed Copernicus’ calculations toreconcile their calendar—they ignored the immense implications of bombing even asmall part of the planet we share.Meanwhile, our adherence to misunderstandings and “myth-perceptions” has sodisconnected humanity from Nature that human activity has become “web oflife-threatening.” While headlines bear alarms about suicide bombers in theMiddle East, too many people fail to realize that our entire species has becomea ticking time bomb for the planet. Scientific studies have incontrovertiblyestablished that human gluttony and pollution are causing the greatest massextinction since dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago. If present trendscontinue, half of all species will be extinct within this century.1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en3]While our daily routines will continue without lions roaming the Serengeti (hey,we can always visit them at the zoo, right?) there is no life outside the web oflife. Unspoken, but definitely implied among warnings of animal and plantextinction, is our own imminent human extinction.Modern humanity has taken a great deal of pride in the knowledge we have amassedabout the Universe and life. As the most highly educated and information-ladenpopulation in history, we collectively know a lot. But what do we really knowabout what we know? True, we have lots of data, but, as the crises before usreveal, we are apparently a little short of knowledge.Our problems are not with the data, itself, but arise from our interpretation ofthe data. As the illustration of the hag/young woman demonstrates, the same datacan be used to interpret two completely different images. When it comes tounderstanding the nature of life, the image we assemble from the data can meanthe difference between the life and death of civilization. Fortunately, theradical science discussed in Spontaneous Evolution offers a new interpretationof scientific data, one that casts doubt on our conventional perception of life.René Descartes advised us to doubt everything. And now is the time for us tobegin. Not everything we know is wrong, but everything we think we know is upfor examination, reflection, and reconsideration.In Part I of Spontaneous Evolution, we begin with a biological view of how we’vecome to believe what we believe. In doing so, we firmly establish therelationship between beliefs and biology, and how the interaction of these two,in fact, creates our reality.In Chapter 1, Believing Is Seeing, we turn the cliché “seeing is believing” onits head. Starting with how cells process information, we trace biologicalpathways that convert perceptions into beliefs and what might appear to bereality. We offer irrefutable evidence that the mind is, indeed, the master overmatter, and then we get right down to the cellular level to show how and whythis is how life really works.In Chapter 2, Act Locally . . . Evolve Globally, we explain how subconsciousprogramming unconsciously thwarts our best intentions. When tracing theevolutionary history of the mind, we show how each of us is, at once, blamelessand yet completely responsible for our actions!In Chapter 3, A New Look at the Old Story, we move from biology to philosophyand describe how the story we use to explain reality controls our perceptionsand, inevitably, our behavior. We explain how civilizations evolved overmillennia and how each new paradigm greatly influenced the world our ancestorsand parents saw and created as well as the world we see and create today.Most importantly, by stepping outside our stories, we can see that stories are,well, merely stories, no more real than words on a restaurant menu are edible.However, the meaning we bring to those words ultimately determines our choicesof what we end up eating. By lifting ourselves outside the matrix ofunquestioned beliefs, we allow new stories to emerge that will take us from thetragedy of Act IV to a lighter and brighter Act V.In Chapter 4, Rediscovering America, we relate the principles and practices thatinfluenced the creation of the Declaration of Independence and still apply tothe evolution now at hand. This is not a patriotic paean to glorify America,rather it is an acknowledgment of the revolutionary, visionary truths that “allmen [and women] are created equal . . . endowed by their Creator with certainunalienable Rights . . . Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Thesetruths, which have yet to be fully realized in the United States, were actuallya gift to the whole world, a gift that originated with Native indigenous tribes.Reading Part I should provide some relief because its message explains what iswrong with the world and helps generate a new life-sustaining story. When weunderstand that cultural philosophy and individual perceptions are actuallyacquired beliefs that determine not only our biology but also the world we livein, we gain personal and world-changing insight. We cease to be dazed accidentvictims and claim our right to become personally empowered co-creators andarchitects of a brave and loving new world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1BELIEVING IS SEEING“We don’t need to save the world, just spend it more wisely.”— Swami Beyondananda We all want to fix the world, whether we realize it or not. On a consciouslevel, many of us feel inspired to save the planet for altruistic or ethicalreasons. On an unconscious level, our efforts to serve as Earth stewards aredriven by a deeper, more fundamental behavioral programming known as thebiological imperative—the drive to survive. We inherently sense that if theplanet goes down, so do we. So, armed with good intentions, we survey the worldand wonder, “Where do we begin?”Terrorism, genocide, poverty, global warming, diseases, famine . . . stopalready! Each new crisis adds to a looming mountain of despair, and we can beeasily overwhelmed by the urgency and magnitude of the threats before us. Wethink, “I am just one person—one out of billions. What can I do about thismess?” Combine the enormity of the mission with how small and helpless weimagine we are, and our good intentions soon fly out the window.Consciously or unconsciously, most of us accept our own powerlessness andfrailty in a seemingly out-of-control world. We perceive ourselves as meremortals, just trying to make it through the day. People, on presuminghelplessness, frequently beseech God to solve their problems.The image of a caring God deafened by a never-ending cacophony of pleasemanating from this ailing planet was amusingly portrayed in the movie BruceAlmighty, in which Jim Carrey’s character, Bruce, took over God’s job. Paralyzedby the din of prayers playing endlessly in his mind, Bruce transformed theprayers into Post-It notes only to become buried under a blizzard of stickypaper.While many profess to live their lives by the Bible, the perception ofpowerlessness is so pervasive that even the most faithful seem blind to thefrequent references in the scriptures that extol our powers. For example, theBible offers specific instructions in regard to that looming mountain ofdespair: “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to thismountain, ‘Move from here to there’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossiblefor you.”1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en4] That’s a hard mustard seedto swallow. All we need is faith, and nothing will be impossible for us? Yeah .. . right!But, seriously, with these divine instructions at hand, we ask ourselves, “Isour presumed powerlessness and frailty a true reflection of human abilities?”Advances in biology and physics offer an amazing alternative—one that suggestsour sense of disempowerment is the result of learned limitations. Therefore,when we inquire, “What do we truly know about ourselves?” we are really asking,“What have we learned about ourselves?”ARE WE AS FRAIL AS WE HAVE LEARNED?In terms of our human evolution, civilization’s current “official” truthprovider is materialistic science. And according to the popular medical model,the human body is a biochemical machine controlled by genes; whereas the humanmind is an elusive “epiphenomenon,” that is, a secondary, incidental conditionderived from the mechanical functioning of the brain. That’s a fancy way ofsaying that the physical body is real and the mind is a figment of the brain’simagination.Until recently, conventional medicine dismissed the role of the mind in thefunctioning of the body, except for one pesky exception—the placebo effect,which demonstrates that the mind has the power to heal the body when people holda belief that a particular drug or procedure will effect a cure, even if theremedy is actually a sugar pill with no known pharmaceutical value. Medicalstudents learn that one third of all illnesses heal via the magic of the placeboeffect.2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en5]With further education, these same students will come to dismiss the value ofthe mind in healing because it doesn’t fit into the flow charts of the Newtonianparadigm. Unfortunately, as doctors, they will unwittingly disempower theirpatients by not encouraging the healing power inherent in the mind.We are further disempowered by our tacit acceptance of a major premise ofDarwinian theory: the notion that evolution is driven by an eternal struggle forsurvival. Programmed with this perception, humanity finds itself locked in anongoing battle to stay alive in a dog-eat-dog world. Tennyson poeticallydescribed the reality of this bloody Darwinian nightmare as being a world “redin tooth and claw.”3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en6]Awash in a sea of stress hormones derived from our fear-activated adrenalglands, our internal cellular community is unconsciously driven to continuouslyemploy fight-or-flight behavior in order to survive in a hostile environment. Byday, we fight to make a living, and by night, we take flight from our strugglesvia television, alcohol, drugs, or other forms of mass distraction.But all the while, nagging questions lurk in the back of our minds: “Is therehope or relief? Will our plight be better next week, next year or ever?”Not likely. According to Darwinists, life and evolution are an eternal “strugglefor survival.”As if that were not enough, defending ourselves against the bigger dogs in theworld is only half the battle. Internal enemies also threaten our survival.Germs, viruses, parasites, and, yes, even foods with such sparkly names asTwinkies can easily foul our fragile bodies and sabotage our biology. Parents,teachers, and doctors programmed us with the belief that our cells and organsare frail and vulnerable. Bodies readily breakdown and are susceptible tosickness, disease, and genetic dysfunction. Consequently, we anxiouslyanticipate the probability of disease and vigilantly search our bodies for alump here, a discoloration there, or any other abnormality that signals ourimpending doom.DO ORDINARY HUMANS POSSESS SUPERHUMAN POWERS?In the face of heroic efforts needed to save our own lives, what chance do wehave to save the world? Confronted with current global crises, we understandablyshrink back, overwhelmed with a feeling of insignificance and paralysis—unableto influence the affairs of the world. It is far easier to be entertained byreality TV than to participate in our own reality.But consider the following:Fire walking: For thousands of years, people of many different cultures andreligions from all parts of the world have practiced fire walking. A recentGuinness World Record for longest fire walk was set by 23-year-old CanadianAmanda Dennison in June 2005. Amanda walked 220 feet over coals that measured1,600 to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.4 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en7]Amanda didn’t jump or fly, which means her feet were in direct contact with theglowing coals for the full 30 seconds it took her to complete the walk.Many people attribute the ability to remain burn-free during such a walk toparanormal phenomena. In contrast, physicists suggest that the presumed dangeris an illusion, claiming the embers are not great conductors of heat and thatthe walker’s feet have limited contact with the coals. Yet, very few scoffershave actually removed their shoes and socks and traversed the glowing coals, andnone have matched the feat of Amanda’s feet. Besides, if the coals are really asbenign as the physicists suggest, how do they account for severe burnsexperienced by large numbers of “accidental tourists” on their fire walks?Our friend, author, and psychologist Dr. Lee Pulos has invested considerabletime studying the fire walking phenomenon. One day, he bravely faced the firehimself. With his pants rolled up and his mind clear, Lee walked the gauntlet ofburning embers. Upon reaching the other side, he was delighted and empowered torealize that his feet showed no sign of trauma. He was also totally surprised todiscover upon unrolling his pants, his cuffs detached along a scorch mark thatencircled each leg.Whether or not the mechanisms that allow fire walking are physical ormetaphysical, one outcome is consistent: those who expect the coals to burnthem, get burned, and those who don’t, don’t. The belief of the walker is themost important determinant. Those who successfully complete the fire walkexperience, firsthand, a key principle of quantum physics : the observer, inthis case, the walker, creates the reality.Meanwhile, on the extreme opposite of the climate spectrum, the Bakhtiari tribeof Persia walk barefoot for days in snow and ice over a 15,000-foot mountainpass. In the 1920s, explorers Ernest Schoedsack and Merian Cooper created thefirst feature-length documentary, a brilliant award-winning movie titled Grass:A Nation’s Battle for Life. This historic film captured the annual migration ofthe Bakhtiari, a race of nomads who had no prior contact with the modern world.Twice a year, as they have done for a millennium, more than 50,000 people and aherd of half a million sheep, cows, and goats cross rivers and glacier-coveredmountains to reach green pastures.To get their traveling city over the mountain pass, these hardy, bare-footedpeople dig a roadway through the towering ice and snow that blankets the 14,000foot high peak of Zard-Kuh (Yellow Mountain). Good thing these people didn’tknow they could catch a death of cold by being shoeless in the snow for days!The point is, whether the challenge is cold feet or “coaled feet,” we humans arereally not as frail as we think we are.Heavy Lifting: We are all familiar with weightlifting, in which muscled men andwomen pump iron. Such efforts require intense bodybuilding and, perhaps, somesteroids on the side. In one form of the sport called total weightlifting, maleworld-record holders lift in the range of 700 to 800 pounds and female titlistsaverage around 450 to 500 pounds.While these accomplishments are phenomenal, many other reports exist ofuntrained, unathletic people showing even more amazing feats of strength. Tosave her trapped son, Angela Cavallo lifted a 1964 Chevrolet and held it up forfive minutes while neighbors arrived, reset a jack, and rescued her unconsciousboy.5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en8] Similarly, a construction workerlifted a 3,000-pound helicopter that had crashed into a drainage ditch, trappinghis buddy under water. In this feat captured on video, the man held the aircraftaloft while others pulled his friend from beneath the wreckage.To dismiss these feats as the consequence of an adrenaline rush misses thepoint. Adrenaline or not, how can an untrained average man or woman lift andhold a half ton or more for an extended duration?These stories are remarkable because neither Ms. Cavallo nor the constructionworker could have performed such acts of superhuman strength under normalcircumstances. The idea of lifting a car or helicopter is unimaginable. But withthe life of their child or friend hanging in the balance, these peopleunconsciously suspended their limiting beliefs and focused their intention onthe foremost belief at that moment: I must save this life!Drinking Poison: Every day we bathe our bodies with antibacterial soaps andscrub our homes with potent antibiotic cleansers. Thus, we protect ourselvesfrom ever-present deadly germs in our environment. To remind us how susceptiblewe are to invasive organisms, television ads exhort that we cleanse our worldwith Lysol and rinse our mouths with Listerine . . . or is it the other wayaround? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the mediacontinuously inform us of the impending dangers of the latest flu, HIV, andplagues transported by mosquitoes, birds, and swine.Why do these prognostications worry us? Because we have been programmed tobelieve our body’s defenses are weak, ripe for invasion by foreign substances.If Nature’s threats weren’t bad enough, we must also protect ourselves frombyproducts of human civilization. Manufactured poisons and massive amounts ofexcreted pharmaceuticals are toxifying the environment. Of course poisons,toxins, and germs can kill us—we all know that. But then there are those whodon’t believe in this reality—and live to tell about it.In an article integrating genetics and epidemiology in Science magazine,microbiologist V.J. DiRita wrote: “Modern epidemiology is rooted in the work ofJohn Snow, an English physician whose careful study of cholera victims led himto discover the waterborne nature of this disease. Cholera also played a part inthe foundation of modern bacteriology—40 years after Snow’s seminal discovery,Robert Koch developed the germ theory of disease following his identification ofthe comma-shaped bacterium Vibrio cholerae as the agent that causes cholera.Koch’s theory was not without its detractors, one of whom was so convinced thatV. cholerae was not the cause of cholera that he drank a glass of it to provethat it was harmless. For unexplained reasons he remained symptom-free, butnevertheless incorrect.”6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en9]Here’s a man who, in 1884, so challenged the accepted medical opinion that, toprove his point, he drank a glass of cholera, yet remained symptom-free. Not tobe outdone, the professionals claimed he was the one who was wrong!We love this story because the most telling part is that science dismissed thisman’s daring experiment without bothering to investigate the reason for hisapparent immunity, which was very likely his unshakable belief that he wasright. It was far easier for the scientists to treat him as an irksome exceptionthan to change the rules they created. In science, however, an exception simplyrepresents something that is not yet known or understood. In fact, some of themost important advances in the history of science were directly derived fromstudies on anomalous exceptions.Now take the insight from the cholera story and integrate it with this amazingreport: Rural eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of Virginia and NorthCarolina are home to devout fundamentalists known as the Free PentecostalHoliness Church. In a state of religious ecstasy, congregants demonstrate God’sprotection through their ability to safely handle poisonous rattlesnakes andcopperheads. Even though many of these individuals get bitten, they do not showexpected symptoms of toxic poisoning. The snake routine is only the opening act.Really devout congregants take the notion of Divine protection one giant stepfurther. In testifying that God protects them, they drink toxic doses ofstrychnine without exhibiting harmful effects.7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en10] Now, there’s a tough mystery forscience to stomach!Spontaneous remission: Every day, thousands of patients are told, “All the testsare back and the scans concur . . . I am sorry; there is nothing else we can do.It is time for you to go home and get your affairs in order because the end isnear.” For most patients with terminal diseases, such as cancer, this is howtheir final act plays out. However, there are those with terminal illnesses whoexpress a more unusual and happier option—spontaneous remission. One day theyare terminally ill, the next day they are not. Unable to explain this puzzlingyet recurrent reality, conventional doctors in such cases prefer to concludethat their diagnoses were simply incorrect—in spite of what the tests and scansrevealed.According to Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona, author of Coyote Medicine, spontaneousremission is often accompanied by a “change of story.”8[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en11] Many empower themselves with theintention that they—against all odds—are able to choose a different fate. Otherssimply let go of their old way of life with its inherent stresses, figuring theymay as well relax and enjoy what time they have left. Somewhere in the act offully living out their lives, their unattended diseases vanish. This is theultimate example of the power of the placebo effect, where taking a sugar pillis not even needed!Now here’s an utterly crazy idea. Instead of investing all of our money into thesearch for elusive cancer-prevention genes and what are perceived to be magicbullets that cure without the downside of harmful side effects, wouldn’t it makesense to also dedicate serious energy to research the phenomenon of spontaneousremission and other dramatic, non-invasive medical reversals associated with theplacebo effect? But because pharmaceutical companies haven’t come up with a wayto package or affix a price tag to placebo-mediated healing, they have nomotivation to study this innate healing mechanism.DO WE NEED SURGERY? OR JUST A “FAITH-LIFT?”All who participate in walking across coals, drinking poison, lifting cars, orexpressing spontaneous remissions share one trait—an unshakable belief they willsucceed in their mission.We do not use the word belief lightly. In this book, belief is not a trait thatcan be measured on a scale from 0 to 100 percent. For example, drinkingstrychnine is not a game for the “I think I believe” crowd. Belief resemblespregnancy; you’re either pregnant or you’re not. The hardest part about thebelief game is that you either believe something or you don’t—there is no middleground.Even though many physicists might say they believe lit coals are not really hot,they are not apt to shovel the briquettes out of their Weber grill and practicefire walking on them. While you may hold a belief in God, is it powerful enoughto believe God will protect you if you drink poison? Put another way, how wouldyou like your strychnine—stirred or shaken? We suggest before you answer thatquestion you have zero percent doubt. Even if you have up to a whopping 99.9percent belief in God, you might want to forego the strychnine and settle foriced tea.If you consider the extraordinary examples cited above as exceptions, we agree.However, even if they are exceptions that cannot be explained by conventionalscience, people experience them all of the time. Even if we don’t have thescience to explain what they did, theirs are experiences of conventional humanbeings. As a human being yourself, you could likely do the same things as wellas, or even better, if only you had belief. Sound familiar?And, while these stories are exceptional, remember that the exception of todaycan easily become the accepted science of tomorrow.One final compelling example of the mind’s power over biology can be gleanedfrom the mysterious dysfunction commonly referred to as multiple personalitydisorder, more officiously known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Aperson with DID actually loses his or her own ego identity and takes on theunique personality and behavioral traits of a completely different person.How could this be? Well, it’s like listening to a radio station in your car and,as you travel, the station becomes staticky and fades out as a different stationon the same frequency grows stronger. This can be jarring if, for example, youare cruising with The Beach Boys and, a couple of choppy moments later, you findyourself in the midst of a fire-and-brimstone, Bible-thumpin’ revival. Or, forthat matter, what if you’re enjoying Mozart and the Stones suddenly roll in?Neurologically, multiple personalities resemble radio-controlled biologicalrobots whose “station identification” uncontrollably fades from one ego identityto another. The unique behavior and personality expressed by each ego can be asvastly different as folk music is from acid rock.While almost all attention has been placed on the psychiatric characteristics ofpersons affected with DID, there are also some surprising physiologicalconsequences that accompany ego change.9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en12] Each of the alternate personalitieshas a unique electroencephalogram (EEG) profile, which is a biomarker equivalentto a neurological fingerprint. Simply put, each individual persona comes withits own unique brain programming. Incredible as that may seem, many persons withmultiple personalities change eye color in the short interval it takes totransition from one ego to the next. Some have scars in one personality thatinexplicably disappear as another personality emerges. Many exhibit allergiesand sensitivities in one personality but not in another. How is this possible?DID individuals might help us answer that question because they are the posterchildren for a burgeoning new field of science called psychoneuroimmunology ,which, in people-speak, means the science (—ology) of how the mind (psycho—)controls the brain (—neuro—), which in turn controls the immune system(—immun—).10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en13]The paradigm-shattering implications of this new science are simply this: whilethe immune system is the guardian of our internal environment, the mind controlsthe immune system, which means the mind shapes the character of our health.While DID represents a dysfunction, it undeniably reveals the fact that programsin our mind control our health and well-being as well as our diseases and ourability to overcome those diseases.Now you might be saying, “What? Beliefs control our biology? Mind over matter?Think positive thoughts? Is this more of that New Age fluff?” Certainly not! Aswe launch into a discussion of new-edge science you will see that the fluffstops here.THE WORLD ACCORDING TO NEW-EDGE SCIENCEWhat does science say about this mind over matter stuff? The answer depends uponwhich science you ask.The science of conventional medicine tries to reassure us that none of thephenomena we just described actually exist. That’s because today’s biologytextbooks and mass media describe the body and its component cells as machinesmade of biochemical building blocks.This perception has programmed the general public to accept the belief ingenetic determinism, which is the notion that genes control physical andbehavioral traits. This sad interpretation is that our fate is inextricablylinked to ancestral characteristics determined by genetic blueprints derivedfrom our parents and their parents and their parent’s parents, ad infinitum.This causes people to believe that they are victims of heredity.Fortunately, the Human Genome Project (HGP) has pulled the rug out from underconventional science’s beliefs concerning genetic control. This is ironicbecause it set out to prove the opposite. According to conventional belief, thecomplexity of a human should require vastly more genes than are found in asimple organism. Surprisingly, the HGP discovered that humans have nearly thesame number of genes as lowly animals, a finding that inadvertently reveals afundamental myth-perception underlying genetic determinism.11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en14] Science’s pet dogma has long outlivedits usefulness and needs to be mercifully put to sleep.So, if genes do not control life . . . (pause to formulate a mind-blowingquestion) . . . what does?The answer is: we do!Evolving new-edge science reveals that our power to control our lives originatesfrom our minds and is not preprogrammed in our genes.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en15]This is great news. The power for change is within us! However, to activate theamazing power of mind over genes we must reconsider our fundamental beliefs—ourperceptions and misperceptions—of life.Our first serious misperception occurs when we gaze into the mirror and seeourselves as singular, individual entities. In reality, each of us is acommunity of 50 trillion cells. While this number is easy to say, it is almostunfathomable. The total number of cells in a human body is greater than thetotal number of humans on 7,000 Earths!Nearly every cell in your body has all of the functions present in the entirehuman body, which means that every cell has its own nervous, digestive,respiratory, musculoskeletal, reproductive, and even immune systems. Becausethese cells represent the equivalent of a miniature human, conversely, everyhuman is the equivalent of a colossal cell!As we will come to see, our mind represents a government that coordinates andintegrates the functions of the body’s massive cellular civilization. In thesame manner that decisions by a human government regulate its citizens, our mindshapes the character of our cellular community.Insights into the nature of the mind, how it influences us, and where it lives,offer an opportunity for us to fully realize our true powers. An awareness ofthis knowledge allows us to actively participate in the unfolding of ourindividual lives as well as contribute to the evolution of our collective world.AND NOW . . . THE REAL SECRET OF LIFEBoth conventional science and new-edge science agree that, at its basic level,life derives from molecular movements within a biochemical mechanism. To uncoverthe real secret of life that lies beyond mere mechanics, we are obliged to firstexamine the mechanical nature of our cells. This information is relevant to oursurvival, which is more of a question now than ever before.To make it easier to understand life according to new-edge science, we’vecreated an illustration of a cell with metaphorical parts: a set of gears,driven by a motor, controlled by a switch, and monitored by a gauge. (Forreaders not mechanically inclined, we ask for your patience. There is a payoff.)A switch controls the function by turning the mechanism on and off. The gauge isa feedback device that reports on how the mechanism is functioning. Turn theswitch on, the gears move, and the function can be observed by monitoring thegauge. The mechanics of how cells work can be represented by an assembly of gearsdriven by a motor and regulated by a switch and gauges.003 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_003_r1.gif]The Gears: The gears are the moving parts.In a cell, these moving parts are molecules called proteins. Proteins arephysical building blocks that assemble themselves and interact to generate thecell’s behaviors and functions. Each protein has a unique structure and size; infact, there are over 150,000 different protein parts. While man-made machinescan be quite complex, human mechanical technologies pale in comparison to thesophisticated technology within our cells.Assemblies of protein gears that provide specific biological functions arecollectively called pathways. A respiratory pathway represents an assembly ofprotein gears responsible for breathing. Similarly, a digestive pathway is agroup of protein molecules that interact to digest food. A muscle contractionpathway consists of proteins whose interactions produce the body’s movements.New-Edge Biology Conclusion #1Proteins provide the structure and functionof biological organisms.The Motor: The motor represents the force that puts the protein gears in motion.The motor is necessary because the primary characteristic of life is movement.In fact, if the proteins in your body stop moving, you’re well on the way tobecoming a cadaver. Therefore, life derives from the forces that put proteinmolecules into motion and, thus, generate behavior.The Switch: The switch is the mechanism that tells the motor to put the proteingears into motion.The switch is necessary because life requires precise integration andcoordination of cellular behaviors. Think of the cell’s functions—respiration,digestion, excretion, and so on—as instruments in an orchestra. Without aconductor, orchestras would produce a cacophony. In living organisms, theswitches that reside in the cell’s membrane represent a conductor thatharmoniously controls and regulates the cell’s various functional systems.The Gauge: The gauge represents the body’s method for accurately monitoring thesystem’s physiological functions.Biological gauges are essential to maintain life. Think of the gauges in yourbody as being like the gauges in your automobile. Even though gauges reside onthe dashboard, which is your driving command center, the gauges monitorfunctions in the engine as well as throughout the vehicle. Just as yourautomobile’s gauges report oil and fuel levels, battery amperage, and speed, sothe body also gives you feedback to regulate behavior and sustain your life. Butunlike mechanical gauges with pointing needles or LED readouts, biologicalgauges convey information via sensation.These sensations originate from by-product chemicals that cells create in theprocess of carrying out normal functions. These chemicals are released into theenvironment within our bodies. Specialized cells in the nervous system usemembrane switches, equipped to recognize these chemical markers, to monitor theconcentration of specific by-products. When these nerve cells are activated,they translate the by-product’s signal into sensations that our consciousnessexperiences as feelings, emotions, or symptoms. To fight an infection, forexample, activated immune cells release chemical messengers, such as interleukin1, into the blood. When interleukin 1 molecules are recognized by specificmembrane receptors on blood vessel cells in the brain, these cells forward thesignal molecule prostaglandin E2 into the brain. Prostaglandin E2 activates thefever pathway and simultaneously produces symptoms we sense as elevatedtemperature and shivering.One of the basic problems with our health care system today is that the medicalindustry gauges success by how well it relieves symptoms. Doctors prescribepills to eliminate pain, reduce swelling, or lower fever. However, drugging oursymptoms can be as destructive as putting masking tape over our car’s gauges. Itdoes not solve the problem; it helps us ignore it—until the vehicle breaks down.Likewise, drugging the cells and masking symptoms ignores signals bombarding ourbodies from the external environment.THE FINGER ON THE SWITCHWe have revealed that molecular switches activate protein gears, which, in turn,move and generate behavior. Now the big question concerning the secret of lifeis, “Who or what turns on the switch?” To turn the switch, we introduce . . .the signal. A signal from the cell’s environment puts the gears, motor, switch, and gaugeinto motion.004 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_004_r1.gif]The Signal: Signals represent environmental forces that switch on the motorwithin a cell and cause protein gears to move.Signals represent both physical and energetic information that comprise theworld in which we live. The air we breathe, the food we eat, the people wetouch, even the news we hear—all represent environmental signals that activateprotein movement and generate behavior. Consequently, when we use the termenvironment in our discussion, we mean everything from the edge of our own skinto the edge of the Universe. This is environment in the truly large sense.Each protein responds to a specific environmental signal with the intimacy andaccuracy of a key fitting into its matching lock.The coupling of a protein molecule with a complementary environmental signalcauses the protein molecule to change its shape, which, by its nature, isexpressed as movement. The cell harnesses these molecular movements to drive itslife-providing protein pathways, such as respiration, digestion, and musclecontractions. Protein movement animates the cell, bringing it to life.New-Edge Biology Conclusion #2Environmental signals causeproteins to change shape; the resultingmovements create the functions of life.BRAIN VERSUS GONADSWe must emphasize that even though the vast variety of protein pathways in thecell provides for the functions of life, merely having those pathways does notgenerate life. Life is dependent upon the precise coordination and regulation ofthe cell’s protein pathways. The brain and supporting nervous system representthe regulatory mechanism that coordinate all of these many pathways that providefor life.So . . . where is the cell’s brain? Well, contrary to what you probably know,it’s not in the genes. If you think back to high school or college biology, youprobably remember that the cell’s largest organelle, the nucleus, is describedas the control center, or brain, of the cell. Because genes are housed withinthe nucleus and it was presumed that genes control life, it was a no-brainer toassume that this organelle represented the cell’s brain. However, in light ofthe infamous nature of assumptions, we must question the accuracy of thisbelief.Observations from experiments published 80 years ago challenge the assumptionthat the genes are the brains of the operation. When one removes the brain froma living individual—chicken with its head cut off notwithstanding—thatindividual dies. But if a nucleus is removed from a cell, a process calledenucleation, the cell survives, and many can live for two or more months withouttheir genes!13 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en16] In fact, enucleatedcells will continue to function normally until they need to replace proteinparts vital to their survival.Genes are simply blueprints used to make protein parts. Enucleated cellseventually die, not due to an immediate absence of genes, but because theycannot replace their worn-out protein parts and, as a result, they inevitablybegin to decay. While traditional thinking has taught us to believe that thenucleus is the cell’s brain, in truth, the nucleus is the functional equivalentof the cell’s gonads, its reproductive system.This misrepresentation is understandable. Throughout history, science haspredominantly been an “old boy’s club.” Because males reputedly think with theirgonads, confusing the cell’s nucleus with its brain is, in the light of thatbias, an understandable error.So, if the genes are not the brain, what is? The brain is actually the cellmembrane, the equivalent of the cell’s skin. Built into the membrane are proteinswitches that respond to the environmental signals by relaying their informationto internal protein pathways. A different membrane switch exists for almostevery environmental signal recognized by a cell. Some switches respond toestrogen, some to adrenaline, some to calcium, some to light waves, and so on.Although there may be one hundred thousand switches in a cell’s membrane, wedon’t have to study each one of them individually, because they all share thesame basic structure and function. Following is a conceptual illustration of agenetic membrane switch. Figure A: Each cell has receptor proteins and effector proteins that extendthrough the cell’s membrane, connecting its cytoplasm with the surroundingenvironment. Metaphorically,these proteins serve as switches that put the cell’smotor and gears into motion. Figure B: When the receptor protein receives asignal from the environment, it modifies its shape and connects with theeffector protein.005 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_005_r1.gif]Each membrane switch is a unit of perception, comprised of two fundamentalparts, a receptor protein and an effector protein. The receptor protein, as itsname implies, receives, or senses, signals from the environment. Upon receivingits primary complementary signal (Primary Signal in Figure B), the now activatedreceptor moves to and is, thus, able to bind to the switch’s effector protein.In the illustration on the right, it appears as if the receptor protein and theeffector protein are shaking hands (arrow in Figure B). It is this connectionthat allows information from outside the cell to be transmitted into the cellwhere it is used to engage behavior.When activated by a receptor, the effector protein sends a secondary signal(Secondary Signal in figure B) through the cytoplasm inside of the cell thatcontrols specific protein functions and pathways. The coordinated activity ofmembrane switches enables the cell to sustain its life by orchestratingmetabolism and physiology in response to an ever-changing environment.Receptor proteins provide the cell with an awareness of the elements of theenvironment, while the switch’s effector proteins generate signals, which arephysical sensations that regulate specific cell functions. Together, theseswitches, located in the cell membrane, provide “an awareness of the elements ofthe environment through a physical sensation.”14[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en17]That very phrase offers the key to unlocking the secret of life. Are you ready?Those words are the dictionary definition of perception, a word that’s Latinroots mean “comprehension” or, literally, “a taking in.” Consequently, theprotein switches in the cell membrane represent fundamental molecular units ofperception. Because these switches control the cell’s molecular pathways andspecific biological functions, we can confidently conclude that perceptionscontrol behavior!Also, dear readers—the fact that perceptions control behavior at both thecellular and the human level—is the real secret to life!New-Edge Biology Conclusion #3Protein perception switches in the cellmembrane respond to environmental signalsby regulating cell functions and behavior.THE NATURE OF DIS-EASESometimes, the body’s natural harmony breaks down, and we experience dis-ease,which is a reflection of the body’s inability to maintain normal control of itsfunction-providing systems. Because behavior is created through the interactionof proteins with their complementary signals, there are really only two sourcesof dis-ease: either the proteins are defective or the signals are distorted.About 5 percent of the world’s population is born with birth defects, whichmeans they have mutated genes that code for dysfunctional proteins. 15[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en18] Structurally deformed or defectiveproteins can “jam the machine,” disturb normal pathway functions, and impair thecharacter and quality of lives. However, 95 percent of the human populationarrives on this planet with a perfectly functional set of gene blueprints.Because the majority of us have a perfectly healthy genome and producefunctional proteins, illness in this group can likely be attributed to thenature of the signal. There are three primary situations in which signalscontribute to dysfunction and dis-ease.The first is trauma. If you twist or misalign your spine and physically impedethe transmission of the nervous system’s signals, it may result in a distortionof the information being exchanged between the brain and the body’s cells,tissues, and organs.The second is toxicity. Toxins and poisons in our system represent inappropriatechemistry that can distort the signal’s information on its path between thenervous system and the targeted cells and tissues. Altered signals, derived fromeither of these causes, can inhibit or modify normal behaviors and lead to theexpression of dis-ease.The third and most important influence of signals on the dis-ease process isthought, the action of the mind. Mind-related illnesses do not require thatthere be anything physically wrong with the body at the outset of the dis-ease.Health is predicated upon the nervous system’s ability to accurately perceiveenvironmental information and selectively engage appropriate, life-sustainingbehaviors. If a mind misinterprets environmental signals and generates aninappropriate response, survival is threatened because the body’s behaviorsbecome out of synch with the environment. We may not think that a thought couldbe enough to undermine an entire system, but, in fact, misperceptions can belethal.Consider the situation of a person with anorexia. While relatives and friendsclearly perceive that this skin-and-bones individual is near death, the anorexiclooks in a mirror and sees a fat person. Using this distorted view, whichresembles an image in a funhouse mirror, the anorexic’s brain attempts tocontrol a misperceived runaway weight gain, by—oops!—inhibiting the system’smetabolic functions.The brain, like any governing entity, seeks harmony. Neural harmony is expressedas a measure of congruency between the mind’s perceptions and the life weexperience.An interesting insight into how the mind creates harmony between its perceptionsand the real world is frequently illustrated in stage hypnosis shows. Avolunteer from the audience is invited onstage, hypnotized, and asked to pick upa glass of water, which the volunteer is told weighs one thousand pounds. Withthat misinformation, the volunteer struggles unsuccessfully with strainingmuscles, bulging veins, and perspiration. How can that be? Obviously the glassdoesn’t weigh one thousand pounds even though the mind of the subject firmlybelieves that it does.To manifest the perceived reality of a thousand pound glass of water, somethingthat cannot be lifted, the hypnotized subject’s mind fires a signal to themuscles used to lift the glass at the same time it fires contradictory signalsto the muscles used to set the glass down! This results in an isometric exercisewherein two groups of muscles work to oppose each other, which results in no netmovement—but a lot of strain and sweat.Cells, tissues, and organs do not question information sent by the nervoussystem. Rather, they respond with equal fervor to accurate life-affirmingperceptions and to self-destructive misperceptions. Consequently, the nature ofour perceptions greatly influences the fate of our lives.While most of us are aware of the healing influences of the placebo effect, feware aware of its evil twin, the nocebo effect. Just as surely as positivethoughts can heal, negative ones—including the belief we are susceptible to anillness or have been exposed to a toxic condition—can actually manifest theundesired realities of those thoughts.Japanese children allergic to a poison ivy-like plant took part in an experimentwhere a leaf of the poisonous plant was rubbed onto one forearm. 16[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en19] As a control, a nonpoisonous leafresembling the toxic plant was rubbed on the other forearm. As expected almostall of the children broke out in a rash on the arm rubbed with the toxic leafand had no response to the imposter leaf.What the children did not know was that the leaves were purposefully mislabeled.The negative thought of being touched by the poisonous plant led to the rashproduced by the nontoxic leaf! In the majority of cases, no rash resulted fromcontact with the toxic leaf that was thought to be the harmless control. Theconclusion is simple: positive perceptions enhance health, and negativeperceptions precipitate dis-ease. This mindbending example of the power ofbelief was one of the founding experiments that led to the science ofpsychoneuroimmunology.Considering that a minimum of one third of all medical healings are attributedto the placebo effect, what percentage of illness and disease might be theresult of negative thought in the nocebo effect? Perhaps more than we think,especially since psychologists estimate that 70 percent of our thoughts arenegative and redundant.17 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en20]Perceptions have a tremendous influence in shaping the character and experiencesof our lives. They’re the reason why those faith-filled folks can swig poisonand joyously play with deadly snakes. Perceptions shape the placebo and noceboeffects. They are more influential than positive thinking because they are morethan mere thoughts in your mind. Perceptions are beliefs that permeate everycell. Simply, the expression of the body is a complement to the mind’sperceptions, or, in simpler terms, believing is seeing!New-Edge Biology Conclusion #4Accurate perceptions encourage success;misperceptions threaten survival.Almost all of us have unknowingly acquired limiting, self-sabotagingmisperceptions that undermine our strength, health, and desires.As we will show in the next chapter, our most influential perceptual programshave mainly been acquired from others and do not necessarily support our ownpersonal goals and aspirations. In fact, many of our strengths and weaknesses,the parts of ourselves we own as who we are, are directly attributable tofamilial and cultural perceptions downloaded into our minds before we were sixyears old. Programmed perceptions acquired in these developmental years areprimarily responsible for health and behavioral issues experienced in our adultlives. Consider how many children never realize their full potential or dreamsbecause of limiting programming.18 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en21]Not surprisingly, these self-sabotaging programs also thwart us as we try tochange conditions in the world. This insight tells us that before we go out tochange the world, we must first look inward to change ourselves. Then, bychanging our beliefs, we do change the world.As with changing the world, changing ourselves sometimes requires more than goodintentions. We must understand the nature of the mind and how the brain’s divinedualities, the conscious and subconscious minds, control the expression of ourperceptions. In the next chapter, we will see how what we perceive locally is agateway to global evolution."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2ACT LOCALLY . . . EVOLVE GLOBALLY“In a shrinking world that can use a good shrink, we don’t need another theoryof evolution. What we need is a practice of evolution.”— Swami Beyondananda The promise of spontaneous evolution signifies nothing less than a globaltransformation. But before we can reshape our outer environment, we must firstbe fully aware of the world within.Beneath our skin is a bustling metropolis of 50 trillion cells, each of which isbiologically and functionally equivalent to a miniature human. This is not ahyperbolic claim made merely for impact. No, indeed, because once we see theremarkable similarity between our cells and ourselves, we will begin to learnsome of the processes and practices cells have refined over the course ofbillions of years. We will also gain insight into how our cells createdconsciousness. And, by becoming more aware about how that consciousness operateswithin the cells, we can learn to rewrite our limiting beliefs at this pivotaltime in our human evolution.Conventional wisdom holds that the fate and behavior of our internal cellularcitizens are preprogrammed in their genes. Since molecular biologists JamesWatson and Francis Crick discovered the genetic code in 1953, the public hasbeen imbued with the perception that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, acquiredfrom our parents at the moment of conception determines our traits andcharacteristics. The conventional view of genetics further has us believe thatour inherited gene programs are fixed and as unchangeable as a computer’sread-only program.The notion that our fate is indelibly inscribed in our genes was directlyderived from the now outdated scientific concept known as genetic determinism ,which would have us believe that we are victims of genetic forces outside of ourcontrol. Unfortunately, the assumption of powerlessness is a one-way street topersonal irresponsibility. Too many of us have said, “Hey, I can’t do anythingabout it anyway, so why should I care? Overweight? It runs in my family. Pass methe bonbons.”SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE GENESBy the 1980s, genetic scientists were convinced that genes controlled life. Theythus set out to map the human genome, intending to identify the complete set ofgenes that define all of the heritable traits of the human organism. They hopedthat, by revealing that code, they would find the key to finally preventing andcuring human illness.We will read more about the fate of the Human Genome Project later, but, fornow, let’s just say a surprising thing happened on the way to geneticengineering. Scientists began to uncover a revolutionary new view of how lifereally works and, in doing so, founded a new branch of science known asepigenetics.1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en22] Epigenetics has shakenthe foundations of biology and medicine to their core because it reveals that weare not victims but masters of our genes.For those who don’t know Greek, the prefix epi- means “over or above.” Studentsin high school and basic college biology courses are still learning aboutgenetic control, which is the notion that genes primarily control the traits oflife; however, the new science of epigenetic control reveals that life iscontrolled by something above the genes. Exciting new insights concerning whatthat something above the genes is provides a gateway to understanding our properrole as co-creators of our reality.As we learned in the previous chapter, environmental signals acting throughmembrane switches control cell functions. It turns out that environmentalsignals, using the same mechanisms, also regulate gene activity. In the case ofepigenetics, environmentally derived signals activate membrane switches thatsend secondary signals into the cell’s nucleus. Within the nucleus, thesesignals select gene blueprints and control the manufacture of specific proteins.This is far different than the conventional belief that genes turn themselves onand off. Genes are not emergent entities, meaning they do not control their ownactivity. Genes are simply molecular blueprints. And blueprints are designdrawings; they are not the contractors that actually construct the building.Epigenetics functionally represents the mechanism by which the contractorselects appropriate gene blueprints and controls the construction andmaintenance of the body. Genes do not control biology; they are used by biology.The conventional belief that the genome represents read-only programs thatcannot be influenced by the environment has now been proven to be one of thosethings we thought we knew, but we were wrong. Epigenetic mechanisms actuallymodify the readout of the genetic code. The creative power of epigenetics isrevealed in this fact: epigenetic mechanisms can edit the readout of a gene soas to create over 30,000 different variations of proteins from the same geneblueprint!2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en23]Depending on the nature of the environmental signals, the contractorcharacteristic of the epigenetic mechanism can modify a gene to produce eitherhealthy or dysfunctional protein products. In other words, a person can be bornwith healthy genes but, through a distortion in epigenetic signaling, candevelop a mutant condition such as cancer. On the positive side, the sameepigenetic mechanism can enable individuals born with potentially debilitatingmutations to create normal, healthy proteins and functions from their inheriteddefective genes.3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en24]Epigenetic mechanisms modify the readout of the genetic code so that genesrepresent read-write programs, not read-only programs. This means that lifeexperiences can actively redefine our genetic traits.This is a truly radical discovery. Where we once were certain that our genesmarked our destiny, new-edge science now tells us Nature is smarter than that.As organisms interact with the environment, their perceptions engage epigeneticmechanisms that fine-tune genetic expression in order to enhance theopportunities for survival.This environmental influence is dramatically revealed in studies of identicaltwins. At birth and shortly thereafter, twin siblings express almost the samegene activity from their identical genomes. However, as they age, their personalindividualized experiences and perceptions lead to activation of significantlydifferent sets of genes.4 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en25] News mediadelight in stories about the amazingly similar parallel lives led by twinsseparated at birth, to the extent that they may even end up with the same job ormarry partners with the same name. Although these stories are perceived asgeneralizations, they are extremely rare exceptions, and, more importantly, theyfail to consider the important period of prenatal behavioral programming thatprofoundly shapes the life and behavior of those twins when grown.5[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en26]Take a moment to fully comprehend what new-edge biology is revealing.Perceptions not only control behavior, they control gene activity as well. Thisrevised version of science emphasizes the reality that we actively control ourgenetic expression moment by moment, throughout our lives. We are learningorganisms that can incorporate life experiences into our genomes and pass themon to our offspring, who will then incorporate their life experiences into thegenome to further human evolution.Therefore, rather than perceiving ourselves as helpless victims of our genes, wemust now accept and own the empowering truth that our perceptions and responsesto life dynamically shape our biology and behavior.Now let’s take a look at how those all-powerful perceptions are actually shaped.FROM THE MICROCOSM OF THE CELL TO THE MACROCOSM OF THE MINDFor the first 3.8 billion years of life on this planet, the biosphere consistedof a massive population of individual single-celled organisms, such as bacteria,yeast, algae, and protozoa like the familiar amoeba and paramecium. About 700million years ago, individual cells started to assemble into multicellularcolonies. The collective awareness afforded in a community of cells was fargreater than that of an individual cell. Because awareness is a primary factorin an organism’s survival, the communal experience enhanced the opportunity forits citizens to stay alive and reproduce.The first cellular communities, like the earliest human communities, werehunter-gatherer clans wherein each member offered the same services to supportsurvival. However, as population densities of both cellular and humancommunities reached greater numbers, it became neither efficient nor effectivefor all individuals to do the same job. Evolution eventually led to specializedfunctions. For example, in human communities, some members focused on hunting,others on domestic chores, and some on child rearing. In cellular communities,specialization meant that some cells began to differentiate as digestive cells,others as heart cells, and still others as muscle cells.Most cells in human and animal bodies have no direct perception of theenvironment beyond the skin. Liver cells, for example, see what’s going on inthe liver but don’t directly know what’s going on in the world. Therefore, thebrain and nervous system must interpret environmental stimuli and send signalsto the cells, which then integrate and regulate life-sustaining functions of thebody’s organ systems to support survival in that perceived environment.The successful nature of multicellular communities allowed evolving brains todedicate vast numbers of cells to catalog, memorize, and integrate complexperceptions. Through evolutionary advances, the brain’s cellular populationacquired the ability to remember millions of experienced perceptions andintegrate them into a powerful database. Complex behavioral programs createdfrom this database endow the organism with the characteristic trait ofconsciousness, a term we use in its most fundamental context to mean “the stateof being awake and aware.”Many scientists prefer to think of consciousness as something an organism eitherhas or doesn’t have. However, the study of evolution suggests that consciousnessmechanisms evolved over time. Consequently, the character of consciousness wouldlikely express itself as a gradient of awareness from less-conscious inprimitive organisms to the unique character of self-consciousness manifest inhumans and other higher vertebrates. What we mean by self-consciousness isn’t “Ihope my hair looks okay,” but, rather, a quality of being both a participant inlife and an observer of life at the same time.The expression of self-consciousness is specifically associated with a smallevolutionary adaptation in the brain known as the prefrontal cortex. Theprefrontal cortex is the neurological platform that enables humans to realizetheir personal identity and experience the quality of thinking. Monkeys andother animals that do not express self-awareness will look in a mirror andalways perceive the image to be that of another creature. In contrast,neurologically advanced chimps looking in a mirror recognize the image as theirown reflection.6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en27]An important difference between the brain’s consciousness and the prefrontalcortex’s self-consciousness is that conventional consciousness enables anorganism to assess and respond to conditions in the environment that arerelevant at that moment. In contrast, self-consciousness enables the individualto factor in the consequences of his or her actions, not only in the presentmoment but also in the future.Self-consciousness is what enables us to be co-creators, not merely respondersto stimuli, meaning we can engage a self in the decision-making process. Whileconventional consciousness enables organisms to participate in the dynamics oflife’s theater, the quality of self-consciousness offers an opportunity to benot only an actor but also a member of the audience and even a director.Self-consciousness provides the option for self-reflection and the ability toreview and edit the performance.As significant as self-consciousness is to our own identity, it is actually asmall part of what we call the mind. While the self-conscious mind is engaged inself-reflection, another mind is monitoring the world and controlling everythingfrom our breathing to our driving—enter, from behind the curtain on centerstage, the subconscious mind.In conventional parlance, the brain’s mechanism associated with automatedstimulus-response behaviors is referred to as the subconscious mind, orunconscious mind, because this function requires neither conscious observationnor attention. Functions of the subconscious mind evolved long before theprefrontal cortex. Consequently, organisms unable to express self-consciousnessare fully able to operate a body and navigate the challenges of a dynamicenvironment. In a manner similar to lower organisms, humans, too, can cruise onautomatic pilot with self-regulating systems that manage themselves without needfor advice or input from the self-conscious mind.The subconscious mind is an astonishingly powerful information processor thatcan record perceptual experiences and forever play them back at the push of abutton. Interestingly, we sometimes only become aware of our subconscious mind’spush-button programs when someone else pushes our buttons.Actually, the entire image of pushing buttons is far too slow and linear todescribe the awesome data-processing capacity of the subconscious mind. It hasbeen estimated that the disproportionately larger brain mass devoted to thesubconscious mind can interpret and respond to over 40 million nerve impulsesper second. In contrast, the diminutive selfconscious mind’s prefrontal cortexonly processes about 40 nerve impulses per second. This means that, as aninformation processor, the subconscious mind is one million times more powerfulthan the self-conscious mind.7 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en28]In contrast to its computational wizardry, the subconscious mind has only amarginal aptitude for creativity, best compared to that of a precociousfive-year-old. While the self-conscious mind can express free will, thesubconscious mind primarily expresses prerecorded stimulus-response habits. Oncewe learn a behavior pattern—such as walking, getting dressed, or driving acar—we relegate those programs to the subconscious mind, which means that we cancarry out complex functions without paying attention.While the subconscious mind can run all internal systems and chew gum at thesame time, the much smaller prefrontal cortex responsible for self-consciousnesscan juggle only a small number of tasks simultaneously. Although its ability tomultitask is physically constrained, the trained self-conscious mind is quiteadept at single-tasking. It is the organ of focus and concentration.It was once thought that some of the body’s so-called involuntary functions,like the control of heartbeat, blood pressure, and body temperature, were beyondthe control of the self-conscious mind; however, we now know that persons withhigher mental evolution, such as yogis and other advanced meditators, can,indeed, control involuntary functions.This tells us that the subconscious and self-conscious components of the mindwork as a marvelous tag team. The subconscious mind controls every behavior thatis not attended to by the self-conscious mind. This, it turns out, is just abouteverything happening in present time! For most of us, the self-conscious mind isso preoccupied with thoughts about the past, the future, or some imaginaryproblem that we leave the day-to-day, moment-to-moment tasks to thesubconscious. Cognitive neuroscientists conclude that the self-conscious mindcontributes only about 5 percent of our cognitive activity. That means that 95percent of our decisions, actions, emotions, and behaviors are derived from theunobserved processing of the subconscious mind.8[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en29]WHO’S DRIVING OUR KARMA, ANYWAY?If you’ve ever said you’re of two minds about something, you were right. Themind that had that idea was your self-conscious mind, that small 40-bitprocessor that is the seat of cognitive thinking, personal identity, and freewill. It is the part of the mind that proclaims wants, desires, and intentions,and consequently the part that makes God laugh. The joke is that that part ofthe mind imagines who we think we are, but it controls only 5 percent or less ofour lives.The data reveals what those of us who tried positive thinking but got negativeresults sadly came to realize that our lives are not controlled by our consciouswishes or intentions. If you disbelieve, do the math. Our subconscious isrunning the show 95 percent of the time. Therefore, our fate is actually underthe control of recorded programs, or habits, that have been derived frominstincts and the perceptions acquired in our life experiences.The most powerful and influential programs in the subconscious mind are the onesthat were recorded first. During the extremely important formative periodbetween gestation and six years of age, our fundamental life-shaping programswere acquired by observing and listening to our primary teachers—our parents,siblings, and local community. Unfortunately, as psychiatrists, psychologists,and counselors are keenly aware, much of what we learned was based onmisperceptions that are now expressed as limiting and self-sabotaging beliefs.Most parents don’t realize their words and actions are continuously recorded bytheir child’s subconscious mind, which compiles an imprint of early lifeexperiences. When a young child is frequently scolded as being bad, the childdoes not comprehend the nuance that this is a temporary condition associatedwith a recent deed. Instead, their young mind registers this declaration as apermanent condition that defines who they are. The same is true with transmittedbeliefs, spoken or unspoken, that a child is undeserving, not good enough orsmart enough, or that they are sickly or weak.These unwitting parental pronouncements directly download into the child’ssubconscious. Because the role of the mind is to create coherence between itsprograms and real life, the brain unconsciously generates appropriate (orinappropriate) behavioral responses that assure the truth of its programmedperceptions. Once acquired, subconscious programs automatically manifest theirperceptions as false realities that shape an individual’s life.Let’s apply this to an unfortunate real-life experience. Imagine you are afive-year-old child throwing a tantrum at the mall because you want a certaintoy. To silence your outburst in a public place, your father—upsethimself—blurts out something his parents said to him when he threw a tantrum:“You don’t deserve it!” Fast-forward 20 or 30 years, and now you are an adult onthe threshold of a new job that will offer fantastic financial reward. You’vebeen entertaining wonderful thoughts about your future prospects. Then all of asudden, glitches and setbacks arise. The road to wealth that once seemed clearnow seems blocked. You know you have the ability to succeed, but all of a suddenthings go wrong, your new behavior becomes erratic and unprofessional—and yourprospective employer notices.“What’s happening?” you ask. The problem is that your subconscious mind’sprograms are conflicting with your conscious mind’s desire. While yourself-conscious mind is positive and hopeful about the opportunities, therecorded message from your dad—“You don’t deserve it!”—is subversivelyprogramming your subconscious mind’s behavior. As with the hypnotized individualtrying to lift a glass of water that weighs a misperceived one thousand pounds,your subconscious mind is dutifully engaging in self-sabotaging behaviors toassure your reality matches your program—and chances are you don’t even knowthis is happening.Why? Because the automated programs are running the show while your consciousmind is preoccupied with other thoughts, such as how you are going to spend theextra salary. Consequently, when the self-conscious mind is engaged, it usuallydoes not observe the automatic behaviors being generated by the subconsciousmind. And because subconscious programs encompass 95 percent of what we do, mostof our own behavior is invisible to us!For example, let’s say you have a friend, Bill, whom you’ve known sincechildhood. Being familiar with him and his family, you recognize that Bill’sbehavior closely resembles that of his father. Then one day you casually remark,“You know, Bill, you’re just like your dad.” Bill backs away in shock, indignantthat you could even suggest such a thing. “How can you say something soridiculous?” he demands.The cosmic joke is that everyone except Bill can see that his behavior resembleshis dad’s. Why? Because when Bill engages in subconscious behavioral programsdownloaded in his youth as a result of observing his dad, his self-consciousmind is, at the same time, busy in thought. At those moments, his automaticsubconscious programs operate without observation; hence they are unconscious.As another familiar example of how invisible behavior operates, imagine that youare driving your car while having an intense conversation with a friend in thepassenger’s seat. You become so involved in the discussion that only later, whenyour gaze returns to the road, do you realize that you haven’t paid attention todriving for the last several minutes. Because the self-conscious mind waspreoccupied with the conversation, the car was being driven by the subconsciousmind’s autopilot. If you were asked to describe your driving during that hiatus,you would say, “I don’t know. I wasn’t paying attention.”Aha! That’s the point. When the conscious mind is busy, we do not observe ourown programmed subconscious behaviors. We aren’t paying attention! Consequently,when life does not work out as planned, we rarely recognize that we very likelycontributed to our own disappointments. Since we are generally unaware of theinfluence of our own subconscious behaviors, we naturally perceive ourselves asvictims of external forces. Unfortunately, victimhood becomes a self-fulfillingcondition. If we perceive ourselves as victims, the brain’s function is tomanifest that truth within our reality. As victims, we perceive that we arepowerless to manifest our intentions. Nothing could be further from the truth.As we will see, the database of perceptions and beliefs programmed in our mindsis a primary factor in shaping our lives. The good news is that we actuallywield power over the contents of that database. Becoming conscious of oursubconscious beliefs and programming is the gateway to spontaneous evolution.TRANSFORMING THE TRANCEBecause our programmed perceptions directly shape the biology, behavior, andcharacter of our lives, it is important that we know the three primary sourcesof our perceptions.Our first programmed perceptions are acquired through inheritance. Our genomescontain behavioral programs that provide fundamental reflex behaviors referredto as instincts. Pulling your hand out of an open flame is a genetically derivedbehavior. More complex instincts include the ability for newborn babies to swimlike dolphins or the activation of innate healing mechanisms to eliminate acancerous growth. Genetically inherited instincts are perceptions acquired fromNature.The second source of life-controlling perceptions comes from experientialmemories downloaded into the subconscious mind. These powerful learnedperceptions represent the contribution from nurture. Among the earliestperceptions of life to be downloaded into the subconscious mind were ourmother’s emotional patterns while we were in the womb.Nutrition isn’t the only thing a mother provides for her fetus. A complexchemistry of maternal emotional signals, hormones, and stress factors also crossthe placental barrier and influence fetal physiology and development. When themother is happy, so is the fetus. When the mother is in fear, so is the fetus.When the mother thinks thoughts of rejection toward her fetus, the fetal nervoussystem programs itself with the emotion of rejection.Sue Gerhardt’s valuable book Why Love Matters emphasizes that the fetal nervoussystem records womb experiences.9 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en30] Bythe time the baby is born, emotional information downloaded from the mother’sexperiences has already shaped half of that individual’s personality!However, the most influential perceptual programming of the subconscious mindoccurs from birth through age six. During that time, the child’s brain isrecording all sensory experiences as well as learning complex motor programs forspeech, crawling, standing, and advanced activities like running and jumping.Simultaneously, the child’s sensory systems are fully engaged, downloadingmassive amounts of information about the world and how it works.By observing the behavioral patterns of people in their immediateenvironment—primarily parents, siblings, and relatives—children learn todistinguish acceptable and unacceptable social behaviors. It’s important torealize that perceptions acquired before the age of six become the fundamentalsubconscious programs that shape the character of an individual’s life.During this time of accelerated learning, Nature facilitates the enculturationprocess by developmentally enhancing the subconscious mind’s ability to downloadmassive amounts of information. We know this thanks to our study of brainwavesin adults and children. Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings from adult brainsreveal that neural electrical activity is correlated with different states ofawareness. Adult EEG readings show that the human brain operates on at leastfive different frequency levels, each associated with a different brain state:Brain Activity Frequency Range Adult State Associated with Frequency Range Delta0.5-4 HzSleeping/UnconsciousTheta 4-8 HzImagination/ReverieAlpha 8-12 HzCalmconsciousnessBeta 12-35 HzFocused consciousnessGamma >35 HzPeak performance Chart revealing predominant EEG activity state during stages of childdevelopment006 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_006_r1.gif]EEG vibrations continuously shift from state to state over the whole range offrequencies during normal brain processing in adults. However, brain frequenciesin developing children display a radically different behavior. EEG vibrationrates and their corresponding states evolve in incremental stages over time.10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en31]The predominant brain activity during the child’s first two years of life isdelta, the lowest EEG frequency range.Between two and six years of age, the child’s brain activity ramps up andoperates primarily in the range of theta. While in the theta state, childrenspend much of their time mixing the imaginary world with the real world.The calm consciousness associated with emerging alpha activity only becomes apredominant brain state after age six.By twelve years, the brain expresses all frequency ranges, although its primaryactivity is in the beta state of focused consciousness. Children leaveelementary education behind at this age and enter into the more intense academicprograms of middle school.In case you missed it, here is a very important fact: children do not expressthe alpha EEG frequencies of conscious processing as a predominant brain stateuntil after they are six years old. The predominant delta and theta activityexpressed by children younger than six signifies that their brains are operatingat levels below consciousness. Delta and theta brain frequencies define a brainstate known as a hypnagogic trance—the same neural state that hypnotherapistsuse to directly download new behaviors into the subconscious minds of theirclients.In other words, the first six years of a child’s life are spent in a hypnotictrance!A child’s perceptions of the world are directly downloaded into the subconsciousduring this time, without discrimination and without filters of the analyticalself-conscious mind, which doesn’t fully exist. Consequently, our fundamentalperceptions about life and our role in it are learned without our having thecapacity to choose or reject those beliefs. We were simply programmed.The Jesuits were aware of this programmable state and proudly boasted, “Give methe child until it is seven years old and I will give you the man.” They knewthe child’s trance state facilitated a direct implanting of Church dogma intothe subconscious mind. Once programmed, that information would inevitablyinfluence 95 percent of that individual’s behavior for the rest of his or herlife.The absence of conscious processing, that is the alpha EEG activity, as well asthe simultaneous engagement of a hypnagogic trance during the formative stagesof a child’s life, are a logical necessity. First of all, the thinking processesassociated with the self-conscious mind’s functions cannot operate from a blankslate. Self-conscious information processing requires a working database oflearned perceptions. Consequently, before a person can expressself-consciousness, the brain must go about its primary task of acquiring aworking awareness of the world by directly downloading experiences andobservations into the subconscious mind.However, there is a very serious downside to acquiring awareness by this method.The consequence is so profound that it not only impacts the life of theindividual, it can also alter an entire civilization. The problem is that wedownload our perceptions and beliefs about life years before we acquire theability for critical thinking. When, as young children, we download limiting orsabotaging beliefs, those perceptions or misperceptions become our truths. Ifour platform is one of misperception, our subconscious mind will dutifullygenerate behaviors that are coherent with those programmed truths.Perceptions acquired during this pivotal developmental period can actuallyoverride genetically endowed instincts. Consider, for example, that every one ofus can instinctually swim like a dolphin the moment we emerge from the birthcanal. “Why then,” you might ask, “do we have to teach children to swim? Why areso many afraid of the water?”If you are a parent, think about your likely reaction when your toddler getsanywhere near open water. Concerned for the safety of your child, you rush topull him or her away. However, in the baby’s mind, your frantic behavior istaken to mean that water is life-threatening. Fear, acquired from the perceptionthat water is dangerous, overrides the instinctual ability to swim and makes theformerly proficient child susceptible to drowning.By now you may be thinking, “Gee, this is great. I’m so relieved to find I amnot a victim of my genetics. However, I now appear to be a victim of myprogramming. What chance does my little 40-bit conscious processor have againstthe subconscious mega-computer of doom? Where’s the good news?” The good newsis, whatever has been programmed can be deprogrammed and reprogrammed.That brings us to a third source of perceptions that shape our lives and whichalso derive from the actions of the self-conscious mind. Unlike the push-buttonreflexive programming of the subconscious mind, the self-conscious mind is acreative platform capable of mixing and morphing perceptions with an infusion ofimagination in a process that generates an unlimited number of beliefs andbehavioral variations. The quality of the self-conscious mind endows organismswith one of the most powerful forces in the Universe—the opportunity to expressfree will.Sources of Life-Shaping Perceptions1. Genome Programming (Instincts)2. Memories in the Subconscious Mind3. Actions of the Self-conscious MindFROM THE BLAME GAME TO RESPONSE-ABILITYMost of our personal and cultural problems arise from the fact that our ownsubconscious behaviors are largely invisible to us. These behaviors, as we’velearned, were recorded indiscriminately, derived from the words and actions ofothers, themselves no doubt programmed with many of the same limiting beliefs.While our conscious mind is trying to move us toward our dreams, unbeknownst tous, our invisible subconscious programs may be sabotaging us and impeding ourprogress.Fortunately, the subconscious is not an ominous Freudian pit of evil anddarkness. It’s simply a record-and-playback mechanism that downloads lifeexperiences onto behavioral tapes. While the self-conscious mind is creative,the subconscious mind engages previously recorded programs. Unlikeself-consciousness that is overseen by an entity (you), the subconscious mind ismore closely related to a machine, which means there is no conscious entity tocontrol your subconscious programs.However, the next time you are talking to yourself with the hope of changingsabotaging subconscious programs, remember this: using reason to communicatewith and change your subconscious has the same effect as trying to change aprogram on a cassette tape by talking to the tape player. In neither case isthere an entity or component within the mechanism that will respond to yourdialogue.The good news is that subconscious programs are not fixed and unchangeable. Wedo have the ability to rewrite our limiting beliefs and, in the process, takecontrol of our lives. However, changing the programs requires that we activate aprocess other than engaging in a futile, one-sided dialogue with thesubconscious mind. A resource list of techniques that have been shown tofacilitate the rewriting of disempowering, limiting, and self-sabotaging beliefsin the subconscious mind is provided in the endnotes of this book.Once we realize that our past behaviors were predicated on the invisibleoperation of the subconscious mind, we afford ourselves the opportunity toforgive ourselves. It helps to know that our invisible behaviors are programsprimarily derived from the beliefs of other people, who, in turn, wereprogrammed by others, backward through time. Perhaps instead of original sin, weshould be talking about original misperception.In any case, neither our parents nor their parents were aware they were actingout a pre-written script. In this regard, it is important to remember that allthe people with whom we have ever interacted were also engaging in invisiblebehaviors derived from programs downloaded into their infant subconscious minds.Consequently, they, too, were unaware of how their invisible participation andcontributions impacted our lives.These insights are extremely important in trying to bring peace to a world wheremost citizens are unconsciously responding to cultural wrongs perpetratedgenerations ago by and to their ancestors. From this perspective, it behooves usto step back and reconsider our emotionally charged notions regarding blame,guilt, victims, and perpetrators. As confirmed by recent scientific discoveries,the Biblical injunction, “Forgive them; they know not what they do,” makesperfect sense.By studying the life and teachings of Jesus, we can see that he employed thisnew science of consciousness in his biology and behavior. This is why Jesusemphasized that, were it not for our limiting beliefs, all of us could performthe miracles he did. He was on target when he declared that we could renew ourlives with our beliefs. Most importantly, he saw the reality of forgiveness asthe most important path toward peace. If enough of us perform this simple localact, we would, indeed, advance our global evolution.Based on the scientific insights regarding how our mind works, the new-edgebiology implores us to heed the advice of all the great prophets: to forgive thetransgressions of others. We have been shackled with emotional chains wrought bydysfunctional behaviors, programmed by the stories of the past. Throughforgiveness, we unshackle ourselves and others, allowing all of us to let go ofthe old story. Then, and only then, will we be free to create our positivefuture.As Dr. Fred Luskin, an expert in counseling, health psychology, and forgiveness,says in his book Forgive for Good, “Forgiveness allows us not to stay stuck inthe past.”11 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en32] Colin Tipping, anotherforgiveness guru and author of Radical Forgiveness, goes even further insuggesting that forgiveness “transforms the victim archetype” once and forall.12 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en33]In addition to our individual subconscious programming, society also holdsinvisible collective beliefs. Remember Bill who couldn’t see that he was actingjust like his father? Consider that our individual subconscious culturalperceptions are really shared beliefs and are, therefore, invisible to others aswell. Consider how that situation makes those beliefs that much more damaging.Indeed, philosophy ultimately determines biology because our brain’s function isto create coherence between our collective subconscious beliefs and the realitywe experience in our world. The next step in our journey is to see how ourcultural storylines have evolved and how the story is likely to unfold next."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3A NEW LOOK AT THE OLD STORY“Stick to your story and you’re stuck with it.”— Swami BeyondanandaA STORY ABOUT A STORYA friend of ours, a psychologist in his mid-50s, found himself in the midst of afamily crisis concerning his aging parents. The situation had nothing to do withillness or infirmity. The tumultuous issue was far more unusual. After havingbeen divorced for 50 years, remarried and then widowed, our friend’s parentsdecided to reconcile their differences. In their mid-80s and in reasonably goodhealth, they reunited and chose to spend whatever time they had left together.What a great story! So what’s the problem? Simply this: the children from theoriginal family and from the two new families the parents had started were beingasked to make a great adjustment. After having heard about acrimony and betrayalall their lives and having made this story their own—and having spent thousandsof dollars and years in therapy talking about it—they now had to adjust to theirparents’ sudden reversal! The children had to come to grips with the fact thattheir parents, at a point in their lives when every moment is precious, decidedit was more important to share a few years of happiness than to hold on to anold story that no longer served them.We humans live and die by our stories. We are a meaning-making species, and themeaning we make becomes as important as life itself. Consider what happened backin the late 1930s when Orson Welles broadcast his famed radio program “War ofthe Worlds.” Those who tuned in a few minutes late thought the fictionalbroadcast was an actual news report informing them that Martians had invadedEarth. The result was mass hysteria and panicky evacuation of neighborhoods.Some people even considered suicide because this change in story was toodevastating to handle.1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en34]We build our lives on the foundation of our stories. And the more we invest in astory, the more important it becomes to continue investing in that story, evenafter it’s clear the story no longer works. Consider the Palestinians andIsraelis in the Middle East or, until recently, the Catholics and Protestants inNorthern Ireland. Animosity continues because each death or indignity builds thestory one story higher.Many of our stories have been with us for millennia. But what if those supposedtruths we learned about the world were wrong? What if we have it backward? Whatif the struggle we’ve been taught is natural turns out to be the most unnaturalthing we could be doing? What if the social Darwinists were mistaken? What ifcooperation, not competition, is the key to survival?Today, as the Doomsday Clock creeps inexorably toward the Midnight Hour, mightit be that our collective story has delivered us to this dangerous precipice?Might we learn something from our friend’s elderly parents who decided their oldstory could no longer serve them in their remaining precious days?Now our entire species faces the same choice: your story or your life? Ourstoried history is filled with familiar tales of war, feuding, exploitation, andmistrust. In front of us, however, is a new story that holds the key to oursurvival as a species. Do we go down with our old story, or do we wise up andrise up with a new one?Insanity has been defined as “doing the same thing over and over while expectingdifferent results.” Therefore, we pose a provocative question: what would happenif our insane world went sane?HOW TO CHOOSE AN “OFFICIAL” TRUTH PROVIDERTo fully understand our current story, how to change it, and why we must changeit, we must first look at the history of stories.Since the dawn of human consciousness, we have sought to answer three perennialquestions:1. How did we get here?2. Why are we here?3. Now that we’re here, how do we make the best of it?Whoever or whatever entity provides the most satisfactory answers to thesequestions becomes society’s “official” truth provider. But from time to time,the privilege of holding that title has changed hands. At certain pivotalpoints, civilization has faced challenges for which old answers no longersufficed. At such times, humans reached out for new and more functionalexplanations of life. Society seems to be at such a time now, on the thresholdof adopting a new worldview and yet still stuck in old metaphors andexplanations.Throughout history, people have applied two different descriptors on the natureof human existence: static and dynamic. Static stories show the world asunchanging and cyclical. Often these stories are based on predictable, repeatingpatterns of Nature and the stars, along with the belief that whatever happenedlast year or over the last ten thousand years will likely happen again. An iconthat best represents the character of a static civilization would be a circleor, better yet, a snake circling back to bite its own tail.Dynamic stories demonstrate progress, based on evolution and learning. Historyclearly reveals that humans profoundly changed behavior when they encounterednew information and experiences. Our ancestors discovered fire, made tools,invented the wheel, learned to hunt and plant seeds, created weapons, and builtdwellings. In the past one hundred years, technological innovations have notonly changed our lives, they’ve impacted every species on the planet. An iconicimage for a dynamic human existence would be a moving arrow as a vector ofprogress or, better yet, a zooming rocket.So which story is true? Do we live in a cyclical, ever-repeating pattern? Or dowe evolve and grow? The answer is yes. And yes. Both situations occursimultaneously.Aboriginal people and those who live close to the land survive by maintainingharmony with the cycles of Nature. Living in balance provides for survival butdoes not encourage or, for that matter, require technological progress.However, Western civilization and a growing number of Asian nations have beenpreoccupied with the arrow of progress. Unfortunately, the glamour of technologyhas eclipsed humanity’s connection with Nature, and the pursuit of technologicaladvancement has contributed to disharmony, imbalance, and global crises. Ourarrow of progress has become an out-of-control rocket careening from onecatastrophe to the next.To survive—and thrive—must we make a choice between static and dynamic, betweenwheatgrass and cell phones? Fortunately, we need not answer with an either-orresponse. Rather, we can choose a both-and solution. For one thing, lifewouldn’t exist without technology. As cellular communities evolved fromfree-living individual cells to form closely packed, social, multicellularorganisms, technology became an evolutionary mandate. To build and operate thesemassive bodies, cells developed the necessary technology to create lightweightstructural supports (bones), cables of steel-like collagen (connective tissue),malleable, moldable reinforcement materials (fibrocartilage), and hundreds ofother biological innovations. What makes those technological structures soamazing is that they are not found in the cells, but were created by cells andassembled in their environment through purposeful cellular interactions. Solet’s show some respect for technology! Without it, we might not be here.Clearly, the nature of Nature is two-fold—to simultaneously change while stayingthe same. So, what happens when we combine static patterns with dynamicevolution? Simply morph a circle, representing cyclical existence, with avector, symbolizing directional progress, and voilà: we end up with auniverse-friendly spiral of evolution. Uniting the principles of harmony andbalance with the principles of technological evolution leads to aself-sustaining and thriving civilization. The circle represents cyclical existence, harmony, and balance. The vectorsymbolizes directional progress and technological evolution. Combined, theycreate a universe-friendlyspiral of evolution toward a self-sustaining andthriving civilization.007 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_007_r1.jpg]However, be forewarned; such a solution requires rewriting basic beliefs thatunderlie our present culture. Fortunately, we have precedent to aid us; thiswill not be the first time that new thought has changed the course of humanity.In the last 8,000 years, Western civilization has rewritten its missionstatement four times, each time precipitating an historic social upheaval.BASAL PARADIGMS: A SHORT HISTORY OF STORYArchaeologists and historians reveal that civilizations around the world haveexperienced four basal paradigms, that is, agreed-upon explanations forexistence: animism, polytheism, monotheism, and materialism . As each stagereached the limits of its understanding and influence, an evolution occurred inwhich a new stage emerged that both refuted the previous paradigm and alsoretained vestiges either as an integrated understanding or as an isolated holdout.The character and fate of each version of civilization is predicated on howpeople perceive their existence in relationship with the cosmos. From the dawnof civilization, humans have subdivided the Universe into two polarizeddomains—the material realm and the nonmaterial realm. The material realmrepresents the physical universe and is comprised of matter. The nonmaterialrealm represents invisible forces that the ancients referred to as spirit andtoday’s scientists call energy fields. Both modern scientists and the ancientmystics agree that nonmaterial forces greatly influence our human experience.Our discussion treats energy fields and spirits as interchangeable terms.The four basal paradigms that shape each phase of civilization define thatculture’s relationship with the material and nonmaterial realms. Some culturesrecognize the spiritual realm as the most important factor controlling thecharacter of life on Earth, while others emphasize the material realm as primalin shaping the Universe. Some civilizations believe that both realms arecausative factors in determining life’s experiences. Plotting a timeline ofWestern civilization’s evolution on a chart to measure society’s perceivedrelationship with the cosmos offers amazing insight into the evolution andfuture of humanity.We use the following illustration to trace a civilization’s beliefs in regard totheir perceived relationship with the spiritual and material realms. In FigureA, the realms are designated as separate elements. Figure B. is a more realisticexpression in which beliefs that emphasize the material or spiritual realms arepresented as overlapping gradients that range from 100 percent belief in theprimacy of spirituality to 100 percent belief in the primacy of materialreality. The horizontal midline represents a balance of 50 percent emphasis onthe material and 50 percent emphasis on the spiritual. Figure A: Spirit represents the nonmaterial spiritual realm. Matterrepresentsthe material physical realm.008 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_008_r1.gif] Figure B: In reality, Spirit and Matter overlap, creating a continuum between100% Spirit / 0% Matter and 0% Spirit / 100% Matter.009 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_009_r1.gif]The midline in Figure B represents the arrow of advancing time along which wewill plot the path of civilization’s evolution. An accelerating succession fromone basal paradigm to the next through history reveals that humanity is evolvingat an exponential rate. Passage through one level of awareness provides a deeperunderstanding that facilitates a more rapid evolution into and through the nextlevel of awareness. As we shall see by adding dates to this timeline, time istruly speeding up.All indications are that civilization is now on the brink of evolving into itsfifth basal paradigm. But before we go there, let’s take a look at where we’vebeen.ANIMISM: MAKE ME ONE WITH EVERYTHINGAnimism is, perhaps, the most ancient religious practice and is believed to havehad its origins among primitive cultures in the Neolithic, or Stone Age, around8000 B.C.E. It is founded on the belief that the spirit is universal, existingin all things—animate or inanimate. Because animism represents a culture basedupon a perfect balance between the material and spiritual realms, we have placedit on the figure’s midline. During the Animism period, the prevailing paradigm was the inherentbalancebetween Spirit and Matter.010 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_010_r1.gif]Derived from the word anima, which is Latin for “breath” or “soul,” animism isthe spiritual experience of the Garden of Eden wherein there is no distinctionbetween the self and the environment. Everything—rain, sky, rocks, trees,animals, and, of course, humans—possesses an intangible spirit. And, while everypiece of Nature experiences a single spirit, all of the world’s spirits arecollectively part of a whole.Lest we imagine that the Garden of Eden is an invention of the Judeo-Christianreligious tradition, mythologist Joseph Campbell observes that some version ofthis story is universal to all human cultures.2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en35] The universality of this mythindicates a commonly held primal memory of our connection with all that is.Animism still exists in a few places among indigenous people. For AustralianAborigine, the spiritual realm is their true reality. What appears to be life inthe physical realm is, quite literally, perceived as a waking dream state. Thus,the veil between this world and the next, between matter in the material realmand invisible forces in the spiritual realm, is indeed thin. To some ancientpeoples, time itself doesn’t really exist and every moment is just another now.Animism offers these answers to the perennial questions:1. How did we get here?We are children of Mother Earth (material realm) and Father Sky (spiritualrealm).2. Why are we here?To tend the Garden and thrive.3. Now that we are here, how do we make the best of it?By living in balance with Nature.Animism is, perhaps, the closest that humankind has come to balancing itsemphasis on spirit and matter since the Garden of Eden. During the paradigm ofanimism, harmony prevailed between the invisible spiritual realm and the visiblematerial realm. Everything was one with the same One. If life were only staticand cyclical in nature, we would still be in the Garden, fully integrated in andvirtually indistinguishable from our surroundings, wearing a fig leaf or less.People would be like all of the other animals in what would amount to a greatglobal petting zoo.But some power or incentive, perhaps innate human curiosity, sent our ancientancestors on a path outside the idyllic Garden so that we, as a species, couldobserve, evolve, and become knowledgeable in the world. What theologysubsequently ascribed as our downfall from the grace of innocence or ourseparation from God was, in reality, an “up-wising” that has motivatedhumanity’s evolution through our quest for understanding and awareness.With one bite of the Apple of Knowledge, Earth shook, the unity of the Gardenwas fractured, and civilization set out on a path to experience the separaterealms of spirit and matter. However, there was a significant fly in theointment: in order to act as observers of the world, our ancestors had to standoutside and look in. This perspective significantly changed their relationshipwith Nature. All of a sudden, the Universe was subdivided into me and not me.And somehow, all those forces that had become part of not me had to be mollifiedlest me and others like me be victimized by the very forces me and we once sawas being in balanced harmony; that is, one, with all.POLYTHEISM: THE FIRST SPIRITUAL SUBDIVISIONAs humans began to emphasize the difference between me and not me, the unity ofthe Garden’s oneness gave way to “spiritual subdivision.” Untethered from thephysical world, the spiritual realm took on an energy of its own.Polytheism came into prominence around 2000 B.C.E. when society disconnectedfrom the oneness of animism through the introduction of a multitude of spiritualdeities. In separating spirit from matter, polytheists coalesced the spiritualrealm into a variety of iconic gods representing Nature’s elements. And wouldn’tyou know, each of those deities demanded that they be honored with specialrituals and ceremonies in order to ensure humankind’s continued health andwell-being. In seeking the answers to life’s mysteries in the spiritual realm,polytheists began to disconnect from Nature. With the advent of polytheism, the prevailing paradigm began to shift into theSpirit realm.011 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_011_r1.gif]The culmination of the polytheistic epoch came when the Greek gods andgoddesses, who exhibited human and superhuman qualities, decided to live incrystal mansions atop Mount Olympus, from which they “commuted,” oftenmasquerading in various disguises. As a result, real people never knew if someperson or creature was, in reality, a god.The implications were weighty: fooling around with fickle gods could lead todisaster. Therefore, the message was simple: live in harmony as if everyone andeverything were god because the last thing you’d ever want to do was get on thewrong side of an entity who would later get the last laugh by making you roll aboulder uphill every day for eternity.Polytheists offered new answers to the perennial questions:1. How did we get here?We came from chaos.2. Why are we here?To please the whimsy of mischievous gods.3. Now that we are here, how do we make the best of it?Don’t anger the gods.Seeking explanations for what primitive people took for granted, persons livingduring the paradigm of polytheism birthed the first philosophers. Greek thoughtevolved into two distinct and mutually exclusive points of view.The first, popularized by Democritus (460-370 B.C.E.), suggested the primacy ofmatter. Democritus coined the word atom, which means “uncuttable.” He surmisedthat invisible and irreducible atoms, the smallest bits of material reality,were at the core of every physical structure and that the Universe consisted ofatoms suspended in a void. To Democritus and his followers, the only thing thatmattered was matter. In other words, what you see is all there is.In contrast, Socrates (470-399 B.C.E.) offered a philosophy with a vastlydifferent point of view. He perceived the nature of the Universe as a duality.On one hand, there was a nonmaterial realm in which thoughts take on form. Themore common term for form, as used by Socrates, was soul. He also said thatforms in the non-physical world were perfect, while the tangible material realmrepresented an approximation or a “crude shadow” of perfect forms. For example,a person could imagine a perfect chair, but the constructed chair would, atbest, only approximate the perfection of the original thought.As polytheism matured, the Greeks allowed both Democritic and Socratic points ofview to coexist.MONOTHEISM: GOD DOESN’T LIVE HERE ANYMOREAfter watching the gods cavort and wreak havoc for a few millennia, it was timeto once again move the story along the path of evolution and deeper into thespiritual realm.Just as children of a certain age begin to sense a need for order anddiscipline, the search for spiritual understanding led to monotheism and beliefin an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent One God who dictates the rules forall. Not only was this God completely out of this world, but He promised us acushy place out of this world as well, so long as we lived according to Hisrules—at least those presented by His holy missionaries here on Earth.While the minority population of Hebrews in the Middle East had been worshippingone God for 2,000 years, Christianity advanced monotheism, with its belief in asingle, all-encompassing God as the dominant theological paradigm of the Westernworld. Monotheism took the prevailing paradigm deep into the Spirit realm.012 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_012_r1.gif]In the first millennium after Christ, the rise of the Church of Rome provided awonderful example of how a new stage of civilization can subsume and restructurevestiges held over from a former society. Many idols and feasts from thepreceding pagan Roman civilization experienced extreme makeovers and returned asChristian icons and festivals.Under the auspices of Albertus Magnus and his student Thomas Aquinas, the Churchrevamped the 1,500-year-old version of science and philosophy handed down fromthe Golden Age of Greece. They winnowed out objectionable polytheistic rhetoricand modified the contents so as to reconcile them with Old and New Testament.Through his synthesis of Christian and Aristotelian philosophy, Aquinas createdNatural Theology, a belief system that strove to understand God through a studyof Nature.The Judeo-Christian Church was particularly drawn to Socrates’ notion of adualistic universe and his concept of a perfect form or soul. The Church taughtthat the imperfect life in this crude shadow of the material realm, Earth,represents what modern visionary activist Caroline Casey called a “spiritualhardship post.”3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en36] The planet is merelya stage to live out morality plays, a way station on the path to perfection inthe invisible Kingdom of Heaven. This last-shall-be-first,suffer-now-and-party-later selling point made an otherwise intolerable thislife—in the service of opulent higher-ups—a stepping-stone to a blissfulafterlife for the soul.Simply stated, monotheism represented a full emphasis on the spiritual realmwhile the material world was linked with damnation. Therefore, while living inthe monotheistic paradigm, civilization became solely invested in the spiritualrealm and soared to its maximum deviation from the balance point at the midlineof the timeline. Humankind became so focused on the promised life out of thisworld that life became out of balance in this world.A philosophical difference between polytheism and the new monotheistic paradigmwas the location and accessibility of the Divine Powers. While the Greek godslived on Mount Olympus, the new Christian God had an unpublished addresssomewhere in the High Heavens.Being above it all, this One God naturally needed a chain of command, from thehierarchy all the way to the “lowerarchy.” Now that we humans were fullyseparated from the Creator, mere mortals needed priests to serve asintermediaries. Missionaries enhanced the Church’s power and their personalprowess by traveling the world converting animistic primitives who were alreadycommuning with their creator with their every breath and doing it very well,thank you.Monotheists answered the three perennial questions this way:1. How did we get here?Divine intervention.2. Why are we here?To live out morality plays.3. Now that we are here, how do we make the best of it?Obey the Scriptures—or else.While asserting that life was short and brutal, the Church was making a verycompelling offer: do as we say and you, too, will be able to enter the PearlyGates to an afterlife with the one and only God. Their marketing plan was directand highly effective: Buy our product; get to Heaven. Don’t buy our product; gostraight to Hell.But along with the religious hierarchy came lots of rules, not to mentiontorture and repression in the name of Father God. And with self-proclaimedinfallibility came absolute knowledge. Given that knowledge is power, absoluteknowledge is absolute power. Therefore, questioning the Church’s claim ofinfallibility was deemed to be heresy, punishable by death, which gaveincredible power to the Church’s unchallengeable authority.The Church became so preoccupied with its absolute knowledge, so corrupted byits absolute power that it began to unravel itself, and the Church eventuallyfell from its lofty position as civilization’s prime arbiter of truth.A key event in the fall of the Church’s dominion occurred in 1517 when MartinLuther, a German monk and teacher, protested the Church’s sale of indulgences,which were get-out-of-Hell-free passes for the more well-to-do sinners. Luther’schallenge precipitated the Protestant Reformation, and, in its wake, the reachof the infallible Church began to recede. Bolstered by the contributions ofDescartes, Bacon, and Newton, among others, humankind’s evolutionary path beganto move away from its preoccupation with the spiritual realm as science began tounveil the mysteries of the physical Universe. The Reformation marked the first change in direction as the prevailing paradigmbegan to shift back toward the balance point between Spirit and Matter.013 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_013_r1.gif]DEISM: A FLASH OF LIGHTBy the late 17th and 18th centuries, humanity’s evolutionary path was leadingcivilization toward the powerful midpoint where it would reflect a balancebetween spirit and matter. Western civilization was, at the time, experiencingthe Age of Enlightenment, a European intellectual movement that emphasizesreason and individualism rather than monotheistic religious tradition.Enlightenment philosophy acknowledged that God and Nature were one and the sameand that, through a scientific understanding of Nature, people would learn tolive in harmony with God.Interestingly, the balancing of spirit and matter that marked Enlightenmentphilosophy was actually derived from studies of the animistic culture of theAmerican Indians by French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau’sidealized description of the Native Americans as noble savages who symbolizedthe innate goodness of humanity, free from the corrupting influence ofcivilization, launched a wave of European immigration to the newly formedAmerican colonies.Many of the Founding Fathers were deists, practitioners of Enlightenmentphilosophy who accepted the existence of a Supreme Being but rejected belief ina supernatural deity who interacts with humankind. They based their beliefs onwhat they called “natural law and reason.” Like the animists 8,000 years prior,deists honored their relationship, with both the material and nonmaterial realmsof Nature.Steeped in deist philosophy with elements directly derived from Native Americansociety, the U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution represented anexquisite balance between deep spiritual truth and the physical principles of anelegant material Universe. The auspicious event that marked civilization’sreturn to spiritual-material balance was the founding of the United States ofAmerica. The Deistic period marked a brief moment when Spirit and Matter were again inbalanced harmony. This balance didn’t last long, but it did foreshadow that itis possible to reattain evolutionary balance.014 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_014_r1.gif]However, the arrow of time never stands still, so the path of evolutioncontinued, passing through the midpoint as it progressed into the unchartedrealm of matter—away from otherworldliness to this worldliness.As civilization transitioned deeper into the physical realm, science’sintensified exploration of the material Universe resulted in awareness andtechnologies that provided a better physical life than anyone up until that timecould imagine. How does one compare the reported miracle of Jesus turning waterinto wine to the marvels of a steam engine trip to the Orient or a vaccine toprevent the ravages of smallpox? And yet, in spite of all of its technologicalmiracles, modern science during the Age of Enlightenment was not yet in positionto vie for the title of civilization’s “official” truth provider.Simply, science was unable to offer a better truth for our origins than providedby the Bible, which meant that the truths of science played second fiddle to theaccepted truths of the Church.SCIENTIFIC MATERIALISM: MATTER MATTERSMonotheism was based solely on faith. But philosophers and scientists, such asSir Francis Bacon and Sir Isaac Newton, offered humans an opportunity toquestion dogma and seek answers for themselves. For people of that era,scientific truths were predicated on mathematical certainty and predictability,and technological miracles would become the foundation of the new industrialrevolution.Meanwhile, the Church desperately tried to retain control of knowledge,suppressing creative thinkers with the threat of an invitation to the HolyOffice of Inquisition, the consequences of which were an unusually effectiveincentive to help people “think correctly.”The Church also limited the quest for knowledge by making many topics offlimits, discouraging curious budding scientists who wanted to know more aboutthe world. For example, the Church claimed that the human body was a restricteddomain, a “Mystery of God” for His eyes only and to peer inside was a sin.Christians were not allowed to be physicians because of the intellectualprohibition against studying the body’s internal workings. The practice ofmedicine was, therefore, a trade restricted to Jews, Muslims, and those theChurch considered to be non-believers. But, in spite of the Church’s decreesregarding human biology, scientists forged ahead in other fields.Philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes, then later Isaac Newton,postulated that the Universe was a machine. Newton’s principles of mathematicsextrapolated the precision of gears in a clock onto the solar system. While thenew science did not deny that God might have been the original watchmaker, oncethe “world watch” was wound up, it was running pretty well solely onmathematics.In a world where science ruled, God was so far off the planet that His workoperated without him. The subsequent industrial revolution and technologicalinventions further nudged God out of the picture. Who needs God when we humanscan make our own technological miracles? Darwinism marked the prevailing paradigm’s shift into the realm of Matter.015 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_015_r1.gif]It wasn’t until English naturalist Charles Darwin arrived on the scene in themid-19th century that scientific materialism became civilization’s dominantparadigm. Remember, a basal paradigm story has to answer all three perennialquestions. Until Darwin postulated his The Origin of Species , science wasn’table to offer an adequate explanation for the question, “How did we get here?”Darwin’s theory of origins proposed that humans were derived from a primitivelife form through millions of years of hereditary variations shaped by anever-ending struggle to survive. The people of the 19th century readilyaccepted Darwinian theory because they were quite familiar with the consequencesof plant and animal breedingOnce the theory of evolution was accepted as a scientific fact, civilizationquickly dropped the Church as its supreme authority and adopted scientificmaterialism, with its materialist worldview of science, as the “official” truthprovider.Materialists answered the three perennial questions this way:1. How did we get here?Random acts of heredity.2. Why are we here?To go forth and multiply.3. Now that we are here, how do we make the best of it?To live by the law of the jungle.And there we have it—a rapid descent from the laws of Scripture to the law ofthe jungle. With honing, the double-edged sword of materialism has provided uswith comforts of technology that would have been unimaginable to our ancestors;simply put, civilization traded one absolute authority for another. In light ofscience’s perceived miracles, the dogmatic religion of monotheism gave way tothe dogmatic religion of scientific materialism, or scientism. For science, thematerial world is all there is and anything that doesn’t fit into thatideological package is branded as heresy.Like an adolescent asserting independence for the first time, we humans evenbegan to imagine that we could understand the mechanics of a matter-basedUniverse and, hence, unlock all the secrets of life. Civilization’s path hit theextreme deviation toward the material realm in 1953 when molecular biologistsJames Watson and Francis Crick declared they had uncovered the ultimate secretof biology with their discovery of the DNA double helix. In defining the natureof the cell’s genesis elements, Watson and Crick identified the material originsof life. Neo-Darwinism took the prevailing paradigm deep into the realm of Matter.016 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_016_r1.gif]THE TIDE HAS TURNEDWell, what goes up must come down, and we humans have been suffering a“come-downance” ever since. Over the past 50 years, deified technology hasgenerated unimaginable negative reverberations.In Walt Disney’s Fantasia, Mickey Mouse plays the role of the Sorcerer’sApprentice who attempts to re-create the sorcerer’s magic with neither theknowledge nor the wisdom his master possesses. The result is disastrous, asMickey is unable to control the power he has unleashed. Similarly, moderncivilization has activated the power of technology while operating from alimited Mickey Mouse consciousness. Consequently, the same matter-based medicinethat gave us penicillin, the polio vaccine, and open-heart surgery—without thecountervailing understanding of the invisible realm—has become a leading causeof death in Western societies.In a last ditch effort to capitalize on the culture of scientific materialism,venture capitalists convinced scientists and the public to invest in the HumanGenome Project (HGP). This project was designed to identify and patent each ofthe 150,000 genes that neo-Darwinian molecular biologists theorized werenecessary to create a human being.However, the completion of the HGP in 2001 revealed the human genome consists ofonly approximately 23,000 genes. The missing 125,000 genes glaringly reveal thatthe neo-Darwinian belief in a genetically programmed biology is fundamentallyflawed.4 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en37]Creating a health-care system based on this flaw, in conjunction with otherfundamental misperceptions to be described later, has limited advances in healthcare and is directly responsible for allopathic medicine’s decreasedeffectiveness and increased costs. The public’s dissatisfaction with the currentstate of allopathic care is reflected in the fact that nearly half thepopulation of the United States has sought relief through complementary medicinemodalities.Interestingly, most alternative healing practices emphasize the role ofinvisible energy fields in shaping the character of human life. The figure belowshows civilization’s trend away from materialism and toward balance with therealm of invisible sources, the realm of spirit. The Human Genome Project, while still an endeavor of Matter, was a key point inthe prevailing paradigm’s shift back toward the balancepoint.017 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_017_r1.gif]A new science has arisen to replace the erroneous belief that genes are mastersof our fate. The new-edge science of epigenetics recognizes that an organism’sbiology and genetic activity are directly influenced by their interaction withthe environment. Rather than being victims of our genes, epigenetic sciencereveals, that by controlling our environment, we have the power to control ourbiology and become masters of our fate.The good news in the bad news is that society’s evolutionary path is rapidlyreturning to the powerful midpoint and not a moment too soon. Each day reveals anew lesson about how our unbalanced preoccupation with materialism isthreatening life on this planet. Thankfully, we seem to be on a quickeninglearning curve. But if we are to move beyond the unconscious rollercoaster rideof the sine wave, we must become fully conscious and aware that what we need nowis not more spiritual-material polarization, but instead harmonizingintegration.The resurgence of religious fundamentalism, particularly the obsession with therapture and other off-planet rewards, seems to indicate there is a collectiveknowing that we humans are cruising “fool speed ahead” down the road todestruction. Neither the black-cloaked priests nor the white-coated scientistscan help us right now—at least not within the confines of existing beliefsystems. Both monotheism and scientism have essentially disconnected humans fromNature. Religious fundamentalism holds humans above the rest of creation,instead of being part of it. Scientific materialism tells us that the miracle oflife was merely an accident that resulted from a random roll of genetic dice.THE STORY BEHIND THE STORYAre you beginning to see why we need a new story? The old stories keep uspowerless, at the mercy of either a distant God or random genetic events. Theysteal our attention and energy by polarizing the population to adopt untenablepositions rather than enabling us to move forward. Must we deviate once again?Or will we cultivate unity and coherence that will allow us to take an emergentstep forward when, in the near future, the path of evolution once again bringscivilization to the powerful midpoint of balanced spirituality and materiality? With holism, which is the forecasted result of the pending spontaneousevolution,the prevailing paradigm will, once again, be balanced between Spirit and Matter,drawing upon the best and most powerful attributes of each.018 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_018_r1.gif]At a time when persistent archaic patterns are fueling the dueling dualities, itwould be wise to remember what quantum physicists tell us about the nature ofphysical existence: behind every particle, there’s a wave telling the particlewhat to do. Just as animists and deists understood that spirit and matter mustfully coexist, we are being challenged to move past either-or and to recognizeboth-and. It’s like those beer commercials: Great taste and less filling. Spiritand matter. Wave and particle. You and me and all the others, too.Consider the story of life itself. Life came into existence at the midpoint, orzero-point, where both waves of energy and particulate matter were fullypresent. For billions of years, energy from the sun hit the particles of matterthat comprise Mater, our Mother Earth. The energy from those light waves mergedwith Earth’s inorganic chemistry through a process called photosynthesis. Thecomposite of light waves and chemical particles generated organic chemistry, thechemistry of living organisms. Through photosynthesis, the energy of sunlightenlivened inert matter. So life, indeed, began with light from the sky fusingwith the physical matter of Earth! Can you see where Native American animistsgenerated the concept of Father Sky and Mother Earth?In a similar fashion, the sperm cell, which is essentially designed as a meansof delivering genes, carries only information. In that capacity, sperm functionis the equivalent of the wave that fuses with the physical matter in themother’s egg. Once again, in the Universe’s amazing web of integratedself-similar patterns, life is created. From information and matter emerges anew life, something that cannot be predicted by studying the egg and the spermas separate entities. Is it possible that by integrating the opposites of spiritand matter, energy and particle, masculine and feminine, we can create anemergent human society, one never-before seen, whose expression is completelyunpredictable by studying what we have and who we are now?The notion of an emergent humanity may seem like a pie-in-the-sky ideal, butconsider the alternative. We are being forced into a situation wherein we eitherevolve or die. Which would you prefer? And, as we will see in Part II, FourMyth-Perceptions of the Apocalypse, our personal preferences exert a lot morecontrol over our reality than we have, so far, imagined. Consequently, what wechoose to prefer might actually make a difference in the fate of humanity.Unlike our deistic forebears, the battle we face now is not against someexternal king, but rather against our own internal conscious and unconsciouslimitations, against our distorted misperception of human nature and humanpotential. We are at war with the out-picturing of our own fears and habitualdefenses against things that might not even exist anymore. The sad joke is thatmost of us are “remotely controlled” by the beliefs and limitations of peoplewho have lived in the past, and we don’t even know it!When a baby elephant is being trained, its leg is tied to a post with a strongrope. No matter how hard and how long the baby elephant pulls, there is nobudging the post. The elephant ultimately comes to associate the rope with anall-powerful, immovable force. When the elephant becomes an adult, simplyplacing a rope around its leg causes it to stay put because it has alreadyresigned itself to the all-powerfulness of the rope. Even though the adultelephant has the strength to break any rope or uproot nearly any post, thebelief of limitation it acquired from past programming in its youth keeps theelephant immobile and docile.In that light, we might ask: “Which stories and beliefs are keeping usunconsciously tethered, disempowered, and thwarted from expressing our trueabilities? Are we limited by unquestioned beliefs about original sin or themeaninglessness of the Universe? Despite our moral guidance, are we secretlyafraid that maybe might does make right? Have we resigned ourselves to thepervasive belief that there will always be warfare and poverty, and that’s justthe way the world is?”Well, tell that to Mahatma Gandhi. Or Martin Luther King, Jr. Or,better yet, toWashington, Jefferson, and Franklin. Because, as we will see in the nextchapter, the unfinished business of America’s Founding Fathers may very wellhold the key to our next evolutionary stage.Just as they founded the United States of America on what they called “naturallaw,” perhaps what is needed now is an updated natural law through which we liveby our higher nature as cells in the body of Mother Earth and in the spiritenergy of the eternal Universe.That new direction may be our return ticket to the Garden, but this time, wewill return as conscious gardeners, co-creating ever more beautiful, functional,and loving expressions of life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4REDISCOVERING AMERICA“We don’t need a revolution in the United States. We already had one, thank you.What we need now is an American Evolution, where We the People evolve into thecitizens the country’s founders dreamed of.”— Swami BeyondanandaEVOLUTION IN THE PETRI DISHWhen we began to write this book, our original working title was “The AmericanEvolution.” Because we, Bruce and Steve, came from the vastly different domainsof biological science and political science, we each recognized the evolutionarypotential in the political science experiment called the United States ofAmerica. Our nation’s founding slogan e pluribus unum, “out of many, one”,reflects evolutionary science’s new understanding that each of us is aconscious, aware, participating cell in the body of humanity. The scienceexperiment notion makes even more sense when we look at America as a humanculture dish, a macrocosmic science project from which people throughout theworld can learn.From a biological perspective, Earth represents a giant petri dish that supportsthe growth and survival of all the organisms in the biosphere. Oceans, rivers,mountains, and deserts create natural geological boundaries that carve theterrain into specific habitats that are populated with unique and diversecommunities of flora and fauna. The characteristics that define each environmentshape the evolutionary traits of their resident species.The same is true for Earth’s human inhabitants. With the rise of civilization,the environment was further subdivided by geopolitical boundaries thatdelineated states and nations. Citizens contained within national countries orstates were, until recently, walled off from the influence of surroundingtribes. Therefore, each political territory provided a defined environment thatshaped the traits and character of its human inhabitants.Separated by political boundaries, walled-off nations represent the biologicalequivalent of a culture dish that supports the growth and development of itscitizens. Over time, the cultural environments within sovereign petri dishesshape the distinctive customs and traits that define each population’s nationalcharacter.As is evident in any husbandry program, inbreeding can capture and enhance anorganism’s special traits. We see the upside of inbreeding in the amazing numberand variety of cat and dog species that have been created. Unfortunately, thesame breeding practices that create national champions can also createhereditary defects. Inbred genetic disorders can produce degenerative diseasessuch as malformed bones and joints, hemophilia, mental retardation, and a vastarray of other dysfunctions.By the 18th century, cultural inbreeding had defined the unique positive andnegative traits that characterize each of the petri dish nations that compriseWestern civilization. Just as collies and pit bulls express different traits,humans bred in relatively isolated cultures develop cultural personalities.These tendencies have been represented humorously in the joke about Heaven andHell as it relates to the countries in Europe. In Heaven, the police areEnglish, the mechanics are German, the cooks are French, the lovers are Italian,and it’s all run by the Swiss. In Hell, the police are German, the cooks areEnglish, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and it’s all run by theItalians. We laugh in recognition of the differences in these “human breeds.”Something else was true about the human breeding grounds of Europe in the 18thcentury. Citizens within each country were eventually molded into a stratified,caste-like hierarchy of power and position predicated by their family lineage.The rigid nature of a stratified social class essentially defined a citizen’sfuture prospects before they were even born.Consequently, when deistic Enlightenment philosophy swept through Westerncivilization in the 1700s, Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s accounting of the noblesavages’ freedom in the New World inspired visions of unlimited possibilities.Fueled by the dream of unbridled opportunity in the casteless New World, peoplearound the globe sought a better life by immigrating to the fertile environmentoffered in the American colonies.The founding of the United States of America was a grand experiment in theevolution of human civilization. The American colonies were seeded with a widelydiverse population that represented numerous races, creeds, and nationalities.Contained within its geopolitical borders and isolated from Europe and Asia bygreat oceans, the U.S. provided a cultural petri dish to test the dynamics andpotential of a global civilization.Farmers, geneticists, and pet lovers have historically been aware that there isa tendency of crossbred individuals to express qualities superior to those oftheir purebred parents. Scientists refer to this phenomenon as hybrid vigor. Interms of intercultural breeding, the meteoric success of the U.S. to globalsupremacy was a testament to the powers of hybrid vigor.In addition to cultural crossbreeding, the founding of the United States alsocontributed to humankind’s further recognition of the need to balance thespiritual and material realms. The amazing success of the U.S. was due, at leastin part, to the incorporation of these advanced evolutionary principles of anegalitarian civilization, fostered by Enlightenment philosophy, directly intothe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. In doing so, the FoundingFathers put their lives on the line, not for themselves or even the citizens ofthe American colonies. No, they demanded recognition for the value of human lifein a declaration dedicated to all of humanity.Unfortunately, as illustrated by our evolutionary timeline in the previouschapter, the harmony of civilization’s deistic phase represented only a shorttransitional period in humanity’s march into the material realm. In the 1860s,Darwinian theory introduced the world to the notion of a godless, matter-basedexistence. At the same time, the American Civil War and the subsequentindustrial boom ushered in a new, materialist philosophy—one that would lead theUnited States to trade in its deistic spiritual roots and adopt the goldstandard. Along with the worship of money came the rule by the machine.America’s enormous financial success during this period was facilitated by theempowerment of a nonliving entity to make a profit at any cost. In the 1880s,this entity, the corporation, was given the rights of persons but without themoral conscience of a human heart. As is often the case in Nature, an organism,such as an invasive species, arises in the environment in response to animbalance and then becomes the imbalance.Given the corporations’ imperative to grow at any cost, we could argue thatthese once beneficial organisms have become parasites on the body politic, thatthey have over-mined America’s material assets and undermined the moral andspiritual ideals introduced by the Founding Fathers. As we will show in thischapter, the founding vision of the United States was a significant step in theevolution of humanity and has stood as a beacon for the rest of the world—inspite of all the ways the United States has fallen short of that vision.Nonetheless, this grand experiment is far from over. Some would say that in theawakening following the Bush years, there is a rededication to live up to theFounders’ vision. As we emerge from an era of cynicism to one of evolutionarypossibility, we can see how the original intention for the United States hasbeen lost . . . and how it can be discovered once again.AMERICA: REVOLUTION TO DEVOLUTIONAs we explore the rise and fall of paradigms along the path of human evolution,it’s important to remember that history ultimately belongs to those who writeand interpret it and that interpretations tend to correspond with the notions ofthose doing the interpreting. Consequently, we must be aware that, in additionto parts of the story being incorrectly recorded, many interesting and accurateevents are often conveniently omitted because their truth didn’t fit with thestory line that the current “official” truth provider was presenting.Those of us who grew up in the United States probably remember stories of theDeclaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the idealistic principlesthe country was built upon. Stories in elementary school gave the FoundingFathers a supernatural aura, as exemplified by the iconic painting by EmanuelLeutze, Washington Crossing the Delaware, which depicts General GeorgeWashington standing near the bow of a boat while his men row through icy watersof the Delaware River during the Revolutionary War.As befitting their historical contributions, the Founders were initially placedon an iconic pedestal. But within 100 years of putting quill to parchment, theirhalos were tarnished by political strife of the greatest magnitude, the rise ofAmerican industry with its machine mentality, and scathing attacks byinvestigative journalists, writers, and scholarly skep-tics who clearlydemonstrated that all cherished icons and ideals were ripe for deconstruction.Certainly, the Civil War severely eroded America’s innocence. Then, followingthat war, the U.S. economy transformed from agriculture to manufacturing,primarily within the industries of coal, steel, and railroads—all of whichserved to feed the machine. Even urban political organizations, which gave awayThanksgiving turkeys in exchange for votes in the November elections, werecalled machines.In the late 1800s, people enjoyed the simplistic rags-to-riches stories writtenby American author Horatio Alger, which celebrated individuals plucking theplums of success in a competitive world. By the early 1900s, optimism gave wayto books revealing harsh realities; these included The Jungle by Upton Sinclair,an exposé on the horrible conditions in America’s meat packing plants.Muckraking journalists Ida Tarbell, Lincoln Steffens, and others exposed thedarker side of the machine age, including the destructive abuses by corporategiants such as Standard Oil Company. Perhaps the most influential Americanhistorian of the first half of the 20th century was Charles Beard, who,literally and figuratively, came of age during America’s machine age. Writing atthat time of unenlightened self-interest, it’s understandable that Beard wouldlook beneath the halos of the Founding Fathers and find ordinary human beingswith selfish interests much like those of Beard’s contemporaries, thebusinessmen and politicians of the early industrial age.1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en38]Reinforced by the increasing cynicism of the post-modern paradigm, Beard’sdisparaging view of the Founding Fathers took hold and permeated conventionalwisdom. As a result, over the past 50 years, the Founding Fathers have come tobe associated with archconservative Jeffersonian patriots, longing for a lessmeddlesome federal government.At the same time, leftist scholars operating in their own paradigm of politicalcorrectness, saw the Founding Fathers as privileged white men, many of whom wereslaveholders, who sanctioned expropriating the lands of Native peoples. Thesescholarly critics chastised: If the writers of the Bill of Rights were soenlightened, why did they say all men—and not women—were created equal? And whywas the only woman they ever talked about, Betsy Ross, relegated to sewing theflag?Today, we can only imagine Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Hancock, andthe rest of the 56 delegates who signed the Declaration of Independence—many ofwhom were ostracized and suffered financial hardship after assuming their heroicposition—wondering how the ideas for which they risked life and fortune couldhave fallen by the wayside and how their contributions could be dismissed asmere selfishness.THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION WAS NO TEA PARTYThom Hartmann, a contemporary American radio “uncommontator” and author of WhatWould Jefferson Do?, offers a more integrated view and challenges the “elitistwhite guys” label applied to the Founding Fathers by both conservatives andliberals. Hartmann, who called his political perspective “the radical middle,”discovered in his research that the wealthiest of the American revolutionaries,John Hancock, would, at his wealthiest, be worth about $750,000 in today’sdollars. Another of the wealthier signers, Thomas Nelson of Virginia, had hislands and home seized by the British and died penniless at the age of 50.2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en39]And, while educators today would have American youngsters believe that throwingthe British out of the colonies was the thing to do, the revolutionaries were,in actuality, a minority of colonists. As Hartmann wrote: “These men [who signedthe Declaration] were the most idealistic and determined among the colonists.While the conservatives of the day argued that America should remain a colony ofEngland forever, these liberal radicals believed in both individual liberty andsocietal obligations.”3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en40]When they signed the Declaration of Independence, the Founding Fathers weretotally aware that they were signing their own death warrants. When they wrote,“We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, our Sacred Honor,”they understood they were legally marking themselves as traitors—and the penaltyfor treason was death. When Patrick Henry declared, “Give me liberty, or give medeath!” this was no oratorical hyperbole. And when Ben Franklin told his fellowrevolutionaries, “We must all hang together or we shall most assuredly hangseparately,” he, too, was speaking literally.John Hancock, the first to sign the Declaration of Independence and whosesignature looms as the largest by far—“so King George can read it without hisspectacles”—already had a price on his head for sedition. When he and his wifewere forced to flee the British army, their baby died in childbirth.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en41]According to Hartmann, 9 of the 56 signers lost their lives in the war and 17lost their homes and fortunes. He concluded: “While many of the conservativeTory families still have considerable wealth and power (in Canada and England),not a single Founder’s family persists today as a wealthy or politicallydominant entity.”5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en42]With cynicism still the currency of the current political conversation, it’seasy to accept the tired, persistent belief that nothing ever really changesastrue.Yetconsiderthis: a band of mostly young men (Franklinwas,byfar, theoldest at 72, and Jefferson, at 33, was closer to the average age) stood up towhat was then the greatest power in the world, the British Empire. In additionto his military clout, King George III wielded phenomenal economic power overthese revolutionaries because he was also an owner of the largest multinationalcorporation of that time, the East India Company, which was the target of thecelebrated Boston Tea Party.SOVEREIGN EQUALS UNDER NO KINGEven more remarkable than the rebellion—for rebellions had occurred before—werethe evolutionary ideals upon which this revolution was based: “We hold thesetruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowedby their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.” This statement flew in the face ofEuropean law, even at its most enlightened.According to the law of England, God granted kingship to the king who then may,as documented in the Magna Carta, bestow rights on his subjects. This doctrineis classic hierarchy, which places ordinary, non-royal humans squarely at thebottom of the “lowerarchy.” The entire notion that ordinary humans could beequal sovereign citizens who endow government with authority—instead of theother way around—was unheard of. Where did those ideas come from?As we may vaguely remember from high school or college history, those ideas camefrom the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, from philosophers such as John Lockeand Jean-Jacques Rousseau and something called natural law. Under natural law,all human laws are to be judged on the basis of how closely they conform to thelaws of God and Nature.This might seem like something up for interpretation, and it was. Initially, theidea was this: God, and God’s agent, the state, intends for human happiness.Natural law most insures the happiness of most.In his classic work, Leviathan, published in 1651, English philosopher ThomasHobbes attempted to codify this natural law in nine precepts, roughly summarizedhere:6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en43]1. Seek peace first, use war as a last resort.2. Be willing to offer the same freedom to others as to oneself.3. Keep your agreements.4. Practice gratitude.5. Accommodate your own needs to the laws of the community.6. As appropriate, forgive those who repent.7. In the case of revenge, focus not on the great evil of the past but thegreater good to follow.8. Never declare hatred of another.9. Acknowledge the equality of others.John Locke, for his part, sought to hold governments accountable to theseprinciples. In his Two Treatises of Government, which he initially publishedanonymously in 1689, Locke suggested that if a ruler went against these naturallaws and failed to protect “life, liberty and property,” the populace couldjustifiably overthrow the government.7 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en44]Sound familiar? This is the very argument Thomas Jefferson used when he craftedthe Declaration of Independence.GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY ROOTED IN SACRED GROUNDIf we stopped with the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, however, wewould be missing, perhaps, the most important influence on our Founders and thegovernment they created. From where did the European philosophers such as Lockeand Rousseau get their ideas? The answer: from Jefferson’s, Washington’s, andFranklin’s backyard—the New World.While high-minded philosophies of human perfection existed in Europe since theGolden Age of Greece, the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happinessremained an abstract ideal in Socrates’ perfect world of form and never made itinto the crude shadow of reality. Until, that is, the first reports from theAmericas described the ways and customs of its native peoples.While Rousseau’s depiction of the “noble savage” of North America might havebeen over-idealized, it had its basis in reality. As a matter of fact, theconcepts of democracy and balance of powers were alive and well-established atleast 300 or 400 years before the signers of the Declaration lifted a quill!Perhaps as early as A.D. 1100 or, according to some accounts, in the 1400s or1500s, six tribes that populated what is now the northeastern United States,southern Ontario, and Québec, Canada, came together and formed the IroquoisConfederacy.8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en45]The story of the Iroquois Confederacy begins with a seer and great teacher ofmysterious origin, a Native American whose name was The Confluence ofTwo-Rivers. Two-Rivers proposed a League of Peace and Power as a way toestablish tranquility between warring tribes in what is now upstate New York. Hechose a negotiator, Hiawatha, to bring the tribes together. The result was theLeague of Haudenosaunee, the Onondaga word for “People of the Long House.” Theconfederacy was comprised of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Senecatribes, and, later, the Tuscaroras, who migrated from the Carolinas. Throughthis confederacy, six diverse nations found a way to live in relative peace andharmony through a political system that remarkably presaged the United StatesConstitution.9 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en46]Other similarities between the Iroquois Confederacy and the United Statesgovernment are also apparent. As with America’s subsequent federal system, thetribes retained autonomy in regard to local issues. The confederacy was amutual-defense pact, which provided a strong multi-tribe nation to protectagainst outside enemies. It conserved lives, resources, and energies that wouldhave been spent on waging war with each other. Plus, the confederacy employed asophisticated system of checks and balances between three governmental branches.In the Iroquois Nation of colonial America, the Age of Enlightenmentphilosophers of Europe found a real-world object lesson in freedom. As notedhistorian of the Iroquois Nation Donald A. Grinde, a professor of AmericanStudies and a Yamasee Indian, points out, the Iroquois believed in freedom ofexpression, provided that expression caused no harm. Unlike European society,which Grinde called “guilt-oriented” and riddled with copious “thou shalt nots,”tribal culture was “shame-oriented.” That is, a strong identification with thecommunity motivated individuals to avoid transgressions that could bring shameto the clan and to themselves.10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en47]THE “AMERICANIZATION” OF THE WHITE MANThe similarities between Indian governance and the structure of the UnitedStates, no doubt, originated from the profound influence that Native Americanshad on the everyday life of the colonists. This was particularly true for thosewho grew up in the New World rather than England.More so than in Europe, wild nature was everywhere in America and the customs ofdown-to-earth informality and equality naturally pervaded the colonies. AsIndian law scholar Felix Cohen put it, “The real epic of America is the yetunfinished story of the Americanization of the white man.”11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en48]For example, settlers just off the boat from the Old World were surprised tofind colonists dressed in Indian buckskins and shocked to learn that some hadeven adopted indigenous customs—such as bathing! In European society at thetime, bathing was thought to be detrimental to health, so imagine their reactionseeing European-looking folks actually skinny-dipping with the natives.In his boyhood, Thomas Jefferson was deeply influenced by Native Americanculture. His father,Peter Jefferson, was a cartographer who took young Tom onnumerous excursions. A frequent visitor to Jefferson’s childhood home inShadwell, Virginia, was the Cherokee chief Ontasseté. There, young Tom joinedhis father and the chief as they held conversations long into the night.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en49]A Native American from the Iroquois Nation was the first to actually propose thecreation of the United States—on the Fourth of July no less! On July 4, 1744, ata meeting designed to forge an alliance between the Iroquois and the Englishcolonists against the French, a charismatic chief named Canassatego spoke to thecolonists. He said, “Our wise forefathers established union and amity betweenthe Five Nations. This has made us formidable. This has given us great weightand authority with our neighboring nations. We are a powerful Confederacy and,by your observing the same methods our wise forefathers have taken, you willacquire much strength and power; therefore, whatever befalls you, don’t fall outwith one another.”13 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en50]According to Benjamin Franklin, who was present at the meeting, Canassatego alsooffered a powerful demonstration to the colonists. The chief held up an arrowand easily snapped it in two. But when he lashed together twelve arrows—one forevery one of the colonies represented—not even the strongest man in the roomcould break them.14 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en51] Interestingly, theGreat Seal of the United States, designed in 1782 by Charles Thomson, thesecretary of the Continental Congress, and attorney William Barton, shows aneagle clutching thirteen arrows in his claws.Shortly after the meeting with Canassatego, Franklin began his campaign for afederal union. In 1751, he wrote: “It would be a very strange thing if sixnations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming a scheme for such aunion and be able to execute it in such a manner as that it has subsisted ages,and yet a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen Englishcolonies.”15 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en52]Aside from the slam at “ignorant savages,” Franklin deeply respected theIroquois’ political wisdom. Franklin’s Albany Plan of Union, which he presentedto the Albany, New York, Congress in 1754, adopted many features from theIroquois Confederacy, including the principal position of a President-Generalwho would be appointed by the British Crown and colonial delegates.16[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en53]The Albany Plan didn’t pass, but it did serve as a model for the U.S. Articlesof Confederation, which, in 1781, became the first governing document of the newUnited States of America. As a result, the Iroquois Nation was represented bydelegates to the Constitutional Convention, as they well deserved to be.While the Constitutional Convention was convening in Philadelphia, anotherrevolution against a monarchy had erupted in Europe. Using the United StatesDeclaration of Independence as its model, the National Assembly in France drewup its own Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Like the U.S.Declaration, the French document included a statement that underscored basichuman rights.But the French version didn’t take. Perhaps the energy field of Europeanmonarchies was so present and pervasive that even a riled citizenry couldn’tovercome it. However, on the New World side of the Atlantic, where the voice andreach of the British monarchy was fainter and weaker, the revolutionary andevolutionary colonialists established a new republic.AMERICA’S EVOLUTIONARY TRADITIONIn addition to the Native American impact on the formation of the U.S.government, there is another largely untold story about America’s Founders, astory that relates to the very evolutionary threshold we stand upon today.Depending on which axes were being ground, the Founders of the country have beendescribed as scientists or religious men or deists, while, in fact, they wereall three. In his book, America’s Secret Destiny, author Robert Hieronimusprobes deeply into the spiritual lives of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington,and Thomas Jefferson. All three of these American founders were influenced bothby Native Americans who invoked spirit without establishing religion and by themoral and metaphysical ideals of Freemasonry.17[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en54]Many of the nation’s founders were fraternal Freemasons. While the word mason inthe name relates to artisans who craft buildings with stone, the word free is adirect reference to that organization’s ancient founders who were grantedfreedom to travel across national boundaries to build cathedrals and otherbuildings. The Freemasons, whose origins are traced to the secret societies ofthe Knights Templar, are dedicated to the worldly expression of the ideals of“moral renewal and perfection of mankind.”18[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en55]Through harmonious development of their minds, and their hearts. Freemasonspledge to dedicate their lives to unselfish service to mankind. There is nodoubt that our Founding Fathers were affected by special Masonic rituals, whichhistorian Charles Leadbeater described as influencing the energies of the body“so that evolution may be quickened.”19[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en56]Benjamin Franklin was so taken with Freemasonry that, rather than wait until therequired age of 21 to join, he founded his own secret society at age 20. Hecalled his society The Leather Apron Club in reference to the leather apronsworn by masons. He later changed the name to the Junto Club and, finally, theAmerican Philosophical Society. And their credo? Quite simply: “To build aUniverse of peace, devoid of fear and based on love.”20[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en57]Franklin also founded another secret organization in France, the ApollonianSociety, to further his lifelong dream of uniting science with religion. As aMason, he found Masonic doctrine to be virtually indistinguishable from deism,which is the belief in God based on evidence of reason and Nature. He,therefore, referred to God as “the Supreme Architect.”21[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en58]The nature of George Washington’s religious devotion is the subject ofconflicting stories. That’s because Washington was a bridge between deisticpractices of secret societies and religious practices of mainstream religions.As such, he was able to communicate with all his brethren. This is why somereligious sources quote his most pious statements, while free-thinker sourcesdeclare he was never baptized and left churchgoing to his wife, Martha.Nevertheless, Washington gave command only to generals who were Freemasons, andhe adopted the fundamental principles of “the brotherhood of man, and theFatherhood of God.” He spent time in prayer and meditation every day and orderedthat his soldiers say prayers every morning. When no minister was present, hewould often lead Bible readings himself.22[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en59]Thomas Jefferson, while not as overtly religious, wrote the Jefferson Bible andonce said, “I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrinesof Jesus.” Jefferson saw equality as a Biblical and scientific fact, suggestingthat these evolutionary principles be extended to a brotherhood of humanitywhere all humans are created equal.23 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en60]In his inaugural address in 1801, Jefferson declared America as “enlightened bya benign religion, professed in deed, and practiced in various forms, yet all ofthem, including honesty, truth, temperance, and the love of man acknowledgingand adoring an overruling Providence . . .”24[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en61]Even more interesting and pertinent to our time and place today, according toHeironimus, is the theosophical “ye are brethren” traditions of Franklin,Washington, and Jefferson, which hold “. . . that every nation has a spiritualdestiny—using all ethical means of manifesting the divine plan through the willof the nation’s leaders.”25 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en62]Perhaps the destiny of the United States, in regard to living in deistic balancebetween spirit and matter, is to challenge, by example, all nations to findtheir own sacred mission. Doing so involves not only boldly moving forward withnew action but also going back to acknowledge the unacknowledged past.Related to our Native American roots, there are two pieces of unfinished andlargely unacknowledged business. The first is the sad truth of what became ofour spiritual benefactors. The other has to do with a central and key aspect ofNative American culture that even the most enlightened of our Founders couldeven dream of adopting.REPAYING OUR BENEFACTORS: FROM SQUANTO TO TONTOHere is a startling and sobering statistic. According to Donald Grinde, whenChristopher Columbus thought he was the first to discover the New World in 1492,there were at least six million Native Americans living in the territory that isnow the United States. That’s the conservative estimate. Others say there were15 to 20 million. By 1900, the Native American population was only 250,000.26[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en63]Much of this attrition can be attributed to Europeans bringing diseases such assmallpox, measles, and syphilis from crowded European cities—diseases to whichNative Americans had no immunity. However, warfare, forced migration, outrightslaughter, and all of the other fall-out of manifest destiny—a.k.a. manifestedland grab—finished off what the diseases merely began.Grinde points out an obvious relationship between the decimation of the Nativepopulation and the repression of information regarding their contribution to thefounding of the United States. “You can’t justify the whole conquest andsubjugation and destruction of Indian populations if there are things of valuein the people you are destroying,” he wrote.27[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en64]Until 1970, the only thing the general population knew about Native Americanswere fables of Squanto, the Patuxet Indian who helped the pilgrims survive theirfirst difficult years, and the depiction they acquired from radio and TV showslike The Lone Ranger. In other words, awareness ran the gamut from Squanto toTonto.But, in 1970, novelist and historian Dee Brown published Bury My Heart atWounded Knee, an eye-opening history of Native Americans in the west. With thisoutstanding book and a later television film adapted by scriptwriter DanielGiat, American society could no longer deny the genocide and ethnocide wroughtupon the indigenous people by European invaders—er, settlers. In addition, thelid was also lifted on the denial of the contributions Native Americans made.And as we will see shortly, their full contribution has yet to be received.HONORING OUR FOUNDING MOTHERSTo reiterate, perhaps the most important lesson from Iroquois tribal society isthe notion that authority comes from the ground up, not from the top down.Remember, European law, even at its most enlightened, maintained that Goddelegated power to the King who delegated power at his discretion to thenobility, and there it ended. The most radical evolutionary notion of ourFounders—a notion that came directly from Native American culture—is that theneed for government arises from equally sovereign citizens who enter into acompact to ensure a mutually beneficial and thriving community. Again Grinde onNative American society: “Power is breathed into leaders by the people, andthose leaders then exist on that support. When that support no longer exists,then their power ceases to exist.”28 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en65]Although Franklin and others acknowledged the contributions of the IroquoisNation, the one thing they failed to mention—and conspicuously failed to includein America’s constitutional system—was the role of women in the tribe. There wasa reason why Native American society had neither kings nor nobility, the culturewas roughly egalitarian, and resources in the tribe were distributed accordingto need, not social class. And that reason is what came to be called The Councilof Grandmothers.Native American culture perceived Earth, plants, and land as feminine incharacter. Because older women were closest to the basics of life, which had todo with growing and preparing food, birthing and caring for children, and thedomestic work of the community, it was a no-brainer for the men to acknowledgewomen’s fundamental power.The basic unit of government for the Native Americans was the clan, usuallyheaded by an older woman.29 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en66] Clansowned property collectively and used it to grow enough to feed all of theirmembers. Politically, the Iroquois understood the need for women and men toachieve unity and work together in balance and harmony. The older women, theCouncil of Grandmothers, assumed the true political power, possessing soleauthority to choose the chief or impeach a chief for incompetence or wrongdoing.Women even made the final decision regarding whether or not to go to war.Lest we over-glorify the influence of women, Iroquois men sometimes had aproblem with giving women the right to decide when to go to war. Men complainedthat women wanted to take them to war too frequently! Keep in mind that, whilethe Iroquois Confederacy prevented warfare among its confederates, there wereconflicts with tribes outside their nation that often involved abduction ofchildren. Thus, women were eager to avenge those kidnappings. In addition, womenfelt and expressed greater grief over lost husbands and sons, which alsotranslated into calls for vengeance and warfare.30[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en67]When women were past childbearing age, they would become clan mothers; somebecame warriors as well. They would often accompany war parties to make sure themen were doing the proper amount of killing and not shirking their duties. Somereports state that war parties took captives and turned them over to the womento torture. One chief was asked why that was done and he answered, “I do that sothey will grow tired of war.”31 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en68]Interestingly, but not surprisingly, contact with Native cultures actually mayhave sparked the women’s movement in America. Researcher Sally Roesch Wagner,one of the first women to receive a doctorate in women’s studies, reports thatthe founders of the women’s rights movement in the late 19th century, Susan B.Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, among others, had early and influentialcontact with Iroquois women.32 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en69]Stanton reported that, as a young girl of 12 or 13, she visited an Iroquoisreservation. She was surprised to see the mother of her Indian play-mate sellinga horse and accepting cash from a man. Young Elizabeth asked, “What will yourhusband say when he gets home?” The woman replied that the horse was hers, andshe could do with it as she pleased.33 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en70]At a time when women—in what was then known as “civilized culture”—could not ownproperty, this was an eye-opener. In Native American culture, equal rights toproperty for both genders and all classes enhanced freedom and democracy becauseit made it more difficult to bend the will of others through use of economicleverage.As we read these tales of history, as often about ignorance and cruelty as aboutkindness and wisdom, it’s important to step up and view these situationsobjectively from a higher perspective. Instead of blaming dysfunctional or eviltraits on particular peoples, that is, others, it is far more useful andtransformational to recognize these traits as universal human tendencies kept inplace by largely invisible beliefs.As we will see, we hold on to evils in our society by projecting them ontoothers. When we acknowledge and own those evils within ourselves and within ourculture—not out of hatred for our culture but out of love—we stop projectingevil and, in this way, disempower it. This awareness and recognition is thefirst step in awakening consciousness within ourselves and others.UNITING BOTH HEMISPHERES: THE CONDOR AND THE EAGLEThe Native Americans bring us one more gift—this, in the form of a hearteningprophesy from the natives of the Andes. According to their tradition, centuriesago, humans took two diverging paths: the path of the condor and the path of theeagle.The condor path, which has come to represent the peoples of the SouthernHemisphere, is associated with the heart, the intuitive, and the spiritual. Theeagle path, which represents the peoples of the Northern Hemisphere, isassociated with the brain, the rational, and the material. For the past 500years, the power of the eagle—mental and materialistic—has dominated that of thecondor’s spirituality and heart-centeredness. But according to the prophecy,this is about to change.The indigenous tradition among the peoples of the South has divided time intoepochs called pachacutis, each spanning roughly 500 years. According to theAztec Calendar—a.k.a. The Sacred Stone Calendar of the Mexican People—the FourthPachacuti that began in 1492 was characterized by the prophecies as a time ofturmoil, struggle, and conflict. Since October 12, 1992, we’ve been in the FifthPachacuti, which is said to be a time of partnership and union, where eagle andcondor “fly together in the sky as equals.”34[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en71]And not a moment too soon. In our evolutionary journey through basal paradigmsthat have taken us deep into the realms of spirituality and materialism overthese many centuries, the one thing these paradigms had in common was theirdisconnection from the sacred feminine and, consequently, from Earth itself. Aswe will expand upon later, the very detachment and denial of the feminine inWestern society has put us out of touch with the natural world. For centuries,the powers of unbalanced domination, empowered first by a He-God then by aHe-Science, have forced our world further and further out of kilter to where weare on the brink of destroying the very ground upon which we stand.Now, in its infinite sense of humor, the Universe is finally asking us toreconcile the hemispheres, left and right, north and south. This time ofspiritual reunion, when we will link the sacred masculine and sacred feminine,is not merely the province of indigenous spirituality or reconstituted goddessworship.The Dalai Lama has also spoken of it. He says he will be the last Dalai Lamafrom the Himalayas, and the next one will likely be from the other highmountains, the Andes. Meanwhile, many international organizations have bandedtogether under the banner of the Pachamama Alliance to foster this emergenthuman culture by helping the people of the condor and the people of the eagleshare their gifts with one another.While the people of the condor live simply, with relatively small means, theirlives are rich in joyful relationships and wisdom that comes from connectingwith Nature. Confronted by the forces of development and civilization, thepeople of the condor must learn to choose carefully which of these gifts theyaccept and which they turn down.The people of the eagle are often materially rich yet spiritually impoverished.Wealth and possessions seem to have distorted life and diminished community.This imbalance is particularly intense in the United States where citizens failto notice a gluttonous absurdity. With a mere 5 percent of the world’spopulation, the U.S. consumes a whopping 30 percent of the world’s resources andthen spends $35 billion a year trying to lose weight.35[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en72]In order to confront the serious insanity in which we currently reside, we mustexamine and reconsider the invisible beliefs with which we have been programmed.Psychologist James Hillman suggests “northern thinkers” who value the linear andthe intellectual must “go south” and release themselves from the confinement offamiliar “psychological territory.”36 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en73]In Part II, Four Myth-Perceptions of the Apocalypse, we will see how WesternCivilization has paradoxically gone south by adhering to the northern values ofscientific materialism. We will examine the consequences of fourmyth-perceptions that challenge civilization’s survival and are forcinghumankind to evolve through a reconciliation of the hemispheres. In the words ofactivist and author John Perkins, “If the condor and eagle accept thisopportunity, they will create a most remarkable offspring, unlike any seenbefore.”37 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en74]"},{"pageContent":"PART IIFOUR MYTH-PERCEPTIONS OF THE APOCALYPSE“When you find yourself on a vicious cycle, for goodness sakes, stop peddling!”— Swami Beyondananda We have seen how perceptions impact our biology and, in turn, help create ourreality. We have also seen that our story—the philosophical lens of perceptionthrough which we see and understand the world—largely determines the parametersof our collective reality. Our review of history reveals that civilizationscontinuously evolve as one basal paradigm story gives way to another in adynamic, spiral dance.Civilization is, indeed, in a spiral dance, but we seem to be spiraling out ofcontrol. Global crises and mounting chaos signal an impending evolutionaryturning point, a sign that we are close to the next paradigmatic hand-off. Nowthat we have fully experienced the polarity of scientific materialism, our pathis rapidly approaching its return to the powerful midpoint—the most powerfulpoint in the chart.Twice before, we have been at the midpoint where the spiritual and materialworlds are one. The first time was in the Garden when our animistic worldviewmade no distinction between spirit and matter. That was before we left on ourgreat learning adventure.On the first leg of our evolutionary journey, civilization traversed a path thatwent deep into the nonmaterial domain of an off-planet God. After completing ourexploration of the spiritual realm, humanity’s path momentarily passed throughthe midpoint again as its journey proceeded into the domain of materialism. Thatwas the time when people of the Age of Enlightenment and deistic philosophyembraced both spiritual and material philosophy. The Declaration of Independenceis a perfect example of blending spiritual idealism and practical realism.However, civilization’s flirtation with balance was fleeting because humanitywas rushing headlong into the polar realm of scientific materialism.Civilization’s forays into the polarities of spiritualism and materialism haveprovided us with deep insights into the nature of reality. And, now, as ourevolutionary path is once again returning us to the midpoint, humanity is at acrossroads, confronted with two fundamental paths. We can either unite as aglobal community to assimilate and integrate our polarized insights, thus makinga quantum evolutionary jump, or we can continue the bipolar insanity asreligious and scientific materialist fundamentalists duke it out to be the lastparadigm standing on a dying planet.Whether or not we make this quantum leap depends upon how well we learn thelessons of the current and the previous paradigms. If we understand thatevolution is the progression of accumulated awareness, then, perhaps, if wefocus our collective awareness, we might just speed up the evolutionary process.UNVEILING THE OLD, REVEALING THE NEWIn Part II, we take a close-up view of the life-threatening consequences ofscientific materialism, our current basal paradigm. We specifically focus onfour cultural beliefs that form the cornerstones of our current reality eventhough contemporary science has found each of them to be flawed, if notdownright false. We present these beliefs as the Four Myth-Perceptions of theApocalypse in reference to where we are likely headed if we keep going where weare going.Modern society’s faith in or worship of the material realm has us hurtling downthe track to a train wreck of Earth-shattering proportions. Continued economicgrowth from accelerated extraction of natural wealth is not sustainable.Treating the land as landfill and our air, water, and soil as final restingplaces for pollutants is suicidal. Warfare, as a method of problem solving, hasactually taken us to the brink of the ultimate solution to the human problem: nohumans, no problem.Clearly, the current paradigm of scientific materialism is not up to theevolutionary task at hand. Nor can going back to religious monotheism, the priorparadigm, take us forward, either. We seem to be at a life-threatening impassein the face of ominous apocalyptic predictions. The key to avoiding apocalypticcollapse, however, lies in appreciating the meaning of the wordapocalypse—before it became a code word for “the end of the world.”Originally, apocalypse meant a prophetic revelation, “a lifting of the veils.”It represented the exposure of something hidden and has, since the time of theGreeks, been associated with revelations that would occur at the end of time. Anew—or, actually, old—interpretation of the word suggests that, by lifting theveil on our own invisible programming, we might yet avoid the inevitable trainwreck that awaits us if we stay on the current track.Scientific materialism has offered four tenets in the dominant basal paradigmthat, until recently, have been accepted and regarded as indisputable scientificfact:1. Only Matter Matters—the physical world we see is all there is.2. Survival of the Fittest—Nature favors the strongest individuals, and the Lawof the Jungle is the only real natural law.3. It’s in Your Genes—we are victims of our biological inheritance and the bestwe can hope is that science finds ways to compensate for our inherent flaws andfrailties.4. Evolution Is Random—life is basically random and purposeless, and we got herepretty much the same way as an infinite number of monkeys pecking on an infinitenumber of typewriters over an infinite amount of time might produce the works ofShakespeare.In the next four chapters, we trace the development of each of these tenets fromtheir origins as myth-perceptions through the profound revisions offered bycurrent science.In Chapter 9, Dysfunction at the Junction, we will examine the consequences oftaking each of these beliefs to its logical illogical conclusion. Theinstitutions we examine—economics, politics, health care, and communications—allsuffer from the same fatal affliction: they have pursued scientific materialismto the point of distortion and made money, materialism, and machinery moreimportant and more valuable than human life.Then in Chapter 10, Going Sane, we explore how we can make sane choices thatwill transform us from our current role as children of God to adults of God.We’ll see how we can synergistically learn from where we’ve been on thisevolutionary path and, thus, become willing participants in our reconnectionwith each other, with Nature, and with the divine in all. We’ll learn how toembrace our untapped power—and to do so with kind, benign humility.This examination of current situations and future possibilities is necessarybecause, if we look at the world with clarity, loving compassion, and evenhumor, we stand a chance of breaking free from this trance and achievingspontaneous evolution. Perhaps the most appropriate lens to use when looking atwhere civilization now stands is an entertainment genre that wouldn’t exist wereit not for our worship of all things scientific: science fiction. As an example,consider the movie The Matrix.In a scenario set in the near future, a young computer hacker named Neo findshimself in two parallel worlds. One world, the Matrix, seems to be thereality-as-usual world of everyday life in the Cyber Age. The other world is theworld-behind-the-world where he discovers machine-like humanoids that keepliving and breathing humans happily distracted while exploiting them aspower-sources for the humanoids’ machinery. The vast majority of humans in Neo’sworld, knowingly or unknowingly, have taken the blue pill of blissful or, atleast, passive ignorance. Neo and his compatriots, Morpheus and Trinity, havetaken the red pill, which is the much more dangerous path of awakening throughwhich they step outside the Matrix.Awakening to what? As Morpheus told Neo, “The Matrix is a computer-generateddream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being intothis.” And Morpheus shows him a copper-topped battery. Considering that sciencefiction is often a predecessor for science fact—think of submarines in JulesVerne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea—we might do well to step outsidethe matrix of life and be curious about the world that has been spun out beforeus.As we will see in our discussion of “weapons of mass-distraction,” most peoplehave chosen the blue pill and have signed off on reality in favor of reality TV.However, every day, increasing numbers are opting for the red pill and areawakening to a world of awesome wonder and overwhelming confusion.The confusion is clarified the moment we realize that much of what we perceiveas natural human behavior is actually the consequence of developmentalprogramming. In Part II, we describe how we came to accept beliefs that madesense once upon a time but are now contributing to the destruction of our world.With nobody telling us what else to do in the face of these crises, ourprogramming has us feeling helpless in a situation that seems hopeless.The real issue we must come to terms with is that, for millennia, we have beenprogrammed to be powerless and, consequently, dependent upon others for oursurvival, especially in the areas of spirituality and health. Of course, feeswere involved, and this exchange has significantly contributed to our currentglobal crises. Yet there is an easy way out of our self-imposed matrix: we cansimply reprogram our lives. By acquiring and acting upon new awareness, weafford ourselves an opportunity to rewrite the programs of cultural limitations.The first step in reprogramming is deprogramming. We do this by examining theprogram from outside the matrix. How? In his book, The Power of Now, EckhartTolle describes a time in his life when he was going through such despair andtorment that he considered suicide. Then, a wild thought came to him: “Exactlywho is the ‘who’ who wants to do away with whom?” With this epiphany, Tollerealized that he was also the observer outside the matrix, beyond the world ofcircumstance; this liberated him from attachment to the who whom he thought hewas.1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en75]Quantum physicists tell us that our observations change reality. If this isindeed the case, the insights we offer regarding the four apocalypticmyth-perceptions and the human and societal dysfunctions they spawn should helpyou, and all of us, change the way we observe the world. Hopefully, that willenable us to awaken our collective consciousness and change our collectivereality, as well."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5MYTH-PERCEPTION ONE: ONLY MATTER MATTERS“It is said that invisible forces control our world, but personally I just can’tsee it.”— Swami BeyondanandaIS SCIENCE A RELIGION?Monotheism became Western civilization’s basal paradigm during the Dark Ageswhen it offered the best and most acceptable answers to the three perennialquestions.1. How did we get here?2. Why are we here?3. Now that we’re here, how do we make best of it?By replacing the former paradigm of polytheism, the Church positioned itself asthe sole fount of civilization’s knowledge. As the primary provider of masseducation, the Church used its power of controlling knowledge to amass vastwealth and great influence. Meanwhile, as the self-proclaimed intercessorbetween God and king, it enlisted the mighty arm of the law to forcibly secureits dominion.Over time and intoxicated with authority, the Church’s original mission ofhelping humanity took a back seat to the more pressing mission of helpingitself. Yet its power rested precariously upon the fragile foundation that itsknowledge represented absolute truth.But let’s be realistic. No authority, especially one predicated on staticancient knowledge, can support that claim. So, in time, Church theologians facedthe inevitable likelihood that others would arrive at truths that differed fromtheir own.Enter the Inquisition, through which the Church’s mafia made challengers of thefaith an offer they couldn’t refuse: lose that thought or lose your life. Thosewhose views conflicted with Church dogma were subject to imprisonment andtorture with the sentence dutifully executed—pun intended—by civil authorities.The oppressive leadership of the Church was finally challenged by Renaissancescientists who came on the scene like a breath of fresh air. With a liberatingand more humane, sane view of knowledge, scientists promised to keep an openmind and apply an apparently unbiased eye regarding truths.However, over time, after science had solidified its position as civilization’s“official” truth provider, practitioners of that paradigm also began tooppressively profess and defend its truths as absolute and infallible.Subsequently, in the modern world, the term scientific is synonymous with true.In contrast, a belief designated as unscientific becomes, at best, questionableand, at worst, illegal and punishable, again, by civil law.Cloaking its authority in the guise of “We know what’s best for you,” scientificauthorities have carried out their own witch-hunts of those deemed guilty ofscientific heresy. Chiropractors, energy healers, midwives, and others whosemodalities often fall outside of and challenge mainstream scientific thinkinghave been hounded, abused, and jailed for their “unscientific” beliefs andpractices.Even civilians who decide not to follow scientific norms are subject to arrestand conviction. For example, the courts have taken custody of children withcancer and other diseases after their parents refused to follow traditionaltherapies, even though the medical therapies offered no better resolutions thanalternative methods of treatment.In 2004, doctors determined that Amber Marlowe’s baby was too large to deliverby natural childbirth and that she would be required to have a caesarian birth.When she balked, medical authorities at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital obtained acourt order to force Marlowe into surgery under threat of arrest for“endangering the life of a child.” Fortunately, this story had a happy ending.According to a news article, “Marlowe escaped from the hospital and had a quick,natural birth at a different facility.”1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en76]Is modern science the infallible source of absolute knowledge it now claims tobe? Absolutely not!But here’s the good news. The spirit of science is alive and well. Pioneersthinking outside the box are now precipitating upheavals at the leading edge ofscience, and their new thoughts are radically rewriting the way we see life.With the revolution underway, the old guard, defending the institution of oldscience, has dug in to defend its territory. By preserving and protecting itscherished, yet obsolete dogma, the scientific establishment—or, more accurately,those that profit from science, for example, the pharmaceutical industry—haveslipped into the realm of religion by touting the dogma: “It’s true because wesay it is!”As we will see, however, when we follow Newtonian linear logic to its illogicalconclusion and declare that only matter matters, we end up excluding the entiredimension of the unseen realm. And that’s the reality we are beginning torealize may be of greatest importance in regard to the nature and mechanics ofthe Universe. Meanwhile, leaders of the new science have nailed their theses tothe door of the Church of Scientific Materialism. Let the re-formation begin!A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO ABSOLUTE CERTAINTYThe film Quest for Fire provides a keen insight into the world of prehistorichuman civilizations. By using fire as a tool for survival, ancient humans wereable to protect themselves from carnivorous predators and, in the process, takea huge step toward mastering their environment. While early humans could managefire, they were unable to create it. These tribes spent a great deal ofcollective energy maintaining their flame even as they traveled. If a tribe lostits fire, it would quickly devolve to the status of prey, ever vigilant of thecircling predators in the dark.In the movie’s final scene, our prehistoric hero learns how to make fire. Thefilm’s portrayal of this emotionally charged event brilliantly captures one ofthe pivotal moments in our evolution. Up to that point, human awareness waspreoccupied with immediate survival in a world dominated by voracious predators.By mastering fire, humans were no longer just another animal; they were on theirway to becoming the dominant force in the biosphere. The film ends with thetribe safely sitting around the fire pit and our protagonist gazing skyward,contemplating the full moon. With primary survival assured, humankind was freeto reflect on the nature of the world.From these humble beginnings, the endeavor of science ultimately evolved toformally explore, classify, and understand how our world works. In Westerncivilization, conventional science officially arose in the Golden Age of Greecewhen philosophers, such as Aristotle, collected observations and insights abouttheir world and integrated them with conclusions derived from simpleexperiments.As Christian monotheism took hold of Western civilization’s basal paradigm, itcarried forth and incorporated ancient Greek science into its mix of worldknowledge. Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus modified and adapted Grecianscientific philosophy to accommodate and support the tenets of Christianscripture. The new Church-based science, known as Natural Theology, formalizedthe way that science would perceive and study God’s creation. In this supportivecapacity, science obediently took its place as the Church’s handmaiden.As described earlier, when science was called in to resolve the Church’scalendar conundrum, the seeds of a paradigmatic revolution were set. Copernicus’discovery that the solar system is heliocentric was the birth of modern scienceas a formal institution, separate and distinct from the Church. Andpronouncement of that discovery marked a turning point that would lead to morechallenges regarding the Church’s infallibility and, ultimately, to the collapseof the monotheistic paradigm.The year 1543 is considered to be the advent of the modern scientificrevolution. It was the year that Copernicus, at the end of his life, publishedhis book De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolutions of the HeavenlySpheres) and successfully challenged the Church’s claim of infallibility.One of the first issues that modern science had to wrestle with was simply,“What is a truth?” Remember, the science of the 16th century was a collection ofancient speculations that had been passed down from the Greeks and modified byChristian theologians. Science was confounded by the fact that there was no wayto distinguish or validate a real truth from a fervently held belief.Consequently, the first task of modern science was to create a scientific methodfor assessing data. Essentially, the scientific method involves makingobservations and measurements, creating explanatory hypotheses, and conductingexperiments designed to test the hypotheses. The results of the experiments arethen used to refine the hypotheses so they become more predictive of theexperimental results. In the end, predictability is the primary hallmark of ascientific truth.Rene Descartes further advanced the new paradigm by calling for completescientific reform. He boldly suggested throwing out the existing ancient Greekbeliefs and replacing them with verifiable truths, subjected to Francis Bacon’sanalytical scientific methodology. “Doubt everything,” said Descartes, and,indeed, the only thing he knew that was undoubtedly true was his own existence.“I think, therefore I am,” Descartes said famously. Perhaps, as we will seeshortly, the Universe is capable of making the same claim.The scientific method requires that direct observations and measurements be madeon the subject of study. In the absence of today’s technology, early scientistswere restricted to studying only things they could see, touch, and measure. Theconcept of an invisible energy matrix—which modern quantum physicists named “thefield” and which Einstein later attributed as “the sole governing agency ofmatter”—was clearly not accessible to scientific observation at the time ofNewton and Descartes.Consequently, the parameters of the scientific method unavoidably limitedscience to studies of the physical, material world. By narrowing its focus ofstudy and determining that nonmaterial concepts, such as spirit and mind, wereoutside the box of analytical science, science officially acquired the status ofscientific materialism. As a result, science considered such elements of theinvisible realm to be metaphysical notions, which were happily left to theChurch and were not subjected to the rigid laws of physical science.By detaching from the beliefs of the Church and narrowing their observations tothe physical, tangible Universe, scientists initiated a new philosophy. Ratherthan viewing the Universe as controlled by spiritual forces, scientists pursuedthe notion that the Universe was a physical machine. To them, the planets,stars, plants, and animals were merely mechanical gears in a giant clockworkmechanism.While scientists supported the notion that God created the machine, they alsobelieved that once the machine was set in motion, God was no longer personallyinvolved in its day-to-day operation. Rather than imagining God hovering abovethe world and controlling it like a marionette with spiritual strings, scienceperceived the Universe as a perpetual motion machine that reflected the behaviorof its mechanical parts.Sir Isaac Newton used mathematics to scientifically verify and solidifyDescartes’ premise that the Universe is a machine. By observing and measuringplanetary bodies, Newton generated a new philosophy regarding how theUniverse—and life in general—works. Newton officially founded the science ofmechanics, also known as physics, which is the discipline that studies themechanisms that underlie the operation of the Universe.Newton’s science was based upon two absolutes: absolute space and absolute time.In a quantifiable Universe, as he defined it, objects move through theseabsolutes because of gravity. While gravity is an invisible force, Newtonrecognized it by its fruits, specifically, a falling apple. As materialists,Newtonian followers were undaunted by gravity’s invisible character. They simplyascribed gravity as being caused by a combination of matter and a gaseoussubstance they called “ether.” They, therefore, perceived gravity as anattribute of the mass of the object.Since the 1700s, three main tenets of Newtonian philosophy have shaped howscientists approach their study of the Universe:1. Materialism—Physical matter is the only fundamental reality. The Universe canbe understood through knowledge of its visible physical parts. Rather thaninvoking unseen vital forces or spirits, life is derived from self-reactivechemistry that comprises the body. Simply stated: “All that matters is matter.”2. Reductionism—No matter how complex something appears, it can always bedissected and understood by studying its individual components. Simply stated:“To understand something, take it apart and study its pieces.”3. Determinism—Occurrences in Nature are causally determined, a consequence ofthe concept that every action produces a reaction. An outcome can be predictedby the linear progression of discrete events. Simply stated: “We can predict andcontrol the outcome of natural processes.”Newtonian materialism, reductionism, and determinism offered not merely ananalysis of the Universe but also the promise of a controllable utopia. Theprice? The thinking world would have to sacrifice its preoccupation with God,spirits, and invisible forces.Somewhere between the time of Newton in the early 1700s and the Age ofEnlightenment in the late 1700s, tensions eased between the upstart paradigm ofmodern science and the still-dominant, Church-controlled monotheistic paradigm.By conveniently dividing the Universe into a material realm and a spiritualrealm, science ruled the physical world and religion took dominion over themetaphysical world.Therefore, science was free to pursue its proof of the material nature of theUniverse, and religion still guided the course of transcendent souls. While thatwas a convenient truce between two intellectual superpowers, the resultingseparation of spirit from matter has led to an imbalance that continues toendanger our world today.As the 19th century neared a close, the entire material Universe restedcomfortably on a foundation of irrefutable Newtonian truth. Science hadpresumably proved that the Universe was a physical machine made out of elementalparticles called atoms and that universal dynamics could be understood anddetermined by studying billiard ball-like atomic actions and reactions. In fact,by the end of the 19th century, physicists were so pleased with themselves, theypublicly acknowledged that the science of physics was complete and there wasnothing more to learn.William Thomson, renowned as Lord Kelvin, was an Irish mathematical physicistand engineer who addressed an assemblage of physicists at the BritishAssociation for the Advancement of Science in 1900 and stated, “There is nothingnew to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precisemeasurement.”2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77] A similar statement isattributed to Albert Michelson, the first American physicist to receive a NobelPrize. Newtonian science had appeared to be so complete that, as chairman ofphysics at the University of Chicago, Michelson quipped that no more physicsgraduate students were necessary because, as he said, “the grand underlyingprinciples have been firmly established . . . further truths of physics are tobe looked for in the sixth place of decimals.”3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en78]But a funny thing happened on the way to absolute certainty. Demonstrating onceagain that pride goeth before the fall, unanticipated anomalies began to turnthe world of Newtonian physics upside down. The first crack in the mechanicalworldview came in 1895 with investigations by German physicist Wilhelm ConradRoentgen of x-rays, which demonstrated the existence of a mysterious force thatemanates from matter and penetrates other matter. Subsequently, Frenchphysicists Antone Becqueral and then Marie and Pierre Curie discovered thephenomenon of radioactivity, which revealed that atomic elements are notimmutable as presumed but that fundamental elements could, in fact, transmuteinto other elements.Two years later, British physicist Sir Joseph John Thomson detected electrons,which demonstrated that the atom isn’t the Universe’s smallest particle, asNewtonian physics had claimed, but is comprised of even smaller subunits.While studying the spectrum of light emitted by heated elements, Germanphysicist Max Planck discovered that electrons could jump from one energy shellof the atom to another shell, going instantaneously from one energy level toanother without expressing intermediate energy values. Consequently, Planckrecognized that the electrons were made up of discrete units of radiant energy,which he described as quanta. His work revealed that as electrons jump betweenenergy shells they either gain or lose a quantum of energy, hence the origins ofthe science of quantum physics.In 1905, studies on the photoelectric effect by German physicist Albert Einsteinshowed that nonmaterial light waves expressed physical characteristics that wereformerly attributed only to matter. Based on his observations, Einsteinpostulated the existence of photons, which are quanta of radiant light energyexpressing particulate qualities. With matter behaving as light and lightbehaving as matter, the certainties of Newtonian physics suddenly seemeduncertain.In 1926, French physicist Louis-Victor de Broglie predicted that all particlesof matter should also behave as nonmaterial waves, and his de Broglie Hypothesiswas confirmed three years later in studies on electrons. These experimentsshowed that electrons have both wavelike properties and particle properties;that is, they are simultaneously material and nonmaterial.With these discoveries, within a mere quarter century after Thomson’s andMichelson’s statements about the definitive end of physics, the solid foundationof Newtonian physics had seemingly dissolved into a Zen-like paradox.The particle-versus-wave confusion was eventually resolved with the advent andestablishment of quantum mechanics. The wave-particle duality, a hallmark ofquantum physics, provided a single unified theoretical framework forunderstanding that all matter has characteristics associated with both particlesand waves. Welcome to the world of quantum weirdness!Einstein’s mass-energy equation (often symbolized with the equation E=mc2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77]) acknowledges the unification ofenergy and matter, wherein energy (E) equals mass (m) times the speed of light(c), squared. With this, Einstein showed that atoms are actually not made out ofmatter, but consist of nonmaterial energy! Today, it is fully established thatphysical atoms are comprised of a menagerie of subatomic units such as quarks,bosons, and fermions. Interestingly, particle physicists perceive of thesefundamental atomic units as vortices of energy resembling nanotornados .In other words, the long-held perception of a Newtonian Universe, madeexclusively of physical objects, turns out to be an elaborate illusion! Incontrast, Einstein’s unified theory, which attempts to explain the nature andbehavior of all matter and energy, proposed that the Universe is one indivisibledynamic whole wherein all physical parts and energy fields are entangled andinterdependent.While quantum mechanics undermined science’s preoccupation with materialism,Planck’s work also questioned the emphasis on reductionism, which focuses onindividual parts rather than the whole. While reductionism appears to explainsimple mechanical processes, Planck demonstrated that some events cannot bepredicted by linear cause-and-effect reactions but seem to occur simultaneouslyas part of an interacting energy matrix called the field. Planck’s insightsemphasized that, in order to understand the nature of the Universe, we mustabandon reductionism and, instead, turn to holism, wherein everything interactswith everything else.Interestingly, the classic analogy used to describe reductionism involved takingapart a wind-up watch to see what makes it tick. By observing the interaction ofmechanical gears and springs, one would presumably be able to repair or alterthe mechanism of any other watch. Similarly, scientists presumed that, in orderto determine what makes a living organism tick, they could simply take a bodyapart and study its pieces.Fortunately for us, both reductionism and the watch analogy are now completelyout of vogue. Consider the digital watch. Take it apart, examine its components,and . . . what?Digital watches involve technology derived from quantum mechanics and operate byenergy movement, not through interaction of physical gears. Disassembling adigital watch and examining the organization of its bits and pieces will neverreveal the nature of its operation. The pursuit of reductionism, with its focuson individual material parts, simply does not offer insight into the integratedmechanics of an entangled quantum Universe.In addition to challenging our fixation on materialism and reductionism, thescience of quantum physics also dispenses with the notion of determinism, whichis the doctrine that all events, including human choices and decisions, arepredicated on a specific sequence of causal reactions that adhere to naturallaw. Simply stated, determinism proposed that, with enough data, we can predictthe future.However, Werner Heisenberg, a German physicist and one of the founders ofquantum mechanics, discovered that it was not possible to simultaneously mapboth the position and the velocity of an atom’s electron. The more accuratelyits position is measured, the more uncertain the value of its velocity becomes,and vice versa.Heisenberg’s theory of uncertainty applies to any two conjugate variables, suchas position and velocity, time and energy, or angle of rotation and angularmomentum. The theory implies that the measurement of one variable results in thedisturbance of its conjugate partner, so that both variables never accurately bepredicted at the same time. Not only is Heisenberg’s theory a direct affront todeterminism, it also suggests that the existence of matter is, itself, anuncertainty.Please note that the adoption of quantum mechanics does not negate Newtonianphysics, but, rather, subsumes it. In other words, quantum physics is a largerrealm of awareness that includes and substantially adds to the informationprovided by Newtonian physics. Consequently, quantum mechanics accounts for whatwas already known plus a whole new realm of heretofore-unrecognized forces thatcontrol the unfolding of our Universe.Quantum mechanics emphasizes that the material Universe—with all of its atoms,particles, and matter—is actually a component of, and controlled by, theinvisible universal matrix of energy forces that collectively comprise thefield.Perhaps you recall an elementary school experiment that involves a magnet, apiece of paper, and iron filings. When you sprinkled iron filings onto a pieceof paper, the particles distributed themselves in a random manner. However, ifyou placed a magnet beneath the paper, the sprinkled filings always arrangedthemselves in a defined pattern that reflected the shape of the invisiblemagnetic field; the filings did this every time, regardless of how many timesyou repeated the process.Now, imagine trying to explain the phenomenon of how the pattern is formedwithout knowledge of the magnet or the role of invisible fields. What kind ofconclusion would you draw if you could see only the iron filings? You couldeasily conclude that those iron filings, those physical objects, are trulyamazing—they filed themselves!This is the predicament we find ourselves in if we try to make sense of ourworld by only focusing on the material realm. It is a particularly egregiouserror in the Universe where we now understand that the invisible field is theagency that governs matter. Or, as Einstein stated with inimitable simplicity:“The field is the sole governing agency of the particle.” What Einstein meantwas that the field is the Universe’s energy matrix that governs all matter,including those mysterious iron filings.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en79] Einstein further emphasized thefield’s role in shaping the Universe when he said, “There is no place in thisnew kind of physics both for the field and matter, for the field is the onlyreality.”5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en80]A century after Einstein presented his mass-energy equation E=mc2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77], and the belief that matter and energyare inherently interrelated and entangled, many people tenaciously hang onto theillusion of a material-based reality. The insanity we see around us, providedwe’re not so caught up in it ourselves that we don’t notice, is a byproduct oftrying to live Newtonian existence in an Einsteinian world.Interestingly, the invisible energy field that shapes matter, as defined byquantum physicists, has the same characteristics as the invisible shaping fieldsthat metaphysicians define as “spirit.”WHAT IF JESUS AND EINSTEIN WERE BOTH RIGHT?If you’re puzzled by the fact that science has ignored Einstein for one hundredyears, it should be even more puzzling that society has ignored Jesus for twomillennia.When we consider the messages of both Jesus and Einstein together, we can assigna possible scientific basis for the Golden Rule. Along the same line, Jesus’prescription to “love thy neighbor as thyself” makes perfect sense in anEinsteinian world where thy neighbor is thy self. The bottom line implication ofthe theory of relativity is . . . we’re all related.While scientifically advanced nations have had no problem using quantum physicsto develop atomic power and nuclear destruction, when it comes to understandingthe everyday world, many are still blind to the invisible realm. For example, inthe domain of politics and diplomacy, governments still operate in a Newtonianworld comprised of individualized interacting parts and pieces, labeled asnations, governments, departments, or territories.Instead of focusing on the cooperative nature of the energy field and naturalresources that we all share, the emphasis is on a competitive war-basedpolitical system that intensifies separation and divisiveness, borders andbarriers, us and them. The same Newtonian action-reaction mechanics uphold ajustice system that emphasizes punishment. “An eye for an eye” is clearly a veryNewtonian principle that will make the whole world blind.We hold nothing personal against Isaac Newton, whose genius will be rightlycelebrated as long as there is human history. Newton’s science provided humanitywith a technical foundation that enabled civilization to gain some control overits external environment. And much of the improvement in the physical conditionsof humankind must be attributed to Newtonian science staking its own claimoutside of religious dogma. However, society must now deal with the horrors andinsanities wrought by a physical science that is unglued from the invisibleworld.To see what happens when only matter matters, all we have to do is look atWestern society and the monster stepchild it spawned: globalization . In aFrankensteinian sense, humanity has created and released into the world a purelymaterialistic, mechanical, and nonliving entity known as the corporation. Notonly have we given life to the nonliving, we have given it statutory primacyover humanity. In the industrialized world, the wishes and desires ofcorporations generally hold more power than the wants and needs of the public.The modern corporation is an entity endowed with one purpose only: to makemoney. True, a growing number of corporations are managed by executives withconscience and consciousness. These are the heartening seeds of a future worldin which corporations serve people, but that is a far cry from today’s world inwhich people serve corporations. A further discussion of how the Rule of Goldhas overruled the Golden Rule will be found in Chapter 9, Dysfunction at theJunction.A world-threatening implication of the Newtonian preoccupation with matterinvolves the desire to accumulate matter. Never has the world seen a society sopossessed by material possessions and so consumed by consumerism.Those born into Western society since the end of World War II, and particularlythose in the United States, have been influenced and programmed by television tosuch an extent that they hardly grasp the power that media has over their lives.From the early days when Howdy Doody exhorted kids to tell their moms to buyWonder Bread to the present time when the Baby Channel enables young consumersto develop brand name recognition while still in diapers, humans have beenreduced to the status of consumers and customers.Conscious of the life-threatening consequences of corporate commoditization ofglobal resources, more and more individuals and organizations are seeking tointroduce human values into the economy. The forces that promote human evolutionand sanity are often perceived as defensive fringe groups fighting a losingbattle in spite of the fact that the majority of humans truly value life abovemoney. The harbingers of the new humanity are, indeed, up against a mightyadversary—perhaps the world’s most powerful force and a largely invisible one atthat—because they are challenging civilization’s basal paradigm, the fundamentalbeliefs that shape our way of life.The conventional paradigm of Newtonian materialism, reductionism, anddeterminism also has provided the fundamental structure of our academicinstitutions. Students, the products of schools, are graded and rated bymeasuring their achievements. What better way to know who is better than bymeasuring? And how better to distribute the financial rewards of materialismthan by rewarding those who prove they can produce? Of course, the questions“Produce what?” and “For what purpose?” remain largely unanswered, not tomention unasked.The realm of medicine, which is the voice of materialistic science, has savedmany lives.. However, the primarily Newtonian treatments have continuouslyproven to be costly, often ineffective, and, at times, life threatening. Inalignment with the philosophy of materialism, conventional medicine only focuseson the physical character of the body through efforts designed to adjust andmanipulate the body’s chemistry, even though working with the body’s energyfields has proven to be far more efficient and effective.We must fully acknowledge that modern science has created outright miracles,especially in trauma medicine, by using a Newtonian approach that perceives thebody as a machine. Medical marvels include the ability to take the body apartand put it back together, transplant organs, and even create spare parts. But inspite of all the technical knowledge, we are still outmaneuvered by and live infear of the lowly bacteria and viruses that continually threaten our existence.Those who go outside mainstream medicine and experience anomalous healings andspontaneous remissions often find a startling lack of curiosity on the part oftraditional medical authorities. This is especially true if the physician cannotinvoke a conventionally accepted physical, material explanation to account forthe healing. In such situations, doctors often tell their patients they reallydid not have the disease in the first place—in spite of what the x-rays and CATscans showed, it was simply a misdiagnosis. In far too many cases, physiciansnot only dismiss miraculous cures, they actually turn a deaf ear to their healedpatients by responding, “Whatever you did, I don’t want to hear about it.”Fortunately, the acceptance of holistic medicine is doing much to dispelmaterialistic medical dogma. There’s nothing like a friend’s successfultreatment to motivate a visit to some complementary health care practitioner. Westill have far to go to dismantle the limitations imposed by Newtonian thought,but as we will soon see, the important field of study is the field itself.IT’S IN THE FIELDSo . . . the first key myth-perception of the apocalypse, only matter matters,is wrong.Science, itself, through its own courageous quest for the truth, has disprovedits own pet dogma. But if matter doesn’t matter as much as we once believed,what does? To quote Einstein: “The field is the only reality.”But if matter is so nonmaterial, why does it seem so real? And if that brickwall is, indeed, an illusion, why can’t I put my hand through it? As physicistshave discovered, it isn’t the density of matter that stops us, it’s the densityof energy.At the subatomic level, vortices of energy are constantly spinning andvibrating. If the notion of energy vortex seems too abstract, visualize amini-tornado, which is a whirling vortex of wind energy. When we observe atornado, what we actually see are the swirling particles and debris—dirt,shingles, tree limbs, Mrs. O’Grady’s cat—swept up in a field powerful enough toimplode buildings and hurl vehicles. You cannot put your hand through a solidwall for the same reason you cannot drive your car through a tornado; invisibleenergy forces are palpable.And lest we be fooled into thinking empty space is actually empty, the invisibleis abuzz with more energy than we can imagine. What Aristotle referred to as“the plenum” and physicists named the “zero-point field” is a “quantum sea oflight.” According to American physicist Richard Feynman, the energy in a singlecubic foot of perceived empty space is enough to boil all the oceans in theworld.6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en81] So, paradoxically, nothing—nothing—is more powerful than any thing! Perhaps zero-point energy is the energyof the future, which is great incentive to actually have a future!Another marvelously puzzling paradox about physical reality is that ittechnically doesn’t exist. According to journalist Lynne McTaggart, author ofThe Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, this zero-point fieldis “an ocean of microscopic vibrations in the space between things—a state ofpure potential and infinite possibility.” McTaggart wrote: “Particles exist inall possible states until disturbed by us—by observing or measuring—at whichpoint, they settle down, at long last into something real.” In other words,reality exists on a need-to-exist basis.7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en82]Although physicists find it hard to reach a consensus on something so vast andmind-boggling, the current unconventional wisdom indicates that everything iseverywhere all the time and our minds pluck things out of the cosmic soup andsort them into time and space, thus creating what we assume to be reality. Byplaying in the field’s cosmic soup, scientists have been able to send signalsgreat distances instantaneously and have even found ways to affect events thatalready happened! But more about that later.For now, let’s consider a simple experiment based on observations familiar tomany people described in Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, abook and video by British biologist Rupert Sheldrake. An article in Journal forthe Society of Psychical Research reports that 45 percent of the dog ownerssurveyed claimed their animal knew in advance when a household member wasreturning home.8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en83]In Sheldrake’s experiment, which was videotaped for Austrian TV, video cameraswith time codes were simultaneously trained on dog owner Pam Smart, who was outof her home, and her homebound dog, Jaytee. At a random time, unbeknownst toeither Pam or her dog, she received a call on her cell phone telling her toreturn home. At that very instant, Jaytee ran to the door to await his owner.Similar results were confirmed in over one hundred videotaped experiments.9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en84]So why is this important? Most of us know there is a special and, perhaps,psychic connection between pets and their owners, just as many of us have hadthe experience of knowing when a loved one was in trouble. The significance isnot that Sheldrake proved something we already know, but that the experimentevoked little curiosity in the scientific community.Just imagine: dogs receivinginstant messages at speeds faster than the speed of light, and scientists arenot even curious about how they do it?The problem is that materialistic science cannot come up with an explanation forthis phenomenon, nor does it care to. Just as the Church refused to acknowledgethe implications of Copernicus conclusion about Earth’s position in ourheliocentric solar system, orthodox science must ignore the demonstrated fact ofcanine instant messaging because it flat out contradicts their belief that onlymatter matters. There is an unexplainable invisible field at work that canprovide us with telepathic communications, but because science doesn’t believein the invisible, well, they just can’t see it.Sheldrake suggested there is a morphic field, which he described as “memoryinherent in nature,” wherein communications we would call psychic can be sent atthe speed of thought.10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en85] He would bethe first to admit that his morphic field concept is merely a speculativeexplanation that doesn’t prove how it works. But, fortunately, that lack of ascientific explanation has spurred him toward further experimentation with thefield.The importance of Sheldrake’s experiment is that it demonstrates that thephenomenon is real and that an influential invisible field does, indeed, exist.And the implications are far more significant than being able to call your dogby whistling in your head. As we will see, carefully constructed double-blindexperiments have shown that prayer and healing intentions have had a measurablepositive effect on AIDS patients and those recovering from surgery. Similarly,studies also indicate that when the number of people practicing transcendentalmeditation reaches the square root of one percent of the population in a givencity, the crime rate falls precipitously.11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en86]Clearly, it is foolish for us to ignore the power of the field simply because wecan’t explain it. And fortunately, more scientists are becoming curious.Physicists are already there, in a sense, as evidenced by their use of thephrase “invisible moving force” to describe these fields. Interestingly, that isthe same definition of the traditional Shaper of Fields—God, Creator, Spirit, orwhatever term you choose to describe the unifying force in the Universe. Thecosmic joke is this: science and religion are essentially each describing thesame thing.So why is understanding the field important? And how can that understanding helpus? The answer is three-fold: First, we can end, once and for all, the uselessargument between science and religion. Instead of fighting over the existence ofan off-planet God, we can work together for on-planet good. Second, byacknowledging the power of invisible fields—even if we don’t understand them—weopen up an entire new field of inquiry and challenge science to explore what ithas previously ignored. Finally, we can realize that humanity is operating on aunified field of dreams, and we can rejoice that the field is a playing field,not a battlefield."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6MYTH-PERCEPTION TWO: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST“When your only intention is looking out for number one, everyone and everythingelse gets treated like number two.”— Swami Beyondananda “It’s a dog eat dog world.” “It’s a jungle out there.” “Every man for himself.”We’ve heard these catchphrases so many times that we’ve embedded them into whatwe call reality.But what if the Darwinian philosophy about the competitive nature of life is allwrong? What if cooperation and sharing are the entire reason for our evolution?What if survival is really dependent on how well we communicate with each otherand how quickly we share and process information? And what if there is a worldcondition much better than mere survival? What if there’s also a state ofthrival?WHICH CAME FIRST, DARWIN OR DARWINISM?Charles Darwin, who was also a child of his times, played one of the mostimportant roles in establishing the paradigm of scientific materialism,especially as it applies to human health and the evolution of humanity.Evolutionary thought had been ripening for nearly a century and even his owngrandfather Erasmus Darwin had studied and written about the subject.In fact, the first scientific paper on evolution, Philosophie Zoologique, waspublished by French biologist John Baptiste de Lamarck in 1809, the year Darwinwas born.1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en87] And phrases that we haveattributed to Darwinism—the law of the jungle and survival of the fittest—werealso well-established before Charles Darwin’s birth.The opening act for Charles Darwin’s opus was performed by Thomas RobertMalthus. Malthus was an economic philosopher whose beliefs and writings providedthe theoretical foundation for Darwinian theory. He was also the son of aleading light of the Age of Enlightenment who counted as his friendsJean-Jacques Rousseau and philosopher and economist David Hume. Yet youngMalthus took a deeper, darker view of the world than his mentors. Perhaps inrebellion against his father, Malthus championed a pessimistic position inregard to world affairs. He set out not only to prove the glass was half emptybut also that it would soon be three-quarters empty, then seven-eighths empty,and on and on subtractum infinitum.Using logical constructs and linear projections popular at the time, Malthusconcluded and subsequently wrote that vegetation reproduced at an arithmeticprogression rate:1 => 2 => 3 => 4 => 5 => etc.In contrast, he suggested that animal life reproduced at a geometric progressionrate:2 => 4 => 8 => 16 => 32 => etc.Malthus’s logic went thusly: a farmer managing his land could, with effort andluck, possibly raise an extra bushel of feed in each succeeding year. However,his animal population would double as offspring continued to spring off witheach generation and would rapidly diminish the farmer’s ability to produce feedfor them. Thus, animal life, which, of course, includes humans, would reproduceto the point that we exceed our food supply. In such a reality, life would trulybecome an ongoing struggle for existence in which only the strongest and mostruthless survive.Malthus described the consequences of his vision of reality in his 1798 worktitled An Essay on the Principle of Population: “The power of population is sosuperior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that prematuredeath must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind areactive and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the greatarmy of destruction and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But shouldthey fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence,and plague advance in terrific array and sweep off their thousands and tens ofthousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalksin the rear and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of theworld.”2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en88]Well, at least, the upside of pessimism is that you can never be disappointed.But the essence of Malthus’s concern didn’t have to do with things gettingworse, but with them actually getting better. What if nations curtailed warfare?What if poverty was eliminated and disease cured? Then, according to Malthus, wewould really have a mess on our hands! The more successful we became at savinglives, the sooner we would run out of food. Malthusiasts of the 19th centuryengaged all kinds of social programs to forestall this inevitability, includingdiscouraging the poor from breeding and the creation of slums in swamps wheredisease would cull the poor from the herd.However, there is a minor problem with Malthus’s gloomy projections—they happento be false! Seeing the world from a strictly materialist, linear point of view,Malthus was blind to the dynamic complexities inherent within the web of lifeand to Nature’s tendency toward balance and harmony. Furthermore, animalpopulations simply do not double every year, and their rate of increase is,again, a total variable based upon prevailing environmental conditions.Malthus’s linear mathematical conclusions, currently defined as “staticprojection,” would only be reasonable in a linear, mechanistic NewtonianUniverse.Fortunately, the Universe we live in is a probability-based quantum reality thatis greatly affected by chaos, which is, in the world of mathematics and physics,defined as a system that outwardly appears random but is, in reality, quiteordered and deterministic. In a chaotic Universe, static projections are uselessbecause they fail to factor in the dynamic and unpredictable processes of livingsystems. The whole Malthusian notion that evolution is driven by a bloody andbrutal battle for survival actually has no scientific merit.THE EVOLUTION OF DARWINDarwin, whose life spanned three quarters of the 19th century, came into a worldwhen many views shared an uneasy coexistence. The bright shaft of light calledthe Age of Enlightenment, which was the philosophy that bred the American andFrench revolutions a generation earlier, was still shining, although dimmed bythe darkness of creeping Malthusianism. The return of the monarchy in France hadrecently revitalized the Church, breathing life into its quest to retain itspowerful paradigmatic crown. And, in the background, the progress of materialistscience was steadily moving forward through the work of English chemist JohnDalton and his atomic theory, published in 1805, which brought Newtonian physicsdown to earth by employing its principles to define the mechanics of the newlyminted science of chemistry.Although Charles Darwin was born into an upper-class family of Unitarians andfreethinkers, his father, in deference to convention, had young Charles baptizedin the Anglican Church. As a child, Darwin attended Unitarian Church with hismother. He later enrolled at the University of Edinburgh, where he eagerlystudied science and attended lectures on Jean Baptiste de Lamarck’s radicaltheories of evolution.Apparently, pre-med wasn’t Charles’s calling—his poor academic performancecaused him to leave the university without completing his degree. His father,concerned that Charles would become a ne’er-do-well (or, at best, asometime-do-well), encouraged him to enroll at the University of Cambridge tobecome an Anglican cleric. For a dropout. upper-middle class Englishman, theministry was his last resort.Darwin completed his theological studies and, immediately upon graduation and inspite of his father’s protests, signed on to a two-year voyage on the HMS Beagleas a gentlemen’s mate to Captain Robert Fitz-Roy. In the British navy duringthat time, aristocrats such as Captain Fitz-Roy were not allowed to socializewith the commoners who comprised the crew. To make his voyage tolerable, FitzRoyoffered Darwin a position as traveling companion on a voyage to survey thewonders of Nature.While at sea, the Beagle’s doctor, who was also the ship’s official naturalistand in charge of wildlife survey, had a confrontation with young Charles. Thedoctor resolved the conflict by jumping ship in South America. Conveniently,Charles assumed the official post of naturalist as the Beagle sailed toward theGalapagos Islands for what would become an historic voyage of paradigmaticproportions. The two-year journey lasted five years, during which time Darwinimmersed himself in his study of Nature.Before the voyage, Darwin received a copy of Principles of Geology, which waspublished in 1830 and was, perhaps, the most important scientific publicationsince Newton’s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Its author, CharlesLyell, was the most distinguished and influential scientist in the world at thattime and for good reason. His Principles of Geology, published in three volumesin 1830 to 1833, established the science of geology and, in doing so, underminedthe Church’s Biblical interpretation of Creation.Until that time, people held the sacrosanct belief that the Heavens, Earth, andlife were the result of God’s amazing six-day tour de force described inGenesis. The Church was so secure in its stand on this issue that it evenoffered, as a religious fact, the exact date that God gave birth to Earth. Incase you were thinking of buying Gaia a birthday card, that was Sunday, October23, 4004 B.C.E. James Ussher, an Anglican bishop, determined this date bycalculating the lineage of Biblical begats back to the appearance of Adam.3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en89]While most people of the day blindly accepted this date for Creation,geologists, led by Lyell, estimated that planet Earth had evolved through eonsof gradual, yet dynamic, upheavals, which, in geological terms, resulted in awarping and repositioning of Earth’s crust. Lyell concluded that the physicaldisposition of continents, oceans, and mountains was the result of slow, steadyalterations by natural forces such as winds, rains, floods, earthquakes, andvolcanoes.Lyell’s book contained four chapters dedicated to Lamarck’s theories, which alsosuggested that life arose through a long, slow evolutionary progression overmillions of years during which some organisms became extinct, a situation thatexplained fossils. To Lyell, evolution of the biosphere was a perfect complementto evolution of the physical planet. Lyell’s writings did much to open thepublic’s eyes to a whole new view regarding the origin, or Creation, of theworld.During his five-year voyage, Darwin immersed himself in Lyell’s book and, in asense, became a Lyell groupie, regularly corresponding with this prestigiousscientific authority. The novel insights offered by Lyell and Lamarck helpedshape Darwin’s ultimate conclusion that the succession of life in Earth-historyshould be ascribed, like geological phenomena, to natural causes.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en90]Darwin acknowledged the significance of Lyell’s contribution to the formulationof his theory of evolution when he published the second edition of his Journalof Researches in 1845. Darwin dedicated this book to Lyell, with the followingexplanation: “The chief part of whatever scientific merit this journal and otherworks of the author may possess, have been derived from studying the well-knownand admirable Principles of Geology.”5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en91]On October 2, 1836, Darwin arrived home in London. He met with and immediatelybecame a lifelong friend of Lyell who encouraged him to pursue his studies onthe theory of evolution. As an upshot of their discussions, Darwin began tocompile his first notebook on the Transmutation of Species, the title of whichwas also the original term for evolution coined by Lamarck in his PhilosophieZoologique in 1809.6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en92]So, while Lamarck provided a scientific foundation for biological evolution andLyell drew a correlation between that and evolution of the physical planet,Darwin focused on providing insight into the forces or mechanisms that drove ormotivated the evolutionary process. He was specifically concerned with thereasons why new species should appear at all. Without an answer to thatquestion, Darwin’s theory languished for years until, ironically, he found theinspiration to advance his concept in the work of Malthus.7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en93]Darwin wrote in his autobiography: “In October 1838, that is, fifteen monthsafter I had begun my systematic inquiry, I happened to read for amusementMalthus on Population, and being well-prepared to appreciate the struggle forexistence which everywhere goes on, from long continued observation of thehabits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under thesecircumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourableones to be destroyed.”8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en94]In other words, Darwin was saying that, while Malthus focused on the selectionprocess as a means through which the weak elements of a society are eliminated,he, Darwin, put his own spin on the selection process by emphasizing thesurvival of the stronger individuals. This was a politically savvy move becauseDarwin was a gentleman in Victorian England, a culture that had an upper classand a lower class. Rather than attributing the selection process to theinfluence of a menial lower class, Darwin emphasized that it was good breedingand heredity of the upper class—those having the “favourable variations” andpresumably being the fittest—that drove evolution. Therefore, in his writing,Darwin rephrased what Malthus called “Nature’s process of selection” in theelimination of society’s unfavorable elements into what Darwin termed naturalselection.DARWIN’S INDELICATE ARRANGEMENTBy the early 1840s, Darwin began to develop his theory, but he did not share hisconclusions with anyone, not even Charles Lyell. In 1844, Darwin wrote to theluminary botanist SirJoseph Dalton Hooker, “at last gleams of light have come,and I am almost convinced (quite to the contrary of the opinion I started with)that species are not (it is like confessing to a murder) immutable.”9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en95] The murder Darwin referred to was themurder of God. If the theory were valid that species individually descendedthrough a process of evolutionary transformation, that would kill the legitimacyof the first book of the Bible, the part of the Scripture that defines therelationship between God and the human race. It is also interesting to note thatDarwin wrote, “I am almost convinced” that species could mutate. Clearly, evenhe did not yet believe in evolution.Later that year, Scottish journalist Robert Chambers anonymously published,Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a widely read book that championedevolution over creationism. Even though it was controversial and attacked byVictorian society, this book popularized the notion of evolution and broke theice for Darwin to publish without professionally perishing.Yet, Darwin kept stalling for more than a decade until prodded into action by acolleague’s work. In June 1858, Charles Darwin received a package that wouldstir him to action. It was sent by Alfred Russel Wallace, an English naturalistworking in Borneo. Wallace was a naturalist as good as or better than Darwinhimself but was also, unfortunately, a self-educated, working class commoner. Toearn a living, Wallace caught specimens and sold them to museums, zoologicalparks, and wealthy collectors, and, in the process, became a great naturalist.Wallace sent Darwin a copy of a manuscript titled On the Tendency of Varietiesto Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type along with a letter requestingthat Darwin review the material and, if he found it of merit, pass it on toCharles Lyell.10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en96] This manuscript wasWallace’s theory of evolution. It was brief, elegant, academic, extremelywell-written and would have qualified Wallace as the rightful “founder of theevolution theory,” a title now attributed to Darwin alone.Not wanting the prestige of formulating the theory of evolution to fall upon acommoner, Darwin beseeched Lyell for help to preserve his precious self-claimedpriority in this profoundly important discovery. In a letter dated June 26,1858, Darwin wrote: “It seems hard on me that I should be thus compelled to losemy priority of many years standing . . .”11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en97] Lyell came to the aid of Darwin, hisdistraught junior colleague, by engaging their mutual friend Sir Joseph Hookerin what was to become known as the “delicate arrangement” regarding “one of thegreatest conspiracies in the annals of science.”12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en98]Lyell and Hooker crafted a letter in which they claimed that Darwin and Wallacewere acquaintances. The letter stated that both “gentlemen having, independentlyand unknown to one another, conceived the same very ingenious theory . . . mayboth fairly claim the merit of being original thinkers in this important line ofinquiry.”13 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en99] The simple truth is thatWallace had, in hand, a fully evolved written theory and Darwin had merely along-incubated, but unhatched, idea! However, Lyell used his status toorchestrate fabrications, alter documents, and plagiarize so that Darwin, thearistocrat, would get first billing while Wallace, the commoner, would receivethe dubious honor of being listed as second, or junior, contributor. The theoryof evolution—officially described as the Darwin-Wallace theory—was formallyintroduced at the Linnean Society of London on July 1, 1858, one month afterDarwin received the package.On the surface, this bit of skullduggery might seem to be trivial in regard tothe history of humanity, but we can assure you this incident has had profoundreverberations that continue to impact us today. The difference between whetherWallace or Darwin received credit for the theory is the evolutionary epitome ofthe glass being half full or half empty.From the perspective of a commoner, Wallace recognized that evolution was drivenby the elimination of the weakest, while Darwin interpreted the same data tomean that evolution resulted from the will to survive inherent in the fittest.The difference? In a Wallacean world, we would improve in order not to be theweakest, but in a Darwinian world, we struggle to acquire the status of beingthe best. In other words, had Wallace prevailed, there would be less focus oncompetition and more on cooperation.A year after the delicate arrangement, Alfred Russel Wallace dissolved into thebackground as Darwin gained worldwide prominence with the publication of hismasterpiece, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. The content ofthis best-selling book popularized the concepts of evolution and naturalselection and implanted into the world the chilling notion that only the fittestsurvive.What brought this book to the attention of the world more than anything else wasits subtitle, which offered a more penetrating view of the Darwinism we wouldcome to know. The full title is The Origin of Species by Means of NaturalSelection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. Itshould be emphasized here, that Darwin was a product of his times. While he wasradical enough to build on the geological implications of Lyell’s work, he alsoaccepted without question Malthus’s conclusions, which we now know to be faulty.While biological success obviously comes from adapting to an environment, fromthe Malthusian standpoint, that adaptation primarily takes place in the fightover scarce resources.The concept of social Darwinism, the term coined by philosopher HerbertSpencer—who, coincidentally, is also credited with inventing the term survivalof the fittest—emphasizes the harsh implication of Darwinian theory. That theoryencourages improving humanity by purifying the race, which, of course, meanswinnowing out unfavorable genetic inferiors. Taken to its fullest application,Darwinian theory became the state-sanctioned science and mission of NaziGermany.In his later years, Darwin moved away from academic Darwinism. Rather thanemphasizing survival and struggle, Darwin readdressed his attention to focus onthe evolution of love, altruism, and the genetic roots of human kindness. Inaddition, Darwin began to credit the Lamarckian concept of the environment asthe driving force in evolution. Unfortunately, Darwin’s disciples thought hisnew ideas were tantamount to sedition, undermining all that Darwinism had cometo stand for. Darwinists simply held on to their version of the theory anddismissed Darwin’s later ideas as the consequence of his creeping senility.Within ten years of its publication, the majority of the world’s scientistsessentially accepted Darwin’s theory as truth. But it had a much more powerfulimpact on the evolution of human civilization than most people realize, andthat’s because Darwin provided a missing piece that would change civilization’sbasal paradigm. Before The Origin of Species, monotheism shaped the culturalbeliefs of Western civilization because it was the only source of truth thatcould provide satisfactory answers to each of the three perennial questions:1. How did we get here?2. Why are we here?3. Now that we’re here, how do we make best of it?While science was making miraculous advances and steadily eroding the Church’spowerbase, it could not unseat monotheism as civilization’s “official” truthprovider until it offered “We evolved.” as the answer to “How did we get here?”HOW WE INHERITED SURVIVAL OF THE FITTESTAt the time The Origin of Species was published, the general public was verymuch engaged in breeding plants and animals and was quite familiar withhereditary alterations that influenced the structural and behavioral traits ofoffspring. It was not a far reach for laymen to accept Darwin’s view that lifeon this planet evolved from a primitive ancestor who was followed by a longlineage of reproductive variations over millions of years. Consequently, thetheory of evolution made sense and was readily accepted by both science and thepopulace. This acceptance put science in a position to provide a public-approvedand satisfactory answer to that pesky perennial question regarding origins, ananswer much more acceptable to the majority than the former view of Creationoffered by monotheism.Not surprisingly, the Church launched an aggressive campaign to counter theheresy of the godless evolutionists. The anticipated confrontation betweenreligion and science came to a head only seven months after the publication ofThe Origin of Species. The showdown took place during a meeting held by theBritish Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University in Juneof 1860. The meeting was distinguished by the fact that two scholarly papers,based on the new theory of evolution, were to be presented for publicconsideration. A scheduled debate ensued between Bishop Samuel Wilberforce,representing the creationists, and Thomas Huxley, a friend of Darwin and achampion of his theory.In a time before movies, radio, and television, debates commanded publicattention for more than just the information they conveyed. Debates wereentertainment. It was public theater wherein contestants would duel to themetaphorical death, verbally lashing each other with razor sharp wit punctuatedwith high drama and biting satire. Bishop Wilberforce, a topnotch debater, wasreferred to as “Soapy Sam” because of the craftiness he displayed in gaining theadvantage. In other words, Sam was slippery.Wilberforce did not come to conquer evolution; he came to exorcise its evilspirit from the mind of the people. His expressed intent was to humiliate theevolutionists and reestablish in the public’s mind the Church’s belief inCreation. No record was kept of the actual debate, but Wilberforce apparentlysummed up his argument with a contrived question to make Huxley look like a foolno matter how he chose to answer it. A version of the question, which playedupon Victorian reverence to family lineage and motherhood, went: “Let me ask Mr.Huxley one question. Is it through his grandfather or his grandmother that heclaims descent from a monkey?”Huxley, who was known as “Darwin’s Bulldog,” was hesitant to even attend thedebate due to apprehension of being entrapped by Soapy Sam’s rhetoric. However,he hit Wilberforce right between the eyes with his now famous reply: “I willanswer your question, my Lord Bishop. An ape may seem to you to be a poor sortof creature, of low intelligence and stooping gait that grins and chatters as wepass. But I would rather have an ape for an ancestor than a man who is preparedto prostitute his undoubted gift of elegance and culture to the service ofprejudice and falsehood.”14 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en100]Huxley’s magic bullet not only felled Wilberforce, it mortally wounded theChurch. In a matter of moments, the debate—as well as the monotheisticparadigm—was over. After nearly two thousand years of overseeing the course ofhumanity, the Church was forced to relinquish the torch of knowledge and, withit, control of Western civilization’s basal paradigm. The future was now in thehands of scientific materialism.A DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD . . . NOT!Prior to the 17th century, science viewed life as a harmonious process, one ofthe last vestigial beliefs of animism and its descendant, deism. But in thecentury before Darwin and in the years following his death, the cultural pictureof Nature went from nurturing mother to violent jungle.Largely, this change in image was based on erroneous conclusions derived frombiased observations using distorted science. What we observe as violence inNature is the result of both predator-prey relationships and rivalry overterritory, food, and mates. However, the latter form of violence is rarely ifever fatal. Once dominance has been established and acknowledged in aterritorial dispute, the defeated animal slinks away, still living. So it’s mostdefinitely not a dog-eat-dog world. Yes, it’s a dog-eat-squirrel world and adog-growl-at-dog world, but dogs just don’t eat other dogs.While we humans are, indeed, part of the web of life, we are, fortunately,perched atop the food chain. We no longer have natural predators and so, as morethan one cynical philosopher has observed, we prey on one another. There is adistinct difference between the violence of hunting a deer, which is a naturalprocess in the established web of life, and hunting a deer hunter, which is abehavior that falls far outside of Nature’s inherent morality. Our fundamentalpreoccupation with violence as a way of life is truly a misinterpretation ofNature.Whether by accident or design, the use of violence far predates Darwin as alowest-common-dominator operating system, wherein might makes right. However,Darwinian theory offered humanity a scientific justification for inhumaneactions, including individual violence and the collective use of force,especially if the latter helps eliminate the burgeoning, applecart-upsettinglower class masses.Darwinism also dealt the Church another low blow when it undermined thereligious notion of morality in regard to justification of means and ends. In asurvival-of-the-fittest mentality, Darwinian fitness is the ability of apopulation to maintain or increase its numbers in succeeding generations.Therefore, fitness through health or fit progeny represents an end. How wehumans attain that end, be it through compassion or an Uzi, is entirelyirrelevant.In the end, Darwinian theory encouraged the “favoured races” to treat themselvesto even more favorable treatment. Even worse, Darwinism gave tacit permissionfor each nation to advance its own “favoured race” at the expense of the whole.And so Darwinian theory delivered Western civilization from monotheism’s laws ofthe scriptures to scientific materialism’s law of the jungle. No rules or moralguidelines . . . just Darwinners and Darlosers.While few people have actually read and understood Darwin’s complete works, thephrase survival of the fittest is well known, but mostly misunderstood. Thephrase isn’t a scientific concept but a tautology, which is just a fancy way ofdefining what something is by stating what it is. For example, the dictionarydefines the word fit, in biological terms, as being able to survive. WhenDarwinists invoke the mantra survival of the fittest, they are actually saying,“survival of those most able to survive.” Well, yeah. But when fed into thehuman psyche, replete with images of lions chasing down gazelles, survival ofthe fittest takes on a more life-threatening, adrenaline-pumping significance.However, if we take a look at the jungle, we find that the law of the jungledoesn’t even apply there! When a lion takes off after a gazelle, the liondoesn’t care about the fittest or capturing the one with the biggest antlers tolater be a suitable trophy in his den. In fact, she goes after the least fitbecause she’s hungry and wants to be sure she gets something to eat. Moreprecisely, the law of the jungle is actually the non-survival of thenon-fittest. By definition, to survive, you don’t need to be the fittest, allyou need to be is—well, fit. In another way of looking at it, consider thepercentage of gazelles that don’t get eaten by a lion every day.An evolutionary lesson in not being the weakest is humorously portrayed in thestory of two campers in the woods who wake up to find a bear in their camp. Onestarts putting on his shoes, and the other says, “Why are you putting on yourshoes? You can’t outrun a bear.” The first one says, “Who needs to outrun thebear? I only have to outrun you.”THRIVAL OF THE FITTINGESTAs the path of humanity’s evolution continues its swing toward a more balanced,holistic perception of life, we see that the new rules of quantum science applyto the theory of evolution as well.Studies now emphasize that evolution occurs in the context of an environment—notseparate from it. The progress of evolution can be seen as an environmentconstantly seeking to rebalance itself. For example, let’s say organism #1 eatsX in the environment and poops Y. As #1’s population increases, its food sourceX necessarily diminishes, while its waste product Y simultaneously increases.While the loss of X and the buildup of Y throw the environment a little out ofbalance, the situation also provides an opportunity for the evolution of a neworganism, #2, that thrives on eating Y and excreting Z. As #2’s populationincreases, it causes the level Y to return to balance but at the cost ofincreasing the amount of Z in the environment, which, in turn, supports thefuture evolution of Z-eating organism #3. And so on, and so on. This is anoversimplified example and yet, as sophisticated systems theorists are showingus, it is, indeed, the case.In his 1998 article in the prestigious journal Nature, British scientist TimothyLenton provided important support for the Gaia hypothesis formulated byscientist, environmentalist, and futurist James Lovelock. Lovelock suggestedthat Earth, itself, is a living entity that uses evolution to regulate its ownexceedingly complex metabolism. Lenton described how the sun has warmed by 25percent since life on Earth began some 3.8 billion years ago, and, yet, theplanet has somehow been able to regulate its climate and buffer that hugetemperature differential. Lenton suggests that evolutionary traits that benefitthe system as a whole tend to be reinforced, while those that alter ordestabilize the environment in an unfavorable way are restrained.Lenton concluded, “If an organism acquires a mutation that causes it to behavein an ‘anti-Gaian’ manner, its spread will be restricted in that it will be atan evolutionary disadvantage.”15 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en101] Moreto the point and applied to our current situation, Lenton is suggesting that ifwe humans don’t find ways to evolve that are more harmonious with the planet, wemay find ourselves homeless.What we have failed to realize is that the real evolutionary principle is“thrival of the fittingest.” Those organisms that best fit the environment bycontributing and supporting global harmony get to thrive while the others—well .. .THE ANSWERS LIE WITHINBut, perhaps, the most cogent example of the real nature of life, the examplethat shows us the way out of the Malthusian dilemma of scarcity and points us inthe direction of our next evolution, pertains to the origins and development ofmulticellular life forms on this planet.Why is it, and how is it, that trillions of single-celled organisms were able tocombine forces to become us?To answer this question, we must remember that, for the first 3.8 billion yearsof life on this planet, the only life forms were single-celled organisms such asbacteria, algae, yeast, and protozoans.Around 700 million years ago, cells started to assemble into primitivemulticellular colonial organisms. By sharing information, new communalassociations provided greater awareness of the surrounding environment andenhanced the life of their constituent cells. Simply, environmental awareness,which is a measure of evolution, affords an organism a greater opportunity toeffectively and efficiently survive in a dynamic world. Two can live as cheaplyas one, so joining forces is better than going it alone.Initially, in the early stages of evolution, all the cells in colonial organismscarried out the same functions. However, there came a time when the number ofcells that comprised an organism became so large that it was no longeradvantageous for all cells to do the same thing.Imagine, for example, that we’re still a hunter-gatherer society and eachmorning eight million New Yorkers commute to Westchester County to forage forfood. It is far more effective to split up life-sustaining responsibilitiesamong the members of the tribe. In this case, hunters would go out into theworld while others in the community would stay home and perform various choressuch as cooking, raising the kids, maintaining tools, watching TV, and so on.This is exactly what happened in the evolution of multicellular organisms. Astheir communal numbers increased to thousands, millions, and trillions,individual cells in the community took on specialized jobs to support thesurvival of the whole organism. Biologists refer to this division of theworkload among constituent cells as the process of differentiation.As the structures of the differentiating cell communities evolved further, theyultimately created a multitude of emergent species—an evolution unimaginable tothe single-celled organisms that thrived in the first 3.8 billion years of life.The formation of multicellular communities was, in a sense, a quantum leap inthe course of evolution on this planet. Therefore, we might be tempted to thinkthe current sentient human organism represents the fully tweaked evolutionaryendpoint. But, in reality, the human is actually at the beginning of the nextand higher level of evolution, the emergent multi-human super-organism known asHumanity.The notion of survival of the fittest has been applied in our individualisticculture to mean survival of the fittest individuals. The sad truth, however, isthat Gaia couldn’t care less about the fittest because she is more concernedabout the impact the whole population has on its global metabolism, theenvironment. Regardless of how many Gandhis, Mother Teresas, and Leonardo daVincis we produce, at the current time, our entire species is being measured,not for its fitness, but for its “fittingness.” Perhaps we, like our single-cellforebears, must now leave our single-cell individuality behind and evolve into acoherent multicellular whole, wherein self-interest and planetary interest areone and the same.FROM THE SELFISH GENE TO THE SELFLESS GENIUSThe current human society has taken to heart the notion of competition as ameans to survival even though that word has been distorted and misinterpretedfrom its original Greek etymology where “to compete” meant “to strive together.”To the Greeks, the notion of competition meant using the energy of each other’sperformance to enhance one’s own; it did not imply that we should crush ouropponents or try to win at any cost.While exceeding one’s personal best is certainly a worthy ambition, consider allthe contests and games in which there are far, far more losers than winners. Themovie, Mad Hot Ballroom, an excellent and inspiring documentary about teachingtroubled inner-city students self-respect through ballroom dancing,unfortunately offered the down side caused by misinterpreting competition.Despite the learning, the enjoyment, and the growth that came from strivingtogether in the dance competition, all but the final winners were reduced totears because they failed to win. Now, how in Heaven’s name does that makesense?On the darker side, Enron, once heralded by Forbes magazine and The Wall StreetJournal as the “company of the future” and, later, shown to be rotten to thecore, made Darwinism their company credo. CEO Jeffrey Skilling touted hisfavorite book, The Selfish Gene by British science writer Richard Dawkins, ashis Bible and, in true Darwinian fashion, took pride in culling the herdperiodically at Enron in an effort to enhance corporate fitness. He would gointo a division and tell the employees that he would fire the bottom 10 percentof producers during the next quarter. And he did exactly that. The pressure ofthe selection process created a ruthless, free-for-all atmosphere in which yourbest friend could become your worst enemy on judgment day.The misunderstood notion of competition as a judge of evolutionary fitness wasferociously carried over into all of the company’s dealings. If you have theopportunity to view the movie, Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, you’ll hearand see traders gleefully talk about “screwing grandmothers out of theirpensions,” cheer for ravaging life-threatening fires that were increasing thevalue of their stocks, or celebrate the collapse of an entire state’s economy asthey reap windfalls from the victims.16[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en102]But that laughter was to die out abruptly because, in true reptilian fashion,Enron’s corporate officers ate their young by sinking the company and runningoff with their employees’ payrolls, pensions, and stock annuities. The fall ofthe house of Enron, and the resulting shock waves it sent into a blithelyDarwinian business community, was an important wake-up call concerning theunworkability of short-term individual gain, including a paramount focus on nextquarter profits. Yet, the very same faulty thinking behind the selfish genestill persists and keeps us from facing our true genius.WE’RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHERPerhaps the most important message offered by both quantum physics and fieldexperiments is that everything is related. Our Universe is not hierarchical andlinear; it’s relational and fractal.What do we mean by fractal? Fractal geometry, as we will see later, is thebranch of mathematics that describes the patterns of Nature. When you look at aleaf, a stem, a branch, a tree, or a forest, or when you observe a seashore fromvarying distances, you notice a repeating, self-similar pattern at differentlevels of complexity.Self-similar fractal patterns repeat themselves throughout every level oforganization in the natural world. Hence, our cells, our selves, and ourcivilization all need oxygen, water, and food to survive. Why is this important?Because what is good for any one of these is good for all, and, conversely, whatis damaging to one is damaging to all. This would seem to make great commonsense, but, while under the spell of widely held myth-perceptions, common senseis sadly all too uncommon. The good news within the bad news is that the direeffects of having taken ourselves out of the web of life are beginning to wakeus up.Alarming issues like global climate change and species loss are telling us thatno individual—no matter how physically or fiscally fit or how big the securitywall behind which we live—can survive if the species doesn’t. Polymath ArthurKoestler coined the word holon to describe the condition of “having parts” aswell as “being part” of something else.17[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en103] Humans are holons. We are made up ofparts—cells, tissues, and organs. Yet, we are parts in something larger. Webelong to communities, nations, and humanity. We even see ourselves as a cell ofMother Earth. The key to survival is thrival of the entire world system: healthycells, healthy humans, healthy planet. Put another way, without Earth we’renowhere.Therefore, what has been called the biological imperative seems to have twoequally important concerns: survival of the individual organism and survival ofthe species. Generally, survival of the species is expressed as the drive toreproduce. However, when the species, itself, is threatened by environmentalchanges, reproduction not only is not an option, it makes no sense. We have nowcreated an environment that, should we continue doing what we are currentlydoing, will no longer be able to sustain human life.This means that the new biological imperative for humankind necessarily involvesthe understanding that we’re all in this together and survival of the fittestmust now give way to “thrival of the fittingest.” That means we must adjusthuman activity to that which will cause the entire system to thrive. We now seemto have reached the level of complexity on the planet where seven billion humancells, operating unconsciously and using their energy at destructivecross-purposes, is no longer biologically functional.Like the single-cell organisms that utilized environmental awareness in order toemerge into more complex and efficient organisms, human society must adopt a newparadigm of social and economic relationships. Paradoxically, this new level ofcooperative awareness means maximum expression for the individual and maximumbenefit for the whole. Only the seemingly impossible reconciliation of thesemisperceived opposites can create the emergent human that spiritual teacherstell us is our destiny."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7MYTH-PERCEPTION THREE: IT’S IN YOUR GENES“The bad news is, there is no key to the Universe. The good news is, it has beenleft unlocked.”— Swami BeyondanandaWE FOUND THE KEY TO LIFE—BUT IT DOESN’T UNLOCK THE SECRETThe mission of modern science, as stated by Francis Bacon over 400 years ago, isto dominate and control Nature. Scholars were convinced that through anunderstanding of the material realm, humanity would acquire a mastery over thenatural environment. Therefore, it’s only natural that a materialist beliefsystem would look for the key to human life in the material worlditself—specifically in the gene.In search of that key, the science of genetics assumed a myopic mission toidentify the structure and behavior of the physical molecules that control thevehicular bodies we inhabit. Once endowed with an awareness of the mechanisms ofbiological heredity, science would be well on its way to dominion over Nature.Such an understanding would provide for the development of genetic engineeringand offer science an opportunity to control life itself, including human life.However, the same funny thing happened on the road to finding the key to lifethat happened on the way to establishing, with guaranteed certainty, the preceptthat all that matters is matter. The cosmic prankster leveled us with anothercosmic joke of global proportions. Just when we thought we had the key to lifein our hands, when we tried to unlock the secret, the key didn’t work.IS THE GENE THE KEY?When Darwin put forth his heredity-based theory of evolution, the premise thattraits were passed from parent to child made perfect practical sense to anyonewho had ever bred animals: like begets like. Because the Newtonian view at thetime emphasized the primacy of matter, it was seemingly assured that the secretof life would be encoded within the body’s own molecules.Based on the information available at the time, Darwin hypothesized thatparticulate gemmules, which programmed various physical and behavioral traits,were distributed throughout the body. During development, trait-attributinggemmules would somehow coalesce in the germ cells—eggs and sperm—which, then,enabled them to be passed on to the next generation.Newtonian materialistic logic implied that the germ cells carry physicaldeterminants within their molecules that control the traits of organisms derivedfrom those cells. Combine this concept with the basic Darwinian notion ofnatural selection—that is, the traits that endure tend to be those that enhancesurvival of the species—and post-Darwinian geneticists had a challenge on theirhands: to discover the physical elements that encode hereditary traits, todescribe how they work at the cellular level, and then to use that informationto design “designer humans.”It took nearly one hundred years of dedicated research efforts for geneticscientists to substantiate the speculations of Darwin in regard to heredity.German cytologist Walther Flemming made the initial advance by identifying thematerial elements of heredity in 1882. Flemming was a microscopist and the firstto describe mitosis, which is the process of cell division. In his study,Flemming emphasized the reproductive importance of thread-like filaments foundin the cell’s nucleus. Six years later, in 1888, German anatomist HeinrichWaldeyer coined the term chromosome to describe these heredity-conferringfilaments.Shortly after the turn of the 19th century, American geneticist and embryologistThomas Hunt Morgan became the first scientist to describe the rare event knownas a genetic mutation when he found in his cultures of red-eyed Drosophiliaflies a white-eyed fly that was able to produce similar offspring. From hisobservations on this and other mutant fruit flies, Morgan deduced that thegenetic factors that control hereditary traits are arranged along thechromosomes in a precise linear order.Further chemical analysis revealed that chromosomes are composed of proteins anddeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). However, the question as to whether the genetic keywas the protein or the DNA remained until 1944 when Rockefeller Instituteresearchers Oswald Avery, Colin McLeod, and Maclyn McCarty determinedempirically that DNA was the molecule that encoded hereditary traits.1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en104]Their experiment was both simple and elegant. They removed the chromosomes frombacteria species #1 and separated the DNA from the protein. Then they addedeither the isolated chromosomal protein or the chromosomal DNA into cultures ofbacteria species #2. The results showed that when the DNA of species #1 wasadded into cultures of species #2, that species began to express traits thatwere specifically characteristic of species #1. In contrast, the addition ofchromosomal proteins from species #1 did not have the ability to transform thetraits of recipient species #2. While this study was the first to distinguishDNA as the heredity-controlling molecule, it did not offer any insight into howDNA accomplished this feat.Interestingly, biologists were not at the forefront of the movement to uncoverlife’s biggest little secret. Insight into the nature of DNA’s mechanism wasoffered by the true mechanics of science—physicists. In his 1944 book, What isLife, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrodinger introduced the idea thatgenetic information could theoretically be encoded in the configuration ofmolecular bonds within crystalline molecules.2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en105]Schrodinger offered a well-reasoned theoretical prediction of what biologistsshould look for in their search for the genesis elements. Inspired bySchrodinger’smechanistic vision, molecular biologist James D. Watson andphysicist Francis Crick initiated a collaboration that would lead to one of themost important discoveries in the history of biology.GENETIC DETERMINISM: THE DOGMA THAT WOULDN’T HUNTIn 1953, Watson and Crick changed the course of human history when their article“Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids” was published in the prestigious Britishscientific journal Nature. Working with x-ray crystallography, they found thatthe DNA molecule was a long linear strand assembled from four different types ofmolecular building blocks called nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine,and cytosine, which are abbreviated as A, T, G, and C. They also found thatpairs of DNA strands assemble into double helices. Most importantly, theydiscovered that the sequence of A, T, G, and C bases along the length of the DNAmolecule represented a code used to synthesize the body’s protein molecules.A gene, therefore, represents a length of DNA code that contains the nucleotidebase sequences needed to make a specific protein. Protein molecules are thematerial building blocks of the cell and, as such, are responsible for anorganism’s physical and behavioral traits.Based on the nature of the DNA coding mechanism, Francis Crick posited theconcept known as the central dogma of molecular biology.3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en106] This central dogma, which is alsoreferred to as the primacy of DNA, defined the flow of information in biologicalsystems. The ATGC base sequences of DNA represent information—expressed asgenes—that encodes a protein’s structure. The cell makes the equivalent of aXerox copy of a gene in the form of another type of nucleic acid calledribonucleic acid (RNA).The RNA copy is the actual molecule physically employed to assemble the codeinto a protein molecule. Consequently, the information in the DNA is transcribedinto RNA and then the information in the RNA is translated into proteinmolecules. Crick’s central dogma mapped the flow of information in mostbiological systems as being one directional: from DNA to RNA to protein.Because the original patterns for the trait-providing protein’s structure areencoded in the DNA, this molecule was considered the primary determinant of ourbiological character. Hence, the central dogma, literally translates as DNAbeing the primary cause of our condition in life. Per Watson and Crick, thesecret of life was finally reduced to molecular cascades that originate in thecell’s nucleus by switching specific DNA genes on or off. This conclusionrepresented the epitome of biological reductionism—life emanates from materialgenes.The central dogma became one of the most important tenets of modern science, onethat significantly influenced the direction of genetic research for the next 50years. The belief in a physical Newtonian world fully convinced biologists thatlife and its mechanisms were clearly the result of material interactions, akinto the old story of moving, interlocking gears within wind-up mechanicalwatches. Consequently, even before Watson and Crick were born, science hadconcluded that an assembly of physical molecules controls life. The onlyremaining question was, “Which molecules would it be?” When Watson and Crickreported their DNA results, the decision was a slam dunk: DNA molecules controllife.Scientists unquestionably accepted the central dogma’s conclusions as truebecause they were already anticipating the result. Amazingly, biologistsimmediately adopted Crick’s hypothesis even though its validity was neverassessed. And it is both interesting and important to note that Crick referredto his DNA- RNA- Protein molecular information pathway hypothesis as dogma. Bydefinition, the word dogma represents a “belief based upon religious persuasionand not scientific fact.”By adopting an unverified dogma and making it the very foundation ofbiomedicine, scientific materialism officially and ironically slipped into therealm of religion! The question as to whether or not modern science representsscience or religion was now predicated on whether DNA actually controlled life.Before we go into every hotel room in the world and replace Gideon’s Bible witha book on genetics, let’s look into this question of the Primacy of DNA. Is itreally true?A key implication of Crick’s central dogma is that hereditary information onlyflows in one direction, from the DNA to the proteins—DNA-RNA- Protein—and nevergoes in the opposite direction, which means, according to Crick, protein cannotinfluence the structure and activity of the DNA code. Here’s the rub: the bodythat experiences life is made out of protein; because proteins cannot sendinformation about life’s experiences back to the DNA, then environmentalinformation cannot change genetic destiny. This means that genetic informationis disconnected from the environment.The information flow predicated by the central dogma concretized the notion ofgenetic determinism, a concept that has influenced the lives of everyone on thisplanet.Genetic determinism is the belief that genes control all of our traits—physical,behavioral, and emotional. It is the reason why we look for traits that run infamilies and why science keeps searching for genes that control this or thatparticular characteristic. Simply, it is the belief that our fates are locked inour genes and, because we cannot change our genes, we are truly, so they say,victims of our heredity.However, as time went on, new discoveries undermined the surety of that belief.In the late 1960s, University of Wisconsin geneticist Howard Temin was studyinghow tumor viruses hijack control of an infected cell’s genetic code. The viruswith which he was working contained only RNA as a genetic molecule.Consequently, when Temin published his research that suggested RNA informationcould flow backward and alter the host cell’s DNA code, he was ostracized anddeclared a heretic. In this case, the religious connotation of the heresy labelwas an appropriate epithet in that he was guilty of challenging the dogma.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en107]At the time, no one was prepared for the profound implications of Temin’sdiscovery, but we have since come to realize that the HIV viruses thatpresumably cause AIDS utilize the same heretical RNA genetic mechanism. Teminultimately shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1975 for discovering reversetranscriptase, the enzyme that copies RNA’s information into the DNA code.Temin’s work broke the backbone of Crick’s central dogma by proving thathereditary information flows in both directions: DNA sends information to RNA,and RNA can send information back into the DNA. The implication of Temin’s workis that through reverse processing, hereditary changes can be made by design orenvironmental influence and not only by accidental mutation as had beenpresumed.By 1990, another basic tenet of the central dogma and genetic determinism wasdeconstructed. As reported by Duke University biologist H. Frederik Nijhout,genes are not “self-emergent” and cannot “turn themselves on and off.”5[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en108] Nijhout’s article emphasized thatgenes are simply blueprints, and the concept that a blueprint has an on-and-offquality is absurd. Imagine being in an architect’s office, looking at ablueprint, and asking, “Is that blueprint on or off?” The appropriate questionis: “Is that DNA blueprint being read or not?”That’s because genes don’t read themselves, which means they are incapable ofactivating their own expression and are not self-emergent or self-actualizing.The next question then becomes, “What is responsible for reading a gene?” InNijhout’s words: “When a gene product is needed, a signal from its environment,not an emergent property of the gene itself, activates expression of that gene.”Simply put, environmental signals control gene activity.As we’ve already seen, biomedical sciences are being philosophically transformedby the new science of epigenetic control. The prefix epi-means “above,” so thenew science literally means control from above the genes. In other words,epigenetics describes how gene activity and cellular expression are ultimatelyregulated by information from the external field of influence rather than by theinternal matter of DNA.The inconvenient truth that genes do not control their own activity and thathereditary information does not flow in only one direction, as asserted by thecentral dogma, was established over 20 years ago. But, in spite of these fliesin the ointment, basic science textbooks, the media, and, especially, thepharmaceutical industry continue to resist movement away from the notion of thecentral dogma. They, thus, perpetuate the layperson’s view that genes controltheir lives. Apparently, if we continue to religiously feed it “dogma food,”even a dead dogma can be kept alive.Even though science has proven that the genetic-determinism dogma is invalid,mainstream media continues to focus on the concept that genes are controllingour lives. Every day, news articles claim that a gene has been found to controlthis trait or that trait. Anxious people queue up to glimpse their fate asoffered by the latest, greatest gene-chip technology as revealed by a read-outof their individual genome. The concept of genetic determinism is so resonantwith the prevailing dominant basal paradigm that even irrefutable scientificproof cannot dislodge it.THE SELFISH GENEThe widespread appeal for Richard Dawkins’ scientifically unsound book TheSelfish Gene is a prime example of the remaining popularity of the dead dogma.6[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en109] Dawkins’ theory that genes created usto carry them around and provide for their own reproduction is not only anabsurd parody on science fiction that takes logic to an illogical conclusion,but it also strains even the most severe reductionism by reducing organisms tomere biochemical vehicles designed to do the bidding of the genes.After all, as he argues, genes persist through generations but we humans onlylast a lifetime. Genes are the driver, and we are merely the car that getstraded in for a new model after we hit 5 million miles or 120 years, whichevercomes first. Dawkins’ premise is similar to the old notion that a chicken ismerely an egg’s way of making more eggs.But why the selfish gene? Because, maintains Dawkins, genes possess the samedrive to survive as we do, and they promote their own survival without regardfor the survival of the organism or even the species in which they reside. Theevolutionary adaptations that occur over generations, Dawkins says, are notdesigned for the survivability of the organism but to enhance the generativepower of the genes themselves. And even though those adaptations may or may notenhance the survival of the organism, to the selfish gene that doesn’t matter.And because the central dogma stipulates that everything emanates from thegenes, it stands to reason—unreasonable as this reason may be—that, in Dawkins’words, “We are born selfish.”7 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en110] Healso believes that natural selection favors those who cheat, lie, deceive, andexploit. Therefore, genes that cause children to behave immorally or amorallyhave an advantage in the gene pool. Altruism, he maintains, is basicallyunworkable because it interferes with natural selection. The same goes forsituations with child adoption, which he believes is “against the instincts andinterests of our selfish genes.”Fortunately, few people have bought into (Dawkins’) extreme and materialisticviews. Nonetheless, as we have seen with the Enron example, his view providedwhat was, for him, scientific fuel and rational justification for the mostruthless excesses of social, commercial, industrial, and governmental Darwinism.Dawkins, a self-declared atheist, believes in neither a caring Creator nor acaring human. Unlike many humanists who don’t believe in a personal God, hedismisses anything that is not purely deterministic, materialistic, and outrightselfish.If, according to Dawkins, survival equals success, then a metastasizing canceris highly successful. Until, of course, it kills the host. But, by then, if weare to believe that our destiny is controlled by DNA, the selfish genes thatcaused the cancer have successfully established their survival by incorporatingthemselves into the genetic lineage of their host’s offspring, in whom futurecopies of those genes are prepared to do the same thing again and again, thuscreating more genetic determinism—to a cancerous degree.From the standpoint of our planetary environment, it often appears that humanenterprise has come to resemble that cancer, replicating and reproducing to thedetriment of the environment as a whole. Now that we have developed spacetravel, we are preparing to survive by infecting other planetary systems whileleaving our dear, dying Earth behind.THE HUMAN GENOMEMeanwhile, the materialistic implications of genes as genesis led to one of themost ambitious scientific projects (and biggest disappointments) in the historyof biology: the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project (HGP) was launched in 1990 initially under the guidanceof James Watson who headed the project on behalf of the U.S. National Institutesof Health (NIH), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Ostensibly, at least in the public’s mind, HGP was an altruistic project withthree main objectives: to identify the genetic basis of all human traits, bothpositive and negative; to create a research database and tools for data analysisto be shared with the biotechnical industry and the private sector; and tofoster the development of new medical applications around the world.8[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en111]The thinking went like this. With over 100,000 proteins in the human body andwith a gene blueprint needed to make each protein, there had to be at least thatmany human genes, right? The masterminds behind the HGP believed that, by makinga compendium of all human genes, they could use that data to engineer a humanutopia.But lest Richard Dawkins be dismayed by the project’s apparent humanitariangoals, there was an ulterior motive to the project as well. Genetic scientistshad convinced venture capitalists that a fortune could be made by identifyingthe 100,000 genes that comprise the human genome. By patenting the nucleotidebase sequence for each gene and then selling that information to drug companiesfor use in drug discovery, the investment would reap phenomenal returns.But once again Nature, with cunning clarity, played a trick on those who wouldmine its secrets for financial gain.Based on the misassumption that genes control an organism’s traits, HGPprofiteers expected that the more complex organisms would possess a greaternumber of genes. Therefore, as a precursor to the project, scientists sequencedthe genes of simple organisms that have been traditionally employed in geneticresearch.They found that bacteria, Nature’s most primitive organisms, usually containedbetween 3,000 and 5,000 genes. Next, they discovered that a tiny, barely visibleround worm, Cenorhabditias elegans, an organism with only 1,271 cells whose nameis bigger than it is, had about 23,000 genes. So far, so good.Moving up the complexity ladder, they then studied the more evolved fruit flyand surprisingly found it had only 18,000 genes. This conclusion did not makesense. How could the considerably more complex fruit fly have fewer genes thanthe simpler round worm? Undaunted, they embarked on the Human Genome Project.When the complete human genome was assayed, the results were so underwhelmingthat what should have been a big fanfare came out as a weak bleating kazoo toot.We biologically complex humans, with our 50 trillion cells, have approximately23,000 genes, almost the same number of genes found in the lowly round worm.9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en112]The project’s results were released in 2003, and the event was, nonetheless,heralded as one of humanity’s greatest accomplishments. In truth, the failure tofind the anticipated 100,000-plus genes essentially led to a major downsizing ofthe bioengineering companies it spawned, Celera and Human Genome Sciences, andresignation of their CEOs.Dr. Paul Silverman, a pioneer in genome and stem cell research and an earlyadvocate and principal architect of the project, responded to the surprisingresults by concluding that science needed to rethink the notion of geneticdeterminism. Well, hello! Wrote Silverman: “The cell signaling process heavilydepends on extracellular stimuli to trigger nuclear DNA transduction.”10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en113] The short translation: It’s theenvironment, stupid.11 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en114]Despite the failure of the Human Genome Project to find 100,000 genes and thediscovery that genes are not self-emergent, the public continues to believe ingenetic determinism. While the gene-as-blueprint metaphor is taken for granted,no one seems to be asking the more pertinent question, “Who’s the contractor?”Or, just as importantly, “Where did the first selfish gene come from?” and “Whoor what programmed it to be selfish?”OF BABOONS AND BONOBOSAs with all the myth-perceptions, conventional wisdom has absorbed not only thenotion that people are ruled by DNA but, also that selfishness, violence, andaggression have been programmed into the human hard drive. These conclusionshave convinced humankind that the violence eroding our civilization isunavoidable because it is genetically encoded in the genome. After all, wehumans are just naked apes right?Actually, no. Two intriguing studies cast doubt on the conventionallyestablished notion about the nature of human nature. In 1983, Robert Sapolsky,an American primatologist, was five years into a study of baboons in the MasaiMara Reserve in Kenya when disaster struck. An outbreak of tuberculosis killedhalf the troop’s males. The source of the outbreak was a contaminated garbagedump, and the most aggressive and dominant males, those who were able tosuccessfully compete for the food, were the ones who died.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en115]Sapolsky decided to abandon that troop for another with a balanced male-femaleratio. Ten years later, he returned to the original research site and wassurprised to find that all of the original males, not only the ones who died,were gone, and that the new culture was radically different. In contests ofsupremacy, bigger baboons no longer bullied smaller ones but picked only onothers of the same size, and, unlike before, male baboons were less likely toattack the females.During his initial study of the group ten years earlier, Sapolsky found highlevels of hormones called glucocorticoids, which are the fight-or-flighthormones released in response to competition and aggression. However, Sapolsky’sassessments of subordinate males in this new version of the troop revealed thatthe animals expressed far fewer signs of physiologic stress and hadsignificantly lower levels of glucocorticoids.13[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en116]How did this new, more peaceful culture come about? Sapolsky hypothesizes that,with the old male leaders gone, the senior members of the troop were all female.These females then acculturated the younger males, apparently selecting thosethat exhibited less aggression and lower stress behaviors. Sapolsky has beenwatching the troop intently to see if invading or migrating baboon males willupset this delicate cultural balance, but so far the new culture has remainedintact.Regardless of whatever so-called selfish genes these primates may haveinherited, a change in environment initiated a change in culture that haspersisted, perhaps because it has contributed to a higher level offunctionality.An even more intriguing case involves bonobos, previously known as pygmychimpanzees, which are thought to be one of our closest primate relatives. Whileother species of chimps generally live in societies in which dominator malesbully smaller males and beat up females, bonobos enjoy a beautiful, livingexample of a make-love-not-war society. When faced with a potential conflict,bonobos engage in sexual activity that releases tension and reinforces safetyand friendship. Although male-female sexuality is most common, polymorphous andpolyamorous sexual activity also occurs. While chimpanzee males will literallykiss and make up after fighting, bonobos kiss before and, thus, prevent fightingfrom happening in the first place. And interestingly, even though bonobos havemuch more sex than their chimp cousins, their birth rate remains stable.Male bonding among chimps and female bonding among bonobos provide anotherinteresting contrast. In both species, adolescent females migrate to a newtroop. Bonobo newcomer females immediately find one or two older females withwhich to rub genitalia, a behavior that creates a lasting bond between femalesin the troop and which encourages them to join together to prevent malebullying. In contrast, in conventional chimpanzee troops, bonding occursprimarily among males who then gang up on females, who are generally smallerthan males. In bonobo troops, males and females are of comparable size, a factorthat might also influence their gender equality.However, those who study bonobos believe that environmental factors have keptthis Garden of Eden chimp culture intact. As Dutch psychologist andprimatologist Frans de Waal, author of Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape,/ suggests, thebonobos have never left the protection of the forest.14[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en117] Like other chimps, bonobos areomnivores that hunt and kill small animals. But unlike the other chimps, theyare blessed with what another researcher, Gottfried Hohmann, called “bonobopower bars.” In their natural habitat, bonobos find an abundant herb, haumanialiebrechtsiana, a high-protein plant that has defied Malthus by persistingthrough hundreds upon hundreds of generations of hungry bonobos.15[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en118]Most chimps have to work hard to secure their food because vegetation in mostchimp forests is high in tannins and other toxins designed to protect the plantsfrom being eaten to death. Amidst the abundance of their power bars, bonoboswaste little time securing food or having to fight over resources.So what can humans learn from bonobos? While the idea of making love in the faceof conflict is intriguing—it would certainly change our courtrooms, not tomention hockey games!—the real message is this: when resources are abundant,fighting becomes less necessary. And when fighting decreases, resources becomemore abundant.This is an especially important insight in a world that spends more than onetrillion dollars a year on weaponry that could be beaten into plowshares. As wewill see later, when resources are diverted from protection to growth, theresult is a big boost in health and prosperity—both within society and withinthe body.Other questions we need ask ourselves are: If the peaceful bonobos can live inabundance and balance, and a troop of otherwise violent baboons can find theyenjoy peace more than war, what can we sentient humans, who have far moreresources at our disposal, accomplish? Are we going to continually assumepowerlessness and deny responsibility while blaming dire personal and worldconditions on selfish genes? Or are we willing to use our intelligenceintelligently?It would be sad, indeed, for creationists and evolutionists alike, if ourprimate cousins actually evolve past us!IT’S NOT THE KARMA, IT’S THE DRIVERIt seems that every week a medical article or study links one disease or anotherto a genetic defect. The cancer gene, the Alzheimer’s gene, the Parkinson’s geneare notions that feed the prevailing, stubborn belief that genetic determinismdetermines our fate. But when we delve deeper, we find that a relatively smallpercentage of illness actually can be attributed to genetic anomalies. Even ascancer researchers seek a magic bullet at the genetic level, the National CancerInstitute has determined that at least 60 percent of cancers originate fromenvironmental causes.16 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en119]Probing deeper yet, we find that even when a close correlation exists between anenvironmental factor and a disease, relatively few of those exposed to theenvironmental factor actually contract the disease. A study some years agorevealed that when chronically exposed to asbestos, 1 in 1,000 people contractedmesothelioma, a deadly form of cancer. While this is an alarmingly high ratecompared to the general population, the unasked questions are: What about theother 99.9 percent who are exposed but don’t get the disease? What, if anything,are they doing or not doing that keeps them healthy? What other factors areinvolved in the expression of disease?Modern medical science seems curiously incurious about the intangible andinvisible characteristics of illness and healing. Thanks to 300 years ofprogramming and the effects of the central dogma on modern medicine, we havecome to see ourselves as biochemical robotic vehicles. When something is amiss,when we are experiencing symptoms, we cruise over to our local medical mechanicwho tells us to stick out our tongue and say “aaah” and then takes a peek underour hood.As Fritjof Capra points out in his book The Turning Point, mechanical medicalpractice generally consists of the physician’s version of the 3 Rs—repair,replace, or remove.17 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en120] Indeed, thehistory of modern biochemical medicine is founded on that mechanical metaphor.Ever since Descartes proclaimed that the body is a machine, even to the pointwhere he insisted that animals don’t suffer during vivisection experiments andlikened their cries to “the creaking of a wheel,” we have been under the sway ofinfluence that says medicine has more to do with the parts than the whole.While ancient Chinese medicine considers the heart to be the seat of the souland Ayurvedic tradition sees that organ as the arbiter of Heaven and Earth,modern medicine remains satisfied with the antediluvian definition by theprominent Renaissance physician William Harvey that the heart is a mechanicalpump. Twentieth century scientific philosophers, such as British biochemistJoseph Needham, who said, “Man is a machine or nothing at all,” and German-bornphysiologist and biologist Jacques Loeb, who added, “Living organisms arechemical machines,” reinforced the perception of the body as a physicalmechanism.18 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en121]The science of epigenetics recognizes that the environment, not the DNA in thenucleus, determines the actions of the cell. Information from the environment istranslated into biological responses via the action of the cell membrane, whichacts as the cell’s skin as well as its brain.19[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en122] Interestingly, the cell membrane ismore accurately a “crystal semiconductor with gates and channels.” Those wordsalso define a computer chip, which reminds us that both computers and cells areprogrammable. And—drum roll, please—for each, the programmer is always outsidethe mechanism! So, who or what is the biological programmer? Who or what is thegenius behind the genes? Maybe the problem isn’t with the karma but with thedriver.Let’s say you have a standard shift car for sale. Someone unaccustomed todriving a stick shift buys it, and you watch the car jerk up and down the streetas he drives away. A week later, the fellow calls you back and says, “Hey, thatcar you sold me has a bad clutch!” You tell him to take it to the “doctor,” atan auto repair shop. “Yep,” the mechanic tells him, “you have a bad clutch. Wehave to do surgery, a clutch replacement.” The clutch transplant operation issuccessful. The vehicle’s new owner drives off with the car bucking and lurchingas before. Lo and behold, it isn’t weeks before he’s back in the repair shopclaiming that new clutch doesn’t work!“Hmm,” says the mechanic, “your car appears to have CCD; that’s short forChronic Clutch Dysfunction.” He offers the owner a prescription for a new clutchto be refilled every two months. Thus the mechanic ignores the role of thedriver and attributes the dysfunction to the vehicle’s defective nature!Now, consider that this is exactly how allopathic medicine perceives humandisease—as an expression of an inherent physical defect in the body, most likelydue to a genetic mutation. This diagnosis ignores the role of the body’s driver,the mind.Every motor vehicle bureau in every state has files and files of accidentreports. In the space where the officer has to indicate either mechanicalfailure or driver error as the responsible agent, which one do you think ischecked 95 percent of the time? Yep, you’re right. It’s driver error.To extend the metaphor, do you think it might be worthwhile to offer drivertraining to each human “driving their own karma?” Perhaps a true “healthy caringsystem” would focus more on driver education than on having to clear away thedebris from tragic, yet avoidable, accidents.So what are the implications for a planetary spontaneous remission? Simply this.We humans have a lot more responsibility—the ability to respond—than we allowourselves to believe. The programmer of the field, the genius behind the genes,is none other than our own mind—our own thoughts and beliefs.To illustrate the extent of the invisible power of the mind, consider thisextreme and amazing story. In 1952, Dr. Albert Mason, a young anesthesiologistin Great Britain, was working with a surgeon, a Dr. Moore, on a 15-year-old boywhose leathery skin was covered with so many warts it looked more like anelephant’s hide than human skin. Moore was trying to graft clear patches of skinfrom the boy’s chest to other parts of his body. Because Mason and other doctorshad successfully used hypnosis to rid other patients of warts, Mason askedMoore, “Why don’t you try hypnotherapy?” The surgeon replied sarcastically, “Whydon’t you?” So Mason did.20 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en123]Mason’s first hypnosis session focused on one arm. When the boy was in ahypnotic trance, Mason told him that the skin on that arm would heal and turninto healthy, pink skin. When the boy came back a week later, Mason wasgratified to see that the arm looked healthy. But when Mason brought the boyaround to Moore, the surgeon’s eyes became wide with astonishment when he sawthe boy’s arm.It was then that Moore told Mason the boy was suffering, not from warts, butfrom an incurable and lethal genetic disease called congenital ichthyosiserythroderma. By reversing the symptoms using only the power of the mind, Masonand the boy had accomplished what had until that time been consideredimpossible. Mason continued the hypnosis sessions with further stunning results,and the boy, who had been mercilessly teased in school because of his grotesqueskin, returned to his classes with healthy skin and went on to lead a normallife.Mason published his case study in the British Medical Journal, one of theworld’s most widely read medical journals.21[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en124] Word of his success spread, and Masonbecame a magnet for patients suffering from the rare, heretofore-incurable andlethal disease. But hypnosis was, in the end, not a cure-all. Mason treated manyother ichthyotic patients, but he was never able to replicate the results he hadhad with the boy.Mason attributed his failure to his own belief about the treatment. After thefirst patient, Mason was fully aware that he was treating what everyone in themedical establishment knew to be a congenital, incurable disease. Mason tried topretend that he was upbeat, but he was not able to replicate his cocky attitudeas a young physician who thought he was treating a bad case of warts. As he toldthe Discovery Health Channel in regard to his later patients, “I was acting.”22[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en125]When we consider the astounding power of belief—and disbelief—to affect physicalconditions, we must ask: “Might beliefs held in the mind be an area of untappedhealing potential?” Put another way: “Could the power of belief produce resultswithout costly drug trials, hugely expensive hospital facilities, or evenmedical insurance?”As we will see, there are those who say that this potential for impacting theinvisible field is inherent in human culture and might even be in—are you readyto believe it?—our genes!The factor that has kept us from accessing this power is the same thing that haskept us from other transformational potentials: a false belief that healingpower lies outside of ourselves. Those who benefit from our powerlessnessreinforce this belief. And who might they be? Well, here’s a hint:pharmaceuticals are a $600 billion a year industry.Now that we understand there is, indeed, a playing field that most definitelyimpacts the material world and now that we realize that the spontaneousremission of our planet Earth involves a shift of our own mission from survivalto thrival, we also see that we have the power and the responsibility to bringthese changes about.We have met the savior and He or She is us!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8MYTH-PERCEPTION FOUR: EVOLUTION IS RANDOMI believe we were created to evolve.Otherwise Jesus would have said, “Now,don’t do a thing until I get back!”— Swami BeyondanandaTHE FALL AND RISE OF JEAN BAPTISTE DE LAMARCKPerhaps you remember the name Jean Baptiste Lamarck from high school biology,forever associated with the notion that giraffes developed long necks because oftheir desire to reach leaves and fruit in tall trees. The notion that primitiveorganisms have a consciousness through which they can influence their ownevolution is ridiculous and makes Lamarck seem like a fool. But making Lamarckout to be a fool and discrediting his Bible-challenging heretical claims wasprecisely the intent of naturalist and zoologist Baron Georges Cuvier, theChurch’s and France’s foremost scientist. In 1829, he fabricated this slanderousand cruel postmortem assessment of Lamarck’s theory specifically to erase hiswork.Jean Baptiste de Lamarck was born in France in 1744. After being schooled at aJesuit seminary, he served in the French army for seven years. He left the armyas a result of an infection, attempted to study medicine, and, subsequently,found work as a bank clerk in Paris. There, Lamarck met the eminent philosopherJean-Jacques Rousseau, who sparked in him a lifelong interest in botany and verylikely infected him with the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment.After laboring ten years in his spare time on a three-volume book on the floraof France, Lamarck won election to the preeminent L’Academie Francaise, thenation’s academy of science. Although he was almost a commoner—an upper classcitizen with no money and, consequently, of low standing—Lamarck wassubsequently appointed Royal Botanist during the reign of Louis XVI. In the wakeof the French Revolution, which ended in 1799 when Napoleon Bonaparte tookpower, Lamarck was put in charge of transforming the deposed king’s formalgardens, the Jardin de Roi (The Garden of the King) into a public botanicalpark, renamed the Jardin des Plantes (The Garden of the Plants).The French Revolution offered Europe a brief window during which Nature becameking and France became a republic. In an environment free of Church dogma,Lamarck’s ideas about evolution and Nature’s impulse toward perfection gainedprominence. “Nature,” he wrote, “in producing in succession every species ofanimal, and beginning with the least perfect or simplest to end her work withthe most perfect, has gradually complicated their structure.”1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en126]Unfortunately for Lamarck, his ideas about evolutionary progress being part ofthe course of Nature had dangerous social implications. If Nature couldprogress, then it was natural for the lower classes of humanity to progress aswell. So, when the French Revolution failed and King Louis XVIII restored themonarchy, Lamarck found himself out of favor with the Church and the rulingclass, which didn’t care for Lamarck’s upstart notion at all. This ideologicaland theological disagreement was one reason why academic rival Baron Cuvierpurposely distorted and misquoted Lamarck’s work on evolution.Other reasons were founded on clashes of personality and ego. At an earliertime, when Napoleon Bonaparte ousted the upper class, Cuvier, an aristocrat, hadbeen demoted to a subservient position beneath the socially low-ranked Lamarck.Yet, Lamarck used his influence to assist Cuvier in getting established inParis, a favor that Cuvier apparently found difficult to swallow.After Napoleon’s defeat, the disgruntled Cuvier was returned to power as head ofthe French Academy, where he became known as a reputation maker by virtue of hisfrequent work as a eulogist of departed Academy members. While his many othereulogies were fair and kind, toasting the contributions of his fellows, Cuvierseized the opportunity of Lamarck’s death to not only roast his colleague but toslanderously destroy both the man and his new science of evolution. Cuvier’seulogy was so unflattering and filled with animosity toward the lower classesthat the Academy refused to let him present or publish it. However, an editedversion of it was later unveiled in 1832, three years after Lamarck’s death andsix months after Cuvier’s.2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en127] But, evenunder those less-than-scientific circumstances, Cuvier’s assessment of Lamarckand his ideas has ever since been cited as the document that justifiesportraying Lamarck as a buffoon.Had Lamarck been alive to defend himself, he would have emphasized thatevolution was based on an instructive cooperative interaction among organisms inthe biosphere that enables life forms to survive by adapting to changes in adynamic environment. This becomes obvious when we observe the perfectrelationship between organisms and their surroundings: furry polar bears do notlive in the sweltering tropics, and delicate orchids don’t grow in the frigidarctic. Indeed, Lamarck suggested that evolution was the result of organismsacquiring and passing on environment-induced adaptations needed to sustain theirsurvival in an ever-changing world.Interestingly, the misperception of Lamarck’s work was predicated upon Cuvier’sintentional misinterpretation of the French word besoin, which can mean either“need” or “desire.” Lamarck maintained that evolutionary variations arise inNature through the besoin—the biological need or imperative—of an organism tosurvive. But Cuvier wrote that Lamarck had used besoin to mean desire, as in“animals evolve because they wish to evolve.”3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en128]Cuvier claimed that Lamarck believed birds have wings and feathers because theywish to fly, that aquatic birds have webbed feet because they wish to swim, andthat wading birds have long legs because they wish to keep their bodies dry.This misuse of besoin has led to the often-reproduced cartoon of a fish at theshore with a thought balloon above its head that reads: “I wish I had legs.”In light of Cuvier’s denigration, Lamarck’s ideas concerning evolution wereridiculed—no card-carrying scientist could accept the notion that fish havethoughts of evolving. Cuvier not only destroyed Lamarck’s reputation as thedistinguished founder of the sciences of biology and evolution; his slanderouseulogy is still used by contemporary biologists to attack Lamarckian evolutiontheory and its followers.Ironically, more than 175 years after Lamarck’s death, science is finding thatevolutionary intention may be a lot closer to the truth than Lamarck everimagined. But, between then and now, other scientists of their day also managedto push Lamarck and his ideas further into the background.Three decades after Cuvier’s nefarious eulogy, Charles Darwin published TheOrigin of Species and introduced his version of evolution in which he claimedhereditary alterations arise from random chance. Consequently, Darwin’s theorygenerated another hotly contested attack. The issue was not raised by acreationist this time, but by a fellow evolutionist.In staunch defense of Darwin’s theory of random evolution, German biologistAugust Weismann helped propel Lamarck further into obscurity with his biasedeffort to disprove Lamarck’s theory that organisms evolve by adaptation.Weismann mated male and female mice whose tails he had removed, arguing that ifLamarck’s adaptive theory were correct, the offspring would also be tailless.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en129]The first generation of mice was born with tails, so Weismann used those progenyand repeated the experiment for 21 more generations. During five years ofexperiments, not a single tailless mouse was born. Now, anyone who has bredDoberman pinschers knows that clipped tails or ears do not show up in theoffspring, no matter how many generations get clipped, which simply means thatNature never says, “Okay, you win. From now on, no tails.”Unfortunately for Lamarck and the rest of us, too, Weismann’s conclusions werescientifically unjustified for several reasons. First, Lamarck suggested thatevolutionary changes could take “immense periods of time,” perhaps thousands ofyears. Weismann’s five-year experiment was clearly not long enough to eitherprove or disprove Lamarck’s theory. Second, Lamarck never claimed that everychange would take hold. Instead, he said organisms hang on to traits, such astails, that support survival.Although Weismann didn’t think the mice in his experiment needed tails, hedidn’t ask the mice if they thought tails were relevant for their survival!Nevertheless, Weismann’s experiments bolstered Darwinian theory and ultimatelyserved to debunk Lamarck, relegating him to the historical joke pile beforeslipping out of public awareness.As a result of Weismann’s studies, biologists began to dismiss the environmentas an influential factor in both genetic mutations and the path of evolution.However, in light of recent advances in epigenetics and adaptive mutations,Lamarck’s teleological, goal-oriented view of evolution is now proving to bemore valid than once perceived. Yes, research still reveals that evolutionutilizes a random process to rewrite genes, as Darwin and neo-Darwinists havemaintained. However, as we will see, randomness occurs within a context. Everyorganism on the planet is part of a complex and, some say, intentional processto maintain balance in the environment.RANDOM MUTATION? NO DICE!At the time they lived, neither Lamarck nor Darwin was able to validate histheory on evolution and heredity because the necessary scientific technologywasn’t available then. But, as later generations of scientists discovered and aswe shall soon see, evolution actually embodies both Lamarckism and Darwinism.The experimental science of genetics was officially launched in 1910, a centuryafter Lamarck posited his theory. It was then that Thomas Hunt Morgan discoveredthat a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among a population of red-eyed flies wasable to reproduce true copy white-eyed offspring as described in the previouschapter.Through his research on mutations, Morgan established that trait-controllinggenes were discrete physical elements within the chromosome. While environmentalinfluences, such as radiation or toxins, could induce genetic mutations, Morganconcluded that environmental insults apparently did not control or influence theoutcome of such events. More sophisticated research protocols later led to thebelief that genetic changes were unpredictable—just as Darwin had predicted.In 1943, studies on bacterial genetics by researchers Salvador Luria and MaxDelbruck appeared to prove, once and for all, that mutations were purely randomevents.5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en130] Starting with a geneticallyidentical population of bacteria, they grew large numbers of colonies over manygenerations in a nutrient-rich broth. They then inoculated an equal number ofthese bacteria into a large number of culture dishes. Into these identicalcultures, they added a solution of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infectand eventually kill bacteria. While this process leads to almost certain deathfor the bacteria, virus-resistant bacteria occasionally survived and developedinto colonies.To determine whether these life-sustaining mutations appeared in a purely randomfashion or if they were the result of a directed cellular response to thethreatening conditions, Luria and Delbruck assessed the distribution ofsurviving bacterial colonies among all the culture dishes. They reasoned that ifthese mutations were produced by a bacterial-adaptive response to the newenvironmental conditions, a similar and consistent number of surviving colonieswould appear in each of the dishes. In contrast, if the mutations were theresult of random processes then the number of surviving colonies would vary fromone dish to another.The results revealed that the number of surviving colonies differedsignificantly from one petri dish to the next, suggesting that mutationsoccurred in a random manner completely independent of environmental stimuli.Bacteria fortunate enough to survive acquired the right mutation solely by theluck of the draw. Over the next 45 years, many similar experiments confirmingLuria and Delbruck’s findings led science to adopt the assumption that allmutations were random events with regard to fitness.Based upon these observations, science adopted the seemingly iron-clad tenet:when mutations occur, they are purely random and unpredictable events and havenothing to do with any need the organism might have in the present or in thefuture. Because evolution appeared to be driven solely by mutations, scienceconcluded that randomly driven evolution has no purpose. The idea fit well withscientific materialism’s belief in a purely materialistic Universe and helpedshift the focus from intentional creation to merely a “throw of genetic dice.” Ahuman being is just another, among the “accidental tourists” who materialized inthe biosphere through random acts of heredity.However, in 1988, internationally prominent geneticist John Cairns challengedscience’s established belief in random evolution. Cairns’ novel research onbacteria, facetiously titled “The origin of mutants,” was published in theprestigious British journal Nature.6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en131]He chose bacteria with a crippled gene that made a defective version of theenzyme lactase needed to digest lactose, a sugar present in milk. He theninoculated these lactase-deficient bacteria into cultures in which the onlynutrient was lactose. Unable to metabolize this nutrient, the bacteria couldneither grow nor reproduce, so no colonies were expected to appear in any of theexperiments. Yet, surprisingly, a large number of cultures expressed growth ofbacterial colonies.Sampling the bacteria that he started with, Cairns found that mutated forms didnot exist in the original inoculum. Consequently, he concluded that lactase genemutations followed, not preceded, their exposure to the new environment. Unlikethe experiments of Luria and Delbruck, which relied on viruses killing thebacteria almost instantly, Cairns’ experiment starved bacteria slowly. In otherwords, Cairns gave the stressed bacteria sufficient time to engage and activateinnate mutation-producing mechanisms in order to survive.In Cairns’ study, life-sustaining mutations appeared to arise as a directresponse to a traumatic environmental crisis. Interestingly, further assaysrevealed that only the genes associated with lactose metabolism were affected.In addition, out of five possible different mutation mechanisms, all of thesurviving bacteria expressed the exact same type of mutation. Clearly, theresults do not support the assumption of totally random mutations andpurposeless evolution!Cairns referred to this newly discovered mechanism as directed mutation. But thevery idea that environmental stimuli could feed back into an organism and directa rewriting of genetic information was an abomination to the central dogma, andthe response from conventional science was swift and hostile. Both Nature andthe American journal Science published editorials raging against Cairns’findings. The Science editorial title, which appeared in large bold font,proclaimed “A Heresy in Evolutionary Biology.” This was a clear indication thatthe white-coated priests of scientific materialism were ready to burn Cairns atthe stake. Nobody messes with the dogma!7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en132]Over the next decade, other researchers replicated Cairns’ results, which shouldhave increased the credibility of his work. However, the scientific communitystill considered his notion to be shocking and unacceptable. As a result,leading genetic researchers softened directed mutation to adaptive mutation thenrelegated it to beneficial mutation. Furthermore, science challenged Cairns toexplain the mechanism through which mutations, whether labeled directive,adaptive, or beneficial, could occur in the first place.Conventional science held that mutations only occurred as a result of copyingaccidents during the reproduction process. The billions of nucleic acid basesthat comprise the genetic code have to be precisely copied so that each of thetwo resulting daughter cells will inherit a complete genome. However, theduplication process is fraught with numerous opportunities through which errorscan be introduced.In a sense, copying the DNA is akin to monks copying the Bible by hand beforethe advent of the printing press. Imagine how easily, among those millions ofwords, one could be misspelled. Imagine how a failure to include the word notwould transpose a meaning.Simple errors in transcription can completely change the meaning of the entiretext. We’ve all heard the story of the monk who looks up from the scrollsvisibly shaken and cries, “Oops! It says celebrate, not celibate.”Fortunately, Nature had already considered that possibility and ingeniouslybuilt into the genes a DNA-proofreading mechanism that repairs misread DNAsequences. If, by chance, a copying error should sneak past this repairmechanism, it would result in an altered blueprint, and rightfully be recognizedas a random mutation. Darwinian theory emphasizes that evolution is ultimatelyderived from such accidental alterations in the DNA code.But in Cairns’ experiments, the original bacteria were unable to metabolize thelactose nutrient. They, therefore, lacked the necessary building blocks andmetabolic energy needed to drive their normal reproduction processes.Consequently, these bacteria were not able to save their lives through therandom mutation associated with conventional DNA copying errors. As a result,Cairns’ starving bacterial cells apparently mutated their genes through acompletely different mechanism than the one known to science. While we’d behard-pressed to credit bacteria with consciousness, there seems to be some formof proactive, innate intelligence at work enabling them to rapidly adapt to achanging environment—per Lamarck.We now know that stressed, non-dividing bacteria can purposely engage a uniqueerror-prone DNA-copying enzyme to make mutated copies of genes associated with aparticular dysfunction. Through this process of generating genetic variants, theorganism attempts to create a more functional gene that will allow it toovercome the environmental stressors. Think of this mutation mechanism as asloppy photocopy machine that intentionally makes mistakes.Using this DNA-synthesizing enzyme to produce a large number of randomly mutatedgene copies enables cells to accelerate their mutation rate in order to enhancetheir survival. Referred to as somatic hypermutation— rapid or excessivealterations of the genes in cells that form the physical body—this mechanism,which purposefully generates random mutations, represents the Darwinian part ofthe process.The stressed bacteria end up with a large number of duplicated genes, eachexpressing a different variation of the genetic code. When one of these genevariants is able to produce a protein product that can effectively resolve theorganism’s stress, the bacterium cuts the original ineffective gene out of itschromosome and replaces it with the newly minted version. This is the Lamarckianpart of the mechanism, the step in which an instructive interaction between theenvironment and the cell leads to the selection of the best version of the newgene.Cairns’ work and subsequent studies introduced the reality that organisms notonly adapt to an environment, but that they intentionally change their geneticsto enhance the adaptation of future generations. In other words, science iscoming to realize that evolution is not simply an accident of blindly rollingDarwinian dice but a coordinated Lamarckian dance between an organism and itsenvironment, a dynamic process in which organisms can continuously adapt tostressful circumstances.Technologists have already taken advantage of this mutation mechanism byengineering bacteria to digest oil spills or to extract certain minerals fromraw ore. Meanwhile, medical science has also been confounded and outmaneuveredby this same genetic mechanism that enables microbes to learn how to becomeresistant to our most powerful antibiotics.So in regard to the question, “Does evolution occur by intention, or doesevolution occur by chance?” the answer is a resounding “yes!” As with so much weare now learning, polar opposites, such as intention and chance, appear tooperate simultaneously. Without getting too anthropomorphic—bacteria hate itwhen we do that—it would seem that bacteria have an intention to survive.In fact, all life forms exhibit this inherent drive, which biologists identifiedas the will to survive. At the cellular level, this survival mechanism canunleash a cascade of random mutations until one hits the jackpot. No matter howmany times these Cairnsian experiments have been repeated, researchers havefound no consistent pattern within the DNA sequences of the successfulmutations. So, in that regard, the process is random.And, yet, it’s not. Consider the interesting parallel between the process ofhypermutation and the human endeavor of brainstorming. Imagine a group trying tocome up with a name for a new product. By the rules of brainstorming, ideas arethrown out at random and put up on a board without editing or judgment. Thebrainstorming process allows for many supposedly wrong answers before someonesuggests a name that resonates with everyone. Even though no one knows if five,ten, or one hundred ideas will be listed before the right one shows up, thiseureka! is the expected—or intended—eventuality. And numerous differentbrainstorming groups, given the same task, will likely each take a differentrandom path to ultimately reach the best possible resolution.So, yes, evolution is a random process, but the randomness seems to have apurposeful destination. How do we know? Because in the case of the bacteria,when the appropriate adaptive mutation is found, the process stops. It’s likethe witticism: why do you always find a lost item in the last place you look?Because when you find it, you stop looking.IN PRAISE OF TYPING MONKEYSApplying pure randomness to the origin of life only makes sense in a purelymaterial world where the notion of causative fields is ruled irrelevant. In thisregard, recall the difference in appearance between iron filings haphazardlystrewn on a sheet of paper and the patterned arrangement of those influenced byan invisible magnetic field. Is it possible that a similar influential field isinvolved with shaping single-celled organisms into elegant and coherent formssuch as a tree, a dog, or one of us? Who or what told those cells what to do inorder to do that?As we’ve already learned, physics acknowledges that the nonmaterial field is, infact, the sole governing agency of matter, which, of course, includes cells andpeople. So what, or possibly who, governs the field? Perhaps, as the greatestminds in quantum physics have historically remarked, we will soon discover thatthe Universe, like Descartes, thinks and, therefore, is. Perhaps we will come torealize that thoughts—more than inherited traits—do, indeed, manifest ourreality.However, for people who don’t consider themselves creationists, questionsregarding the origin of life and the biosphere must be predicated on thedynamics of a random Universe in which we humans somehow acquired our currentform purely by chance. Unfortunately, dogmatic worship of the god ofmeaninglessness is just as disempowering as dogmatic belief in a God who isall-controlling. In either case, we surrender our power to something completelyoutside ourselves.In a Universe derived from randomness and meaninglessness, the selfish genewould surely thrive. Why? First, because the moral authority inherent in aloving, harmonic presence in the Universe would be missing. Second, because, ifthere is no purpose to anything, it would certainly be permissible to createyourself as number one in order to justify treating everyone and everything elseas number two.Having bought into the ultimate realization that our Universe is an impersonalmachine and that we were assembled accidentally, it is no wonder humans seem sodocile when the machine commands that we compete, consume, be quiet, and obey.By telling ourselves, subliminally and audibly, that life is meaningless, weallow machine consciousness to transform our desire for personal improvementinto some sort of naïve idealism. Over the past two postmodern generations,apathy and cynicism have become hip. These attitudes have squelched our questfor betterment, kept us from awakening to our positive role in the co-evolutionof the planet, and blinded us from discerning the very patterns that will helpus thrive.WHEN RANDOMNESS MEETS DETERMINISMWe are now coming to realize that many of our fundamental cherished beliefs arenot only false, but are blatantly destructive. This is especially true for theneo-Darwinist assumption that biology and evolution are based purely upon randommutation or chance, a belief that is disheartening and inaccurate. The fact thatorganisms, such as Cairns’ bacteria, can engage adaptive mutation mechanisms inorder to survive in stressful environments implies the notion of a purposefulevolution; that is, organisms will adapt in every way possible, includingrewriting their genetic code. Consequently, as Lamarck envisioned, evolutionaryprocesses are intimately connected with an organism’s ability to activelyrespond and adapt to dynamic changes within its environment.Therefore, we must ask, “Can we gain insight into the future of evolution?” At atime when civilization’s future is blighted by the prospects of impendingextinction, historical observation of our evolutionary path might forewarn usthat we are already forearmed in our drive to survive.But whether or not we choose to bear those arms depends on our belief in eitheran underlying order that shapes the Universe or in randomly appearingenvironmental dynamics, such as the collision of stars, Category 5 hurricanes,and the flight path of airborne pathogens.We suggest that the answer is a balance of both.By definition, a random Universe would evolve by chance or accident and its fatewould consequently be totally unpredictable. The primacy of chance in shapingour existence is the essence of neo-Darwinian evolution theory. However, noteverything that looks random is random—it may be chaotic. Random systems andchaotic systems outwardly resemble one another, so much so that we have come touse randomness and chaos as synonyms when, in fact, they are antonyms. Randomsystems operate by chance, while chaotic systems, although appearing random, areactually based on an underlying organization.The difference between randomness and chaos is readily distinguished in thefollowing scenario: imagine looking down on the main floor of New York’s GrandCentral Station at the busiest time of day. Throngs of people seem to behurrying and scurrying in a random fashion, and yet, with very few exceptions,each individual has a specific destination. Had we access to the universalintelligence to read each person’s mind, we would understand the purposefulnessbehind each of their stops, starts, and changes in direction. While appearingrandom, the traffic flow is actually chaotic because every individual’s movementis based on an inherent plan.However, imagine what would happen if, in the midst of that rush hour traffic,someone were to yell, “FIRE!” At that moment, chaos would instantly transforminto random pandemonium as people fled in all directions without really knowingwhere they’re going.The terms randomness and chaos, along with order, can be used to describeorganizational complexity within a system. As illustrated below, randomness andorder represent polar extremes with chaos as the midpoint of organizationalstructure. In this continuum of life, randomness and order are on the extremes, with chaosas the midpoint. On a scale of predictability, uncertainty relates torandomness, and determinismrelates to order.019 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_019_r1.gif]Random systems are rife with uncertainty and, therefore, cannot support lifebecause they lack the organization needed to provide a regulated and integratedphysiology.At the other extreme, life cannot arise out of a rigid crystalline systembecause it does not offer the dynamism necessary for living organisms. As withGoldilocks and the Three Bears, life requires a system that is just right—andfinds it in the fertile predictability of dynamic, controllable chaos.The ability to predict the fate of a system is based on the nature of itsorganization. When we are aware of underlying patterns that shape highly orderedsystems, we can accurately predict the system’s past and future conditions. Inrandom systems, however, the inherently erratic behavior makes accurateprediction difficult, if not impossible. The organization of a system and,consequently, the ability to predict its fate are predicated on themechanics—the physics—that govern its operation. Systems that employ Newtonianphysics feature determinism and order, while quantum mechanics-based systemsintroduce uncertainty into the equation.In contrast to both of these, chaotic systems are characterized by both orderand disorder. Consequently, they are shaped by Newtonian physics and quantummechanics. As emphasized in Chapter 5, Only Matter Matters, the adoption ofquantum mechanics into the knowledge of science did not negate Newtonian physicsbut, rather, subsumed it. In regard to whether Newtonian or quantum mechanicsinfluences chaotic systems, it is not a matter of either-or, it is a matter ofboth-and.Perhaps you are beginning to recognize a recurring theme regarding the newawareness offered by science. Previously mentioned polar perspectives, such asintention and chance, Darwinian and Lamarckian theory, matter and spirit, and,now, Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics, are being united to provide a moreholistic interpretation of our world. The fate of living systems issimultaneously influenced by the traits of both determinism and uncertainty.PSST . . . THE GAME IS FIXED: PIERRE-SIMON LAPLACEIn the physical Universe influenced by the laws of Newtonian mechanics, materialparts engage with the same dynamics of colliding billiard balls. In such aUniverse, a mathematician or anyone with the acumen of legendary pool masterMinnesota Fats can predict, or determine, the actions of all the balls after acollision.In recognizing that the Universe’s fundamental particles behaved as “nanobilliard balls,” French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace evolved the conceptof scientific determinism.8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en133] Tosummarize Laplace: if, at one time, we knew the positions and speeds of all theparticles—billiard balls—in the Universe, then we could calculate their behaviorat any other time, past or future. With enough data about previous events andthe use of appropriate mathematics, we could conceivably model dynamic systemsand provide accurate predictions for future outcomes. The principle ofscientific determinism implies that every state of affairs, including everyhuman event, act, and decision, is the inevitable linear consequence ofantecedent events.However, there is a fruit fly in the ointment. According to Darwinism, evolutionhas been built on random mutations that occur independently of the environment.This would seem to contradict Laplace’s model of a predictive Universe. Darwin’stheory specifically emphasizes that the environment does not influence theoutcome of a mutation. Chance-based evolution would represent the Universe’swildcard—like a moth that suddenly alights on the pool table and is run over bythe cue ball, altering the course of what would otherwise be a fixed game.Previously mentioned insights regarding Cairnsian adaptive mutations, throughwhich organisms actively evolve to fit or mesh with the environment, challengescientific materialism’s belief in random evolution. Recent research on adaptivemutations revealed that genetically identical bacteria, when inoculated intocultures containing similarly stressful environments, followed parallel coursesof evolution that unfold in the same way every time, governed by the availableenvironmental niches.9 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en134] Thesenoteworthy findings support Laplace’s notion of predicting the future; if itwere possible to get enough data about the starting conditions in that stressfulenvironment, we could, with high accuracy, predict the course of bacterialevolution in each of those cultures.In a limited fashion, medical science has already been directing evolution for ahundred years. Every time physicians inoculate patients with a vaccine, they arecontrolling the evolution of specific genes in the immune system. By compoundingselected viral or bacterial antigens in the vaccine, they can induce humanimmune systems to create precisely structured antibody proteins thatspecifically bind to and mark those antigens for destruction.It’s important to note that the genes that encode the structure of the inducedantibody proteins did not exist in their specialized form prior to thevaccination. Rather, they were shaped through the same adaptive process ofsomatic hypermutation described above. Scientists specifically direct themutation of an antibody gene and, in the process, control the immune system’sevolution. Similarly, industrial microbiologists shape evolution when theyintroduce bacteria into specific environments in order to generate mutant formsthat can digest oil spills and other contaminating toxins.Working from the assumption of a deterministic Universe, MIT professor EdwardLorenz, an early pioneer in chaos theory, designed his own weather toy in 1960using a set of relatively simple Newtonian physics equations. His goal was tomathematically model weather systems in order to make weather prediction morescientifically accurate. When Lorenz programmed the computer to solve hisequations to an accuracy of seven decimal places, the printouts revealed aconsistently predictable model.However, Lorenz’s most significant discovery came when he was pressed for timeand he rounded off his data to four decimal places in order to speed processingtime. On this particular run, the computer printed out a completely differentresult than what he had come to expect. In changing his data by less than athousandth of a unit, Lorenz ended up with a vastly different conclusion. Heobserved that what appears to be an infinitesimal difference at start up couldmake all the difference in the world in regard to the result.By using the rounded values, Lorenz accidentally stumbled on the concept ofsensitivity, one of the most important insights concerning inherent behavioralpatterns in complex dynamic systems. Sensitivity emphasizes that extremely smalldifferences in initial conditions can lead to major consequences that areperceived as random changes. Consequently, much of what we have come toattribute to random events actually turns out to be quite predictable—if thereis enough sensitivity in acquiring initial data.10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en135]Lorenz’s concept has become popularly known as the Butterfly Effect, whichstates, “A butterfly stirring the air today in Beijing can transform stormsystems next month in New York.” While such phenomena may be hard to imagine,Lorenz’s discovery actually tells us that dynamic systems, which include weatherpatterns, ocean currents, and the evolution of the biosphere, while appearing tobehave randomly are actually deterministic and, therefore, predictable.11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en136]GOD THROWS DICE . . . AND THEY’RE NOT LOADED: WERNER HEISENBERGBefore you bet the farm on a vision of a deterministic Universe, it is necessaryto temper that surety with a little insight from the eminent quantum physicistWerner Heisenberg. The classical view, put forward by Laplace, was that thefuture motion of particles was completely determined, if one knew theirpositions and velocities at one time.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en137] This view had to be modified whenHeisenberg’s uncertainty principle revealed that it was not possible toaccurately know both a particle’s position and its speed because, in measuringone parameter, the observer distorts the other.The uncertainty principle contradicts the surety implied in Newtoniandeterminism. Quantum mechanics does not negate Newtonian determinism; it does,however, temper it with the quality of probability. While one may never be ableto accurately predict the future, with enough information the probability of aguess being correct can be extremely high.For millennia, humans have observed that the sun rises in the east and sets inthe west. One could predict that on a Monday one year from now, the sun willagain rise in the east and set in the west. The odds for that are so good thatno one is likely to bet against that feat of prognostication. However, althoughit’s an improbable reality, a comet could hit Earth before then and cause theplanet to spin in the reverse direction. The significance of our story is thatthe future is based on probability, not on surety. Einstein, very uncomfortablewith the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, chose to believe that “Goddoes not play dice with the Universe.”Darwinian theory emphasizes that evolution occurs through a series of infinitelygradual transformations over eons of time wherein one species evolves intoanother. In contrast, paleontologists Gould and Eldredge verified that evolutionactually results from long periods of stability that are periodicallyinterrupted by catastrophic upheavals. In the wake of each catastrophe,extinctions are followed by an explosive increase in the number of new species.The rapid origin and evolution of the new species occurs at a faster pace thancan be accounted for by Darwinian mechanisms. In other words, evolution occursby sudden leaps, not gradual transitions.Sound familiar? Remember the quantum leaps that electrons experience as theyjump from one energy shell of an atom to the next energy shell? This was the keydiscovery by Max Planck that created the science of quantum physics a centuryago. Organismal evolution also reveals itself to be a quantum process in thesense that, at a certain level of complexity, entirely new emergent forms appearthat could not have been predicted by the nature of their parts.To imagine that a sperm and egg could become a human, if you really think aboutit, is a stretch of the imagination. But it is so universally accepted thatthere seems to be nothing unusual about it. Perhaps the next stretch of ourimagination will be the appearance of an emergent human culture, scarcelypredictable by the way people act and interact now, that will allow humans tosurvive and cooperatively thrive at a new level of complexity.Insights into the nature of forces driving emergent processes have been providedby studies on the swarming behavior of insects, the flocking behavior of birds,and the schooling behavior of fish. What is it that enables these animals to actin accord with one another to instantly change patterns of behavior?In an intriguing study of fish behavior, British researcher Iain Couzin and histeam, using a mathematical model, found that schools of fish switch theiralignment and relationship based on their proximity to other fish within theschool.13 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en138] When what is known as thealignment zone is negligible—meaning where fish aren’t close enough to affectone another—they barely pay attention to each other as they swim around inrandom patterns. As soon as the quantity of fish reaches a critical number orthey are forced closer together due to some environmental factor, the patternchanges. At a certain critical proximity, the fish begin following each other ina circular doughnut-like swarm. When their proximity reaches the next criticaljuncture, the pattern once again changes, this time with the fish swimming inparallel and forming schools. So, what causes these nonlinear changes inbehavior patterns?In search of an answer, Couzin and his team switched their study to ant swarmsand began to find clues regarding group dynamics. Prior studies of herd behaviorhad indicated the presence of consensus decisions. For example, when 51 percentof a herd looked in a certain direction, the entire herd would advance in thatdirection.Couzin, however, uncovered a more subtle distinction in what appeared to beleaders or trend setters, which he called “experts,” who seemed to have greateracuity regarding where to find food or where danger lurked. Larger groups reliedon a smaller proportion of experts to influence the group’s behavior. Forexample, 30 ants needed four or five experts, a ratio of 16 to 20 percent, whilea group of 200 could also be led by just five experts representing a mere 2.5percent of the population.14 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en139]Expert ants do not appear to have different physical traits from other ants.However, they seem to be better attuned to the field, and other ants seem toknow that. Therefore, were Couzin a spiritual healer, he might have named themshaman ants, priest ants, or visionary ants simply because they appear to act inconcert with the needs of the whole.Correspondingly, it seems that evolution of the human swarm is also predicatedon both its density and number of experts. As the mass of the human populationreaches a certain density and we are forced to live and work in greaterproximity to each other, the influence of a proportionally few creative culturalexperts will guide us to abruptly change pattern and direction as we evolve to amore awakened, conscious, and life-affirming version of humanity. As Lamarckmight have envisioned, these experts will help us save ourselves from ourselves.SO WHAT DO WE KNOW, AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?So, now that we’ve exposed and dismantled the Four Myth-Perceptions of theApocalypse, what do we know? We know that even though scientific materialismwould have us focus our attention on the material realm, it’s the intangiblefield that governs the particle. When we expand our view to encompass theinvisible field, we realize that both science and religion have been invokingthe same invisible moving forces in regard to the factors that shape life. Weknow that any healthy worldview must acknowledge and encompass both visiblematter and the invisible field, otherwise we leave out half of reality.We also know that the Universe is relational. When we choose to gain at theexpense of another person, we are clearly not operating at optimum efficiency.And, while survival of the fittest has enabled some in our species to do verywell, survival of the individual at the expense of the whole now threatens thesurvival of the whole—which, incidentally, includes the individual.We know that, by focusing on genetics as destiny, we have disempowered ourimpact on the greater portion of reality we can do something about. It has ledto us giving our power over to a new priesthood of white-coated intercessors.The good news is, by acknowledging and learning to use our own inherent power,we can create a more effective, efficient, and survivable world.We know that evolution, which mystified our ancestors for many generations, isnot a random process, but one that follows predictable patterns inherent inchaotic dynamic systems. By recognizing these patterns, we can employ them,along with our own intelligence, to co-create with Nature. We might even saythere is an evolutionary imperative that drives us forward, toward greaterknowledge and experience—with an emphasis on continuation of life.But, before becoming overly confident in our ability to make predictions, wewould be wise to remember that the quantum character of the Universe, the cosmicprankster, emphasizes that predictions are more accurately probabilities andthat quantum jumps may provide for the emergence of new forms or traits thatcould not have been otherwise predicted. Like the bacteria in John Cairns’experiment, which quickly learned to survive in a stressful environment, wehumans must now engage in the adaptive mutation processes by brainstormingpossible changes in beliefs and behaviors until we find viable solutions thatwill sustain our survival in face of the environmental challenges that liebefore us.We are fortunate, indeed, that the Internet, a rapid, almost instantaneous formof grassroots worldwide communication, now exists. This means that societalmutations that work in one place can be rapidly disseminated across the planet.The power inherent in the shared awareness is unparalleled in human history. Inlight of the fact that knowledge is power, humanity is now endowed with enoughpower to nurture and heal our planet and our selves in a predictable way.An important aspect to fully expressing our shared awareness is to first becomewholly aware of where humanity is now. After all, the first step in any recoveryprogram is to acknowledge reality as it is. That’s why trail maps have a “YouAre Here” indicator. And where civilization is now—well, it ain’t a prettyplace. This is in a large part due to the institutionalized insanity thatsociety created by supporting the obsolete and dysfunctional beliefs we havedefined as the Four Myth-Perceptions of the Apocalypse:Only Matter MattersSurvival of the FittestIt’s in Your GenesEvolution Is RandomAlthough each belief seemed logical at one time, new science reveals that noneis true. These failed paradigms unconsciously hold in place the currentdysfunctions that threaten our survival. Once we release ourselves from theselimiting misperceptions, we will be open to a whole new world of possibilitiesand opportunities. Radical thinking will open doors to an emergent future wecannot even fathom."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9DYSFUNCTION AT THE JUNCTION“The truth shall upset you free.”— Swami Beyondananda Even though we have bid farewell to the Four Myth-Perceptions of the Apocalypse,guess what? They’re still here, and they are carrying us “fool speed ahead” downthe wrong track. Even though these myths have been undermined by new science,they leave behind institutions and structures that were designed to support andpropagate scientific materialism’s paradigmatic wisdom. Over time, theseinstitutions acquired a life of their own, and, as with any living organism,they are driven by the biological imperative to survive and re-createthemselves. In this chapter, we identify these institutional agents of ourcultural dysfunction in order to avoid an otherwise inevitable train wreck atthe junction.THE AMERICAN DEVOLUTIONThe story of scientific materialism is reflected in the history of the UnitedStates, a nation originally conceived in the age of philosophical enlightenment,which was characterized by a balance between spiritual and material realms. Aswe have seen, the Founding Fathers of the United States were deeply spiritual,influenced both by perennial wisdom of the Western world and native peoples ofNorth America. The institutional structures they designed for justice andself-governance were eminently practical—at least practical enough to last morethan two centuries.America’s enlightened founding documents were pro-life in the most profoundsense. At a time when almost all humans in what was considered to be thecivilized world were living as subjects under the whim of monarchs and warlords,the colonialists of this upstart start-up nation offered a truly radical conceptthat all human beings have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappiness. In the last two centuries, people suffering under the domination ofmight-makes-right governments have looked to the Declaration of Independence forlight, guidance, and encouragement.And yet, over the span of those 200-plus years, many would say the United Stateshas regressed from a beacon of freedom to just another power-hungry empire thatthe rest of the world perceives as armed and dangerous. Are other countriesjealous of our freedoms, as our government has asserted? Or have those cherishedfreedoms diminished to such an extent that the country’s so-called free press isno longer willing or able to reflect America’s shadow?America, at its beginning, embodied the best the world had to offer: inalienablerights and freedoms—at least for white men. However, as pursuit of happinessmorphed into pursuit of material, all of the promises became compromised. Sowhat went wrong? How did this happen?THE CHANGING OF THE GODAs we have seen, each new basal paradigm brings with it a wave of functionalityand resonant truth. Monotheism brought a sense of order and spiritual focus at atime of idolatry and superstition. Scientific materialism was a breath of freshair in a world that had been stifled by religious hierarchy that promoted rigidbelief. However, during each “changing of the God,” some things were lost asother things were gained. As industrial societies replaced agrarian communities,the threads of communal connection that offered a common moral authorityunraveled.Remember, science, as pure knowledge, has no inherent morality or immorality butis values-neutral. Consequently, when scientific materialism cut us loose fromthe laws of the Bible, it created a moral vacuum. And, because human natureabhors a moral vacuum, something had to fill the void. Unfortunately, in thewake of Darwinian theory, the laws of the human jungle—laws with no moralcode—replaced monotheism’s moral authority.Ever so gradually and ever so relentlessly, a new god, one with awesome temporalpower, assumed dominion and introduced the unholy trinity of materialism, money,and machine. Not only do we worship the material, but we’ve accepted it as oursavior. Despite urgent messages from reality that the opposite is true,conventional wisdom persists in reinforcing the beliefs that money will make ushappy, weaponry will make us safe, drugs will make us healthy, and more and moreinformation will make us wise.The good news is these dysfunctional expressions of reality are not a result ofhard-wired human nature but originate from the inhuman nature of thought,elevated to programmed beliefs.The first step to deprogramming dogmatic dysfunction is to recognize therelationship between paradigms that are assumed to be true and the institutionsand structures created to support those perceived truths. In deference toEinstein’s dictum that “the field is the sole governing agent of the particle,”consider that the field largely consists of invisible beliefs while theparticles are the institutional structures that embody truths and convertthoughts and beliefs into things.The second step is to realize the magnitude of the influence of theseparadigmatic structures. These institutions shape the patterns of behavior thatbecome accepted as fundamental parts of society’s culture. They influence theworld through industries, governments, schools, and organizations that fosterand promote their beliefs. In other words, we’re talking about a major part ofsociety’s mental and physical structure.The third step is to identify and name the manifestations of these institutionalstructures within modern society. It’s important to realize each of themyth-perceptions that we examined and debunked earlier in Part II has givenbirth to its own institutional entity.• The belief that only matter matters has fostered Moneychangers in the Temple.• The belief in survival of the fittest has empowered the Lowest CommonDominator.• The belief that it’s in your genes has created an Unhealthy Care System.• And the belief that evolution is random has led to Weapons of Mass-Distractiondesigned to distract people from exercising their inherent Nature-given powers.As we explore each of these institutions, we see that every one of them startedout, more or less, in a functional balance between spirit and matter but becameless functional as its truths moved further away from the balance point.Therefore, each had value in its time but then also lost value over time, givingway to the next valued thought system or belief.By reviewing the development of each of these institutions, we can betterdiscern the essential evolution that is also occurring in regard to the answersfor those enduring perennial questions:1. How did we get here?2. Why are we here?3. Now that we’re here, how do we make the best of it?MONEYCHANGERS IN THE TEMPLEAccording to the New Testament and the chronicles of the historian Josephus,during the time of Jesus, the Pharisees, who were the ruling class in Jewishsociety, developed an elaborate pay-to-pray system. A half shekel admissionprice was required to partake in the Passover service, and moneychangers werestationed outside the temple to collect this fee and sell the cattle, sheep, anddoves that would make the ultimate sacrifice so humans could get right with God.In the only instance in the Gospels where Jesus showed anger, he reportedly tookout a whip, overturned the moneychangers’ tables, and scattered their coins. Wecan only imagine what Jesus would say today when the moneychangers are no longerstationed outside the temples but have, instead, set up tollbooths in front ofjust about every commodity that once contributed—for free—to life, liberty, andthe pursuit of happiness. How big of a whip would Christ use, for example,within the board-room of a company that declares its intention to wholly andcompletely own all of the world’s food seeds? And how severely would Christchastise Americans, 83 percent of whom professes to be Christian, for not evenblinking an eye over such an outrage against the common rights of all humanity?MONSANTO CLAUSE IS COMING TO TOWNIn Yiddish lore, the classic definition of chutzpah is killing your parents thenbegging the court for mercy for being an orphan. But perhaps chutzpah has a newposter child.Monsanto, a company once known for producing the deadly herbicide Agent Orangeand, today, one of the largest transnational chemical agribusinesses in theworld, produces a genetically modified seed, Round-Up Ready Canola.1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en140] When pollen from these geneticallymodified plants accidentally blows over to neighboring farms that use organic orother conventional canola seeds, it will fertilize those plants and introducethe engineered genes, making them essentially Round-Up Ready clones. When thishappens, Monsanto sues the neighboring farmer for using their engineered geneswithout paying for them.2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en141]Monsanto, which owns over 674 biotechnology patents—essentially proprietary lifeforms—has a unique business model. When farmers buy their genetically modifiedseeds, they must sign an agreement that stipulates they will not save the seedsor replant them. In other words, farmers must agree to buy seeds from Monsantoevery year. To reinforce this agreement, Monsanto has unleashed an army of spiesand investigators to make sure their seed doesn’t get surreptitiously planted,accidentally or otherwise. According to investigative reporters Donald L.Bartlett and James B. Steele, Monsanto has launched thousands of investigationsand hundreds of lawsuits. Most farmers, intimidated by the corporation’s legalfire power, pay up without defending themselves, innocent or not.3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en142]Farm-saved seed has been a staple of agriculture everywhere, representing todaysome 80 to 90 percent of seed used. However, Monsanto has other plans. Accordingto Jeffrey M. Smith, author of Seeds of Deception, Monsanto envisions a worldwhere 100 percent of all seeds are “genetically modified and patented.”4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en143] Part of their plan includesintimidating farmers. Another strategy is to buy up conventional seed companies.Over a two-week period in 2005, Monsanto purchased Seminis, a company thatcontrolled 40 percent of the U.S. market for lettuce, tomato, and othervegetable seeds, and Emergent Genetics, America’s third largest cottonseedcompany.5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en144]While consumers and farmers worldwide are seeking to head Monsanto off at thepass, the company seems to have influential friends in high places. SupremeCourt Justice Clarence Thomas was an attorney for Monsanto in the 1970s. In2001, he wrote a key ruling on genetically modified seeds that benefitedMonsanto and other companies that make genetically modified seeds.6[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en145]We could fill chapters, if not entire books, with horror stories of howprivatizing privateers have brought their mining operations—“That’s mine! That’smine! That’s mine!”—to every corner of the globe. While the power of money isundeniable, that power is kept in place by our own largely unconscious agreementthat it deserves to rule. For the last word on Monsanto and their ilk, we turnto Native American activist Winona LaDuke, who once explained geneticengineering to a group of Ojibwa elders. Their response was, “Who gave them theright to do that?”7 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en146]Who, indeed? Read on.THE GREAT BANKING ROBBERYTo understand how completely our society has allowed not only the power of moneybut also the power of the speculative economy to rule, let’s take a look at howmoney got swept into power along with scientific materialism.Money has been with us ever since the advent of trade. Gold and other preciousmetals were pressed into coinage to represent goods that had real value in theworld. Instead of having to say, “I’ll give you a twentieth of this goat forthat chicken,” money became a convenient tool for commerce.As merchants accumulated more coins than they could conveniently tote, theybegan to store the coins with goldsmiths, who issued paper money as IOUs orpromissory notes. U.S. currency, for example, contains the acknowledgement:“This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.”At some point, the goldsmiths made a happy discovery. At any given time, only asmall fraction of merchants would come to collect their deposits. Thus beganfractional reserve banking, which is the practice of loaning paper money invalues up to ten times the actual amount of gold on hand. This practice is afundamental characteristic of banking systems today.Loaning money for profit was forbidden under the rule of the Church. However, inthe 1500s, after the Protestant Reformation and after King Henry VIII relaxedthe lending laws in England, the power of money accompanied civilization on itspath into the material realm.During the next century, the lending policy of loose money, followed by tightmoney, created an economic crisis in England. When loans were plentiful, peopleborrowed freely and loosely. But at some point, bankers said, “That’s enough,”tightened their lending practices, and called in their loans. People who hadborrowed during good times of economic expansion found themselves unable torepay during times of contraction. Bankers then relieved those unfortunateindebted souls of their collateral, that is, their homes or other property, atpennies on the dollar and resold the repossessed collateral at a great profit.War, which is another boon to bankers, led to the British Crown becoming theworld’s biggest debtor by the 1600s. But the bankers had a royal solution:create the Bank of England, which, in spite of its name, is not part of theBritish government but a privately held company owned by the bankers themselves.The Bank of England had a perfect Ponzi scheme, a form of fraud in which beliefin the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by quick returns for thefirst investors from money invested by later investors. The bankers asked theBritish government to put up the initial one million pounds. They then loanedout ten times that much—ten million pounds—to their cronies who used this money,made out of thin air, to buy shares in this new bank. The bank agreed to loanthe money back to England, securing interest debt with taxes paid by thepeople!8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en147]Meanwhile, off in the New World, the economy was thriving. Because preciousmetals were scarce, the colonialists had been forced to print their owncurrency, which they called “colonial scrip.” This scrip was essentially fiatmoney, currency backed by nothing more than a commonly accepted agreement thatthe money had value. Because this currency was not debt-based but accuratelyrepresented the value of goods and services without interest, everyonebenefited. However, a poorly timed boast by Benjamin Franklin squelched thatcurrency and helped hasten the American Revolution.While visiting England, Franklin was asked how he accounted for the prosperityof the colonies. He credited the issuance of colonial scrip, then added, “Wecontrol the purchasing power of money and have no interest to pay.” That’s allKing George III and the Bank of England had to hear.9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en148]By 1764, Parliament had passed the Currency Act, which prohibited the coloniesfrom issuing their paper currency in any form. Without the currency to conductdaily business, the Colonial economy went into a severe depression. In 1766,Franklin went to London seeking the law’s repeal, but to no avail. America’sloss of sovereignty over issuing its own currency was a prime cause of theRevolutionary War and a reason why the Founding Fathers were adamant about nothaving a National Bank.10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en149]In spite of those good intentions, a battle raged during the first 120 years ofAmerica’s history over who would be in charge of issuing currency: the banks orthe government. As the path of humanity led deeper into materialism, the powerof the banks won out.Consider that America went on the gold standard in 1873, only 13 years afterevolutionist Thomas Huxley won his debate with creationist Bishop SamuelWilberforce and, thus, elevated scientific materialism to the role ofcivilization’s “official” truth provider. In both science and economics, theparadigm shift was official: the Golden Rule had been overruled by the Rule ofGold.Meanwhile, civilization’s trek into the material realm had a major effect inother arenas as well. In 1886, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that,supposedly, gave corporations the same rights as persons. In actuality, acorporation is an anomaly: it is a nonliving entity with a birth certificate—itsarticles of incorporation—that allows it to exist forever. It functions insociety, yet it is not subject to the moral constraints of humans.What’s even more anomalous is that, in reality, the Supreme Court never decidedany such thing. The spurious ruling was actually the creative, if not malicious,deviation of J. C. Bancroft Davis. Davis was a lawyer, a diplomat, and formerrailroad president who was serving in the capacity of a court reporter duringthe case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company in 1886.11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en150]One function of a court reporter is to write headnotes for Supreme Court cases.Headnotes are summaries of the key legal points used by the court in rendering acase’s decision. Headnote summaries represent a court reporter’s interpretationof the case but are not official opinions rendered by the court. Lawyers useheadnotes as a quick study guide in reviewing case content and court judgmentsPrior to the Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company case, theBill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution stated thatcorporations as well as unions, churches, unincorporated business, partnerships,and governments had privileges while persons had rights. Davis introduced afalsified statement in his headnotes by writing: “The defendant Corporations arepersons within the intent of the clause in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendmentto the Constitution of the United States, which forbids a state to deny anyperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” In otherwords, Davis’s engineered summary elevated corporations from the privilegescategory and gave them the same rights as humans.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en151]Relevant to the story is that the issue of corporate rights was not even part ofthe trial. Chief Justice Morrison Waite reported that the Supreme Court “avoidedmeeting the Constitution question in the decision.” However, no one took noticethat Davis’s fabrication about corporate personhood twisted the intent of theFourteenth Amendment. Davis’s fictionalized headnotes were subsequently cited inother court cases, and, in the process, they acquired the status of legalprecedent.13 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en152]This headnote provided a giant step toward giving life to a money machine. Infact, President Grover Cleveland warned in 1888, “As we view the achievements ofaggregated capital, . . . the citizen . . . is trampled to death beneath an ironheel. Corporations . . . are fast becoming the people’s masters.”14[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en153]A quarter century later, the bankers decisively won their battle to controlAmerica’s currency. In 1913, during a Christmas recess when most members ofCongress were on vacation, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal ReserveAct, the decree that set up a private company to issue public currency as debt.Just as the Bank of England is not really the bank of the English government,the Federal Reserve Bank is no more federal than Federal Express.Perhaps Wilson was motivated by the status of the U.S. economy, which hedescribed in his book The New Freedom, published in that same year. “We havecome to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled anddominated governments in the civilized world—no longer a government by freeopinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, buta government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.”15[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en154] Although Wilson apparently believedhe was stabilizing America’s economy by signing the Federal Reserve Act, puttingthe bankers in charge of the nation’s financial well being could not prevent theGreat Depression 16 years later.Currency has been issued as debt for nearly a century, and we have the red inkto prove it. America’s national debt, as of early 2008 is $9.5 trillion—morethan $31,000 for every man, woman, and child in America—and is increasing by amind-boggling $1.85 billion per day. Meanwhile, America’s total debt—forhouseholds, financial entities, businesses, and the government—is now over $53trillion.16 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en155]PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS? LOOKS LIKE IT GOT AWAYThe Happy Planet Index is a study that measures not only happiness but the costof obtaining that happiness in terms of ecological impact and overall quality oflife. The calculation is simple.Life Satisfaction x Life Expectancy÷ Ecological Footprint = Happiness IndexPut another way, the Happy Planet Index measures how efficiently a countryconverts the finite resources of our planet into the happiness and well-being ofits citizens. The United States comes in at 150th out of 178 nations, trailingsuch countries as Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Pakistan to name just a few.17[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en156]Why does the United States have such a low rank? Well, call us big-foot. Ourecological footprint is among the biggest in the world. In order to achieve thelife satisfaction and life expectancy of a person in Costa Rica, which came inat number three in the index, the average American uses four-and-a-half timesmore resources! Now, that’s inefficiency!And yet, our financial system continues to spin its yarn, selling theunrealistic hope that doing more of the same—shop ‘til you drop—will yielddifferent results.This fast track to economic suicide is reinforced by faith in another disprovedmyth, the survival of the fittest. In our collective affirmation that onlymaterial can save us, we have put our faith in the most insane, expensive, andharmful military machine in the history of humanity, and, in doing so, we haveempowered a sinister force—the lowest common dominator.LOWEST COMMON DOMINATORWith the “changing of the gods,” the law of the jungle replaced the law of theBible as our moral guidepost. This didn’t happen right away, nor is it accurateto say that people had ever actually lived by the laws of the Bible. Very earlyon, “thou shalt not kill” was modified to “thou shalt not kill unless done inextremely large groups.”Consequently, during the course of the 20th century, some 260 million humanbeings died as a result of warfare.18 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en157]That doesn’t include the suffering of those who didn’t die but were maimed, lefthomeless, or otherwise traumatized. Consider, too, the fears and traumasassociated with these conflicts, both conscious and unconscious, which have beenpassed on to those alive on the planet now.The staggering human cost of war in the 20th century, the first time weexperienced two hot world wars and a very expensive cold one, is partly a resultof officially institutionalizing the long-standing belief that might makesright, or what we refer to as the lowest common dominator.The power of force has been in force so long that we assume it is natural.Looking at the whole of Western history, with a few exceptions we will explorelater, we see that violence and domination have been internalized, externalized,and eternalized: violence has been declared a character of human nature for nowand forever.HUMAN NATURE OR INHUMAN NATURE?A major flaw in the mythos of an evil human nature becomes apparent whenanthropologists assess prehistoric cultures and find quite the opposite is true.In her important contribution The Chalice and the Blade macro-historian RianeEisler cites remarkable discoveries by archaeologist Marija Gimbutas ofprehistoric societies in which no weapons were unearthed among thousands ofdiscovered artifacts.19 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en158]Furthermore, as British archaeologist James Mellaart discovered in hisexcavations of the Neolithic site at Catal Huyuk, in what is now Turkey, earlyagrarian societies appear to have been egalitarian. Mellaart found that thesizes of their houses, the contents inside, and the funerary gifts buried ingraves indicate few, if any, differences in class hierarchy and social status.20[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en159]As Eisler emphatically points out, these societies were not matriarchies, butegalitarian cultures. The title of her book, The Chalice and the Blade, comesfrom the distinction between the chalice, which is the vessel that representslife-generating and nurturing feminine powers, and the blade, which representsmasculine rule.Modern conventional wisdom would have us believe that, in a one-on-one,chalice-versus-sword contest, the smart money would be on the sword because,apparently at some point, sword-bearing warriors would overrun self-sustainingchalice-sharing cultures. However, as we are discovering, survival and thrivalof our planet may yet depend on reawakening, revitalizing, and reinstating thenurturing chalice paradigm.Unfortunately, in the wake of civilization’s trek into materialism, that chalicehas become dry. The rise of the sword and the loss of the chalice have beenencouraged by society’s two most recent basal paradigms, monotheism andscientific materialism, each of which has clearly valued the yang over the yin,the active over the passive, and the masculine over the feminine. The cost ofthis imbalance is so steep that it now threatens the very existence of ourspecies.Let’s return for a moment to America’s Founding Fathers. When Ben Franklin andhis peers adopted the political structure of the Iroquois Nations, they left outone key element of Native American culture that would never have been acceptedby their own tribe. As far as we know, no one ever proposed that Betsy, Martha,and Dolly serve on a Council of Grandmothers. As enlightened as our founderswere and even though they embodied the feminine in the Declaration ofIndependence by declaring their respect and understanding for “the laws ofNature and Nature’s God,” the idea of actually handing women the moral authorityto approve war or impeach chiefs was inconceivable—clearly the consequence of aEuropean bias, not to mention nearly 5,000 years of discounting anddisempowering the feminine.FROM LAMB-O TO RAMBOYet, consider the consequences of a culture devoid of feminine power. Rememberthe bonobo chimps we talked about in Chapter 7, It’s in Your Genes? Unlike otherchimp societies in which males bond and bully smaller males and females, bonobofemales bond with each other and, in the process, eliminate communal bullyingaltogether. It’s not that the females dominate the males, but rather that theyuse their collective solidarity to counterbalance male power.In The Real Wealth of Nations, Riane Eisler offers an enlightening quote fromElizabeth Cady Stanton, an American social activist and leading figure in theearly women’s rights movement: “The world has never yet seen a truly virtuousnation, because in the degradation of women, the very fountains of life arepoisoned at the source.”21 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en160] Thatpoison can be seen and felt in present-day American society where meanness isnot only tolerated, but also cultivated so that the meek really don’t stand achance. Poor Jesus. If he returned now, he wouldn’t recognize himself. Over thelast two centuries, the religious right has managed to transmogrify his imagefrom Lamb-o to Rambo. From Biblical accounts, we know that Jesus actuallyembodied a balance of masculine and feminine traits. Jesus was forceful enoughto overturn the moneychangers’ tables, steadfast enough to endure crucifixion,and yet he preached love and blessed the peacemakers. In contrast, thoseChristians who adopt the “God, Guns, and Guts” posture spend more energy onspiritually bullying the meek than in safeguarding their inheritance.THE POWER OF MONEY MEETS THE POWER OF POWERWith the moral burden of love thy neighbor out of the way, the momentum of thematerialist worldview created the unholiest of unholy alliances—the alliancebetween the power of money and the power of power.During the years following the American Civil War and well into the 20thcentury, it was not uncommon for companies to hire their own armies to keepworkers in line and prevent strikes. The Pinkerton guards began as a privatearmy hired by the railroad corporations to protect their interests, the raillines that crossed the nation.22 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en161] Theywere later utilized as strike breakers by other companies.23[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en162] Even famous automaker Henry Ford hadhis own militia, called Bennett’s Boys in reference to Ford executive HarryBennett a former boxer and reputed thug, to make sure the meek, such as thelaborers who attempted to unionize, didn’t get too emboldened.24[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en163]Although the Founding Fathers frowned on the idea of a standing army, a centuryafter George Washington warned of “entangling alliances”—his code phrase forempire—America’s armed forces were already in the employ of corporations lookingto manifest their destiny overseas.General Smedley Butler, an American hero and the most decorated Marine in U.S.history at the time of his death, spoke with regret of his role in war. In aspeech delivered to the American Legion in 1931 and later published in a booklettitled War Is a Racket, Butler said, “A racket is something . . . conducted forthe benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many.” Butler declared,“War is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious[racket]. It is the only one which is international in scope . . . where theprofits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.”25[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en164]THE WAR TO END ALL WARS . . . DOES NOTHING OF THE KINDNot long after General Butler gave his speech, the world engaged in the second“war to end all wars.” While historians instruct us to view this conflict as abattle against the evils of Nazism, the inconvenient truth indicates that it wasas much about protecting America’s empire in the Pacific Ocean as anything else.The same American empire also contributed to the Nazis’ rise to power in thefirst place. The German war machine was fueled by American industry andfinanced, in part, by American bankers including Averell Harriman and PrescottBush, the father of U.S. President George H. W. Bush and grandfather of U.S.President George W. Bush.26 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en165]At the end of World War II, the United States emerged as the world’s predominantsuper power. Unlike European states and nations of the Far East, the Americanmainland had suffered no bombing, no invasion, and no damage to itsinfrastructure. But perceived peace and tranquility was short lived because onJuly 14, 1949, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb. America’s responseto that event launched the Cold War and set the U.S. on a karmic course that hasled us to where America is today—armed to the teeth, ten trillion dollars indebt, and feeling less safe than ever.That atomic test, plus the fact that the U.S. had actually used two atomic bombsto kill 220,000 Japanese civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World WarII, created a tension unlike any that the world had ever borne. It was one thingfor soldiers to battle soldiers with clubs, spears, or bayonets, and quiteanother for a mindless leader or reckless general to press a button and unleasha global nuclear holocaust. Or, as Albert Einstein succinctly stated, “I knownot with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will befought with sticks and stones.”So, let’s look at the decision factors facing post-World War II President HarryS. Truman. Shortly after the war, aircraft manufacturers wrote letters tocolleagues in the State Department, expressing their concern about their owneconomic fate in a postwar economy. State Department officials then convincedTruman that pumping money into military industry would avert another GreatDepression.27 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en166] Not that the convincinginvolved much debate. According to Noam Chomsky, “It wasn’t really a debatebecause it was settled before it started, but the issue was at leastraised—should the government pursue military spending or social spending?”28[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en167]Meanwhile, when it came to drafting policy, Truman was receiving conflictingadvice from two of Secretary of State Dean Acheson’s key advisers. One, GeorgeKennan, had developed a reputation as an anti-communist diplomat assigned to theSoviet Union, but he did not see that nation as a military threat to the UnitedStates. Kennan concluded that the Soviet Union, under the rule of Joseph Stalin,was struggling to rebuild after the war and had no expansionist aims, and thesefacts were confirmed by CIA National Intelligence Estimates.29[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en168]The other adviser, Paul Nitze, had been a Wall Street investment banker andbelieved the key to America’s economic and political security lay in creating amilitary-industrial state. On October 11, 1949, less than three months after theSoviets exploded their bomb, Kennan presented his view that the United Statesshould forge an agreement with the Soviet Union that neither state would everuse the weapons. On that very same day, Nitze presented his own viewpoint. Hesaid it would be “necessary to lower rather than raise civilian standards ofliving in order to produce arms.”30 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en169]In early 1950, Truman directed Paul Nitze to fashion an elaborate blueprint fora Cold War economy. The document was titled “NSC-68: United States Objectivesand Programs for National Security.” And the rest is history—a sad historysustaining a precedent set by a document Nitze later called “appropriate for themind of 1950.”31 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en170]According to the aptly named illustrated exposé “Addicted to War,” written bycollege professor Joel Andreas, since 1948, the U.S. has spent $15 trillion onthe military-industrial complex, an amount of money greater than the value ofall the factories, machinery, roads, bridges, water and sewage systems,airports, railroads, power plants, office buildings, shopping centers, schools,hospitals, hotels, and houses in the country added together.32[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en171]And for those of you who want to zero in on what $15 trillion looks like to anaccountant, well, it’s a number with a lot of 0s and commas—$15,000,000,000,000.That will buy a lot of bullets!No wonder things seem a tad out of balance.GOBBLE-IZATIONUndoubtedly, there are forces who seek to destroy American power, but those whoprofit from power have conveniently obscured and hidden the rationale for theirdestructive actions from view. Combine the power of the moneychangers and thepower of corporations, back it up with the power of the most formidable militaryin the history of the world, and you have the relentlessly powerful,conscience-free machine gobbling up the world’s resources in an unprecedented“mine-ing” operation.While proponents of an international economy innocuously tout free trade as abenefit of globalization, they would be speaking more accurately if they calledit “gobble-ization.” That’s because the same tactics that worked for the Bank ofEngland and the Federal Reserve Bank—make money easy to borrow but hard to payback—have paid great dividends to bankers worldwide.And the two biggest worldwide bankers today are the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), both of which came into existence in 1944 and1945 in an attempt by 45 Allied nations to regulate international monetary andfinancial order at the conclusion of World War II.Ostensibly, the World Bank provides financial and technical assistance to whatare considered to be developing countries and nations recovering from conflict,natural disasters, and humanitarian emergencies. The IMF monitors globalfinancial systems, exchange rates, and balances of payments.While almost all nations on the planet participate with these powerful entities,critics maintain that their primary purpose is to support United States businessinterests around the globe and that their policies and actions actuallycontribute to global poverty by keeping developing nations in a state ofpermanent debt.In his book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, activist John Perkins describeshis own role as an international banker in extending—or ratheroverextending—credit to Third World countries in a scam in which banks and theirfavored crony companies made billions at the expense of the poor. How? Bypurposely lending them more than the developing countries could possibly repay,then taking over key economic resources when they inevitably defaulted. Soundfamiliar? Yep, that’s the same loose-money, tight-money ploy used by goldsmithsof the Middle Ages. When it comes to greed, bad pennies keep coming back.But the alliance between money and power has an even darker side. Perkinsexplained, “Economic hit men are sent in first with plenty of money to greasethe wheels.” If the officials in question turn down the so-called opportunity,the situation is then “explained to them” by the other hit men, that is,CIA-sanctioned assassins whom Perkins called “the jackals.”33[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en172]What might George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin thinkabout U.S. participation in this turn of events? Would they wonder how apopulace of free men and women could possibly turn their precious rights oflife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness over to the jackals?Well, it happened at a very vulnerable moment in U.S. history. Emerging from thehorror of World War II, goaded by the fear of communism, and kept in evengreater fear by bomb shelter drills and threats of nuclear war, the Americanpeople were leveraged into agreeing to a mutual-denial pact. In a precursor tothe U.S. military’s policy of “don’t ask, don’t tell” in regard to sexualorientation of its soldiers, the public promised not to ask what was being doneto keep them safe, and the government promised not to tell them.In no way do we mean to suggest that totalitarian Marxist regimes were not agenuine threat. The most conservative estimates are that 20 million Russiansdied for political reasons during the Stalin regime and twice that many Chineseduring the reign of Chairman Mao Tse-tung in China. But hiding behind thoseMarxist threats and taking unfair advantage of their manufactured fears werethose same profiteers who have benefited from all wars.So what is the good news? The good news is that no person or society has everrestored disease and disorder to ease and order without first acknowledging anddiagnosing the malady’s existence. As spiritual writer Eckhart Tolle wrote in ANew Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose, “The greatest achievement ofhumanity is not its works of art, science, or technology, but the recognition ofits own dysfunction, its own madness.”34[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en173]Congratulations! You have now taken the first small, but necessary, step towardhealing—recognizing that something is wrong. Next, we will visit one very sicksituation in which healing has already begun to occur.THE UNHEALTHY CARE SYSTEMNowhere has the power of scientific materialism had more influence than in themedical system. Consequently, it should come as no surprise that health care,itself, is now gravely ill.No doubt you or someone close to you has benefited from modern medicine. Youprobably know a number of individuals who wouldn’t be on the planet today,living well and enjoying their lives, were it not for the intervention ofsurgery, drugs, or medical technology. As our cells have taught us, technologyis a good thing. And yet, as we’ve seen with every one of the myth-perceptions,the same beliefs that are beneficial when they bring the system into balance canlater become detrimental and throw the same system out of balance. The samescientific materialism that has given modern medicine its miraculous powers hasalso empowered its greatest flaw. Pharmaceutical corporations, whose primaryinterest is material gain, have diverted the path of medicine from healing toprofiteering.The past three decades have seen the rise of what medical journalist Jacky Lawcalled “blockbuster medicine”, that is, high-impact, high-priced drugs andtreatments that have literally doubled the cost of health care in America over a25-year period. In 2004, the United States spent $1.9 trillion on healthcare,which was 16 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).35[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en174] And what are we buying with thathigh-priced price tag? Please don’t laugh, because it’s not funny, but thenumber one—or maybe number three—killer in America is not cancer, not heartdisease, but the practice of medicine itself.Huh?Using conservative estimates, a rare self-reflective article in the Journal ofthe American Medical Association acknowledged that, in 2000, the third leadingcause of death in the United States was iatrogenic illness, which, ironically,is an “illness derived from medical treatment.”36[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en175]However, the Nutrition Institute of America commissioned an independent reviewof medical practices and found that “the estimated total number of iatrogenicdeaths—that is, deaths induced inadvertently by a physician or surgeon or bymedical treatment or diagnostic procedures—in the U.S. annually is 783,936.”These statistics are presented in a report appropriately titled Death byMedicine, co-authored by three medical doctors and two doctors of philosophy.37[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en176] In comparison to these nearly 784,000deaths per year attributed to iatrogenic consequences, the second leading causeof death, heart disease, was responsible for just under 700,000 deaths, whilethe third leading cause of mortality was cancer, accounting for 550,000 deaths.These figures emphasize that medicine, itself, might rightfully be designated aspublic health enemy number one.But whether medicine is the number one killer or the number three killer isreally irrelevant. Health care isn’t supposed to be on the list of killers atall. And what might be even more alarming is that the health care system, in anon-caring manner, refers to these patient deaths as the cost of doing medicine.So how did our health-care system get so sick, and what is causing thisseemingly unstoppable financial hemorrhage? The first place to look for theanswer is in the persistent myth-perception that only matter matters and in whatcan best be called Newtonian Medicine.NEWTONIAN MEDICINENewtonian medicine began not with Newton but with Rene Descartes. With Decartes’clear distinction between body and mind, he essentially sawed a human intwo—with one of the halves being invisible. At the time of Descartes in theearly 17th century, the intangible mind, soul, and spirit were, per agreement,the domain of the Church, which left medicine in charge of the material realm ofthe physical, the mechanical, and the measurable. For the past four centuries,medicine has sustained an overriding Newtonian belief that matter controls itsown destiny.Given this worldview, it’s no wonder that science would look for the causes ofdisease in matter itself. At roughly the same time Darwin was postulating histheory of evolution, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur made the connectionbetween disease and microbes. Not only did germ theory fit well with the modelof discrete physical causes for disorders, it also fit with the notion ofdominate or be dominated. We are repeatedly informed that an army of deadlyorganisms, that is, germs and parasites, is standing poised to invade the templeof the body. It’s either them or us!As is the case with any basal paradigm in its ascendancy, scientific materialismbrought great breakthroughs and benefits to a germ-troubled world. This wasespecially true of the rise of modern matter-based medicine that oversaw theeradication of many forms of infectious diseases and the development of miracledrugs, particularly penicillin and insulin. Over the last century, in the wakeof such medical advances, the average life expectancy of Americans has increasedby 30 years.While these advances have been largely attributed to the miracles of medicine,this may not in fact be the case. Public health and social medicine researcherThomas McKeown, concluded that improved nutrition, sanitation, and other lifeconditions were the factors primarily responsible for the decline in mortalityduring the 19th and early 20th centuries.38[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en177]Not surprisingly, matter-based Newtonian medicine reached its greatestprominence in the late 1940s and early 1950s, right around the time that Watsonand Crick claimed that the key to life was encoded in the DNA—the genes, asdiscussed in Chapter 7, It’s in Your Genes. Traditional health practices, suchas natural childbirth and breast-feeding, came to be considered hopelesslybackward as the growing American middle class became “indoctor-nated” with thebelief that the “doctor knows best.”In the Newtonian perspective of medicine, the causes and cures of disease cameto be seen as the consequence of material things that only a medical specialistwith an impressive number of letters after his or her name could understand.Even after allopathic medicine began to show diminishing returns, both in costand effectiveness, its influence remains powerful. Why? As we will see shortly,the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable endeavors in theworld.THE HIGH COST OF PROFITABILITYEvery day, millions of competent, well-intentioned people go to work as doctors,nurses, medical technicians, clerks, orderlies, and hospital staff. Thousandsmore work in laboratories as researchers, seeking cures or, at least, bettertreatments for maladies that range from minor aches and pains to lethaldiseases. Very few of these people are derelict in their duty or intend to doharm, and, yet, as we have seen, the most expensive medical system in the worldisn’t anywhere close to being the most effective or efficient.Despite the highest per capita expenditure for medical care in the world,America ranks close to the bottom for industrialized nations in actual qualityof health care. The numbers are staggering—up from $114 per person in 1960 to$2,738 in 1980 to $5,267 in 2002.39 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en178]And, yes, all those figures are adjusted for cost of living. If you like yourtrends in percentages, the part of the nation’s gross domestic product devotedto medical care has nearly tripled from 5 percent in 1960 to 14.6 percent in2002.40 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en179] As of 2008, 47 millionAmericans are uninsured, which means the playing field of health care istilted—and not in their favor.41 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en180]How did this happen? The primary factor contributing to our unhealthy caresystem, the fatal flaw that negates so many good intentions, is that health carehas become a for-profit business—and a very profitable for-profit business atthat. In a system in which it is tacitly accepted that money matters most andprofit rules, profit ends up making the rules.As an example, a few years ago, when discrepancies between the prices of drugssold in the U.S. and the price of the same drugs sold in other countries wererevealed, Americans became understandably upset. When they found out the reasonsfor the discrepancies, they became even more upset. Drug companies sell drugsmore cheaply elsewhere because they charge what the market will bear, and overthere the market will bear less than it will bear over here. No problem. Theyjust tame the bear market with a little bull about how privileged we are to paymore.Consider the perceived victory for Medicare patients whose medications are nowpaid for by the federal government. The Medicare Modernization Act enacted in2003 entitles persons 65 years of age and over to receive prescriptionmedications free. Well, that’s good, isn’t it? Yep, until the taxpayer gets thebill, that is, and learns that he and she and all of us have to pay the piper tothe tune of $400 billion over ten years.Now, in case you thought the tab would only be a mere $400 billion, take acloser look at the fine print. One month after Congress passed the legislationand before President George W. Bush signed the bill into law, the Bushadministration boosted the ten-year cost by an additional $134 billion over theamount approved by Congress.42 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en181] Whilethe lower amount was reportedly acceptable to fiscally conservative Republicans,the higher $534 billion price tag, had it been properly disclosed, would havelikely led to the bill’s demise. That’s because the bill passed with only afive-vote margin, 220 yeas to 215 nays, as dawn was breaking over the Capitoldome and only after all-night wangling by Republican House Majority Leader TomDeLay and Speaker Dennis Hastert.43 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en182]But, hold on to your spectacles. The fine print gets even finer. Just a year orso after the law’s enactment, the White House budget for the MedicareModernization Act had doubled the cost of those supposedly free drugs to what isestimated to be a whopping $1.2 trillion.44[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en183] Now, if that sounds like the economichit man selling one of those dam—or is it damn?—projects to a Third World nation. . . well, it probably is. While American taxpayers are swallowing anotherbitter financial pill, Uncle Sam is cutting a big check to Big Pharma.Not coincidentally, the drug industry is the most profitable industry in theworld. In her book, The Truth About Drug Companies, Marcia Angell, M.D., thefirst woman to serve as editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine,reports that, in 2001, the top drug companies listed in Fortune 500 had anaverage profit after taxes of 18.5 percent whereas the other Fortune 500companies averaged only 3.3 percent. Commercial banking, with profits of 13.5percent, was the only industry that came close to Big Pharma.45[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en184]Even more amazing is that, in 2002, the $35.9 billion in profits earned by thetop ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 were greater than the profits of theother 490 Fortune 500 companies combined!46[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en185]The challenge for Big Pharma and its shareholders is that it’s costly todevelop, test, and market new drugs. Therefore, it’s far more profitable to findnew uses for old drugs, increase the marketability of existing ones, or makeminor chemical modifications and sell the refurbished drugs as today’s newmodel. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies have employed tremendouscreativity in finding new ways to expand and extend the uses of their currentdrugs with minimal expansion and extension of their budget.Consider the example of statins, a family of medications that are used toregulate the level of cholesterol in the blood. Over the last decade or two,increasing pressure has been put on the public to have their cholesterol levelsmeasured and to do something about them if they are elevated above the FDA’sguidelines. High cholesterol levels are a potent risk factor for cardiovasculardisease, which can ultimately lead to unwanted and potentially fatal events,such as heart attack and stroke.When first introduced, statins, which include brand medications such as Lipitor,Crestor, and Zocor, were prescribed primarily to people with heart disease. Overtime, advertising to the public and heavy marketing to medical professionalshave led us to believe that statins are appropriate for all people. As a result,statins have become a $20 billion a year worldwide market. While a huge stash ofcash has been made on these drugs, is the touted life-saving reputation ofstatins really deserved?An editorial in the premier medical journal The Lancet presented results ofeight heart disease prevention trials that revealed statin therapy was noteffective in reducing overall risk of death. The study found that risk ofcardiovascular events was only minimally reduced by statin therapy. The datarevealed that 67 individuals would need to be treated for five years for justone medical event to be prevented. One of the most startling findings of thisreview was that there was no apparent statin benefit seen in women of any age.47[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en186]In addition to their ineffectiveness, statins are quite dangerous. For example,the warning that comes with a prescription for the statin drug Zocor is 19 pageslong, and, of course, it is all in fine print! The information is so lengthythat most users, as well as the doctors writing prescriptions, never read it.Why is the fact that statin drugs are shown to be largely ineffective andpotentially dangerous for the majority of people who take them ignored bymedical authorities? Could it be politics and money? In 2004, the NationalCholesterol Education Program (NCEP), an expert panel assembled by the NationalInstitute of Health, recommended that previously acceptable levels ofcholesterol be lowered.A scientific assessment of the NCEP’s recommendations, subsequently published inthe “Annals of Internal Medicine” in 2006, revealed: “we found no high-qualityclinical evidence to support current treatment goals for [LDL] cholesterol.” Thereport further acknowledged that the recommended practice of adjusting statindosages to achieve recommended cholesterol levels was not scientifically provento be beneficial or safe.48 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en187]Astonishingly, research has demonstrated that a balanced diet is as effective asstatins to reduce bad cholesterol. Cardiovascular physician Dr. Dean Ornish hasshown that changing lifestyle through diet, exercise, stress reduction, andsocial support can lower what is known as bad cholesterol (LDL) by nearly 40percent.49 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en188] Living a healthy lifestylecan even cause plaques in arteries to shrink, a feat that not even statins havebeen proven to do.So, again, why were the new statin guidelines adopted? After its recommendationswere made and accepted, it was revealed that eight out of nine members of theNCEP’s panel had financial links to companies that manufacture statin drugs.Consider the reality that each time the cholesterol level guideline is dropped,the number of new statin prescriptions provides additional billions of dollarsin profit for the insatiable pharmaceutical companies. The NCEP report’spublisher described the omission of these clear conflicts of interest as “anoversight.”Yeah, right!Ignoring the elephant in the room, the American Academy of Pediatriciansrecently established new cholesterol guidelines for children.50[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en189] Children, eight years of age andolder who have high concentrations of LDL cholesterol in their blood arecandidates for a lifelong regimen of statins in an effort to prevent theoccurrence of cardiovascular disease in their adult life. With no real scienceto support the claim that statins prevent future expression of heart disease,addicting children to a questionable drug is morally reprehensible. Oh, wealmost forgot the pharmaceutical industry operates, like many corporations, freeof moral restraints.Similarly, when the pharmaceutical industry needed to increase the profit marginby selling more blood pressure medication, it simply got the medical industry tochange the definition of high blood pressure. For years, hypertension wasconsidered to be blood pressure that measured above 140/90. In 2003, however, anew condition called pre-hypertension was introduced to describe patients whoseblood pressure lies between 120/80 and 140/90. Voilà! The world now has a newcondition that can be treated with the same old drugs, and the pharmaceuticalindustry has a brand-new market with many more new customers.51[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en190]And when the market became saturated with drugs used for old illnesses, BigPharma also employed the ploy of creating new illnesses. A recent Big Pharmainnovation was to collectively group several common components of normaleveryday life, identify them as symptoms, and officially label them as adisorder.The current list of new maladies identifies Intermittent Explosive Disorder asgetting angry from time to time, Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) as a dysfunctionassociated with any of 150 symptoms affecting a woman’s physiology and behaviorbefore the start of her period, Restless Leg Syndrome as an irresistible urge tomove one’s leg, and Social Anxiety Disorder as being uncomfortable in newsituations. Well, sure, haven’t we all been there and done that?If you’re feeling traumatized by these personalized disorders, thepharmaceutical industry would have you take heart because they have just theprescription for you. While medicine ads command you to “ask your doctor,” weask that you also realize your anxiety may well be the result of those TV adcampaigns to first sell the disorder, then the drug.This is not a hard sell, considering that the American public has beenprogrammed to believe that all ailments, whether a passing upset or chronicissue screaming for attention, can be whisked away by swallowing a magic pill.THE SELF-HEALTH MOVEMENTIn addition to adding costs to our already-overburdened health-care system, eachnewly defined disorder reinforces our acquired perception of being vulnerableand powerless in the struggle for survival. Fortunately, people are beginning toawaken to the myth of their implied frailty. Whether propelled by the high riskof iatrogenic illness or the skyrocketing cost of health care, more and moreindividuals are reclaiming control of their medical destiny.In the early 1980s, the breakthrough book The Aquarian Conspiracy by MarilynFerguson explored the ramifications of introducing new science into society’sinstitutions. Ferguson considered such questions as, “What if we fullyunderstood the implications of an Einsteinian Universe wherein invisible energygoverns matter?” and “What would it mean to have this realization played out ineducation, economics, politics, business and health?”52[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en191]Ferguson predicted an impending radical change—an evolutionary awakening—bymeans of a more cooperative society and a new human agenda. Her messagesupported the long-standing spiritual maxim that what we believe, wemanifest—believing is seeing.When the book came out in 1980, Ferguson was optimistic that institutions wouldembrace this change. However, most have resisted and remained stuck in theirmaterial agenda. Yet, the one area where holistic ideas have taken hold is ourown personal health.Why? Because personal health is, well, personal, and dysfunctions within themedical system hit close to home, either within our own bodies or the bodies ofour loved ones. The many people discarded and failed by the medical system—theuninsured and those diagnosed as terminal—have sought alternatives and, in theprocess, have become proactive managers of their own health.The result is that currently more than half the population of the U.S. visitscomplementary practitioners. The reasons are quite simple: in many cases,alternative healing modalities have proven to be effective, less expensive, andsignificantly safer than the health care provided by allopathic medicine.This realization comes not a moment too soon. We will need all the awareness wecan muster to face the final frontier where the power of money and matter havealready established an “in-post” in the invisible domain of our minds.WEAPONS OF MASS-DISTRACTIONINNER SPACE: THE FINAL FRONTIERBefore the downfall of the Soviet Union, a group of Russian writers touringAmerica found something truly astonishing. No, it wasn’t the magnificentskyscrapers or sleek cars or varieties of laundry soap at the supermarket. Thething they found so remarkable, after reading the newspapers and watching TV,was that almost all the opinions concerning vital issues were the same. One ofthe Russians remarked, “In our country, to get that result we have adictatorship. We imprison people. We tear out their fingernails. Here you havenone of that. How do you do it? What’s the secret?”53[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en192]The secret is the use of weapons of mass-distraction and mass-deception todominate without leaving the telltale marks of a dominator. The final frontierfor planetary control is not outer space but inner mind. As we’ve seen, powerhas evolved from brute force to economic power to the combination of the two.The power meisters of the new Information Age have figured out how to reach theinnermost reaches of your consciousness in order to shape your life without youeven knowing they’ve been there.To begin to understand how that happened, let’s look at the life and history ofa master manipulator of the Information Age, Edward Bernays.HOW THE BRAINWASHING MACHINE GOT STUCK IN SPINCertainly, you’re familiar with public relations. Maybe you or your company hashired a PR firm. Maybe you work for, or even own or manage, one. However, do yourecognize the name Edward Bernays? Probably not. Yet, Bernays is known as the“father of public relations” and is, no doubt, one of the most influentialpeople of recent times.Why? Drawing on the work of his uncle, Sigmund Freud, as well as Russianpsychologist Ivan Pavlov—famous for his salivating dogs—Bernays was the firstperson to understand and apply subconscious programming to the art and scienceof mass communications. Not coincidentally, Bernays’ work spanned much of the20th century, from World War I to the Cold War, and starkly reflected the credothat, in an uncaring random Universe, only matter matters.Bernays’ first job as a young man during World War I was working for theCommittee on Public Information (CPI), directed by George Creel. Bernays wasimpressed by the war propaganda created by that committee and with the newlyemerging mass media’s power to persuade and influence. In addition to theofficial advertising slogan, “Making the world safe for democracy,” World War Ipropagandists gave us the classic poster that depicts a menacing German soldierand the caption, “Beat Back the Hun with Liberty Bonds.”54[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en193] Propaganda poster that helped sell the American public on World War I020 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_020_r1.gif]An important part of every war is to dehumanize the foe to such an extent thatkilling them is of no greater consequence than stepping on a roach.The CPI invented atrocities and recycled lies from previous wars. Theyunderstood, as present day purveyors of negative political ads know, thatnegative ads and stories are powerful because they mobilize an inner rage aboutanything and everything then focus that rage on a handy human target. That’s whyAmerica engaged in a Cold War against the “Red Commies,” and fought hot warsagainst the vile “Huns,” “Japs,” “Slopes,” “Gooks,” and “Rag Heads.”After the war, Bernays turned his attentions to the problems of peace. In hisbook Propaganda, he wrote, “It was, of course, the astounding success ofpropaganda during the war that opened the eyes of the intelligent few in alldepartments of life to the possibilities of regimenting the public mind.”55[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en194] Bernays would have called himself aprogressive, but nonetheless considered the masses a “herd that needed to beled” and wrote frankly about his mission to “control the masses without theirknowing about it.”56 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en195]Have you seen a woman light up a cigarette lately? You can thank the genius ofEdward Bernays for that, too. In the 1920s, a woman smoking was considered to bescandalous. Recognizing an untapped market in changing times, American TobaccoCompany, the makers of Lucky Strike, hired Bernays to do something about it.Bernays, always a great self-promoter, called the result one of the greatest PRevents of the century.For the 1929 Easter Parade in New York and elsewhere, Bernays hired attractiveyoung debutantes to parade as suffragettes while smoking, thus associating themodern and then-rebellious act of smoking with being fashionable andfreedom-loving. Newspapers and newsreels ate this up, and it stood as a turningpoint in the acceptance of women as smokers. To Bernays’ credit, however, oncethe toxic effects of smoking were known, he led the lobbyingeffort—unsuccessfully—to get the Public Relations Society of America to agreenot to work on behalf of tobacco companies.57[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en196]One thing Bernays was not apologetic for, however, was his campaign a generationlater on behalf of the United Fruit Company. He was hired by that company in1951 to help them with a problem in Guatemala. The problem? Democracy. Newlyelected president Jacobo Arbenz had vowed to initiate land reform, thusreturning national wealth to the citizens of Guatemala. As the largest landownerin Guatemala, United Fruit took exception to even the most moderate reforms andhired Bernays to lobby the U.S. government on their behalf.58[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en197]Clearly believing his own propaganda, he framed the new Guatemalan government asa “Communist menace.” In reality, President Arbenz was not a Communist; he was areformer who vowed in his inauguration speech to turn Guatemala into a “moderncapitalist country.”59 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en198] Nonetheless,Bernays arranged junkets for journalists to visit Guatemala, at United Fruit’sexpense, where they witnessed and reported on mocked-up communist riots thatBernays staged for the benefit of his corporate sponsors.60[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en199] Of course, Bernays’ job of convincingthe journalists and the American public was made easier by McCarthyism, whichwas sweeping the U.S. at that time.The result of this campaign? In 1954, a CIA covert action called OperationPBSUCCESS overthrew Arbenz and installed a military dictatorship, initiating areign of terror that would last 28 years. Land reforms were overturned, andUnited Fruit and other corporations got their way. During a series of brutalcoups, rebellions, and repressions, which were precipitated by Bernays’ PRefforts, thousands of Guatemalans died and a million became refugees.61[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en200]It’s easy enough to admire Bernays for his brilliant and creative mind. He wasneither immoral nor unscrupulous, but rather saw propaganda as a scientific wayto influence for the good. The problem is, when all that matters is matter,science can be abused on behalf of material interests. We can only wonder whatEdward Bernays would have said about the Pentagon paying a public relationsfirm, the Rendon Group, $397,000 for a four-month contract in 2001 to help sellthe bombing of Afghanistan.62 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en201]As a result, the new law-of-the-jungle, extra-moral code has been all butemblazoned on stone tablets: Thou shalt lie, cheat, steal, and do anything youcan get away with in pursuit of your own happiness.SO WHAT ARE WE BEING DISTRACTED FROM, ANYWAY?Those in the business of manipulating us understand that, in order to accept andlive by their fear-based precepts, we must first be distracted from ourselvesand our inherent goodness.In spite of all those popular “Looking Out for Number One” and “Swim with theSharks” books, most of us are not willing to treat everyone else like number twojust so we can be number one. Maltreatment of others has to be learned, and themind manipulators know this. Therefore, our society has been silently, andsometimes not-so-silently, programmed to believe that a conscience twinge is asign of weakness.A friend of ours was offered a well-paying job. When she found out the companyproduced and circulated false propaganda, she turned the job down. Her friendschided her and called her a fool, scolding, “Somebody has to get paid to dothat. It might as well be you.” This open chastisement of people who makeconscious decisions on behalf of their own integrity for the common goodindicates that, in the fog of massively meaningless information and the staticof cynicism, many have learned to tune out the inner voice that longs for a moreloving and sane world. That voice has been drowned out by manipulative dialoguethat is little more than two dogmas barking at each other across an imaginarydivide.Could it be that this imaginary divide is something implanted into ourconsciousness to distract us from connecting with each other? To have liberalsand conservatives, fundamentalists and atheists, hippies and rednecks sit acrossfrom one another and speak and listen to each other respectfully would bedangerous for the powers in power. People of apparently opposing positions mightall get struck by en-lightening and discover their common—and uncommon—humanity!In addition to our goodness and our desire to connect with others, there issomething else we are being distracted from, perhaps the most important thing ofall. That is our own power, beginning with our power to reprogram beliefs andmindsets that no longer work. While it may be temporarily convenient to blamethose who have programmed us for their own benefit, once we realize we’ve beenmisled by myth-perceptions, who is responsible then? We are. The noise, thedisinformation, the divisive puppet show are all designed to make sure we pay noattention to the person behind the curtain. But guess what? We are that personbehind the curtain!We unconsciously bought into cultural paradigms during our developmental years.But now we are awakening our consciousness to the power of subconsciousprogramming, and we have the freedom to choose other, more life-enhancingprograms.When we individually and collectively divest ourselves from the acquired beliefthat money rules and matter comes first, we empower our selves to bring thecurtain down on this tired old BS—er, Belief System, that is.As a result, a new paradigm is emerging, and it’s a paradigm that requires ourfull awareness, attention, and active participation—within our selves, of eachother, and of our impending collective enlightenment.Through this chapter, we have become aware of where we are, where we are going,and where we are likely to end up if we keep on treading the same track.Hopefully, the new insights we offer in Spontaneous Evolution will contribute toa cultural turning point because, in good conscience, we can no longer feed thedysfunctional paradigm of dispirited matter. Nor can we go back to the purelyanimistic paradigm of long-ago indigenous peoples. Nor to the lives and times ofthe Founding Fathers and the unadulterated Declaration and Constitution theycreated.There is nowhere to go but forward. And going forward requires that we are readyto go sane."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10GOING SANE“If you can’t take the craziness anymore, there’s only one thing to do. Commityourself to a sane asylum.”— Swami BeyondanandaWELCOME TO THE SANE ASYLUMAs with any recovery program, the road back to sanity begins with acknowledgingthe problem. We have just taken a courageous journey through the shadow land ofdenied dysfunctionality. We have tracked false, obsolete, and unquestionedbeliefs in the primacy of matter, survival of the fittest, genetic control, andrandom evolution to their illogical conclusions. We’ve seen what doesn’t work.By stepping outside the matrix of invisible beliefs that have silently governedand limited our lives, we recognize we have created a world in the distortedimage of our worst fears and unconscious habits. Now that we have seen the awfultruth, the rest of Spontaneous Evolution focuses on the other truth, which isthe awesome opportunity we have as co-creators of our world.Let’s begin the second part of our journey by exploring the idea of sanity.First, being sane and being normal aren’t necessarily the same condition. Sanityis not a trait that can be tabulated by a show of hands. As psychologist andhumanistic philosopher Erich Fromm reminds us, just because millions of peopleshare the same vices doesn’t make these vices virtues.1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en202] Sanity is derived from the Latin wordsanus, which means “healthy.” By sharing a common root, the meaning of sanityand healthy are bound by a strong relationship. That which makes us healthier,makes us more sane. And vice versa.The healthy characteristic of sanity is represented by the soundness of anindividual’s judgment or reasoning—a soundness of mind. Individuals whocontinuously employ impaired judgment and reasoning would be operationallydefined as being insane.In a collective culture, judgments and reasoning are predicated on the perceivedtruths of the basal paradigm. Consequently, if the paradigmatic beliefs of aculture were untrue or flawed, then the population that knowingly operated underthose faulty beliefs would collectively express unsound judgments and reasoning.In such a case, an entire population can be technically judged to be insane.For example, let’s say you hold an old belief that you are genetically destinedto contract breast or prostate cancer. In light of today’s new knowledge ofepigenetics and psychoneuroimmunology, the reasoning you used to reach thatconclusion would be deemed unsound—or totally insane. Fortunately, yourcondition would only be a temporary insanity because, with an awareness of howenvironment, personal perceptions, and lifestyle influence genetic activity andthe immune system, you would be afforded the opportunity to actively influenceand manage your health.As illustrated in this example, cultural myth-perceptions can be personallydisempowering and can lead to the collective insanity that currently threatensour survival. As we’ve suggested, however, civilization’s insanity is only atemporary state, based on conditioning. As the population becomes aware ofnew-edge science’s revisions of the Four Myth-Perceptions of the Apocalypse,they will be offered an opportunity to use judgment and reasoning that are moreharmonious and supportive of our individual and collective survival.Quantum physics reveals that despite our unconscious Newtonian belief inseparation, which would have us believe one particle is a separate entity fromanother particle, everything in the Universe is actually connected in ways wecan hardly imagine. The things we think of as solid and tangible, like matterand time, are nothing more than a set of relationships that only seem to becomereality when experienced through our perceptions.As we will see shortly, the patterns of Nature and, indeed, the patterns of theUniverse repeat themselves at different levels of complexity. This means thatour health doesn’t end at our skin or, for you more metaphysical folks, at theouter edge of the aura. Just as there are 50 trillion cells in our bodies, eachof us is a cell in the body of humanity. As above, so below. Healthy cells,healthy organs, healthy organisms, healthy organizations, healthy biosphere.Now, those are consequences of primal sanity.Sanity cannot exist in an isolated pocket that conveniently denies the presenceof the rest of the world. True sanity must face and embrace the insanity oftoday’s world and, in the process, offer to the temporarily insane a newawareness and a pathway to achieve harmony.As we encourage outbreaks of sanity everywhere, we add more power to a coherentmorphogenetic field that has already begun to change the shape of the world. Anew operating principle for a sane world might be this: life is a cooperativejourney among powerful individuals who can program themselves to createjoy-filled lives.To take the connection theme a step further, sanity is about integratingopposites rather than taking refuge in one polarity or the other. Imagine livinglife with only half your wits about you! No wonder our institutions seem sohalf-witted. Sanity means full-wittedness, and that means bringing forth theholism hidden in the dueling dualities. For example, we may need to return toreal old-time religion, a path that only makes sense when we evaluate the rootmeaning of the word religion.As British political writer David Edwards points out in his book, Burning AllIllusions the word religion derives from the Latin religare, which means “tobind together.” The joining character of ligare is expressed in the wordligament, the structure that binds muscle to bone. While traditionally thisbinding has been linked to obligation—and some would say bondage—Edwards choosesa more sane interpretation. To him, religare means to rejoin the individual withsociety, the world, and the cosmos. This fundamental meaning of religion hasnothing to do with a personal god, theology, or dogma. It is, above all, a termthat implies coherent connection, a connection that doesn’t necessarily requirea priestly intercessor.2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en203]Unfortunately, this deeper meaning of religion got buried under a pile ofdogma-doo. Any spiritual or philosophical ligaments that remained to connecthumanity to the world and cosmos were severed when scientific materialismsuperseded monotheism.Instead of extracting the loving wisdom from both earthly and theistic paths, wethrew the Baby Jesus out with the bath water. We invested our faith in thematerial world and allowed ourselves to believe that power could be a substitutefor, and as good as or better than, love.But now that humankind has recognized that worship of matter is an unmistakablemistake, we are becoming aware that the god of money can neither providehappiness nor end suffering.Sanity, therefore, means that we graduate from a disempowering religion or, forthat matter, a disempowering anything. Sanity means that we grow past the blindobedience of childhood and the blind rebelliousness of adolescence. Sanity meansthat we, as children of God, put aside childish things and finally become adultsof God.ADULTS OF GODThe disillusionment in the post-Holocaust world caused people to seriouslyquestion traditional religious thought. Jews, as well as members of all Westernreligious traditions, found themselves thinking, “If God can allow this, whoneeds God?” Existentialists went a step further and simply proclaimed, “God isdead.”While old time religion still thrived in the American south and rural areas,mainstream culture became more secular. As the 1950s gave way to the ’60s, someinteresting changes began to manifest. More housewives left home to join theworkforce. Television became the all-purpose babysitter and, often, the focus ofhomelife itself. The home-cooked meal eaten at the dining room table gave way tothe TV dinner. For many, synagogues and churches became little more than socialgathering clubs as congregants became more consumed with the values ofmaterialism and getting ahead in the world than they were with spiritualenlightenment from the heavens above.In the late 1960s and early ’70s, the first waves of backlash began to hit theshore. Young people who had left home as hippie-radical wannabes came back acouple years later with beads, a mantra, and an unrecognizable Sanskrit namebestowed upon them by an Indian guru.Others returned as born-again, Bible-thumping Jesus freaks, embarrassing theirmore traditionally religious parents with their passion and idealism for thedoctrinal teachings of Christ, their Savior. Regardless of the direction taken,whether neo-Christian or neo-pagan, these young people had rejected the oldergeneration’s materialistic values and discovered a spiritual vacuum, which theysought to fill.This trend played out differently in mainstream America. Through interviews withthousands of ordinary working people, Rabbi Michael Lerner concluded that, in aculture where money rules and the attitude of “dominate or be dominated”pervades the workplace, the populace experiences a spiritual disheartenment thatis not addressed by either secular society or liberal politics. In his book TheLeft Hand of God, Lerner maintains that, in the 1970s, people began to feel thestrain of unbridled materialism, loss of community, and loss of connection.3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en204]Seeking refuge, these discouraged people flocked to spiritual communities inwhich savvy ministers offered an infusion of two things that had been lacking inthe secular realm: genuine community and a tangible spiritual experience.On the political front, liberals struggled to understand the phenomenon ofReagan Democrats, disheartened individuals who voted for values over their owneconomic interests. Meanwhile, conservative groups, such as the Moral Majorityand the Christian Coalition of America, grew to fill the spiritual vacuum thatthey attributed to culture’s secular humanism rather than to the real cause,materialism itself.As Lerner points out, liberals simply didn’t understand either the importance orthe extent of the heartsickness that swept the heartland. As a result, liberalremedies focused on socioeconomic issues, while the deepest unmet needs of theirconstituents were primarily psycho-spiritual in nature.At the same time, the rise of Christian conservatism further intensified theseparation of religion from secular domains. While the conservative movementprovided a welcome contrast to the values of the marketplace, it alsofatalistically affirmed that was how the world is and how it is meant to be.The bad news of the world was the good news for places of worship where peoplecould get enough spiritual nourishment to fortify them for another week in themeat grinder. However, this spiritual “fix” had a downside. Just as conventionalNewtonian medicine addresses the patient’s symptoms without touching theirproblem, millions of worshippers found refuge from the bad, bad world—withouthaving to do anything about it.Meanwhile, the 1980s and ’90s saw the birth of New Age and new thoughtspirituality, movements that focused on personal growth and largely avoided theworldly issues of social justice and economic balance. The personal growthmovement was just that—personal. In a society based on the primacy of theindividual, the focus was on creating one’s own personal reality. Politics? Whygo there? However, more and more of those who sought to transcend the travailsof life by prematurely ascending began to realize that there has come here.There doesn’t seem to be a way to avoid the reality that we have collectivelycreated!Now, as we take on the prospect of going sane, we must accept our role asresponsible co-creators of our world. Instead of using religious teachings todisempower ourselves, we must stop playing powerless and stupid. As philosopherand student of comparative religions Alan Watts said, “The common error ofordinary religious practice is to mistake the symbol for the reality, to look atthe finger pointing the way and then to suck it for comfort rather than followit.”4 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en205]And that finger is pointing us toward the next level of human evolution. Can weteach those old dogmas new tricks? Here are four sane alternatives to consider:Alternative 1. Move from Original Sin to Original Synergy: As we will discuss inmore detail in Part III, Changing the Guard and Re-Growing the Garden, universallove is unconditional. Like the sun, it shines equally on everyone andeverything. And yet, many in the Western world worship a conditional God whobestows or withdraws love and approval based on whether we follow certainman-made religious dictates. At the extreme, some religious sects practiceself-flagellation by which people literally try to beat the hell out ofthemselves. We refer to these practices as “unsafe sects.”Persistent in the mainstream Christian thought field is the notion of originalsin, which is the precept that all people are born sinners and that sinning isbad.Interestingly, the word sin was originally an archery term that meant missingthe mark and later evolved to mean falling short, or failure to live up to one’spotential. In this sense, we humans are, indeed, sinners because we miss themark and fall short of our potential much of the time, particularly while we arelearning the lessons of life. You could probably say that those rapidly mutatingbacteria struggling to digest the soup they’re in are sinners, too. They keptmissing the genetic mark until they finally found the mutational solution totheir problem.In the linear worldview, Heaven is a destination, far removed from life on thisplanet. In the quantum worldview, where time doesn’t really exist and the onlytime we have is now, a heaven far removed in the future makes no sense.Likewise, all we can do in the now is be, which, in itself, is Heaven. In otherwords, Heaven is a practice, not a place. Perhaps the new spiritual bumpersticker should read, “Not Perfect, Just Practicing Being.”Therefore, in order to go sane, we must shift the focus of religion away frompleasing a conditional cosmic overlord to practicing Heaven on Earth.Alternative 2. Move from a Punishment Model to a Learning Model: If sin meansmissing the mark, this suggests that, with practice, humans should be able tohit the mark more often. This concept calls into question the sanity of oursociety’s focus on punishment.Punishment is unnatural and is not found anywhere in Nature. Imagine the stomachrecovering from an upsetting virus and the esophagus saying, “Virus, shmirus!You’re lazy. And, for sending your regurgitation back up again, no more food foryou!”While punishment for mistakes doesn’t occur naturally, consequences of mistakesdo. For the 95 percent of us who aren’t incorrigible psychopaths, it’s morepractical to focus on learning than punishment. We need to stop punishingourselves or unconsciously asking for punishment.The law of karma and the acceptance of consequences is an evolutionary stepbeyond punishment and self-punishment. Put another way, what if the bacteria,faced with choice of mutate or die, stopped to flagellate themselves each timethey tried a mutation that didn’t work? Would that help them achieve their goalmore quickly? No, we don’t think so.Reframing sin as learning creates compassion for ourselves and for others. Itallows us to focus on the consequences of our lessons, take responsibility, andthen take better aim.Evolution of human culture, as well as individual humans, is a lot like thetrial-and-error process employed by bacteria. Each step, whether we judge it asa brilliant breakthrough or a devastating error, is a mutation along theevolutionary pathway. Consider that Thomas Edison was only successful ininventing the light bulb through the process of trial and error. We move fromvictims to conscious participants when we learn from our errors and then applyour wisdom to act accordingly.Alternative 3. Move from Victim to Free and Willing Participant: Princetonphysicist John Wheeler, a colleague of Albert Einstein, when wrestling with theconcept of humankind’s role in the world came to this conclusion: “We had thisold idea there was a universe out there, and here is man the observer safelyprotected from the universe by a six-inch slab of plate glass. Now we learn fromthe quantum world that even to observe so miniscule an object as an electron wehave to shatter that plate glass . . . so the old word observer simply has to becrossed off the books, and we must put in the new word participator.”5[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en206]Through these words, Wheeler is telling us that the implications of quantumphysics emphasize that we create reality through our perceptions.Extending Wheeler’s notion to its logical conclusion reveals that no particularfuture is a certainty. There are some future scenarios that are probabilitiesand many more that are mere possibilities. The entangled field we all createwith our collective thoughts influences all potential outcomes. What theologiansidentified as free will really represents our power as co-creating participants.Ours is not a top-down Universe where reality is predetermined and dictated fromon high, but a bottom-up Universe where collective thoughts assemble until theyhave the coherence to create one reality—or another. As a pertinent example, thedire condition known as Armageddon is neither an eventuality nor inevitability;it’s a choice. If enough people on the planet believe Armageddon will happen,then, either directly or indirectly, they will likely find a way to make ithappen. However, the same is true for the alternative reality of“Disarmageddon,” if enough people choose that future.So does God or some Divine Presence have any influence in this world? TheologianDavid Ray Griffin suggested that there is, indeed, a divine influence—and itemanates from our own hearts. Through our own free willingness to expresslove—through the simple practice of the Golden Rule—a loving God is mademanifest on Earth. We don’t even have to know what this loving God looks like orif He or She or It exists somewhere out there.The hellish manifestation of the Holocaust, as well as the countless examples ofcollective compassion it inspired, are all expressions related to human choices.What we call the Messiah—“the promised and expected deliverer”—may be ado-it-yourself project, not a done deal from above. It comes down to what wecollectively choose. As theologian Griffin said, “God is persuasive, notcoercive.”6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en207]Alternative 4. Move from Separation to Connection: The Buddhists describe lovingparticipation in the world as compassion, a word that is often misunderstood bythe Western mind. We tend to think of compassion as a nice sentiment, liketaking the time to feel bad about people hwo are starving somewhere. But in theBuddhist tradition, compassion is far more sophisticated in that it shows a deepunderstanding of both quantum physics and cellular biology.In her book A Call to Compassion, Aura Glaser refers to compassion as the“practice of enlightenment.” In other words, enlightenment is something wecultivate in daily life based on a sane understanding of the world and ourrelationship to it. The Bodhisattva, one dedicated to awakening heart and mind,Glaser said, cultivates the “two-pronged mind,” the understanding that love ofself and love of others are one and the same. “Compassion,” she wrote, “is anexpression of human freedom, flowing from a sound intuition of the unity of lifeand all living things.”7 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en208]As we will see, this understanding of the relatedness of all things, as well asacting from that relatedness, offers the key to spontaneous evolution. Writerand lecturer Gregg Braden, author of The Divine Matrix, traveled to Tibet insearch of a way to connect quantum physics and ancient wisdom. Through atranslator, he asked the head of a Buddhist monastery, “What connects us withone another, our world, and our universe? What is the ‘stuff’ that travelsbeyond our bodies and holds the world together?”8[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en209]The geshe, or teacher, answered in only six words: “Compassion is what connectsall things.” The next day, another monk further clarified this statement.“Compassion,” he said, “is both a force in the universe as well as a humanexperience.”9 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en210] In other words,compassion is both the field and the intention we put into that field.To Buddhists, the freely willing choice of any individual to act in a particularway directly impacts humanity as a whole. The reverberation of our actionsthrough time and space is called karma. The perception of selflessness sometimesassociated with Buddhist compassion is actually a divine selfishness where twoselves are served simultaneously. There is the small self of the individual andthe greater Self of collective existence. This ancient belief fully conforms toour evolving awareness that each individual human is a sentient cell in the bodyof humanity and must simultaneously act in the self-interest of the individualand of the whole system. No wonder Glaser refers to Bodhisattvas as “citizens ofthe universe.” 10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en211]Science has brought the world untold gifts. The fact that Gregg Braden and othercitizens of Western civilization have been able to board an airplane and visitan ancient culture half a world away is only one example of the benefits oftechnology. While many shun technology, we see it is an inherent and fundamentalelement of evolution. Consider the fact that cells, in creating the human body,developed many technologies that are far more sophisticated than those yetderived from modern science.The true wisdom dawning today is the realization that science devoid of spiritis limited. We must honor and acknowledge humanity’s technological prowess.However, more importantly, we must also embrace our individual and collectivepower of compassion in order to use technology more wisely and with appropriatehumility. This insight is illuminated in the classic scenario in which ascientist climbs the Mountain of Knowledge, finally reaches the top and seesBuddha quietly sitting at the peak.“What are you doing here?” asks the scientist.“What took you so long?” replies the Buddha, smiling.EMBRACE OUR POWER WITH ALL DUE HUMILITYThe key to maintaining sanity in an insane world is to understand and maintainour relationship with reality. The reality we are talking about is not thediversionary reality of reality TV but the real reality that connects everyonewith everything. As humans, we are not all-powerful, but we are all powerful.Understanding both the vastness and the limitations of that power and thenacting accordingly, is the key to having our individual sanity contribute to themanifestation of a saner world.We are neither subjects of a vengeful God nor victims of a random Universe. Justas every cell in our body holds all our genetic information, each of us holds akey to collective humanity. The program for a loving future is here; it onlyneeds to be engaged through our awareness and our conscious actions. Thoseso-called sins we lamented about are nothing but mistakes—mutations if you will.Like bacteria facing the life-or-death issue of mutate or die, we humans can nolonger sustain ourselves with the current form of insanity.We have the power to choose new responses. While some of those responses couldbe viewed as mistakes or dead ends, eventually they will all collectively leadus in the direction of our emergent selves.As adults of God, we now understand that healing the world comes from the insideout. Everything we do individually to become more coherent and compassionatewill reverberate in the field like ripples on a pond. Like begets like. As yousow, so shall you reap.Coherent and compassionate people have no need to dominate others, rather, theyseek to empower cooperation rather than competition in everyone. Why? Because acoherent, harmonious world would be in everyone’s best self-interest. Perhapsthis is what Jesus meant by “the meek shall inherit the earth.”For those already involved with personal and spiritual growth, holistic health,and new thought, it is now time to apply that knowledge and wisdom to the worldat large. It’s time to move past the limitations of seeking our personal goodfortune in isolation. It makes no sense to have a congruent life but not acongruent world. In fact, it’s time for the self-empowerment movement to take anemergent leap front and center to test spiritual principles in collectivereality.Some 80 years ago, a 32-year-old would-be businessman stood ready to end hislife. He had gone bankrupt, had failed at every venture, and had come to believethat his wife and family—and the world—would be better off without him. As hecontemplated throwing himself into Lake Michigan, a wild thought crossed hismind. It seemed like a waste to throw away his life. Because he was about todiscard it anyway, why not donate his life to science? Why not give his life tothe world and live it as a scientific experiment?That young man was Buckminster Fuller, and he lived another 55 years after thatepiphany. He became a noted inventor and philosopher who gave the world thegeodesic dome and the concept of Spaceship Earth. Perhaps in his life there is acue for the rest of us. Maybe we are given our lives not just to live them, butto donate them to the world in a grand experiment to see if, together, we canachieve thrival. Like the bacteria’s race against time, the human race isracing, too. The question is, “Will we achieve critical mass before we reachcritical massacre?”If the physicists are right, the only thing we can be certain of is uncertainty.Reality doesn’t happen until we decide to make it happen through our collectivebeliefs. But we can be certain of our own loving intention. Our grand experimentinvolves applying that loving intention in our lives and our world. Put anotherway, the best way to accept the uncertainty in the world is with certainty inour hearts. We cannot be certain about the results, but we can be certain aboutour intentions, which, in turn, will affect the results. As Descartes didn’tsay, “I love, therefore I am.”As ancient spiritual traditions, from the Vedas to the cabala, reveal, theeveryday world we think we see is an illusion. And as quantum physicists arecoming to realize, there is, indeed, a field that projects what we call realityonto matter. The separation between us and them or between us and Nature that weso vividly experience in our reality is an illusion held in place by ourbeliefs.Going sane means withdrawing our participation from this collectively createdillusion. Going sane means that we stop enabling insanity with rationalizations,denials, wishful thinking, and misplaced hopes in someone or something outsideourselves.Going sane is a choice. The good news is: there is a way to get there. All weneed to provide is the will.Based on the organization of a healthy, thriving human body, this model offersus a way to change the guard and re-grow the Garden. That is, we see that muchof what we have been guarding ourselves from is based on programmedmisperceptions and ancient memories.Hopefully, that sane world will become so vivid by the end of SpontaneousEvolution that the bridge from here to there, or actually, from there to here,will become plainly manifest."},{"pageContent":"PART IIICHANGING THE GUARD AND RE-GROWING THE GARDEN“Why don’t we go for Heaven on Earth, just for the hell of it?”— Swami Beyondananda There’s good news, and there’s bad news. The bad news: civilization, as we knowit, is about to end. Now, the good news: civilization, as we know it, is aboutto end.True, the seemingly insurmountable crises that currently challenge our existencecan be taken as an obvious portent of civilization’s imminent demise. However,below the turmoil evident on the surface, there is an even deeper, more profoundreason as to why our civilization is ending. The core beliefs upon which we havebuilt our world are leading us to our own extinction—that’s the bad news.The good news is that new-edge science has drastically revised our currentparadigm’s core beliefs. By definition, revisions of paradigmatic beliefsinevitably provoke a profound transformation of civilization as its populationassimilates the newer, more life-sustaining awareness.More good news is that ours is not the first Western civilization to rise andthen fall out of favor. Three earlier versions of civilization—animism,polytheism, and monotheism—preceded and contributed to today’s culture ofscientific materialism. So, there is precedent for the furthering of ourevolution.As with any living organism, the birth of a civilization is initiallycharacterized by a developmental period during which novel cultural ideas areintroduced to the mainstream public. As a society matures, effectivelife-enhancing beliefs become canonized and perceived as cultural law, and theseconcretized beliefs lead to rigidity in a society’s behavioral patterns. The lifespan of a civilization begins with new development, peaks with rigidity,and ends with decline.021 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_021_r1.gif]Over time, a society’s fixed beliefs inevitably precipitate irresolvableenvironmental challenges. At this stage of its life cycle, the culturalmainstream’s inherent rigidity expresses itself as an active resistance tochange, even when confronted with life-threatening crises. Inflexibility in atime of upheaval precipitates a rapid decline of the aging society.Today’s world situation reveals that we are deep in the throes of globallife-threatening challenges that are directly linked to civilization’smisperceived societal truths. We are entering a transition period between acivilization that is dying and one that is struggling to be born. From the ashesof the old civilization arises a new one—we are living the story of the Phoenix.Every day, increasing numbers of people are awakening to the reality thatcivilization, as we know it, is going to end. This conclusion isn’t exactly asurprise; a world in chaos with overwhelming crises can be taken as a reliablewarning of imminent upheaval. Now that we have been forewarned, are we forearmedto deal with the exigencies of such a massive social upheaval? Perhaps a moreimportant question might be, “In the inevitable transformation of our world,will we be able to avert the trauma of revolution and, instead, opt for globalhealing through evolution?”THE FORK IN THE ROADWe are now speeding toward our third transit of the balance point between thespiritual realm and the material realm. What lies before us when we arrive willbe defined by our choice between two alternative paths. We may choose to stay inthe same familiar world of dueling dualities, wherein religious fundamentalistsand reductionistic scientists continue to polarize the public. This path willobviously continue to take us toward the same destination we are heading tonow—imminent extinction.Or, as we return again to the balance point, we may choose to resolve ourdifferences by seeking harmony over polarity. By combining formerly factiouselements into a unified functional whole, we can open the door, transcendhistoric dualities, and experience an evolution that will provide for ahigher-functioning, more-sustainable version of humanity.The potential behind such a seemingly miraculous resolution is not based on somepie-in-the-sky, Pollyanna thinking. The positive vision supporting this probablefuture is inherent in the wisdom offered by civilization’s basal paradigm.However, we are not speaking of the wisdom of the current civilization’sparadigm, a belief system with flawed myth-perceptions that directly contributeto today’s global chaos. Rather, we are speaking of a new basal paradigm, onebased on an integration of new science and ancient spiritual wisdom. While noofficial name has yet been designated to describe the next version ofcivilization, we will identify the new basal paradigm as holism.As with civilization’s previous paradigms—animism, polytheism, monotheism, andscientific materialism—holism must provide acceptable answers to the threeperennial questions prior to becoming civilization’s official basal paradigm:1. How did we get here?2. Why are we here?3. Now that we’re here, how do we make the best of it?HOW DID WE GET HERE? THE HOLISTIC VIEWCosmologists agree that before the appearance of matter the Universe wascomprised of an entangled matrix of invisible energy referred to as the field.After the Big Bang, estimated to have occurred 15 billion years ago, physicalmatter precipitated out of that energy field and has been entangled with it eversince.The principles of quantum mechanics emphasize the primacy of energy fields intheir influence over matter. Consequently, the Universe’s matter is organized byinformation, represented as energy patterns contained within the field. Theprinciples of quantum mechanics lend support to Socrates’ notion that invisibleforms, or souls, are responsible for shaping the physical realm.Because the field’s information existed prior to the material world, we caneasily entertain the notion of creationism in which an organism’s form existedin the field as a defined energy pattern before the physical organism appearedon the planet.Over a period lasting billions of years, Earth’s physical matter graduallyassembled into complex physical forms that complement the field’s invisibleinformation patterns. In linear time, the first living organisms to appear onthe planet were simple bacteria. Through the use of adaptive mutation mechanismsand epigenetic modifications, primitive cells were able to select and altertheir genetic code in order to better accommodate their environmental niches.Heredity-modifying processes provided living organisms with a mechanism tocontinuously adapt to new and ever-changing environments.The time-dependent process of assembling physical matter into cells followed bythe assembly of cells into complex organisms, such as humans, represents thelinear process of evolution. Therefore, it appears that the origins of thebiosphere’s organisms are derived from both creation and evolution processes.In a paradigm of holism, former polar opposites are revealed to be entangledparts within one whole system. This especially applies to the dueling polaritiesof creation and evolution, processes that are inseparably entangled in the danceof life. Holism recognizes that both the creationist notion of a pre-existingpattern and the evolutionist theory of how this pattern is manifested over timeare pieces of the cosmic puzzle that, when put together, approximate reality.As we will learn in Chapter 11, Fractal Evolution, Nature has utilized ageometric formula to shape the dynamic assembly of communities of livingsystems. In contrast to Darwinian theory, which suggests evolution is random,the new science implies that evolution represents a purposeful process in whichindividual organisms survive by adaptation and thrive by becoming members of alarger community. Each participant is an interdependent member of the community,making a contribution to the whole and, in return, reaping the benefits.WHY ARE WE HERE? THE HOLISTIC VIEWAs mentioned earlier, James Lovelock proposed the Gaia hypothesis in 1972. Hetheorized that the physical Earth and the living biosphere form a complexinteracting system that can be considered as a single organism. The hypothesisstates that the biosphere has a regulatory influence on Earth’s environment,balancing and buffering the physical characteristics of the planet in order tosustain life.Organisms introduced to an environment modify and disturb the originalconditions of their ecological niche by engaging in life-sustaining biologicalactivities such as eating, breathing, and eliminating waste. In an effort torestore environmental balance, Nature employs adaptive mutations and epigeneticmechanisms to shape the evolution of subsequent new species whose lifeactivities contribute to the restoration of harmonious balance in the ecosystem.The Gaia hypothesis emphasizes Nature’s tendency to move toward balance andharmony. A fundamental example of Gaian harmony—one so obvious that we oftenfail to see it—is the entangled relationship between plants and animals. Plantsrequire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and excrete oxygen as a waste product,whereas animals breathe in oxygen for respiration and excrete carbon dioxide asa waste product. One couldn’t survive without the other.Humans, like every other organism in the biosphere, are here to supportenvironmental balance, to buffer it, to sustain it, and to encourage harmony.Among Earth’s organisms, human beings are unique in that we are consciouslyaware of our evolutionary process and potential. We are here to use our evolvedawareness to support environmental harmony.We can view the environment in terms of a delicately balanced seesaw. When a neworganism is added at one end, the seesaw becomes unbalanced. To re-createbalance, Nature will either eliminate the original organism or evolve acounterbalancing new organism at the other end of the seesaw.The impact a species has on the environment’s balance is directly related to howclose it is to the seesaw’s fulcrum. A species straddling the fulcrum canreadily alter the balance by simply shifting its weight toward one side or theother. Humanity has evolved to the point of, essentially, standing on thefulcrum of evolution’s seesaw, and we must recognize that we exert a trulypowerful influence over the balance of Nature.Ignorance of our responsibility to the planet’s welfare has contributed to anumber of life-threatening ecological crises. In light of new insightsconcerning humanity’s role in planetary evolution, we must become consciouslyaware of our impact on the environment. We must redirect our awareness towardreduction of our environmental footprint so that we shift our influence towardgreater sustainability.As Lovelock suggests, the biosphere represents a giant living and quite awareorganism comprised of all the world’s cells, plants, and animals. Every cell isan aware sentient entity. Through the evolution of cellular communities, cellswere able to greatly amplify the power of their awareness, and, in the end,create the advanced intelligence of the human mind. The history of evolutionmaps the developmental advancement of awareness through the expansion ofcommunity. Perhaps that evolutionary directive—accumulating awareness throughexpanding community—offers a clear direction for our currently evolvingcivilization.NOW THAT WE’RE HERE, HOW DO WE MAKE THE BEST OF IT? THE HOLISTIC VIEWWe make the best of life by making the best life we can—for ourselves, forothers, and for our planet. For insight on how to accomplish that, we need onlylook within our own bodies: a model community of 50 trillion individual cellsthat have learned to live and work in harmony. We humans can direct ourconscious awareness to learn how to do what our cells already do—create acivilization endowed with health, harmony, and bliss.Our destiny as human beings at the fulcrum of Earth’s seesaw is to use ourawareness to create sustainable technologies that enhance our survival andlessen our environmental impact. In Chapter 12, Time to See a Good Shrink, wewill take a journey beneath our skin and observe exactly how societies of cellshave created successful, life-enhancing communities. Human hubris would have usbelieve that we are Earth’s most highly intelligent creatures and that all otherorganisms are less intelligent. In fact, many scientists might argue thatprimitive organisms, such as cells, display no intelligence at all.This might be a good place to recognize this important fact: cellular technologycreated us! In designing the human body, cellular communities developed amazingtechnologies that were needed to manipulate, regulate, and precisely controltheir environment. Interestingly, most of the advanced technologies created bycells are still beyond the grasp of human science and awareness. Therefore, weargue, in contrast, that we have a lot to learn from cells.Technology is an integral element in the evolutionary process. Considering thatwe are following an evolutionary path similar to the one taken by our cells, weare also destined to use technology to ensure our survival. This is counter tothe arguments of Luddites who would have us forsake all of our technologicalknow-how and return to the Garden as hairless pets.Actually, our evolutionary destiny is to re-inhabit the Garden, only this timein full awareness of our journey. In the same manner that cellular technologyprovided for the success of cellular communities in a human body, we mustrecognize that human technology will provide for the success of humancommunities on our planet.The chart below compares the beliefs of the current basal paradigm of scientificmaterialism with that of the evolving paradigm of holism. As is evident, theanswers to the perennial questions are profoundly different, and the consequenceis that civilization, as we know it, is about to divert from its present courseof apparent self-extinction. The perennial questions, as answered by the scientific materialism paradigm andthe holism paradigmPerennial Question Scientific Materialism HolismHow did we get here? Random actsof heredityVia a combination of creation and adaptive evolutionWhy are we here?No other reason than to go forth and multiplyTo tend the Garden and acquireawareness for humanity’s evolutionNow that we’re here, how do we make the bestof it? Live by the law of the JungleLive in balance with Nature recognizing thatall is connectedWhen civilization evolves into the paradigm of holism, we will have come fullcircle to reacquire the awareness once held by our animistic forebears. We willonce again realize oneness with our earthly environment, and, at the same time,we will honor the influence of what we call field, or spirit, that shapes ourmaterial existence in every moment.The human population is awakening with a rapidly growing awareness that the keyto a healthy, happy life in a thriving Garden requires us to recognize that weare each and all cells in the body of humanity, that we are conscious andconscientious caretakers and cultivators.The Universe appears to be in an ever-unfolding spiral of evolutionarydevelopment. Having reflected on the past and examined the present, we are nowready to consider the parameters of a healthier future. We stand ready to rejectthe programming of habitual fear that has enslaved us and inhibited our growth.We are learning that the path to healing and breakthrough necessitates that weunite polarities that have fractured civilization. Humans across the planet areon the threshold of accepting their “humanifest destiny” as consciousco-creators.A STATE OF “EMERGENT SEEING”As we’ve already seen, the old paradigm beliefs exert their influence invisiblythrough every institution in society as well as in beliefs firmly embedded inour own psyche. For transformation to take place, a critical mass of us mustdivest ourselves of these obsolete beliefs and then invest our awareness andactivities so as to be in harmony with the new emergent paradigm.But in order to re-grow the Garden, we must first change the guard. Those datedbeliefs of scientific materialism that stand guard at our doors of perceptionmust be retired and relieved of duty. We must welcome a new basal paradigm, onethat is based on an integration of new science and ancient spiritual wisdom, onethat weaves old dualities into a unified holistic worldview.In Part III, we move from our current state of emergency and declare our desirefor a state of “emergent seeing.” We offer a story to help us emerge from ourlimiting identity as separate individual cells and come to recognize ourselvesas unique and important interdependent cells in the body of humanity.In addition to Chapter 11, Fractal Evolution, and Chapter 12, Time to See a GoodShrink, Part III contains four prescriptive and visionary chapters that applyfractal awareness and the wisdom of the cells to human economics, politics,individual consciousness, and collective spiritual understanding. Each chapter,built on the truths uncovered in new-edge biology and quantum physics, offersinsights on choices that increase the likelihood of civilization realizing alife-sustaining spontaneous evolution.The One Suggestion: Maybe Ten Commandments are too many. Maybe all we need isone suggestion: “We’re all in this together.” Chapter 13 is an exploration ofthe field, the mysterious and invisible shaping force that connects us all,which reveals that we truly are all entangled particles in the same field ofdreams. This chapter affirms that humanity’s survival in a holistic paradigm ispredicated on adopting the Golden Rule as a universal operating system.A Healthy Commonwealth: We are cells in the body of humanity as well as citizensof the biosphere. Consequently, we must declare that economy and ecology are oneand the same. In fact, the English words economy and ecology both originate fromthe Greek oikos, which means “household, house, or family” and was, as itrelates to both financial and environmental wellness, the basic unit of societyin most ancient Greek city-states.Chapter 14, A Healthy Commonwealth, provides new science and sustainable trendsthat offer a promise of a new economics that is harmonious with the planet andwith true human needs. That’s good oikos.Healing the Body Politic: Chapter 15, Healing the Body Politic, prescribes aholistic treatment that contrasts the conventional Newtonian approach oftemporarily masking symptoms through practices such as political repression.Instead, we consider a new system of justice—a balance—that stops us fromwasting energy by suppressing symptoms and, instead, liberates that energy foractually solving problems. By accessing the healthy central voice of We thePeople, we bring to light vital, life-affirming elements that have been missingin our political conversations.A Whole New Story: Chapter 16, A Whole New Story, focuses on the processesneeded to release and complete the old story so that we can begin a new one. Thenew story integrates opposing polarities to maximize the benefit of eachposition while moving beyond static positions to solve problems at a higherlevel.As we free ourselves from limiting and self-destructive programs on both theindividual and cultural level, we become free to write a new story. What wouldour world look like if we declared an end to the old story of domination, greed,fear, and hatred? What if we dismissed all old grievances in a worldwideceremony and declared ourselves healed? What if we finalized the old story byconcluding, “and they lived happily ever after?”Well . . . we could begin living happily ever after right now—immediately—bybringing our own happiness with us.The possibilities we could unleash are beyond imagination!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11FRACTAL EVOLUTION“Once we understand the math of evolution, we will understand the aftermath aswell.”— Swami BeyondanandaIS THERE A FUTURE IN FUTUROLOGY?In Part I, What If Everything You Know Is Wrong, and Part II, FourMyth-Perceptions of the Apocalypse, we provided a brief history of Westerncivilization as seen through the lens of an evolving basal paradigm. Our focuswas on the nature of how personal beliefs influence our biology and how aculture’s paradigmatic beliefs shape the fate of a civilization. In Part III, weleave the old stories behind as we weave the elements of a new story that willguide us through the uncharted territory of a truly new millennium.When compiling the story of how we got here, we were afforded the armchairopportunity of assessing history through the lens of 20/20 hindsight. But PartIII introduces a completely different kind of story—a vision into the future.Offering information as to what will be is clearly a different endeavor thanproviding an historical analysis. We are now entering into the domain ofprediction, or, more formally, Futurology: a systematic forecasting of thefuture based on an assessment of societal trends.A prediction may range from an outright guess to an astute inference. By itsnature, a guess is based on insufficient information and, consequently,represents a chancy prediction. In contrast, an inference is based on evidenceand reasoning and, therefore, represents a prediction that has a greaterprobability of being correct. Yet, the accuracy of an inference is dependent onperceived evidence and reason. Obviously, a presumably solid inference cantotally miss the mark if the beliefs upon which it is founded are inaccurate ordistorted.The Ford Motor Company provided a powerful example of envisioning the futurethrough a distorted lens. In 1958, Ford unveiled a $400 million venture designedto capture the public’s attention and purchasing dollars. Using the best MadisonAvenue marketing research, Ford designed a new line of automobiles touted as thecar having “more YOU ideas.” The Ford Edsel was engineered to complement publictrends in styling, and its advertising was scientifically designed to elicit carbuyers’ motivations.But the Edsel became the most famous marketing disaster in history. In fact, thename has since become synonymous with commercial fiascos, and other similarlyill-fated products are often comically dismissed as being Edsels. Marketingexperts hold the Edsel up as a supreme example of corporate America’s inabilityto understand the nature of the American consumer. One of the more interestingfactors for the failure, as stated in TIME magazine’s list of “50 Worst Cars,”was that: “Cultural critics speculated that the car was a flop because thevertical grill looked like a vagina. Maybe. America in the ’50s was certainlyphobic about the female business.”Futurists who use conventional beliefs and reasoning to target a predictionsometimes widely miss the mark. Like an archer, they sin. The gravity of aprognosticator’s sin can be measured in terms of the number of people who aremisled. Consider the ramifications of a futurist’s sin when that futurist is apolitician, economist, or sociologist responsible for guiding the fate ofcivilization.In a tragic example of misperception and misguidance, Secretary of DefenseDonald Rumsfeld assured the world of a fast victory in Iraq lasting no more thana few weeks. We now know that Rumsfeld’s sin, based on distorted evidence andreasoning, has cost, and continues to cost, the United States dearly in what hasbeen the Edsel of all wars!A good futurist has the ability to assess data and identify inherent patterns.Therefore, pattern recognition is a primary component in the learning processand a necessity in projecting the future.Below is an opportunity to test your skills at being a futurologist. Study thefour sequences below and predict the number or letter that will fill the blank:1. 13 - 26 - 39 - 52 - 65 - ___2. C - F - I - L - O - R - ___3. 7 - 3 - B - 16 - 2 - 9 - C - 0 - 4 - H - 1 - 1 - ___4. 3 - 1 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 9 - 2 - 6 - ___Answers only become obvious after we observe a recognizable pattern. In sequence(1), the pattern reveals that each new number is derived by adding 13 to theprevious number. In sequence (2) the pattern represents listing every thirdletter in the alphabet. If your answers for (1) and (2) were respectively, 78and U, congratulations—you have seen into the future!However, problems arise in predicting the future in sequence (3) because,apparently, there is neither rhyme nor reason to the pattern. Consequently, anyanswer you use to fill in the blank, by definition, represents an outrightguess. Because this is a random equation, philosophically, any guess can beeither right or wrong—and, as befitting a quantum Universe, the accuracy of thatguess is dependent, of course, upon the observer.For most readers, sequence (4) might seem to be yet another random sequence.Surprisingly, the answer is 5. Perhaps you were sufficiently astute to haverecognized this apparent non-pattern as the specific sequence of numbers thatrepresent the mathematical formula for Pi (π). Equation (4), therefore,underscores a relevant concern for futurologists, that is, some components ofNature that appear to be random are actually chaotic in that they possess anunderlying, but as yet, unrecognized pattern.This simple exercise illustrates three fundamentally important points concerningfuturology: first, if a pattern can be recognized, then the accuracy ofpredicting a future event is relatively high. Second, if events are found to berandom, then all predictions are essentially guesses with an accuracy based onchance. Third, the apparent absence of a pattern does not imply the absence of apattern. Some patterns are obvious, some patterns are not readily recognizable,and some things simply don’t have a pattern!Survival is dependent on pattern recognition. As a primal example, humankind’searly knowledge of Nature’s fundamental patterns included the day-night cycle,the lunar cycle, and the sidereal yearly cycle with four seasons. The ability toobserve and forecast celestial patterns was fundamental to the development ofagriculture and further evolution of civilization because this awarenessprovided humans with the means and motivation to plan future actions, such asplanting crops in the spring then harvesting and storing food for the comingwinter.Likewise, early human cultures were able to connect the biological patterns ofbirth, growth, and death with the planet’s cyclic seasonal patterns. Thesepatterns were so important to survival that civilizations built great edificesand temples, such as Stonehenge, to observe and mark the transit of the sun,moon, and stars.Today, the calendar serves as our monument to these daily, seasonal ,and yearlypatterns. With a calendar, a person anywhere in the world can know, for example,the propagation season for turtles laying their eggs on a Galapagos beach or theday swallows return to Capistrano.When early humans connected astronomical patterns with patterns of humanbehavior, they recognized a link between Earth’s cycles and human physiology.For example, the fact that the lunar cycle and a woman’s menstrual cycle areeach 28 days long is not a coincidence.This link between the heavens and human biology and behavior led ancientsocieties to found the science and art of astrology. The practice in astrologyof observing patterns and predicting human behavior proved to be so valuablethat, from earliest recorded history to the present day, government rulers andleaders have consulted with astrologers to divine the future of their nations.With the introduction of new cultural truths by the monotheists and, later, bythe scientific materialists, civilization’s awareness of Earth arts receded intohistory, relegated to the status of fanciful myths. Science today considersthese ancient practices to be beliefs that are simply beyond the laws of Nature.And our current science-based society totally dismisses the ancient diviningarts of seeing into the future as primitive metaphysical rituals.But, perhaps, as new-edge science is revealing, these Earth practices are onlybeyond the limited vision of conventional scientists who still perceive theworld through the flawed lenses of the four myth-perceptions. Fortunately, wehave among us aboriginal descendents who are still able to speak the language ofthe planet. But, the populations of these Earth stewards are rapidlydiminishing, so we must act quickly to ensure that their wisdom will not belost.The character of today’s civilization is primarily shaped by what scientificmaterialism presents as paradigmatic truths, which are really the beliefsoriginally adopted after Darwin introduced his version of evolution theory inthe mid-19th century. In spite of their inherent faults, these perceivedscientific truths nonetheless provided an important conceptual framework thatenabled the development of technology and the growth of civilization. But, whilethese flawed beliefs once provided the miracles of our modern world, theirshortcomings are a threat to human survival today.The critical problems currently facing humanity are symptoms that reflect ourinability to project into the future. Like a wayward rocket, civilization hasbeen careening from one disaster to another, showing itself to be a forcefulvector with no intentional direction.Conventional wisdom is a contributing factor to history’s erratic and oftencalamitous course. While this commonly accepted form of reasoning is used toenvision patterns and project futures, it can also be distorted by faultyperceptions, especially when an accurate awareness of energy fields, geneticdeterminism, and the nature of evolution is required.Therefore, in order to accurately see where we are going, we must firstunderstand the patterns of how we got here. However, when consultingconventional science about inherent patterns in evolution, we must recognizethat limiting Darwinian beliefs concerning random evolution will significantlydistort their answers.How does conventional science explain how we got here?Oh—through billions of years of gradual evolution driven by random mutations andgenetic accidents.So, if that’s how we got here, then can we predict where evolution will take us?Perhaps on a joy ride . . . to Hell?Seriously, if evolution is driven by random events, how can anyone predict wherewe are going? Any prediction, by definition, would be a sheer guess. Forexample, consider the fact that when the home computer rage first hit thepublic, futurists projected that, in the centuries ahead, humans would evolvesmaller bodies and bigger heads from sitting at computer terminals all day. But,if we look at the current epidemic in obesity and dwindling intelligence, we seethat that prediction was an Edsel of a guess!WHEN IT COMES TO INVENTION, NECESSITY IS A MOTHERIn the face of global crises, new-edge science is introducing a newlife-sustaining story, a different way of looking at the world. When we replacecivilization’s current faulty paradigmatic myths with the revised awarenessoffered by modern science, a whole new world of possibilities emerges. Seenthrough a corrected paradigm lens, unrecognized patterns come into sharp focus.For example, consider the question of humanity’s evolution in light of newscientific insights. In contrast to the Darwinian assertion that evolution isdriven by random mutations, Cairns described beneficial mutations that certainlyseem to be intentional. The hypersomatic mutation process provides a mechanismof evolution through which organisms are innately capable of adapting to dynamicchanges in the environment by actively changing their genetic code.Leading-edge evolution theorists have recently revived the 19th century conceptof ecological speciation, which suggests the evolution of new species is drivenby ecological pressures. These theorists point out that narrow, regionalvariations in an environment, such as in microclimate zones, influence anorganism to rapidly adapt and change its biological shape and behaviors as wellas its ability to survive and thrive in that altered environment. For example,we can split an identical population of either fish or snails into two groupsand introduce each group into separate but identical environments. If weintroduce predators that feed off fish or snails into one of the environmentsand follow the fate of both populations, we can observe how environmentalalterations—the predators—profoundly influence the course of evolution withinthe fish or snail species. Similar results have been observed in naturalecosystems.1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en212]Fish or snails in the altered environment will mature and reproduce earlier, andconsequent changes in their structure and behavior will likely lead to differentbehavior patterns than those expressed by their unchallenged cohorts in the safeenvironment. The two subpopulations of species could even further disconnectfrom one another if some are forced by predation to live and feed in formerlyunfrequented parts of their environment. Regardless of whether these changes areintroduced by epigenetic mechanisms or by adaptive mutations, environmentallyinduced alterations may lead to such divergent developmental paths thatorganisms may no longer be able to recognize or breed with other members of the,previously, same species.2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en213]The influence of environment in shaping evolution was recently demonstrated inlong-term genetic studies on microbes. Trying to determine the role of chance inevolutionary development, researchers asked, “If the history of life could bereplayed from the same starting point, would it unfold differently?” Afterintroducing genetically identical bacteria into separate test tubes, each ofwhich contained the same stressful environment, they followed the evolution ofbacteria in each tube through 24,000 generations.Researchers found that “these miniature adaptive radiations unfold in the sameway every time, governed by the available environmental niches.”3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en214] In some experiments, adaptations indifferent cultures were derived from different types of genetic processes. Inother studies, the adaptations in different cultures were surprisinglyreproducible, right down to the specific pattern of alterations in ATCGsequences in DNA.Regardless of the path they took, microbes in each tube ultimately adapted tothe same environment, generally using the same pathways. This indicates thatidentical populations faced with similar conditions follow parallel courses ofevolution. Therefore, through this experiment and the others described above,new-edge science reveals that evolution is directly influenced by environmentaldeterminants and, apparently, is not random.If evolution is shaped by environmental conditions, as these experimentssuggest, then, with enough awareness of environmental conditions, we should beable to envision the course of evolution. The question then becomes, “Can wepredict environmental conditions in a dynamic world?”While dynamic systems appear to behave randomly, Lorenz revealed that, withenough resolution of environmental data, even these systems are predictable.Dynamic systems express deterministic chaos, or, simply, chaos. In contrast tosystems that display random behaviors, the fates of chaotic systems arepredictable and, as Lorenz experienced, highly sensitive to initial influences.DÉJÀ VU ALL OVER AGAINIn addition to sensitivity, dynamical, or chaotic, systems are alsocharacterized by another fundamental trait: iteration. Iteration simply meansrepetition of a pattern, be it a physical structure or a behavioral process. Forexample, if you take pictures of a coastline from a satellite, from an airplane,from a boat, and from standing on the shore, then if you trace the shape of thecoast’s outline in each image, all the tracings will exhibit a self-similarpattern. Likewise, at any level of its organization, a tree is made out ofrepeating self-similar patterns in a range of different sizes: the shape of thetrunk is similar to the shape of a branch, which is similar to that of a twig.In mathematics, iteration represents the repeated application of the samefunction or formula in which the output of each step is used as the input forthe next repeated, or iterated, step. For example, consider this iteratedequation:The length of a line ÷ 2 = ____For example:12 inches ÷ 2 = 6 inchesRepeat the process:6 inches ÷ 2 = 3 inches3 inches ÷ 2 = 1.5 inches1.5 inches ÷ 2 = .75 of an inch.75 of an inch ÷ 2 = .375 of an inchAnd so on with each resulting line being one-half the length of the previousline until such point as your pencil point is too large to draw the smaller andsmaller lines. Yet, the iterating equation can still continue. You could use amicroscope to see even smaller lines. And, if you were to use a computer youcould iterate—repeat—this equation infinitely, creating infinitely smaller andsmaller lines.In this iterated equation, the use of a one-dimensional line merely produces asimple line of shorter length. However, if we apply an iterated equation to atwo-dimensional object, such as a triangle, the results of iterating even asimple formula produce great complexity.The creation of a more complex, two-dimensional Koch Snowflake is built bystarting with a simple equilateral triangle and then applying this iteratedequation:On each surface, attach a new equilateral triangle; the perimeter of thattriangle is equal to the length of the surface on which it sits.By repeating this formula indefinitely, we can add smaller and smaller trianglesto each newly created surface. The Koch Snowflake illustrates that a simple geometric shape, such as anequilateral triangle, repeated multiple times, creates other figures ofincreasing complexity.022 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_022_r1.gif]In the illustration above, the initial seed triangle A is light gray. Theshading of the triangles becomes successively darker in each of the next threeiterations (Figures B, C, and D). The complexity of the process is revealed inFigure E in which all the triangles are merged into a single image. As isevident by comparing the simple starting triangle with the result of each repeatof the equation, subsequent iterations vastly increase the complexity of theform.The Koch Snowflake expresses an iterated pattern created by using atwo-dimensional object. But dramatically more complex structures are producedwhen the iterated formula utilizes three-dimensional objects.Consider the fact that all the variations of animals on this planet, from wormsto sperm whales, represent multi-dimensional systems built from essentiallyiterated patterns of self-similar cells. These complex systems of livingorganisms, as well as the environment in which they are evolving, are chaotic.Yet, because of mathematical modeling, they are also—are you ready forthis?—predictable!This concept of predictable chaos is apparently what Galileo had in mind when hepenned, “Mathematics is the language with which God has written the Universe.”FRACTALS—MATH AND AFTERMATHConsequently, all we need to do is find out which mathematics was used to createthe Universe and we will be able to understand how we got here and where we arebound. Because we are trying to discern environmental patterns, specifically asthey relate to the biosphere, we need to discover the math Nature used to putphysical structure into space.Such a mission invokes the use of geometry because, by definition, this branchof mathematics is specifically concerned with the properties, measurement, andrelationships of structure in space. Geometry is so fundamental to theorganization of the Universe that long before Galileo’s realization, Platoconcluded, “Geometry existed before creation.”Until 1975, the general public was only familiar with the principles ofEuclidean geometry, summarized in the 13-volume ancient Greek text, The Elementsof Euclid, written around 300 B.C.E. This is the geometry most of us learned inschool to plot structures such as cubes and spheres and cones onto graph paper.Euclidian geometry has enabled us to project the movement of heavenly bodies,construct great edifices and gardens, and even build spaceships andsophisticated weapons.However, the mathematical formulae of Euclidian geometry are not readilyapplicable to Nature. For example, what kind of tree can you create using thestandardized perfect forms of Euclidean geometry? Think back to the tree youdrew in kindergarten, a circle sitting atop an elongated rectangle. Yourkindergarten teacher, no doubt, recognized it as a representation of a tree, butin no way does it describe what a tree really is, no more than a stick figuredescribes a human.With Euclidean geometry and a compass, you can draw a perfect circle. But youcannot use Euclidean geometry to draw a perfect or, at least, a realistic tree.Nor can Euclidian geometry describe the structure of a beetle, a mountain, acloud, or any other familiar patterns found in Nature. Euclidean geometry fallsshort when it comes to describing the structure of life. So where do we find thetype of mathematics referred to by Plato and Galileo, the math that describesthe design principles inherent in Nature?We were offered a clue about 90 years ago when a young French mathematiciannamed Gaston Julia published a paper on his work with iterated functions. Hiswas a relatively simple equation that used only multiplication and addition,repeated ad infinitum. To actually visualize the image encoded in hismathematical formula, Julia would have had to solve millions of iterations ofthe formula, a process that would have taken him decades. Therefore, even thoughhe conceived of a fractal in mathematical terms, Julia never actually saw one.The profound implications of Julia’s formula were only revealed when hisequation was solved with the aid of computers in 1975. Benoit Mandelbrot, aFrench-American mathematician who analyzed patterns in chaotic systems at an IBMcomputing lab, was the first person to observe what Julia could only imagine.Mandelbrot was awestruck by the strikingly beautiful organic and infinitelycomplex images generated by fractal formulae. He was the first to observe thatfractal images possessed repeated self-similar patterns, regardless of the scaleon which they were examined. The more he magnified the images, the more thestructure appeared to be the same.Inherent within the chaotic complexity of fractal images is the presence ofever-repeating patterns, nested within one another. The internationally populartoy, hand-painted Russian nesting dolls, provides a rough idea of the nature ofa fractal’s repetitive images. Each smaller version of the doll is similar to,but not necessarily an exact version of, the larger doll in which it is nested.Mandelbrot introduced the term self-similar to describe such objects that heobserved in the new math, which he called fractal geometry. Russian nesting dolls represent a fractal’s repetitive image.023 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_023_r1.jpg]Within the complexity of his fractal images, Mandelbrot observed vivid patternsthat resemble shapes common in Nature, such as insects, seashells, and trees.Historically, science had frequently documented the presence of self-similarorganizational patterns at different scales of Nature’s structure. However,until Mandelbrot introduced fractal geometry, these self-similar patterns weredeemed to be merely curious coincidences.Fractal geometry emphasizes the relationship between the patterns in a wholestructure and the patterns seen in its parts. Recall the examples of thecoastline and of the twigs, branches, and tree trunks cited earlier.Self-similar patterns are found throughout Nature and especially within thestructure of the human body. For example, in the human lung, the pattern ofbranching along the large bronchus air passages is repeated in the branchingstructure of the smaller bronchi and even smaller bronchiole passages. Arterialand venous vessels of the circulatory system as well as the body’s network ofperipheral nerves also display repetitive, self-similar branching patterns.Because fractal geometry is truly the design principle of Nature, the biosphereinherently reveals nested self-similar patterns at every level of itsorganization. Consequently, as we observe and become aware of patterns at higheror lower levels of an organization’s structure, we can use fractals in the sameway we use maps. Fractals can help us gain insight into the organization at anyother level. In the biosphere, the fractal pattern of human evolution caninherently display a self-similar pattern of evolution experienced by structuresat other levels of Nature’s organization.Ernst Haeckel, a famous embryologist and contemporary of Darwin, inadvertentlyreported the first inkling of a self-similar, fractal-like pattern in evolutionin 1868. Haeckel published a now famous sequence of microscopic images thatcompares the stages of embryonic development of a number of species with that ofthe human. He noted that all vertebrate embryos, including the human embryo,pass through a series of similar structural stages. Haeckel argued that, intransitioning through their early development, organisms actually retrace everystage of their evolutionary ancestry.Haeckel’s theory, cryptically defined as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,literally means “development is a replay of ancestry.” Unfortunately, whenpromoting his ideas, an overzealous Haeckel fudged his drawings to make theearly stages of embryos appear more alike than they actually are.Regardless of his flawed presentation, human embryos do morph through a varietyof shapes before acquiring human form. In these transitions, the human embryoassumes a sequential series of self-similar structural patterns wherein itresembles embryos from earlier stages of vertebrate evolution.The developing human embryo shape-shifts from one that resembles a fish embryoto one that resembles an amphibian embryo. It continues morphing until it takeson the appearance of a reptilian embryo and, later, that of a mammal beforefinally assuming a human shape. Evolving through the embryonic stages of itsbiospheric ancestors, human embryos offer a dynamic example of fractal-likeself-similarity.EVOLUTION DECODEDIs Nature really an expression of fractal geometry? Introducing simplemathematical equations into a fractal computer program and creating realisticlandscapes and images of biological organisms provides evidence but does notprove that Nature is truly fractal in character. The appearance of self-similarpatterns throughout the biosphere may, in fact, be merely a coincidence. Thequestion then becomes, “Is there any functional reason as to why the evolutionof the biosphere would be driven by fractal geometry?”Nature is a dynamic system, founded on iterated processes and chaos mathematics,and subject to sensitivity. The fact that fractal geometry is the specificmathematics to model such a chaotic system supports, that Natuare should befractal, but it does not necessarily provide a reason as to why. However, thereis another compelling reason, based strictly on mathematics, that suggests whythe observed parallels between fractal geometry and the structure of Nature aremore than coincidence.Historically, Lamarck described evolution as transformation, a linear processthat starts with primitive organisms and progresses upward toward what hedescribed as “perfection.” In his model, Lamarck envisioned evolution as anascending ladder. Darwinists also acknowledged an upward progression inevolution, but they compared the process to a tree. They recognized that mostrandom variations that generated new organisms are similar to a tree’s lateralbranches in that they do not necessarily contribute to vertical ascension of thespecies.As a more current consideration, we would like to suggest that the path ofevolution most closely resembles the shape of an exploding chrysanthemum.Species evolve in every direction with the innate drive to inhabit all availableenvironmental niches. Organisms have evolved to live in glacier ice, at volcanicvents under the ocean, in bedrock many kilometers beneath the ground, andeverywhere in between.In the chrysanthemum model, it makes no sense to ask, “Where is evolutiongoing?” It’s going in every direction at once. To track the course of evolution,we must first define a parameter to be used as a yardstick to measureevolutionary advances. For example, the path of evolution of life in the sea hasa different meaning than the path of evolution of life on the land or in theair. Humans do not rank very high in the evolution of water-breathing organismsor in the evolutionary hierarchy of egg-laying animals or flying animals. Sowhat do humans excel at, evolutionarily speaking?As both observers of and participants in evolution, we have selected a petal ofthe evolution-chrysanthemum to represent a trait we feel distinguishes us fromlower organisms, and that trait is awareness. This is the same characteristicthat Lamarck used when he emphasized the development of the nervous system ashis evolutionary yardstick. Darwinists, likewise, illustrate their tree ofevolution in a hierarchical ascendance of nervous system development.Unfortunately, as summarized in Chapter 1, Believing Is Seeing, and in moredetail in The Biology of Belief, conventional science’s understanding ofevolution has been significantly distorted by its faulty misperception that thecell’s nucleus and its enclosed genes represent the cell’s nervous system.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en215] Hence, science currently has a myopicpreoccupation with measuring an organism’s genome as representative of itsevolutionary advancement.As described earlier, the true brain of the cell is its membrane. Built into themembrane’s structure are receptor proteins and effector proteins that serve asswitches and which represent a measurable unit of perception. Consequently, anorganism’s awareness can be physically quantified by calculating the number ofperception proteins it possesses.In Chapter 12, Time to See a Good Shrink, we provide evidence that, because ofphysical restrictions, perception proteins can only form a monolayer in themembrane. This physical restriction means that an increase in the population ofperception proteins is directly tied to an increase in the organism’s membranesurface area. In other words, for an organism’s awareness to multiply and toincrease its brain power, it would have to increase its membrane power.Simply, these insights reveal that mathematicians can calculate evolutionaryadvancement by mapping an organism’s membrane surface area.5[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en216] And how would that be done? Accordingto William Allman, author of the “Mathematics of Human Life,” an article in U.S.News & World Report, “Mathematical studies of fractals reveal that therepetitive branching-within-branching structure of a fractal represents the bestway to get the most surface area within a three-dimensional space . . .”6[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en217] Modeling evolution demands the use offractal geometry because evolution wouldn’t occur without it. Consequently theappearance of self-similar patterns in Nature is not a coincidenc; it is areflection of evolutionary mathematics.The strikingly beautiful, computer-generated pictures of fractal patterns, suchas those adorning the butterfly’s wings on the cover of this book, should remindus that, despite our modern angst and the seeming chaos of our world, there isorder in Nature. And because this order is inherently comprised of self-similarfractal patterns, there is nothing truly new under the sun.The esoteric world of fractal geometry provides a mathematical model thatsuggests the arbitrariness, planlessness, randomness, and accidents thatunderlie Darwinian theory are outmoded. We believe that continued support ofthese outdated ideas represents a fundamental threat to the survival of humanityand should, as rapidly as possible, go the way of the pre-Copernican,Earth-centered Universe.PURPOSEFUL PUNCTUATIONThe fact that the biosphere is fractal in nature is no longer a question. Themore important question before us now is, “Did biological organisms acquiretheir fractal character by accident or intention?” Conventional Darwinian theorysuggests that evolution is driven by random mutations and Nature has taken onits current structure and organization simply by accident. However, the recentdiscovery of somatic hypermutation mechanisms reveals a process by which cellspurposefully mutate their genes to actively engage in evolution.Studies by Cairns and others on bacterial evolution, presented earlier,demonstrate that living systems have an inherent ability to induce evolutionarychange to support their survival in a dynamically changing environment. Thisnewly discovered gene-altering mechanism is variously referred to as adaptive,directed, or beneficial mutations. Regardless of the term, the meaning is thesame: evolutionary changes appear to be purposeful, not random.There is an inherent underlying plan to evolution in the form of Nature’sfractal environment. Evolution is marked by periodic mass extinctions that wereapparently caused by environmental upheavals, also known as punctuations, thatdisturbed periods of evolutionary stasis. Following these environmentalalterations, life managed to survive, evolve, and, once again, flourish becauseof adaptive mutation mechanisms. The ability to intentionally mutate genesenabled surviving organisms to actively change their genetics so that they couldsurvive by complementing and harmonizing with new environmental patterns.The previous five mass extinctions were evolutionary punctuations that radicallyaltered life on this planet. Just as suddenly as old life forms disappeared dueto these catastrophic events, amazing varieties of new life forms came intoexistence.This insight on the nature of punctuated equilibrium challenges anotherfundamental assumption of Darwinian theory: the belief that evolution from onespecies to another occurs through a series of infinitely gradual transformationsover eons of time.As mentioned earlier, paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge haveverified that evolution results from long periods of stability that areperiodically interrupted by catastrophic upheavals. In their evolution theory,called Punctuated Equilibrium, Gould and Eldredge claim that each catastrophe isfollowed by an explosive increase in the number of new species at a rate fasterthan can be accounted for by plodding Darwinian mechanisms. In other words,evolution occurs by sudden leaps, not gradual transitions.7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en218]The insights of Gould and Eldredge are absolutely pertinent to the currentmoment in our evolution, especially because scientists have now established thatwe are deep into the planet’s sixth mass extinction.8[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en219] Uh oh.Will we make it? We are betting on the fact that when evolution theory isupdated and the public becomes aware of the amazing insights offered bypunctuated equilibrium, adaptive mutations, and epigenetics, civilization’sevolutionary punctuation will turn out to be a highly positive and lifeproclaiming exclamation point!If bacteria can evolve purposefully, then why not us? Can we evolve withintention? The answer is yes! And that is what this book is all about.FROM HUMAN TO HUMANITYBefore we look forward to see where fractal evolution might be taking us next,let’s go back in time and take a deeper look at the history of evolution interms of punctuated equilibrium. By assessing evolution as a series of repeatingperiods of stasis punctuated by upheavals and followed by evolutionary leaps, wecan identify four fundamental punctuations that drastically changed the courseof evolution. The recognition of these fractal punctuation patterns offerimportant insight into resolving the crises precipitated by our currentpunctuation. This figure traces the major evolutionary leaps that led to human beings. A:Individual, free-living prokaryotes. B: Community of prokaryotes within abiofilm. C: Single eukaryoteevolved from a biofilm-like life source. D:Primitive colonial organisms, a simple community of eukaryotes. E:Differentiated multicellular community of eukaryotes.024 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_024_r1.gif]Prokaryote Period: The first leap occurred within the first half billion yearsof Earth’s fiery origin. This was when the first primitive cellular citizensevolved and began to colonize the planet’s oceans. Called prokaryotes, theseprimal bacterial cells are generally the smallest and simplest cells, consistingof what could be called a bag of membrane filled with a soupy cytoplasm. Mostprokaryotes are physically supported and protected by a somewhat rigidsugar-based capsule that envelops their fragile cytoplasmic bodies. Externalcapsules physically constrain the size of prokaryotic cells and limit theirability to expand their membrane surface area.Seemingly, the prokaryote’s inability to acquire more membrane surface area and,consequently, more awareness-providing membrane perception proteins would signalthe end of evolution. However, Nature had a bigger plan up its evolutionarysleeve. In response to increasing environmental pressures generated by explodingpopulations of cells, the biological imperative, the innate will to survive,served as a driving force to further prokaryote evolution.At a moment in time, in what would amount to a spontaneous evolution, individualprokaryotes upgraded the mechanism of evolutionary advancement. Rather thantrying to further increase the size and intelligence of the individual cell,prokaryotes assembled into communities to collectively share both an enlargedsurface area and awareness. As communities, prokaryotes effectively became agroup of species occupying the same environment.While we generally perceive bacteria to be free-living cells, it is nowrecognized that unicellular prokaryotes live in functionally integrated buthighly dispersed communities wherein free-living cells enhance their awarenessby long distance exchange of chemical information.Over time, different species of bacteria acquired the ability to physically bandtogether and create life-sustaining, controllable microenvironments byenveloping the entire community within a single protective membrane. This wasNature’s equivalent of a gated community wherein the environment was maintainedby the prokaryote population. The inhabitants of these membrane-encapsulatedcommunities were a functionally complex and cooperative society of differentbacterial species. Prokaryote citizens in the community enhanced their survivalby collectively sharing their specialized functions and their DNA.Within their encapsulated communities, called biofilms, bacteria were protectedfrom antibiotics and other toxic elements in the external environment, theagents that would kill their free-living relatives who didn’t have the goodfortune to find residence in a biofilm.9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en220] The resistive and protective natureof the biofilms enabled these cellular communities to become the first lifeforms to leave the ocean and live on the land.As a footnote, we want to point out that the bacteria that form tooth cavitiesare actually biofilm communities that resist our efforts to scour them from ourteeth.Eukaryote Period: The second punctuation that precipitated an evolutionary leapoccurred when, over time, prokaryote biofilm communities evolved into a moreadvanced life form called eukaryotes. To do this, the former biofilm microbestransformed into cellular organelles, such as mitochondria and nuclei, thatcharacteristically populate the cytoplasm in the large eukaryotic cells. Manybiologists believe this organizational advance from a biofilm community to aeukaryotic community is one of the most significant events in evolutionaryhistory; that’s because Nature changed the strategy of evolution. Previously,evolution was mediated by influencing the amount of awareness in a single cell.The new strategy was based on collectively combining the awareness of acommunity into one new organism.In her book Symbiosis in Cell Evolution, American biologist Lynn Margulisexpanded on the notion that larger, more advanced eukaryotes initially derivedfrom colonies of microbes.10 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en221] Marguliscontended that symbiosis, which is the assembly of individuals based on mutuallybeneficial relationships, is a major driving force behind evolution.She suggests that Darwin’s notion of evolution, driven by the survival of thefittest in a continual competition among individuals and species, misses themark. In her opinion, cooperation, interaction, and mutual dependence among lifeforms allowed for the global expression of life. According to Margulis, “Lifedid not take over the globe by combat, but by networking.”11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en222]Stop for a moment and consider what a magnificent and paradigm-shatteringadvancement the evolution of eukaryotes was, and consider the awesomepossibilities that a similar quantum shift, based on human cooperation andsymbiosis, holds for our world today.The evolution of eukaryotes diverged into two major paths: mobile animalprotozoa, such as the amoeba and paramecium, and plant cells, represented bysingle-celled algae.The animal versions evolved an internal flexible cytoskeleton for physicalsupport and mobility. Unlike the more primitive prokaryotes whose size islimited by a constraining capsule, eukaryotes, equipped with an internalmechanical structure, were able to grow and expand their membrane in a mannersimilar to an inflated balloon. With internal cytoskeletal support, largeeukaryotic cells have thousands of times more membrane surface area and a fargreater awareness potential than individual prokaryotic cells.However, even eukaryote size is ultimately limited because of an inherentfragility in the enveloping cell membrane. If a eukaryote grows too large, thepressure generated by the mass of its internal cytoplasmic content causes itsfragile membrane to rupture, which leads to the cell’s death. Ultimately, theeukaryote, like its primitive prokaryote ancestor, reached a size limitation andwas unable to further expand its membrane-based awareness without jeopardizingits survival. The limits on expanding membrane surface area created a situationthat represented another potential evolutionary endpoint.Multicellular Period: For almost three and a half billion years, the onlyorganisms on this planet were free-living prokaryotes and the more advancedeukaryotic cells. The third evolutionary leap occurred about 700 million yearsago when individual eukaryotic cells, like their prokaryote precursors, began toshare awareness by physically assembling into communities.The first multicellular communities were simply colonial organisms, groups ofidentical cells hanging out together en masse to, we might say, “save on rent.”But, because each cell represents a unit of awareness, the more cells in acommunity, the more potential awareness that community possessed.However, as the population density of these eukaryotic communities increased,there came a time when it was no longer efficient for all the cells to do thesame thing. The workload was subdivided, and eukaryotic cells in the communitybegan to express specialized functions, such as muscle, bone, and brain.Over time, the collective awareness within eukaryotic communities led to theevolution of highly structured and altruistic multicellular organisms capable ofsupporting the survival of communities consisting of trillions of cells.Variations in the traits and functions expressed by these cellular communitiesled to the creation of cellular organizations with different structures, so thateach multicellular organism had its own distinctive anatomy. Scientists usethese anatomical characteristics to classify each version of multicellularcommunity as a unique species. When we observe trees, jellyfish, dogs, cats, andhumans, although we normally perceive of them as individual entities, in truth,they are complex multicellular communities.Societal Period: The current emergent version of evolution is characterized by astill higher order of communal assembly. This time, individual members ofcertain species—each of which is a multicellular community of eukaryotic cells,which, in turn, are each communities of prokaryotic cells—began to band togetherinto social organizations to enhance their survivability. Fish assemble intoschools, dogs into packs, bison into herds, geese into flocks, and humans intotribes, nations, and states. Social evolution provides for communities ofspecies that take on a life of their own as super-organisms.While, from our perspective, we tend to think of evolutionary leaps as producingnew species, what we’re really seeing is an evolution of increasing levels ofcommunal complexity and interrelationships. This pattern suggests that the nextphase of human evolution will not so much be about changes within individualhuman beings but about how human beings assemble into community.Humans evolved millions of years ago. What lies before us now is the evolutionof the next higher level, the community humans—humanity.Apparently, the path of evolution is not a continuous ramp of gradual progress.Rather, its history is marked by long periods of nominal advancement, followedby quantum leaps wherein nested patterns of communal assembly provide for theemergence of properties or traits that could not have been anticipated before.We see this in prokaryotes, the fundamental life forms that gave rise toindividualized, membrane-bound communities called eukaryotes. Then, thecommunities of communal eukaryotes provided for multicellular species, such asplants and animals. Then, plants and animals subsequently assembled into higherorder communities that we define as societal organizations.If we were to illustrate this new perspective, we would see four tiers ofgradual progression, with each tier distinguished from its evolutionary neighborby a quantum jump:a. Prokaryotes => Eukaryotes (evolution of single-cell communities)b. Eukaryotes => Multicellular organisms (evolution of plants, animals, andhumans)c. Multicellular organisms => Societal organizations (evolution of humanity) Evolution is not a steady slope but periods of stasis or gradual progressionfollowed by quantum jumps.025 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_025_r1.gif]We believe that human civilization, as a society, is struggling with its veryexistence. The pattern of evolution, as illustrated here, shows that we are onthe threshold of experiencing the next evolution, the true expression ofhumanity.NO NEW STORIES: OUR FUTURE THROUGH A FRACTAL LOOKING GLASSBased on Nature’s fractal character, the pattern of structures within any onetier of organization is self-similar to the pattern expressed by structures athigher or lower tiers of organization.Consequently, the structures, functions, and behaviors of a prokaryotic cell inTier 1, a eukaryotic cell in Tier 2, a human in Tier 3, and society in Tier 4express self-similar patterns in their evolution and organization.The inherent nature of fractal self-similarity is the key reason why knowledgegained from studying the biology of cells can be applied to understanding humanbiology as well as communal society. More importantly, fractal evolution impliesthat an awareness of the organization and dynamics employed by cells in thecommunity that comprises the human body can provide insight into the patternsrequired to create a similar harmony among the human cells who collectivelycontribute to human society.Through millions of years of evolution, cellular citizens within multicellularorganisms have worked out an effective peace plan that enables them to enhancetheir survival as well as the survival of other organisms in the biosphere.Consider the remarkable harmony among the trillions of individual cells livingwithin the skin of a healthy human body. Our cells have apparently resolved anyissues that would hinder cooperation so that our tissues and organs, which arethe cellular community’s equivalent of nation states, tend to support ratherthan compete and fight with each other. For example, nowhere in medicalliterature is there documentation of the liver invading the pancreas in order tocapture the Islets of Langerhans!In coherence with fractal self-similarity, the assembly of humans intomulticellular humanity expresses a similar pattern formerly used by cells tocreate a multicellular human body. The path of human evolution parallels theearlier path of animal evolution in which the animal kingdom progressed throughtwo distinct phases: the primitive invertebrate phase followed by themore-advanced vertebrate phase.As we shall see, the fundamental difference between invertebrates andvertebrates is the mechanism by which they support themselves. Likewise, thefundamental difference between early humans and advanced humans is also thelatter’s ability to support themselves and their societies.Invertebrates: Multicellular invertebrate organisms, such as shellfish andinsects, resemble prokaryotes in that they lack an internal skeleton and rely onexternal exoskeletal support, such as that provided by mineral shells or rigidchitin capsules.In regard to the character of support, the earliest human civilizations weretantamount to invertebrates in that they relied on external support from MotherNature. If She provided, they survived.Vertebrates: In regard to support, vertebrate organisms, like their constituenteukaryotic cells, are physically supported from within by a rigid backbone.The evolution of the vertebrate phase of human civilization correlates with theorigin of technologies that enabled humans to support themselves through theprowess of their internal intelligence mechanisms. When civilization evolved toits internally supported vertebrate level, humans no longer relied on handoutsfrom Nature—or so it seemed.Similarly, vertebrate animals evolved through an increasingly more complexsequence that led from fish to amphibians, to reptiles, to birds, and to mammalsprior to the origin of humans. Consequently, we can assume that, in a fractalUniverse, the human community will likely evolve through a sequence ofself-similar developmental stages that express the character of fish,amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.Fish: The fundamental character of fish is their dependence on a waterenvironment.Likewise, the earliest stages of self-sustaining human communities werefish-like in that they were physically restricted to the immediate vicinity ofwater. These mariculture societies flourished by harvesting food from oceans andwater from lakes and nearby wetlands. Their highways were waterways, and theyspread their civilizations by paddling or sailing from one coast to another.Amphibians: While amphibians are birthed in the water, they are able to ventureonto the land by acquiring mechanisms to take water with them.Similarly, human civilization entered the amphibian phase and moved inland whenpeople developed methods to convey water from lakes and waterways or extract itfrom subterranean aquifers. Through the rise of agriculture, these civilizationscreated and employed technology that enabled them to sustain and thrive in theirnew land-based environment.Reptiles: From amphibians, which are relatively sluggish and vulnerable on land,came reptiles, which traded in the aquatic skills of their amphibian ancestorsin favor of a superiorly designed, land-based physiology. Through adaptation,reptiles honed hardened bodies of great strength, speed, and dexterity suitablefor their purely terrestrial environment. The digital character of a lizard’sdarting eyes and tongue and its mechanized gait attest to this machine-likenature.The evolution of human civilization followed a self-similar path when theIndustrial Revolution provoked humanity’s transition from its earlier agrarianphase, which is comparable to the amphibian environment, to a moresophisticated, mechanized Industrial Age, which is reptilian in nature.Dinosaurs: A unique branch of highly successful reptiles eventually evolved whenNature enlarged the blueprint of a 5-inch lizard to make a 50-foot dinosaur.While the lizard is a relatively small organism, a dinosaur was a giant killingmachine. Interestingly, dinosaur is a Greek word that means “terrifyingmonstrous lizard.”But, while the dinosaur’s body grew to massive size, its brain didn’t. Considerthat, if a 5-inch lizard requires ten muscle cells to move its leg in a certainway, the massive 50-foot dinosaur might necessitate 10,000 muscle cells to makethe same movement. However, the brain of each creature requires only one nerveto activate that movement.The point is this: as dinosaurs’ bodies became enlarged, their brains remainedquite small. The fact that lizards are still here today and dinosaurs areextinct suggests that the dinosaurs’ undersized brain, although able to supportamazing reflex behaviors, wasn’t adequate to sustain survival of their massivebodies during times of environmental upheaval.Bringing that situation forward in time, the successful nature of the IndustrialAge enabled human industry to evolve from small mom-and-pop shops into giantinternational corporations. Analogous to dinosaurs, corporations have largebodies of administrative bureaucracies commanded by decision-making executiveswith small, reptilian brains.Be forewarned: the patterns expressed in humanity’s corporate dinosaurs are areiteration of the same life-threatening flaws that led to the extinction ofanimal dinosaurs.As was the case with dinosaurs, the so-called brains of conventionalcorporations are effective when controlling the reflexive behavior and growth oftheir organizations—as long as the environment stays stable. However, giantcorporations lack the neurological ability to control and adapt their massivebodies to survive in environments that are in upheaval.One example is the U.S. auto industry in which executive brains continue to pushgas-guzzling sport utility vehicles on consumers who recognize the world isfacing a global oil crisis. An indication of their threatened extinction is thecurrent junk bond status of General Motors’ once-valuable stock.We can only imagine that the final dinosaurs might have gone on a feeding frenzywhen they witnessed others of their species running amuck and collapsing intotar pits of extinction. Similarly, we see colossal entities today engorgingthemselves at the expense of others, as was the case in October 2008 when theU.S. banking institution, a fiscal dinosaur, quickly and easily consumed $700billion of U.S. taxpayers’ money.Another interesting similarity between the corporate dinosaurs of humanity todayand real-life—er, real-extinct—dinosaurs of yore is the fact that moderncivilization is fueled by oil, which is often referred to as the blood of thedinosaurs. As industrial organizations drink the last of the dinosaurs’ blood,current dinosaurian corporations are facing their own imminent extinction and,if we’re not careful, the extinction of civilization as we know it.Fortunately, we can also find hope within the fractal parallels of biologicalevolution.While dinosaurs were the first reptile descendents to rule the world, two otherpaths of evolution—birds and mammals—were arising in the shadows.Birds: Birds evolved as a direct spin-off from the ground-bound dinosaurs.A self-similar pattern of evolution expressed itself in human history wheninventors and entrepreneurs, still at the growing-lizard size ofindustrialization, paved the path for humanity’s bird phase. The first key eventin this evolutionary path was the flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright over thesands at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903.Mammals: At the same time that birds evolved from the dinosaur lineage, a newspecies also branched from small reptiles. These novel furry species, calledmammals, represented the origins of a new class of neurologically sophisticatedorganisms. In reference to the way they raise their young, mammals arecharacterized as nurturers who encourage growth, development, and thriving.Until 65 million years ago, small reptiles and meek mammals were at the mercy ofthe ruthless monstrous lizards. At that time, a planetary upheaval led to theextinction of the dinosaurs and, for a short time, birds ruled the world.However, in the absence of those mammoth killing machines, the moresophisticated mammals seized the opportunity to evolve and become masters of thebiosphere.EARTH—FROM THE BIRD’S-EYE VIEWJust as with the emergence of bird species, the advent of aviation radicallyaltered the development of human civilization.Prior to aviation, Earth’s massive size, with its terrestrial and maritimebarriers, seemed to be a formidable obstacle that made integration of theworld’s population unimaginable. However, within a decade of the WrightBrother’s flight, and, by the end of World War I in 1918, aircraft were capableof flying high over mountains, deserts, and oceans. Technological advancementscontinued, and, with today’s jets, physical distance between continents andnations is no longer a relevant factor whether engaging in business or personaltravel, whether waging war or peace.Humanity’s bird phase reached its peak in the late 1960s when aviationtechnology provided civilization with a new, bird’s-eye perspective of MotherEarth.In October 1968, the crew of the Apollo 7 space mission beamed back the firstpictures of our planet, one of which appeared on the cover of TIME magazine inJanuary 1969. Another, titled “Earthrise—Apollo 8,” taken in December 1969, is adramatic image of Earth rising over the lunar surface.But humanity’s ingenuity toward flight reached an even higher summit in July1969 when Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, and Michael Collins landed theirApollo 11 spacecraft on the moon. When Armstrong, clad in a bulky space suit,alit on the lunar surface and uttered, “One small step for man; one giant leapfor mankind,” he was making a statement both profound and prophetic in thecourse of human evolution.These events marked the first time that every citizen in the world couldactually experience the finite nature of our beautiful planet and its isolationin space.When birds, aviators, and astronauts fly above the surface of Earth, they gain agreater perspective of the planet than their water-based and land-basedpredecessors. When astronauts transmit their view of Earth as a blue-green gemsuspended in the black emptiness of space back to people on the planet, theyshare that new perspective with the rest of humanity as well.And those images, from that perspective, have had such a powerful effect oncivilization that they have caused a change in the course of human evolution.Those images fostered and concretized the hippie notion, professed byvisionaries such as Buckminster Fuller, that we are all one people travelingthrough the galaxy on tiny, fragile Spaceship Earth.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en223]Those images of our Nest in the Stars induced a quality of self-consciousness inhumanity that kindled and ignited an innate mammalian desire in responsivepeople to support survival by taking care of the environment; keeping our foodand bodies healthy; and raising our children, families, and communities in anatmosphere of love and harmony.Inspired by those initial photos from space, visionary John McConnell createdthe Earth Flag in 1969. In 1970, the United States celebrated the inauguralEarth Day and initiated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. And the 1970ssaw the enactment of five major pieces of legislation to protect the nation’sair, water, and land.Simply stated, in response to the perspective provided by astronauts, anever-increasing number of former reptilian-phase humans experienced an emergentleap in evolution wherein they became aware that survival is contingent onnurturing the planet and all species as well as our individual selves. Theseawakened persons become the seeds of our next evolutionary leap, the emergenceof humanity’s mammalian phase.In that regard, the current state of civilization resembles the fractaliteration of a self-similar pattern that occurred millions of years ago inanimal evolution, a time when dinosaurs, birds, and primitive furry mammalsshared an uneasy coexistence. Such a vision invokes an image of movie directorSteven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park in which humans run for their lives asmonstrous dinosaurs, the equivalent of all-consuming corporations, such as“Enron-osaurus Wrecks” run amuck and threaten the survival of the meek. At somepoint in Earth’s prehistoric history, an undetermined event led to theextinction of the ruling dinosaurs and opened an opportunity for mammals, themeek, to inherit the earth.Likewise, the current ecological, economic, and population crises that facehumanity are portents of the demise of dinosaur-like corporations and the riseof green-friendly human nurturers.As we project our fractal pattern into the future, we see it is likely thatcurrent global stresses will precipitate the planet’s next evolutionary leap asmarked by the emergence of civilization’s nurturing mammals as the dominant lifeforce on the planet.FRACTALS UNDER OUR SKINWhile fractal self-similarity within the vertebrate evolutionary pattern mayoffer insight into our own evolutionary human destiny, this particular patterndoes not provide adequate information regarding how we should navigate ourcourse in order to secure survival.For that pattern, we must examine the fractal image from a differentperspective: rather than charting the dynamic unfolding of the image, we mustfocus on the structural patterns inherent within the fractal image itself.Beneath our skin is a community of cells that is 700 times larger than thepopulation of the entire Earth. If humans were to model the lifestyle displayedby a healthy community of human cells, perhaps our societies and our planetwould not have to contend with the impending sixth mass extinction.Consequently, our next step is to explore the Universe beneath our skin throughthe lens of fractal geometry. This eye-opening journey will reveal strikingparallels between human and cellular society, and it will offer informativeinsights for living a healthy, happy life in a coherent world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12TIME TO SEE A GOOD SHRINK“You know, our cells just might be smarter than we are.”— Swami Beyondananda Fractal geometry provides for infinitely complex structures assembled fromsimple repeating self-similar patterns. The deeper you look into a fractalimage, the more detail you discover. A cell and a human body are self-similarfractal images that share self-similar functions and needs in their quest tosurvive. Therefore, the life of a cell in the body and the life of a human incivilization are parallel realities, fundamentally self-similar.Because cells and humans find themselves in similar biological circumstances, itnaturally raises the question, “How can 50 trillion cells live in harmony andpeace while a mere 7 billion people are on the verge of annihilating eachother?” The answer to that question can be found by studying the fractalstructure of Nature.From the fractal viewpoint, it stands to reason that the organizing principlesresponsible for the evolution of multicellular communities would befundamentally self-similar to the principles that govern humanity’s survival.Consequently, it behooves us to shrink ourselves down to the size of a cell andenter the body on a fact-finding mission to see how cellular communities havebecome so successful. What works for the cell, works for the human, and whatworks for the human, will work for humanity.Reverse engineering is the process used to reproduce another manufacturer’sproduct by carefully examining the details of its construction or composition.By reverse engineering the dynamics and principles used by 50 trillion cellularcitizens to successfully create the human body, we can learn valuable insightsthat can be directly applied in our quest to sustain human civilization.CELL034 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_034_r1.gif]-USThroughout our journey, we have emphasized that the human body is not merely asingle entity, but a conglomeration of trillions of cells. Cells are theindividual units of life, and our body is the cell’s expression of community.Because we are made of cells, our body’s life requires that we also care for ourcells’ survival.Therefore, simple logic says that our body and our cells have the same needs:oxygen, water, nutrients, a controlled environment to insulate life processesfrom the extremes of surrounding elements, and protection from other life forms,such as viruses, that would deplete energy and resources. Likewise, humans andcells have to work, that is, expend energy, in order to survive. People go towork to provide for their families, and cells work together for the health ofthe body.Why? What is it that drives all life forms, from the first bacterium to humanbeings, to perpetuate this cycle of life? That mysterious force is thebiological imperative, the inborn mechanism that unconsciously motivatesorganisms, regardless of their size, to survive.A species’ ability to fulfill its innate drive to survive is predicated on thefollowing basic factors: energy, growth, protection, resources, efficiency, andawareness.If we were to create a Survival Index formula to assess the survivability of anorganism, the equation would look like this:026 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_026_r1.gif]Total Energy: Total energy represents the total amount of energy available todrive the organism’s life’s processes. Energy generates the body’s behaviors andmovements. In fact, a body without energy is called a cadaver.Growth Mechanisms: Growth expenses represent the energy expenditures used byphysiologic systems to secure energy, maintain the body’s health and well-being,and help it grow. These growth mechanisms collectively contribute to theorganism’s ability to find, ingest, and digest food; absorb nutrients; andeliminate waste. Growth occurs when the organism uses energy to convertnutrients into complex molecules needed to rebuild or replace worn-out cells.Protection Mechanisms: Protection mechanisms are indispensable to survival. Inthe human body, these mechanisms include the adrenal system’s fight-or-flightreaction to external threats and the immune system’s response to internalpathogens.Environmental threats force an organism to withdraw a substantial quantity ofenergy from its energy reserves and reallocate that energy toward the protectionof its very life. The more fear or stress an organism perceives, the more energyit diverts for protection. Because growth and protection behaviors are funded bythe organism’s energy reserves, the cost of protection curtails or inhibitsgrowth.That is why, in our Survival Index, growth and protection processes subtractenergy from an organism’s system. Simply put, an organism’s survival iscompromised by the amount of energy it must expend to protect itself, which iswhy an organism can be literally scared to death!Resources: Organisms derive energy from environmental resources. In fact,survival is predicated on an organism’s ability to secure external energy ofequal or greater value than the amount of internal energy spent to acquire andprocess those resources.The act of acquiring and processing resources from external sources is calledwork.The primary resources for biological organisms are air, water, and nutrients,which come from both chemical energy and nonmaterial energy from environmentalfields.Until the evolution of human beings, organisms relied on renewable resources forsurvival. Under this arrangement, the environment’s resources were continuouslyreplenished and Earth’s many species were sustained over eons of time. Even whenan individual organism died, the recycling of its physical remains contributedto the energy available for other individuals.Humans, however, altered the biosphere’s balance and harmony by evolving into atechnology-based civilization in which survival is dependent on extraction ofthe planet’s nonrenewable resources. The current oil crisis is only one of manyexamples of how our acquired dependence on nonrenewable resources threatens ourexistence. This situation, in which society’s survival is linked toever-diminishing external environmental resources, has sapped our internalenergy and compromised humanity’s future. Logically—not a smart move.Efficiency: Efficiency, which is the measure of work accomplished compared tothe amount of energy put into that work, is essential to survival. Theefficiency by which an organism utilizes its energy resources is a primaryfactor in determining its survivability.Through evolutionary advances in structure and functionality, organisms honedtheir operational efficiency over time. And, by using energy more efficiently,they were able to invest their conserved energy into further evolutionarydevelopment.Awareness: Awareness represents an organism’s ability to perceive, interpret,and respond to environmental information. As the basis of intelligence,awareness ranges from simple reflex responses to conscious action, and then tothe more advanced intelligence offered by self-consciousness.The fundamental cellular units of awareness are the membrane’s receptor proteinsand effector proteins that serve as perception switches, as described earlier.Because perception proteins can only form a monolayer in the membrane,increasing the level of an organism’s awareness is the direct result ofincreasing its membrane surface area.Specifically, an organism’s collective awareness correlates to the amount ofmembrane surface area that the organism dedicates to processing environmentalperceptions.027 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_027_r1.gif]In light of current global crises, it is apparent that human survival skills arequestionable, at best. As mentioned earlier, energy is required to sustain life,and the loss of energy manifests in weakness, illness, and death. In contrast tohuman beings, all other organisms are proven models of energy conservation andefficiency. We know this because organisms that failed to properly manage theirlife energy reserves are extinct.Humans, who are vastly more wasteful than any other organism in the environment,are facing the same eventuality. Unfortunately, humanity’s destruction of thebiosphere could also lead to the mass extinction of even those more intelligentand more efficient organisms that have lived in harmony with the environment formillions of years.The Survival Index reminds us that we are asleep, inefficient, and expending toomuch energy on wanton, unwarranted growth and protection. Consider theexorbitant expense of security, whether of the in-home or homeland variety.A consideration of the factors that contribute to the Survival Index emphasizesthat, in order to survive, we must reduce our protection expenditures, switch torenewable resources, become considerably more efficient, and wake up.Government and financial leaders, trying to mend the current global economicsystem by applying bandages here and loans there and a big dollop of bailout toboot, are behaving like stewards on the Titanic, arranging the deck chairs asthe ship is going down.Perhaps, as Einstein suggested, it is time to resolve our problems through newthinking. Perhaps, in pursuit of vital knowledge, we must learn from ancientsages who advised, “The answers we seek lie within.” Einstein echoed that wisdomwhen he wrote, “Look deep, deep into nature, and then you will understandeverything better.”1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en224]So, as we descend into the inner workings of biology, we will focus on thefactors listed in the Survival Index. We expect to find that an awareness ofsocial and economic patterns expressed by successful eukaryotic cells andmulticellular organisms, such as our own human bodies, can help us create atemplate to promote a healthier, more-successful version of humanity.ENORMOUS INSIGHTS FROM THE LITTLE PEOPLECommunal life increases survivability by encouraging greater operatingefficiency and awareness. For example, if a single cell possesses an awarenesspotential of x, then a colony of 30 cells would have a collective awarenesspotential of at least 30x. That means that the collective information within acommunity offers each resident cell an awareness potential many times greaterthan that possessed by their independent, free-living, unicellular cousins.It was the drive to increase awareness that provoked individual primitiveprokaryotes to assemble into the first communities, the social organizationscalled biofilms. Biofilms later evolved into individual eukaryotic cells, suchas an amoeba or algal cell, which represent evolved versions of prokaryoticcommunities encapsulated within a cell membrane.Around 700 million years ago, Nature reiterated an old strategy to increaseawareness: assemble single cells, eukaryotes, into multicellular communities toshare awareness and efforts for the mutual benefit of all. In these close-kniteukaryotic cell colonies, individual cells essentially performed the same jobsand pooled their productivity.As colonies exceeded certain population limits, it was no longer efficient forall cells to do the same work. Communal cells began to partition workload amongthemselves, delegating specific tasks to different cells, a process calleddifferentiation.These very same developmental patterns were played out in early humancivilization when families lived and traveled together as a clan. In thesesmall, undifferentiated colonial groups, all members participated in the samelife-preserving chores, primarily procuring food.As clans grew into larger tribes, it was no longer efficient for all members toperform the same job. Therefore, individuals took on specific, differentiatedcommunal responsibilities: some hunted, some gathered, and some protected theyoung and elderly. And as the size of tribes grew, the workload was furthersubdivided among the population, which resulted in a hierarchy of specializedworkers.Differentiated cells in a cellular community are akin to craftsmen. In the sameway that human craftsmen organized into guilds, differentiated cells formtissues and organs whose products and services are required for the community’ssurvival. For example, a differentiated cardiac muscle cell is a master ofcontraction, and organized guilds of cardiac cells comprise the heart. Inexchange for their specialized cardiovascular services, cardiac cells receivecomplementary services from other guilds of highly skilled cells: nutrients fromthe digestive system, oxygen from the respiratory system, protection from theimmune system, waste management through the excretory system, and world newsthrough the nervous system.The first heart, the first liver, and the first kidney represented the firstbusinesses on Earth. The heart is the energy industry and its constituentcardiac cells are employees. Likewise, the immune system is the equivalent ofthe Environmental Protection Agency, and the white blood cells are its agents.The kidney is a waste management organization with an amazing recycling program.And here’s the important lesson we can learn from these early enterprises: Thesuccess of these systems, as businesses, is not based on competitiveness withother organs and tissues. Rather, success is measured by how well each organfulfills its job of cooperating with other systems.The number of undifferentiated eukaryotic cells in primitive colonial organismsranged from fewer than 30 to several hundred. From these humble roots, communityplanning and management enabled eukaryotes to create phenomenally successfulmulticellular organisms with cell populations numbering in the trillions.Each individual cell in a giant multicellular civilization has the samephysiologic functions, drives, and needs as individual humans in society. Cellsare the equivalent of miniature people, each having personal lives while sharingthe experience of community—and that’s not just a metaphor.The remarkable harmony displayed at the cellular level is the one trulynoteworthy character that distinguishes successful eukaryotic cell communitiesfrom the current state of human society. Cellular societies that comprise ourbodies truly exemplify the United States motto, e pluribus unum, “out of many,one.” Each cell is an individual, yet they all behave and support one another.Unity does not mean uniformity. A liver cell does not physically or functionallyresemble a muscle cell, which, in turn, does not look like a nerve cell. Thecells, while functionally forming a whole, are subdivided by borders intocommunities that we distinguish as uniquely different tissues and organs. Eachcommunity contributes a task, talent, or mission that supports the body’ssurvival.Each nation and culture on the globe is the equivalent of a tissue or organ inthe larger super-organism referred to as humanity. In the manner that each organsystem contributes to the economy of the body, each nation contributes to theeconomy of whole of humanity.The cells that populate an organ may look different and live by different rulesthan neighboring cells just across the organ’s border. The valuable work they dohas more to do with their differences than similarities!Across the globe today, countries see each other as rivals, and many countriesare preoccupied with making other countries simply disappear altogether. If thatbehavior occurred within the body, it would be tantamount to your internalsystems taking sides with the intention of banishing a particular organ ortissue. Which of your vital organs would you choose to banish out of existence?How might that impact your ability to thrive, let alone survive?If it seems like a stretch to compare organs with nations, consider this fractalimage: Built into the cell membrane, which is the skin that surrounds eacheukaryotic cell, are protein perimeters that delineate territories. Within eachof these membrane boundaries are selected populations of proteins that engage inspecific functions. Partitioned membrane territories are the functionalequivalent of specialized nano-organs. If these protein territories were stainedusing different color dyes, their groupings in the membrane of the sphericalcell would curiously resemble the outlines of national territories on a globalmap.ARE OUR CELLS SMARTER THAN WE ARE?We can learn far greater insights regarding the nature of successful communitieswhen we focus our vision even deeper and observe the lives of cells on a moreintimate level.Consider the awesome job our cells do to bring us into the world every day. Thencompare that with the mediocre job humans do in the category of “works and playswell with others.” With that self-assessment, we might actually have to adjustour self-aggrandized intelligence downward a few notches and recognize that ourcells are smarter than we are. Observing the day-to-day operations of ourcellular citizens may come as a blow to our collective ego because just abouteverything we humans do, including the development of technology, our cells didfirst and, to this very day, still do better.For example, cells have:• A monetary system that pays cells according to the importance of the work theydo and stores excess profits in community banks.• A research and development system that creates technology and manufacturesbiochemical equivalents of steel cables, plywood, ferroconcrete, electroniccircuitry, and high-speed computer networks.• An environmental system that provides air and water purification treatmentthat is more technologically advanced than humans have ever imagined. Ditto forthe heating and cooling system.• An exceedingly complex and extremely fast communications system, like theInternet, that sends zip-coded messages directly to individual cells.• A criminal justice system that detains, imprisons, rehabilitates, and, yes, ina Kevorkian way, even assists with the suicide of destructive cells.• Full health-care coverage that makes sure each cell gets all it needs to stayhealthy.• An immune system that protects the cells and the body like a dedicatedNational Guard.TECHNOLOGY: CELLS HIT THE INDUSTRIAL AGE AGES AGOAs human technological innovations were introduced to the world, biologistsfrequently equated each new emerging technology with the mechanisms displayed bythe body’s systems. The steam engine led pioneering physiologists to comparepressure-creating pneumatics with the body’s mechanical operation. Whenphysicists first understood and harnessed electricity, biologists of that dayequated the electrical power grid with the nervous system. More recently,neuroscientists have compared supercomputers with the brain. And computerscientists are so enamored with cell’s information processing technology thatthey are currently incubating nerve cells on computer chips to meld theirtechnologies.It is important to recognize that there is a lot more to the marvels of thebody’s technology than just the cells. In the same manner that humans utilizeengineered materials to construct buildings to house themselves and theirenterprises, cells do the exact same thing. Here are a few examples.Approximately one half of the body’s mass is comprised of extracellularmatrices, known as collagen. Collagen is a thread-like protein secreted by thecells into their surrounding environment. In much the same manner that a spiderspins a web from its body to outside its body, the cells construct thisextracellular structure around themselves. The shape of every organ, bloodvessel, nerve, muscle, and bone is maintained by this supporting matrix of wovencollagen protein fibers. In fact, if all the cells were removed from a humanbody, the extracellular collagen would maintain the body’s structure intact asthough it were a flexible, fibrous sculpture.Collagen proteins are an engineering tour de force: these organic filaments canbe woven into a fabric with the softness of silk, a trait characterized by ababy’s bottom. But changing the weave pattern creates collagen textiles with thebullet-resistance of Kevlar. To gain an appreciation of the body’s technologicalskill, collagen filaments spun into rope-like fiber, such as those that comprisetendons and ligaments, have vastly more strength, flexibility, and far lessweight than equal-sized filaments of steel.The collagen secreted by specialized bone-forming, body-architect cells, calledosteoblasts, is like magnificent steel girders that shape massive skyscrapers.In the assembly process, osteoblasts decorate their collagen girders withproteins that cause the spontaneous formation of crystallized calcium, thebody’s equivalent of marble. These result in light-weight, extraordinarilystrong calcified collagen grids that form bones.To gain an appreciation for the body’s ability in this endeavor, consider that acell looking at a six-foot human body sees an object as proportionally as talland magnificent as does a person gazing up at a 10,000-story marblebuilding—including the mezzanine, the thirteenth floor, and the penthouse.Chondrocytes are cells that manufacture cartilage, the body’s equivalent ofconcrete. Pouring cartilage into preformed shapes molded by collagen matrices,chondrocytes create freestanding sculptures such as the nose and earlobe.Cartilage, like concrete, is fragile. Given a good bust in the nose, it quiteliterally fractures into pieces.Fragility is an issue for the cartilage disk that the body uses as a cushionbetween individual vertebral bones in the spine. Ordinary cartilage in thatposition would be crushed to the consistency of gravel under the pressure of thebackbone’s weight-bearing movement. Therefore, eukaryote freemasons learned toreinforce their cartilage with steel-like collagen filaments, thus creatingfibrocartilage, the organic equivalent of rebar reinforced ferroconcrete. Theimportance of this weight-bearing composite material in forming theintervertebral disk is generally only appreciated after one of them happens toslip.Within the skin-enclosed body environment, inhabitant cells are the equivalentof marine organisms that live and breathe in a watery environment. Ingeniousplumbing and filtration mechanisms, which include the lymphatic and circulatoryvessel systems, continuously purify and recycle the body’s life-providing water.Cellular technologies in the liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, and spleenprovide the most advanced and efficient filtration systems on the planet. Theseorgans eliminate and detoxify waste products, replenish vital life-sustainingcomponents, and defend against invasive organisms with effectiveness far beyondthat offered by human designers.Sophisticated engineering feats, pioneered by the body and later created byhumans for surgical implant and replacement operations, include hydraulic andmechanically operated valves, osmotic pressure pumps, countercurrent-exchangesystems, mechanical leverage systems that utilize universal joints and linkages,and self-regulating feedback and feed-forward information loops.A more familiar technical innovation first created by the body’s cells is colortelevision. Human eyes are endowed with the same fundamental red-green-bluecolor system that creates full-color images on human-manufactured TV sets.In the short history of computer science, electrical engineers have introducedtransistors, capacitors, and batteries to high-speed, parallel-processinginformation networks, stereoscopic 3-D vision, and computer-generated imagery.And while these are amazing technological advancements, we must recognize thateukaryotic cells first put those systems into motion millions of years ago.Perhaps the most amazing feat of the body’s collective cellular citizens is thehuman brain, the most powerful computer system designed and created . . . ever!In an ongoing zealous endeavor to adapt human physiology to the humanenvironment, building an information processing system that can rival the powerof the human brain is the ultimate mission of every driven computer engineer.In fact, scientists in the emerging field of biomimicry are reverse engineeringbiology’s age-old technological advances in an effort to create new technologiesthat will sustain life on the planet.THE CELLULAR ECONOMY: NO CELL LEFT BEHINDThe movements of protein molecules that provide bodily functions require energyto empower their actions. We become personally aware of the body’s energyexpenditures through the heat it both generates and, conserves to keep thesystem at the proper operating temperature.Cells in the body manage their energy needs by exchanging molecules of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), an adenosine molecule with three phosphate chemical groupsattached to it. ATP is the molecular equivalent of a rechargeable battery,similar to the battery used in a mobile phone. Cells tap the energy from ATPmolecules to empower cellular functions.ATP molecules release a unit of energy when one of their three phosphates isclipped off. Discharging the energy in an ATP molecule causes it to becomeadenosine diphosphate (ADP), an adenosine molecule with only two phosphates.Through the efforts of their work, cells can recharge the ADP molecule byreattaching another phosphate and turning it back into an energized ATPmolecule. Cells work to make ATP and expend ATP to do work.ATP molecules are exchanged, like a currency, among the body’s cells.Interestingly, biology textbooks often refer to ATP as the “coin of the realm,”a reference to the fact that energy in human society is equated to money. Themore dollars one has, the more energy one has to create and support life.Insights into managing a sound economy are available if, as economists mightsay, we “follow the ATP.” In exchange for ATP salaries, cells work for thesystem and pool their productivity. Cells can bank extra energy savings bystoring ATP coins in their cytoplasm. ATP salaries are commensurate with thecell’s contribution to the body. Cells whose efforts are more vital to thecommunity get paid more ATP and may even be provided with cellular entouragesthat support their specialized functions. While cells are on different payscales, every cell is provided with the basics of life: food, shelter, healthcare, and protection.Excess energy, the equivalent of cellular profits, is stored in what might becalled regional and national banks, physically represented by reserves ofadipose, or fat cells. By their nature, energy reserves are true deposits.However, savings are not stored in individual accounts. Rather, all energyreserves are available for use by the entire community. At the behest of thebody’s government—which we will describe later in this chapter—energy reservescan be sent anywhere in the system where they are needed to build, upgrade, orrepair the body’s infrastructure. With this system of equity, cells freelycontribute their efforts to the community and never have to worry about wheretheir next ATP paycheck will come from.In regard to ATP/ADP exchange, the body is a closed system, which means there’sno external lending mechanism or procedure from which the body can borrowenergy. Because there is no Federal Reserve Bank with power to coin ATP, whenthe system needs emergency funds, that energy must come from resources thatalready exist within the community. This means that cells cannot charge debt onan Ascended MasterCard to be repaid in a future lifetime—with or withoutinterest. Therefore, true fiscal conservatives will be happy to know that thebody’s energy budget is always balanced.A HEALTHY CENTRAL VOICE: THE CELLULAR INTELLIGENCE AGENCYEvery cell that comprises the human body is an independent, intelligent,sentient being that, when given a proper environment, is self-sufficient and cansurvive on its own. However, a multicellular organism is not simply a bunch ofself-serving eukaryotic cells crowded together under one skin; functionally,they form a community.Community, by its nature, represents an organization of individuals who sharecommon interests, attitudes, or goals. The key word is share. As a member of acommunity, a cell defers its own personal interests and agrees to support thewhole. In return, the cell’s survivability is enhanced by increased awarenessand energy efficiency that comes from the cooperative community.Survival is predicated on one’s ability to accurately assess and respond toenvironmental information. Dispersed primitive prokaryotes in the first level ofthe biosphere’s evolution communicated information across distances by releasingsignals into the environment, and other prokaryotes received and responded tothese signals.Information exchange was enhanced in the next level of evolution when closelypacked eukaryotes acquired membrane junctions that enabled them to physicallyconnect, or plug in, to one another. Cell junctions are functionally analogousto computer cables used to create a network among a number of individualcomputers.Increasing the population density in multicellular organisms led to many cellsexisting in the organism’s internal regions without direct access to externalenvironmental cues. This created a need for cells on the interior to receivemessages from cells on the exterior.Therefore, through differentiation, a new breed of eukaryotic cells, the nervecells, formed in the skin where they could perceive environmental conditions andrelay that information inward. This subsequently led to development of thenervous system, which is an information network that interconnects the cells inthe community, regardless of their location, and enables two-way communicationfrom internal organs to the skin and from the skin to the organs.This flow of information between the external environment and internal cellsmakes the nervous system’s regulatory function tantamount to the body’sgovernment.The governing nervous system does not tell the other body cells how to do theirjobs. The heart cells beat and cells of the digestive system process foodbecause of their own built-in intelligence. Distributed within each organ systemare clusters of nerve cells called ganglia. Ganglia resemble state governmentsthat process local organ-related information, as distinct from the brain, whichfunctions as the central government and manages what might be called the affairsof the “Federation of Organs.”As an example, if we were to remove the entire digestive system, mouth to anus,from the body and place food into the esophagus, the local nerve ganglia wouldmove that food through the entire digestive process to the elimination of wastewithout any input from the central nervous system.In addition to coordinating the functions within an organ system, gangliaexchange information with the brain, which integrates and coordinates dataderived from the body’s other systems. As the central information processingsystem, the brain trusts that the organs and organ systems will regulate theirown functions, and it continues to operate under that protocol until it receivesan indication that a job isn’t being performed properly.The allocation of management responsibility is analogous to the original intentof the U.S. Constitution, which states that anything not specifically designatedas a power of the federal government is left to the regional authority of thestates.The nervous system not only perceives and organizes the body’s response toenvironmental stimuli; it also learns and remembers information from pastexperiences. The efficiency gained by working in community enabled the body toinvest significant energy to support an amazingly large population of nervecells specifically dedicated to processing and memorizing learned perceptions.The enhanced information-handling capacity provided by the networking of atrillion cells in the brain enabled humans to learn how to rub two stickstogether to create fire and, subsequently, to use fire to propel a rocket to themoon.It is profoundly important to emphasize that the nervous system is not atop-down means of authoritarian control but, rather, an interactivecommunication system. In the same manner that a nation’s government can generaterules and legislation for the populace, the brain can regulate certain bodilyfunctions. In much the same manner as news networks, the brain broadcasts theperceptions of the day to every one of the body’s 50 trillion cellular citizens.But, again, good governments and healthy bodies operate with a two-wayinformation exchange. Citizens can express their opinions by making telephonecalls or sending letters to their legislators, by voting, or by protesting inthe streets. Likewise, cellular citizens respond to information stimuli withinthe body by voicing their opinions to the central nervous system viacommunications that we perceive as emotions and symptoms—some of them gentle andsome of them violent.If the brain engenders wise and supportive governance, it will respond to thecellular community’s feedback with leadership that offers each cellular citizena life of healthful bliss. But, as is frequently demonstrated in our own world,if the brain is uninformed, out-of-touch, and unresponsive, it can stress acellular community to the point of breakdown, disease, and death, which are thebody’s equivalent to anarchy, destruction, and warfare in civil society.GROWTH, PROTECTION, AND THE BALANCE OF LIFEFor the last 150 years, Western civilization has chosen material science as itssource of truth and wisdom about the mysteries of life. Allegorically, we maypicture the wisdom of the Universe as resembling a large mountain. We scale themountain in order to acquire knowledge, and our drive to reach the top of thatmountain is fueled by the notion that, with enough proper knowledge, we couldbecome masters of the Universe. And that image of an all-knowing master maystimulate the iconic vision of a guru seated in a lotus position atop themountain of wisdom.Scientists are professional seekers, forging the path up the mountain ofknowledge. Their search takes them into the Universe’s uncharted unknowns. Witheach scientific discovery, humanity gains a better foot-hold to help scale themountain. Ascension is paved one scientific discovery at a time. Along the path,science occasionally encounters a fork in the road. Do they take the left or theright? When confronted with this dilemma, the direction science chooses isdetermined by the consensus of scientists who are interpreting the acquiredfacts—as they were understood at the time.Occasionally, scientists embark in a direction that ultimately leads to anapparent dead end. When that happens, they are faced with two choices: continueto plod forward with the hope that science will eventually discover a way aroundthe impediment, or return to the fork in the road and reconsider the alternativepath. Unfortunately, the more that science, and especially humanity, invests inone particular path, the more difficult it is to release the beliefs associatedwith that path, even if the chosen path leads to oblivion.In A Study of History, a 12-volume analysis of the rise and fall ofcivilizations, British historian Arnold Toynbee introduced the notion that thecultural mainstream clings to fixed ideas and rigid patterns even in the face ofimposing environmental challenges. He maintained that threatening challengeswould inevitably be resolved by what he described then as creative minorities.Known today as cultural creatives, these active agents of change transform old,outdated philosophical truths into new, life-sustaining cultural beliefs.2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en225]A Google search reveals that, currently, hundreds of thousands of culturalcreatives are working around the globe, each actively participating in acommunal effort to transform humanity. These cultural creatives will very likelybe the bearers of information that will bring about spontaneous evolution.The fundamental factors that cultural creatives must consider when assessing thesurvivability of humanity or any other living organism are elaborated in theSurvival Index presented earlier. Using this formula’s fundamental determinantsto score the current viability of human civilization reveals that we are failingon many fronts.028 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_028_r1.gif]In regard to the factor of global Resources, civilization is currently facing agrim future as shortages of nonrenewable materials threaten our way of life.Awareness of the threats posed by trashing the planet has led to a recent spateof survival-oriented books, videos, Websites, and activist movements, eachoffering green, life-sustainable alternatives. Every day, awakening culturalcreatives contribute to the development of renewable energy resources,recyclable products, and the return to organic farming.Considering the Efficiency factor, human civilization unequivocally receives thelowest score of all the living organisms on Earth. The United States and, to alesser degree, other Westernized cultures are trampling the biosphere with anenormously large footprint in regard to the planetary costs of maintaining theirexistence. The inefficiency of a fossil fuel-driven civilization and its cost interms of planetary desecration are legendary. The act of indiscriminatelyfouling Earth’s oceans, lakes, and rivers, and then paying exorbitant prices fora bottle of supposedly clean drinking water, is humanity’s inefficiency Edsel.The good news is that cultural creatives are currently out in force, providingnew ideas and thought to support humanity’s pass-or-fail crash course inEfficiency 101.The Protection factor directly influences the equation’s resources andefficiency categories. The fact that we have spent $15 trillion worth of energyand environmental resources on the military-industrial complex to fight oneanother is the most egregious example of inefficiency ever displayed in thebiosphere. Humanity will not survive if it continues to waste more people,money, and resources on what amounts to self-destruction. The self-healingprocess of turning our weapons into plowshares begins with this awareness.The Awareness factor is not only important to survival, it is the driving forcebehind evolution. Throughout human history, civilization has trod a tortuouspath where every twist and turn has been guided by an evolving andself-correcting collective awareness. The radically revised awareness of theUniverse and its operating principles offered by new-edge science indicates thathumanity is primed for an imminent and major course correction.The Internet, one of civilization’s most important technical advances, is set toplay a profoundly important role in humanity’s evolution. This informationnetwork offers every human cell with access to the technology an opportunity toinstantly receive and disseminate new life-enhancing awareness throughout thecommunity. In this sense, the Internet serves as humanity’s peripheral nervoussystem that interconnects humans from all over the globe and integrates theircollective awareness.Energy is the last, but certainly not least, of the factors affecting oursurvival. As the Survival Index emphasizes, energy is life. Consequently, thejudicious use of energy is a fundamental consideration when determining anorganism’s fate. The energy factor relates to the differential between theenergy spent by an organism and the energy its life processes generate.Second-grade arithmetic clearly demonstrates the consequences of spending morethan what is earned.LET THEM EAT GUNSGrowth and protection represent energy-expending work that is necessary fororganismal survival. Over the course of human history, there has been a gradual,yet steadily increasing imbalance in the energy expenditures allotted for growthversus that spent on protection. Physiologists recognize that similar imbalancesin the body’s energy distribution represent a primary cause of disease anddeath. The fractal reverberation of that unbalanced pattern is also having anegative effect on the vitality of civilization.An organism’s life-sustaining functions can be conveniently divided into thosethat support growth, which include reproduction, and those that provideprotection. From a study of individual cells in a culture dish, we can observe aphysiologic conflict between growth and protection behaviors.When nutrients are placed in front of a cell, the cell will move toward thenutrients, open and ready to assimilate them. When toxins are placed in front ofa cell, however, the cell will close down and move away from the threateningstimulus. Growth behaviors, expressed as openness and forward movement, arecompletely opposite of closed, retreating protection responses. Therefore, beingopen and closed or moving forward and backward at the same time are mutuallyexclusive, impossible behaviors. Simply, a cell cannot be in a state of growthand protection at the same time.3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en226]The first organisms to appear on Earth were free to abound in the absence ofthreatening predators. Consequently, the primary physiologic processes to evolvewere those designed to support growth. Later, the advent of species that livedoff of other organisms necessitated the development of effective protectionbehaviors, which were primarily designed for emergency situations.Ideally, energy is expended for growth and reproduction with as little aspossible spent on defense. This simple differential in energy allocations is dueto the fact that energy used for growth nets more energy for the system whileenergy used for protection offers no return on investment.That is why Nature designed protection systems with the hope that they wouldnever be used or, at worst, used sporadically to help organisms escape theoccasional clutches of life-threatening predators. Certainly, the body’s defensemechanisms were never intended nor designed to be used 24/7, as is too often thecase with great numbers of humanity today.Therefore, if an organism’s need for protection is out of balance and plagued bychronic ongoing fears and threats, the excessive energy resources required forprotection directly compromise energy reserves needed to sustain health.Based on functional responsibilities, cells that comprise the body can bedivided into two populations: those that contribute to the viscera and thosethat comprise the somatic system. The viscera are the fundamental organs relatedto bodily growth and maintenance, such as the digestive, respiratory, nervous,and reproductive systems. The somatic system, represented by the arms, legs, andouter wall of the body, provide protection, support, and mobility.When the body is in growth, the system primarily sends its energy to thevisceral organs while the somatic system plays a secondary role. In contrast,when faced with external threats, the body sends more blood to the somaticsystem to energize fight-or-flight responses while the visceral organs take abackseat to the action.When the body’s central intelligence identifies threatening signals from theexternal environmental, it activates a specialized system called theHypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. Regulatory signals released by theHPA axis primarily include stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol.These chemical signals constrict the blood vessels in the viscera, whichpreferentially redirects blood flow to the somatic system. There, the extrablood provides the energy, in the form of nourishment, to the muscles and bonesused to protect the body from those external threats. When the HPA axis isactivaited, the suppression of visceral blood effectively reduces energysupplies that would normally be used for growth.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en227]In severe situations, an organism will fight or flee until all of its accessibleenergy reserves are depleted and it falls victim to the predator. In thebest-case scenario, the intended prey escapes and is later able to shut down itsprotective HPA functions. The consequent cessation of stress hormone secretionthen allows an ample amount of blood to, once again, flow through the visceralveins, nourish the body’s growth mechanisms, and replenish expended energy.These same physiologic processes also apply to the cells of humanity when anation’s central voice signals a threat of attack. When danger is imminent,activation of the HPA axis has the same effect on a nation as it has onindividual citizens. Under such circumstances, a country diverts its energyreserves from growth to defense.This was strikingly apparent in the United States in the days followingSeptember 11, 2001, when fear of further attacks inhibited the country’s growthprocesses to such an extent that the economy stalled. Unaware ofgrowth-protection dynamics, President George W. Bush challenged the nation’sinnate biological intelligence by going on national television and trying tocoax growth by announcing, “America is open for business.”Similarly, the U.S. Department of Defense is the nation’s functional equivalentof the body’s protective adrenal system, which provides adrenaline and cortisolto fuel and mobilize fight or flight. When feeling threatened, the countrypreferentially directs its energy reserves to the military.Of course, this means the country must redirect funds from growth-orientedagencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services as well as theEnvironmental Protection Agency, which is the equivalent of the body’s immunesystem. Budget cuts in these departments inevitably compromise the growth andmaintenance of the country’s infrastructure. And, as with any living organism, acountry that drains its resources by maintaining a prolonged defense posture issusceptible to disruption and collapse.A vivid illustration of how regulated growth and protection responses affect anation was evident in the United States in the 1950s and ’60s when thegovernment scared the population into believing that Russia represented animminent threat to survival. In those years, people across the country weresubjected to frequent air raid drills during which blaring sirens signaled thepublic to flee to underground bomb shelters. Up to the moment of the warningsignal, communities were generally engaged in pleasurable and productive growthprocesses. However, after the air raid alarm was sounded, people ceased theirgrowth-related endeavors and sought the protection of the shelters.After the all-clear signal sounded, people returned to their jobs and thecommunity resumed its growth activities. However, consider the consequences ifthose were actual alerts and there was no all-clear signal. In that scenario,the population would be forced to stay in the protection posture. How long couldthey survive that way? For as long as their reserve of food, water, and otherenergy-sustaining supplies held out. After that, they would die.It’s easy to see that time spent in the bomb shelter is time away from commerceand other constructive human activities. However, shutting down growth processesinsidiously worsens the situation because workers in a state of protection areunable to re-provision their necessary, life-sustaining resources.With this human example, we see, again, as we did by watching cells presentedwith nutrients and toxins earlier, that protection and growth are mutuallyexclusive behaviors. As an example, the current protracted War on Terror that isbeing waged by the United States has bankrupted its reserves and profoundlycompromised its survival. Based on government-created fears, the U.S. has chosenguns over butter and, as a consequence, no longer has resources for either.We have linked the nation’s adrenal system to the role of the Department ofDefense. But let’s also consider that the name of this department and itsfunctions of war do not accurately reflect the parallel role played by thebody’s adrenal system. While the adrenal system is used for protectionresponses, it is also the primary system engaged when carrying out externalrescue responses, such as running into a burning building to save a child orpulling people to safety from raging flood waters. Occasionally, the Departmentof Defense engages in such life-sustaining efforts when it serves in disasterrelief operations or delivers food and medical supplies in humanitarianexercises, but, in contrast to the adrenal system, the military is more oftenengaged in a war campaign.Perhaps we should rename the military establishment as the Department ofMobility, a title that more accurately reflects the role of the adrenal system.Motivated by that name, we could maintain the function of a military-capableorganization without expressing our society’s collective belief in theperpetually adrenalizing necessity of war.MEN ARE FROM PROTEIN, WOMEN ARE FROM LIPIDSDelving deeper into the fractal pattern of life and culture reveals it is nocoincidence that a civilization dominated by patriarchal authoritariangovernments is preoccupied with protection while matriarchal civilizations focuson growth and fertility.Over the last several thousand years, human nature has tended to perceive theworld in terms of opposing polarities: good-bad, right-wrong, black-white,male-female, and spiritual-mechanical are just a few examples of these duelingdualities. But there is one profound and enduring duality that actually reflectsa basic property of chemistry.Two fundamental classes of molecules created from elements in the periodic tableexhibit profoundly different physicochemical properties. Referred to as polarand non-polar molecules, their differences are best understood in terms of waterand oil.Water molecules are polar, which means they have localized regions of positiveand negative charges. In that regard, they are analogous to magnets, which arealso distinguished by their opposing north and south polarities. Becauseopposite charges attract and form tight bonds, polar molecules can physicallyassemble into large, rigid structural complexes.Even though the chemical bonds that hold the atoms of an oil molecule togetherare highly energized, lipid molecules are non-polar because their polarizingcharges are evenly distributed throughout the molecule and, consequently, do notpossess localized sites of positive and negative charge.Chemical bonds that hold atoms together in a non-polar lipid molecule possesssix to ten times more energy than chemical bonds in an equal weight of polarizedprotein and carbohydrate molecules. This means that Nature uses non-polar lipidmolecules to store biological energy, a fact that is reflected in the body’saccumulation of fat. The relative absence of localized sites of attractive andrepulsive forces in non-polar molecules allows them to form fluid communities.However, the same non-polar character prevents lipids from assembling into rigidstructures.Filling a beaker with non-polar molecules is like filling it with atom-sizedping-pong balls. Because they do not bind to one another, each ball is free tomove and form fluid-like associations. In contrast, a beaker of polar moleculesmore closely resembles a beaker filled with nano-sized magnets thatautomatically assemble into a solid, tightly packed mass in which moleculesalign and couple their polar charges.Upon throwing a mixture of ping-pong balls and bar magnets into the same beaker,the tightly coupled polarized magnets would clump together and separate from theloosely organized ping-pong balls. This molecular imagery reveals why water’spolar molecules physically separate from oil’s non-polar molecules and why waterdroplets bead up while oil droplets flatten to a thin film.Interestingly, the first differential between masculine and feminine traits ismanifest in the difference between polar and non-polar molecules. Non-polarmolecules express a characteristic similar to females: when assembled together,they create a harmonious fluid community. In contrast, males resemble polarmolecules: when mixed together in a group, they engage in a power struggle asthe molecules self-assemble into a polarized, strongest-to-weakest hierarchy.The interaction of polar and non-polar molecules over time provided for the fourfundamental types of macromolecules, which are complexes comprised of very largenumbers of atoms. The fundamental building blocks of cells are macromoleculesthat include proteins, fats, sugars, and nucleic acids.Proteins are polar molecules; fats are non-polar lipids; and, interestingly, thereproduction-related nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, represent the union of polaramine groups and sugars derived from non-polar lipids.The origin of life was totally dependent on the cooperative interactions ofpolar and non-polar chemistry because, together, they created the primalbiological organelle, the cell membrane. The basic building block of the cellmembrane is the phospholipid, a molecule assembled from a polar phosphatechemical group and a non-polar lipid. Phospholipids simultaneously express bothpolar and non-polar traits and, in that capacity, are able to physicallyinterface with both realms.By providing a water-impermeable lipid boundary, the cell membrane’s femininelipids created a controllable internal environment, the primal womb, which, bydefinition, represents a place of origination and development. However, lifeonly arises within this womb through the cooperative action of polarizedmasculine proteins that physically support the cell membrane and, moreimportantly, generate movement, that is, the work that creates physiology andlife.The cytoplasmic organelles created in the original cellular womb can be dividedinto two functional categories based on whether they support the cell’s visceralfunctions or somatic functions. Visceral cytoplasmic elements are the membranousorganelles associated with growth and maintenance. The cell’s somatic elementsare primarily represented by a matrix of fibrous polar proteins that providesupport and motility. The membranous visceral organelles reflect the expressionof the feminine traits: growth and reproduction. The fibrous matrix of thesomatic system expresses masculine traits: physical support, protection, andmovement. V=Visceral realm: membranous organelles responsible for growth and reproductionS=Somatic realm: protein filaments responsible for support,protection, andmovement029 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_029_r1.gif]Visceral and somatic functions are complementary. In a state of growth, themembranous feminine visceral organelles are the primary contributors while themasculine matrix functions as support. However, when a cell is in danger, theseroles are reversed. In a state of protection, the masculine proteins protectwhile receiving supportive energy from the viscera.The structure and functions of the human body reflect a self-similar fractalpattern to that of the cell. Our organs of growth and reproduction are containedin our viscera, the gut, and our arms, legs, and body wall comprise our somaticsystem.The human male body is physically defined by its polarized proteins, the primarymacromolecules that characterize muscle. The musculature is a physical featurethat reflects the male’s primary role in providing support and protection. Incontrast, the human female body shape is defined by non-polar lipids, which areenergy-laden fat deposits that distinguish a woman’s figure from a man’s.The evolution of the super organism that is humanity also reveals amasculine-feminine duality. Western civilization’s focus on the physicalmaterial realm and technology reflects masculine traits that emphasizestructure, protection, and polarity. Eastern cultures were built on femininecharacteristics associated with spirituality, energy, growth, and harmony. Thepotential derived from male-female cooperation is implied in the old adage,“When East meets West.”In The Chalice and the Blade, Riane Eisler’s impressive research emphasized thatthe earliest European civilizations were feminine in character; they wereegalitarian, worshipped a Mother Goddess, and focused on agrarian endeavors.According to Eisler’s thesis, these cultures were systematically destroyed some5,000 years ago by invading Kurgans, who were wandering cattle herders from thesteppes of central Russia. These mobile tribes were technologically advanced andviolent warriors who overran and destroyed Europe’s peaceful egalitarianagrarian civilizations. In the wake of the Kurgan invasion, civilization adoptedits current masculine character of worshipping warring male gods in a societycontrolled by a hierarchy of male power mongers obsessed with control,protection, and technology.5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en228]The survival of civilization has been threatened by nearly five millennia oftestosterone-driven patriarchal authoritarian dominance. This one-sideddistortion in leadership has led to a gravely out-of-balance world thatemphasizes the masculine trait of protection at the expense of the feminine’slife-giving contributions for growth.In order to restore life and vitality to our world, it is now necessary toreintegrate the complementary values of the sacred feminine. Whether seen as areunion of East and West or a reunion of hemispheres—as with the South Americanmythology of the condor and the eagle—a balanced masculine-feminine field is thefirst step we must take to restore planetary health, love, and harmony.As we will learn in our unfolding conversation about how the body politic canmodel the success of the human body, an important key to our evolutionaryemergence resides in the reconciliation of what we currently perceive asopposites. Only by integrating formerly dueling dualities can we attain theunity that will shape our hopeful future.In the next chapter, we will play in the playing field where this integrationwill take place."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13THE ONE SUGGESTION“We are all one with the same One,the inescapable Oneness. The Universehas us surrounded. Might as well surrender!”— Swami Beyondananda Having submerged ourselves deep into the world of the micro—assessing thefascinatingly functional civilization of our cells—it’s now time to get macroand focus our attention on the environment that stretches way beyond our skin.Epigenetic science reveals that the story of life doesn’t end at the edge of ourbody; it only begins there. That’s because the fate of a living organism isdirectly influenced by information gleaned from its surrounding field.Biological behavior and genetic activity are directly formulated to complementan organism’s perception of its environment. In human biology, cell-controllingenvironmental stimuli are perceived and processed by the brain and interpretedby the machinations of the mind. The mind’s consciousness is then converted byepigenetic mechanisms into the physiology that controls the health and fate ofcells that comprise the human body.As Einstein emphasized, “The field is the sole governing agency of theparticle.” In human biology, the field is represented by the mind and theparticle is the body. While the brain is a physical mechanism, the mindrepresents a brain process and is, itself, a non-physical field of information.While properties of physical matter, such as the brain, conform to theprinciples of Newtonian or classical physics, the operation of the mind’s energyfields employ the fundamental mechanics of quantum physics. As described below,the mind is a primary factor in shaping the character of our lives. And, asspiritualists have long believed and physicists have discovered, much of what wecall reality might more accurately be seen as a figment of our imagination.HOW REAL IS REALITY?The fact that the mind of the observer influences the outcome of experiments isone of the most profound insights introduced by quantum mechanics. This newphysics acknowledges that we are not merely passive observers of our world but,rather, we are active participants in its unfolding. While almost everyonethinks that the physical world we observe is real, quantum physicists haveverified as fact that the world we observe is not real. Astrophysicists SirArthur Eddington and Sir James Jeans recognized this immediately when physicistsadopted the principles of quantum mechanics in 1925.Commenting on this mind-boggling insight, Jeans wrote: “ the stream of knowledgeis heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look morelike a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be anaccidental intruder into the realm of matter . . . we ought rather hail it asthe creator and governor of the realm of matter.” 1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en229]Interestingly, Einstein came to the same conclusion; however, he personallycouldn’t accept it as truth. Consequently, he spent the rest of his life—withoutsuccess—trying to repudiate this disconcerting implication inherent in quantummechanics.Quantum physics has absolutely verified that information processed by our mindsinfluences the shape of the world in which we live. With all that that impliesfor the meaning of human existence, why has this profound awareness not becomepart of our everyday world? As Eddington explained, “It is difficult for thematter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything isof mental character.”2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en230] Physicistshave shied away from this truth simply because it is so alien to their everydayperception of life.Conventional physics courses suggest that the principles of quantum mechanicsthat govern wave-particle interactions only apply at the level of atoms. Byrestricting quantum physics to the subatomic world, it has become a generalassumption that quantum mechanisms do not apply to our personal lives and worldaffairs. Therefore, today’s physicists have completely failed to inform thepublic of the purely mental nature of the Universe.Fortunately, leaders in the field, such as Johns Hopkins University physicistRichard Conn Henry, are addressing the misperceptions about the perceivedprimacy of the material world. Henry offered an elegantly simple definition onthe true nature of the Universe, “The Universe is nonmaterial—it is mental andspiritual. Live, and enjoy.”3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en231]Our minds actively co-create the world we experience. Consequently, by changingour beliefs, we have an opportunity to affect world change. While this profoundinsight represents a soundly grounded scientific principle, the questionsremain: “Does it work in practice? Are there studies or observations thatactually demonstrate that quantum mechanical principles apply to people andsociety? Does the energy field of the human mind truly influence the physicalcharacter of our world?”Theoretical physicist Amit Goswami sought an answer to these questions bydesigning an experiment to see if human behavior is influenced by quantummechanical activities. Goswami chose to work with the quantum principle ofnonlocality, a fundamental property displayed by subatomic particles such asphotons and electrons. As defined by this principle, the physical traits ofparticles become intimately connected, or entangled, once they interact with oneanother. If a characteristic of one of a pair of entangled particles is altered,for example, the change of its rotational spin from clockwise to counterclockwise, the other particle instantly responds with a complementary change ofits spin—even though vast distances may separate the particles. Einsteinreferred to nonlocality as “spooky action at a distance.”Goswami’s experiment was designed to see if the operation of the human mindexpressed the quantum property of nonlocality. Specifically, he asked whetherhuman brains could behave as entangled particles so that a change in activity ofone subject’s mind would induce a complementary change in the mind of anentangled partner. Goswami had pairs of subjects engage in a meditativeinteraction in which they were instructed to maintain direct communication, thatis, to feel each other’s presence at a distance.The subjects were separated by a distance of 50 feet and placed inelectromagnetically shielded Faraday chambers where their EEG activity wasmonitored. Goswami flashed a strobe light into one of the subject’s eyes,inducing an evoked potential, which is a distinctive electrical pattern thatreveals the brain’s response to a sensory stimulus.When individuals were mentally linked by meditation, eliciting an evokedpotential in one partner instantly induced an identical evoked potential in theentangled partner’s brain even though the second individual did not physicallyexperience the stimulus. This experiment demonstrates that activity in oneperson’s brain can influence the activity in the brain of a separated entangledpartner. The non-local transfer of potentials from brain to brain reveals thatthe brain has a quantum nature that operates at the macro level.4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en232]Large numbers of studies have observed that the minds of presumably frail andpowerless humans consciously and measurably influence the field, which, in turn,shapes our world. In this chapter, we will explore further evidence that, in thereal world of human actions and events, an invisible moving field does, indeed,exist—and that our thoughts, emotions, and actions are important in how thatfield is shaped. We will provide information regarding how our thoughts,empowered by feelings in our hearts, can be harnessed to bring about peace andharmony in our world.We end the chapter with a suggested path of action—a human operating system, ifyou will—that will support the success of our species. The one suggestion thatwe suggest is based on information that has been handed down by spiritualteachers throughout the ages, information that is now resoundingly confirmed bynew-edge science.THE FIELD EXPERIMENTSHistory acknowledges that the Wright Brothers flew a heavier-than-air aircraftin 1903. But it wasn’t until seven years later, when people actually saw aphotograph of President Theodore Roosevelt in an airplane that the averageAmerican finally realized that flight was possible. If you had the opportunityto ask the typical person on the street up to the moment that picture appeared,“When will humans fly?” the answer would likely have been, “When pigs fly!” In asimilar way, the average person today is unfamiliar with the new sciences thatincontrovertibly demonstrate the existence of an invisible energy field thatinfluences life.Since the founding of modern science, researchers have been on a mission tounderstand the domain of the observable and measurable Universe. That whichcould not be seen—and could not be measured—was, by definition, outside therealm of science. While mystical and religious thought has always expressedbelief in what physicists named the field, it is only in the past century thatscience has developed the instrumentation to definitively measure the field’sexistence and its influence.Biomedical scientists bold enough to explore outside the bounds of conventionalNewtonian explanations are now discovering a vast and uncharted playing fieldthat seems to defy the conventional laws of the physical Universe. That thisplaying field is also a praying field indicates that experience and knowledgeare leading us into a domain where science and spirit merge to becomecooperative evolutionary forces.Just as surely as we are aware of the presence of an invisible field when weobserve iron filings arranging themselves around a magnet, we can now actuallysee the presence of life-influencing invisible energy fields through use ofadvanced medical scanning technologies such as CAT scans, MRI scans, PET scans,and sonograms.While scanned images may reveal cancers and symptoms of other diseases, it isimportant to realize that scans are not actual photographs of physical tissuesand internal organs; if they were, the images would show only external skin.Rather, scan images are visualizations of invisible radiant energy fields, andthe characteristics of the invisible field are an energy complement of thebody’s physical reality.Most scan technologies are employed to read the character of energy fieldswithin the body. However, there are a number of new technologies that actuallyread energy fields that radiate from our bodies into the environment.Instruments have been designed that detect a beating heart’s powerful electricand magnetic fields meters away from its source. Field-influencingelectromagnetic messages broadcasted from our hearts have been shown to entanglewith the hearts of others in the field.Similarly, a new scanning system, magneto-encephalography (MEG), actually readsthe brain’s neural energy patterns through a probe that is some distance fromthe body. MEG technology provides physical proof that brain activity isbroadcast into the environment in the same way that a tuning fork radiates asound through the field.TIME ISN’T WHAT IT USED TO BEJust as surely as we humans thought we knew a century ago that we couldn’t fly,most of us today have been programmed to believe that time is an absolute thatmoves in only one direction. Well, maybe. Maybe not.As startling as it may seem, researcher Dean Radin, author of Entangled Minds,and journalist Lynne McTaggart, author of The Field and The IntentionExperiment, offer proof that sometimes we respond to future events ahead oftime. Consider the experiment where subjects are wired to biometric equipmentthat registers emotional reactions. They are shown a succession of slide images,the vast majority of which are peaceful and pleasing. But about 3 percent of thepictures—randomly interspersed—are shocking images portraying sex or violence.Subjects registered an emotional response to the disturbing images secondsbefore those pictures actually appeared on the screen. How can this be, givenour current concept of linear and progressive time?5[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en233]Or, consider Dr. Radin’s surprising studies with random number generators, whichare computers programmed to continuously generate sequences of numbers in anerratic fashion. When graphically mapped out, the computer’s number sets displaya random pattern—except on rare occasions. Exceptions are distinguished by thefact that, at those times, the number sets are no longer random but unexpectedlyexpress pattern and coherence.The amazing part of the story is that the loss of randomness usually occurredwhen there was a global event that simultaneously captured the attention of avast number of people. Apparently, it doesn’t seem to matter what or how peoplethink or feel about the event, only that their attention is coherently focusedon the same event. This commonly occurs each year at the time of the Super Bowl,but it has also been noted during three events that had the world’s focusedattention: the O. J. Simpson trial, the funeral of Princess Diana, and theattack on the World Trade Center.6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en234]Now here is where Einstein’s “spooky action at a distance” becomes evenspookier. When the pattern of spikes in global coherence is mapped on to agraph, it creates a typical bell-shaped curve. Nothing unusual about that,except that, in this case, the devices that plot the bell-shaped graph over timereveal that numbers begin to get more coherent at a particular time before theevent. Thus, it was that two hours prior to when the first plane hit the WorldTrade Center on September 11, the number generators were already responding topre-verberations of the shocking moment!7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en235]Helmut Schmidt, a German-born physicist and psi researcher of purported psychicabilities, had long been interested in the relationship between the observer andthe observed phenomenon. Having observed that the observer could influencerandom events through intention, Schmidt posed a deliciously intriguingquestion: could an observer influence the outcome of that event—even if it hadalready happened?8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en236]Schmidt connected his random number generator to an audio device that wouldrecord a click in either the left or right ear of a set of headphones. He thenmade a number of recordings of the number generator’s left-right output; makingsure that no one, including himself, could observe the results. A day later, avolunteer was given a recorded tape and told to mentally influence the outcomeso that more clicks would occur on one side than the other.Schmidt compared the distribution of left-right clicks on influenced tapes withthose on uninfluenced control recordings. While control tapes showed purelyrandom results, to his surprise, Schmidt found that his subjects influenced thedistribution of clicks on tapes recorded two days earlier!Interestingly, this time travel experiment only worked if the recorded clickswent unobserved until after the volunteer had a chance to influence them. Ifanyone observed the original results before the time the experiment wasconducted, their observations could not be subsequently influenced.The implications of this experiment are mind-boggling and paradigm busting.Sometimes psychic healers report healing a condition by going back to a timebefore the condition existed. While this sounds like a bunch of woo-woo hoodoo,the laws of quantum mechanics suggest it may, in fact, be possible. If nothingelse, Radin’s and Schmidt’s experiments provoke us to seriously reconsider thecommonly accepted idea of linear time because that concept now appears to be abit shaky. And what is it that exists beyond time? The field.THE PLAYING FIELD AS A PRAYING FIELDNot only do these studies challenge our concept of time, this research alsocalls into question our notions of distance and space. Interestingly, some ofthe most far-out, woo-woo experiments have been in the service of the mostpractical matters—like national defense. In his book Miracles of Mind, physicistRussell Targ describes his participation in CIA-SPONSORED remote viewingexperiments at the Stanford Research Institute.Remote viewing is a specialized practice of clairvoyance that was developed bythe military to explore enemy installations halfway around the globe. Personsadept at remote viewing are told a latitude-longitude coordinate. “Adepts,” asthey are called, then enter into what amounts to be a deep meditation. While inthat altered state, the adept can actually describe landscapes and structures atthe provided location even though they have never been there.According to Targ, one of the more gifted remote viewers was Pat Price, who hadbeen the Police Commissioner of Burbank, California. In an experiment sponsoredby the CIA, Price was given only the latitude and longitude of what turned outto be a Soviet nuclear weapons laboratory in Siberia. With nothing but thosecoordinates to go on, he was able to sketch the plant with incredible precision.Satellite photos later confirmed the remarkable accuracy of his sketches.9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en237]These and similar remote viewing experiments demonstrate that the fieldtranscends distance as well as time. The implications are profound, not only forlong-distance spying but also for long-distance healing.Genetic determinism aside, Russell Targ’s willingness to apply science to themysteries of life was passed down to his daughter, Elisabeth Targ. Elisabeth wasa rigorously trained medical doctor, scientist, and psychiatrist who was curiousabout the emerging science of psychoneuroimmunology, the study of how anindividual’s psychology controls the activity of their immune system.The Institute of Noetic Sciences recruited Elisabeth in 1995 to conductexperiments on the effectiveness of remote prayer on healing. Having grown up ina household where science was considered to be religion, she had a naturalskepticism about the value of prayer in any form. Nonetheless, she had observedfrom her father’s work that there were, indeed, mysterious ways through whichthe mind could influence the field.Elisabeth’s directive was to design an impeccable experiment that woulddetermine if positive or negative thoughts actually influence events. To answerthat question, Targ and her co-researcher Fred Sicher chose to study if prayercould influence the progression of AIDS. As subjects for their experiment, Targand Sicher selected a homogenous population of AIDS patients who were expressingthe same degree of illness.They employed 40 religious and spiritual healers, from evangelical Christians toNative American shamans and just about everything in between, in a double-blindstudy wherein no one but the healers knew which patients were receiving healingprayers. All healers had one thing in common—they all had a history ofsuccessfully treating what the medical community referred to as hopeless cases.Twenty patients were divided into two groups. Each group received the exact samestandard medical treatment, but only one group was the focus of remote healingprayers. The healers never met their patients and were only provided with aname, a photo, and a T-cell count. Each of the 40 healers was asked to “hold anintention for the health and well-being” of a patient one hour a day, six days aweek, for ten weeks. With 40 healers praying for ten patients, each patient wasthe recipient of healing prayers from four different healers over the ten-weekperiod.The results of the study were so astounding that Targ almost didn’t believethem. After six months, four of the ten patients in the control group that didnot receive prayers group had died. In contrast, all ten patients in the healedgroup were not only still alive, they all reported feeling better, and thissubjective assessment was substantiated by objective medical analysis. Targ andSicher repeated the experiment with 50 separate control factors that couldpossibly influence the outcome. Once again, those who received healing prayersscored significantly healthier in all parameters measured.10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en238]Targ and Sicher’s experiments confirm and extend similar results from a numberof other investigations on the effectiveness of healing prayer. In all studies,it didn’t appear to make any difference in regard to the remote healer’sreligion or method of prayer, the healer had only to convey a healing intention.The most successful healers expressed humility by stating that some higher forcewas working through them.THE SCIENCE OF PRAYEROne thing should be clear by now. While we may not know exactly how the fieldoperates, we do know it exists. And, although we cannot quite take the fieldapart like a Swiss watch to see what makes it tick, we can still use it toinfluence our reality. After all, it’s been hundreds of years since Newtondescribed gravity, and, even though we still cannot explain it, we use gravityevery day to keep things from flying off our table.In addition to those published by Elisabeth Targ, a large number of scientificreports have also assessed the power of prayer. Medical doctor Larry Dossey,author of Healing Words and Prayer Is Good Medicine, reviewed more than 60scientific studies that provide evidence of prayer having a measurable impact onhealing. These studies collectively reveal that, regardless of which religion orform the prayer takes, without love and compassion, the prayer has little or noeffect. Dossey concluded that the best healing attitude is expressed by theBuddhist injunction, “Have good heart!” According to Dossey, this means “caringdeeply with no hidden agendas.”11 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en239]Dossey states that prayer is not something we do—it is what we are. Gregg Bradenderived a similar conclusion. While in the Himalayas, Braden asked a Buddhistabbot to explain the intention of monks chanting for 14 to 16 hours a day.Specifically, he asked, “When we see your prayers, what are you doing?” The monkreplied, “You’ve never seen our prayers, because a prayer cannot be seen. Whatyou’ve seen is what we do to create the feeling in our bodies. Feeling is theprayer!”12 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en240]Similarly, Braden once asked a Native American rainmaker what he did when heprayed for rain. “I don’t pray for rain,” the shaman corrected him. “I prayrain.” In other words, the shaman embodied the experience of rain. He felt whatit felt like to have rain fall onto his body, his bare feet in the wet mud. Hesmelled the rain and imagined himself walking through rain-nourished fields ofcorn. From his extensive research on the nature of prayer, Braden concluded thatwe communicate with the field through the language of emotion, by experiencingthe intent of the prayer as if it has already occurred.13[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en241]Mentally and emotionally experiencing the desired outcome of a prayer before thereality exists makes sense in the world of quantum mechanics. Physicistsacknowledge that the mind is a primary influence when creating reality.Consequently, consider the state of an individual’s mind when he or she ispraying for something. That person is manifesting a mental field characterizedby lack or need. Because the field influences the shape of the material realm, afield that emphasizes lack will contribute to the creation of a complementaryreality that embodies lack. In contrast, if the person’s mind were to manifest amental and emotional experience of already having realized his or her desire,that mental field would transform the prayer into a matching physical reality.Dossey and Braden agree on one thing in particular and that is the importance ofnon-attachment in prayer. The apparent paradox that seems to hold the key tobreakthrough is to care deeply and yet not be attached to the outcome. InSecrets of the Lost Mode of Prayer, Braden reports a discrepancy between theclassic Biblical injunction on the nature of prayer: “Ask and ye shall receive”and the original Aramaic translation: “Ask without hidden motive and besurrounded by your answer—be enveloped by what you desire that your gladness befull.”14 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en242]The original Biblical instruction on how to pray offers, as a first step, “Askwithout hidden motive.” This is the same directive that Dossey attributes to theBuddhist prayer intention of having “. . . no hidden agendas.” This simply meansnot having attachment to the outcome or how that outcome must manifest.Interestingly, the secret to successful prayermaking leaves us with acrazy-making paradox: “In order to have something, you must at once desire it,yet not be attached to getting it.”15 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en243]Braden offers a thoughtful reason behind the necessity of detachment when hesuggests that most prayers are ego-based wishes for individual selves who arerarely aware of the consequences that realizing those personal desires may haveon the lives of other individuals or on the greater good. The intelligence ofthe field, expressed Biblically as “Thy will be done,” often has a much biggerplan up its very, very big sleeve.The second caveat of the Bible’s injunction on creative praying reads, “besurrounded by your answer.”16 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en244] Thissimply means to physiologically and emotionally experience the desired intentionas if it already has occurred. This is precisely the activity of Buddhist monksand Native American shamans who pray by internally creating the experience ofwhat they desire, as if it already existed. Modern physicists offer the sameinsight on prayer and manifestation, even though they prefer to consider it interms of fields influencing matter.Engaging an emotional experience plays an important physiologic role in themanifestation of prayer. Emotions link consciousness with the experientialphysical realm because they represent the bridge between thought and thechemistry of feelings. Now we truly come to the heart of the matter—for theheart is the mind’s powerhouse that amplifies and broadcasts our emotionalinformation into the Universe.THE SACRED HEART AND COHERENCEIn the world of scientific materialism, the heart is merely a muscle—a veryimportant muscle, but a muscle and nothing more. However, in Chinese medicine,the heart is considered the center of wisdom, and, in the ancient Vedictradition, the heart is the mediator between Heaven and Earth.Ancient Ayurvedic philosophy contends that the body possesses seven chakras,which are force centers considered to be focal points for the reception andtransmission of the body’s vital energies. The powerful heart chakra lies in thecenter between three higher and three lower chakras. The higher crown, thirdeye, and throat chakras are energy centers of consciousness and communication.The lower solar plexus, sacral, and root chakras represent the physical domainand bodily emotions. If ever there were a gateway between the above and thebelow, the heart chakra would certainly be it.Once again, modern science is confirming ancient wisdom, this time in relationto the influential role of the heart. In 1992, stress researcher Doc Childrefounded the Institute of HeartMath as a scientific research center dedicated toinvestigating the notion that the heart possesses powerful wisdom and might holdthe key to the spontaneous evolution of our species.Childre and a cadre of HeartMath researchers amassed data from a variety of newscan technologies that reveals the ancients were right in regard to the heart’sinfluence on life. In their book, The HeartMath Solution, Childre and co-authorHoward Martin concluded, “Heart intelligence is the intelligent flow ofawareness that we experience once the mind and bodily emotions are brought intobalance and coherence.”17 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en245]To paraphrase an old Connie Frances song, our heart does, indeed, have a mind ofits own. In the 1970s, physiologists John and Beatrice Lacey of the FelsResearch Institute discovered that the heart possesses its own independentnervous system, which they referred to as “the brain of the heart.” At least40,000 neurons in the heart are used to communicate with consciousness-relatedbrain centers including the amygdala, the thalamus, and the cerebral cortex.When first discovered, scientists assumed these cardiac neurons were used tosimply process signals sent from the brain above.18[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en246]The Laceys’ research revealed an entirely different scenario. Their studiesshowed that the heart does not automatically obey the brain’s messages but thatit actually interprets neural signals and bases a response on the individual’scurrent emotional status. The Laceys concluded that the heart employs its owndistinctive logic and that heartbeats are not merely the mechanical rhythms oflife but, rather, represent an intelligent language.19[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en247] Analyses of EKG patterns demonstratethat the heart has far more to do with perceptions and behavioral reactions thanWestern science has ever imagined.HeartMath researchers confirmed what religion, poetry, and our own intuitionhave been telling us since the beginning of human awareness. The heart is theinterface between consciousness and the physiologic responses that generateemotions. What’s more, they found that the impact of love, itself, is real andbiochemically measurable.Childre and Martin’s research led to specific techniques for accessing what theyrefer to as coherent heart intelligence. When subjects focus their attention onthe heart and activate a core heart feeling, such as love, appreciation, orcaring, these emotions immediately shift their heartbeat rhythms into a morecoherent pattern. Increasing heartbeat coherence activates a cascade of neuraland biochemical events that affect virtually every organ in the body.Studies demonstrate that heart coherence leads to more intelligence by reducingthe activity of the sympathetic nervous system—our fight or flightmechanism—while simultaneously increasing the growth-promoting activity of theparasympathetic nervous system. The relaxation response produced by heartcoherence reduces production of the stress hormone cortisol and redirects itschemical precursors to produce the anti-aging hormone dehydroepiandrosterone(DHEA). Cultivated feelings of love, compassion, caring, and appreciationinfluence our physiology so as to provide us with healthier, happier, and longerlives.20 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en248]Science has actually tracked the pathway by which love heals! By focusingattention on our heart, we increase synchronization between the heart and brain,which, in turn, calms our nervous system and deactivates the stress response.When operating in a state of heart coherence, the body conserves vital energyfor growth and maintenance.The heart’s influence on the field is empowered by its own electromagneticactivity that is 5,000 times more powerful than the brain’s electromagneticfield. Current technology can read the heart’s energy field up to ten feet awayfrom the body. Feelings such as love generate measurable, quantifiable heartfield coherence, while negative emotions create incoherence and disharmony inthe heart’s field.The heart broadcasts our emotions into the world around us and is, likewise,influenced by emotions broadcast by others. When an individual connects withanother person through either physical touch or simply by caring, the electricalactivity of the two communicating hearts and brains become entangled and beginto entrain with one another. This research offers even more profoundimplications for activating a coherent worldwide healing field because itreveals that the healing coherence of love is contagious and can rapidly spreadthroughout a population.These observations suggest that the emotional coherence or incoherence of largegroups of people can profoundly influence the greater field. The Institute ofHeartMath has recently launched a worldwide experiment to test this hypothesisby enlisting the efforts of large numbers of participants across the planet.Their Global Coherence Initiative is a science-based initiative designed toassess the coordinated influence of millions of people who consciously practicewhat they define as “heart-focused care and intention to shift globalconsciousness from instability and discord, to balance, cooperation and enduringpeace.”21 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en249]Can our intentions purposefully change Earth’s field? Please stay attuned.ENTRAINING WHEELS FOR THE NEXT CYCLEHeartMath’s Global Coherence Initiative is not the first study to measure theimpact of focused coherent concentration by large numbers of people on thephysical world. Practitioners of Transcendental Meditation (TM), a techniquebrought to America by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, launched an experiment in two dozenAmerican cities in the early 1970s. The Maharishi claimed that when the squareroot of one percent of a given population practiced this form of meditation,there would be a reduction in crime in the surrounding area.22[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en250]While this might seem like an outrageous claim by someone who supposedly was thesubject of the Beatles’ song “Fool on the Hill,” it turns out that the MaharishiEffect is, indeed, real. Interestingly, not only is crime significantly reducedwhile these studies are going on, but other markers of coherence, including adecline in emergency room visits, are experienced as well.In a well-documented 1993 study, TM practitioners converged on Washington, D.C.,during the hot summer months of June and July. Despite a near-record summer heatwave—something that statistically correlates with a higher crime rate—crimebegan to decrease and continued to decrease throughout the duration of theexperiment. When the experiment was over and the meditators went home, curiouslyenough, the crime rate immediately began to rise again! The observed decrease incrime in that area, as substantiated by FBI Uniform Crime Statistics, could notbe accounted for through analyses of any other known variables. Statistically,the likelihood that these results could be attributed to coincidence is lessthan two chances in a billion.23 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en251]Are these results something that can only be achieved through TranscendentalMeditation, or are there other ways and techniques for impacting fieldcoherence?Two different coherence-creating projects, Lynne McTaggart’s IntentionExperiment24 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en252] and Common Passion,25[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en253] are seeking answers to that question.Joe Giove, executive director of Common Passion, wrote: “Imagine a massiveglobal collaborative of peace-creating groups whose purpose is social harmony,comprised of members from every religion, meditation practice, and indigenousgroup. They would come together locally and globally, learn how to apply thefindings of prior social studies, and develop an open-source technology thatvalidated the social harmonizing effects of their combined efforts.”26[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en254]Giove proposes an ambitious, yet worthy, undertaking that offers individuals theopportunity to gather and focus human love under one big intent. As is often thecase when a new context emerges, evidence of the phenomenon begins to appeareverywhere.In his recent book, Awakening into Oneness, Arjuna Ardagh reports on what henamed the Oneness Blessing, a practice referred to as deeksha in India.According to Ardagh, the blessing is a form of coherence that can be transferredfrom one individual to another. Ardagh reports that the Oneness Blessing, basedon the work of Sri Bhagavan and his wife Sri Amma, founders of OnenessUniversity in India, produced a profound local transformation in the vicinity ofthe university that is strikingly similar to the Maharishi Effect.When Sri Bhagavan originally moved his center to near the small village ofVaradaiahpalem, it was typical of the poor towns in that part of India. Inaddition to poverty—most families lived in one-room mud huts with no runningwater, sewage, or electricity—there were rampant social problems, includingalcoholism, physical violence, and spousal abuse. Bhagavan proposed adoptingvillages and offering residents instructions on the Oneness Blessing so they,too, could increase their happiness.At first, only 30 or 40 people from surrounding villages took the invitation tolearn this technique. However, coherence is contagious. Soon, more and morepeople began attending, and, within 5 years, as many as 6,000 residents wereattending Oneness Blessing classes. According to Ardagh, who visited thevillages and interviewed the inhabitants, alcohol consumption was reduced morethan 80 percent of what it had been five years earlier and drunken brawls in thestreets had become a rarity. Numerous community work projects were created andemployment was available for anyone who wanted to work.27[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en255]As with so many reports regarding the healing power of love, prayer, andcoherence, Ardagh’s account is officially anecdotal, based more on personalobservation than scientific rigor. For those who’ve experienced such phenomenafirsthand, the need for rigor might seem redundant or unnecessary. Yet, there issomething profoundly transformational when science, itself, explores the blurredboundary between the visible and the invisible, particularly when it comes tomeasuring something as immeasurable as love.WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?Two other notable experiments offer evidence regarding how something assupposedly unscientific as emotions can have a measurable physical impact onmatter—at a distance!Let’s begin with the intriguing research of Bernard Grad, a Canadian biologistwho carried out experiments in the field of paranormal healing. Rather thanstudying human patients, Grad focused on plants. He found that when a psychichealer transmitted energy to a beaker of water, seeds soaked in that water grewnoticeably taller and more rapidly than plants from control seeds grown inpsychically untreated water. In another of his studies, Grad had psychiatricpatients, including one severely depressed man, hold beakers of water that wouldlater be used to sprout seeds. The water held by the patients and, in particularby the depressed man, clearly inhibited the plants’ growth.28[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en256] Further studies showed that healersactually produced a physical change in the structure of water that was assessedby studying its spectroscopic absorption of infrared light.29[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en257] These changes demonstrated greaterstructural coherence of the water molecules after it was exposed to the hands ofthe healer and a lesser coherence when the depressed man influenced the water.Grad extended these studies and found that healers could also provoke a slowingof the growth of tumors in laboratory rats.Further evidence that thoughts and emotions can alter cellular reality isprovided in the work of physician and healer Leonard Laskow. Like so many ofthose who find themselves at the forefront of this new paradigm, Laskow beganhis career in traditional medicine. It was a twist of fate that changed hisdirection and led him to a healing experience so profound that his life worktook off in a totally unpredictable direction. In 1971, Laskow was a successfulOB/GYN and surgeon with a thriving practice in Northern California. A pain inhis shoulder led to x-rays that revealed a lesion, which is often an indicationof bone cancer.As a doctor, Laskow already knew the treatment protocol was amputation. And,while there had been a one-armed outfielder who played major league baseballwhen everyone else was in the military service during World War II, it’sexceedingly difficult to perform surgery single-handedly. While awaiting histest results, Laskow accepted that, even with one arm, he could still be ofservice as a health counselor.A few weeks later, the test results showed the lesion to be a simple benigncyst. However, over the interim, Laskow pondered his fate and decided that achange was in order. He left his stressful medical practice and focused hisattention on studying the mental and emotional facets of healing.A short while later, Laskow received the following message while in ameditation: “Your work is to heal with love.” The message left him awestruck andhumbled. He realized that his decision to go into medicine in the first placewas predicated on the desire to be a healer, and traditional medicine was theaccepted mode. Laskow’s meditation awakened him to a new healing vision, “Ibelieve that we all have to learn, in some point in our evolution, to heal withlove.”30 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en258]A few years later, Laskow found himself at a retreat where his room-mate was ayoung man suffering from metastasized cancer. When the young man woke up in themiddle of the night in pain and with troubled breathing, Laskow wanted to helpbut was unsure what to do. “Acting purely on intuition,” Laskow reported, “Iplaced my hands on the sides of his chest and visualized a radiant ball of lightcoming down through the center of my head to the level of my heart, then down myarms and out through my hands.”31 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en259]The young man calmed down, told Laskow his pain was gone, and slept through thenight. Fast-forward 11 years and Leonard Laskow found himself at anotherconference where this same young man was singing on stage. He told Laskow abouta miraculous spontaneous remission he had about six weeks after his encounter atthe previous retreat. Did Laskow’s work precipitate the healing? Or was it apre-verberation of what would happen six weeks later? Clearly, there was arelationship, and it caused Laskow to engage in some intriguing experiments inhealing with love.While Laskow has reported amazing anecdotal results of his healing work withpatients, his most scientific experiment involved working with cancer cells in apetri dish. This protocol was chosen because cultured cells could bebiochemically monitored in a laboratory. Laskow held three culture dishes thatcontained tumor cells in his hand while maintaining a state of focused healingconsciousness. As an experimental control, a non-healer in another room held inhis hands three other Petri dishes, inoculated with the same tumor cells. Thenon-healer was assigned a reading task while holding the cultures so that hewould be distracted from influencing the cultured cells with his own intentions.Laskow experimented with several different emotional intentions while holdingthe cells, all of which sought to activate the natural force of coherence in theUniverse. The most effective intention, the one that caused the cancer cells todiminish their growth by 39 percent, was: “Return to the natural order andharmony of the normal cell line.” When Laskow added visual imagery to theintention, the healing effect doubled.32[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en260]So, what’s love got to do with it? As Laskow reports in his book Healing WithLove, his intention was not to destroy the cancer cells but to allow them toexist as part of universal creation. Love, he explained, is the “impulse towardunity, non-separation, wholeness. While love can take many forms, its essence isrelatedness.”33 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en261] Laskow believes thatthe opposite of love is not hate but separation. While there are many differentmodes for accessing and using healing energy, Laskow’s protocol involvesconnecting with the condition instead of separating from it.When we experience an illness or a life condition that we would prefer not tohave, our first impulse is to cast it out. We tend to think of illness as aforeign invader that attacks us rather than something we co-create. However,when we truly own our participation in the condition, even if we don’tunderstand the reason, we become responsible participants in directing our fate.With the awareness that our mind shapes our biology, we can recognize that wehave the opportunity to change our minds and, thus, create a healthier biology.Given what we now know about the intelligence and functionality of our cells,maybe we can begin by humbly apologizing to our inner citizens and thank themfor putting up with us! When we take the step of consciously loving our cells,we affirm that we are co-creating participants, not victims of life.An illness or disharmonious condition occurs when something is misformed ordeformed. Healing, therefore, involves transformation to change thedysfunctional form. Here is Laskow’s simple four-step transformational healingprocess:34 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en262]• Step One: Inform yourself about what has already materialized in form. Tellingthe truth is the first step toward responsibility.• Step Two: Conform to the condition by loving it rather than creatingseparation. Resonating with the form allows us more influence over itsorganization.• Step Three: Unform the condition by releasing it. “It is the observer’sintent,” said Laskow, “that converts particulate matter to its wave form and itswave form back into matter.”• Step Four: Reform the released energy to conform to our purpose and desire.This is the letting go part where we send our intention into the Universewithout attachment.Even when releasing the diseased condition, there is connection and notseparation. Laskow wrote: “When you accept and love the parts of yourself youwant to reject or change, you create an opportunity to discover the positivelife force behind them.”35 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en263] That oldBiblical word atonement can be reinterpreted as at-one-ment through which wemake ourselves at one with whatever condition we would have otherwise rejected.In the quantum Universe where everything is connected, love is the glue thatholds things together. Said Laskow, “Love is a universal pattern of resonantenergy.”36 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en264] In this sense, two or moretuning forks vibrating together are in love with each other, just as two or morehumans can resonate in a palpable field of connectedness, joy, and even ecstasy.Love, he said, “is the universal harmonic.”Leonard Laskow’s work brings up an intriguing and transformational question. Ifwe can “love a cancer cell to death,” or at least to the point of relativeharmlessness, can we also love terrorists and other human sociopathogens andrender them harmless, too? Can embracing these individuals, groups, and evennations as a manifestation of our own need to heal be the key to a new quantumpolitics?THE ONE SUGGESTIONScience suggests that the next stage of human evolution will be marked byawareness that we are all interdependent cells within the super-organism calledhumanity. And just as surely as the seeker who climbs Mount Awareness and findsBuddha patiently waiting at the top with his words of wisdom, there is anequally valuable one suggestion waiting for us when we boil most religiousthought down to its golden essence. The nearly universal suggestion offered bymost of the world’s spiritual systems is to practice some version of the GoldenRule.Cited below are a few examples of how the Golden Rule has been incorporated intothe world’s major religions:37 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en265]• Buddhism: Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.(Udana-Varga 5,1)• Christianity: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do yeso to them; for this is the law of the prophets. (Matthew 7:1)• Confucianism: Do not do to others what you would not like yourself. Then therewill be no resentment against you, either in the family or in the state.(Analects 12:2)• Hinduism: This is the sum of duty; do naught onto others what you would nothave them do unto you. (Mahabharata 5:1517)• Islam: No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that whichhe desires for himself. (Sunnah)• Judaism: What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow-man. This is theentire Law; all the rest is commentary. (Talmud, Shabbat 3id)• Taoism: Regard your neighbor’s gain as your gain, and your neighbor’s loss asyour own loss. (Tai Shang Kan Yin P’ien)• Zoroastrianism: That Nature alone is good which refrains from doing anotherwhatsoever is not good for itself. (Dadis-ten-I-dinik, 94:5)Could these spiritual practices be trying to tell us something? Perhaps the mostprofound difference between children of God and adults of God is that childrenof God worship the lawgiver while adults of God strive to live the law.Again, while the Golden Rule is only a suggestion, it is based on experience.Robert Thurman, Professor of Buddhist Studies at Columbia University,emphasized, “Buddhism isn’t a religion, it’s a practice.”38[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en266] What makes the practice practical,said Thurman, is that it works.Thurman stated that Buddhism is based on rationalism because Buddhists believehuman fate is not determined by God, but by a causal system called karma.Thurman said, “In the karmic system, one kind of action is systematically moresuccessful than another in enhancing a being’s existence.”39[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en267]As we come to understand the relatedness of all things, we see that actions arerelated to consequence. The Buddhist understanding of karma resonates with bothJesus’ message to love thy neighbor and the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, “thehealing of the world.”Although the one-suggestion operating system has been passed down throughout theages by great religious teachers, up until now, in the face of fear,manipulation, and disempowering programming, humans have done everythingpossible to avoid putting it into operation. Now, with species’ survival atstake, we must recognize, once and for all, that the tired argument of religionversus science can no longer be used to avoid accepting our own power andresponsibility as conscious co-creators of our reality.Those citizens among us who have been infected with the dominator virus haveconvinced the rest of us that their inhuman nature is the only form of humannature. However, now that we have insight into the nature of our programming andhave seen the very wide range of behaviors that humans are capable ofexpressing, we must recognize that we can choose the nature of our human nature.There is the famous story of a Native American grandfather talking to hisgrandchild. “There are two wolves fighting inside of me,” said the grandfather.“One is the wolf of love and peace, the other is the wolf of anger and war.”“Which one will win?” asked the grandchild. “Whichever one I feed,” was thegrandfather’s reply.In a certain sense, all the complexity of philosophy and human history that wehave been relating in Spontaneous Evolution boils down to this one simplechoice. We can divert and delude ourselves into waiting for an external messiahwith a magic wand, or we can withdraw in resignation to the chaotic evil of thisworld.Or, better yet, we can take a hint from the Buddhists who emulate thebodhisattvas; these are persons able to reach nirvana but delay doing so out ofcompassion and in order to save suffering beings. Referred to as “workingmessiahs” by Robert Thurman, these spiritual practitioners work for “thecomplete welfare, liberty, and happiness of every living being.” Bodhisattvashave chosen to embrace Heaven as a practice, not a destination.Buddhists have a meditation practice they call tonglen, which is Tibetan for“taking and giving,” that offers a way to internally digest the toxins of theworld and use them to feed the wolf of love and peace that resides within all ofus. The practice involves visualization in which one person takes in thesuffering of others and releases into the world one’s own peace, love, andhappiness.Again, this suggestion has nothing to do with promoting Buddhism as areligion—even the Dalai Lama insists it’s a practice, not a religion. Spiritualpractice should be the most private and intimate of all matters rather thanself-proclaiming righteousness that always seems to come out asself-righteousness.Instead, consider the practice of loving thy neighbor as just one of the toolsin our do-it-yourself Messiah kit that apparently is as much a part of ourinheritance as is a perceived propensity toward evil. All that is required isthat we take the challenge to step away from the comfortable discomfort of beinga victim and graduate to the more productive discomfort of being a co-creator.In the remaining chapters of Spontaneous Evolution, we will look at thepractical matter of living in this ever-entangled physical world as we adopt theone suggestion as our new operating system. We will explore how economics canapproximate the cellular wisdom of the body and emulate the efficiency of Natureitself. We will see how political and social relationships reflect the ultimatetruth of the quantum Universe, which is that we’re all in this together. And wewill offer insight into how the universal field of compassionate wisdom can beaccessed in order to process and eliminate the toxic beliefs of domination,exploitation, fear, manipulation, injustice, and programmed ignorance that havebeen passed down to us through millennia.Finally, we will get a glimpse of a future, a time when we move beyond the oldstory and write new stories for ourselves, our children, and the world, a timewhen we see a worldwide spiritual authority that reflects the healthiest andmost coherent central voice of humanity, empowered as our own Iroquois forebearsforesaw by freedom at the grassroots.Are you ready to engage the one suggestion—that we are all one with the sameOne? If so, be prepared because all Heaven is about to break loose."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14A HEALTHY COMMONWEALTH“In Nature’s economy, the Golden Rule overrules the Rule of Gold.”— Swami Beyondananda The original draft of this chapter warned of a pending financial meltdown andthe potential for global economic collapse. In the fall of 2008, before themanuscript was completed, this negative potential exploded into reality as ourhouse-of-credit-cards economy, based on unlimited borrowing and a diluteddollar, began its precipitous collapse.While the financial crisis can understandably feel life-threatening, we willcome to see that it is a necessary adjustment, a convulsive labor pain that willpropel us to birth a higher evolutionary version of humanity—one that operateson the one suggestion that we’re all in this together.This chapter explores the exciting domain offered by a truly natural economy incontrast to the current economic structure that is based on outdated, irrelevantparadigms of only matter matters and survival of the fittest.But, to begin transforming our crisis into opportunity, some long-standing andunquestioned myth-perceptions about economics must first be set aright.Just hearing the word economics might cause brain fog for those who recall amystifying subject never fully grasped in high school or college. For others,the complexities of economics might be boiled down to the simple descriptionoffered by comic faux priest, Father Guido Sarducci, “You buy something forless—you sell it for more.”Aristotle first defined economics as the science of household management, thestudy of the dynamics necessary to sustain individual or family survival. Ashouseholds joined together in community to enhance their collective survival andprosperity, family economic principles were extended and applied to thewell-being of the entire village. Villages with successful economiessubsequently grew into cities and, later, evolved into more encompassingnation-states that employed essentially the same economic principles. Asnation-states further evolve into the new organism called global humanity, inwhich all must share the finite resources of one planet, it is again necessaryfor us to revise and expand our understanding of economics.Historically the field of economics has been associated with the dynamics ofproperty exchange among members of human communities. But in a fractal Universe,the same economic principles apply to all living systems, be they households,nations, businesses, or the communities of cells that comprise a human body.THE NATURAL ECONOMY: WHAT WOULD OUR CELLS DO?Over the last three millennia, human civilizations have periodically risen andfallen as their economic systems played out a repetitive pattern of growth,death, and renewal. Current global economic crises punctuate the ending ofanother cycle, another death, and it is painfully clear that civilization hasnot yet acquired an awareness of what constitutes a sustainable, stable economysuitable to serve as a basis for the next renewal.Fortunately, ancient wisdom and modern science conspire to point us toward thesolution of our economic woes. From the past, we receive enlightening insightfrom the old adage “The answers we seek lie within.” Paradoxically, the sameguidance comes from the new science of fractal geometry, which tells us that thefundamental elements of the eminently successful 50-trillion-celled communitythat is the human body can lead us to a successful human economy as well.The effectiveness of the cellular economy has stood the test of time in that ithas supported the survival of the human body for millions of years.Additionally, the body’s economy has proven to be durable and flexible enough tosupport human adaptation to the widest range of environmental challenges.Consequently, understanding economic exchanges among the body’s cellularcommunity will, logically, help us design a more successful model of humaneconomic management.At its most basic level, cellular economics is simply the study of how livingsystems apportion and use energy in order to work and produce. While the unitsof exchange may range from dollars to donuts, all economies are based on anexchange of work, which, of course, equates to energy.To maintain itself and empower its functions, a body expends energy as it worksto procure and process food, as we learned in Chapter 12, Time to See a GoodShrink. Cells, then, extract energy from that food and store it in the form ofstable ATP molecules, which is the cellular equivalent of money. ATP coins areexchanged among the community’s cells as salaries to cover the cost of expendedenergy for operations such as digestion, respiration, neural processing,movement, reproduction, and waste elimination.Energy produced in excess of the body’s needs, by definition, represents wealth.The body transforms surplus energy into energy-rich oil molecules that arebanked as fat deposits, which are the body’s equivalent of a financial savingsaccount. The body deposits and withdraws fat molecules to keep ATP moneycirculating and to fund the cellular community’s functions, growth, andmaintenance.A healthy economy can only exist when a community of individuals generateswealth by creating more energy than it consumes. For example, before a farmercan contribute to the village economy, he must first grow enough food to sustainhis own household. When he produces extra food, the farmer generates surplus,which, by definition, represents wealth. Circulation of the farmer’s wealthfacilitates production, consumption, and transfer of energy by and among otherswith various other skills within the village.Considering our culture’s preoccupation with the material realm, it is notsurprising that we measure wealth in terms of physical possessions, particularlymoney. Aristotle recognized an inevitable problem of equating money with wealthover 2500 years ago when he wrote, “He who is rich in coin may often be in wantof necessary food.” In other words, Aristotle understood that people who becomeavaricious and pursue money for the sake of merely having money confuse theinstrument of wealth—money—with wealth itself.So what is wealth, really? The term wealth is derived from the old English wordweal, which means “well-being.” In its original context, wealth literallyrepresents comfort, health, happiness, or satisfaction. The Founding Fatherswere clearly aware of the meaning of wealth when they penned in the Declarationof Independence that individuals “are endowed by their Creator with certainunalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit ofHappiness.”By contrasting the successful cellular economy with the failing global fiscaleconomy, we can identify four fundamental principles of economics in which humanpolicies profoundly differ from cellular practices. These deviations are inregard to our human perception of wealth and how it relates to well-being,ecology, efficiency, and currency stability.PRINCIPLE ONE: WEALTH IS WELL-BEINGIn his treatise on human economics, Aristotle wrote that a city originates forthe sake of basic survival, but it exists for the sake of living well. The sameconsideration holds true for the human body. The cellular community that is ourskin, bones, blood, and so on originated for the sake of the basic survival ofindividual cells, but it exists for the sake of the body’s entire well-being.A fundamental difference between successful cellular economics and the failinghuman economy concerns a polar opposite perception of the meaning of well-being.When cells assembled into communal life forms, the economic emphasis was not onthe wealth of the individuals but on the well-being of the collective,that is,the common, or shared, wealth of all.Even though America’s Founding Fathers valued individual freedom, theyunderstood that a healthy commonwealth—the governmental form in which power isheld by the people—would be essential if individual cells were to thrive.Unfortunately, after a century and a half of scientific materialism andDarwinism, the concept of commonwealth has fallen by the wayside, replaced bycompeting individuals seeking “uncommon wealth.”The wealth of a healthy economy is measured in terms of abundance, which is acommunity’s ability to produce in excess of its needs for survival. In a naturaleconomy, cellular communities possess wealth only after the basic needs of eachcellular citizen are met. Therefore, cells in one part of the body do not hoardenergy while cells in another part of the community are in need.Human economics completely misses the mark—it sins—in regard to this fundamentalprinciple of cellular economics. Our unnatural human economic policies aretainted by the Darwinian misperception that life is an eternal struggle forexistence. This aggressive notion emphasizes competition among individuals asthe primary driving force in evolution. When programmed into our beliefs, thismisperception encourages and condones selfishness at the expense of community.An economy driven by the survival of the fittest mentality honors individualslike Indian industrialist Lakshmi Mittal and Mexican telecommunications magnateCarlos Slim Helu, each of whom has amassed personal wealth of $50 billion while80 percent of the world’s population struggles to survive on less than $10 aday.1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en268]The current situation in human economics completely conflicts with thesuccessful cellular principle that the community’s first level of investment isto assure the health and social welfare of its citizens. Cellular logic is quitesimple: a healthy, happy population inevitably produces more wealth andprosperity for all because individuals consume less to survive. The consequenceof failing to make the community’s well-being a first priority seriouslythreatens human survival.Warfare, the health-care crisis, and the disproportionately large number ofimprisoned citizens are expressions of civilization’s lack of well-being. Theloss of productivity due to a disabled workforce combined with massiveexpenditures to fund the war machine, tend the ill, and control the incarceratedhas drastically drained America’s wealth.Our economic collapse is further exacerbated by a cultural program that equateswell-being with economic prosperity and self-worth with net worth. Suchbehavioral conditioning unconsciously drives us to acquire more stuff as a meansof ensuring happiness and life satisfaction.The validity of this programming has been profoundly challenged by thesurprising results of a 2003 World Value Survey of people in 65 nations,published in the British magazine New Scientist. The data revealed that PuertoRico and Mexico, although economically deprived, were the world’s happiestcountries, populated by the world’s most satisfied citizens. The proudlyprosperous Americans scored an embarrassing 16th on the list! Clearly, economicprosperity does not directly translate into well-being. 2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en269]One factor shared by all the happiest nations in the survey is a strong sense ofcommunity, a true representation of what is meant by commonwealth. Furthermore,research suggests that when an individual’s basic needs for security, safety,and health are met, their happiness and satisfaction with life is mostsignificantly impacted by the quality of their personal relationships—withthemselves, their partner, family, friends, and community.The survey data was bad news for consumption-oriented Westerners because itrevealed that consumerism, instead of facilitating the pursuit of happiness,might actually be chasing happiness away. Prosperity-driven cultures are workinglonger hours than ever before to earn enough to buy the stuff they think theyneed to make themselves happy. In the process, they become so busy chasing moneythey don’t have the time to invest in the personal relationships that actuallygenerate well-being.PRINCIPLE TWO: ECOLOGY AND ECONOMY ARE THE SAMEFor the past 1200 years, Western civilization has been conditioned to believethat humans are separate and distinct from the environment in which they live.That’s because, according to the perceived truths offered by the previousmonotheistic paradigm, humans arrived on this planet in a separate act of Divineintervention after the creation of all animals and plants.When scientific materialism commandeered civilization’s basal paradigm,Darwinism offered a completely different story of origins but with essentiallythe same conclusion: we arrived on the planet for no other reason than sheeraccident, the result of an improbable lineage of random mutations.The distorted perceptions of origins promulgated by both monotheistic creationand scientific evolution imply that human beings exist separate from theenvironment in which they are immersed. While monotheism teaches that mankindwas given dominion over the biosphere, scientific materialism contributes to ourseparation from the environment by suggesting that the mission of science is togovern and control Nature.Our misperceived detachment from the environment introduced life-threateningflaws into the way we manage our economy. Specifically, we have failed toacknowledge the reality that the environment is the primary source of wealth.Our monetary wealth originates from the sun’s energy, which fuels the growth ofall life in our biosphere. Our further monetary wealth comes from the finiteresources of Earth and through processes that lie outside the human economicmarketplace and are not funded by, or considered part of, the human economy.In the words of scientist-turned-economist Frederick Soddy, “Chlorophyll was theoriginal capitalist.”3 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en270] Chlorophyllmolecules are responsible for photosynthesis, the process through which thesun’s energy transforms water and carbon dioxide into nutritional sugarmolecules. Plant cells harvest their solar-powered sugar molecules and use themfor both metabolic building blocks and life-sustaining energy.The growth of a cornstalk, from a sprout to the height of an elephant’s eye, ismade possible by the accumulated nutritional wealth manufactured by the plant’schlorophyll. Almost all life on this planet, including our own, is dependentupon photosynthesis-created sugar molecules.Economists Carl H. Wilken and Charles Walters demonstrated how all wealth entersan economy as raw materials provided by Nature. Wilken declared, “All new wealthcomes from the soil.”4 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en271] Whether fruiton trees, berries on bushes, crops in fields, animals raised or in the wild, orminerals from the earth, everything of tangible value can be found on, in, orcoming from the ground. Even in today’s cyber economy, without the production ofgoods from the soil, life would perish.Charles Walters offers a powerful example of how Nature produces wealth in hisbook Unforgiven. Imagine one spring you place a kernel of corn in the ground.With proper sun and rainfall, in a few months the resulting corn plant willyield several ears of corn, each bearing hundreds of kernels with the samepotential to produce. Where else can one multiply wealth a thousand times insuch a short period? The environment is truly a cornucopia of ever-producingwealth.5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en272]Walters, whose magazine, Acres, serves the dwindling population of smallfarmers, has seen in his lifetime, the virtual disappearance of family farms. Intheir place, more and more factory farms operate monoculturally outside therhythms of Nature, producing de-natured food and toxic waste. Meanwhile, scienceand technology have given civilization the opportunity to wantonly mine Gaia’swealth in order to support the excesses of the human monetary economy.However, our ignorance of the planet’s fragile web of life has blinded us to theprofound damage and havoc we wreak by pillaging the environment’s resources andthen, adding insult to injury, contaminating that environment with discardedwaste.The wealth of the ecosphere, like that of any living organism, is a directreflection of its health. Decimated rain forests, festering open-pit mines,species harvested to extinction, toxic smog, pharmaceutically poisonedwaterways, discarded radioactive waste, and many other man-made catastropheshave compromised the environment’s well-being and devalued its ability toproduce health and wealth. Our misperceived efforts to dominate and controlNature have unwittingly disturbed the ecosphere’s natural balance andexacerbated environmental crises that now threaten our survival.In the holistic paradigm we are now moving into, we can no longer separate themoney game that we call economics from that game’s planetary consequences,especially when those consequences disrupt and threaten the natural environment.Nature provides human society with a diversity of life-sustaining benefits thateconomists would classify as goods and services. The basic goods are food forsustenance and building materials for shelter. The services are waterpurification, storage, and delivery; waste assimilation; balance of atmosphericoxygen and carbon dioxide; and regulation of climatic forces, to name a few.Environmentally provided goods and services are collectively referred to asecosystem services. And, whether you want to believe it or not, humanity’swell-being is totally dependent on the continued flow of Nature’s ecosystemservices.The cost of producing environmentally derived goods and services are borne byMother Earth. If we actually had to pay for ecosystem services, the costs forcommodities would be immensely higher. But, because the costs of environmentallyproduced goods and services are not factored into the global pricing system,renewable ecosystem services are often given little consideration when makingeconomic policy decisions.Whether we like it or not, global crises are now forcing us to give Nature’scontributions adequate weight in our economic decision-making processes.Humanity is beginning to realize that neglecting the role of ecosystem servicesmay ultimately compromise the sustainability of human life itself.In 1997, the journal Nature published an extensive study that incorporated thework of biologists, climatologists, economists, and ecologists from universitiesacross the United States. This study attempted to do what no one had donebefore—put an actual price tag on the natural world’s contribution to oureconomy. From a survey of 17 fundamental ecosystem services, the group estimatedthat the current monetary value of the environment’s contribution to our welfareconservatively comes to $33 trillion dollars per year. This startling massivefigure is about twice the gross national product (GNP) of the entire worldeconomy. To determine this astronomical figure, the study attempted to calculatethe financial contribution made by ten sub-ecosystems, from oceans to forests towetlands to deserts, and, yes, even urban environments. The value of thesesystems was based on the natural services that we take for granted as part oflife—what the ecosystem does to clean our air, supply and distribute our water,produce our food, and provide us with natural recreation.6[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en273]Because all economies on Earth would crash without the services provided byecological life-support systems, the environment’s actual value to the economyis infinite. Or, to paraphrase a popular credit card advertisement: Biospherelife-support systems, $33 trillion; Nature’s contributions to existence,priceless.The establishment of a monetary value for ecological services provides aneye-opening factor when calculating the value of ecosystem services lost versuspotential project gains.To provide for a sustainable economy, civilization is being called upon to walkin the footsteps of our animistic ancestors and honor Mother Earth by tendingher Garden. Our survival necessitates that we employ economic strategies thatfactor in the environment’s substantial contributions and, consequently, fundremediation and preservation measures that enhance the wealth and well-being ofboth Nature and human civilization.PRINCIPLE THREE: EFFICIENCY IS THE KEY TO THRIVALLiving systems, from cells to the humans and living entities they create, mustsuccessfully manage their energy economy in order to sustain survival andultimately prosper. To paraphrase Father Sarducci, an organism’s wealth is basedon its ability to generate more energy than it uses.As emphasized in our Survival Index in Chapter 12, Time to See a Good Shrink,the success of any organism—and this includes humanity—is predicated on howefficiently it utilizes energy resources. For persons conditioned to believethat environmental resources are limitless, the notion of efficiency, for allpractical purposes, is irrelevant—there’s always more, or so they say. In therule-of-gold economy, which is empowered by the current materialistic paradigm,populations have found it totally acceptable to extract and spend irreplaceablenatural wealth and define that practice as economic success. This self-servingshortsightedness has unhinged our economic system from the natural world thatsustains it.Because we are part of Gaia, the living Earth, we are accountable for everythingwe extract from the planet and release into the biosphere. For millennia, thisresponsibility was not well-understood because our little ol’ species couldn’textract or excrete enough to make a difference in this big ol’ world.All that has changed. According to a 2006 report by the World Wildlife Fund andthe Global Footprint Network, humans are devouring Nature at an “unprecedentedrate.” If the present trend continues, by the year 2050 we will need the naturalresources of two Earths to sustain our survival. WWF Director General JamesLeape added, “If everyone around the world lived as those in America, we wouldneed five planets to support us.”7 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en274]The natural limit to this unnatural growth comes when an organism finds that ithas devoured all its available food. The scientific term for this situation isextinction.Human beings are the most wasteful organisms on the planet. In contrast tosanely pursuing a more harmonious relationship with the environment,profit-driven corporations actually encourage greater inefficiency as a boon totheir own short-term profits. Consider, for example, the pirates of thepetroleum industry who plunder Nature’s oil reserves while simultaneouslycoercing automakers to manufacture bigger gas-guzzling SUVs—good for profits,bad for life.On the other hand, we can diminish or even balance our debt through thedevelopment of technologies that enhance efficiency. We have only to think backto our lives before the days of computers, the Internet, cell phones, andanswering machines to see how technology has improved efficiency in theworkplace while making a less-demanding demand on the environment.A fundamental drive behind the creation of community is to promote well-being,or what the Founding Fathers identified as “the pursuit of Happiness.” Incontrast to that beneficent concept and to support their own well-being at theexpense of the rest of the world, corporate interests have programmed the publicto believe that life satisfaction depends on possession and accumulation ofmaterial wealth. All we really need to be happy is a Ferrari, a Rolex, and adiamond-studded, 18 karat gold beer can opener. None of these, in themselves,represents, let alone ensures, being well. And if you spend your money to buythem, you’re not likely to be wealthy, either.As the ads exhorted, “What better way to show you love her than to buy a diamondring?” In the end, we will find that writing love letters or poems may be moreheartfelt and life-sustaining than a diamond ring that, on a simple, functionallevel, is primarily useful only for cutting glass or playing old phonographrecords.Maybe what we are after isn’t so much the goods, but the goodness we think thesethings will provide. Once we acquire this awareness, the most efficient economywill be one that provides the greatest happiness and well-being bang for theenergy buck.PRINCIPLE FOUR: CURRENCY MUST REPRESENT REAL WEALTHEver since life evolved on this planet, organisms have had to sustain theirexistence by working and investing their energy to empower behaviors thatproduce more life-sustaining energy. Once communities became large enough for adivision of labor, it became necessary to develop a system of exchange so thatan individual could acquire goods and services that were created through theenergy investments of other individuals in the community.Necessity is the mother of invention, and, in this case, the invention wasmoney. Money, or currency, is any instrument that is used as payment for goodsand services and the repayment of debts. Money is defined by three functions: itis a medium of exchange, it represents units of account, and it is a store ofvalue.Let’s compare that definition with ATP molecules, which is, as you know, theenergy-storing currency exchanged among cells within a living organism. In doingso, we will see that ATP molecules are the planet’s first currency, and theyprovide all three functions that characterize money.Function 1, Medium of Exchange: ATP is a medium of exchange that can betransported across both space and time. Both cash and ATP units are exchangeableand help us avoid the inefficiencies inherent in a barter system, whetherinternally or within society. Consider the difficulties when only goods areexchanged: Today’s Special: “Oil Change and Tune-up—Only Three Chickens and Halfa Trout!” Or, “I’ll trade you three fat molecules in exchange for eightdigestive enzymes.”Function 2, Units of Account: Each ATP molecule represents a defined amount ofconsumable energy. Consequently, ATP is a unit of account because it is astandard numerical unit of measurement that can be applied to the market valueof goods, services, and other transactions. Units of account simplify theexchange process: Oil Change: “15 ATP. Tune-up: 35 ATP. Today’s Special: Save10% on Both—Only 45 ATP.”This is easier than figuring the standard numerical value for half a trout.Function 3, Store of Value: ATP is also a store of value, which means it’s acommodity or form of currency that can be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved,and, upon retrieval, it is predictably useful. The energy value of an ATPmolecule stored for a million years is exactly the same today as it was whenfirst created. In contrast, the dollar, franc, euro, and yen change value almostevery minute.ATP represents commodity money, which is a currency based on the value of thecommodity out of which it is made. In contrast, the principal currency in humancivilization is representative money, which is currency that stands in directand fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself beingcomposed of that commodity. An example of representative money is the U.S.dollars that, at one time, were known as silver certificates because theyrepresented a dollar’s worth of silver, even though the notes were made out ofpaper.Today, the U.S. dollar, like most currencies, is fiat money, which is a form ofpaper or coin currency whose value is determined by a government order, a fiat.The usefulness of fiat money comes not from any natural value or guarantee thatit can be converted into silver, gold, or other precious metal, but is derivedfrom a legal decree that it must be accepted as a means of payment.In most countries, fiat currency is no longer backed by silver or gold and hasbecome a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value. If you doubt this, tryeating your money. While it might be high in fiber, it is very low innutritional content. And, even more amazing—a hundred dollar bill has no morenutritional value than a one dollar bill!Thomas Jefferson expressed concern regarding the value of representative moneywhen he wrote: “Paper is poverty, . . . it is only the ghost of money, and notmoney itself.”8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en275] Jefferson recognizedthat the nation would face an ill fate if it used representative money becausethey who issue that money, and they alone, would control its availability anddetermine its value.It is important to remember here that the colonial script we referred to inChapter 9, Dysfunction at the Junction, was, indeed, paper money, and that thisfiat currency—intrinsically worthless—was nonetheless an important key to thecolonies’ prosperity. Why is that? While it didn’t have the backing of silver orgold, it had something ultimately more valuable than precious metals; it had thegenuine value of the natural goods and productive services the American colonieswere ready, willing, and able to produce. To understand the difference betweenthis natural prosperity and the economic situation we are in today, we have tofollow the money.FOLLOW THE MONEYSo, where does money—be it in dollars, pounds, francs, or euros—come from? Why,from the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, andthe European Central Bank, respectively. The titles of these money-issuingentities sound very impressive and give the notion they are governmentinstitutions whose mission is the well-being of the commonwealth. Not so. Eachof these banks is a privately held corporation imbued with the primary corporatemission to make a profit for its fortunate shareholders!To understand how a bank brings money into existence, consider what happens whenyou go to a bank for a loan. Perhaps you think the money you borrow is anotherperson’s savings, invested in the bank to earn interest. That is not the case atall. Money-issuing banks operate on a fractional reserve system, which meansthey can print a quantity of bank notes equal to nine times the value of theircustomers’ deposits. They literally create 90 percent of the money out of thinair!How do privately owned banks fulfill their corporate mission to make a profit?They loan money for which they charge interest—10 percent interest equals 10percent profit.So, let’s say you borrow $1,000, the privilege for which you must repay the bank$1,100. Where do you get the extra $100? Well, from selling your goods orservices to other people. True—but where do they get the money to pay you? Oh,yes—they borrow from the same bank, which, of course, charges them interest,too.Let’s say a country has a population of one million people and each citizenborrows $1,000 from the bank to create an economy based on currency exchange.Collectively, the bank loans the country $1 billion in bank notes. In return,the country owes the bank $1 billion dollars for the loan’s principal, plusanother $100 million for the interest. So where does the country get the extra$100 million in currency to pay the bank? It doesn’t. It can’t.That’s because the country can only borrow and repay money—not create it—andbecause only banks can create money.This issuing of a national currency solely by private banks results in adebt-based economy in which there is never enough money in circulation to payboth the principal and the interest. It’s only through continual economicgrowth—and the demand for new loans—that enough money can be created to repaythe original loan. In other words, borrowing can only beget more borrowing.Inevitably, the compounding of the debt leads to a situation in which creditorinsolvency motivates banks to foreclose on loans. The debtor’s property, used ascollateral for the loan, is confiscated and distributed to the bank’sshareholders. Because the money loaned by the bank was never equal to the valueof the collateral, the shareholders happily accept foreclosures.This persistent pattern in the money game can be traced back to ancient Babylon.Centuries before Jesus cast the moneychangers from the temple, the priests ofBaal had their own money racket. Each spring, they would extend credit tofarmers to plant their crops. At harvest time, the priests expected payment.However, because the priests also regulated the money supply, they made surethere was never enough money in circulation for all the farmers to repay theirloans.9 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en276] This led to more credit beingextended, which meant that, at the next harvest, the debt was even greater.Repeating the same game plan over a number of years inevitably led to thefarmers becoming indentured servants to the priests, who produced nothing. TheBabylonian civilization eventually collapsed when the productive elements oftheir society were reduced to little more than slaves.Visionary economist Richard Kotlarz recognized that the same pattern ofexploitation, that is, “borrowing money into circulation, then withholding moremoney to make debt service impossible,” reverberated throughout ancientsocieties of Persia, Greece, and Rome with the same effect.10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en277] The practice later found resurgencein the era of colonialism and empire. It can be seen today in the monetarypolicies of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and otherinternational financial institutions. Their economic hit men of theglobalization era hit on underdeveloped nations, promising freedom throughcredit for development but delivering slavery through debt. The consequence ofsuch exploitive economies is that they always end up killing the proverbialgolden goose from which the tangible value originated.We see the same sad scenario being played out today as executives with goldenparachutes bail out of once-productive, but now indebted companies, closingfactories and leaving workers unemployed. Even though real wealth—the productivepotential of available resources and willing workers—is in place, the means ofexchange, the currency, has been extracted from the system. There isn’t enoughmoney available to purchase goods or pay workers for their services.No wonder visionaries like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison fought against theestablishment of a national bank in the United States. They understood thatpolitical freedom was not possible under a system of economic exploitation.Without the ability to coin debt-free currency based on the value of naturalwealth, an entire society would eventually fall into the perpetual in-debtstatus of those farmers in ancient Babylon.Jefferson was quite prophetic when he wrote: “If the American people ever allowthe banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation, andthen by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them willdeprive the people of all property, until their children wake up homeless on thecontinent their fathers conquered. The issuing power of money should be takenfrom banks and restored to Congress and the people to whom it belongs. Isincerely believe the banking institutions having the issuing power of money,are more dangerous to liberty than standing armies.”11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en278]As the current economic crisis reveals, the amount of money in circulationdoesn’t necessarily represent the wealth of a society. For example, considerthat America’s farm production during the Depression in 1933 was roughly thesame as it was in 1929 before the stock market crash. And, yet, the monetaryvalue of total farm income in 1933 was half of what it had been four yearsearlier! As economist Carl H. Wilken points out, the harvest of 1933 had thesame number of calories as the harvest four years earlier. If our currency wastruly a store of value, the value of farm production would not have been reducedby half.12 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en279]The variable nature of our money’s value has profoundly undermined our naturaleconomy and given rise to a totally unnatural one. David Korten, author ofAgenda for a New Economy, bluntly described our current financial system as a“money game in which the players use money to make money for people who havemoney, without producing anything of value.”13[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en280]Citing Kevin Phillips book, Bad Money, Korten compares the economy of America atits peak of global power in 1950 with the economy today. In 1950, manufacturingaccounted for 29.3 percent of the United States gross domestic product (GDP). By2005, manufacturing was down to a mere 12 percent, while so-called financialservices, meaning money invested into money markets, accounted for more than 20percent of the GDP.14 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en281]Hedge funds, an example of a financial service that was barely a shrub on theeconomic landscape 20 years ago, have now grown to over $1.8 trillion in assets.These risky ventures, which essentially use borrowed money to borrow more money,totaled some $14 trillion in 2006.15 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en282]The new word for borrowing is leverage, and the now defunct and discreditedLehman Brothers was leveraged 35 to one, meaning that it had borrowed $35 onevery dollar of its equity! Lehman’s bankruptcy has left its unsecured creditorswith over $200 billion in losses.16 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en283]In the world of money marketing, Wall Street’s short-term gain ends up as MainStreet’s long-term loss. Korten reported that, over a period of roughly threedecades, “the benefits of productivity gains in the Main Street economy werecaptured by Wall Street players as interest, dividends, and financial servicefees.”17 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en284]In an attempt to make ends meet in an economy where the real value of the dollarwas plummeting, the American consumer began to borrow money to pay for theirconsumable goods. Why, you can even use your credit card to purchase fast food,adding debt while you add calories. Financial institutions were all too willingto extend credit, and, by 2007, personal household mortgage and credit card debtstood at $13.8 trillion, which is roughly the equivalent of that year’s GDP!Time for another round of foreclosures!BEYOND THE OLD NEEDY-GREEDY: REAL MONEY BASED ON REAL WEALTHIn the sobering light of where we are today, it’s natural to ask who isresponsible for this sorry state of affairs. Do we blame the bankers, thecapitalists, the corporations, or politicians? Certainly, the money machinecalled the corporation bears some responsibility because corporations haveconveniently disconnected profits from the environmental cost of those profits.But, if we just identify one or two or three villains, we’ve missed the reallesson: essentially, we humans are collectively responsible for these conditionsbecause, time after time, we have agreed to them.This is particularly true in modern society where the poor dream of winning thelottery, the middle class uses credit to pay for instant gratification, and therich accumulate far more wealth than they will ever need.Thanks to survival of the fittest programming, the fear of not havingenough—which we call “scare-city”—is so pervasive that it’s difficult to imagineany other state of life. Programs of scarcity have compounded, like interest ondebt, as materialistic science and Darwinists gathered abundant historicalevidence that neediness and greediness are, so they say, part of human nature.Human civilization has been following the money for 3,000 years. What would itbe like to have money follow human life for a change? While we are at it, whatwould we like to have instead of the old needy-greedy? Fortunately, a largenumber of imaginal cell economists have come forward to help us see outside themoney matrix and design something new.As one example, Stephen Zarlenga of the American Monetary Institute has proposeda monetary reform platform that would likewise resonate with populistconservatives, libertarians, and America’s founders:18[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en285]1. End the private creation of money by the Federal Reserve Bank and replace itwith debt-free money that reflects the value of the general wealth of thenation.2. End the fractional reserve banking system and allow banks to make money bylending only money they have on hand.3. Add new money to the system, not as debt, but as national grants to rebuildthe infrastructure and thus create jobs that create real value.Zarlenga’s plan may sound radical, and it is. However, the situation we face isgrave, and, as with any emergency, everything is on the table. While we’reawakening to and dismantling our other no-longer-useful paradigms andprogramming, we might as well do the same with our obsolete beliefs about whatmoney is and what money does.As long as the discussion of making big changes is in the air, Richard Kotlarzsuggests we also reinstitute the Jubilee. In the Old Testament, every 50 yearsmarked a Jubilee Year when debts were forgiven and slaves freed. This was doneto make sure the fabric of society didn’t unravel due to vast discrepancies inwealth.A Jubilee today might create some much-needed jubilation. Without the burden ofdebt, imagine the worldwide potential for self-sufficiency, creativity, andgenuine, life-promoting enterprise. It is conceivable that we might actually beable to free up the resources to actually re-grow the Garden.In addition to long-term monetary reform, we can adopt three short-termstrategies that will bring about a healthier commonwealth: create and usealternative currencies, increase local self-sufficiency, and empower an economybased on growing happiness.Alternative Currencies: Valueless, debt-based representative money is a majorcontributor to the current global economic crisis. To paraphrase Einstein: Wecannot solve the economic problems with the same money that created them. A morefunctional currency must evolve before a sustainable economy can be established.Toward that end, creative economists are coming forward with revolutionary ideasregarding new units of exchange to transform the world’s current currencydilemma.In his book Access to Human Wealth: Money beyond Greed and Scarcity, BernardLietaer, a Belgian economist who helped design the euro, offers a short-termsolution for our economic problems in the form of yin currency. Yin currency isdesigned as a complement to the dominant money, yang currency, represented bythe dollar, the yen, the franc, the euro and so on.19[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en286]Lietaer emphasizes that the nature of what constitutes workable, beneficialmoney is defined by agreement within a community. Therefore, people are free tocreate their own currencies to complement the yang monetary system. Without evenrealizing it, we make use of complementary currencies all the time. Lietaercites frequent-flyer miles as an example of an agreed upon complementarycurrency—and you don’t even need to fly to earn them.Yin currency represents a form of money that allows time-rich but money-poorcommunities to contract needed services from those willing to provide them.Currently, nearly 4,000 communities around the world use yin currencies, mostoften as a means of funding nurturant care in communities where there isn’tenough yang money to pay for social services.A specific example of yin currency is Japanese fureai kippu, which means “caringrelationship ticket.” Instead of relying on expensive nursing homes, Japan hascreated the fureai kippu currency to pay for elderly care not covered bynational health insurance.20 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en287]Here’s how it works. Let’s say an elderly man who lives on your street cannot goshopping by himself. You do his shopping, help him prepare food, and assist himwith his ritual bath, which is an important part of Japanese culture. Inexchange, you earn credits that can be put in what might be termed a fureaikippu savings account. You can draw on your credits when you’re old, or you cantransfer them to your elderly mother who lives in another city so she can paysomeone else to look after her.Surveys indicate that Japanese seniors overwhelmingly prefer services providedthrough fureai kippu to those paid for in yen because they more closely expressthe heartfelt essence of community.Interestingly, the word community is derived from the Latin cum munere. Munereis “to give,” and cum means “among each other.” Community and fureai kippu sharethe same meaning—“to give among each other.”21[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en288]Another highly successful version of organic money is the Local Exchange TradingSystem, or LETS, developed by Australian James Taris. Much like other yincurrencies, LETS offers a clearinghouse for individuals within a community whowant to enhance the quality of their lives by exchanging caring services,skills, and talents. For example, it allows an auto mechanic or professionalbaby-sitter to enjoy a massage or a home-cooked gourmet dinner, things theycouldn’t afford in the dollar economy. As of this writing, there are currentlymore than 1,500 LETS and community currency groups in over 39 countries, anumber that will have surely increased by the time you read this!22[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en289]Local Self-Sufficiency: The buy-local movement represents another promisingnatural economic trend. No, this is not an anti-foreigner phenomenon. Rather, itrepresents the recognition of two cost-effective principles. First, locallyproduced products are economically and energetically more efficient simplybecause they eliminate transportation charges. Second, and equally important,locally owned endeavors add to the quality of life and uniqueness of an areawhile literally multiplying that area’s wealth.Two recent studies bear this out. The first study concerned four types ofbusinesses in San Francisco: books, sporting goods, toys and gifts, andlimited-service dining. The study’s results conclude that a mere 10 percentshift in retail spending from large chains to local stores resulted in nearly$192 million in increased economic output, $72 million in new income forworkers, and more than $15 million in new retail activity.23[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en290] A second study in Austin, Texas,concluded that if each household shifted $100 of holiday spending from chainstores to local merchants, it would have a $10 million positive impact on thelocal economy.24 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en291]How are these financial benefits possible? Big-box and chain stores take theirearnings out of the community. In contrast, locally owned businesses recirculatemoney close to home: they hire local labor, buy goods and services from regionalmerchants, support community charities, and spend their profits with neighboringstores.According to a study by the Go Local organization of Sonoma County, California,when purchases are made from locally owned businesses as opposed to nationalchains, the proceeds circulate three times longer in the community.25[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en292]To counter the daunting task of raising enough food for all 6.5 billion of us,the Go Local movement also has evolved a grow local branch that offers a simpleand natural solution. The goal is for every community to become sustainablethrough food and energy self-sufficiency. And, because the sun and soil are thesources of all wealth, then a healthy, wealthy commonwealth begins with everycommunity having access to this abundance.Even in the most urbanized and ghettoized areas of our country, food can begrown locally and provide a thriving business opportunity. When inner-cityresidents have access to vacant lots, rooftops, or a corner of a schoolyard orpark, they also acquire the possibility to grow, process, sell, and deliver foodup the economic food chain.Growing Happiness: To take the garden notion one step further, in a sense, eachneighborhood, community, city, state, and nation is a garden with the potentialto grow not only food but also other forms of renewable wealth, includingintangibles like happiness. Perhaps we need to follow the lead of the Buddhistkingdom of Bhutan, where, back in the 1970s, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck decidedthe true measure of wealth is Gross National Happiness (GNH).And what exactly is happiness? To the Bhutanese, it’s a change in perspective.“The underlying message,” according to an article in Developments Magazine, “isthat the country should not sacrifice elements important for people’s happinessto gain material development.” In short, GNH takes into account not only theflow of money but also access to health care, free time with family,conservation of natural resources and other non-economic factors.26[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en293]In keeping with the Buddhist idea that the ultimate purpose of life is innerhappiness, the Bhutanese society has decided to curtail the excessive use ofconsumer goods, essentially eliminating the corporate middle man, and cultivatethe greatest good of all—happiness. Bhutan’s lead begs the curious question:what if each nation, each region, and each community had a mission formaximizing happiness in the world, in its own unique way? Yes, what if?We cannot underestimate the economic impact of well-being intangibles like love,happiness, imagination, and awareness. In an evolving economy, these are themultipliers that help us achieve what Buckminster Fuller would have termed adymaxion economy, which means an economy based on “deriving maximum output froma minimum input of material and energy.”As we learned in the previous chapter, indices of well-being—love, happiness,peace, and equanimity—are contagious. For example, one person can walk into aroom with love, and hundreds or maybe thousands absorb that love and carry itout of the room with them. The love of the original bearer is not onlyundiminished but has, very likely, increased. If ever there was a formula forapplying the miracle of loaves and fishes, this is it!As with every other aspect of the newly emerging holistic paradigm, theresolution of our economic predicament will inevitably involve a global decisionmade by the collective. How are collective decisions made? And how reliable arethey? Are they made through some kind of Orwellian new world order in which wehumans become little more than pre-programmed voting machines? Or are they madethrough something far more intelligent in the collective conscious thatsimultaneously generates maximum freedom and maximum connection?The surprising answers to these questions, offered by modern science and fromAmerica’s founders, are discussed in next chapter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15HEALING THE BODY POLITIC“Imagine . . . going to the polling placesand being able to vote for the greater of twogoods.”— Swami Beyondananda Just as surely as our guardian beliefs about money and economics are up forre-examination and revision, our unconscious and unexamined beliefs aboutpolitics will also have to be transformed if we are to become the emergentorganism called humanity.To understand how fundamental the change in politics must be only requires atrip to the dictionary. Politics is commonly defined as “winning and holdingcontrol over a government” and “competition between special interest groups forpower and leadership . . . characterized by artful and often dishonestpractices.” In a world that believes in dueling dualities, competing interests,and every cell for itself, it’s understandable that the meaning of politicswould come to represent competition, control, and unsavory means toward selfishends.The consequences of such self-serving politics are destructive. In an articletitled “The Industrial System Isn’t Intended to Bring Out the Best in People,”environmental scientist Donella Meadows wrote: “Every day decent people clearcut forests, fish the oceans bare, spray toxins, bribe politicians, overchargethe government, take risks with the health of their workers or neighbors orcustomers, cheapen their products, pay people less than a living wage for aday’s work, and fire their friends. ‘If I don’t do it, my competitor will,’ theysay regretfully, and they’re right.”1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en294]That attitude exemplifies politics as a self-serving endeavor that, as we nowknow, has been shaped by Newtonian and Darwinian philosophy.But, delving deeper into the dictionary, we find a less common usage of the termthat aligns with our emerging holistic paradigm: “politics is the total complexof relations between people living in society.” With that definition, we can seethat our 50 trillion cells are a model community. And the wisdom of our cells tocreate harmonious politics within can be applied as new rules in the creation ofa healthy body politic in which we organize, relate, and act together.As we learned in Chapter 11 Fractal Evolution, and Chapter 12 Time to See a GoodShrink, cellular politics is characterized by:• Unity combined with diversity through which each of the body’s 200 differentcell types perform diverse functions for the benefit of the collective whole• A central intelligence system that coordinates all of the body’s physiologicsystems with the needs of individual cells• A healthy balance between beneficial growth systems and occasionally necessaryprotection systems, both of which consume energy resourcesThese principles of unity and diversity, central intelligence, and balancebetween growth and protection, as expressed within the body, can be applied tothe body politic to provide a new, more holistic definition: politics is how weorganize, relate, and act together to promote the health of the whole ofhumanity and every individual in it.And, by contrasting the social well-being of cellular politics with the crisesgenerated by dysfunctional forms of human political organizations, it is obviousthat a political evolution is in order.So, how do we evolve politically? To explore this question, we first considerthe obsolete and harmful consequences of Newtonian-Darwinian politics practicedtoday. Then we, once again, revisit the wisdom of America’s Founding Fathers whoset an example for a better way.NEWTONIAN-DARWINIAN POLITICSModern medicine as based on Newtonian-Darwinian philosophy, perceives the bodyas little more than a physical machine in which equal and opposite forces pushand pull against one another and every action provokes a reaction. When weencounter a symptom in our bodies that we don’t like, doctors simply mobilize anopposing pharmaceutical force to overwhelm it. Frequently, the counterforceunintentionally unleashes other forces that produce negative consequences knownas side effects.The mechanics of Newtonian-Darwinian politics operate in a similar way. If adisturbing symptom, such as an inconvenient uprising of economically deprivedpeasants or spiritually disenfranchised terrorists, occurs, the response is toapply a counterforce. And, if the force doesn’t work, then more force is added.Often, in combat, the counterforce unleashes negative consequences, or sideeffects, that are deceivingly listed as collateral damage, which means civiliancasualties, and the oxymoron friendly fire, which is the term for bullets andmortar that kill one’s own troops.The process of employing ever-escalating counterforces, followed to itsillogical end, assures mutual destruction. Perhaps the most hilarious—but notreally funny—representation of this behavioral absurdity and its inherentineffectiveness can be seen in a scene from a Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy filmin which the two hapless heroes get into a fender bender with another car. Inclassic Oliver Hardy fashion, he twiddles his tie and says to Stan, “Let mehandle this.” Ollie then steps out of his vehicle to confront the other driver.Starting with finger-pointing, one thing leads to another, and, eventually, theother driver yanks the mirror off Ollie’s car. In response, Ollie rips off theother car’s headlight. This is followed by the other driver pulling the fenderoff Ollie’s car. Every action provokes an escalated reaction until both driverssystematically and thoroughly dismantle each others’ vehicles.This scenario is now unfolding in the long-running non-comedy, The Iraqi HorrorPicture Show, which has played an extended engagement in the Middle East. It isthe story of every war in history, only more so. As horrible as wars have been,the increasing power to destroy combatants has had the side effect of causingmore and more civilian casualties.According to Norman Solomon, author of War Made Easy, civilians accounted for 15percent of the casualties in World War I, 65 percent in World War II, and, now,more than 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq.2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en295] If this trend continues, the only wayto assure personal safety will be to enlist in the military.Conventional political policy conforms to the machinelike nature of aNewtonian-Darwinian Universe—and a Laurel and Hardy comedy—and encourages cyclicaction-reaction responses to community disturbances. From a reductionistperspective, we tend to perceive each occurrence of civil unrest as a separateand unrelated event, merely the natural consequence of an eternal struggle tosurvive. But, in a holistic world in which we are all part of an interrelatedOneness, this is simply not true.Consider how the destructive policies of the U.S. government’s so-called war onterror would play out within the human body: Terrorist cells reported in theliver? Well, bomb the liver! They are too deeply entrenched? “Well, then, nukethe liver and radiate those terrorists! That’ll teach the liver to harborterrorist cells. Oh—the gall bladder and the pancreas are the liver’s allies,part of an axis of evil. Nuke them, too!” And so on, until every last radicalterrorist cell is dead. The unfortunate side effect of this strategy is that itwould kill 90 percent of the innocent civilian cells in the process and,essentially, destroy the body. How’s that for collateral damage?The Newtonian-Darwinian Universe emphasizes a mechanism of distinct independentphysical elements. In contrast, the quantum mechanical Universe demonstratesthat everything is connected and that separation is an illusion.In a Newtonian-Darwinian Universe, a cancer is perceived as an enclave ofdeviant cells living irresponsibly among normal body cells. To fight a cancer,medical doctors employ nuclear radiation, a military-like shock-and-awe responsethat releases chemotherapeutic poisons into the general cellular population.And, in the character of the military, the conventional medical paradigmdismisses the fact that many innocent, healthy cells will become collateraldamage as an unavoidable side effect of these hostilities—this nuking ofradical, irresponsible cells.Because Western medicine equates the body with a machine, it is, therefore,concerned with dominating and controlling that machine. But Eastern medicinetakes a completely different approach. Ayurvedic and traditional Chinesemedicine see the body as a quantum holistic system. Rather than attacking acancer with the intention of killing it, Eastern medicine first attempts torestore natural balance and harmony to the body. When an individual’s internalenvironment is in a state of well-being, the biological terrain simply does notencourage nor support disease-producing disturbances.Had the United States responded to the attack on the World Trade Center by usingthe cellular approach of simultaneously isolating the sociopathogens whileencouraging greater health and harmony within the world environment, humanitymight have taken an evolutionary step forward.Following the lead of holistic practitioners, holistic politicians would havefirst tended to the several causes of the imbalance that inevitably precipitatedthe symptom—the attack. They would have regenerated harmony by dealing withgrievances before they could manifest as grievous, retaliatory anger.It is important to note that a symptom, whether in civil society or a cellularcivilization, is not the cause, but a consequence. Failure to appreciate thatdistinction is the inherent folly in modern politics and modern medicine, bothof which focus on eliminating, covering up, or masking the consequence whileignoring the cause. Reacting to the consequence without understanding the causeis the first step toward an inevitable escalation of continuousNewtonian-Darwinian, action-reaction responses.Terrorist violence is a symptom of a much deeper social problem. In the case ofThe Iraqi Horror Picture Show, Western civilization’s manipulation of andinterference with Middle Eastern culture has created a tremendous socialimbalance. The West’s imperialistic attitude that those people are living onthat sand above our oil has generated a deep sense of humiliation among Arabsand great disrespect for their invaders. The foolish attempt to eradicateterrorists has actually caused more terrorists and more terror, which is asituation that political leaders must address if there is to be a resolution.Regarding the two current hotspots, Iraq and Iran, the U.S. seems to besuffering from a self-serving case of political Alzheimer’s, convenientlyforgetting that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was responsible formanipulating politics and leadership in both countries. The CIA master-mindedthe regime change in Iraq in 1963 that brought Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Partyinto power while making him head of Iraq’s secret service.3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en296] The CIA literally put the fox in thehen house—until he was no longer an asset—then abetted President George W. Bushand his top aides who contrived an illegal invasion to fetch him out.Similarly, the CIA overthrew Iran’s popular and democratically elected ruler,Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, in 1953 and installed its own candidate,General Mohammad Fazlollah Zahedi, and reinstated the monarchy of Mohammad RezaPahlavi as the Shah of Iran.4 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en297]The Shah, who was pro-West, remained in power until 1979 when he was overthrownby a fed-up populace. The nerve of those Iranians to take back control of theirown country! But, in a Newtonian-Darwinian political world built on opposingforces and counterforces, it is not surprising that the new leader, SayyidRuhollah Musavi Khomeini, the Ayatollah, proved to be an equally onerouspolitical despot.In addition to destabilizing Iran, Iraq, and other Middle East nations, Westernpolitical self-interests have equally disrupted the social systems of CentralAmerica, South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. A century ofNewtonian-Darwinian, push-pull political polarities have created such globaltensions that civilization is now on the verge of a spontaneous combustion.Fortunately, in the light of emerging new awareness, we have an opportunity todissipate these political tensions and, instead, redirect their forces toward aspontaneous evolution. A major key to help us manifest a healthy order and abalanced body politic is embedded in America’s founding documents.THE AMERICAN EVOLUTIONARIES AND A NEWER WORLD ORDERAmerica’s founders, as evolutionaries, intuitively understood the animisticworldview—the beneficial relationship of the individual, the collective, and thefield—that new-edge science is beginning to realize and confirm. If we, asmembers of modern society, set aside the harmful practices ofNewtonian-Darwinian politics in favor of a newer form of those original NativeAmerican beliefs, we can continue the evolution engendered by the men and womenwho transformed 13 individual colonies into a Constitutional nation designed togenerate and safeguard the common good of all.Influenced by the enlightenment philosophy of John Locke and Jean-JacquesRousseau, the perennial wisdom of hermetic spiritual traditions, andinteractions with Native Americans, the deistic founders sought to live inharmony with Nature.Likewise, they perceived tyranny as an unnatural imbalance and, therefore,sought a positive political structure that ensured individual freedom along withthat of a healthy, thriving society. In America’s founding documents, theyspecifically emphasized four traits they believed were necessary to accomplishtheir goal: liberty, justice, truth, and equality.• Liberty: As deists, the Founding Fathers understood liberty to be the freewill of life that encourages growth and evolution. However, they also realizedthat, in order to sustain survival, liberty must be balanced with justice.• Justice: Justice balances liberty because it tempers domination and recognizeseach individual as free, equal, and worthy of fair treatment, a situation thatjustly secures the freedom of the whole. In short, justice is the Golden Rulecodified by law.• Truth: Truth preserves and nourishes justice both within the body and the bodypolitic. Just as immune cells must correctly read internal signals and properlydistinguish false threats from real danger, We the People, need clear, un-spuninformation to accurately assess global situations and make decisions that arelife-sustaining and not life-threatening.• Equality: Equality is the balance between each and all combined with thelasting change that emerges from a critical mass of enlightened individuals.Our forefathers recognized the value of the commons, an area within communitiesset aside for discussion in which the voice of each individual counts as much oras little as another’s and where wealth and status are not used to judge one’sworth. Through observation and participation in such discussions, they knew thatcreating a nation in which citizens respect each other as equals increases thechances that healthy individuals will voluntarily work together to benefit theentire commonwealth.America’s motto, e pluribus unum, “out of many, one,” serves as a reminder thatthe one is not created through top-down imposition or kingly whimsy in ahierarchy of power but, rather, from the coherent effort of healthy,cooperative, sovereign individuals. It is an organization that is voluntary, notcoercive.THE CENTRAL VOICE OF DEMOCRACY: UNCOMMON COMMON WISDOMJust as America’s founders understood the animistic worldview, as described inthe previous pages, they also believed in the power of free individuals to callforth a more coherent order. Today, more and more people are also recognizingthe combined benefits of greater individual freedom and common wisdom.Here are examples of how professionals, from journalists to software designers,from business executives and management consultants to therapists andfaithkeepers, are applying or documenting that philosophy and changing theworld’s perspective.American journalist James Surowiecki opens his book, The Wisdom of Crowds, withthe tale about British anthropologist Francis Galton, the founder of eugenics,the science of genetic defects and presumed undesirable inheritable traits. As ascientist who had spent his life measuring human capabilities, Galton hadconcluded that humans simply didn’t measure up. He found “the stupidity andwrongheadedness of many men and women being so great as to be scarcelycredible.”5 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en298]In 1906, the 84-year-old Galton was at an agricultural fair near his nativePlymouth, England, when he observed a weight-judging competition in whichindividuals placed wagers and guessed what would be the total weight of an oxafter it was slaughtered and dressed. While the bettors included butchers andfarmers, most were average citizens with no familiarity of the meat packingbusiness. Cynically, Galton described these people as a typical cross-section ofthe public who cast ballots in elections.He decided to conduct an investigation that he ostensibly believed would provethe incompetence of the average individual who seemed so incapable ofself-governance. After the contest was over, Galton assembled the 787 legibleentries, added the contestants’ estimates, and calculated the mean estimate,which was the average weight guessed by the crowd as a whole. Galton wascompletely surprised by the result. The average guessed weight was 1,197 pounds,only one pound less than the actual dressed weight of 1,198 pounds!While not even the individual whose ticket won the wager came that close toguessing the actual weight, there was something about the collective guesses ofaverage people that provided an awareness that not even an expert could match.Interpreting this phenomenon, Surowiecki suggests that each individual haslimited knowledge, but when “aggregated in the right way, our [collective]intelligence is often excellent.”6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en299]Just as certain statistics, when charted, tend to plot as a bell-shaped curve,we might reasonably imagine that, when the judgment and perspective of a largeenough sample of individuals are combined, their mean estimate would approximatethe real answer or the best possible solution to any given problem.Another example of mass common wisdom occurred during the aftermath of thetragic explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Because the launch wastelevised, people saw it as it happened and news of the disaster spreadinstantly. When reports of the accident hit the Dow Jones newswire, investorsimmediately began unloading stocks in the four companies responsible forbuilding the Challenger and its engines: Lockheed, Martin Marietta, Rockwell,and Morton Thiokol. But by the end of the day, all the companies’ stocks hadbegun to rebound except Morton Thiokol’s, which remained 12 percent down.7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en300]This market reaction indicates that traders sensed Morton Thiokol wasresponsible for the accident, even though no one really knew which company’spart had failed. Six months later, investigators of the crash determined thatfaulty O-ring seals on the booster rocket caused the Challenger disaster. MortonThiokol made those seals. How on Earth—or, how in space—did the investmentpublic intuit that result months before the experts released their findings?Surowiecki’s research led him to conclude that three factors influence theaccuracy of a crowd’s common wisdom: diversity, independence, anddecentralization.Diversity: In Newtonian-Darwinian thinking, the political atrocity of ethniccleansing is considered to be good because it rids a nation ofpersons—others—who might look different or disagree with our way of thinking.The same misperception applies to blackballing an individual from a group. Incontrast, the evolving holistic view realizes the benefit of diversity.In decision-making or problem-solving situations, the perspectives of a diversegroup offer more accuracy than a homogeneous group of specialists. That’sbecause people who are more intelligent or knowledgeable about a particularissue tend to think alike, whereas a group with a variety of perspectives willexhibit a broader range of wisdom.Surowiecki concluded, “Adding in a few people who know less, but have differentskills, actually improves a group’s performance.”8[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en301] In other words, a large group thatincludes individuals with different life experiences will generate more preciseforecasts and make more intelligent decisions than even those considered to beskilled decision makers.Independence: The second factor that influences crowd accuracy is independence.When groups talk among themselves, they tend to prematurely come to consensusand conform to a norm. Generally, however, agreement on what are perceived to benormalized responses does not imply that the conclusion is right, proper, orbeneficial. In situations where an individual or individuals have a higherstanding within a group, members of that group tend to follow the leader. Andthe more people in a group who conform to an opinion, the harder it becomes forthose with minority views to have their opinions considered.In contrast, consider the independent thinking of the people who guessed theweight of the ox. Individually, each offered an answer, secretly scribbled on apiece of paper, without conversation and without expert testimony from thosewho—apologizing in advance for a very bad pun—had some kind of ox to grind. Theresult was a common wisdom, generated by independent thought, collectivelystated through what was, in effect, a ballot process.Decentralization: Conventional thinking holds that ownership and control ofsolutions is good. This applies to businesses seeking greater profit or toindividuals desirous of higher status or praise on the job or recognition withintheir families or social groups. To that end, corporations, for example, oftensequester a group of in-house specialists to work on a specific problem, to theexclusion of external points of view. And individuals may retain secrets theybelieve will give them an edge.In contrast, decentralization demonstrates that collective problem solving isactually a better process for health and wealth of both the individual and thecommunity.All three of these factors—diversity, independence, and decentralization—arefound in the concept of shared awareness, which has inspired the profoundlyefficient and effective wiki Internet software that allows collaborative editingof Webpage content and structure by all members of a population. Thisfacilitates awareness and rapidly accelerates the learning curve for all. Thebest-known wiki Website is Wikipedia, the constantly expanding livingencyclopedia.In Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, Canadian businessexecutive Don Tapscott and consultant Anthony D. Williams described wikis as,“self-organizing, egalitarian communities of individuals who come togethervoluntarily to produce a shared outcome.”9[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en302] Thanks to the power of computers andthe reach of the World Wide Web, problems can now be exposed to the expertiseand wisdom of a whole world of independent minds.Tapscott and Williams tell the remarkable story of Goldcorp, a smallToronto-based gold mining company that defied precedent by making itsproprietary information public and offering $575,000 in prizes to those whocould best help them locate “the next 6 million ounces of gold.” This opensource strategy provided so much awareness that Goldcorp transformed from a $100million company to a business worth over $9 billion.10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en303]Surowiecki cites another wiki success in the story of Linux, the highlyproductive open source software system designed by Finnish software designerLinus Torvalds in 1991. Rather than holding on to the proprietary rights of hissystem, Torvalds revealed his code to the world and sought feedback forimprovements from all interested computer scientists. Almost immediately, hereceived suggestions from programmers around the world. Thanks to the commonwisdom offered by individuals working in their areas of interest, Linux hasbecome an ever-learning, growing, and increasingly robust system.11[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en304]Open source wisdom offered by wikis may, in fact, provide the key to solvingsociety’s most challenging problems that have, until now, been exacerbated bythe secrecy of a for-profit-first—rather than a for-the-good-of-all—mentality.What better way to think globally and act locally than to have ideas from oneplace tried elsewhere with both successes and failures reported for everyone tosee? After all, life itself is open source.How can open source systems influence our collective political wisdom? TomAtlee, founder of the Co-Intelligence Institute and author of The Tao ofDemocracy, confirmed and expanded on Surowiecki’s findings that the crowd tendsto be wiser than its wisest members. Atlee suggested that specific skills can becultivated that help extract wisdom from groups. Not surprisingly, these skillsinvite openness and suppress domination by an individual or an idea.Atlee cited an experiment reported by management consultant Marilyn Loden in herbook, Feminine Leadership. Small groups of executives were given a simulatedwilderness problem to solve. Teams comprised only of females arrived at bettersolutions than all-male teams, not because the women were smarter individuallybut because their natural collaborative style made them collectively smarter. Incontrast, male groups were hampered by individuals who asserted their ownsolutions and inhibited access to group wisdom.12[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en305]And what exactly is wisdom in regard to political situations and collectivedecision-making? Atlee defined it as “seeing beyond immediate appearances andacting with greater understanding to affirm the life and development of all.”13[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en306] Perspective offers wisdom. Therefore,communities have greater potential for wisdom than do individuals. “Communitiesare wise,” Atlee explained, “to the extent they use diversity well in acooperative, creative interplay of viewpoints that allows the wisest, mostcomprehensive and powerful truths to emerge.”14[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en307]Atlee said the tool to access wisdom is co-intelligence, which he defined as,“integrating the diverse gifts of all for the benefit of all.”15[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en308] Clearly, our body, our organs, andour cells are co-intelligent, a trait that enables them to co-evolve with theirenvironment. Likewise, when applied, co-intelligence enables ordinary people toaccess extraordinary wisdom through which we can, hopefully, practice evolutionand reach transcendent solutions.TRANSCENDENT SOLUTIONS: PRACTICING EVOLUTIONA primary function of politics is to develop policies that preempt conflict.Conflict is a natural part of human life and social interactions and should notbe confused with violence, which is the most dysfunctional way to handleconflict. Conflict derives from incompatibilities between two or more opinions,principles, or interests. Because conflict usually involves contradictory goals,resolution can occur when something—the goals or expectations regarding thosegoals—is changed.In the classic book on negotiation, Getting to Yes, authors Roger Fisher andWilliam Ury suggested that breakthroughs in conflicts come when positions aredeconstructed and transformed into expressions of legitimate interests. Oncedisagreeing parties clarify their interests, they can reframe the conflict as ashared problem and, thus, see each other as colleagues working together toresolve that problem.16 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en309]Careful and respectful listening by all participants is required for thisprocess to occur, continue, and be successful. When a party to the discussionmakes an emotional statement or raises an objection, it is an opportunity toask, “What is your concern?” The response may be rational or irrational, buteither way, it must be heard and recognized as an insight that could lead to akey breakthrough.The result of this process, whether resolving conflict or developing a policy topreempt conflict, is often an emergent solution that could not have beenpredicted at the start of the process. When a solution is sought at a higherlevel of consciousness than that which created the problem, it facilitatesaccess to this higher wisdom.Tom Atlee tells the story of an Indiana farmer who found his neighbor’s dogskilling his sheep. The too often way of solving such problems involvedconfrontation, threats, lawsuits, barbed wire fences, and, potentially,shotguns. This particular farmer had a better idea. He gave his neighbor’schildren lambs as pets. This out-of-the-box solution established a win-winproposition: for the sake of the children’s adorable pets, the neighborsvoluntarily tied up their dogs, and the families became friends.17[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en310]Johan Galtung, a Norwegian pioneer in peace and conflict resolution, made acareer of finding what he called the fifth way, or fivers. Galtung recognizedthat every conflict has five potential resolutions:1. I win. You lose.2. You win. I lose.3. Negative Transcendence in which the problem is solved by avoiding itentirely.4. Compromise in which each wins by agreeing to lose a little.5. Transcendence, which produces a resolution above and beyond the problem.Conventional politics seeks to resolve issues through compromise, which, atbest, leaves everyone equally dissatisfied. In contrast, the transcendent fiversolution generates a positive feeling among all parties. The first step inbringing forth a fiver is the intention between two opposing polarities not tomeet in the middle but to join forces and move forward together toward anoptimal solution.The power of Galtung’s fiver approach is exemplified in negotiations he mediatedover a 55-year-old border dispute between Peru and Ecuador. What was theemergent solution to a polarized border dispute? No border at all! Today, thecontested area is a thriving bi-national zone run by and for both countries, andit even includes a jointly administered nature park.18[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en311]This is holistic politics at its best because it involves the practice ofevolution, seeking emergent both-and solutions that are beyond the dualisticeither-or conflict.Atlee supports the power of pooled and cooperative experience. He acknowledgesthat, as a society, we “have reached the limits of an atomistic approach tocitizenship—in which individual perspectives simply add up when we agree, orcancel each other out when we do not.”19[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en312]A MISSING PERSONS REPORT ON WE THE PEOPLEThe current opposing-party system of politics is designed to manipulate publicopinion rather than cultivate public wisdom. As a result, the public usually hasto choose between two less-than-satisfying alternatives. If ever the worldneeded a fiver worldview, now is the time.So what is stopping us? Given the inherent wisdom of crowds, why does ourcollective political judgment, particularly recently, seem so flawed and soeasily manipulated?One answer is corporate media, which is the right-hand helper of the currentNewtonian-Darwinian political structure and is not the central voice ofdemocracy.In the current atmosphere of privatized falsehood masquerading as truth andintentional distortion to exploit and dominate the public, it’s easy to forgetthat the Founding Fathers didn’t design freedom of speech and freedom of pressso that we could utter George Carlin’s “seven words” on TV or get porn in ourinbox. The real reason for these freedoms is to ensure that sovereign citizenshave all the information, perspective, and viewpoints needed to effectivelyrespond to the issues of the day—so we can better come up with our collectivefivers.Another answer is the belief of some in cynical realism, which holds there is notruth. Adherents of this philosophy emphasize that “Life is a battle of allagainst all,” a belief that stems directly from Darwin’s survival of the fittestand is an example of Galtung’s Negative Transcendence, which, entirely andpessimistically, avoids the problem of truth or not truth.Meanwhile, even those addicted to mainstream news have a gnawing sense they arebeing lied to. Consequently, an undercurrent of cynicism—you can’t believeanything—creates another level of self-disempowerment. Because nothing seems tobe true, why bother to exercise discernment or integrity? Philosopher AldousHuxley offered an important insight on the negative consequence of this ideologywhen he wrote: “Cynical realism—it’s the intelligent man’s best excuse for doingnothing in an intolerable situation.”20[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en313]Thus, we see that the current political dysfunction is kept in place by our owndisempowering developmental programming and the politicians, corporations, andmedia moguls who benefit from that programming.While We the People could rightly be faulted for apathy, the truth is that theaverage adult is far busier nowadays than his or her counterpart half a centuryago. How ironic that back in the ‘50s, people imagined that by now we’d beliving a paradise, working a three-day week. In the United States today, theaverage family needs two breadwinners working full-time . . . to barely make it.Civic life? Who has time for it? Consequently, in the transition from town hallto global village, the resonant central voice of We the People has been drownedout by the massive media voice of we, the very, very select people.THE SYSTEM IS THE PROBLEMTo evolve the revolutionary vision of America’s Founding Fathers oneevolutionary step further, we must now wake up our minds and see the light ofour new awareness, the need for an intelligent central voice, and the inherentwisdom of the crowd.A key to that wake-up call comes from business consultant Jim Rough, author ofSociety’s Breakthrough! Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People.Rough uses a technique he named Dynamic Facilitation to replace mutual stucknesswith common wisdom. To demonstrate how to transcend the current politicalstructure, which is designed for battling, he asked an audience to select acontentious issue and assured them he would facilitate a resolution within 30minutes. The group chose the highly charged topic of abortion.At first, participants expressed the usual binary pro-life and pro-choicepositions that demand a divisive this-or-that resolution. Once all the either-orpositions had been stated and written on a board for all to see, Rough asked forother possible suggestions. A period of silence ensued as the group ponderedunfamiliar territory outside the box.Thus, Rough motivated them to look beyond the symptom, that is, abortion, andseek the cause of the dispute. At the end of 30 minutes, despite having voicedsharply different views, the group came to a breakthrough question that definedthe real problem: “How can we achieve a society where all children are conceivedand born into families who want and love them?” Rough stated, “This kind ofconsensus, a pulling together of what everyone thinks, can always be reached.”21[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en314]However, in order to truly understand the power of Rough’s process and how itcan transform politics in America and elsewhere, let’s begin with the universalconclusion arrived at in every one of his group sessions: the system is theproblem.This is not intended to slough off personal responsibility but, rather, toacknowledge that, in the absence of a coherent voice of We the People, aheartless, soulless, self-perpetuating system persists.In order to understand how America arrived at this position, let’s go back tothe radical notions of America’s Founding Fathers. While they believed thatgovernment must serve the people, the new government they created stopped shortof actually giving power to the people. Instead of a democracy, they actuallycreated a republic.The subtle, yet profound, distinction between these two terms can be traced totheir etymologic roots. The word democracy comes from the Greek demos, whichmeans “the people,” and kratia, which means “power.” And the word republic comesfrom the Latin res, which means “thing,” and publica, which means “of thepeople.” The distinction is that a democracy is ruled by the power of the peoplewhile, in a republic, people empower a thing to rule them.Participatory democracy is a government in which people govern directly, anddecisions, such as starting or ending a war or raising or lowering taxes,require a vote of the people. In subtle contrast, a republic is an indirectdemocracy in which decisions are made by the peoples’ elected representatives.In this manner, America’s founders carefully crafted a balance of power that notonly protects the many—We the People—from the few who would control but protectsthe few from the many who might transform into a rebellious mob.That is all well and good, but the problem today is that the system, as it hasevolved toward Newtonian-Darwinian thinking, no longer holds electedrepresentatives accountable. Consequently, they are no longer obligated togovern and vote on behalf of the people they were elected to represent, and theycan just as easily vote to further the interests of special interest groups, bigcorporations, or even themselves.This is why the Constitution, as it has been amended and interpreted over thedecades, no longer defines the country as being either a democracy or arepublic. Rather than ensuring that We the People govern through ourrepresentatives, it now allows our representatives to govern us and makedecisions detrimental to the common good.Fortunately, thanks to the instant global communication through the Internet,more functional ideas and individuals are coming to the fore and gatheringsupport.THE SHAPE OF POLITICS TO COME?At the beginning of this chapter, we posed the question: “So, how do we evolvepolitically?” To answer that, we compared Newtonian-Darwinian politics with thebeneficent formula of politics established by America’s Founding Fathers. Wealso showed a comparison between the intentions of the founders and the extentto which their intentions have devolved.Here’s another comparison that will help us answer that question and understandthe shape of politics to come.Jim Rough suggests that, throughout history, civilizations have employed someform of governance that can be depicted by geometric shapes: triangle, box, andcircle.22 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en315]Triangle: The first form of governance is top-down: rule by chiefs, kings, oremperors. Rough depicts this form of governance as a triangle, which representsdependence.As a form of leadership, the triangle is elementary, if not infantile. Just aschildren depend on parents for sustenance, order, and discipline, an uninformedpopulace depends on an appointed leader to do the same for them.This is the form of governance imposed by historical English kings and queens ontheir subjects and colonies around the world.Box: The second form of governance involves a set of rules and agreementscreated by the populace rather than the arbitrary rule of a top-down hierarchy.Rough depicts this form of governance as a box, which represents themetaphorical container into which the rules, such as the U.S. Constitution, areplaced and held sacred. This form of governance relies on the will of freepeople and therefore represents independence.Just as adolescents break loose from parental authority to explore their ownpower and resources, our Founding Fathers offered their fellow colonialists thewherewithal to be independent individuals, an offer that broke loose as theAmerican Revolution.While America’s founders offered a vast improvement over King George’s monarchy,their republic was still a thing. Yes, it was created by independent, sovereigncitizens and codified by the Constitution and the rule of justice, but it wasstill a machine that had no inherent moral authority. Like any machine, it couldbe used for purposes dictated by those who sit in the driver’s seat. Over thelast two centuries, We the People have gotten so far away from the actualdriver’s seat that we are now hostages in the back seat, if not locked in thetrunk. The thing that the people created is being driven by the self interestsof those who perceive themselves as the politically fittest in the struggle forsurvival.More distressing is the fact that the machine called government is now beingruled by itself to perpetuate itself. This situation is eerily similar to thatin Stanley Kubrick’s movie 2001: A Space Odyssey in which the spaceship’son-board computer, HAL, takes over control of the ship and locks out the crew topursue its own machine-like interests. Our own box-like creation, a self-servingand self-perpetuating unaccountable government has likewise locked out anddisenfranchised the American public. Things feel so out of control because theintrinsic moral values of 95 percent of Americans have been overridden by thesociopathic values of a mere 5 percent of the population. Two hundred years agowhen the founders were designing this government, their fear was mob rule.Thanks to the absence of the central voice, the new threat is mobster rule.Circle: Fortunately, there is a third shape of governance—a circle—that canenable our species to achieve “humanifest destiny.” Every point on a circle isequidistant from the center and is equally important to maintain the shape ofthe circle. Therefore, the circle represents interdependence. Not to be confusedwith co-dependence, interdependence means a community of capable, diverse, andco-equal individuals who recognize that self-interest and mutual interest areone and the same.And, while both James Surowiecki and Jim Rough view independence as somethinggood to be appreciated, we must also recognize it as merely a necessary steppingstone on our path of evolution that has led us from the triangle’s politicalchildhood to the box’s political adolescence and is now leading us to the circleof political adulthood.The power of the circle as an access point to a field of higher wisdom was firstrecognized by Earth’s indigenous people. Oren Lyons, faithkeeper of the TurtleClan of the Onondaga Iroquois, described tribal council sessions during whicheveryone sits in a circle this way, “We meet and just keep talking until there’snothing left but the obvious truth.”23[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en316]A Native American elder, storyteller, and author named Manitonquat, whose namemeans Medicine Story, uses the same circle to turn around the lives of hardenedcriminals. Manitonquat runs a highly successful program in New England prisons.He wrote: “Our people noticed long ago that the circle is the basic form ofCreation. In the circle, all are equal; there is no top or bottom, first orlast, better or worse.”24 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en317]Manitonquat stated that the golden key in this process is respect. He said,“Most of these prisoners have never in their lives been listened to withrespect. Very few have persons in their experience who have shown them respectin any manner at all.”To ensure respect, Manitonquat employs a talking stick, held by the personspeaking, to empower and liberate that person to speak freely and to remindothers in the circle to listen intently. He tells prisoners, “No one was everlike you in all of the universe, and there will never be another one like youagain. Therefore, only you have your special gift, and you are the only one whocan give it away . . . the rest of us need to receive your gift and hear yourstory.”25 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en318]Only 5 to 10 percent of convicts who complete Manitonquat’s program ever returnto prison as compared to a recidivism rate of 65 to 85 percent for the generalprison population. This wildly effective rehabilitation program is amazinglyinexpensive. As a volunteer, Manitonquat serves 120 to 150 inmates in sevenstate prisons for only $100 a month in travel expenses.Many convicts who complete the program return to their home neighborhoods withthe desire to, as Manitonquat described, “replace the pyramid of domination withthe circle of equality and respect.”26[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en319]Box in Circle: The next evolutionary form of governance may be represented by abox within a circle. Under this visionary plan, inside-the-box governmentalparadigms would still hold elections and make and enforce laws. However, thebox, which contains our Constitutional independence, would exist inside theinterdependent circle of We the People.To encircle the box of government with collective wisdom and co-intelligence,Tom Atlee, Jim Rough and others propose citizen deliberative councils or citizenwisdom councils. These or similarly named groups of randomly selected personsfocus on issues and policies that are mired in conflict then glean common wisdomand make it available to the entire community or nation.These councils are holistic in two ways: First, they seek input from thebroadest range of information and points of view, even ideas that seem outsidethe box. Second, they seek solutions that address the well-being of the wholeversus that of special interest groups. In contrast to the static positions thattypify binary politics where one party is pitted against another, citizendeliberative councils offer dynamic, emergent solutions.One example occurred in 1997 when 15 citizens who represented Boston’s diversepopulation convened to consider that city’s telecommunications policies. Thegroup’s membership included a high-tech business manager, a homeless person, andpeople of various other social and financial strata. The group spent twoweekends becoming familiar with the issues and, then, two days listening toexpert testimony.After deliberating, they came up with an impressive consensus statement, whichthey presented to the public. Even though none of these individuals wereexperts—or, perhaps, because of that fact—they were able to process thetestimony into workable policy. Dick Sclove, the lead organizer, reported that,by the end of the process, these average citizens knew more abouttelecommunications issues than their elected representatives who vote on them.27[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en320]Jim Rough says that wisdom councils that employ the principles of DynamicFacilitation can provide “a nonjudgmental, heartfelt, energy-driven creativethinking process in which people seek to invent new options that work foreveryone. Instead of negotiating agreement on particular points or discussingideas back and forth, people seek breakthroughs everyone can support.”28[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en321]While such councils have the inferred power of moral authority and couldrecommend new solutions to the public, they do not possess coercive powersassociated with the authority to pass legislation. Yet, Tom Atlee reports thatcitizen deliberative councils have been used by the Canadian government and bythe Danish Parliament to generate recommendations for legislation and newpolicy.29 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en322]Regardless of the level of government or community in which they are used, suchcouncils and their evolutionary principles offer society a vision of what ahealed body politic might look like. And with that vision, we will hopefully seethat new form of governance, the box that is the rule of law inside thecircular, coherent, central voice of We the People.Then, the next questions become: How do we get there from here? How do we bringmistrustful and long-separated parties together? How do we lift ourselves fromthe habits of separation, mistrust, hatred, and retribution? And what is the neworganizing principle for the body politic?HEARTLAND SECURITYIn the final chapters of the book, and particularly this chapter, we have usedour cellular community to reflect on the body politic. However, there is onebody part that we have not yet addressed in Part III, and it is now time for thediscussion to get to the heart of the matter—or, more accurately, the matter ofthe heart.We have seen how a body politic that has lost connection with its heart and soulcan lose its way. To emerge a new political order in which each individual isviewed as an equally valuable cell in the body of humanity involves shifting ourfocus from a fear-based homeland security to a love-based heartland security.In her aptly titled book Waking the Global Heart: Humanity’s Rite of Passagefrom the Love of Power to the Power of Love, author and therapist Anodea Judithwrote that “the rite of passage into the future” is through an awakening of theglobal heart. If future generations are alive to tell the human story, “it willonly be because the best of humanity prevailed and pulled together with a loveso profound that the seemingly impossible was achieved.”30[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en323]The best of humanity to whom Judith refers isn’t some righteous elite but,rather, the potential that each of us holds within. Perhaps love—the invisibleforce that can induce a cancer cell to slow its growth—is humanity’s secretpeaceful force that will enable us to transcend survival and live into thrival.If so, it’s the most underutilized tool in our political toolbox and the oneripest for development. As discovered by HeartMath researchers, coherent heartsentrain with one another. Consequently, it is feasible that we can entrain ourhearts to collectively focus love energy into a coherent healing force.Indigenous cultures and medieval villages often had a communal hearth at thecenter of the village. Initially, the fire was used to keep predators away. Overtime, it came to represent the presence of spirit looking over the community. InWestern culture, where tending the spiritual fires has been left to religiousauthorities, people have become disconnected from their common spiritual bonds.The only time the masses experience a collective connection is when anextraordinary event occurs, such as a man walking on the moon, or when tragedystrikes, as in New York on September 11, 2001.What would it be like to have a preemptive secular, yet spiritual, connection inevery neighborhood, city, and nation to affirm the values that the vast majorityof people have in common?Such a network has been quietly evolving in Reno, Nevada. Launched in 2003, anorganization called the Conscious Community Network (CCN) brings togetherdiverse elements of the city and surrounding region to improve the communal,economic, and spiritual quality of life in the area. Without fanfare—but withlots of fans—CCN has based its work on what it called “the universal spiritualvirtues of Love, Integrity, Courage, Service, and Respect.”31[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en324]The CCN organization and its leadership mobilized local and state governments toestablish Independents Day, an awareness campaign to encourage the public to buylocal goods and services. They created a Local Food System Network of localproducers and consumers that birthed an alliance of persons with diversereligious beliefs who share a common desire for organic produce.By weaving together common sense traditional values with the globalunderstanding that we’re all in this together, the Conscious Community Networkcreated what is termed a third force, a political entity that more closelyresembles the circle than the conventional American political box. CCN’s worksupports transpartisanship, which acknowledges the validity of truths across arange of political perspectives and seeks to synthesize them into an inclusive,practical unity outside of conventional political dualities.CCN relies on grassroots volunteers who work directly with people, thussidestepping the government or other established institutions. This completelyorganic and non-coercive, self-generating project offers an evolutionary modelfor non-governmental governance that expands awareness by creating community.Business owner Richard Flyer, the organization’s visionary founder, describedthis new awareness network as “an intentional community without walls, with adesire to open hearts and build bridges between people of diverse beliefs andbackgrounds.”32 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en325] Flyer sees himselfand his organization as a weaver of health-enhancing, life-affirming,joy-producing elements in the community.Flyer’s communal matrix offers a largely invisible infrastructure ofrelationships that support individual, community, and planetary health. Flyersuggested, “By connecting the dots between ‘like-hearted people’ who want touplift humanity—people found within every local community and in all socialgroupings—we release the ‘creative intelligence’ to grow a new society withinthe old.”33 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en326]People in Reno and in countless other communities where wisdom councils, worldcafés, and other active listening groups form are discovering two profoundtruths. First, the connection in the heart is far more powerful than divisivebeliefs in the head. Second, the circle of inclusion is much more beneficialthan the box of separation.The heart of humanity is calling for a safe, generative environment ofrespectful communication, which is the foundation for a healthy and sanepolitical structure. As with so many other aspects of this new, transformationalstory, We the People are being called upon to release our either-or polarpositions and embrace both-and opportunities.LIFE IS PROGRESSIVE . . . AND CONSERVATIVEHere’s another reason why true security originates in the land of the heart. Asmodern life becomes more stressful and overwhelming, people tend toover-identify with their beliefs. When these beliefs are polarizing, inaccurate,or downright false, they are even more problematic because they becomelife-threatening.Consider the commonalty as well as the distinction between progressive andconservative. Both are natural impulses and elemental components of life.However, when they become beliefs—and rigid ones at that—they can harden intoopposing polarities that keep the system from growing.Since the cultural upheaval that followed the war in Vietnam, Americans havedivided themselves into two combative factions: blue-tribe progressive Democratsand red-tribe conservative Republicans. Locked in a dysfunctional conflict,these two groups spend much of their vitality and energy arguing about whetherit’s more wrong to kill the born or to kill the unborn. Meanwhile, survival ofboth the born and the not-yet-born is in danger because planetaryweb-of-life-threatening issues aren’t being addressed.If we rise above and beyond these dueling dualities, we see that bothprogressive beliefs and conservative beliefs align with the natural forces ofgrowth and protection. Fundamentally, life is progressive because it isever-growing and ever-evolving. Life is also conservative, as evidenced by ahusk that protects its vulnerable seed. A seed in its husk, like an egg in itsshell, represents the harmonious and collaborative integration of progressiveand conservative functions. Both are necessary for life to successfully moveforward.However, in our society, progressive and conservative factors are profoundly outof balance. The old story of domination has been so pervasive in our culturethat the structures of protection that we’ve built now endanger the progressionof life. The social imbalance we are afflicted with might appropriately bediagnosed as MIC, Military-Industrial Complex. MIC is a self-destructiveauto-immune disorder that is threatening the well-being of civilization.As emphasized earlier, Nature intends for us to use protection behaviors aslittle as possible. That’s because, while protection provides life-savingresponses, it also consumes massive wealth and compromises the system’slife-sustaining growth processes.That is why when we learn to rise above opposing polarities and create a stateof “emergent seeing,” we’ll recognize that, by enhancing community awareness, wereduce the need for protection. This is the exact motivation that led six NativeAmerican tribes to form the Iroquois Confederacy and 13 American colonies toform the United States. And please note the words they chose to describe thoseentities: confederacy means “an alliance for a common purpose,” and united means“a single entity in harmony.”While life and evolution seek to progress toward greater common purpose—harmonyand community—there is a conservative impulse born of the American Revolutionthat wants to ensure that freedom of the individual doesn’t become overwhelmedby the needs of the collective. Moreover, in the past century, conservativeshave become overly sensitive to the utopian dreams of Soviet and Chinesecommunism that devolved into dystopian totalitarian nightmares. In the face ofworldwide financial and military power, conservatives are rightly concernedabout the notion of an even more horrific new world order based on the sametop-down control by the powerful elite.However, the new holistic world order would be circular and profoundly differentbecause it would arise from the bottom up as a functional matrix for mutualbenefit, connection, and community. It would be an evolved perspective thatwould actually enhance individual freedom. The less we need to protect ourselvesfrom one another, the more freedom and wealth we will have to pursue happiness.And the wonderful side effect is that more happiness on the planet will meanless need for protection from each other.To build on the work of imaginal political philosophers and activists such asTom Atlee, Jim Rough, Richard Flyer, and other healers of the body politic, wewill find ourselves cohering around the new moral authority of we’re all in thistogether. From this perspective, progressive and conservative will shift frombeing two opposite polarities, seeking to dominate, and, instead, become fullyempowered dance partners, working in concert. Imagine what it would be like werewe to collectively ask and answer the questions: “How do we wish to progress?”and “What do we choose to conserve?”Thanks to the Internet’s ability to connect the global village, theseconversations are already underway. Politics is, indeed, on the cusp ofachieving its highest purpose: to promote and sustain a healthy humanity on awealthy planet where every cellular soul thrives. All that is needed now is thewillingness of a critical mass of humanity to participate in changing our story."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16A WHOLE NEW STORY“It’s time we put our energy into fruitfully re-growingthe Garden instead of fruitlessly scrapping over the scraps.”— Swami Beyondananda We have now come full circle. Our journey began with a story about the power ofstories, particularly invisible ones that permeate our consciousness and filterour experiences without our even being aware of their existence.Myth-perceptions distort our stories and have led us down the road to societaldysfunction and destruction of our sacred habitat.Now that we have explored suggestions for a new story based on newedge scienceand perennial wisdom, we are presented with a challenge: How do we change theold story and write a new one? How do we shift from a way of life based onobsolete understandings to one based on truer truths? How do we participate inthe conscious evolution of the new super-organism humanity?As the name implies, humanity is a life form defined by the trait of beinghumane. Throughout history, there have been exemplary humans who lived by thehumane values of compassion, philanthropy, kindness, tolerance, benevolence,charity, and generosity. However, as a consequence of developmental programming,profoundly influenced by myth-perceptions, too many humans live livescharacterized by indifference, intolerance, cruelty, spitefulness, and evenbarbaric behavioral traits that are far from humane. Today’s civilization, bystrict definition, more accurately represents inhumanity than humanity.From an evolutionary standpoint, we can no longer point to the best among us asevidence of our fitness. As we find our civilization precariously perched on theEndangered Species List, our biological imperative is unconsciously driving usto adopt humane traits so that humans may fully evolve into the life-sustainingorganism defined as humanity.Great idea, but how?It is evident that the current basal paradigmatic beliefs offered by scientificmaterialism, yet disproved by new science, are not able to meet our challenges.Given this understanding, the first step is to collectively detach from thelimiting beliefs that prevent us from realizing our true human potential.What if we changed our beliefs? After all, as we have seen, we are living in aworld of make believe, that is, we make what we believe. To make somethingdifferent, we must believe something different. Consider the alternativerealities that might arise by releasing the collectively agreed uponconventional beliefs that only matter matters, that the law of the jungle rules,that we are frail and powerless slaves to our genes, and that we are herebecause of a random throw of the evolutionary dice.Not only must we dismantle the obsolete story and replace it with a more viableone, we must also heal the wounds the old story has inflicted over the ages.Reprogramming and healing must occur on both an individual level and collectivelevel. In a fractal—as above, so below—reality, there cannot be an evolvedorganism without first having evolved cells.The intention of this final chapter, titled A Whole New Story, is not to providea detailed version of civilization’s new story. We offer, instead, an outlinebased on new insights from new-edge science with the hope that it will serve asthe foundation for an evolving wiki on humanity’s evolution. This wiki willinevitably be written and rewritten a great many times over the next decade aswe evolve into the new millennium. This whole new story will not be only aboutourselves or our tribe or our nation, not even only about humanity, but aboutthe whole of existence. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, though, let’sreview what we now know as well as the implications of that knowledge, in otherwords, “What’s so!” and “So what?”WHAT’S SO!—SO WHAT?Once, a friend stopped by while on a pilgrimage from Los Angeles to SanFrancisco. Our friend and six other seekers were en route to a New Agemega-conference that featured wisdom luminaries such as Deepak Chopra, WayneDyer, and Louise Hay, among others. As is our habit, we greeted and hugged ourfriend and each in his entourage as they exited their van. One of the women inthe group, with furrows between her eyes as deep as the Grand Canyon, was sostiff that, when hugged, she elicited a response from us that she should relax.That sparked an immediate and irritated response, “ I am relaxed!” and anger atthe very suggestion that she was not.After we gently reminded her of the negative physiologic consequences oftension, she rattled off a laundry list of comments about stress, tension, andhealth. Had this been an oral exam for a New Age wisdom course, this woman wouldhave received an A+ grade. However, because of the anger she generated in herdefense, she would have failed the experiential laboratory portion of such acourse.Similarly, we have been to environmental and sustainability conferences wherethe trash cans were filled to the brim with empty plastic water bottles.The point is that, while our conscious minds may easily learn new lifeenhancing-information, that information may never make it below the neck andinto the domain of action. This is understandable when we remember thatsubconscious programs control 95 percent of our behavior.If this book were part of an academic course in school, we might say, “Okay,close your text and take out a pencil and paper for a quiz.” Clearly, many ofyou would score an A by rehashing the scientific data we have provided. But,while this book offers interesting new insights to ponder, the relevance of thisinformation is predicated on the reader’s consideration of this fundamentalquestion: “How would my life be different if I incorporated this awareness intomy behavioral programming?”Civilization is now confronted with major scientific upheavals that profoundlyimpact our story and our lives. The new insights are not matters of supposition;they are matters of fact. Consequently, the story offered by new-edge sciencedoes not suggest that we change our collective behavior; it demands that wechange it!The scientific principles that necessitate behavioral change are derived frommany disciplines. The new science of holism emphasizes that, in order for us totranscend the parts and see the whole, we must acquire an understanding ofNature and the human experience.The conventional idea that biology, physics, and mathematics represent entirelydifferent fields of knowledge has become an evolution-limiting misperception.All systematic studies on the structure and behavior of the natural world areintimately entangled and fall under the one roof of science. The knowledgeaccumulated under that roof can be assembled into a structure that resembles amulti-tiered building, with each floor built upon the scientific foundationprovided by the supporting lower levels.The floors of the building, as illustrated below, represent the basic scientificdisciplines. The ground level is mathematics, upon which is assembled physics.Built upon physics is chemistry. Chemistry serves as the platform for biology,which is the basis for psychology, the building’s fifth and, currently, toplevel. Each level of science is based upon previously established levels of science.030 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_030_r1.gif]This hierarchical structure illustrates that a science on a lower level is morefundamental than a science on a higher level. As an example, Newton created thescience of physics only after he evolved the branch of mathematics known asdifferential calculus.This structural organization reveals an important insight: if the belief systemwithin a lower level of science changes, it is imperative that the belief systemon the higher levels change accordingly. However, when the belief system of ahigher science changes, those changes may not apply to lower levels.Civilization’s current awareness and, consequently, its behavior are shaped bytruths postulated under the roof of scientific materialism. The insufficienciesof these truths are contributing to and, in many cases, are solely responsiblefor the crises that currently threaten human survival. In the waning days of ourcivilization, the emergence of revisionary science is leading us to a moreevolved science, holism—a structure built on a much firmer foundation.In children’s education, students are provided with a curriculum that requiresthem to tell, “What’s so,” by reciting memorized facts. As students mature,however, they learn to ask the more valuable question, “So what?” They begin toconsider, “If such-and-such is so, what are the implications and applications ofthis knowledge in regard to my life?”Likewise, the question before civilization now is, “What do new scientificrevisions mean to humanity on Earth?” Listed below, are several relevant newscience facts about “What’s so” along with the more relevant question, “Sowhat?”Mathematics: What’s So: The principles of fractal geometry describe thestructure of Nature. So What?: Fractal geometry, the scientific foundation forfractals—as above, so below—emphasizes that self-similar patterns oforganization are found at every level of the Universe’s structure. In light ofthe success of Nature, the survival and thrival of human civilization is assuredif we consciously follow her lead.Physics: What’s So: Matter and energy, that is, spirit, are inseparable. SoWhat?: Everything in the quantum Universe—be it physical or non-physical, forexample, energy waves or thoughts—is entangled and embedded within an invisibleenergy matrix called the field. The field’s forces influence the shape of thephysical Universe similar to the way a magnet rearranges iron filings. Nostructure, from a drop of water to a human being, can ever be separated from thefield, which is the Source, All That Is, or, to some, God. What’s So: Quantummechanics acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. So What?: Weco-create reality with our beliefs, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings.Biology: What’s So: Epigenetics controls genetics. So What?: Epigeneticmolecular mechanisms represent a physical pathway along which consciousnessmakes us masters of our own health and well-being. Our field of beliefs andperceptions, individually and collectively, determine our biology and ourreality. What’s So: Evolution is derived from adaptations that provide Earthwith an integrated, balanced, and harmonious ecological community. So What?:Human evolution is not an accident. We are here to tend the Garden through ourcooperation with each other and the environment.Psychology: What’s So: The subconscious mind controls 95 percent of our behaviorand gene regulating cognitive activity through programs obtained primarily fromthe field of beliefs. So What?: When we take command of our own subconsciousbeliefs and emotions, individually and collectively, we take back creativecontrol over our lives.To summarize the really big “So what?” question about “What’s so,” we find thatthe story we tell ourselves and each other about reality and our place in itprofoundly impacts not only human civilization but the planet itself. Eventhough we perceive ourselves as small and insignificant, our collectiveconscious and unconscious beliefs are actually arranging the particles of matterthat we call reality.We referred to the field’s influence on matter through the example of invisiblemagnetic fields that organize the distribution of sprinkled iron filings.However, the field’s influence over the particle is not the whole story becausethe iron particles actually alter the shape of the magnet’s field as well. Eventhough the influence of each miniature iron particle is negligible, theindividual filings, if compressed into one, solid iron bar, will measurablydistort the field.Similarly, throughout evolution, Earth’s energy fields have shaped theorganization of primitive biological organisms and also influenced the fate ofhumans. In turn, individual persons, like iron filings, have had a small,perhaps seemingly negligible, impact on the field through their unique spheresof influence.However, the origin of human self-consciousness represents a profound change inthe story of evolution. Self-consciousness is the neurological mechanism thatendows individuals with the choice to respond or not respond to environmentalfields. Freedom of choice translates as human free will. So, while iron filingshave no capacity to self-assemble into an iron bar, human beings can consciouslypursue coherence and create a field-impacting unity called humanity.Also, an iron bar’s influence on a magnetic field is static. In contrast, humanshave the ability to dynamically and creatively change Earth’s field throughconscious intention. Through collective consciousness, civilization cantransform crises into a new sustainable reality. We can truly re-grow the Gardenand create Heaven on Earth.How do we create that coherence that will enable us to realize our “humanifestdestiny?” How do we become participants in evolution, rather than merebystanders?The first step is to rewrite the fundamental story that civilization currentlyuses to create reality. That starts, not with a story imposed from the top down,but with an outline from which the new story can emerge from the bottom up. Ithappens by looking at promising directions through which we can realize ourevolutionary destiny.HEALING THE OLD STORYSelf-similar fractal patterns of organization reverberate throughout theUniverse. As part of Nature, human culture is also built on repetitive patterns.One such pattern that has repeated itself throughout human history is that ofviolent domination, exploitation, and warfare. Almost every ethnic group hasbeen both victim and perpetrator in this long-playing tragedy.While we can find numerous examples of courage and selflessness in these warstories, the patterns of suffering expressed in both our conscious story and oursubconscious memory are the ones that seem to have most influenced our culture.In reflecting this reality, human development researcher Joseph Chilton Pearcedefined culture as “a set of beliefs and practices centered on physicalsurvival,” which he bluntly called, “a mutually shared anxiety state.”1[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en327]Thanks to thousands of years of dominator programming—and lots of historicalevidence with visual reminders—we viscerally believe it’s us versus them. And,when push comes to shove, we inevitably resort to pushing and shoving. Whilepaying lip service to the love-based Golden Rule with our conscious mind, theRule of Gold rules in the profoundly more dominant subconscious, particularlywhen it is fueled by fear and backed by coercion. How do we address thisseemingly overwhelming programming?By making the unconscious conscious. When we recognize we can be programmed byfear, we are less susceptible to manipulations by those who benefit from massconflict. Nazi leader Herman Goering acknowledged this quite plainly at theNuremberg trials when he testified, “Naturally the common people don’t want war. . . But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy,and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is ademocracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communistdictatorship . . . All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, anddenounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country todanger. It works the same in any country.”2[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en328]Those words should hold a particular relevance in the United States after thepreemptive war in Iraq failed to accomplish its touted goal of finding weaponsof mass destruction and brought the country to the brink of financial and moralbankruptcy. We can rightfully refer to the eight-year Bush-Cheney Administrationas an intense fear-based educational experience for which both the U.S.A. andthe world paid a very high tuition.Evolution is synonymous with learning, and learning is based on patternrecognition, which is why we derive awareness by recognizing patterns andunderstanding their meaning. Situations perceived as problems or puzzles onlyexist until their underlying patterns are identified and understood.But once we acquire information from a learning experience, we can memorize itand take it into our consciousness so that former or similar problems or puzzlesneed not be re-experienced. And with that learning, we are free to release theold story.One reason that history repeats itself is that humans have consistently insistedon not learning the lessons. Instead, we opt for blame and vengeance, which iswhy it is not enough to merely debunk or dismantle old limiting or destructivestories with new learning. We must also come to an understanding—even anappreciation—that the victims and villains who have played roles in this dramahave acted out of their own programming. The culprit isn’t necessarily theindividual, but the repeating pattern of behavior.The suggestion that we release the actors from their drama is, for many,untenable and may even provoke anger. That’s because these stories, whileintellectually perceived in the mind, are simultaneously encoded with bodilyemotions. Joseph Chilton Pearce emphasized that emotions that hold stories inplace must be addressed before the stories can be released, and that resolutionrequires us to acknowledge and heal the spiritual, psychological, and emotionalwounds.History also reveals that forgiveness doesn’t come easily. It seems as if an18th century couplet by poet Alexander Pope, “To err is human; to forgive isdivine,” is deeply implanted in our collective consciousness. Lacking aperception of our own divinity, most people conveniently leave forgiveness inthe hands of God and neighborhood divinities, such as Jill, who is acclaimed asa saint for forgiving Jack!However, new-edge science reveals we are intimately entangled and one with AllThat Is. Being fruit of the Divine, forgiveness is truly within our domain. TheBiblical injunction, “Forgive them; they know not what they do,” is reaffirmedby the new science that tells us that 95 percent of our behavior is unconscious.With that in mind, ponder this thought: if either party in a personal disputewere conscious, the whole affair would have never occurred. When we truly becomeaware that most of our behavior is invisible to ourselves and that ourperceptions can be distorted by our beliefs, we can logically forgive otherswho, like us, honestly know not what they do. While forgiveness can be based ontruth and logic, healing is driven by love.Earlier, we documented some extraordinary feats of ordinary human beings, suchas lifting cars and helicopters to save a loved one’s life. Then, in Chapter 13,The One Suggestion, we examined Leonard Laskow’s experiments in which loveshrunk cancer tumors. In our need to metabolize the political toxins that haveaccumulated from our histories of mutual perpetrations, might we be able to onceagain call on love to do the heavy lifting?One of the most visionary experiments of the past two decades was the use oflove, truth, and forgiveness to heal centuries of colonialism in South Africa.In 1989, Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, which was therevolutionary movement to end apartheid in South Africa, was freed after 27years in prison. While spending more than a third of one’s life behind barsmight breed bitterness and rage in most people, Mandela managed to transmute hisexperience into spiritual wisdom and compassion. Upon his release, Mandela vowedto create a peaceful and respectful transition from apartheid to multiracialrule.As president of South Africa in 1994, Mandela created the Truth andReconciliation Commission (TRC) because, in his words, “Only the truth can putthe past to rest.” The purpose of this commission was to acknowledge politicalcrimes committed by both the government and revolutionary forces and to allowperpetrators to confess these crimes and seek amnesty in exchange for theirtruthful testimony. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Africa’s foremostspiritual leader and proponent of the traditional tribal philosophy of ubuntuwas chairman of the TRC.Ubuntu in the Bantu language represents the connection between the individual,humanity, and the world, which is reminiscent of the interpretation of religare,as described in Chapter 10. African historian and journalist Stanlake J. W. T.Samkange lists three maxims that characterize ubuntu:3[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en329]a. We affirm our own humanity by recognizing the humanity of others.b. When faced with the choice of human life or wealth, we choose life.c. The king owes his status to the will of the people under him.Hmm. That sounds a lot like the Golden Rule, Jesus overturning themoneychangers’ tables, and government empowered by sovereign citizens.Traditional ubuntu philosophy clearly contributed to the creation of the Africanreconciliation movement with its intention to repair the fabric of thecommunity.While citing the South African state as the primary culprit for apartheid, theTRC’s final report acknowledged and condemned atrocities on both sides. Thecommission’s evolutionary mission, driven by the healing intentions of bothMandela and Tutu, paved the way for a peaceful transfer of power in SouthAfrica. The love and forgiveness that the commission advocated was notnicey-nicey sentimentality; rather, it required real courage and spiritualfortitude.The intent for reconciliation was tested even before Mandela was electedpresident when his African National Congress associate Chris Hani wasassassinated in 1993. With the country on the brink of retributive violence,Mandela addressed the nation with these words: “Tonight I am reaching out toevery single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being. Awhite man, full of prejudice and hate, came to our country and committed a deedso foul that our whole nation now teeters on the brink of disaster. A whitewoman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know, and bring tojustice, this assassin . . . Now is the time for all South Africans to standtogether against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hanigave his life for—the freedom of all of us.”4[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en330]Imagine how different the world would be today if an American President hadgiven this kind of address in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attack on theWorld Trade Center. Might it have precipitated reverberations of love andfunctionality at a time when America had the world’s sincere compassion? Wethink so.Mandela’s spiritual leadership prevented a new nation from dying in childbirth.In spite of its limitations, the truth and reconciliation process enabled anentire nation to participate in forgiveness. The TRC also inspired otherprojects and ventures to bring love into the political sphere.In 2000, Dr. Fred Luskin, director of the Stanford Forgiveness Project andauthor of Forgive for Good, brought a small group of Protestants and Catholics,all of whom had lost loved ones in the war in Northern Ireland, to California aspart of a project he called HOPE—an acronym for Healing Our Past Experience.For some, their loss had occurred more than 20 years earlier, but their griefhad never gone away. The first breakthrough came as both Catholics andProtestants recognized that the grief they shared in common transcended theoppositional sides on which they found themselves. When the week-long projectended, participants filled out questionnaires to assess emotional andphysiological change. The participants reported that they felt lower levels ofhurt, anger, and depression. In addition, they experienced a 35-percentreduction in physiological symptoms of emotional stress such as irregular sleeppatterns, unusual appetite, low energy levels, and physical aches and pains.5[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en331]While these results are heartening, the question still remains, “Can love reallyheal toxic emotions, particularly the malignancy of hatred?” Leonard Laskow’sloving cancer cells in a petri dish is one thing, but what happens in the realworld when hatred is actually at your doorstep?In Not by the Sword, Kathryn Watterson tells the story of Michael Weisser, aJewish cantor, and his wife, Julie.6 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en332]They had recently moved to their new home in Lincoln, Nebraska, in June 1991when their peaceful unpacking was interrupted by a threatening phone call.Shortly afterward, they received a package of racist flyers with a card thatannounced: “The KKK is watching you, scum.” The police told the Weissers itlooked like the work of Larry Trapp, a self-described Nazi and local Ku KluxKlan grand dragon. Trapp had been linked to fire bombings of African Americanhomes in the area and a center for Vietnamese refugees. The 44-year-old Trapp,leader of the area’s white supremacist movement, was wheelchair bound and haddiabetes. At the time, he was making plans to bomb B’nai Jeshuran, the synagoguewhere Weisser was cantor.Julie Weisser, while frightened and infuriated by the hate mail, also felt aspark of compassion for Trapp, who lived alone in a one-room apartment. Shedecided to send Trapp a letter every day with passages from Proverbs. WhenMichael saw that Trapp had launched a hate-spewing TV series on the local cablenetwork, he called the Klan hotline and kept leaving messages: “Larry, why doyou hate me? You don’t even know me.”At one point, Trapp actually answered the phone and Michael, after identifyinghimself, asked him if he needed a hand with his grocery shopping. Trapp refused,but a process of rethinking began to stir in him. For a while, he was twopeople: one still spewing invective on TV; the other talking with MichaelWeisser on the phone, saying, “I can’t help it, I’ve been talking like that allmy life.”One night, Michael asked his congregation to pray for someone who is “sick fromthe illness of bigotry and hatred.” That night, Trapp did something he’d neverdone before. The swastika rings he wore on both hands began to itch, so he tookthem off. The next day, he called the Weissers and said, “I want to get out, butI don’t know how.” Michael suggested that he and Julie drive to Trapp’sapartment so they could “break bread together.” Trapp hesitated, then agreed.At the apartment, Trapp broke into tears and handed the Weissers his swastikarings. In November 1991, he resigned from the Klan and later wrote apologies tothe groups he had wronged. On New Year’s Eve, Larry Trapp found out he had lessthan a year to live, and, that same night, the Weissers invited him to move inwith them. Their living room became Trapp’s bedroom, and he told them, “You aredoing for me what my parents should have done for me.”Bedridden, Trapp began to read about Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King,Jr., and to learn about Judaism. On June 5, 1992, he converted to Judaism—at thevery synagogue he had once planned to blow up. Julie quit her job to care forLarry Trapp in his last days, and when he died on September 6th of that year,Michael and Julie were holding his hands.The lifting of cars, the lifting of karma. With love, both are possible. Bothare extraordinary examples that point the way to spontaneous evolution. We—andthe power of love we possess—are bigger than our stories. Yet, it takes morethan good intentions to activate the power of love. While a worldwide healingceremony to metabolize the accumulated toxins of human history would be abreakthrough, each of us—like a little piece of iron—must individually confrontour own programming in order to transform evolutionary possibility into reality.CHANGING THE INNERSPHERECivilization’s quest for freedom has permeated the history of the world and,specifically, America for the last two centuries. Over that time, citizens inWestern society have acquired unprecedented freedom to travel, to experience, toexplore, and to learn.Now, a different type of freedom is evolving. This one is more internal thanexternal, more at the heart of humanity’s evolution. It is freedom from limitingand unwanted subconscious programming.New science is echoing the ancient truth that the human mind is the ultimateprison. Programmed in the mind’s information field are behaviors that bind andrestrain us like manacles and chains. Like the baby elephant that inaccuratelylearns it cannot break its tethering rope, we, too, are often tied up in “nots,”a matrix of negative beliefs that we are incapable of achieving our dreams orfulfilling our destiny.Many people seek personal freedom by consciously and diligently devouringself-help book after self-help book, only to end up feeling more discouraged andhelpless. Somehow, great ideas on paper too often fail to materialize in life.The problem relates to the fact that, while the contents of the books are readand understood by the conscious mind, the information rarely integrates into ormodifies preexisting behavior-controlling programs in the subconscious. What canwe do about that?The first hugely liberating step is to truly realize that each of us, regardlessof how spiritually evolved we may imagine ourselves to be, engage in largelyinvisible shadow behaviors. Consider the number of gurus, politicians, andself-proclaimed moral guardians who have been literally caught with their pantsdown. Our clearest path to learning is not to make such people either villainsor victims but to use the opportunity to cultivate humility and forgiveness.Once we understand how much of our behavior is unconsciously controlled by thebeliefs of others, each of us can legitimately be released from the shackles ofblame and shame.Another step is to own responsibility for the stories in our lives. Denyingresponsibility for our participation acknowledges victimization, which, bydefinition, makes our situation one of helplessness. Only when we ownresponsibility do we have an opportunity to cultivate processes and practicesthat empower us to respond differently the next time we are revisited byprevious stressful situations. Life success is predicated on navigating ouractions with conscious decisions rather than engaging in reflexive,preprogrammed subconscious behaviors.Those seeking conscious control over their lives are finding support for theirefforts from both ancient and modern resources. While an in-depth exploration ofprocesses for consciously managing our lives is beyond the subject of this book,we suggest that the pathway for change involves at least three fundamentalelements: intention, choice, and practice.Intention: Intention serves as a great declaration of purpose and direction. Asthe old saying goes, “If you don’t know where you are going, you are likely toend up there.” In the case of our personal evolution, a suitable intention wouldbe to weave our talents, loves, and mission to support the newly emergingbutterfly organism. Ancient and modern spiritual teachers collectively recognizethat setting an intention draws new experiences to us like a magnet. Ifnecessity is the mother of invention, intention is most likely the father.Choice: Setting intentions may set things in motion on the subconscious plane,but, for true change, intentions must also be reflected in our daily consciouschoices. By accepting the implication within Spontaneous Evolution that we areall cellular souls in an evolving superorganism called humanity, we need to ask,“What daily choices can I personally make to reinforce this emergent worldview?”For some, the answer might mean changing careers. For others, it might meangrowing a garden or performing a kind act each day. Each individual’s choicewill be unique and represent the highest form of self-expression in thesetransformational times.Practice: As suggested earlier, Heaven isn’t a destination, it’s a practice. Tofacilitate our maturation from children of God to adults of God, we can engagein practices and exercises that create congruency between our inner selves andour outer expression. We can support our evolution by selecting a practice orprocess that harmonizes the outer world with our inner well-being.Fortunately, there are many very old and very new resources and processes tosupport conscious transformation. The variety of approaches simply reflects thefact that no one size fits all. Selecting a practice to maximize our potentialis truly a matter of personal choice.One of the most ancient practices to regain conscious control over one’s life isBuddhist mindfulness. Fundamentally, mindfulness is a training exercise to reignin the conscious mind’s wandering into the past and future in order to focus onthe present moment and make aware choices in the now. Essentially, mindfulnessdisengages automatic subconscious programs so that the conscious mind, the seatof our personal wishes and aspirations, can generate behavior that is coherentwith our intentions.While mindfulness generates harmony by focusing on mental exercises, someharmonizing practices specifically focus on bodily sensations and movement.Meditation, yoga, breath work, relaxation, tai chi, and qigong cultivate innerharmony and coherence.A classic, but generally insufficient, approach of modifying sabotagingsubconscious behaviors invokes various forms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,which is talk therapy that provides a mirror for observing, understanding, andaltering limiting subconscious programs. Recently, a very effective new practicecalled Body Centered Therapy has evolved from the integration of talk therapywith the meditative physical practices.Other modalities that facilitate rewriting of subconscious programs includeaffirmations, conventional clinical hypnotherapy, and a number of new energypsychology modalities. Energy psychology is an exciting innovation that helpsmanage limiting beliefs. Interventions are based on recognition and manipulationof the human vibrational fields derived from the interactions of the neural andcardiac biofields, the chakra energy centers, and the energy pathways thatinclude acupuncture meridians. Most amazingly, energy psychology practices—ofwhich there are many, including Holographic Repatterning, the BodyTalk System,as well as the one with which we are most familiar PSYCH-K—have been shown tomake lasting behavioral changes, frequently in a matter of minutes. A partiallist of belief-changing modalities is included in the Appendix.Meanwhile, organizations like the Institute of HeartMath are developing newpractices to entrain brain and heart functions that reduce stress whileprofoundly enhancing neurological processing powers. Similarly, the OnenessBlessing described by Arjuna Ardagh represents a prototype for group practicesthat create healthier, more coherent human fields worldwide.The power of group coherence was illustrated on May 20, 2007, a date designatedas Global Peace Meditation and Prayer Day.7[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en333] More than one million people in 65countries meditated and prayed for peace at a synchronized moment in time. Theresults were similar to those random number generators (RNGs) that shifted intocoherence during events like Princess Diana’s funeral or the attack on the WorldTrade Center. In fact, Global Coherence Initiative researcher Roger Nelsonreported that monitors around the world recorded measurable increases in thecoherence of RNGs while the meditation was in process. Yes, coherentconsciousness impacts Earth’s fields!The implications of these initial findings are profound. Could meditations andgroup intentions such as these provide a template for creating a human awarenessstrong enough to influence the planetary field in the same way that iron filingscompressed into an iron bar can influence the force field of a magnet? Could thevision of a coherent civilization whose collective consciousness is focused onlove, health, harmony, and happiness truly create a field strong enough tomanifest Heaven on Earth?Yes, we think so. In fact, they are.But it’s important to keep in mind that these changes aren’t happening on thelevel of cosmic consciousness alone. Rather, this connection and coherencemanifests daily as millions of random and not-so-random acts of kindness andfunctionality. Like the multiplying of loaves and fishes, each of these acts, inturn, ripples outward and creates more of the same.But what if you have no interest in meditation or spiritual practice, believethat therapy is good only for strained muscles, and have no compulsion to gopoking around your own subconscious for beliefs to reframe? Research revealsthat you can still manifest positive results by simply changing your story.That story we tell ourselves can have direct bearing on the quality of our livesand our health. Dr. Gail Ironson, professor of psychology and psychiatry at theUniversity of Miami, found that HIV patients who believed in a loving universalpower remained healthier longer than those who believed in one that waspunishing.8 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en334] Sounds like aprescription for creating our own placebo to counteract the prevailing nocebogenerated by our culture’s negative stories.Problems arise in this intellectually based freedom story when seemingly badthings are happening to you. At such times, it is difficult to experience theworld as a friendly place. How can one generate positive feelings when there isno reason to be happy?Author Marci Shimoff offered a provocative suggestion in the title of her bookHappy For No Reason. Shimoff wrote: “When you’re happy for no reason, you bringhappiness to your outer experiences rather than trying to extract happiness fromthem.”9 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en335]If this seems like simplistic let-a-smile-be-your-umbrella happy talk, considerthis scientific reality: Your facial expression actually triggers bodilyproduction of emotional chemistry that is related to both happiness andunhappiness. Emotions specifically shape physiological and physical responsesthat accompany our behaviors. Conventionally, we tend to perceive that emotionsare the driving force behind our behavioral experiences. However, new sciencehas revealed an amazing discovery that our physical expressions can driveemotional responses.French physiologist Dr. Israel Waynbaum discovered that frowning triggers thesecretion of the stress hormones cortisol, adrenalin, and noradrenaline, whichare neurochemicals that inhibit the immune system, raise blood pressure, andincrease susceptibility to anxiety and depression. Smiling, on the other hand,reduces secretion of stress hormones and raises the production of endorphins,which are the body’s natural feel-good hormones, while simultaneously enhancingthe function of the immune system by increasing T-cell production.10[bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en336]When downloading learning experiences into memory, the brain links emotions withbehavioral responses. The biological reactions involved with this process cangenerally flow both forwards and backward, which means that an emotion can drivean experience and an experience can elicit an emotion. This is an importantcharacteristic relative to memory-capture.Scientists have recently identified a particular class of visuomotor nerve cellscalled mirror neurons. Research involving monkeys shows that these nerve cellsfire both when a monkey does a particular action and when it observes anotherindividual, be it a monkey or a human, doing a similar action. Identical mirrorneurons are also found in human brains. Have you ever squirmed while watching amovie in which a giant spider is crawling on an actor? Have you ever cried inresponse to someone else’s tears or laughed when they did? If so, you wereresponding to the function of mirror neurons, which replay learned personalresponses derived from our own experiences when we observe others having similarexperiences. 11 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en337]When we act, we intend to reach a goal. Conversely, when we observe someone elseact, mirror neurons translate their behaviors so we can often infer theirintentions. Neuroscientists listening in on brain cells suggest that mirrorneurons are at the root of empathy, which is the ability to discern others’thoughts and intentions.Mirror neurons play a major role in the creation of coherence in an evolvinghuman population. Consider the consequences of seeding individuals in apopulation who express love, joy, happiness, or gratitude. Mirror neurons in thebrains of the observing public would stimulate them to experience the samesensations. These neurons would initiate a neurological chain reaction throughwhich an entire population would catch the healthy vibe of positive feelings.This is why charismatic leaders, such as Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy, andMartin Luther King, Jr., have such a profound effect on the public’s emotionsand attitudes.The “So what?” component of these insights is that our attitude and ourinterpretation of circumstances profoundly influence the outcome of ourexperiences. According to Dr. Martin Seligman at the University ofPennsylvania’s Positive Psychology Center, optimistic responses can be learned.A self-described born pessimist, Seligman maintains that modern societyreinforces victimhood and learned helplessness. He suggests that helplessnesscan be reprogrammed by choosing a healthier perspective in the face ofchallenges. For example, Seligman recommends reframing bad events as temporarysetbacks, isolated to particular circumstances that can be overcome by one’sefforts and abilities.12 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en338]Marci Shimoff offers her own reframe prescription. She advises that, whenplagued by a persistent negative thought, lean into an equally true positivethought about the same situation. To seek equanimity, she suggests repeating theadvice of Zen masters who pray: “Thank you for everything. I have no complaintswhatsoever.”13 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en339]We chose not to fill this chapter with information on techniques for addressingthe innersphere because the accelerated evolution in this field wouldnecessitate frequent revisions. Like rapidly mutating bacteria seeking to adjustto environmental challenges, human cells in the newly forming organism calledhumanity are actively experimenting with practices to secure freedom fromlimiting beliefs. Such practices are topics ideally suited for a dynamicworldwide wiki. The Web’s platform offers the public access to the best, latest,and most helpful transformative practices that are being tried, tested, andcontinuously revised.FROM DUELING DUALITIES TO DYNAMIC DUOBeyond the need for individual and societal reprogramming, spontaneous evolutionnecessitates at least one more significant cognitive leap. We have beenprogrammed with the myth-perception of the world as a battleground for eternallydueling dualities: progressive versus conservative; competition versuscooperation; science versus religion; creation versus evolution; growth versusprotection; spirit versus matter; wave versus particle, and eagle versus condor,among many, many more versuses.For millennia, the polarization of life’s traits has fractured civilization byforcing individuals and groups to take sides. And, while this list of polarizedpairs could go on for many pages, the few examples here emphasize that the worldis derived from the integration of opposing tendencies.Evolutionary unity now necessitates that we own the awareness that opposingcharacters are actually cooperative partners in evolution’s dynamic dance. At notime is this “up-wising” needed more than when resolving the perceptualdysfunction that masculine and feminine represent oppositional forces. After5,000 years of dominator programming, the battle of the sexes is taken as agiven, with, of course, the man on top.Conventional biology still perceives of Nature in terms of the Darwiniannightmare of a world eternally engulfed in life-threatening competition.Geneticists apply this perception when they refer to battles of dominance wagedbetween male genes and female genes. But the dominator story makes no biologicalsense at all. When a sperm and egg unite to create a new life, does one defeatthe other? In Glynda-Lee Hoffmann’s groundbreaking book, The Secret Dowry ofEve: Woman’s Role in the Development of Consciousness, she wrote: “There is nohierarchy between a germ and a husk. They work together or they don’t work atall.”14 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en340]Scientific insights from physics and biology on the nature of polarized traitsreveal that, while these traits appear to be separate and opposing entities,they are actually rooted together in a unity. Interestingly, Easternphilosophers grasped the truth of this unity almost 4,000 years ago when theydefined the relationship between yin and yang.The yin-yang symbol contains two separate, but entangled, entities: one whiteand one black. However, a black spot resides in the white entity, and a whitespot resides in the black entity, an indication that both entities are made outof the same elements. Externally, we see males and females, regardless ofspecies, as being physically different, but, internally, both males and femaleshave masculine and feminine hormones. The yin-yang symbol consists of two separateentities, black and white, yet eachentity contains the seed of the other.031 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_031_r1.jpg]In recognition of this inherent equality portrayed by yin and yang, the notionof masculine primacy makes absolutely no sense. Hence, the entire concept of abattle of the sexes makes as much sense as a battle between the particle and thewave. The integrated worldview in which both the masculine and feminineprinciples are in full balanced power is the key to the birth of a new humanity.CAN HUMANS ACHIEVE HUMANITY?There are those who insist that human consciousness is not up to thisevolutionary task. Spiritual determinists, for example, insist we are hopelesslyflawed sinners who can only be saved through Divine intervention. Intellectualelitists point to massive ignorance on the part of the masses and to ourall-too-obvious failings as a humane species.Yet, indications suggest we may have underestimated the extent of the currentstate of awakening. In Our Own Words 2000, a comprehensive research projectpublished by the Fund for Global Awakening in 2007, reported that 85 percent ofAmericans believe, “underneath it all, we’re all connected as one.” A whopping93 percent agree that “it’s important to teach our children to feel connected tothe earth, people, and all life.”15 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_nts_r1.html#en341]Perhaps the most important sign that humanity is actively evolving is theelection of Barack Hussein Obama as President of the United States. Obama’scampaign rose above dueling dualities and spoke to the inherent humanity in allof the world’s citizens. His vision of hope, change, and global communalcooperation are fundamental elements necessary for creation of a sustainableholistic paradigm. The election of Obama, as the voice of imaginal cellseverywhere, is a sign that we have withdrawn our investment of time, energy,attention, and intention from the caterpillar and are now casting our fate withthe butterfly. As a world leader, Obama’s words echoed the conclusion in Chapter13, The One Suggestion: “We’re all in this together.”There is one more factor in Obama’s election that has evolutionary significance,and that is his background as a community organizer. The very trait disparagedby those who cling to an obsolete paradigm represents the pathway to humanity’sspontaneous evolution. Remember, all evolution moves forward by increasingcommunity and expanding awareness.If this evolutionary step toward planetary coherence seems huge, perhaps we needan even bigger perspective: The evolution of humanity is not an ending; it is abeginning. This stage of humanity’s development completes the evolution of ourplanet. Through the evolution of humanity, we will come to see Earth not as aphysical planet but as a living cell. What happens when a cell fulfills itsevolution? It assembles into colonies with other evolved cells to shareawareness.Upon completing its evolution, Earth will connect with other aware Earth-likeplanets to continue the process of expanding awareness about who we are, what weare, and the nature of the Universe in which we live.Meanwhile, back in the here and now, we are the leaders we’ve been waiting for.Although we may be inspired by the election of Obama and basking in the warmbreeze of political climate change, at this evolutionary crossroads, theemphasis is not on individuals who lead from the top. The emphasis is on theawakening of all cellular souls who create a coherent loving field so empoweredleaders can be attuned to the healthy central voice of the super-organism thatis humanity.Consequently, the real challenge for the individual is to practice evolution, tolearn the lessons of the old stories so we no longer need to repeat them, and toremind ourselves that the critical mass of humanity involved with this evolutionwill change the world from the inside out. We are living in a positive future,practicing Heaven, and designing a bridge across which the whole of humanitywill walk.This is our love story—a universal love story for the entire Universe: you, me,everyone, and every living organism, too.

He used Euclidean geometry, the highest mathematicsavailable to him at the time. Da Vinci based his iconic drawing on the writingsof Vitruvius (27 B.C.E.), a Roman architect and engineer who was greatlyinfluenced by Pythagoras (580-500 BC).Over the centuries, Vitruvian Man has become unarguably one of the most powerfulsymbols of humanity as a whole—male and female alike (even though the image isovertly male). What’s more impressive is that to this day it immediately andeffortlessly conveys to the viewer the sense that there is more going on “behindthe scenes” than meets the eye!What I like is taking that centuries-old iconic image and adding imaginativewings to it—because the visual metaphor so readily implies a naturalmetamorphosis of all of humanity, as well as a positive, beautiful future for usall. Moreover, I like to think that da Vinci himself might even appreciate theuse of fractal geometry to “extend” his creation in this way, since his visionembraced mathematics as a clue to our divine origin, and this modern-day branchof mathematics was not available to him.Finally, the addition of the two flowing symmetrical golden mean (phi) spiralsemanating from Vitruvian Man’s navel and gracing the tips of his evolutionary“wings” not only bridges the two mathematics, but supplies a visual metaphor fortime and evolution itself. The golden mean ratio was an enigmatic and “divine”geometric concept in Leonardo’s time. Today we recognize that the Fibonaccisequence upon which the golden mean spiral was based is actually an iterativefractal equation.As a fractal, this “divinely proportioned” self-similar spiral extends forwardand backwards without end. Trace the spirals back through humanity’s navel andyou find we were born of the cosmos itself . . . and the white light ofcreation. Trace them forwards, out beyond our now-sprouting evolutionary wingsand you will find . . . blue skies. And yes, you can call me optimistic. bOB September, 2009"},{"pageContent":"ENDNOTESPREAMBLE: SPONTANEOUS “RE-MISSION”1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_fm3_r1.html#Ref-en1] Lord Martin Rees, “Martin Reescomment on doomsday clock,” The Royal Society Science News (17 January 2007):press release.2 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_fm3_r1.html#Ref-en2] Margaret Mead, InternationalEarth Day speech delivered at the United Nations March 20, 1977, reprinted inEarth Trustees Program Newsletter, 1978, 1.PART I: WHAT IF EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG1 [bano_9781401926687_oeb_p01_r1.html#Ref-en3] Robert Watson, A.H.
