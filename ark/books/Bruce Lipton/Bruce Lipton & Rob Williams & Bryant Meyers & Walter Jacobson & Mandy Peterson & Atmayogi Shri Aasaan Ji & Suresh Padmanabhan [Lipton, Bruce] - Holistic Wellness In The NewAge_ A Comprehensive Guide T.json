You picked up this book right now and you reading it, confirmsthat you are a light worker! A light worker is someone who spreads light throughhis or her work.Welcome to the world of holistic wellness!!In this New Age with its rising challenges and scope for awakening, it isimportant that we should all be aware of healing modalities because the journeyto self realization begins with healing on all levels i.e. body, mind andspirit. Many people learn and work with different modalities and get benefit andyet there are many people who are skeptical and do not fully trust a naturalsystem of healing…for lack of understanding and access millions of people sufferfrom disease and stress, and this affects us all, it is time we wake up! Now isthe time to embrace your inner calling. No healing modality or spiritual path isgood or bad. It all depends on what you are most comfortable with and whatresonates with your essence. One person may feel Reiki energy to workwonderfully while another person may find Pranic Healing or Angels bettersuited. You have to find it within you, connect with it and let it flow.This book is divided into two sections – spiritual-healing modalities andmotivational articles. We have strived here to include as many varied andpopular healing modalities as possible. Each chapter includes the ESSENCE, thePROCESS and the TECHNIQUE. The technique is something you take back home! Themodalities and motivational articles are categorized here under differentthemes. The themes are: The wellness Approach, The Belief Approach, The BeingApproach and The Body Approach.We are both blessed and cursed with a tool called MIND. This mind if leftunchecked to seek the objects of senses becomes the cause of our ignorance andif we apply this mind to tap the boundless energy and channelize it we can gainlifelong well-being and abundance. This book’s purpose is to reveal differentways in which you can attain this goal of healing and realization.This book can also be your guide in a similar way like the I-Ching. Close youreyes and think of one area of life where you are experiencing a challenge. Onceyou have a clear picture, keep this book in your hands and keep an intention inmind that this book will give you a message or a way that you need RIGHT NOW.Now open a page. You will surely find the guidance your heart is seeking.I’ll share here an experience that made me realize how the universe talks to us.I was sitting with my nephew Aryan in a beachside cafe, looking at the numberedtable Aryan said, “Maasi (Aunt) look! It’s 1 and 2”. I saw the number which was12, but for Aryan, who still hasn’t learned the number 12, it was two separatedigits...the numbers 1 and 2. Both his perception and my perception weredifferent and thus we saw and understood the same thing differently, thisinsight made me realize how profound the universe’s wisdom is that allows amillion different ways of understanding and expressing the same truth.The more awareness we gather, more we understand both the parts and the whole ofthis picture called cosmic creation. The GESTALT school of psychology says thatthe whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Mere dots take on a meaning whenwe can see a circle out of it. Words alone do not make sense until perceptioncreates meaning out of a context. We would never have known the meaning of theworld if there weren’t an eagle’s point of view. I wonder if Einstein and Newtonalso experienced what we call the “aha” moment, when you realize that what youwere looking for was right there all along, all you had to do was change theperspective. And this is what the role of every healer and teacher is i.e. tofacilitate a shift of perspective for a patient or a student.Is it our ultimate goal to find the whole? Isn’t that what we’re doing all thetime, from asking our best friend about relationship advice or seeking knowledgefrom a guru or seeing our eternity in our children, we are constantly lookingfor the bigger picture. From where does this seeking for knowledge and lovecome? And where does it go? The answers as many as there are minds and hearts.The teacher was once a seeker but in order to teach, he always seeks.The seeker is both a teacher and a student all through his life. And we are alldestined to walk this path sometime or the other. If you have started already,may this book help you in all that you seek and more.Swatika Jain is a certified clinical hypnotherapist with a Masters Degree inPsychology.

"},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD “The secret of getting things done is to act!” -Dante Alighieri Wellness is the natural state of human beings. Illness is a state where one doesnot feel well. While quantum physics has opened a new vista in the field ofhuman physiology defined in its wholeness replacing the old definition based onreductionist, mechanistic biochemistry; the world has now come to realize thatthe conventional definition of health given by the WHO needs change. In thiscontext the IOM, the audit body of US medical establishment, in their February2010 meeting, had accepted the new definition of whole Person Healing (WPH) asthe future reference for healthcare system.Wellness (conventionally called health) is now defined as “enthusiasm to workand enthusiasm to be compassionate.” Interestingly, this fits in with the time-honored definition of health in Indian Ayurveda, the mother of all medicalwisdoms in the world, existing from the time of the Vedas. We have now come onefull circle in the so-called scientific medicine with a down to earth holisticdefinition of health. The man who led the movement for WPH was late ProfessorRustum Roy, one of the greatest scientists the world ever had. He was one of thefounder members of the IOM.The marketing and promotion done by conventional medical industry has trickedmillions of people into a delusional world of well being where everything has aquick fix, and the harmful effects of these medications are considered forselling another quick fix. And the game keeps on. “Over 40? It is time to fix adate for mammogram and the cost has come down for this holiday season from the3950 INR to just 1750,” reads the prominent headline advertisement in The NewIndian express of the October 9th, 2011 in Chennai. This kind of diseasemongering efforts, are at the root of all our problems in medical care system.They are based on the wrong science of reductionism. Cancer is not a disease inthe true sense. Cancer cells are a bunch of “jobless, directionless, wandering,rogue cells” which remain in the human system for years before they show up asclinical cancer only when their numbers have swollen to millions. Therefore, theso-called early diagnosis of cancer and cancer screening in the apparentlyhealthy populations are only myths, although they make good business sense forthe cancer industry.While I have been writing about this for years, the US government has issued acircular that screening for prostate cancer using PSA test is unscientific andunreliable. Mammogram is not far from that truth. In fact, many places routinemammograms have been given up as mammograms themselves could help generatecancers to grow faster from those wandering cells which otherwise would havedied a natural death before they become clinical cancers. Cancer research is anarea where the “so called” cancer researchers can tap from a bottom less pocketof the research funds. The research has gone too far from reality intovivisectionist research from reductionism.This year’s Nobel is an example of that last statement. The three people thatsucceeded in finding out the small receptor on human immune cells have got thePrize. That receptor or its ligand (for making a drug) will not solve anyproblem. The immune system works as a whole and in association with the othersystems of the human being. This has been proven time and again but we do notseem to learn our lessons from our mistakes. Our cloning efforts, our geneticengineering efforts, our stem cell (exogenous) research have all come to naught.In fact, we conveniently forget the efforts of those researchers who have shownus the right path for stem cells research.Way back in the early 1950s Professor Robert Becker of the New York UniversityMedical School, a great brain in orthopedic surgery, had shown how the bodycells, wherever they are, under stress and urgent need, could transformthemselves into pluripotent stem cells. This is the body’s own effort to produceendogenous stem cells. He demonstrated that the red blood cells at a fracturesite under the periosteum of the broken bone could slowly change into nucleatedcells and then put out pseudopodia to become real powerful pluripotentendogenous stem cells, which know what to do to heal the bone.Whereas the stem cells produced by us in the laboratory from any source, whenintroduced into the human body, need the help of the environment to do what weintend them to do, endogenous stem cells are born with the message to do what isneeded. The internal environment for the exogenous stem cells includes not justthe body as we see it but the mind. In fact, human body is the human mind seenas a solid body according to quantum physics! The exogenous stem cells couldeven harm the human system as happened with the first attempts to treatchildhood cancers with this method. The original cancer died but a new cancercropped up! Dolly, the first cloned animal died prematurely as she was as old asher mother (from whom the original cell was used for cloning) and suffered fromold age diseases like cancer and joint damage even in infancy! Eric Drexler’sefforts to produce self-replicating nanobots, which do not require father andmother, died a premature death before it took off. Drexler made billions fromhis company shareholders when he claimed that human beings could be made in thelaboratory! Venture capitalists poured millions into his kitty without anyreturns at the end of the day.AIDS research is another example. While the protean causes of that syndrome arestill very vague, researchers make hay when the research funds pour in plenty.They are still going after that poor virus, the HIV, whose original sin was thatit was discovered in the bone marrow of that first young homosexual in SanFrancisco who died of the syndrome in 1981. In retrospect, we now know that anygerm could be found in such patients, as their immune guard is very weak. Theoriginal paper of this association between HIV and AIDS in the prestigiousjournal Science was only a case history. Based on that case report the author,Luc Montaigner, got his Nobel recently.Time has come to think afresh in this area of repetitive research in preferenceto that of holistic refutative research. When we understand wellness and thereal definition of health, we would quickly realize that all illness managementhas to be holistic where the body, mind and environment of the patient are takeninto consideration. The era of disease and diagnosis will replace the era ofunderstanding the suffering human being (the patient) in trying to make himwhole again. And that is called healing. Research must be true “outcomes”research and not research to better surrogate end points as we do now. Oneexample will be in order here. All the studies of cholesterol lowering effortswith reductionist chemicals starting with the original choestyramine to thepresent statins have only shown the effect of their lowering the blood report ofcholesterol levels while they all showed higher death rates in the treated groupat the end of the day. Death is the real outcome while lowered blood report is asurrogate end point. The story seems to be similar with our efforts to lowermany of the fluctuating biological levels, which we have been labeling as“diseases”.Reductionist chemical molecular therapeutics will have to give place to energytherapeutics as human body is a bundle of jumping leptons and correction of sucherrors will have to use energy scientifically. Many proven methods of energytreatment have been in vogue for eons in many alternate systems. One more reasonwhy energy methods are better is the speed with which one gets results withenergy healing methods. Whereas chemical message transmission happens at a rateof one centimeter per second, energy healing transmission happens at a rate of1, 86,000 miles per second! Most, if not all, reductionist chemical moleculesare alien to the human system and they are rejected by the liver in the firstplace. (The first pass effect that we teach medical students in pharmacologymeans that the body is trying to destroy as much of the drug as possible)The ghost of Adverse Drug Reactions, (ADRs) staring at our face as the biggestcause of death in modern medicine, could be avoided if we follow the holisticmanagement of illnesses to bring man back to his/her state of wellness asdefined above. Long live mankind on this planet in good health and happiness.Medical profession is always needed as the doctor is not just a drug vendor buta real friend, philosopher and guide in times of illness. In addition, sciencehas now shown that all the drugs or surgical methods that we use work mainlybecause of the faith the patient has in the doctor, the so called placeboeffect, also called the expectation effect (ee). A good doctor, humane andhuman, full of empathy, will be god to patients at all times. Basically, a gooddoctor should be a good human being. “If you want others to be happy, practice compassion.If you want to be happy, practice compassion.”~The Dalai Lama. Prof. B.M.

Lipton The Honeymoon Effect: A state of bliss, passion, energy, and health resultingfrom a huge love. Your life is so beautiful that you can’t wait to get up tostart a new day and you thank the Universe that you are alive. Think back on themost spectacular love affair of your life—the Big One that toppled you head overheels. For most, it was a time of heartfelt bliss, robust health, and abundantenergy—a first-hand experience of Heaven on earth.Everyone can remember a time when they were ‘head-over-heels in love’. Duringthis dream time of life our perception of the world expands and our eyes twinklewith delight. Our affection isn’t limited to our selected partner; rather we arein love with life itself and it shows. We take risks to experiment with our lifeexploring new foods, activities, clothes and way of being. We listen more, sharemore and take more time for pleasure. What seems hostile the day before becomesheaven on earth when we’re in love. We don’t even notice the aggressive driversthat irritated the heck out of us yesterday; today, we’re lost in daydreams andlove songs.The “Honeymoon Effect” experience is Nature’s premier elixir of life. Throughthe action of the nervous system, love is translated into physiology, releasingvibrations and chemistry that heal and regenerate the body. The joy andexcitement that comes with finally finding the person you believe is the love ofyour life fundamentally is not the result of chance or coincidence. Insightsfrom frontier science now reveal not only why and how we create the honeymoonexperience, more importantly; they also provide a fundamental understanding asto why the honeymoon experience disappears. Knowing how we created the honeymooneffect and the reasons why we lose it, offers an opportunity to create theHeaven on earth experience every day of life, ensuring an unbelievablehappily-ever-after relationship, which even a Hollywood producer would die for.The honeymoon effect represents the successful fulfillment of a primalbiological imperative. Biological imperatives are the behaviors of livingorganisms that assure their personal as well as their species survival. Examplesof biological imperatives include the quest to secure water, food, safety, andmates. Imperative behaviors are unconsciously driven by cues provided by thebody’s physiology. When observed on the conscious level, imperative behaviorsare personally experienced as the urges or “desires” that shape our actions.Our physiology not only initiates imperative-directed behaviors, it also informsthe organism as to how well it is satisfying those needs. In assessing anorganism’s behavior, the nervous system releases certain chemicals thatencourage the pursuit of supportive behaviors and releases a different set ofchemicals to discourage organisms from engaging in threatening behaviors. Ournervous system translates the body’s positive and negative chemical signals intoexperiential sensations that range from pleasure to pain.The more an individual’s behavior supports their imperatives, the more pleasureand health they experience in their lives. In contrast, based on the severity infailing to meet imperative needs, one’s experience can range from simplediscomfort to excruciating pain, and even to death. Organisms that succeed insatisfying their basic drives are described as adaptive; those falling short areby definition, maladaptive.Most of the imperative-directed behaviors we engage in on a daily basis arerequired for our personal survival. However, to achieve the fundamentalimperative of species reproduction, it necessitates that we engage with others.For lower organisms, successful reproductive behavior may be nothing more thanbeing in the right place at the right time. Female starfish releases cluster ofeggs into the sea, and in response neighboring male starfish reflexively shedtheir sperm in the vicinity of the eggs. Voilà, reproduction-imperativefulfilled. Primitive organisms, such as starfish, need not attend theirfertilized eggs, and each egg will produce an individual that is self-sufficientfrom the moment it hatches. Simply, there is no need for parental care.However, as one ascends the evolutionary ladder, the creation of “viable”progeny for higher organisms requires much more reproductive involvement thanthat necessary to bring sperm and egg together. As species complexity increased,it led to the birthing of individuals that require an extended period ofgestation as well as a longer duration of postpartum nurturing before they areable to survive on their own. This is especially true for humans, whose infantsnecessitate an extended “education” and behavioral skills to enable them tosurvive and to prepare them to be effective parents for their own offspring.Nature’s design for human successful reproduction is optimally effective ifcouples maintain a loving relationship for a period lasting about twenty years,and that’s if they only have one child. To encourage such long-termrelationships, evolution designed the brain to release a cocktail of lovepotions that reward and encourage honeymoon-bound participants. The experienceof falling in love is derived from the secretion of neurotransmitters thatprovide us with, among others, ecstatic pleasure (dopamine), enhancement of ourattraction and attractiveness (vasopressin), exuberant health (growth hormone),and a desire to bond (oxytocin).To further cement relationship longevity, Nature slips a mickey into thecocktail, by controlling serotonin, the hormone associated with addiction. Oncethe honeymoon effect is experienced, the brain chemically addicts us to pursuethis behavior. This addiction is win-win for both the lovers and for humancivilization as well, because of the healthy progeny they leave behind. Ofcourse, the downside of the addiction is the painful depression and withdrawalsymptoms experienced when love and the underlying reproductive imperative fail.Body chemistry in lower organisms is the primary director of what areessentially reflex-driven and unconscious reproductive behaviors. Whileneurotransmitter chemistry is also an important motivator for engaging humanreproductive behavior, evolution endowed humans with agame-changer—consciousness and freewill. Though reproductive behavior is stilldriven by physiology, what we ultimately experience and what we create with ourreproductive imperative is under the control of the mind.As fully expanded upon in my book, ‘The Honeymoon Effect: The science ofcreating Heaven on Earth’, to understand how we create the honeymoon effect andwhy it disappears requires that we differentiate between the mind’s two primarysubdivisions, the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Each mind possessesunique powers, and their interdependent cooperation shapes our life and loveexperiences.The conscious mind is the seat of our personal identity, the “home” of ourspirit, our uniqueness. The amazing power of the conscious mind is expressed inits creative ability. The conscious mind is the processor that manages ourwishes, desires, and aspirations. When contemplating what you want from yourlife, the answers are derived from the activity of the creative conscious mind.And a fact that becomes profoundly important is that the conscious mind is nottime- bound; it can “think” into the future, review the past, or just disconnectfrom the moment as it processes thoughts in our head.In contrast, the subconscious mind is a massive super computer, one milliontimes more powerful than the conscious mind that contains downloaded stimulus-response behavioral programs known as habits. Though the subconscious mindpossesses a little creativity, it’s primarily function is to record and playbehavioral programs it acquires from genetics (instincts) and from “learned”life experiences. The subconscious resembles a record–playback device, such as avideo camera. Record a behavior and every time the play button is pushed, thenervous system recreates the same behavior, no “thinking” or conscious awarenessrequired.Operating from the conscious mind, our cognitive activity and behavior arecontrolled by our personal wishes and desires. However, when the conscious mindis preoccupied with creating the future, reviewing the past or just busy“thinking,” it is not being mindful—paying attention to the current moment. Atthese times, behavioral control is automatically defaulted to the subconscious,loaded with prerecorded programs.If our minds truly control our life experiences, why are we not manifesting“Heaven on earth?” Science’s answer is profound and empowering, for it explainshow we create the honeymoon and why we lose it. Neuroscience reveals that theconscious mind only controls about 5% of our behavior and responses to life.During the remaining 95% of the time the conscious mind is engaged in“thinking,” and by default, life is then controlled by the subconscious mind.Simply, the wishes and desires of the conscious mind only control our decisionsand behaviors about 5% of the time. The remaining 95% of our lives, essentiallyall of it, is under the control of prerecorded behaviors in the subconsciousmind.The greatest impediment in creating Heaven on Earth is that the primarybehavior-controlling programs in the subconscious mind do not represent ourwishes, desires and aspirations. Our subconscious behaviors are primarilydownloaded by observing other people—parents, siblings, extended family andculture. A child can only become a contributing member of a society after itacquires the thousands of rules and behaviors that govern participation. Naturefacilitated this need by designing the human nervous system to accommodate amassive download of data between birth and seven years of age. During thisperiod, a child’s brain predominately expresses theta activity as assessed usingelectroencephalography (EEG). Theta activity, associated with a child’s state ofimagination, is the operating frequency of a brain in hypnosis.The child’s mind in hypnosis not only records other people’s behavior; it alsoacquires a “self-identity” by down loading other people’s opinions as to whothey are. Psychologists acknowledge that a majority of the downloaded behaviorsand perceptions of “self ” are disempowering, limiting and self-sabotaging.These conclusions are profound—the conscious and subconscious mind, togethershape our reality. Consequently, a relationship is based on four minds, twoconscious minds and two subconscious minds. The question is which of these mindsis running the show? On a daily basis, the subconscious behavioral programsacquired from others control 95% of our lives. It is important to emphasize thatbecause the conscious mind is busy in thought during this time, we rarelyobserve our own behavior, especially when we are “shooting ourselves in thefoot” and sabotaging relationships.Then how do we create the honeymoon effect? Science has now observed that theconscious mind of people in love does not wander but stay in the present moment,becoming mindful. This means that during the honeymoon period, the participantsare controlling their behaviors and actions using the wishes and desires oftheir conscious minds. Think of it this way, when you are that much in love, whywould you let your conscious mind wander when everything you wanted is right infront of your eyes. The result is a honeymoon experience of Heaven on Earth.The problem that arises for most is that “real” life inevitably intrudes intothe honeymoon. The conscious mind drifts off into thoughts about paying therent, fixing the car, doing the chores. At these times the behaviors expressedand the responses made to partners are not governed by your conscious wishes anddesires, they are now controlled by the mostly negative behaviors acquired fromothers. These newly exposed subconscious behaviors were never part of thehoneymoon experience, but as they intrude into the relationship, the glowdisappears. As more and more, formerly unobserved and negative subconsciousbehavioral traits are introduced, they continue to compromise the relationship,sometimes to the extent that the end result is a divorce.With insight and awareness, limiting subconscious programs can be rewritten.What would be the consequence of rewriting negative subconscious behaviors andreplacing them with your wishes and desires? A honeymoon effect, that will keepyou healthy, joyful and living in harmony the “happily ever after!” way.Bruce H.

Lakhwinder Babbu Gill Life is simple and easy. All That I need to know At any given moment is revealedto me. I trust myself and I trust life. All is well. ~Louise L Hay The Turning PointThe party is in full swing, with music and laughter, some one tells a joke andeveryone laughs and someone’s laughter is even funnier than the joke!The pudding is being served, a mango soufflé and a lady beside me declines thepudding saying she is allergic to mangoes. I am surprised and I say to her---“It’s all in the mind.” Another lady sitting beside me turns around and asks,“Do you practice mindfulness?” And a little puzzled, I ask, “what’s that?” Thisquestion brought a momentous change in my life. She mentioned a center nearby atIgatpuri that taught mindfulness and Vipassana meditation and suggested I go andcheck it out. It was the month of June 1988, and I lived in an Army Cantonmentnamed Devlali, in Maharashtra with my husband and children. Her suggestion cameat a time when I was at an all time low in my life. My health was a concern, andmy relationships were just not working. I was lonely and sad. I needed abreak... I needed to go someplace... And this was the perfect answer. A retreatin silence for 10 days!Promptly with my husband and my mother in law, we drove off to Igatpuri, tocheck this center out. The rest is like a dream come true. I fell in love withthe sheer beauty and serenity of this place, a haven on earth, the place where Ibelonged. The management agreed to take me in as a walk in for the 10-day coursewithout prior registration (very unusual). Happily I stayed back; I had goneprepared with my bag and baggage. This was the turning point in my life and eversince that retreat, there has never been any looking back, and life has neverbeen the same.The Divine GiftFor many years much has been written on the mind, body and spirit connection andof late there is so much information available, I will share my simple yetprofound experiences.“Sometimes when things are falling apart,they may actually be falling into place.”I can recollect many childhood instances and stories. I have always beenintuitive. Before I share these stories, I will preface it all with the factthat I was born to parents who loved me dearly. As I share my experiences attimes it may seem that they were unloving but it was completely unintentional.My parents did their best then with the understanding, awareness and knowledgethat they had at that time. Children do not come with an operating manual.As I mentioned earlier, I have always been very intuitive, and somehow whateverI said usually manifested and came true. I was nicknamed- ‘Bahen Nanaki’ (GuruNanak Dev Ji’s sister). I was blessed to have been born on his birthday. As alittle girl, I often spoke with wisdom, beyond my years and whenever I did, myolder brother and sister would tease me with ‘Nanki...Nanki’. Soon I grewconscious of every word I said and with time I lost my self-expression. Sadly, abeautiful name became unacceptable for me. Soon I began to paint and make pencilsketches and by the age of 6yrs I was expressing myself through my drawings,making the most beautiful portraits of people around me! I was born a blessedand gifted artist. Thank you Universe.I remember sitting with beggars and distributing biscuits as a toddler.Traveling in a car and predicting an accident, and seeing it happen then andthere! Predicting my father’s promotion all at the age of four and having a neardeath experience at the age of 13 are some of my memorable experiences thatconfused and frightened me. My mother was always fearful of what I may see andutter. Amongst the 4 siblings I was my father’s favorite but for my mother, Iwas the unwanted girl child (that’s the story and belief I grew up with).I grew up sensitive to other people’s opinions and prejudices and all theirnegative messages became the truth for me. By the age of 10 years, I was awkwardand thin and my French teacher, who also was also our music teacher, never lostan opportunity to remark, “You’re too tall and gawky for the school choir.”Relatives often compared me with my very fair family, “who does she look like?Her color doesn’t match any of you!” I grew up as an angry child with low selfesteem who could never rise up to her mother’s expectation and I embedded thebelief that I am not good enough and am unwanted and an unloved girl child. Mylife turned into a race always trying to prove my worth! I was sickly and I soonbecame asthmatic.I got married at an early age, ready to start a new chapter in my life. I was asuccessful, creative and gifted artist with a design house and art studio of myown, two adorable sons and a loving and supportive husband. Despite all this, Ihad this emptiness inside me. This hollow feeling I never understood. A searchfor something I did not know. I grew up with my share of bruises and challenges.RealizationHow my life’s new journey began is very simple, yet powerful. Every challengethat I faced thereafter was an insight with a reminder that “Life is NOW”. I gotinitiated into meditation. On the very first day at the center, rushing up to myroom, carrying my heavy bags, I sprained my ankle. My first insight ‘Slow downgirl, take it easy!’ I had to share my room with an elderly lady who snored asloud as a thunder. I complained and requested that my room be changed but I wasasked very gently to be tolerant and accepting. Second insight came that ofacceptance, giving up judgment and criticism.On the first day stick in hand and a bandaged ankle, I limped to the meditationhall as fast as I possibly could, the hall was full and as I couldn’t walk up tothe front easily, I took my cushion and sat at the end of the hall at the back,just next to the entrance at the doorway. I was always a ‘first row’ personsitting right up in front always. This back end, last seat just didn’t work forme at all. I didn’t have a choice except to be patient and calm and to surrenderto the situation. This seat of mine near the entrance turned out to be ablessing. Each time the teacher and guru ji went past me, they would raise theirhand in Aashirwad and bless me with ‘Maitri’.As the course progressed for the next 10 days, there wasn’t a moment that wasn’tnew to me. My Asthma came up during the first session, flashes of childhoodexperiences flashed through my head. All the suppressed tears, smothered loveand pent up emotions arose. The rejection of being an unwanted girl child waspainful, the anger and resentment all welled up. The feeling of being unlovedwouldn’t let me breath until the floodgates broke open and all the buriedemotions were released and finally set free. I could see and experience howevery thought created a feeling and an emotion and I could experience everysensation at the physical level! Every moment was a moment of arising andpassing. Yes, it is here that I experienced and understood the Mind, Body andSpirit connection for the first time in complete awareness.Life has never been the same ever since that summer in 1988. I released myselfof pain and suffocation and have never had another attack of asthma in theseyears. I saw the need in my consciousness that had kept me stuck all my life,the need to get noticed and to be heard that created this condition.There was no need NOW in my consciousness for this dis-ease. I took charge of mylife. I chose to move from being a victim to a place of power. In my willingnessto change and forgive, I set myself free. Never to have another attack ofAsthma, ever!I have been meditating, observing in silence, and expressing my gratituderegularly to the power that created me. I have also been very fortunate to havemet SN Goenkaji, my true guru and teacher in a personal meeting and done a fewVipassana courses with him. He is the first person who showed me the truemeaning of unattached service, to surrender and just go along with the flow. Bethe flow, being present every moment, being mindful of every thought and everysensation arising and passing. I continued this practice at home. I began to seethe world with new eyes. Every thing around me was just the same, the peoplewere the same, but I had changed. My relationship with myself had changed. I hadaltered. I experienced the true meaning of responsibility for everything thatoccurred around me. I realized the value of moving beyond blaming others. Thatis the bliss of living in the NOW.People and resources began to appear on my path that would assist me in healingthose wounded parts of myself. I accepted a world of self-discovery, self-loveand healing. With this divine surrender, my new journey of self-love and self-acceptance emerged. The connection between the mind and body and the effect ofmy thoughts on my feelings and sensations intrigued me. As my practice inmeditation went deeper, my search for more knowledge and understanding in thisfield grew as well. I began to read almost everything that spoke about thisconnection; books, articles, magazines and I began to journal my thoughts. Booksbecame my best companions. I could spend hours in a library or a bookstore!This is one of my favorite quotes-“I love walking into a bookstore. It’s like all my friends are sittingon shelves waving their pages at me.” -Tahereh MafiLooking back now, this journey has been not easy. Every challenge that I facedwas a life lesson that I needed to learn. My family was happy that I was not‘sick’ any more, yet they were a bit confused with what I had become! I hadchanged, for I was not the Babbu they knew and I am so happy and grateful forthis change! My life was truly beginning to feel good. It is during this processthat I first saw the little blue book written by Louise L Hay. It had been leftat a bookstore in Devlali by a foreign student officer for sale. The slim size,easy to read pages and the name, HEAL YOUR BODY attracted me. This wonderfullittle book (now my sacred treasure) answered a number of questions that arosein my practice of introspection and meditation.As Louise L Hay says-“We want to know what is going on inside us, so we can know what to let go.Instead of hiding our pain, we can release it totally”.When I first read this statement in Heal Your Body, “It’s only a thought and athought can be changed” I never understood it. I never understood that if I waswilling to change my thoughts I could change my life! Now I am aware and I knowthat every thought creates a feeling and emotion. Every thought, determines whatI say and what I do. Every thought determines how I feel and that determines mybehavior! I now understand that my thoughts create my experiences, my realities.Happy thoughts give happy feelings and unhappy thoughts could create feelingsand emotions of sadness, anger, fear, guilt and resentment.Louise L Hay’s philosophy gave language to my silence and introspection.“Your cells are programmable and instantaneous” -Bruce Lipton. His words keptringing in my ears after I heard him in a conference in New York. Along thishealing journey, I made beautiful friends. Today some of my clients have becomemy greatest teachers. One among them is my husband and soul mate Iqbal, who hasencouraged me from the day we touched each other’s life. He has showered me withlove, generosity and unconditional support in this journey of self-love andhealing.After individual counseling with clients and conducting workshops and severaltraining programs I have realized that love and forgiveness are the greatesthealers. Being a Vipassana Practitioner, and trained in Louise Hay’sphilosopher, as a teacher and Life Coach, I now have the ability to givelanguage to my experiences and expression to my silence with love andcompassion.There is only one thing that heals every problem, and that is: “Loving Yourself” and the willingness to trust the power that resides within each of us. Thepoint of power is always in the present moment.“A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.” ~James KellerDo not allow people’s opinions and prejudices to dim your lights. Let YOUR lightshine. Our light brings light to others.It wasn’t until I was in my 40s that I learned part of the answer! And it wasn’tuntil my late 50s that I really began to put that learning to use. I learnedthat other people in our lives are a reflection of how we feel about ourselves.By consciously or unconsciously believing that we deserve to be treated in acertain way, we attract people and situations into our lives that validate ourbeliefs about ourselves and this belief of undeserved-ness begins when we beginto accept the statements and actions of others as our own truth. Have younoticed how small babies are? They believe they deserve every thing, a toy or tostay up till late? They have not yet accepted someone else’s truth about theirdeserving-ness. Then sometime in school someone told us we weren’t good enough;maybe a parent, maybe another classmate, or a teacher and we accepted that truthas our own. We made a choice to accept someone else’s truth as our own truth.Once this belief takes hold, it spreads on other area of our lives.“Average human has approx. 80,000 thoughts / day out of which 98% are negative.Like “I am too old” or “I’ll never get ahead” or “I am too fat” etc.Self-criticism will lock us into the patterns we are trying to change.A belief is only a thought, and a thought can be changed. It would be muchbetter to say “I am always doing the best I can” or “you are really smart atgetting things moving”. I am encouraging you to initiate a habit of choosingthoughts and ideas that support feeling good and powerful, that elevate you to ahigher level of Consciousness.”~ Dr. Wayne DyerWe have been criticizing ourselves for years, try complimenting yourself,nurturing yourself, LOVINg yourself exactly as you are, Right NOW.Affirm this in the mirror.”I love you exactly as you are” Or “I am lovable andworth loving”. Keep repeating as often as you can. You may use your phone cameraas a mirror. Love others exactly as they are, and they are free to change!We are selective about the drugs we take, careful, for we know that they couldhurt us. Yet are we nearly as careful about the thoughts that we put in ourminds?What is the most powerful medicine we have for healing the thoughts that causethis long list of symptoms? It’s called- FORGIVENESS.Release The PastLove can heal the world, and forgiveness is the catalyst to make it happen. Inaddition to loving ourselves it is important to release the past. We cannotchange our past, yet we can create our present and our future. If our thoughtscreate our reality and the way we experience our lives and our physical bodilyexpression of life then our current experience is the result of the thoughts andbeliefs from the last minute the last hour, the last day, the last week, thelast year.When there is distress or imbalance in a relationship, start with forgivenessJust be WILLING to forgive. Remember forgiveness starts as a CHOICE, not as aFEELING. Forgiveness is the greatest gift you can give yourself. Our immunesystems become stronger when we forgive. It is the first step to freedom.GratitudeLove and forgiveness have seen me through an Ischemic attack, released me ofasthma and saved me from a breast surgery. I am grateful!I am grateful for my breath, that keeps me alive, my parents for being my firstguides; my loving sons for the joy I experienced in raising them, my family andfriends for always being my support; my teachers and my gurus for making myjourney simpler, by showing me the light. Life is simple and I believe that.Simple secrets for an Inspired LifeLove and Respect yourself, for “what you give out comes back to you.”-Louise LHayBecome aware of the importance of relationships. Relationships are thefoundation of life.Stay Inspired. Use tools like making positive affirmation in the mirror. “Placeyour orders in the Cosmic Kitchen”, as my coach and mentor, Patricia. D. Cranealways says -It is a YES Universe. What you ask, you WILL get. Practice positive affirmationswith persistence.Meditate and listen to your heart and your body. Practice stillness in silence.Stay inspired. Inspiration is the joyful voice of your intuition fullyexpressed.In giving we receive. Service is about giving of self, helping others, beingkind and compassionate and making a difference.Create a daily affirmation, a prayer or pledge, to help you connect with yourvalues and your vision. Post them and paste them, where you can see them to keepyour inspiration alive.Here are some of the physical problems my clients have been able to move beyondby just loving themselves and forgiving themselves and others. Depression,Insomnia, Aches and pains, Stomach aches and ulcer like symptoms Headaches, Backaches, Just to name a few. I myself healed my asthma only through love andforgiveness.Our immune systems become stronger when we forgive.“Refuse to allow any thoughts based on your past to define you.”~Dr Wayne DyerLakhwinder Babbu Gill is a Vipassana practitioner since 1988. Mindfulness is anintegral part of her life. With a perfect blend of the east with the west, shehas used Louise. L. Hay’s philosophy to give language to the insights shereceived in the silent practice of meditation. She discovered and experiencedthe magic of love, the power of forgiveness.

Thanks to a group of friends who werelovers of the esoteric. We dared to experiment and document our success andfailure stories. This was more than a decade before the documentary “The Secret”by Rhonda Byrne made the world aware of “The Law of Attraction”. At that time Iwould not know that many years later I would be taking a workshop “SankalpaSiddhi- eastern Law of Attraction”.Logic will take you from A to B, but Imagination will take you everywhere.-Albert Einstein (The world’s greatest scientist)I believe that the greatest Human Power is The Power To Create. We all have beendoing this unconsciously day in and day out. When I looked at our Sacred Texts,I was stunned by the revelation that the Universe too used this techniquebillions of years ago. It is said that the Universe was in an Un-manifestedstate (Shiva State). Maybe it was a rather boring state with Nothing but PureConsciousness. A thought or a Flash happened; the world got created with a BigBang. The Un-manifest energy created the manifested visible world (ShaktiState). Wow, the whole Universe Just Manifested. So this technique is as old as13.8 Billion years.When the human beings evolved, the Universe was benevolent to hand over thissame power to us. No other species had access to this Power. From then on wekept on creating. This great Power has created everything that you see in thisworld. The huge mountains, the gorgeous waterfalls, gigantic forests, theanimals, birds, bees and butterflies all created by The Universe using thisTechnique. Powerful cars, speed jets and airplanes, fast trains, huge ships,modern technology gadgets were created by the human beings using this power.Welcome to this Awesome Power waiting to burst out from inside of you.All of you would want to discover your life purpose, find peace, have greatrelationships, super careers, be able to afford the best of products, attractmoney, feel vibrant health, look young, or be spiritually connected. Thesetechniques could help you to have an authentic empowered life.“Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions.Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character.Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.”Lao Tzu (world’s greatest philosopher 2500 years ago)Rather than talking about theories let us get into the techniques directlyThe Power of ImagesImages are the language of the sub-conscious mind. A picture is worth a 1000words. They are images, pictures, videos, symbols, and anything that is Visual.A very large part of our brain is devoted to processing images. We have beenusing this since cave times. The world’s greatest be it scientist, architects,sculptors or artists were all good in their visualization. They could rapidlysee images inside them and simply gave life to them. So if you want to Poweryour Dreams, you should be good with Imagery. When you close your eyes, theimages should feel real. You must have heard that “things are created twice,first in the mind, then in real”. Not only you should be able to create images,but you should be able to move them 360 degrees, you should be able to play withimages- make them big or small, make them bright or light, make them colorful orblack and white etc. This needs years of practice and skill.So let me share a secret, which will truly help you in doing this. Start withvisuals from outside. Imagine you want a car. First be clear about the brand ofthe car, the color you would love and other details. Take some effort and find arich image (this is the most important step) maybe from the showroom and hang orpaste it in a place where you can see it often.See it minimum of two times a day, once in the morning because in the morning weare in an altered state of mind, which is the most resourceful state formanifesting. See it once more in the night just before going to sleep. The imagegoes deeper into your sub-conscious while you are sleeping.Let us look into images and its practical use for ManifestingWant to Attract a Life Partner-• Remove all images, which depict One- Single lady, single bird, single horseetc.• Substitute it with images, which represent Two -Two lovebirds, a happy couple,Radha Krishna, Rama Sita etc.• Remove a single bed and substitute by a grand double bed.• Use the Color “Pink” in some wall of yours, preferable the bedroom, or pinkupholstery.• Get a Rose Quartz, which is a crystal that enhances Love.• Always keep yourself surrounded by Red Roses• Listen to Love Songs.• Each day make an attempt to meet happily married couples.

Life becomes easy. Things are created twice, first in the Mindthen in Reality. In this game you have to win in the Mind before you win inReality. The whole of the Indian System worked on Mind Mastery- creatingpowerful states within the mind.

It was the second time that I met him, and this time was in 2010. Itwas a big gathering and there were lots of people, but at the end of the meetingwe were permitted to ask questions. There was not much time left, but theassistants said they would choose two or three questions to pass forward.I had a friend who was visiting me, and he was going through a tough time. Hewas suffering from intense self-loathing, and I admit I was also a bit worriedthat he was may be having a real problem with some kind of a substance abusethat he wasn’t admitting to.So my question was: “How does one best help somebody if they are battling withlow self-esteem and beating themselves up? what’s the best thing that one can doto be of assistance?”Of course I was asking this question as a friend caring about a friend, and alsobecause being a counselor… this is something that I often have to encounter inmy work. But there is a difference between a person coming for professionalcounseling and someone simply approaching a friend – then one cannot necessarilyvolunteer assistance, unless the friend is asking for help. I was lucky enoughthat my question got passed forward, and the following was The Dalai Lama’sreply: “The first thing that you need to know is that even if Buddha himselfcame down to assist you with someone. If that person themselves is un-willing toheal, then there is really nothing that can be done to help them.”I can admit at the time, although his message was clear, I was slightly heartbroken. I thought “That doesn’t help”, but I really got the strength of themessage about how important it is in any kind of healing, or getting over anykind of fight, whether it’s a minor problem or a major illness - that there isthe reality and essentially it needs our own willingness within that healingprocess.The welcomed dichotomy…It was soon after this meeting I had just begun to facilitate large groups ofworkshop participants, and this was always in the back of my mind... thiswillingness.I began to observe in the workshops, that within the truth of those words of HisHoliness that day - was also gifted a beautiful dichotomy, which is that theopposite is also completely true: When anyone really is willing… then healingcan happen, and fights can end, so rapidly that it can almost spin one’s head.I’ve seen people come to workshops and shift through and heal stuff that they’vebeen battling with for years and simply get through it within a matter of hours,just in their pure willingness of truly wanting to shift.Subsequent to this, I started to become genuinely driven by a desire to create a(new) way of conducting workshops. To be able to teach about psychology in amore accessible fun, light way…and so be able to assist people to find theirwillingness to get past any fight or problem.I was most interested in how to best assist any participant who turns up for aworkshop, so that they can tap into their own strength and innate willingnesswith ease.Embracing the new...The result, in 2011, was a new model for teaching, learning and healing calledThe willingness Process. It was the fast and effective results, and the poplarresponse to this model (that involves many interactive exercises and much humor- both essential, I find, for willingness) that led to the kind invitation tocontribute to this book. An honor I feel touched by, and reassured by, that thismodel does have some real merit.It excites me, as I know in practice that instigating willingness -in anyone ofus - does have a true effect and huge power.I am thrilled by the ongoing growth of this model, and of willingness in generalin our life time, because I know it really does not matter how much knowledge Imay have as a ‘therapist’ or speaker, (or any of us has as a doctor, teacher,friend or practitioner); it does not matter how much our friends may want tohelp us. And it does not matter how much we want to help someone in our family.That at the end of the day… it is up to each one of us, to tap into what itreally takes to genuinely shift past our stuff.Incidentally I am not saying that we all cannot be of assistance to otherpeople. We can all be of great assistance to all other beings. And particularlyof assistance to those of us who may be struggling with being willing to bewilling to assist ourselves.What we can learn from a humorous Dr. of Psychology….Here, I would love to share with you one of my favorite quotes by one of myteacher’s Dr. Chuck Spezzano who often jokes:“Men have two favorite forms of Personal Growth. The first is (well you canlikely imagine what the first is), and the second is when their partner takesthe first step forward for them.”How the seemingly impossible is possible…So often after a workshop, an attending participant will contact me…days or evenmonths later, usually to tell me something that most often reads like this:“Anyone would have sworn that my partner / my mother / my brother attended theworkshop too. I came home and they were somehow different, and the relationshipis just so much easier!”I love hearing these reports as it 100% confirms two things: One which is thelogic behind why it is so worth being personally willing to address an issue ora concern, and the other is a very simple scientific reason why this seeming‘miracle’ occurs. Being a lover of both logic and science - both reasons and theresults enthrall me. I will share these two reasons, in more detail later.Defining willingness…At this mid-chapter interim, I would like to share with you a definition of whatwillingness, in my own words, actually is. Willingness means: “To be aware ofand acknowledging of the heart - and so of life’s effortless ease - and then,actively participating in solutions and resolutions”.Now that does not sound too horrid or too off-putting does it?As here is where willingness stands alone as distinguishable from willpower andun-willingness. Exercising willpower and unwillingness usually both require hugeeffort, and usually a lot of strain and restraint. Willingness on the other handis much easier. And likely this is why it suits my (and perhaps your) personalnature. I know it suits me because I am essentially lazy, and anything thatrequires gigantic effort will always put me off! On the other hand anything thatis easy and has results - count me in!The best news here is… All it really takes to shift and speedily work throughany problem, fight, hurt, or dilemma (no matter how old that ‘problem’ is) isoften just a good dose of self-applied willingness.Discovering and uncovering your genius…Willingness I have observed is not only very innate within us all, but alsoinherent in every one of us. In fact, I have not yet met anyone who is not agenius and a living master…even if they do not yet know this about themselves.Your inherent genius and innate willingness is part of your essential nature.The only question that follows is: Would you being willing to explore and acceptthis, as possibly 100% true about you? It is an important question, asdiscovering this is a truth about you, it can and will instantly make your lifeso much easier.There is one catch though… exploring and embracing personal willingness willmake you stop all excuses, any repeating patterns and a plethora of old stories!Can you give that up? Can you face stopping your own excuses? Of course you can– you’re a genius!And, of course, you can and may still fall apart at times and fail at times -this is human - and part of accepting what it is to be human and not a god!Here is another question that may assist you in deciding:Are your ‘stories’ about what your life is like or was like… killing you, andyour happiness, far more than what your life actually is now and could be?”Whist we consider this, let’s talk about why when we genuinely embracewillingness and changes within ourselves… why others instantly, miraculously,appear to change and become more willing too:Exploring the logic, the EPR Paradox, andQuantum Entanglement…The first logical reason why others ‘miraculously’ seem to change, is becausewhen you / or I change (be it our thoughts, attitudes or reactions) then thosearound us literally have little to no choice but to change too...as they can nolonger relate with whom you were, but now have to relate to who you are!This is a great and empowering fast ‘game changer’ - that we all have the innateability to speed track into place.When we truly embrace changes within ourselves, then who we were is just nolonger applicable, and soon enough others do realize this… and their old way ofcommunicating with us either just does not work or - lets be more honest - wehave likely become a LOT nicer, clearer and easier to communicate with now.The scientific reasons why others (particularly those closest to us) do oftenchange, is simply due to the essential nature of all energy and all matter -energy and matter being one and the same thing really.This can be best explained by a discovery made by Albert Einstein and two of hiscolleagues in 1935, called the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox… andfurther expanded upon in 1997 (in a very surprising discovery highly discussedand published at the time) called Quantum Entanglement.I often discuss both of these discoveries in detail in workshops, and for nowhere is a brief laymen explanation of what these discoveries revealed:When two energies (in the case of the ePR paradox it was two protons, and inQuantum entanglement - two particles) have been in relationship with each other…and are then spilt apart within time and space - they appeared to still beenergetically (and seemingly telepathically) connected.In the subsequently then named ‘Quantum entanglement’ discovery, it was notedagain that: when the motion or the direction of the spin, of one of theseparated particles was altered… then simultaneously the other particle alsoshifted into exactly the same motion and direction. This happnedinstantaneously… every time they repeated the experiment.Einstein classically referred to this occurrence as:“Spooky action at a distance”It is worthy to note here that both science and most people, cannot be fooledi.e. We either change the direction of our thoughts or we do not. If forexample, you have not really changed your mind about how you view and perceive aparticular matter – do not be surprised if your mother / brother / or seeminglyto your ‘annoying’ neighbor does not appear to change - ever – either!So why not, rather, take a brave step forward with faith and science (I lovewhen they go hand in hand) and change your spin on life literally… and see whatwill and can amazingly occur. It is worth an experiment of checking it outanyway… even if you do so just to prove Einstein wrong. It won’t be the firsttime he has been challenged!I encourage you look up these discoveries further. Here is a reliable link: www.[http://www/] en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entaglementWhat learning, unlearning, and everyone can teach us…The following is what I know to be true - I have observed this within thousandsof hours of workshops and hundreds of hours on one-on-one counseling: Thathealing any problem, hurt, situation, story, or illness, is really simply aquestion of being 100% willing to be willing to do something - oneself - aboutit!One of my dearest friends – Noma Nontshinga – once said to me, post her singlehandedly assisting several refugees out of a war torn area into the safety ofSouth Africa; “Well someone had to do something, and my middle name just happensto be ‘Someone’.”I am not necessarily suggesting that you too run into war torn areas now, unlessyou want to. Yes - breathe a sigh of relief. As even just ending the possiblewar in our own homes is a wise and good place to start, to make a difference.When we simply choose to become more willingly proactive in our own (andtherefore actually everyone’s) healing, and not just be reactive to others andto life’s ups and downs - which let us be clear, will only keep us all (andlife) rocking all over the joint! And it won’t be an elvis jailhouse rock - morelike a “Do not pass go, do not collect 200, everyone go to ‘heartbreak hotel’jail. Where we all remain stuck - somewhere between a rock and a hard place!That does not sound like a fun house party to me!The first thing to know is - you are the key - and it would be just like you tovolunteer would it not? For if you are unwilling to take 100% responsibility andaccountability for the state of your own life and your own mind…why shouldanyone else take care of it?We are not really here to be each other’s mind keepers… we are here to be eachother’s cheerers, and at the very least what we can all do is ensure we come tothe table as stable and accountable as we possibly can be!Secondly: No one is ever past help - not even you, and not even her or even him.The only question is what are you going to do about it?Looking at life as a smörgäsbord…There is old wise story about life… that life is rather like a smörgäsbordboard, and we each have our own dish to bring to the table. We each have our ownunique spices, our own ways and our own secret ingredients that make our dishunique and delicious. My dish may not appeal to some people, but yours will. Sothe most important thing to remember is:When you don’t bring your dish to the table then someone on the other side ofthe table will go hungry, because they can only eat your dish. Someone else willstarve!So it is important that you bring what you have to uniquely contribute, as bigor as small as that dish may be - if it made love and a big heart that is allthat is required! It is in fact what you have come to do – it is one of life’sgreatest and most fulfilling purposes.As a facilitator, a lover of change, I find time and again that the more I tapinto my own willingness…and a willingness even to be 100% wrong about how Ithink or how someone else is, and what any present or past ‘fact’ appears to be- then others become more willing too!Embracing a willingness to be wrong…Herein is an important key to the huge transformation that being willing cangift anyone and everyone (including you)... Be 100% willing to be wrong.It sounds contra intuitive - but it is a gateway to seeing and experiencing new,easier, and faster ways through any upset.Think of it this way…the need to be right – all the time – is egotistical andrather unlikely! Unless you did write the Encyclopedia Britannica all on yourown, and even if you could – shhhhhhh!Being willing to be a life-long learner will not only enhance your own life –and others lives - it will also make us all not so annoying, more accessible andmuch more approachable.Being willing to be wrong, also open us up instantly to a pool of more geniusideas. Many ideas are discovered and uncovered by so many people. I am highlyexcited by the growing discoveries and even the wild ideas within our time.As an old but reliable saying goes. “Two heads are better than one”, and gettinghead isn’t half bad either! Yes – I just threw that in for the male readersamong us.What our friends and forefathers would say…And yes they would agree with the above headline.A friend of mine - Ruth Donald - calls a willingness to be wrong: Giving upthinking we might be the masters and commanders of the entire universe, and thatanyone else is. And it is what my father would call: Suspending all disbelief.Suspending all disbelief in others and in yourself in particular - will take youfar.There is an old African proverb that I love, that puts this perfectly. It goeslike this:“If you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to go far go with others.”Being from Africa here is some more African wisdom I would love to share withyou and it is very applicable if you do wish to embrace and access yourwillingness to transform yourself and the world.What we can learn from West Africa about willingness….There is a tribe in west Africa, called the Dagara, who have a very particularway of dealing with conflicts. Those caught in conflict are called forward tosit, facing one another, in the center of a large outside ash circle.The entire village community is then gathered to completely surround them. Whathappens next may not be what you would expect...First those surrounded are freely allowed to speak about what is going on in theconflict, if they so wish to share... and next (and this is the magic part) nolengthy discussions follow suite, no blame or judgments are made, no trial todiscern the “guilty” and “non guilty” ... instead the entire tribe simply beginsto sing about and directly to those trapped in their conflict.The songs are specific - and known by heart by every tribe member, of everyother tribe member.The songs on this day are about only those surrounded, and the lyrics speak onlyabout all that is noble within those individuals: Of their strengths, theiressence and their deepest nature. Of their many noted abilities, and gifts plusthe meaning behind their given names... their personal life purpose.I have been told by a transcriber of the Dagara rituals and tribe, that thisparticular ritual is 99.9% of the time hugely effective and transformative. Ifind it very easy to understand why!In my mind, I envision, an aftermath of two sobbing tribe members in the middleof the circle - touched with humility and care! I’ve always so loved this ritualof the Dagara Tribe!In my 18 slow years of studying psychology and my personal experience offacilitating larger groups I have come to notice again and again, that accessingand instigating true willingness is almost exactly like this above Dagararitual.Life changing willingness is about remembering who you are, and who everyone is- beyond our fights, beyond our borders, beyond our mistakes that we judge asun-dismissible and unforgivable.The only ‘problem’ is when we dismiss ourselves as collectively and individuallyunforgivable – then we end up missing out on our entire lives... Even sometimestaking our own lives and often taking the lives of others. Taking whom you, andhe, and she, and we all really came to be – friends and soul mates (not theromantic kind) the real kind... mankind interacting within and being in our fullpotential.In the real nature of willingness…as to the Dagara people ... any conflict, beit intra or inter personal is also always viewed as a message to the widercommunity and world, that there is also a larger communal conflict in play. Andso in reminding the individual of his/her own true nature, in turn each personwithin the tribe is reminded of his or her true nature and purpose.Embracing some ‘out-lawed’ learning…Malidoma Somë (a Dagara tribesman educated in America) speaks of the time hetold his elders about many of the law practices of The west. They wereparticularly bewildered and puzzled by the concept of people going to courts andsuing each other over a disagreement or a broken agreement. Somë writes thatafter a short debate amongst the elders themselves, they had only one questionfor him:“How, then - do these people ever learn anything?”The later catches us more than the former. We can forgive and forget, but can wetruly give up all judgment... and just learn?Can we catch that it is, possibly, only our judgments (be it of our selves or ofanother) that are demanding of us to conceive and perceive that forgiving isnecessary and required? Can we realize that to perceive that we must forgiveonly denotes that we have judged in the first place? I feel the deeper questionthen becomes, could we rather simply love others and ourselves to let go of ourbeliefs around the need to judge?Let us consider for a moment that responding to a mistake or an abhorrent actand being open to seeing beyond it; is not about conceding to the act, butunderstanding that responding with an equaled anger or violence - simply growsfurther abhorrence and more mistakes.In accepting that the act has occurred, and responding to that in a differentway... then assimilates a change, rather than perpetuates perhaps an ongoingproblem.Anyone who has been on the receiving end of TRUe forgiveness - knows this!And certainly everyone can understand this, even if there is huge resistance toit!And, yes I know some acts do seem so very unforgivable. And I am not condoningthose acts at all, I am simple saying when we truly wish to stop suchbehavior... A different response to those acts is required.Opening up to the power of non-judgment and defenselessness…You may find some of the following, challenging to adsorb, and perhaps howeverjust trust me - as someone who has been on the receiving end of what anyonewould perceive as an ‘abhorrent violation’ when I was a very young child (Yes -it was sexual. No it was not a family member), and I do not feel any anger aboutthat... So why, would you?I know this is a touchy subject for people, which is why I bring it up becauseit highlights so brightly where we draw our lines. “No that is the line, do notcross it!”Do we stop our own abilities to learn when we meet our lines? Are some of ourlines too short?Why do we have lines?Do lines not create, and invite predators? Does our defensiveness create ourfeeling of a need to defend ourselves?Is defenselessness rather.... the very best defense we could muster, and bebrave and wise and willing enough to just develop – fast?A question is... have I / you / we all matured yet enough to truly see thatdefensiveness and judgment just simply does not work?Are you /am I really willing to make a stand for change? Are we really willingto change ourselves or do we just want others to change?Are you willing to stop fighting in your own home first and foremost? Forget theMiddle East for a while, who are we to judge if we’re throwing chairs across ourown dining tables? Are we willing to stop fighting amongst our own families, ourneighborhoods and communities?Am I truly willing / are you truly willing to also stop seeing another as‘wrong’, and stop even perpetually punishing ourselves when we sometimes (quiteoften- if we are really honest!) get it ‘wrong’ ourselves?Does our guilt about when we get it wrong keep us trapped in a projection cycleof fighting and so not seeing and healing our own hurts?Whilst we consider all this…as yes I realize I have just perhaps jumped way intothe deep end of the pool with you... Let’s have a joke break. There is alwaystime for a good joke.OKA good joke break never goes amiss….So a builder goes into a bar and hears the most beautiful piano music. He saysto the barman “wow, where is that music coming from?”The barman points down to the end of the bar, and there sitting on the barcounter is a miniature man, sitting at a miniature grand piano - playing away.“He is amazing! where did you find him?” the builder asks.The barman points down to the other end of the bar, to a lamp.“You see that lamp” he says, “It’s magic. It will grant anyone who gives it agood rub one wish. I got that piano player!”“Wow, can I give it a try?” asks the builder.“Sure, go ahead! But remember you will only get one go!”Excited the builder rushes outside with the lamp and starts rubbing itfrantically. Suddenly millions of ducks start falling down from the sky. Thebuilder runs back into the bar for cover, looking really pissed off.“Hey this lamp is faulty! I wished for a million bucks, and a millions ducksstarted falling on top of me?”The barman looks at him and says, “Hmmmm, yeah I know! Do you really thinkI asked for a 10 inch Pianist???”I admit, every time I hear any piano music now, I think of this joke and Ismile!So... back to our conversation about willyness, I mean willingness.Facing our unwilling and stubborn sides…If you ever want to witness just how stubborn we all really can be... Just beginto take note of how un-willing you, I, and others can sometimes be at the verysuggestion of changing ourselves!We are, of course, quite willing to suggest and say, “Oh no, you first, pleasego ahead. It is after all you who has the problem anyway!”Even as a facilitator of willingness workshops, I too still sometimes get caughtin some of my own unwillingness at times. Yup, sorry not perfect!And when I do get unwilling... then beautiful life always gives me a good kickup the backside for forgetting that personal willingness is THE first key!A saying by one of my colleagues comes to mind: “A kick up the back side is, atleast, always a step forward”As much as we may kick and scream about how unfair that feels! And oh Yes we canall (definitely including myself ) have times may feel so very hard done by,(hold on where’s my hard done by hat?) And feel like we have to ‘do’ all thework only, always! (Hold on where’s my victim hat?)Yet, here is the irony…Don’t tell too many people though…Personal willingness IS actually the easy way,and it is so fast… that you will likely kick your own ass the next time forevereven thinking another may work faster!Sure for ALL of us (especially you) it would be so nice if others changed. Butfor that... are you willing to potentially wait for years /decades to passperhaps?If you are anything like me - you are also a bit impatient, so that route willjust feel a bit too deathly slow (and in time quite insanely stupid to have eventhought up).Facing the possible inconvenience…Because here is another inconvenient truth...And sorry to break this one to you,most especially if you are meeting me for the first time via this chapter, or ifyou know me well (and you may be about to think “hello you’re only sharing thiswith me now?”)... Sorry, and the news flash is-Have you ever, genuinely, considered deeply that it is quite possible that yourspouse / your neighbor / your brother... just may not want to change at all –ever? More especially not into the way you would prefer!What if they share with you that they are genuinely quite happy with anyone(including you) thinking they are a ‘pain in the ass’? That they do not give anass about that? It’s a free world after all! Then what??Are you then going to get caught up judging them, and in so creating a delay inyour own steps forward? Are you, yourself, then going to give up on creating ahappier, calmer, and more love-filled life?Or are you genuinely willing to halt ‘wanting others to change’, stopcomplaining about it, and just change yourself?Don’t miss a golden opportunity hidden it that conundrum!within all that drama, all that resistance, here is the fantastic news (hold onstop the trains) the most superb opportunity about simply being willing tochange yourself ...is then, remember 100% of the time, others have to changearound you. They have little to no choice, but to! As because you havechanged... others can no longer relate to you as to whom you were, but now haveto relate to who you are…and who you continue to become.The bottom line is... If you want another, or even the world to change (peoplelove harping on about that one, but I love the huge vision thinking of that!)...Then the very fastest way (avoiding blowing up the planet and starting all overagain) always has been, and always will be to change yourself. It’s not rocketscience really… it’s simply being willing to do what it takes to experience realshifts – fast!In conclusion:What Mother Nature and you can teach us all…To conclude to this chapter I would love to offer you one last story – this oneis about butterflies, and then I am flying out of here.When a butterfly is preparing to completely break free of its cocoon… it hasalready changed from a caterpillar into a butterfly, but it is not quite reallyyet. No one could do any service to it, in trying to assist it to ‘break free’faster than it is doing so on its very own.In fact, to do so will only injure it, or at least diminish its ability to fly,and in the worst-case scenario: we could even kill it in our hastiness to makeit transition at a speed we would prefer to see it change.Trust is a huge part of life. Trust that most of the time, we need not speedthings up. That, in fact, sometimes when we attempt to do so - we can kill whatwe wanted to nurture!The struggle for a butterfly to break free is exactly what prepares and empowersthat butterfly to one day fly with elegance, beauty, and great strength.Likewise… when living with yourself and with others - do not force anythingfaster than you or they can appear to move.Trust your life. Trust others. Believe in yourself. Believe in others! And thentrust again – that everything that has happened so far, for you and to anyoneelse - has happened, or is happening, at exactly the correct pace for you, andthem, to know how to truly fly one day.The even better news is… when we are on the cusp of change, breaking free of allour old constraints (both mental and practical) - change can, will and doesoccur very fast!There always comes a time in every butterfly’s life and in every human life -when left unforced that the end of all struggle becomes both inevitable andevitable.So don’t give up hope, and don’t force. Just allow and remember that everyoneyou see is a master, we just don’t all know that yet!The crystal key to all healing is very simply not to judge - not yourself – oranyone else! For we can either judge or we can help, but we can never to both atthe same time.Self-forgiveness ironically ends up being far more difficult than ever forgivinganyone else. Life asks of us to extend compassion to everyone – includingourselves!Truly feeling and extending compassion with, for, and to everyone is the heartform of deep willingness. Your heart and your willingness will always give backto you, and others, far more than it ever asks of you.without extending compassion all the time to everyone (again including toyourself ) - No matter what ‘story’ or ‘proof ’ wants to tell us otherwise - whywe could and should not be compassionate.And then we get stuck in thinking that some should suffer or deserve tostruggle, and some of us don’t. And we miss the very point of life - why we arereally here… to remember we are already whole, and that we all come from onesource. Even if we may disagree on what that one source is - it remainsunaltered that we all started at the same point at the beginning of all time.It is only when we forget this, and choose to judge each other (and ourselves)instead, we also miss out on the great mastery present and offered to us all, inany struggle.Dissolve all barriers of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, ‘us’ and ‘them’… and you willrelease yourself from all war (and the acronym for war, if you did not know thisalready, is: We Are Right)The butterfly does not fight to be right… it struggles only to break free of allits constraints. Just as we do as humans. Judge not the fight…simply watch andlearn.People often do huge service for us in showing us in which direction we do notwant to go. It may be hard to watch, but it is still a service for all toobserve, and all to learn from!Be patient with everyone. Everyone you ever meet is already a master, is alreadya son, or daughter or living being of one original source.We cannot ever really get it ‘wrong’, we can only sometimes be quite slow incoming to remember this! And time is irrelevant. Time as science has shown us,and mystics speak of, does not really exist.So breathe… Learn, allow, and let yourself fly…and in doing so you may besurprised how many around you also begin to experience flight.In conclusion, remembering only this… at heart, you are already perfectly wholeand innocent – as is everyone – and if you are willing to remember this, you areactually already flying.I wish you huge personal willingness, gigantic happiness, and nothing less!Jane Kirby is a qualified therapist, international trauma counselor, and thecreator of The Willingness Process modality.

Prayer is much more than areligious ritual and its essence when understood becomes the very purpose oflife itself. As Rumi says, “After all, the purpose of The Prayer is not to standand bow all Day long. The purpose is to possess continuously that fragrant statewhich appears to you in prayer.”We all pray and we all know how prayer brings solace, faith, courage andstrength to persevere in our aspirations and the challenges. Prayer when donewith consciousness can enlighten our life path and turn our mundane existenceinto a beautiful melody. Prayer is the most personal experience that we have; itis an inner journey and yet due to cultural conditioning, prayer is oftenreduced to perfunctory chanting or ritualistic worship.Prayer sets the stage for genuine healing. And when we truly learn how to pray,we never fall apart in life. Wisdom and love emerge and help take us on thejourney to full awakening. Prayer is an essential element of man’s divineaspiration to know the meaning of life and his own self. And prayer becomes aseeker’s first and last resort on this journey.As a child I used to do our religious prayers everyday and I did it quitereligiously for years, I asked for protection from nightmares, I asked for agood life, I asked for relief from my sufferings and the list went on. However,at some point, I realized that I never truly understood what genuine prayermeans and what the real focus of prayer should be. But with time I learned someprecious lessons about praying. It was through Sufi poetry and the works ofpoets like Khalil gibran and Rabindranath Tagore that I began to get a realclue.Though I have been praying every day, I never considered that prayer could actas a healing method until I came across Ho’oponopono. This practice and itsessence have changed my perception of prayer and today I use this practicewhenever I face any challenge. Not just that, I do Ho’oponopono even when I amcompletely fine as I find that it is the simplest way to return to your trueself. Ho’oponopono is a manifestation of the highest aspect of love and freedomthat we are, and its essence is infinitely inspiring.I am glad to share my perception of this wonderful prayer healing. In my lastsix years of experience as a holistic healer, I have worked with many people whocome to me with their problems including physical ailments, emotional traumas,painful life experiences or spiritual chaos. For many years I have used Reiki,EFT and sometimes other remedies like diet, music, color therapy etc. to helpthem, besides offering them counseling to shift their perspective.Having seen varied shades of human suffering both in my own self and throughothers I had a quest to understand and eliminate this suffering that ultimatelyled me to explore Non-Dual Awareness. However, it was as a part of this questthat I came to know this wonderful healing practice called Ho’oponopono to whichI was first introduced in one of the workshops led by my teacher Dr. Paula Horanfour years ago.I was amazed by the simplicity of this practice and its innate wisdom ofoneness; however I did not practice it much in the beginning. But when lost in adesert, you look for an oasis! And so it was that a year ago, I encountered aparticularly challenging life situation and I realized that I only had prayersto my aid. We normally take refuge in prayer when no physical action is possibleor effective in a situation. However with Ho’oponopono I realized that prayershould be the primary course of action as the insight revealed through it canlead us to take the right action, thus saving us from being erroneous in oureffort to resolve a problem.Ever since my own experience with this form of prayer healing, I am using itwith every patient and every time its benefit is verified sometimes throughmiraculous results and sometimes through revelation of much needed insight intoa problem. Whatever be the case, I feel Ho’oponopono is the dark horse ofhealing. A practice that looks too simple to be truly effective, but when donewith persistence and real presence, can open doors to true wisdom and love.I am sharing here a brief insight into Ho’oponopono and its various aspects. Asmuch of the general information is available through many resources, my focushere is to offer my perspective on this practice and how it can be applied andunderstood for the best result. Though my journey with Ho’oponopono has not beena long one, time never defines the expanse of an experience and so I feel thatdespite my not so old encounter with Ho’oponopono I can share some amazinginsights and healing experiences I received through this practice.The ProcessWhat is Ho’oponopono?Ho’oponopono is a prayer healing which has been practiced by the ethnic peopleof Hawaii. There are many different forms of this prayer healing which arepracticed across many Polynesian islands as well. We have seen how ethniccommunities rely on either natural elements or divine forces for healing andreconciliation and how shamans and priests play a great role in such communitiesoffering counsel and acting as a medium between the man and nature.Ho’oponopono has also been practiced in a similar way where a priest or elder ofthe family would offer prayer along with the members of the family for aconflict resolution or healing of physical illness. In traditional practice thehealing or resolution is also celebrated with a ceremonial feast. When studiedclosely we understand how wise and holistic the people of these ethniccivilizations are, as they truly understand the cause of suffering and work onit in a way that eliminates ego and isolation and brings our awareness closer tooneness. It is this very essence of Ho’oponopono which I admire and I often takerefuge in this prayer healing whenever I face a crisis and my awareness is underthe smog of suffering.The meaning of Ho’oponopono in Hawaiian is ‘mental cleansing’. Ho’o is similarto ‘To’ as it appears before a noun in english. And ‘pono’ is defined asgoodness, correct, well being, welfare, true condition or nature, righteous,just, beneficial, successful, in perfect order, accurate, relieved, necessary,eased, fair, virtuous etc.Ponopono is defined as “to put right; to put in order or shape, correct, revise,adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up, make orderly or neat”. Andthis is what any healing is focused at.The prayer comprises of four phrases: Please forgive me, I am Sorry, I love you,I thank you. Ho’oponopono is done by repeating these four phrases continuously,keeping the person or problem in mind. And this practice is done repeatedly fordays or weeks until the healing or resolution takes place.What looks like a simple chanting of some phrases has a profound effect whendone from a heartfelt space. And that is why it is important to understand thecorrect perspective you need to have while doing this practice, without which itwill only remain a superficial chant and one would not receive its benefit.Thus the right perspective is the core of this practice, because the prayer initself is simple and can be learned and memorized in less than a minute.However, what it takes a healer to work with Ho’oponopono, is the awareness fromwhich you send the prayers.History of Modern Ho’oponopono:Ho’oponopono in its traditional form was primarily used for reconciliation amongfamilies by the natives of Hawaii, by offering forgiveness, acceptance andgratitude in the form of prayers done under the guidance of a priest or a familyelder.Ho’oponopono as we have learned and practiced it today has come from MorrnahSimeona who is regarded as a healing priest or kahuna lapaau. Simeona adaptedthe traditional Ho’oponopono and applied it as both a general problem solvingprocess and for psycho-spiritual self-help. In accordance with the Hawaiiantradition she emphasized prayer, confession, repentance and mutual restitutionand forgiveness. However her application of the practice is also said to beinfluenced by her Christian education as well as her study of easternphilosophers and Buddhist influence which comes from the Chinese and Japaneseimmigrants to Hawaii which has also permeated Hawaiian culture.The first modern teaching of Ho’oponopono started with Pacifica Seminars foundedby Morrnah Simeona in Germany. After Simeona passed in 1992, her former studentand administrator Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored a book with Joe Vitale called‘Zero Limits’. The success of this book marked the entry of Ho’oponopono intothe western world. And since then this healing practice is spreading across theworld as millions of people experience its graceful impact.Dr. Hew Len has a very inspiring story of how he healed the inmates of a mentalasylum just by using Ho’oponopono perseveringly for 4 years. The result of hismagnanimous effort has been one of the most astonishing stories of alternativehealing. It was precisely this story that stirred my heart and propelled me tolearn more about it. I have found that just doing Ho’oponopono in difficulttimes brings my composure back within minutes.I recommend people read about Dr. Hew Len’s work to receive more insight intothe history and practice of Ho’oponopono.The Techniquewith any practice, if you understand the essence, you never go wrong in yourapplication. And it is the same with Ho’oponopono. The application is only anextension of the essence and thus in my own work I focus on delivering theessence of a practice in its entirety. In the same way, if you learn the basicsof car driving, you can drive any car with ease, if you learn the basics ofhealing you can utilize any healing practice to its utmost efficiency. AndHo’oponopono reflects the essence of healing in its simplest and most subtleform.The essence of Ho’oponopono is the manifestation of three key aspects ofuniversal love. These are –• Acceptance• Forgiveness• GratitudeUniversal love, which forms the very fabric of creation, from which all matterand spirit evolve, is embodied by these attributes of Acceptance, Forgivenessand gratitude. When we focus on these attributes and integrate them with ourfull acceptance of responsibility for whatever problem is occurring, we easilymanifest the universal love, which cleanses faulty patterns from ourconsciousness and fills us with awareness.Thus Ho’oponopono is not energy based, but consciousness based practice and thatis why it is devoid of any visual or energetic experience but it brings healingthrough awareness.Another key aspect of Ho’oponopono is that it helps us to cultivate responsibleLove. In his experience with the inmates of the mental asylum, Dr. Hew Len hasshared how it was not the inmates whom he healed; rather it was a part of hisown consciousness that had created the reality of the inmates, which he healed.This is very profound, because in truth, whatever we see in our environment is aprojection of our own inner imprint. And thus it is not the patient alone butthe healer as well, that needs the healing.While doing Ho’oponopono, the healer or the person doing it, needs to cultivatea loving acceptance and a sense of responsibility for the whole condition of thesituation. And then seek forgiveness from the imprints that cause it and offergratitude for the lesson and the final release.Thus, Ho’oponopono works at the very root cause of any suffering or disease,which is a false pattern or wrong imprint caused by our negative belief. Torectify this error in consciousness one has to first accept it, takeresponsibility to correct it, seek forgiveness for the error and be grateful forits release. This approach is what needs to be embedded in any healing practice,and that is why knowing and practicing Ho’oponopono elevates the understandingand perspective of a healer to a great degree.During my experience in the Core empowerment retreat with Dr. Paula Horan, Irealized the significance of responsibility in healing and spiritual evolution.Without taking full responsibility for ourselves and all of our actions, for ourlife and for everything that we see, hear and face, we cannot attain freedom.Escape is not the way to nirvana, owning up is.Ho’oponopono propels us to take responsibility not just for ourselves but alsofor others, as they are part of our own reality and thus not separate from us.This also points to the realization that Non-Dual awareness gives us; that weare the creators of our own reality and only by taking responsibility, can wechange reality for the benefit of all.Ho’oponopono like Reiki connects us to the source, which is not any force orentity outside of ourselves, but to our own awareness. The prayers are offeredto this source with request to correct what is not in place, to discharge thememories that create bondage and suffering.With this approach, Ho’oponopono also eliminates the feeling of ‘doership’ in ahealer. It frees the healer from attracting any ego identification and thus thepractice creates a more holistic awakening into greater awareness.Ho’oponopono also allows us to see the oneness in everything, and that isevident as we intend the healing toward the problem, encompassing it as our ownerroneous projection. When we integrate the love, forgiveness and gratitude inus toward the problem, we heal our internal projection of the problem and thusit changes the outer reality. It is beautiful to see how this practice dissolvesthe boundaries of inner and outer reality, of our self and others around us andgives us a glimpse of oneness.It is true that we all take refuge in prayer and it offers an anchor to ourfaith and gives strength. However many times the prayers in our daily routineare a form of pleading for desire fulfillment and the true perspective of prayeris not reflected in it. But Ho’oponopono immediately turns our attention towardawareness, toward universal love and a sense of oneness with all that is. Ourego identification then dissolves as we immerse ourselves in the prayer state.Some interesting experiencesMy first miraculous experience with Ho’oponopono happened after I parted wayswith a friend and was very upset, because we had not talked for more than aweek’s time. One evening after I finished my work, I was relaxing in my room andI thought about how I was contributing to the separation and not taking theneeded step to bridge the gap. Immediately I sat down and started praying. Ipoured my heart into that healing and surrendered to the emotions that came up.After sometime I felt light and I stopped. I resumed my work without wonderingwhat will happen. But within 5 minutes I received a message from my friend. Webroke our silence and the bitterness from the argument was erased. Slowly weresumed our friendship and the hurt feelings were repaired.Another incident happened when I was doing a Ho’oponopono session on a trainjourney. I prayed for various aspects of a problem to be healed, I prayed andprayed for two hours at a stretch and then relaxed. Suddenly I realized that myego had tricked me. While doing the treatment, I had looked down upon otherpeople involved and had a superior feeling and was directing the healing tohappen as I wanted it to be.A dark cloud of guilt loomed over my head and I was deeply disturbed. Two hoursof prayers were wasted and I wondered how much wrong I might have done insteadof creating harmony in the situation. I asked for forgiveness and prayed againand cleared my ego’s projection in the situation. I was relieved that I receivedthe insight to see this and rectify it. Ever since this incident, I am alwaysmore attentive to the thoughts and emotions that emerge during the practice.The fact is, we have little control over our thoughts and emotions and they comein accordance to our resistance to, or incompleteness of an experience. We thentry to fill the gap with our desired projections, however, this creates anegoistic barrier and the awareness of oneness and feeling of universal love goesmissing. It is important that we keep our identification in check and do notfall into this trap.A dear friend of mine, who had been going through a difficult phase in hermarriage, also had some amazing results with Ho’oponopono. She did the prayersfor her husband when he was in a very depressed state and she saw how he alwaysfelt better after the prayers and their fights ended in peace.Another experience I often have with Ho’oponopono is that as I begin, I slowlyfeel the pain and agony of the person or situation. As if I become that personand situation and I can see it from all aspects. This enables me to find outwhere prejudices are coming from and what is missing in the picture that iscreating the suffering in the first place. Sometimes it is difficult to dotreatments with such intense emotional immersion, however one always feels lightat the end and the calmness that comes is very healing in itself, as you feel adeep sense of resolution with the issue.I truly feel that by doing Ho’oponopono, although it looks very simple, it has avery profound effect on our awareness, if we do it consciously. Because it is aprayer with four simple phrases, it can easily turn into a mechanical, automaticaction if you don’t allow yourself to be present and become unconscious.The book ‘Zero Limits’ by Joe Vitale and Dr. Hew Len illustrates how by doingHo’oponopono, we go into a zero state with no identity, no memories and thus nolimits, a state in which we have infinite potential to manifest. This can beexperienced by practitioners as they refine their practice day by day.Ho’oponopono can be a great tool for healing however we should not expectmiraculous results in every session. Life has its own design and a treatmentsession done now, can show its effect in a future event. In cases where manyaspects are involved, it is suggested that the practice be continued for alonger period of time without seeking any immediate benefit. This is especiallyfor people who are facing severe life challenges and going through a verycomplicated crisis.In my view, Ho’oponopono complements the teachings of Non-Dual awareness andwhen integrated it can give even greater benefit and better understanding of thesubject matter as well. If done in unison, practices of Non Dual awareness andHo’oponopono can help us clear our Karma as well. As being aware allows us todisengage from ego identification and Ho’oponopono can help us complete ourunfinished karma by offering love, forgiveness and gratitude.I have always been in search of the most simple tools and teachings, as Ibelieve that simple is divine. Nature accomplishes most complicated tasks withthe simplicity of its design. Ho’oponopono, just like non-dual awareness issimple and grounded in the eternal principles of creation.Necessity in today’s timeHo’oponopono is indeed a necessity of our time as we are all facing a majortransition as many of our own shadows are being exposed to the light ofawareness, through the individual and larger chaos that we are all enduring. Itcan offer peace, composure and awareness to overcome each of the challenges thatarise. And because as a wise man once stated, “we are creating 97% negativekarma in every moment (even people with the best of intentions), it behooves usto constantly be clearing our karma every day.”Also as violence, natural calamities and other social and economic upheavals arerising; people can practice Ho’oponopono to bring peace to the environment. Itis said that the family that prays together stays together, and Ho’oponopono isthe most altruistic prayer to offer in service to that, which is divine in allof us. It is not essential that we do Ho’oponopono only when there is a problem.We can do it for peace and harmony to prevail on earth.Ho’oponopono reminds us of the eternal light of oneness. Its practice preparesus for our evolution where our existence reverberates with the energy of love,gratitude and forgiveness in every moment. It gives us the soil to sow the seedsof harmony and reap a life of grace and beauty.It is my wish that the essence of Ho’oponopono and its practice reaches allsentient beings and the source of endless love opens for all.Rashminder Kaur is a Reiki & EFT teacher and a student of Non Dual Awareness.Living in Ahmedabad, India, she offers healing and counseling services, andleads workshops to raise awareness in both social and spiritual domain.

Jacobson Forgiving others is an act of compassion. We know this. Nonetheless, oftentimeswe don’t do it. We want those who hurt us to suffer for what they did. Bywithholding forgiveness we think we are punishing them. We think we are keepingthem stuck in a prison of guilt and shame. But the fact is we’re just punishingourselves.We’re prolonging our own suffering. We’re withholding from ourselves our ownpeace of mind. We’re, essentially keeping ourselves locked in an emotionalprison cell that is of our own making. We victimize ourselves long after havingbeen victimized by our offenders.Anger Hurts, Forgiveness HealsAlthough anger has value as a signal device for survival, to alert us to dangerso we can respond appropriately, most of us hang onto our anger long after ithas served its purpose, using it to assault and manipulate those who have hurtus. Unfortunately, when we do this, we are hurting ourselves more than anyoneelse in the process.Anger deprives us of inner peace and joy. Anger diminishes our capacity to giveand receive love. Anger is hazardous to our health. Anger stimulates the releaseof stress chemicals that wear down our bodies. Anger raises blood pressure andincreases our risk of heart attacks and strokes. Anger depresses our immunesystem, makes us more vulnerable to diseases and cancer, and makes it moredifficult for us to recover from illnesses and injuries.Anger causes us to be emotionally imbalanced, sometimes to the point of makingvery impulsive, irrational, reckless decisions that have dire physicalconsequences for ourselves and others.Forgiveness decreases our anger, healing us emotionally and physically, it’s ano- brainer that the smart money is on forgiveness and that to hang onto angeris the real sucker play.There is absolutely no advantage to staying angry. We can take care of ourselvesand protect ourselves and our interests just as well, if not better, when we arecalm and non-reactive.If we understand the danger our anger alerted us to, we’ll know what to watchout for in the future for our safety and security, and we won’t need to continueattacking ourselves by hanging onto our anger. And so it behooves us toconsistently remind ourselves that anger hurts us and forgiveness heals us!When We Forgive Others We Free OurselvesForgiveness decreases our anger, our depression, our stress and our anxiety aswell. We sleep better. We have more energy. We’re more at peace with ourselves.Our general attitude is more positive, optimistic, hopeful and joyful.All of this maximizes our potential to attract people, places and circumstancesinto our lives, which will support us, synergize with our goals and propel ustowards the fulfillment of our dreams.Consequently, it is always in our own best interests to forgive everyone.Unconditionally. Without exceptions. Regardless of how they’re behaving or whatthey have done to us.What To Do When We Resist Forgiving Otherswhen we are having difficulty forgiving others, we focus on our blessings and onbeing grateful for what we have in our lives despite what has been done to us.This can take the sting out of any offense and make it easier for us to let goof our resentments in order to forgive.When we are having difficulty forgiving others, we remind ourselves that “butfor the grace of god go I,” that under other, less fortunate circumstances wemight have found ourselves in desperate situations doing unworthy and unlovingthings to others, out of fear and a belief that they were necessary for oursurvival.With humility, we remind ourselves that stressful circumstances can make foolsand devils of us all, such that good people do bad things, and, therefore, thatit’s best to put our harsh judge’s robe in the closet and don a cloak ofgraciousness, compassion and mercy instead.When we try to walk in another man’s shoes, to get a sense of the difficultieshe’s endured, how he’s been damaged in his life, and how he’s been programmedfrom childhood experiences to take and not give, to attack and not love, and towithhold and not share, it provides us with the opportunity to see the offenderin a more compassionate light, which then enables us to turn down the intensityof our anger over what has been done to us, and allows us to be more empathetic,and practice forgiveness.For example, if we know someone was abused as a child that can make it easierfor us to understand his or her bad behavior and forgive it. Along the samelines, if we’re aware of the current circumstances in the offender’s life, suchas being unemployed, having no savings, about to be evicted, with a wife and twochildren to care for, that can make it easier for us to understand why theybehaved badly, and to forgive them.It doesn’t mean we’re condoning or excusing their behavior, or suggesting theynot take responsibility for their bad actions. It just means that we’re choosingto see them from a more sympathetic viewpoint, and to let go of our criticaljudgments.Humanize Rather Than Demonize OthersIt can help us to forgive others if we perceive offenders as part of god,despite their ungodly behaviors. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, “we lovemen not because we like them or because their ways appeal to us or even becausethey possess some type of divine spark; we love every man because god loveshim.”If we don’t believe in god, we use other labels and tools to see the humanity inpeople despite the errors of their ways.It’s easier to forgive others if we can find some meaning, some wisdom, somebenefit born of the assault and the suffering we experienced. If we can do this,if we can find a way to learn and grow from what has happened to us, if we candiscover a blessing in disguise, our perspective changes, we feel less angry,less victimized and damaged, and it gives us permission, so to speak, to notresist extending our compassion and forgiveness.Ultimately, when we have difficulty forgiving others it is best that werepeatedly remind ourselves: “I forgive others for my own peace of mind.”When we are having difficulty forgiving others, we focus on our blessings and onbeing grateful for what we have in our lives despite what has been done to us.This can take the sting out of any offense and make it easier for us to let goof our resentments in order to forgive.Walter E.

In my opinion, the process requires the followingfive steps: -• Get Conscious of your story-The Consciousness• Deciding to what extent would you share-The Content• Turning wounds into gifts-The Cure• Look at tragedy as if it were comedy-The Comedy• Become a witness to your story-The ContextI have developed the above ‘5C framework’ to simplify the process and representit in a memorable and simple way. In the first step, we develop theconsciousness of our story and understand & trust that there is a gift behindall the pain and suffering in our life story. Once you get conscious about yourstory then only you can leverage its power in your life’s work (purpose or deeppassion).In the second stage, we take a well thought and conscious decision of how muchof the story to share and with whom (which depends upon our evolution, courageand social culture). We may share part of our story with the world, more of ourstory with a coach/counselor and keep a part with us, which makes us feel toovulnerable. This part can be shared too at the right time and can be healed bywriting or expressing in private (in a personal diary for example) till then.In the third stage we look deeper into our story to find the cure to our woundsby realizing that true gifts emerge from our wounds only. In the fourth stage,we shift our perspective and look at life as a drama and even tragedy as comedy.This shift of perspective further helps us in healing and unburdening our soul.In the fifth and final step, we understand that we are not our mind and body,but we are the awareness (or soul), which is watching the drama. This helps usin detaching ourselves from our life story and becoming witness or audience tothe drama of life and mind.Let us look at each step in detail now.The ProcessGet Conscious of your storyStart your journey with a reflection on, “What is the life riddle you are tryingto solve and how does this riddle relate to your own pain, suffering, andconfusion about the world?”Silence and contemplative practice are useful to connect with our deeper selvesand become aware and conscious of our story. Once I had posted on Facebook,“Passion is easy to discover but deepest passion requires deepest connectionwith self.” Silence is the best way to connect with our inner selves. It maytake time and effort but it is worth it because we come to know our deepestdesires, our life purpose and what do we truly want out of life. A clutteredmind or a pressured mind just running the rat race will never even find out whatits true desires were.Once your consciousness level goes up with regular contemplative practice, youhave more inclination for personal growth too. You will start looking within forthings gone wrong. You will realize that the locus of control is inside you andnot outside you. Spirituality says we write our own destiny with our thoughtsand actions. Once you start believing this, you will make an attempt to controlnegative thoughts and avoid negative actions. Since the blame game is over, youwill start a new game, where you are the captain, the skipper, the person incharge. And you are ready to take charge of your life and your story.It’s only when you get fully aware or conscious about your story that you canleverage its power in your life’s work.To what extent should you share?I had posted once on social media, “Some stories are shared with the world, someonly with close friends and family and some stories are best shared with yourown soul.” No one knows your circumstances and no one can decide how much ofstory you need to share. It is best to ask your own inner voice.I personally believe in the sharing of story in installments. Share the portionof the story, you feel comfortable sharing. Many factors can influence yourdecision of how much to share such as culture, age, community and so on. Forexample, a young person is more likely to be laughed at by sharingvulnerabilities while a middle-aged person has lesser probability.From healing point of view here are few options and suggestions:• If you feel very vulnerable in sharing a family trauma (incest for example), Iwould suggest that you write your complete story and tear it later. It willstill help in releasing the pent up emotions and trauma.• Share your story with coaches/counselors. The probability of a story leakingis less as the coach has professional commitments, as you become a client. It isbetter to share as much as possible. The more you share, the better counselingyou will be able to get.• Share your stories publicly when you have healed yourself of a certain issueand your struggle has become a victory. This will inspire others and since youhave healed the past, you need not bother too much now.• Michael Margolis, Founder & CEO, Get Storied says, “It’s out of our wounds—thestories we are most afraid to tell—that the true gift emerges.” There is apopular saying in USA these days, “Vulnerability is the new black.” Or in otherwords, it is beneficial to be vulnerable, yet I have my doubts about thepractical side of such openness in eastern cultures (as the family and communityloyalty often gets precedence over the individual).Turning wounds into giftsIrrespective of how much of story, we want to share at what point of time, it isgood to introspect about our wounds, our suffering and emotional baggage. Thegenius has often emerged out of a difficult pain or struggle. The more an arrowis pulled back, the longer distance it travels after all.Michael puts it aptly, “Your greatest source of untapped power is the place inyour story that needs to be reconciled.” It becomes important to reconcileyourself to the deepest suffering in your story and tap its power for personaland professional growth. At the same time, it is important to remember to takecharge of your story, as we need to move on from the stories we are born into,to the stories we choose to live. Don’t we?Look at tragedy as if it were comedyIn this stage, we shift our perspective. There is a famous saying, “The troublesof today become the jokes of tomorrow.” And if you reflect, you would find mostof the time it is true. In fact, Michael points out, “Is your life a comedy or atragedy? Just depends on how you write the story.” If our wounds hold the truegift, then the wound is a gift too. In fact contemplation and spiritual practicecan help in this change of perspective.Isn’t life just a make-believe story? In a way we all live in our ownmake-believe worlds because our beliefs make and break our worlds. So our storytwists, based on what we are able to make our mind believe. Scott McPhersonpoints out in his poem beautifully,“ You use words to ask where can I find the end of sufferingAnd I say there is no end of sufferingBut there is gratitude-For even the suffering,For without it,You could not find your way to peace.”I have personally evolved from brutally honest to kindly honest. Here is aninteresting anecdote, I wrote based on my life experience: -I am 22 and my life Catch 22The disciple, “Guruji, I have always suffered personally and professionallybecause of my habit of telling the truth. I may have been brutally honest andruthlessly frank at times. People are not ready to listen to the bitter truthand I don’t want to tell lies. I am 22, my life Catch 22”The guru, “Tell true stories to give hints and mask the characters, if required.A signal is sufficient for wise (and the fool will not understand, even if youbeat the drums). Bare truth is like an ugly skeleton sometimes, so dress it upas a story.”He added further, “Most of the people have not evolved enough to listen to thetruth. We are insecure, frail, weak and vulnerable beings. It is more importantto be kind than true under such circumstances. Yet, professionally, learn to be,“Kindly honest, politely frank.”Become a witness to your storyThe final step in human evolution is to completely detach ourselves from ourlife story. As the famous quote of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin goes, “We are nothuman beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having ahuman experience.” If we are spiritual beings and we identify our life as atemporary experience, the perspective automatically shifts. In a Skype chat,Michael put it beautifully, “Transformation requires a witness; which is why wehave to tell our story.”We become a witness when we reflect, and there’s a different story altogether,when one sits in the emptiness.The TipThe Universe designed us for storytelling and story listening. Our heartsconnect to stories, our brains are wired for stories and our ears want to listento stories. We want our stories to be heard because our experiences are stories,our complaints are stories and sometimes the biggest burden on our soul, are ouruntold stories. Great legends leave behind legendary stories; great souls writeinspiring stories and great angels in our life keep to themselves ourembarrassing stories.Beliefs are the stories tattooed on our mind, thoughts are the stories we tellourselves, words are the stories we tell others and actions are silent yet themost powerful stories in our lives. And as gooch’s paradox goes, “Not only,things have to be seen to be believed, but also things have to be believed to beseen”. No wonder ‘Miraculous stories’ happen in lives of those who believe inmiracles.Richard Stone points out in his book, “The Healing Art of Storytelling- A sacredjourney of personal discovery” that by restoring our lives we can access toolsfor building self-esteem, learning from mistakes, affirming personal values, andcelebrating the miracles of everyday life.

They come through youbut not from you.And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their ownthoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For, their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you cannot visit, not evenin your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For lifegoes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the make upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you withHis might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness.For, even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He also loves the bow that isstable.”- Kahlil Gibran“What a journey parenting is, one of the hardest one you shall ever do but alsoone of the most rewarding one, the one that teaches you the meaning of love, oflife itself.”Parenting is considered as one of the most challenging work of our life. Thoughsome of us might feel parenting is just a part of life, children grow naturally,what is the big deal. Though very few parents realize the impact parents make ontheir child’s entire life and are fortunate enough to receive the qualityguidance required to raise a child. Due to that, invariably enough we end uppassing our subconscious deficiencies and incapabilities onto our children,inspite of the fact that we love our children the most and always try to do ourbest as a parent.So how we can break the chains of old patterns, drop expectations and let loveand care come through us rather than projecting our parent self from a fixedmindset of raising an ‘improved second version of our own selves’.To raise a child is to raise oneself!Most of the time, as parents we are not even aware of all the damaging effectsour lack of self-control and patience, our impulsiveness and indiscipline haveon our children, also all the positive influence our attitude and actions couldhave on them.Whatever it is we wish to see in our child; whether it is respect for self andothers, self-control, self-confidence, good listening and understanding; we needto imbibe that first. Remember that there are no guarantees in this path, butthe chances are you shall make a positive long lasting impact.So in reality, to earn our children’s respect and trust we have to be worthy ofthat respect and trust in every moment and that will require a good deal ofself- inquiry and introspection. A good question to ask ourselves is - do I earntrust or fear, respect or resentment by being authoritative and demanding frommy children.As parents most of the times, we believe because we are elder in age than ourchildren, we know better. Hence we should tell them what to do; which is thebasic flaw with parenting. While the true foundation of parenting or any kind ofguidance, is the fact that the child is innately wise and want to learnnaturally. The more we trust this fact, the more we can be true guide and lightto our own children, rather than imposing our knowledge on them. As a parent ourjob is to pass information we have and that too, in a way that isunderstandable.The ProcessIn my work as a parenting coach, parents bring lots of questions to coachingsessions and group workshops.Let’s look at some of them and explore some answers –How to inspire children to have a balance of freedom, discipline andresponsibility?When we loosen our perception of how the child should be, we provide the childwith a sense of freedom, which cannot be explained.We live in a modern information age where young children can get any informationthey want and can be more knowledgeable (in terms of information) than theirparents. Whether we like it or not, in modern age parents cannot expectunquestioned obedience and respect from their children as they might have givento their parents as a child and if tried, it usually ignites short-termcompliance followed by rebellious blasts later on and can also lead to lack ofself- esteem and decision making in the child.Let’s start with some reflection; what happens when we try to teachresponsibility and discipline to a child by telling, lecturing, scolding orhitting, we are just doing it from a place of personal reaction to theirmistakes or our own beliefs of how they should or should not behave. And thechild sees our weakness, our lack of self-control and discipline, she/he is hurtand fearful but not inspired to improve on the mistake. They might changebecause of that fear but the change is usually superficial and temporary.It’s not only our children who grow, parents do too. As much we watch what ourchildren do with their lives; they watch us what we do with ours. We can’t tellour children to reach for the stars or moon; all we can do is reach for them,ourselves. When we remember those eyes are watching us every moment, we canstrive to be the more of who we are, more loving, more respectful and morecompassionate.So how do we bring the balance in our children in this fast, modern age – thefact is there are no set rules. Every moment one must endeavor to stay, be andact from a place of one’s higher self. We all are in that place some times whenwe can calmly listen, understand our child and also help them to understand. Themore we practice, the more we can operate from that place.To inspire your children, start with a belief that your child innately isbalanced and it’s our focus on certain things and outer world conditioning thatmakes us and them see and behave otherwise. Then train your mind to accept themwithout any judgments, look what positive behavior they are already exhibitingand start acknowledging that. The more you trust and acknowledge their wisdom,the more they will do too and regain the balance they are born with.“Our kids require us most of all to love and accept them for who they are, notto spend our whole time trying to make them into who we think they should be.Also they need our love the most when we feel they deserve it the least”How to help children improve at any thing?Have you got any clue where did human ever get this crazy idea, that in order tomake children or anyone do better, first we have to make them feel worse? Thinkof the last time you felt humiliated or treated unfairly. Did you feel likeimproving, cooperating or learning to do better?”When someone recognize your little self as big self, celebrate your tinytriumphs, of even trying to do better, empathize and be there with you when youcouldn’t do better, accept you just the way you are; that’s when you really feellike improving and working harder to achieve more.Human brain is inclined to get attracted towards negative; the things which arenot completed, jobs not being done, the place being messy and so on… It is timefor parents to retrain their brain to find the positives about their children;the treasure already hidden there. The more they find it, the more it growseveryday.“When parents take the time to actually listen, with humility, to what childrenhave to say and share, it is amazing what they can learn and provide a valuablegift to their children.“You cannot keep on doing the same things over and over again and expect adifferent result; so now is the time to change your approach.”How to help children prioritize, learn self-control and set limits?To teach anything to your children, first you need to earn their unshakeabletrust and faith in everything you do and say. Let your children feel and learnfrom your attitude that they are so important to you, more significant thananything else. Let them know your trust in them is unshakeable. And if you thinkthey already know, you are mistaken dear friend.Many surveys show that children feel unloved or loved conditionally, untrustedand insignificant in the modern age because they feel work, money, status,society, even laptop and phone calls and other things are more important totheir parents than them.What is the reason they should listen, set limits as parents want and learnself- control if their own parents cannot. Parents cannot teach their child whatthey have not learnt themselves.Model good prioritizing habits; can you avoid the phone calls in family time orwhen talking to your child if it is not an emergency call. Can you control theurge to check your emails or social media status more than necessary and setlimits around things you would like to achieve, like exercising or healthyeating?“The Best and the only way to help your child learn anything is to model thatyourself. Children are natural mimics; they learn and do what they see aroundthem.”How to help a child realize his/her true potential?PLAY. For a child, life is a playground and that’s how they learn most of thethings. If we cannot understand the world from a child’s eye, how is it evenpossible for a child to understand what we try to teach them?Be a playful parent; play with your child as often as you can. Stretch yourselfbeyond your comfort zone; play things your child likes, even if you might havenever played before. Show courage, show confidence and bring the child withinyou alive. Your child will deeply connect with you and in turn with himself.Accept him/her; encourage him/her for who he or she is. Be kind; don’t try toconvert them into some ideal. It can be a rough world, and your child, likeeveryone else, is fighting to survive. Be a happy parent who is balanced andstrive for excellence, without being overly attached to the materialachievements. And you shall see your children being grounded with strong rootsand fly with wind underneath their wings.“My mother and father gave me the greatest gift anyone could ever give toanother person, they believed in me and I soared.”What is the best way to inspire the children towards their purpose, their owndeeper calling in life rather than influencing them to live the parents’ dreamor tread the beaten path?Inspire means ‘in spirit’; go soul to soul versus role to role. Start reflectingon your ability to see your own divinity, your true purpose, your spiritualexistence and you will start communicating at soul level. You will experienceyour interactions will be naturally more joyful, nurturing, inspiring and trulyloving.Experience deeply that the essence of who you really are, is most beautiful,creative, loving, eternal, unlimited formless spirit made of divine essence. Asyou truly observe other human beings (especially children), you will be able toexperience that. Create a family where normal interaction is soul to soul andnot role to role; where you can see the beautiful divinity of others and theycan then see it for themselves too.The Tip“Be a person in whom they can have full faith beyond any doubt. When you areold, nothing else you have done will have mattered as much.”So now if you want a parenting mantra, it would be as simple (or may be not sosimple) –“Bring the qualities in yourself that you want to see in your child – Be theperson you want your child to be and feel the magic.”Dr. Saloni Singh, a medical doctor turned qualified Life and Parenting coach isworking with parents and couples to enhance their relationship with each otherand their children and bring joy and harmony in the families.www.salonisingh.com [http://www.salonisingh.com/]"},{"pageContent":" Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 1.00.08 pm.png [../images/00012.jpeg] HOLISTIC EDUCATION Neha Patel The EssenceChildren are pure, innocent beings who come into this world with a clean slateand the ability to live in the ‘now’. They absorb all that they observe andexperience. Somewhere along, due to the ways of the contemporary world, theystart losing their natural inborn balance and tend to get entangled withbehavioral patterns, which are based on manipulation, fear and guilt. They getconditioned to think negatively and perceive the world to be unfriendly,competitive and stressful. The education today focuses on academic excellenceand does not give enough importance to the emotional and spiritual growth of theindividual.Our vision is to give children the platform to recognize and enhance their ownunique abilities; use their inner intelligence effectively and live withcompassion for others and respect for nature. We endeavor to be a widespreadglobal movement, by reaching out to children, parents, teachers and communities;through workshops, summer camps, after school programs, teacher trainingprograms, online learning, parenting support and eventually full-fledgedschools.Experiential academic learning, enhancing the emotional and spiritual quotientof the child, applying the multiple intelligence paradigms and helping the childexcel in that in which his strength lies; are some of the highlights of theseprograms. For these children, education will be inspiring, creative andsupportive. Some of the vehicles to achieve these objectives are innovative useof art forms, ancient teachings and wisdom along with contemporary methods andtechniques, which will empower children to be psychologically, socially,spiritually and academically well balanced individuals at the forefront of humanevolution.We have already sown the seeds of our Holistic education Model in the form ofthe ‘Little Buddha’ program and the non-profit organization called Reformeducation For A New world (ReNew)The ProcessWhy Holistic Education?Children come into the world with innocence, some genetic information and aninner innate intelligence. They have hope; they are ready to go with the flow.These children grow up to become the future of the present world. But theirfuture depends a whole lot on what they are exposed to as they grow up. Thevariety of information that they get from their parents, family, society,school, culture and their country, all have an impact on them.So what are we exposing the innocent unassuming child to? well, we are all awareof the state of the world as it is today. There is immense depletion of humanvalues, respect and basic integrity. There are rapes, violations, killings,scams and so many other atrocities that are carried out.They have gotten woven into the fabric of the society creating greed, hatred,indifference, power play, manipulation, guilt, fear and apathy. There is a hugeloss of freedom. Materialism is emphasized. Insecurity and suspiciousness are atlarge. There is loss of trust and peace of mind. The point is that are thechildren of today and citizens of tomorrow aware of how to deal with all ofthis? Are they aware that they have a choice and that they can choose to createa different life and reality for themselves?In most cases the children are trained to buy into this disruptive state of theworld. They come to believe that it a dangerous tough place to live in where youhave to fight to survive. Their natural instincts are curbed and their innerknowing is not allowed to surface. Their inherent knowledge takes a backseat andmost children end up getting on to the factory belt of conventional educationand conditioning, being packaged for the material world ahead of them.We are living in a world where at the macro level we face rapid depletion ofnatural resources with no alternatives and yet we continue being wasteful,creating a world of scarcity. Environmental issues such as global warming,harmful effects of pollution, radiation, weapons of mass destructions, poverty,terrorism, etc. continue to haunt us.At the micro level, we live in a society where a “more is better” mindsetprevails, leaving people dissatisfied with what they have. Today’s highlystructured environment leaves many individuals lacking the very skills needed tolive with ease and joy such as creativity, adaptability, communication andresilience. The way of living, places emphasis on high level of competitiveness,which is cut throat at times, the pressure to perform is so great that manycollapse under it, leading to depression, anxiety and physical ailments.Such exposure has negative effects on the child’s mind wherein they implicitlylearn to trust only a few, learn that the world is a bad and dangerous place.What we don’t realize is that these implied thoughts, beliefs and feelingscreate an imbalance in a perfectly balanced child, by triggering theirsympathetic nervous system and thus they are constantly on a high alert andbehave selfishly to “preserve” themselves. This behavior rather than beinghelpful in emergencies has become the child’s first nature in today’s times.Thus, the person is always on the fight-or-flight mode.In my practice whenever a child is brought to me for therapy by the parents,more often than not, the child turns out to be the most functional in thedysfunctional family he or she belongs to. The child’s behavior, which is seenas an emotional disturbance or as disruptive by the parents, is actually areaction to the dysfunction in the family. When this is brought to the notice ofthe parents they often tell me that we cannot change so you get the child tochange. They don’t even recognize or admit how their behavior and patterns areleading to the difficulties the child is facing. But how will the child adjustand change his reaction when day in and day out he is exposed to the samedysfunctional behavior in his home? Then he has the choice of joining in andbecoming like them or becoming indifferent or rebelling or caving in under thepressure. The child ends up living in a vicious circle, the parents aredisillusioned by the world and its systems so they believe in fighting to live,this is passed on to the child and the child indulges in the same behavior as hedoes not know any better and the cycle continues.In this fast paced world where on one end technology has increased comfort ithas also decreased the frustration tolerance. The individual’s environment ischanging rapidly occupying most of his attention and leaving no time forintrospection. This has created progress externally but regression internally.We often don’t understand our feelings. For example, when we’re feeling sad, wesay we’re just bored. When we’re angry we say we’re just tired. We have lostaccess to our feelings and neither do we want to accept them, if they arise. Weseem to have found a way to advance at lightening speed yet at the same timehave dropped to new levels of low.These loop holes are not unknown to society nor are they ignored, but wheneveran individual or organization has tried to bridge the gap, it hasn’t been assuccessful as they would have liked to be. This is due to our own resistances.The society is not ready to move out of their comfort zone and face the unknown.The bandwagon effect is so deeply entrenched in the masses, hampering to bringabout the change.It is therefore time to question: what would it take for us to make sure wecreate a conducive and free environment wherein the children are allowed toblossom?What would it take for us to work towards a better future for our children?How can we together work towards this?What can we do and change now? what will be the effect of this change 5, 10, 15,50 years from now?The VisionThe first 8-10 years of the child’s life are the most influential ones. It is atthis time that they develop their perception of the world and theirsurroundings. Every aspect about living and the way of being gets fitted intotheir psyche. The core beliefs that they acquire during this period play asignificant role in the choices that they make during the course of their life,which in turn shapes their future.What if we could present to the child universal wisdom and the techniques toimbibe it just like we present to them and make them aware of history,geography, chemistry, physics and biology?There is a movement around the world where people are waking up to the presentsituation and shifting towards a holistic way of living, working and being. Theyare awakening to the necessity of getting in touch with their own core being andliving life with authenticity. The need of the hour is for an extensive movementto create a wide shift in the present situation.Our vision is to have a holistic system of education, which includes theemotional, spiritual, psychological and intuitive aspects of the child alongwith the academic information that is made available for the child. A system inwhich the child learns from within; has intrinsic motivation; where theemotional health of the child is given as much if not more importance than theacademic performance. A system where students are not just learning to get thegrades or marks, but learning to understand and apply; they have the freedom toexpress themselves; they are able to relate to nature and are able to use theircreativity at every point.The idea is to educate the children using multiple models, techniques,applications drawn from the world wisdom and weaving them into the academic andnon- academic training that the child receives so that education is inspiring,creative and supportive.Some of the significant aspects of Holistic Education are:Experiential Learning: The children are given opportunities to acquire and applyknowledge, skills and feelings in an immediate and relevant setting. It is adirect experience of whatever is being studied.We need to let the children live with the question, let them explore and findthe answers. In this way various faculties and abilities are put into use andthe connections between different topics becomes apparent to them.Every topic that is covered in the curriculum is converted into the projectformat and clubbed together with various techniques that interests students andhelp them ingrain the subject matter.Being in Balance: extremes of any sort create an imbalance in the functioning ofan individual or society. The holistic education model believes in allowing thechildren to enjoy all aspects of life but with awareness, balance and theirvalues in place. In the process they will learn to make choices that worktowards their own highest benefit as well as that of those around them.Some of the areas where extremes are experienced are competition and praise.Healthy competition is known to be conducive for the growth of a child and helpsthem to reach higher levels of their potential. Unfortunately the presentsystems undermine the positive learning climate in schools leading to unhealthyand extreme competition. Creating a balance enables a child to get anopportunity and allow his/her uniqueness to flourish. Holistic educationencourages children to improve themselves rather than improving themselvescompared to others.Praise on the other hand if given in extreme, leads to the child having to liveup to the expectations of others at all times. This leads to undue stress,pressure and feelings of inadequacy. Too little praise tends to be de-motivatingfor a child. So parents and teachers too need to learn to keep a balance.Acknowledging Individual Uniqueness:Children come with their own distinctive abilities and intelligence. Moving awayfrom the general practice of fitting the children into pre-cast dyes of how theyshould be learning. The Holistic education Model encourages and provideschildren with the means and opportunities to explore their own uniqueness, tolearn, and to develop in the way that suits them the best. We apply the MultipleIntelligence Paradigm by Howard gardner, which acknowledges the fact that humanshave varied intelligences and they function using a combination of them.For example, If a child has been indentified as being high on musicalintelligence, he is given specialized training to develop it further. Not onlythat, this ability of his is used as a modality to help him learn other topicstoo.Mindfulness Training: This is one of the most important aspects of Holisticeducation. Mindfulness is defined as “the awareness that emerges through payingattention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to theunfolding of experiences moment by moment” (Kabat-Zinn, 2003, p.145).The children would be trained in being mindful and incorporating this trainingin every aspect of their lives.Research suggests that training in mindfulness has the potential to enhancechildren’s attention and focus, and improve memory, self-acceptance,self-management skills, and self-understanding. (Hooker.K.,Fodor.I)Expressive Arts: Another very important aspect of the Holistic Education Modelis Expressive Arts. Children experience art from the beginning of their life.Art is a powerful resource that is built within each individual.The rhythmic beating of the heart, the rocking movement that the childexperiences comfort from, the different facial expressions they see, are allforms of art. Art forms are not only taught as formal dance, drawing or musictraining. Going beyond that, art forms are included in every aspect of theprogram to express, experience and put forth their creative abilities in allareas of their lives. For e.g. A poem in english would be sung to music anddramatized. That way the child doesn’t simply learn it ‘by heart’ butunderstands the true essence of the poem.The different art forms included in the model are dance and movement, drama,music, visual arts and crafts, storytelling, play, pottery etc. There is immenseamount of research done and information available on the usefulness of art formsfor the overall development of a child at all levels-psychological, spiritual,physical, emotional and academic.Spiritual Intelligence:Holistic education focuses on tapping into and developing the SpiritualIntelligence of the child. It aims at bringing up and enhancing the abilities ofthe child to be compassionate, self-aware, non judgmental and loving. Livingwith integrity, honesty and equanimity, connecting with the deeper intelligencewithin, respecting self, others, nature and humanity are encouraged. Consciousliving is taught where caring for nature and its resources is emphasized. Theirintuitive abilities are sharpened.Unique Assessment SystemThe Holistic education Model has a flexible assessment system and yet is in linewith mainstream education. We believe children should have equal opportunitiesto excel in whatever they are learning irrespective of the style of deliveringit. Evaluations are done not to pass or fail a child but to make sure that thechild has understood a concept. Instead of tests, project and research formatsare utilized and the children are assessed on the basis of that project such asthe language aspect, the aspect of science, research the methods used, theirunderstanding of the outcomes. We believe in individual abilities of each childand one child may excel in a particular ability while the second in another.Instead of pitting students against one another, the child gets a qualitativefeedback for their performance on a project, task or activity and is given theguidance on improving in it if required.Enhancing Emotional Intelligence:Emotional intelligence refers to an ability to recognize the meanings ofemotions and their relationship and to reason and resolve the problems based onthis understanding. Emotional intelligence is involved in the capacity toperceive emotions, assimilate emotion-related feelings, understand theinformation of those emotions, and manage them (Mayer, J.D., Caruso, D., &Salovey, P., 1999).We believe that the emotional well being of an individual is very important andcan take them far ahead in life. The Little Buddha Program, which is a majorcomponent of The Holistic Education Model, works towards helping the childenhance his/her emotional intelligence.The Little Buddha Program and WorkshopsThe program helps children in understanding emotions, and expressing themconstructively, creating a balance in their thoughts and actions. It workstowards enhancing the already built-in intuitive capacities of the child. Itteaches children to keep the highest good of self and others around them inperspective while taking any action. It teaches them to recognize others as wellas their own uniqueness, appreciate it and set comfortable and achievabletargets to better themselves. It builds the frustration tolerance of thechildren and helps them become resilient. It embeds gratitude, trust, humility,compassion, honesty and respect into their way of being. It teaches them to beself-reliant, responsible and taking initiative for self-growth.The Little Buddha program is a non-religious program, which works towards thepsychological, emotional and spiritual growth and wellbeing of a child. Throughdifferent activities and sessions coupled with their inner understanding andintelligence the children incorporate everything they experience in the programinto their way of being.The word Buddha comes from the Sanskrit word ‘Buddh’ which means being awakenedand enlightened. Our vision is to help the children become aware beings who livetheir life to the fullest with balance and integrity. This program aims atbringing out a ‘Little Buddha’ in every child.The program is designed for children between the ages of 3-16 years. It isdivided in to 3 groups of ages, 4 to 6, 7 to 11 and 12 to 16. It makes use ofArt Based Therapy techniques, meditation, role-play, visual imagery, emotionalFreedom Techniques, Access Consciousness and many other modalities. Throughdifferent activities and sessions coupled with their inner understanding andintelligence the child incorporates all they experience in the program intotheir way of being.The Little Buddha Program, Some Highlights:• Works towards enhancing the already built-in intuitive capacities of the childand helping the child to use them effectively• Teaches the children to keep the highest good of self and others around themin perspective while taking any action.• Teaches children not to compete with others, instead recognize their ownuniqueness, appreciate it and set comfortable and achievable targets to betterthemselves. Teaches them to be non-judgmental of others. It helps them seeothers perspectives and points of view, thus accepting self and others for theirown uniqueness, helps children understand emotions, and express themselvesconstructively creating a balance in their thoughts and actions.• Builds the frustration tolerance of the child and helps them become resilient.• Helps the children break out of self-imposed limitations and let go oflimiting ideas, beliefs, thoughts and feelings.• Weaves gratitude, trust, humility, compassion, honesty and respect into thefabric of their life.• Teaches children to value and appreciate all that they have and be conscious• Teaches them to make conscious choices, enhance their self -confidence andself-worth.• Encourages assertiveness, team-work, understanding boundaries, empathizingwith others, prioritizing effectively, dealing with bullies and peer pressure,respecting gender differences, and forgiving self and others.• Teaches them to be self-reliant, responsible and taking initiative for self-growth.• Aims to improve their concentration and focusing skills.• The children are allowed to be themselves, without any judgment. They areallowed to express themselves and they feel totally accepted just the way theyare.The environment influences the child and evidently plays a big part in his/herperception of everything within and without. Parents play a very significantrole in their life. Therefore, it is important that these significant peoplealso enroll into the Little Buddha concept for the child to benefit completelyfrom it. To achieve this there are group sessions and individual sessionsconducted with parents of each child. These sessions intend to promoteunrestrictive parenting which benefits the child by improving parent childrelationship. The parents would be able to see their child in a different lightand understand his/her uniqueness and needs. This will further help the childcarry forward whatever they learn in the program and also imbibe it into theirown lives.Some of the techniques and modalities we use while conducting the Little BuddhaProgram are:• Arts based therapy techniques such as drama, singing, dance and movement,visual arts, music, story telling and free play.• Guided Imagery• Visual Meditations• Role play• Emotional Freedom Technique• Mindfulness Training• Metaphors• Affirmations• Access Consciousness fundamentals• And many moreSo I ask all the conscious beings reading this;What would it take for us to believe that a change is possible?What energy, space and consciousness can we be to co-create a different realityfor the children and for us?How does it get any better than this? What else is possible?Lets all contribute to make this world a better place, for you, for the entirehuman race.The Tip:• Children are to be appreciated for who they be and not only for what theyachieve academically.• Keep the Balance in your life and it will be reflected in your child’s life.Balance in every aspect is important.• Be smart about praising your child. Too much praise leads to the child havingto live up to your and others’ expectations at all times. This leads to unduestress, pressure and feelings of inadequacy. Too little praise tends to bede-motivating for a child.• Encourage your children to work towards improving themselves rather thantrying to get better than the other.• Include a practice of meditation daily for yourself and your children to tuneinto their own awareness and intuitive abilities and their true potential.• Inculcate being mindful and aware as a way of life for your family.• Refrain from projecting your own limitations, conclusions, judgments, issues,expectations on to your child. Remember that the child has come into this worldthrough you but to live his/her own life.• Be the change yourself, and the rest will follow, if it’s for their highestgood.• Give your child a chance to make choices.• Encourage and help the child develop his/her own uniqueness.• Your child will definitely teach you a few lessons, so be ready to learn.• Trust in abundance.• In every situation, say to yourself “How Does It Get Any Better Than This? Andthe universe will follow up on that.• Listen to your child. Truly Listen.• Include art forms into your life. Just for the fun of expressing yourself.Neha Patel comes with 19 years of experience working with children and adults asa trainer, counselor and psychologist.

It does not happen in the pastor in the future and it does not occur through acquiring recipes for health andhealing. In order to access the innate capacity for healing that we have beenendowed with, we must be able to look inside ourselves and be present with whatwe see and feel. There is however one formidable force that will prevent us fromconnecting to that inner essence that holds our inherent healing power: FEAR.Healing cannot occur in the presence of fear and any healing process requiresthe full release of fear, with its many layers and deeply seated authority. Fearis the energy that impedes and stops true healing. Most people are afraid tolook within, at the magnificent and sacred place inside themselves that holdsthe key to health, abundance, joy and love. They are afraid because fear is theonly field that they have been trained in, sequentially and consistently everysingle day throughout their lives.Fear is an intrinsic part of our lives and can be categorized as follows:1. Sociological fear• Societal fear• Familial fear• Individual fear2. Perceptual fear• Factual fear• Imaginary fear3.Universal fear• Abandonment and Separation• Low Self-worth• Lack of TrustUnderstanding that fear defines our limitations will give us the tools tounleash the force of inner healing.I will explain these categories, one by one.1. Sociological fear• Societal or Collective FearWe are the children of our society and we have been forged and conditioned,taught and chiseled by our forefathers’ beliefs, rules, accomplishments andfears. This would be all good news if our society were based on love,compassion, understanding and respect. Unfortunately it is not. With maybe a fewisolated and small cultures around the globe, otherwise we live in a worldshaped and defined by fear.Society has been very effective in teaching us to live in fear: fear of war, ofcancer, of financial crisis and depression, fear of god, of heart disease, ofterrorism, fear of going to hell, of not having the right job, fear of otherpeople, of other nations and other customs, fear of being too fat to beconsidered beautiful or too weak to become successful, of illnesses and virusesand epidemics.We live our lives in various gradients of fear without even being aware of it.We are imbued with fear in all its colors, flavors and intensities.Fear is everywhere. People take their first dose of daily fear with theirmorning coffee, while watching the news, reading the newspaper or listening tothe car radio on their way to work. They start to feel the fists of fear intheir guts right after brushing their teeth in the morning.The truth is that fear sells. It is also true that for every sad anddisconcerting thing that we hear about in the news, there is a beautiful,uplifting and empowering thing that is happening somewhere in the world.Unfortunately, that would not sell, so the accent is put on what sells: tragedy,pain, and fear. A continuous stream of fear-creating news is bombarding us allday long.Scientists study the effects of fear on individuals and society. Dr. DeepakChopra and Jim Clifton in their article entitled “The Fear Factor: How ScaredAre People?” say:“Over the past decade the word “fear” has become all too familiar. After 9/11,critics of the war on terror called it fear mongering. After the financial crashof 2008, living in a climate of fear became the lot of millions of people wholost their jobs, retirement accounts, and homes. In the face of such violence,the prevalence of fear can have a profound effect on the health, well-being, andeconomic development: if a society is in a constant state of fear, it won’tproduce anything good.”Fear is a phenomenon with a strong grasp on our society.• Familial FearFamilial fear is what we are exposed to on a smaller scale, in our very ownfamilies.For example, if a mother is afraid of germs and getting sick chances are thather children are afraid of the very same things. If they were brought up intoher way of thinking, they too will believe that germs are scary and that it isextremely easy to get sick.If parents or primary caretakers were afraid of other people, afraid of life ingeneral, their children learn a specific behavior that they believe will keepthem safe. Fear, distrust and living their lives in small doses created aninherited behavior with deep repercussions for their quality of life.These are familial fears; they are familiar, so most people do not even questionthem. Until they are released, life will be shaped by them.• Individual FearIndividual fears are based on a person’s own past experiences. If something didnot turn quite the way it was expected and that caused suffering, we are nowafraid of doing it again.For example, falling in love only to end up being rejected and hurt might createthe fear of meeting new prospective partners. Going along with the dream tostart a business and doing everything to make it happen, only to fail, mightlead to the decision of playing it safe by not following the call of innerdesires ever again.These are individual fears. The first layers are embedded in our cells evenbefore we were born. When we were formed as new life potential in our mother’swomb, our continuously growing number of cells was nestled at the core of themother’s body, surrounded by her cells. What this means is that our cells werealready experiencing the emotions and feelings of joy or despair, fear or lovethat the mother felt.To sum it all up, from a sociological point of view, we are drenched in fear. Weare first soaked in family fear, even preconditioned before birth; societalfears are attaching weights to our ankles and fogging our minds on a dailybasis; and then our personally created individual fears stop us from living.2. Perceptual fear• Factual FearFactual fear is based in real life and is related to things that are indeeddangerous, without dispute; like being on the path of a developing tornado, orclose to a raging forest fire, or going for a walk bare foot in a snowstorm.This is the healthy energy of fear that allows us to remain safe and it isembedded in our DNA.• Imaginary FearThe very opposite of the factual fears, the imaginary fears are not based inreality. They are fabricated, knitted, colored, inflated, expanded,manufactured, embellished soap bubbles created with our thoughts. Questions suchas “What if I fail?”, “What if this goes wrong?” or“What if I will be alone for the rest of my life?” create an imagined fear,because they are not anchored in reality. We do not know with certainty that wewill fail, that our plans will not succeed or that we will not find a partner toshare our lives with. Imaginary fear stems from thoughts directed towards afuture that we couldn’t predict. The negative “What if?” questions have thepower to paralyze us and stop us before we even start.The third category of fears has been identified by the great visionary GreggBraden. He says that these three Universal fears are at the base of all thefears and behaviors that are present in ourselves and others.3. Universal FearsThese three basic underlying fears are the root of the sociological andperceptual fears. With few exceptions, our experiences of pain, suffering,illness, disease, and emotional trauma have their roots in these core universalfears.In his book “The Divine Matrix”, gregg Braden wrote: “The root of our ‘negative’experiences may be reduced to one of three universal fears (or a combination ofthem): abandonment, low self-worth, or lack of trust.”• Abandonment and SeparationThe fear of abandonment and separation stems from the ancient fear that we wereabandoned by our creator without explanation or reason. As a result of thisperceived separation we feel alone in the world and in the Universe. This fearis manifested in our lives through the relationships we create with otherpeople. We are devastated when they fail or we leave them in order to avoidgetting hurt. The truth is that relationships do not fail; they cannot fail.They are taking their course as energy streams between people; they are thecreations of people’s beliefs, fears and expectations.• Low Self-worthThe second Universal fear is the fear that we are not “good enough”. Almostevery person in our world has experienced low self-esteem.The professional, friendship or romantic relationships in our lives will matchour expectations and our beliefs of not being good enough. When we don’t feelworthy of our most cherished dreams, we create our relationships and experiencesfrom the standpoint of low self-esteem.• Lack of TrustThe third universal fear is the lack of trust in life. Most people believe thatthis world is not safe for us to live in, and the processes of life are unsafe,scary and threatening. This fear is expressed as the inability to surrender toour experiences and relationships. These relationships mirror our projections ofthis world being unsafe and unworthy of our trust.Louise Hay says:“Fear is a lack of trust in ourselves, and because of this, we don’t trust Life.We don’t trust that we’re being taken care of on a higher level, so we feel wemust control everything from the physical level. Obviously, we’re going to feelfear because we can’t control everything in our lives.”The universal fears are deeply embedded in the collective and individualconsciousness and create the core of our fear-based life. It is no mystery thatwe are afraid and that fear is a well-accepted state in our society, in ourfamilies, amongst our friends and inside ourselves. Our inherent capacity forhealing is deeply buried beneath all these layers of fear; therefore in order toaccess it we must release them all.Underneath all the fear there lays our very essence: powerful, magnificent andwhole.How do we release fear so that we can heal our bodies and our lives? How do welet go of the fear so that we can connect with who we truly are? How do we dealwith fear?Dr. Wayne Dyer says:“The only way to deal with a fear is to face it directly. In the book A Coursein Miracles, it says there are only two emotions: love and fear. When you’re infear, you have left love behind; meaning, you have left your belief that thereis a divine source that will guide you through all aspects of your life.Reconnect to your source, know that you’re not alone, or, as the Course says,“If you knew who walked beside you, at all times, on this path that you havechosen, you could never experience fear again.” Trust in yourself, and you’retrusting in the very wisdom that created you.”The only way to deal with fear is to face it openly, to remain still in itspresence, to breathe and allow it to wash over us and be present while feelingit; by doing so we stop resisting it. By releasing our resistance, fear releasesits grip. There are no corners to cut and there is no running in circles: theonly way to deal with fear is to face it fully, without resistance; feeling thelayers of fear snapping at our heels and instead of running away from them,choosing to turn around and face them straight in the face.A Practical Guide for Releasing FearAfter reading this article so far and finding about all the different categoriesof fear and feeling it more acutely in your body, you might be asking now: howabout me and my fears in this very moment?Here’s a fragment of my “Sacred Oak Tree Meditation” that will teach you how torelease any emotion or fear that troubles you.

I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”In the absence of fear, only we will remain.We will turn around and look deep inside ourselves and see our own magnificence.In the absence of fear the answers to our questions will arise from deep withinour divine essence and healing will take place. In the absence of fear we willaccess the strength and the power to heal ourselves, our families, ourcommunities and our world.Rucsandra Mitrea is a healer; her work with countless clients over the years hasearned her the title “The Body Whisperer”.

One who acceptedexistence of self and went on to survive by discovering food. He is called‘Survivor’. The other one questioned his existence and went deeper in the forestto discover the meaning and the purpose but more than that attempted to knowwhat is life and who am I? He is called ‘Mystic’.Origin of ‘belief ’ lies in the journey from ‘I Survive’ to “I exist’. Else,there was no reason for man to care for his own existence and try to survive bydiscovering food and protecting himself against dangers of the nature, unless hewas driven by need to survive. Hence Belief is originated from the realizationof “Need” i.e. “Need to survive”. This ‘need to survive’ became the origin ofbelief, which in turn became mother of all belief for humanity to evolve. Needto survive is indifferent towards existence of higher self, cosmic power or godas Survivor had no clue about it. There was no way, need to survive andevolution would have happened, had humanity known existence of god because withthat, would have come the paradigm of being “taken care of ” or “being providedfor”.The biggest hurdle for survivor was uncertainty posed by death, dangers ofnature, search for food etc. And to reduce uncertainty, he created institutionswhich were rulebook be it marriage, monogamy, family or social. It was to ensurehigher degree of certainty. However desire to chase certainty did not happenwithout the birth of emotions which gave optimism and hope for tomorrow and manwanted to look forward to it. If not for emotions, man would have lived his lifein each moment after discovering food and sex and knowledge of death which hehas no control on. 3 meals a day was not created as a need of the body but toensure certainty for food. Like wise, humanity had to cultivate monogamy toensure survival. It was also built to ensure food is available. Monogamy wasessentially the first contract ever signed between a man and a woman to ensurethat if woman stayed back and did not search for food, food was to be providedby man in return of sex. After the birth of child, it got further imposed morestrictly as man wanted to take limited responsibility of being a provider offood, which by now included his own self, his woman and children. Clearly, hedid not want to hunt for food for months to come back and discover that he hasto provide for one more child which is not his own. Hence sex and food wereinterwoven and traded. Monogamy or loyalty were natural outcome of this tradecontract but were never the reason for men and women to agree to monogamy inthat pre contractive era. Same were the reason for woman to ensure that her manremains loyal to her and continue to provide food and certainty and shall notbuild another home. If not for food and non-availability of contraceptives,humanity would not have agreed for something as un-natural as monogamy. This iswhat west today is experimenting where food, safety and sex is available, hencepeople are breaking formal family and social institution.Hence loyalty, commitment, security were invented through marriage and that ishow interdependency was cultivated which gradually was scaled to build aconnected community. Survival through food was not a challenge for men and womenas they both were capable of finding food for themselves. If not for sex, birthof child and emotions, interdependency would have not have developed.Life was still quite mechanical till this point and wheel of time and space wasjust beginning to move for him, through hunger, sex and uncertainty, they hadsome sense of emotions but survivor did not know how to react to it tillprocreation happened which gave birth to emotions. Birth of a child gave birthto 2 distinct emotions. Curiosity and wonderment. This was the beginning ofbirth of mystic in a survivor.In wonderment, he discovered himself merging in the flow. He turned more anexplorer and danced to the tune of nature and began to recognize sunrise, sunsetas much as laughter or cry of a baby. It triggered hope, optimism and desire toexperience life. But this was still not enough for him to dig deeper into lifeas it generated no such need to know higher self. Hope and desire thus createdthrough wonderment further pushed him to reduce degree of uncertainty and mindwas developed to work to ensure that food and sex are taken care of to ensurerhythm of wonderment to be continuous.It is through unknown nature of death, fear of survival for himself and family,disruption in his joy and wonderment gave birth to pain and forced him to becomecurious about life. Thus through the development of mind, as he appliedcuriosity to discover deeper layers of emotions, he had the desire to discoverthe same question asked by Mystic. In essence, His questions about life keptgrowing to understand the human spirit and evolution on the planet so that hecan better prepare for tomorrow and be certain. However hard he resembled hisquest by now with that of a mystic, there was one clear difference in mystic andsurvival. Survivor wanted to know answers of deeper questions to be more certainand survive, while mystic had no such assumption in his quest. Hence, his questfor deeper secrets was to gain more certainty.With these questions, survivor then happens to interact with Mystic who had verylittle knowledge about the needs of physical body, responsibilities, needs,commitments, loyalty, and belief. It had no idea of human emotions fromsurvivor’s perspective and only knew about the spirit of humanity throughrevelation and self-actualization in meditation. It knew bliss and knew there issomething deeper about human life then just actualized by the survivor. Mysticknew no suffering, pain or certainty or death as they saw life as continuousrhythm beyond the presence of physical body and for them everything was anexperience.Mystic faced one big challenge in showing that light to the Survivor toalleviate their sufferings and make them understand higher meaning in life.Mystic failed in explaining, hence focused on helping Survivor experience themysticism through which they will discover the cause and cure for theirsuffering. Initiation into connecting with the inner self to implore requiredthat survivor believes that some infinite invisible force but has design of thelife and has power to help us alleviate from our suffering. Hence invention ofrituals, techniques and process to help humanity acknowledge existence of higherself took place, which gave birth to faith and all these rules were put togetherto keep faith intact, which later on became religion. Intent of the religion wasnever to turn a survivor into mystic but to make him better at surviving. It wasonly meant to a) develop faith in life so that curiosity rests and give peace byparking his quest and hoping that someone out there will help and b) becomegateway to connect with mysticism and begin to have same revelation as mystichad to experience truth.This brought paradigm shift in evolution. Birth of faith which gave hope, raisedvibratory level of the survivor to look beyond his own selfish survival needsand leave heritage on the planet in hoping of getting to see god after death ifnot in the life time. Objective of meeting god was to experience life beyondsufferings and explore possibilities of the choices, heaven and hell along withgod was created by mystic to further give a form to their faith. Possibilitiesof choice that were rather limited for the survivor now through revelationsbecame possible and Survivor began to evolve their belief about what is possiblefor human being to achieve more degree of certainty. Clearly they had to createpunishments for people who break these rules and breaking the rules meant threatto survival of society and to family and then to individuals. This is howmorality was born to safeguard survival.That is how faith became the driver of human belief system. Choices showed thatmore is possible and that got mind thinking of exploring more. Throughmythological stories, Heroism was created with the intent to expand horizons ofhuman mind to break his limitation and create hope that more choices can beexercised to feel empowered.Like the first contract between man and woman to have loyalty and commitment, Hecreated rules at each level. Marriage had one such rulebook and then theyexpanded it to create rulebook to build a society to live together. These ruleswere consciously developed for mutual survival and were passed on to the nextgeneration. Over the centuries, no one questioned them, but they were passed onas way of life. They became belief and got coded in the subconscious of cominggeneration which gradually became human intelligence over a long period of timebefore getting passed on in the DNA. So, an experience when classified asessential for survival becomes belief, it gets stored in consciousness and overa period of time, gets pushed into sub consciousness and then finally becomespart of the DNA and gets passed on in genes.Every moment is an experience and if we have a choice to live that moment inwonderment of nature but we also have a choice to call it good or bad. If welabel it, we create a belief. So, if you look at a flower from the window ofyour car on the roadside, you can wonder how nature has created so many colorsand smells, turn curious to experience all such colors or think how dirty thatflower is and how much you love roses. If you choose to live in wonderment anddevelop curiosity, your energies will automatically begin to observe all suchwonders of the nature thus making you live a life in bliss. But when anexperience is not lived with degree of wonderment, thus curiosity, it generatesan emotion and a thought which is what a belief is. By developing mind to likeor dislike an experience, we are tuning ourselves towards certainty. We just didnot like color and smell of a new flower and we wanted certainty of our emotionswhen we see a flower and that is fixed in our mind as to what comes from Rose.Hence mind was cultivated to ensure certainty and direct our energies towardsthe experience, which we have known. This is how belief works by creatingpatterns, which ensures certainty of the experience.A belief has 2 components to it and that is emotion (Yin) and a thought (Yang),which is generated, based on an experience. Together they become electromagneticfield as per quantum physics, which says everything is vibrating and nothing isfixed in the universe. So, when we form a belief, we begin to limit range offrequencies in which known experiences which validate our belief becomeprominent rather than expanding our frequencies range in case of living inwonderment which opens us up for new experiences.Parents pass on to us all the belief, which ensure that we are safe and cansurvive. Hence parenting is done not in a manner where child is allowed toexplore life and its own path but to ensure that child survives based on best ofthe knowledge available to parents. So, if you are an engineer, safest bet foryou is to see that your son is also an engineer and that way, you have fulfilledyour responsibility towards your child. However it has to be very loudlyrealized that such type of parenting operate at bare minimum fulfillment of theresponsibility and has being obsessed with self than realizing the true,infinite potential of the child.Belief is for human life what operating system is for computers and cell phones.It is an environment which support certain type of human experiences and thuscreates a domain within which journey of human life operates. So, how can anapplication meant for windows environment work on other OS? If your operatingsystem says, all men are stronger than us and that life is a compromise, howcould you experience anything other than this belief, which is your own personaltruth, either acquired or developed? So, if you went through abuse in the handof men in your childhood and formed a belief that men abuse, you will eitheralways work towards protecting yourself thus turning aloof in your growing yearsor always finding a situation which witnesses that belief as often as you seekvalidation of your truth.And this is the irony. We human beings have this constant need to experience ourexistence (in absence of a mystic component in us). It is our need to prove thatwe are surviving. Our survival is dependent upon how we see life, which isnothing but belief. Hence we would always have those experiences, which validateour belief. So, when a partner cheated me, it confirmed to my belief thatpartnership shall not be done. I had gone outside my belief to enter inpartnership and that is why it fell flat to bring me back to my stable point ofbelief.Hence, though, we could go out of our belief but that creates so much ofuncertainty that we get unstable and instability shakes the basic belief of“Need to Survive” and system automatically works towards creating events inwhich we feel safe and surviving.If we wish to break limiting belief given to us since thousands of years whichare stored in our subconscious, we have no other option but to integrate amystic in us to open up to infinite possibilities and through that we will beable to attune ourselves to the CODE written in our subconscious for the purposeof our this life time. This means, begin a shift from “Survivor” to “I exist”and this means really defining your minimum needs for existence. So, here is howyou can do it:Make 3 circles: innermost circle carries need for breathing, food, shelter andhealth: when I did it, I found that I can exist with bare minimum money and moveto a village. This took away all the compulsion to live in large city,facilities etc. It just vanished when I found that I could exist through mylife.Second circle: choose the intimate environment, which will support yourexistence: In my case, it was my family, nature and free harmonious expression.Third circle: This is the circle in which you have all the compulsions which inabsence of connectivity to inner self, create an illusion that it is real andput you in constant chase:After making a list of desires and ambitions, I turned inwards to innermostcircle and remained there and purpose of my life unfolded on its own throughseries of mystical experiences including clairaudience. Once found it,automatically I saw changes happening in this circle of people, relationship,surroundings and work. This process will trigger deep-rooted emotions, beliefand you shall begin to ask why, do I need to experience all this. This is thebeginning of integrating Mystic in Survivor giving you joy of life fulfillingpurpose of life.Though it is a detailed process and often may require guidance of a coach, butthen there is always an Eklavya in us, if we believe in it.Naveen Varshneya is a Founder, Life Coach & Healer- NV Life Treatment Centre-Treatment based on quantum physics and techniques are taught to heal self in‘Science of Life’ Workshop program.About NV Life: In year 2010, New Delhi, through a series of coincidences anddivine intervention, first patient of Schizophrenia stopped hallucinating usingsimple principle of balancing electromagnetic field. Through word of mouth, aspatients suffering with various disorders began to get relief, they establishedscience of illness and cure, which found its base in Quantum Physics. Theseprinciples were then applied on various issues from chronic diseases toboardroom problems and found validation of the principles. Objective was toestablish a science, which can be passed on to people to help them curethemselves. This led them to come out with a program called “A course in Scienceof Life”, which is now taught as treatment in their clinical practice and taughtas self help and wellness program in workshops so that people can begin toreverse their disorders and sufferings.

Find out more on theoptimist.comEVER SINCE HE SAW DISNEY’S animated classic Fantasia as a young boy, RobWilliams had dreamt of being a magician. Now, a half- century later, he hasbecome one. Williams doesn’t use magic to clean the kitchen, like Mickey Mousedoes in Fantasia. He cleans something far more important: the subconscious,which drives most of our behavior and experience. There is no shortage ofpersonal growth gurus today. Yet many of the techniques they offer fail whenconscious commitments fail to overwrite self-limiting subconscious beliefs.Changing the subconscious is precisely the focus of Williams’ PSYCH-K® method,which he developed almost 25 years ago. PSYCH-K® offers a simple, direct processto overcome self-sabotage.Rob Williams didn’t set out to become a psychotherapist. After studyingphilosophy in college, he took a job in the backpacking industry, inspired by apowerful experience in nature he had as a teenager. He later moved on toexecutive positions in the energy management and telecommunications industries,until one day he realized that his work was not fulfilling. So he got a master’sdegree in counseling and began a career as a therapist. He quickly discoveredthat the worlds of business and counseling were far apart. In business, he hadalways learned “to get results, no matter what”; in therapy, he discovered thatit was all about the process. “The process is the end itself,” he says. “Youjust need therapy.” That dichotomy felt unsatisfying, so Williams tookcourses—in neurolinguistic programming, hypnosis and touch for health,educational kinesiology and reiki— in search of more effective treatments tohelp clients make positive changes in their lives. “I was also frustrated by thelimitations of the old counseling formula of ‘insight + willpower = change,’Williams says. “Many of my clients, up to their eyeballs in insights about howand why they had become the way they were, were still not experiencing thesatisfying lives they sought.” Then one very frustrating December day broughtWilliams the answer. He had spent the day putting together a mailing to promotehis counseling services and encountered all the maddeningly familiar printer andphotocopier challenges. When he finally gave up, he fled to his garden and saton a half-frozen lawn chair. Still fuming, he said out loud, “Okay god, if youdon’t want me to do what I’m doing, what do you want me to do?”Not considering himself susceptible to spiritual experiences, Williams didn’texpect an answer. But to his astonishment, he recalls, “within minutes, thedetails of a pattern for changing subconscious beliefs showed up in my head,like on a teleprompter.” He ran to his computer and typed what he had seen, mostof which was new to him. That was the beginning of PSYCH-K®. We meet in a SanFrancisco hotel that looks out over the bay. In the distance is Alcatraz, oncethe site of a notorious prison. Today, the spooky empty buildings are a populartourist destination. Staring in the direction of Alcatraz, Williams says: “Manypeople are prisoners of their own beliefs. PSYCH-K® is all about breaking out ofthese prisons.” He is an articulate and rapid-fire speaker, still more the can-do executive than the counselor comfortable with long pauses. But there is alsowarmth and passion in his eyes and voice. After almost 25 years, Williams isproud to have trained about 40 PSYCH-K® facilitators around the world. There isno aggressive PSYCH-K® marketing machine, no desperate attempts to getpublicity. The therapy and training are available for those who find them andare ready for them. Authenticity and sincerity are hallmarks of Williams’approach. PSYCH-K® works with sets of paired statements, such as “The universeis a friendly place” and “The universe is an unfriendly place” or “I love myself” and “I hate myself.” Research has shown that the subconscious directs thebody’s motor functions and controls muscle movements, so PSYCH-K® uses themusculature to communicate with the subconscious. It’s the same idea as behindlie detectors, which measure skin conductivity. When someone is lying, theybecome tense, which raises their blood pressure, then makes them sweat, and thusincreases skin conductivity. Measuring differences in muscle tension can lead tosimilar results, such as whether someone really agrees with self-reverentialstatements like “I respect myself ” or “I do my best, and my best is goodenough.” The goal: to discover which self-limiting beliefs individuals mightsubconsciously be holding. “You can repeat affirmations until you are blue inthe face,” Williams says. “It seldom makes any difference. Most of the time,it’s not about positive thinking. It’s not about, ‘Oh, cancel. I don’t want thatthought.’ You already had the thought. So until you change the basic software ofthe subconscious, your hard drive, your life won’t change.” The problem is thatour subconscious ‘records’ experiences from our earliest moments onwards. “weare brought into this world into various cultures that have a whole bunch ofmindsets already in place for us” Williams explains. “we start internalizingthose even before we are out of the womb. Your parents start to treat you in away that fits the society’s norms and their own beliefs. By the time you’re 12years old, generally speaking, you are quite asleep at the wheel of your ownlife because you are ‘inculturated’ by whatever your culture and your parentssay is true and right. That’s not all bad. But you want to change the beliefsthat are not serving you, that are limiting you in some way.”When muscle tension reveals a disagreement between your conscious desires andyour subconscious beliefs, the process of reprogramming can begin. For this, itis critical to “speak the language of the subconscious,” Williams says. Thesubconscious mind thinks literally, he argues, so the simple thought, “I want tobe happy” is too vague. You have to specify the details of your goal, and youhave to do so in sensory-based language. What will you see in your life when youhave accomplished your goal? what will you hear other people saying about you?How will you feel when you have succeeded, and where in your body will you feelthat? PSYCH-K® also uses what Williams calls “belief points” on the body. Theseacupuncture points from Chinese medicine relate to specific organs associatedwith certain emotions: the heart for love, the lungs for self-esteem. Addressingthese points helps release the physical blockages associated with self- limitingbeliefs. Still, there is something magical about the experience, Williams says:“Magic is possible in the world, but you don’t do it until you are wise enoughto use it properly.”Williams first tested his new approach on himself and a few close friends. “Ifelt physical changes in my body,” he recalls. “I was astounded, because I’m notthat sensitive. I don’t feel things in my body, but I did then.” He vividlyremembers his first major case with a client, a woman addicted to smoking anddrinking who came to him from a rehab center. She also had Crohn’s disease.After about 45 minutes into her first PSYCH-K® session, on a massage table inWilliams’ office, she said: “I don’t know what, but something just happened.” “Isaid, ‘That’s great, I don’t know either,’” Williams recalls. “A few monthslater, I heard from the woman that the doctors who had diagnosed her Crohn’sdisease couldn’t find it anymore. New tests and X-rays didn’t show anything. Thedoctors said that they must have misdiagnosed because Crohn’s is an incurabledisease. This was my first major indicator that I was onto something.” Williamsexplains how he believes the healing works: “All these supposedly ‘incurable’diseases aren’t so incurable after all. That ‘incurable’ really means incurablefrom the outside. If you want to interrupt a physical process called disease,you need to leverage belief systems that will activate biological responses thatwill trigger a self-healing response.PSYCH-K® does not heal anything. It is a catalyst for the body to heal itself.The mind is the doctor. The pharmacy is in your head. With the right instructionby the mind, our bodies produce all kinds of things that are similar to thedrugs that are made by the pharmaceutical industry. “It is very simple: If youhave a disease, and all of a sudden you have an altered subconscious belief thatyour body is in perfect health, a dynamic tension arises. That tension has to beresolved in favor of the consciousness because that comes from a higher energydimension. And consciousness will use all the magnificent resources of themind-body system to make that new reality come true.” IN ABOUT 80 PERCENT OFCASES, THE changes are long lasting, according to Williams. He compares theprocess with a word-processing program on your computer: “You change a documentand you press the save command. That’s the version that remains. You don’t openthe document the next day to find that is has changed to an earlier version.It’s the same thing with PSYCH-K®. There is literally an edit and a save commandin the process. You can take that same thing that you have done and overanalyzedfor years and you write some new ‘software’, and then that becomes what you bootup with in the morning.” where PSYCH-K® fails is mostly in terms of whatWilliams calls “secondary gains.” “Somebody may say: ‘I want to get well and getback to work,” he says. “And then, when they do, they find that they are missingsomething. They were getting attention, for instance, when they were sick. Adisability was also ability for them to get something else. In such cases,people may fall back to old behavior.”Listening to Williams I realize that while we are listening to dysfunctionalpolitical debates in most western capitals and read about the damage done by bigbusiness to society, we are also on a high-speed track toward a healthier andwiser world. Just think about it: If more people embrace opportunities forpersonal transformation offered by programs like PSYCH-K®, more people willbecome happier and more aligned with their own life’s mission. Many of us arechanging and because of that the societies around us are bound to change too.Williams also focuses on the business community. “Most of the business peoplemaking decisions that are trashing the planet don’t want to do that,” he says.“They just do not know any other way. In order for them to get out of thesedestructive patterns, they have to be able to change their subconsciousbeliefs.” He pauses, and then adds, “In today’s society, money management is themost important skill. That’s wrong. Mind management is the most critical skill.If you manage your mind, you will always be in a good state.” There are bigbooks that describe the different psychological disorders. I think there isreally only one disorder: I call it ‘the illusion of separation’. If you believeyou are separate from the source of all that is and separate from each other,you will have all kinds of problems in your life. The illusion of separationgives us the idea that we can harm somebody else and not harm ourselves at thesame time. You can’t bomb another country if you realize that these kids are ourkids. You cannot make a decision in New York City or São Paulo to destroy arainforest if you know that forest is part of the eco-system that your lifedepends on.Ultimately Williams sees PSYCH-K® as an instrument for spiritual growth: “Ithink we all have one purpose and that’s to manifest our full divinity while weare incarnated in physical bodies.” At the same time, he observes that fewpeople pursue this highest of goals: “I think the biggest misuse of PSYCH-K® isthat people settle for too little. All they want is money or health or the rightpartner, all those things that people think they want. But if they get them,they find they are hopelessly inadequate to get what they really need. Thesethings don’t produce the stuff that really counts—love, joy, purpose,satisfaction and peace. In fact, they are often distractions to that.” Someonemay say, ‘I want $10 million.’ But if you delve deeper you will eventually comedown to an emotion, an intangible. That person wants to be happy. People thinkthey need tangibles to get to the intangibles. They think they know what theywant; seldom do they know what they need.Laughter and music rise from the street beneath the window of the hotel. SanFrancisco is enjoying summer. My thoughts go back to the wizard in Fantasia asWilliams concludes: “Deciding what’s worth wanting is a lot harder then gettingwhat you want. I can teach you how to get what you want. If you believe you areseparate from the source of all that is and separate from each other, you willhave all kinds of problems in your life”Jurriaan Kamp added a missing piece to his subconscious and watched Fantasia forthe first time while writing this article.The Intelligent Optimist (formerly Ode) is an independent international mediaplatform focused on solutions, possibility and inspiration.

Ninety-five percent of the time, our life iscontrolled by the beliefs programmed in the subconscious mind. You may hold somepositive thoughts but that has very little influence on your life because of thelimited amount of time you actually run with your conscious mind. We are notlocked in to fate, because we have the freedom to change the way we respond tothe world. We are the masters of our genetics rather than the victim of ourhereditary traits. Our fate is really based on how we see the world or on how wehave been programmed to experience it. So whatever we programmed into our minds,those beliefs will shape not just our genetics but our behavior to conform tothose beliefs as well. If we have positive beliefs built in our minds, then ourbehavior and our genes will lead us to health and happiness, says Dr. BruceLipton, author of book, The Biology of Belief.“The ‘secret to life’ is BELIEF. Rather than genes, it is our beliefs thatcontrol our lives.” --Bruce Lipton, Ph.D Cellular Biologist, author of Biologyof BeliefThe good news is that we can reprogram our subconscious mind with positivebeliefs. Using PSYCH-K® process that was established in 1988, by RobertWilliams, you can easily rewrite beliefs that have been affecting you your wholelife in a matter of just minutes. Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy may havebrought a better understanding to why we behave as we do, but rarely succeed infundamentally, changing our lives through these methods. Another reason whypsychotherapy does not work is because it addresses only 40-bit processor (i.e.the conscious mind). While the enormous power of the 40 million bits processor,(i.e. the subconscious mind) is largely un-utilized. Helping clients changeself-limiting beliefs into self- empowering beliefs would greatly benefit them.Research has shown that the subconscious directs the body’s motor functions andcontrols muscle movements, so PSYCH-K® uses the musculature (kinesiology) tocommunicate with the subconscious. PSYCH-K® process has been successfully usedfor over 23 years by psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers,hypnotherapists, counselors, energy healers, professional performance coachesand general population. It is a whole-brain integration process, which increasesthe communication between both brain hemispheres that supports the subconsciousmind in the change process. This whole brain therapy gets to the root ofembedded problems, limiting beliefs. Since the challenges we experience in ourlives are really a result of an embedded problem with self-esteem or shame orguilt or grief or holding resentments, when you use this process you get to thesource and heal that. The problem is solved for good and people are able to livefreely and happily. It’s very quick.“Whole-Brain State is a significant contributor to human evolution. From aneuroscience perspective, it allows greater efficiency in the brain and enhancesboth conscious and subconscious processes. From a quantum perspective, it is thegateway to higher consciousness.” says Dr. Jeffrey Fannin, Director forCognitive Enhancement.PSYCH-K® is a profound and energizing experience. With this process people areable to tap into their core self-definitions. We do that with a series of newsuggestions, new definitions. It’s almost like post hypnotic suggestions wherethese new definitions replace the old ones. With this process we get to theembedded anxiety, that place of fear where they have a conflict on someunconscious level that’s triggering the anxiety to continue with theirself-sabotaging behaviors. We get to that. We heal that. Now, their consciousmind which wants to succeed, be happy, have healthy relationships, be prosperousand self-confident, is linked up with their subconscious mind which no longersabotages them and is totally in alignment with the plan to achieve their goals.It is a way to once and for all get you to the root of the problem, and notreplace one symptom with another which can happen in traditional therapy. Withthis process we resolve the core of the problem so people are not doing symptomsubstitution. They actually heal themselves.I am truly grateful to PSYCH-K® process. It has helped me to break-free frompast limitations. Utilizing it as the foundation of my practice, allows thesynergistic blend of many modalities including traditional psychotherapy tobenefit my clients’ transition from a belief of being powerless to beingempowered. This process makes sense, makes scientific sense. If you do not treatthe underlying cause of problems you cannot expect positive, long-term results.The power of the mind, the power of our beliefs is the platform to ‘curing’diseases. Self-defeating beliefs and behaviors are like being imprisoned behindiron bars with the door left ajar – all we need to do is walk through the doorbut our mind thinks it is impossible to ‘escape.’ Our clients have sought us outto change how life occurs for them. They rely upon us for the answers to releasethem from their life sentence. There is an epidemic of addictions and physicaland mental health related issues and it will continue to ramp up if we do notintervene with methods that can bring them positive and long-term results.This is what I would tell my peers. If you have a technique which actually healspeople where they’ve internalized really healthy, spiritual and cognitive andtherapeutic messages, it is great. If you can really heal people and send themon their way and then they lead fulfilling lives, excellent. But if there arelimitations to what you can do, if your clients aren’t able to go out fromtherapy and be independent, then maybe you should look into PSYCH-K®.Ignorance can kill us or, at the very least, kill our spirit. It is incumbentupon us, as professionals/healers to educate ourselves with the latesttechnologies, methods and processes to help those who come to us with greathope.“Heal thyself ” is not just an adage. I am living proof of the long-term andpositive results PSYCH K® creates. Every day is a gift and I am grateful for thewonderful life I have created with my husband. It is my honor to share thishighly effective process with those who are ready for a ‘real breakthrough’ inlife or want to help their clients/patients more effectively. This messagebrings hope and excitement to those individuals who have been feeling powerlessand living in fear.“I am a perpetual student.... I’m always open to acquire knowledge and learn newtools to help me on my life’s journey. I found PSYCH-K® to be of tremendousbenefit for me not only personally but also in my business. What I especiallyappreciate about PSYCH-K® is its simplicity. The techniques although simple areextremely effective.

Fannin, Ph.D.Robert M. Williams, M.A. The latest understandings in neuroscience are revealing important informationfor psychotherapists. This article is designed to inform you about some of thekey elements of those new understandings, including the importance ofsubconscious beliefs, the Whole-Brain State, and the basic mechanisms of themind/brain interface. All of which can assist you in being more effective withyour clients.Let’s begin by defining two key terms in this article. The first is belief. Thedictionary defines belief as, something one accepts as true or real; a firmlyheld opinion or conviction. From our perspective, the origin of beliefs can betraced back to conclusions drawn from past experience, i.e. fire can hurt mebecause I have had an experience with fire that demonstrated that truth! Beliefscan be both conscious and/or subconscious. The second term is, Whole-BrainState. This is a state of coherency in the brain, marked by a bilateral,symmetrical brain wave pattern, allowing for maximum communication/data flowbetween the left and right hemispheres of the brain. So, what do these termshave to do with psychotherapy? The surprising answer is…everything! If we acceptthat the overall goal of psychotherapy is to produce fully functional humanbeings, then being able to optimize belief systems and brain function is a majorfactor in accomplishing that goal. Consider the role of beliefs in our lives.Beliefs are like filters on a camera. What the camera “sees” is a function ofthe filters through which it is viewing its subject. In other words, how we“see” the world is a function of our beliefs, and profoundly influences ourpersonality. As a result of our beliefs, we define ourselves as worthy orworthless, powerful or powerless, competent or incompetent, trusting orsuspicious, belonging or outcast, self- reliant or dependent, flexible orjudgmental, fairly treated or victimized, loved or hated. Your beliefs havefar-reaching consequences, both positive and negative, in your life. Beliefsaffect your moods, relationships, job performance, self-esteem, physical health,even your religious or spiritual outlook. Most psychotherapists deal with one ormore of these issues on a regular basis with their clients. Clients are oftenplagued by beliefs that are self-limiting. Consequently, the ability to helpindividuals change self-limiting beliefs into self-empowering beliefs is ofgreat value in a psychotherapeutic environment.Beliefs can be conscious and/or subconscious. We are using the word conscious inits ordinary sense, as awareness of the environment. We are using the wordsubconscious, as awareness below the conscious level. Like a hard drive in acomputer, this is where most of the belief-system “software” is stored. And,like a computer memory, the data are stored, not in the central processing chipitself, but rather in the energy field that surrounds and interpenetrates thechip. There is an analogous relationship with the brain and mind, respectively.This “software” is largely responsible for our habitual thoughts and behaviors.Advances in neuroscience have provided important information about thesubconscious mind. For example, in a study cited in Harvard Professor emeritusGerald Zaltman’s book, How Customers Think, neuroscience reveals that at least95% of our thoughts and decisions originate at the subconscious level of themind. That leaves a very small percentage of our decision-making capacity forthe conscious mind to exercise. These subconscious beliefs create the perceptualfilters through which we respond to life’s challenges. So, while we may bemostly unaware of their influence on us, our subconscious beliefs largely‘direct’ our observable actions and behaviors. They form the basis for ouractions and reactions to each new situation in our lives.Another important quality of the subconscious mind is its processing capacity.In his book, The User Illusion, Cutting Consciousness Down To Size, author TorNorretranders, provides important information about the processing capacity ofthe conscious and subconscious minds.As remarkable as it may seem, the conscious mind processes information at anapproximate rate of 40 bits of information per second. While the subconsciousmind processes approximately 40 million bits of information per second.Ironically, most standard approaches to psychotherapy address only the 40- bitprocessor (i.e. the conscious mind). While the enormous power of the 40million-bit processor, (i.e. the subconscious mind), is largely un-utilized.What about the Whole-Brain State?A great deal of research has been conducted for decades on what has come to becalled “brain dominance” theory (also known as split-brain research). Thefindings of this research indicate that in general, each hemisphere of thecerebral cortex tends to specialize in, and preside over, different functions,process different kinds of information, and deals with different kinds ofproblems. 20.png [../images/00019.jpeg] It should be obvious from the qualities and characteristics described above,that ideal brain functioning would be the ability to simultaneously utilize bothsides of the cerebral cortex. However, life experiences often trigger adominance of one side over the other when responding to specific situations. Themore emotionally charged the experience (usually traumatic), the more likely itwill be stored for future reference, and the more likely we will automaticallyover-identify with only one hemisphere when faced with similar life experiencesin the future. As a psychotherapist, the ability to help clients achieve abalanced identification with both hemispheres of the brain, (i.e. theWhole-Brain State) with respect to past traumatic experiences, is paramount inhelping them to achieve a new perspective of their past. This new perspectivecan free them from the habitual perspective, held in the subconscious, which canmake a past trauma into a current nightmare. By re-perceiving a past traumaticexperience with new Whole-Brain “filters,” clients can be freed from theautomaticity of past perceptions, which limit their happiness and wellbeing.In addition to its usefulness as a tool for dealing more effectively with life’schallenges, past, present, and future, the Whole-Brain State has another majorbenefit. It can be used as a foundation for quickly and effectively changingself- limiting subconscious beliefs. The research that follows, utilizedPSYCH-K®, a popular system for subconscious change. This system has been used bypsychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, professional performance coaches,and others, for over 23 years. This is a testament to its versatility. In thehands of a professionally trained psychotherapist, it is an effectivetherapeutic tool. In the hands of a sports performance coach, it is as a way todramatically enhance sporting ability. Used as a tool by educators and parents,it can significantly help students achieve academic success.Healer Heal Thyself…and Your Clients too!The powerful influence of the Whole-Brain State was demonstrated in a studyreported in 1988 in the International Journal of Neuroscience, by researchers atthe Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. It suggests that synchronized brainstates significantly influence nonverbal communication. The study was done withthirteen paired subjects. The subjects were tested in a darkened and soundproofFaraday cage (a lead-lined, screened chamber, that filters out all outsideelectromagnetic activity). Each pair of subjects was instructed to close theireyes and try to “communicate” by becoming aware of the other’s presence and tosignal the experimenter when they felt it had occurred. The brainwave states ofthe subjects were monitored during this process.Experimenters reported that during the sessions an increase in similarity of EEG(electroencephalogram) patterns between the pairs of communicators developed.Furthermore, the experimenters noticed, “The subject with the highestconcordance [hemispheric integration] was the one who most influenced thesession.” In other words, when you are in a Whole-Brain State, your brain wavepattern can automatically affect your client in a very positive way, even beforeyou communicate verbally!These conclusions support the allegation that our thoughts, even nonverballyexpressed, can influence others. In fact, the more whole-brained we become, themore we influence others toward that state of being as well. The therapeuticbenefit of this kind of influence on therapists, as well as their clients isself- evident.QEEG and the Whole-Brain StateOur research gathering documented one hundred twenty-five (125) cases, with datagathered over 12 months in three different locations, utilizing different EEGtechnicians, using two different types of EEG equipment; the result of thisinvestigation produced a pvalue of <=0.010.A baseline of EEG (electroencephalogram) data was established for each case.Three baseline readings of five minutes each was recorded; five minutes eyesopen, five minutes eyes closed and five minutes with the brain on task (silentlyreading a magazine). A Certified PSYCH-K® Facilitator, used standard PSYCH-K®(corporate version is identified as PER- K®) practices. This is a process forsubconscious belief change to achieve the whole-brain state. Following theintervention of the PSYCH-K® change process (aka a balance), a post-intervention EEG was recorded in the same manner as the EEG baseline statedabove. The balance took approximately 10 minutes to complete.Raw EEG data was artifacted to eliminate eye movement, tongue movement,swallowing, or other unwanted disturbances in the EEG. NeuroStat, a function ofthe Neuroguide program from Applied Neuroscience, performed statisticalanalysis. NeuroStat allows for individual independent t-tests to be performed.The following is an example from the base of 125 cases examined for thewhole-brain state. The independent t-test compares condition A to condition Band shows if there are differences in the dominant brain function, when weconsider Shannon’s method of statistical analysis [4], we understand that whenwe measure two groups, A and B, (such as pre-balance and post-balance) each ofthem having a well defined probability distribution, respectively, as well as ajoint probability distribution, then the mutual information between A and B isdefined. The concept of mutual information can easily be extended to quantumsystems of entanglement. This leads us to understand that having quantum mutualinformation, which, for a general state of either A and/or B is now defined andprovides the basis by which the relationship can be understood, a sampledepiction of the whole-brain state seen in below: 25.png [../images/00020.jpeg] To better understand the scientific significance of this report, understandingthe significance of pvalue will help to put this research into perspective. Instatistical significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining atest statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed. Whenthe result falls at 0.05 or 0.01 is said to be statistically significant. In thecase of the Fannin-Williams research a very high degree of statisticalsignificance occurred,<=0.010. This indicates that the relationship between thetwo phenomena is highly significant and not a function of chance. The colors onthe independent t-test show phenomena A (dominant brainwave pattern)BEFORE the PSYCH-K® balance is depicted in RED, left side and phenomena B(dominant brainwave pattern) AFTER the PSYCH-K® balance was facilitated isdepicted in BLUE, right side. The whole-brain state is considered to be thecombination of RED, left side; condition A, dominance prior to the balanceprocess, and condition B, right side, dominance after the balance process wasfacilitated.Due to the space restriction of this article, it is not possible to provide acomprehensive treatment of this subject, or the numerous changes that a majorityof subjects in this research experienced. However, the volume of data collected,and the unique properties it represents, afford us the opportunity to evaluateand continue to understand what the data means, as well as providing intriguinghints as to the nature of its potential. Singularly, the most significantinformation to come from this research, in 98% of the cases measured, presentedvery high statistically significant correlations, demonstrating the differencebetween baseline measures and the presence of the whole-brain state after theintervention occurred. As mentioned above, just because the whole-brain state ispresent does not mean that it is being continually activated, so the person cantake full advantage of it in a given situation. Sometimes secondary gain issuescome into play, or other subconscious belief patterns that may need to beaddressed in order to effectively activate and/or allow the person to fully usethe whole-brain state.The whole-brain state is better understood with some education regarding a fewof its more unfamiliar components. Figure 1 uses the term coherence. This is anenergy signature. In physics, coherence is a property of waves that enablesstationary a temporally and spatially constant to brainwave function. Moregenerally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation betweenphysical quantities of a wave. This is important in order to understand thephysics of resonating wave patterns in the brain, its connection to thewhole-brain state, and how it impacts our behavior.An additional component to the whole-brain state is identified as constructiveand destructive interference patterns. If two waves are interacting with oneanother in such a way that they combine to create a wave of greater amplitudethan either one by itself, the result is called constructive interference.Constructive interference is said to occur when waves are in-phase with oneanother. However, if the waves interfere with each other in such a way as todiminish the amplitude of the other, a destructive interference pattern iscreated. In this case, the waves are said to be out-of-phase with each other.Phase is important in brainwave patterns, just as it is in other principles ofphysics. That is to say, two waves are said to be coherent if they have aconstant relative phase. The degree of coherence is measured by the interferencevisibility, a measure of how perfectly the waves can cancel due to destructiveinterference. Cancellation is virtual or local since a wave cannot have negativeenergy. 27.png [../images/00021.jpeg] Constructive Interference as seen in Figure 2, for example, would be like twosets of ripples moving across the surface of water toward each other, as seen indepiction A. Both wave A and B are moving toward each other with their ripplesin-phase, in this case both waves are leading with their negative amplitude.Their cycle patterns are aligned. The waves merge together at the interfacewhere two ripples meet. The consequences of this merger, the waves are drawnwith one above the other as seen in middle depiction B. The common expressionof, being in rapport, or in sync, or on the same wavelength with someone, is anexample of how this concept is relevant to therapist/ client relationships.Destructive Interference, as seen in Figure 3, for example, the ripples might bebest understood when thought of as waves created when a pebble is dropped intowater. Wave A in depiction B, are moving from left to right. Wave B in depictionB, moving right to left, wave B represents the ripples from a second pebbledropped shortly after the first. Since the pebbles did not enter the water atthe same time, the waves will not be aligned when they merge they will be “outof phase.” The physics of a destructive interference pattern has wave A isleading with negative amplitude and wave B is leading with positive amplitude.Where they meet the waves are a mirror image of each other. As shown indepiction C, the amplitude values of each wave cancel each other out[5].The significance of this principle of physics is fundamental to the coherence ofthe whole-brain state. Allowing brainwave energy to be more focused andeffective at resolving problems and accessing information with ability to notonly resonate properly to influence brain function, but also interact withsubconscious beliefs.Emotional Engagement and Subconscious BeliefsFrom a neuroscience perspective, the basis for understanding why we experienceparticular emotions is centered in the relationship between the anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala. The amygdala, usually thought of as thefear detector, also detects all other emotions. It responds to fear because itprocesses emotions in order of their significance. So, when fear is the mostsignificant emotion in the brain, the amygdala will respond [6]. When fear isthe most dominant emotion in your thinking, it taxes the subconscious mind,which does most of the fast processing of information. 28.png [../images/00022.jpeg] For example, if a person who left a secure job to pursue her dreams, started toread statistics about how unlikely it was to be a successful entrepreneur, theamygdala would likely have been stimulated, making her more anxious. As aresult, her subconscious fears would be active even when she was thinking aboutother things. Scientific experiments found that when fearful facial expressionswere shown so that people did not know they had seen them, the amygdala wasstill activated. 29.png [../images/00023.jpeg] The amygdala is connected to multiple brain regions. One of those regions is thefrontal lobe, where many important decisions are processed. If the amygdala isactivated, the activation affects various regions in the frontal lobe,particularly the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and thereafter affectsdecision-making, as well as emotional centers. We can recognize that we arevulnerable to fear and anxiety in such a way that it compromises our ownabilities to attend to relevant content. The impact of this is that it consumesour thinking resources. We should also understand that the amygdala is theemotional relevance detector rather than just a fear detector. The amygdala-PFCconnection is important because a part of it acts as short-term memory andanother part as the “accountant” in the brain calculating risks and benefits ofour thinking. Subconscious threats over-activate the amygdala and lead to adecline in thinking and productivity when we focus on negative statements suchas:• “How am I ever going to keep up with everything? What if I fail?”• “What if I can’t afford food, gas, healthcare on what I make?”• “The government is not doing much to help me or my family, so the odds forsuccess are stacked against me.• “What if I get laid off?”• “I’m not smart enough to be successful.”These kinds of negative thought patterns can create what could be identified asan amygdala hijacking. The amygdala kicks into action in preparation for “fightor flight,” creating unacceptable levels of anxiety and fear at a subconsciouslevel that negatively impact our behavior and productivity. This subconsciouspatterning becomes part of the default network and will keep us focused onlooking out for danger. The authors of this paper contend that entering intowhat we call the whole-brain state will move the brain out of the negativedefault mode and allow access to more resourceful thinking processes.High-speed mindset change taught in PSYCH-K® and/or PeR-K® is an effectivemethod for identifying and changing the conflict between the conscious andsubconscious beliefs.Worry is another component related to normal brain function. It is the brain’sresponse to fear, it is thought of as a response of the brain to block outnegative emotions that reside in the subconscious. Some neuroscientists havesuggested that worry is a strategy of cognitive avoidance in which internalverbalization acts to suppress threatening emotional imagery. It is believedthat worry leads to missing important negative information such as risk that maybe relevant to making optimal decisions. This information is mostlysubconscious. Worry disrupts the “brain-bridge” (corpus callosum) and slows thetransfer time across from the left to the right hemisphere.Taking additional time for processing without creating a solution to theproblem. People who are constantly worried, often see this worry as an attemptto find a solution, but may in fact be stuck in worry. That usually keepsproductivity to a minimum. The whole-brain state increases communication betweenthe left and right hemispheres of the brain, and speeds up the transfer ofinformation across the corpus callosum, thereby diminishing the capacity toworry without excluding or ignoring important information leading to aproductive behavior. 30.png [../images/00024.jpeg] The authors of this paper point to the research herein, which suggests that, theWhole-Brain state allows access to the inter-hemispheric activity connecting tomore efficient brain function. Further, we would have you understand that fromthe research presented here we identify the whole-brain state as a bi-lateral,symmetrical brain wave pattern allowing access to positive mood and cognitiveopenness.In conclusion, we suggest that this research demonstrates a significantconnection between beliefs, (especially at the subconscious level of the mind),the Whole-Brain State, and high-speed mindset change, as well as their relevantutility to psychotherapists.The data presented here strongly suggests a correlation between the state ofmind of the psychotherapist and the state of the mind of the patient/client.Hence, the relevancy of doing psychotherapy from a Whole-Brain State, with theappropriate subconscious belief systems, in order to be optimally effective as acatalyst for change.References1) Zaltman G.

When I embarked upon this journey of healing and self-exploration, I did not know that I would reach this far in my understanding, hadit not been for Reiki and its touch of gentle awareness, I would not have foundthe insights that led me to accomplish my work as a student and teacher of NonDual Awareness.Reiki is simple yet mysterious like the creation itself. And it is a blessingthat this energy is available to us today to guide our way through the chaos ofthe planetary transition. I have shared my extensive experience andunderstanding of Reiki in my books, but here I will share something, which isnot just limited to Reiki practice, rather it applies for any spiritual orcreative pursuit that you might be having.For any effort to sustain and bear fruit, for any practice to become a way oflife, for any essence to become fully manifested one needs to learn the art ofself- motivation. Hundreds of seminars, books and other educational content arecreated on this subject and yet we all know how difficult it is for our mind tobecome attuned and focused with a practice, bringing consistency and intensityin the effort.Motivation cannot be fostered without cultivating the right perspective aboutthe practice and our role as the practitioner. To know the strengths andweaknesses of our mind, to know the pitfalls in the realm of thoughts andemotions, to realize the amount of effort needed to cultivate discipline, forall this we need to understand the highest aspect of Motivation. If we try tocontrol or tame our mind, try to enforce discipline it does not work in the longterm, only by natural spontaneous motivation driven by a higher purpose thatitself is evolutionary and makes our awareness expand, only such a motivationcan sustain itself and help our practice to become immaculate.Motivation is a force for all our endeavors; however this force also needs asubtle force to work on it, which is the realization of the purpose. Reiki orUniversal Life Force energy when practiced with right perception and claritybrings this much-needed realization and thus the spark of highest motivation isignited.When this motivation is present inside us, it propels us to practice everythingthat is in accordance with our evolution. It helps us attain a holistic view oflife and an awareness of our potential to manifest our fullness of being.Had it not been for Reiki, I also would not have had the motivation to do thework that I have done. Reiki’s presence and influence in my life is the causefor successful journey that I had as a teacher and guide. So, I am sharing herean excerpt from my book ‘The Ultimate Reiki Touch’ which elucidates the mutualrelationship between the practice of Reiki and the force of motivation. Eachfosters the other and takes us forward into a fulfilling life.Motivation is a very important aspect to understand and work on if we areserious about anything in life, because everything in our life is decided by thelevel and quality of our motivation. A life without motivation is stagnant andsick. So it is important that we learn about this essential element of everypractice and what better way than to study it in the context of Reiki practice,as Reiki fosters motivation. I wish that this excerpt completely conveys thesignificance and true understanding of motivation and its role in any practice,so that the readers may be inspired to cultivate this perspective and makeprogress on their path.“The most desirable motivation in life is to be helpful and responsible. It isalso the most fitting motivation for Reiki. When we approach Universal LifeForce energy with the intention of helping ourselves and others, this altruisticimpulse supports us in remaining open and receptive. When we are open andreceptive, we do not tend to narrow the potential of the energy by trying tomake it fit our perceptions and short sighted imagined needs, even treatingourselves with such openness is altruistic, because it deflates the selfishcontrol of the mind by exposing it to the vastly beneficial presence ofUniversal Life Force energy.Reiki blossoms and flourishes at its best when we take responsibility for ourown well being. In fact, through the practice of Reiki, we express our firmconviction that, as vessels of Universal Life Force energy, we ourselves are thecreator and therefore responsible for our own health, happiness and welfare.Step by step, the more we venture into the healing powers of Reiki, we alsocease being the victim of circumstances. Instead, we continue to grow intotaking full responsibility, first for our physical health and emotional balance.Later we also learn to take responsibility for our entire life and all thecircumstances we attract, never again blaming any outside force for whatever mayoccur.This responsibility has nothing to do with an ego-inflated sense of falsegrandeur. Rather it amounts to a gentle surrender to the greater power that wetruly are. It all begins with the simple wish to be helpful and responsible inour everyday lives. Over time, Reiki then naturally, influences us to wish forourselves and all sentient beings, bliss and the cause of bliss, and to be freedof all suffering. Simultaneously it influences us to efficiently apply ourselvesto the manifestation of that same intention.The ProcessHealing Begins at HomeIf we are drawn to Reiki or are considering learning and practicing the UsuiMethod of Natural Healing, by the very power of this wish, we kindle the sparkof the supreme motivation in us to heal and be healed. If we act on thisintuition, it follows easily that we will then be moved to cultivate theuniversal human qualities of love, compassion, joy and equanimity. At first,this motivation may seem to last for only a split second, to come and go like aflash of lightning in the darkness. However brief it may appear to be, if we fanthis spark, it will not only plant but also strengthen the seed for a desire toliberate both ourselves and others from physical illness, mental stress andemotional conflict and turmoil.To fulfill the purpose of healing, we don’t have to be immaculately selfless,either. Selfless motivation does not require that we think only of others. Itsimply requires that we focus on whatever is wholesome. If we wish for healing,for love, compassion, joy and equanimity for all sentient beings, this wish hasto begin at home, with us. In fact, if we truly wish to heal anyone, we firsthave to heal ourselves.At the highest order of understanding, healing is not an issue, because fromthis perspective there was (and never will be) anything wrong or out of order tobegin with. However it takes time and skillful observation to fully appreciatethe true silence and completeness of all beings, including ourselves before itcan be expressed as wholeness and healing in the human body. Only after we havehad glimpses of such wholeness in our human body can we inspire similarexperience with others. That is why it is so important to experience this ever-present wholeness in us first.To heal our families and us is part of Reiki tradition. Mrs. Takata was quiteadamant about the correct order of things, when she stated something to theeffect: First, heal yourself, then heal your family, only after that go out anddo healing sessions outside of your immediate circle of family and friends. Ofcourse, we can follow all three approaches simultaneously. We can practice self-treatment, treat members of our family and share additional treatments withothers (If we indeed want to be of consistent help to ourselves and to others).It is important, however to take into account our own resources and not spreadourselves too thin. Notwithstanding all of the above, during the initial firsttwenty-one days of Reiki practice; it is essential to treat as many differentpeople as possible in order to gain confidence in our own ability to conveyReiki.Liberation from Hypnosis by BeliefsAlthough the day-to-day world is not the real world, but a dream or fictionprojected by the mind, we still have to take into consideration the effect ofthis dream’s hypnotic power over us. From the fact that everyone is by groupconsensus hypnotized into believing in this world of restriction, we have toconclude, that for the hypnotized, restriction is very much a reality.Limitation and restriction are therefore the codes we are led to live by, aslong as we are subject to the hypnotic influence of the body/mind’s acceptanceof the collective unconscious so-called reality.To give an example: As everyone unquestioningly subscribes to the arbitrary andeven downright destructive and exploitative rules of today’s so called ‘economicrealities’, we cannot empty our bank accounts to give away every last penny tothe needy. If we did what the Native Americans sometimes did, by giving away alltheir material possessions in a ceremony they called the ‘great give away’, wewould very soon be stripped of any means to help either ourselves or others. Wewould bankrupt ourselves in the process. This is because humans over manycenturies have been mass hypnotized into the belief that ‘having’ is better than‘giving’: that lack is more real than abundance.If we lived in a society that valued a woman or a man for what they gave awayrather than for what they kept in excess, we could give much more freely.Energies between humans would be exchanged in a much more natural flow than theyare now. Everyone would then not be conditioned to grab as much as they can andhang onto it for as long as conceivably possible – that is until death do uspart.As long as we remain identified with our human body, we inevitably become a partof the mass hypnosis of our particular culture. We are compelled to operatewithin the beliefs of that same culture, however silly or ridiculous they maybe. After all, we can only give what we perceive ourselves to have.Through the practice of Reiki, over time, more and more limitations fall away.We are then able to give more, for we begin to recognize in truth the vastabundance already available to us. The motivation to fend only for oneself,transforms to encompass the omnipresent ‘beingness’ that we and all others ARe-and the imagined little ‘self ’ falls away.Reiki is not an Ego Based PursuitThe belief in human limitation, lack and loneliness begins to dissolve whenthrough energy medicine we receive the first inkling of potential healing andwholeness inherent in our lives. When, a desire for such healing arises if onlyfor a moment, it reveals the innate yearning of Heart for Heart. It is thesupreme motivation for the complete liberation of all beings, which we need tolovingly fuel and expand to the farthest reaches of our existence.If we do not fuel and expand our motivation, it cannot be sustained. We willforget about it. Seemingly more pressing matters in our everyday lives willinterfere, and we will fall back into the belief that we need to struggle inorder to survive. There will always be something else that vies for ourattention until our desire for healing is completely forgotten and buried underthe never-ending routine of our mundane existence.If we fail to nourish the spark for real truth and freedom, it will certainlydie. It will not grow into the all consuming and inner mounting flame of thecompassion of a true healer who has experienced and thus acknowledged theever-present grace to heal self and others. In this respect, the desire forhealing is very much connected to the desire for the freedom ofself-realization. At the highest level they are one and the same. Ultimatehealing can only happen in ultimate freedom.If the desire for freedom is continuous, then all the habits and distractions ofmind will drop. Think only of freedom and you become freedom because you arewhat you think.The desire for freedom is the high tide,which will wipe out the sand castles of doubt. -PapajiIf we do not nourish, the spontaneous and selfless aspiration to heal, to befree, and complete, more and more obscurations in the form of the ordinarytendencies will sneak back in our mind, until they finally take over anddominate our lives. Whenever the supreme motivation for true healing and freedomis not kept vibrant, the obscurations, like pride, greed, aversion, lust anddelusion, will contaminate our aspirations. The desire for self-aggrandizementmay replace the wish to heal. Under their sway, our Reiki practice can becomevery narrow minded and self-serving. It can become an ego game.We may then have the tendency to style ourselves in the ‘big healer’, and beginto be very concerned about this new self-image. We may feel urge to pretend tobe more than who we are, perceive ourselves as knowing more than we do. We maybe tempted to make others believe for example that we have done Reiki forfifteen years, whereas we took our First degree class only a little over fouryears ago. We may claim to have had experiences that we have only read about inbooks. Another typical result of ego-based Reiki is that we may be compelled toadd accouterments to the basic practice in order to stand out and be special.Instead of following our deepest aspirations, we may fall prey to the businessof marketing our ill begotten specialness.None of the above is conducive to the purpose of healing. Instead, it onlycreates confusion in us and others. Inevitably, it stirs up the proliferation ofthoughts, concepts and emotions, which actually are the very aspects of ourexistence, which are at the root of all imbalance and disease. Thoughts andemotions need to be pacified, not stirred up. Therefore, turning Reiki into anego pursuit is very counterproductive and can only dampen its liberating spirit.Ego centered Reiki is never in alignment with the supreme motivation of ultimatehealing.The TipPractice Helps Explore Our Real MotivesHow exactly can we nourish and support the motivation for freedom, for healing?First, by strengthening the desire because inevitably we always attract, what wedesire most. The challenge is, that most of the time, we are not even aware ofthe motives of our actions. Very few people are aware of their true motives andso for most they are ill defined.Quite often the mind subconsciously stays focused on what it resists, andtherefore attracts exactly that. For most people, personal motives remainsomewhat vague. As a result, they often get exactly what they don’t want, oreven detest. The reason for all this is lack of focus or awareness of what theyreally wanted in the first place.To strengthen the desire for healing, a simple way is to practice the UsuiMethod of Natural Healing in a consistent manner. It will help us to remainaware of our deepest aspirations and selfless motives. We can acquire a markedsense of accomplishment with the use of Reiki in the same manner that weaccomplish ordinary, mundane goals. For example: If we want to become aprofessional dancer, we have to train to develop both our physical strength andendurance as well as become proficient in the steps and moves. We have to watcha lot of performances in order to imbibe the grace of the experts. If ourmotivation is to become a pianist, we have to practice the piano and listen torecordings of many great pianists. In fact, if we want to do anything reallywell, we cannot afford to take it for granted that we already know everythingabout it or that we have reached the pinnacle of accomplishment. To allow suchan attitude, is a sure way to have our motivation wither on the vine. Therefore,in order to become proficient with Reiki, we need to practice a lot of Reiki,and preferably on many different bodies.All of this is very obvious, but as humans, we often tend to miss the obvious.Our minds are sometimes too clever for our own good, always ‘futurizing’ andfabricating abstract ideas. We most often don’t see the tree because our mindsare preoccupied with the concept of ‘forest’. We may talk about how great andwonderful Reiki is, but may actually shy away from using the energy in thepresent moment, because of the possible feelings that might come up. Soonthereafter, if we continually follow the avoidance impulse, we will easilyforget about Reiki, and in all likelihood, also forget our motivation forhealing, wholeness and freedom, until it pops up as another glimmer ofunsustainable hope and short lived enthusiasm at some point in the distantfuture.The only chance we will ever have to free ourselves from the pull of thisdownward spiral into mass un-consciousness is to practice Reiki, provided ofcourse, that Reiki is what we want to do. Once we begin and get into a flow, itbecomes effortless. The practice itself and its ensuing benefits become ourmotivation. Consequently, practice endows us eventually with more and moreexperience. Experience, in turn, feeds motivation. Motivation then againinspires us to continue practicing, and so forth, creating a sustained upwardspiral.The Heartfelt Desire to Live in the MomentSelfless motivation is an essential point, because where our motivation directsus, is where our Reiki practice is going to lead us. We want our practice to beexpansive, in order for us to grow and become expansive ourselves. Howeverselfless motivation does not infer that we should abandon all self interest forthe sake of an abstract and unlivable ideal of altruistic purity. This would beas nonsensical as total selfishness, because such false construed altruisticpurity amounts to just another form of denial.Selfless motivation simply means that it is our heartfelt desire to continuouslynotice in every moment now, the original, all encompassing goodness, alwayspresent in us and in others from beginningless time; noticing goodness for ourown sake and for the sake of all sentient beings, wherever they are in thisvastly immense universe.Selfless motivation helps our practice to become all-inclusive and moreexpansive. It counteracts any tendency toward narrow mindedness. If our solemotivation, for example is self-aggrandizement, only to become rich and famousthrough Reiki, this idea will seriously restrict the possibilities and impactour practice can have. We would then only do things designed to advance our ownagenda. Everything that doesn’t would be pushed aside. We need to ask ourselves:Is this worthy conduct for someone who calls him or herself a ‘healer’?And what would the repercussions be of such behavior on our entire outlook onlife and the way we practice Reiki? How would it compromise our awareness of thecontinuous availability of Universal Life Force energy? These are some of theissues which are important to notice and feel, for they are sure traps whichlead one backward into a more solidified identification with ego or a separatesense of ‘self ’, which is the root cause of all suffering.Since Reiki is in itself limitless, the scope of our motivation needs to matchthe very limitedness of Universal Life Force energy. When we want to use Reikiin a meaningful way, the only choice we have, is to do it for the highest goodof all concerned. Regular Reiki practice will strongly support such an openattitude, provided we allow ourselves to directly feel and experience theenergy, instead of imprisoning it in concepts. If we allow ourselves to feel andsavor the energy, we will also automatically feel and express the fourimmeasurable qualities of love, compassion, joy and equanimity as naturalexpressions of Reiki for highest good of all concerned.Dr. Paula Horan has a rich lineage of Reiki Masters traced right back to Dr.Usui, who placed a great importance not only on regular Reiki Practice but alsoon the importance of the Reiki Attitude.

Most people spend their time thinking about all thethings they do not want, and then wonder why the same thing shows up repeatedlyin their life. When we give attention to something, the energy flows through usand expands and charges the object of our attention. Focusing on what we dowant, rather than what we do not want in our life, is the key to attracting allthe best things into one’s own life. Our thoughts not only matter, they creatematter. Thought is where everything comes from. The universe is made ofconsciousness - and matter and energy are just two of the forms thatconsciousness takes. Therefore, in all effect, thoughts create the physicalworld. And once we comprehend that everything is energy then there is nodistinction between matter and energy – and the boundaries of the physical worldand the world of our thoughts start to fade away as well.Beliefs are only thoughts….Our beliefs are only thoughts. So although wellbeing is abundantly available tous, our mind role playing as the gatekeeper, determines how much of it weexperience. Our thoughts and beliefs are the deciding factors to how much weopen the gates of abundance. The more positive our beliefs, the gates openwider!Although negative thoughts seemingly have a lot of power, they are really justthoughts that have been thought about, repeatedly. This then proceeds and takeson the form of reality. Their power is attributed only to the energy we chooseto give them. And with The Law of Attraction set in motion, these then onlycontribute to a snowballing effect – of transforming from a purely energy realminto the physical realm. When we repeatedly think certain thoughts, they takethe form of beliefs. The Universe then is left with no choice but to deliver tous, what we choose to believe!However, in the end, beliefs are just thoughts. With some effort we can changethem and our lives!In the wide spectrum of alternate healing modalities, available today,ThetaHealing® stands out as an extremely powerful yet gentle form of “energy”healing. It has the potential to resolve an enormous range of physical,emotional, financial and spiritual issues. Post Theta sessions, one tends toexperience enhanced wellbeing, abundance and joy.The ProcessHow ThetaHealing® works:The theta brain wave state has been scientifically verified and measured byelectroencephalography (EEG) lab tests. We are in a theta brain state every day;at the moment when we first wake up and just before we fall asleep. It is anextremely powerful brain wave to use for healing and manifesting. Other types ofbrain wave states are beta (when you are studying or in conversation), alpha(light meditation or taking a bath), and delta (deep sleep).What makes ThetaHealing® a unique and powerful form of healing is the ability ofthe practitioner to get into a theta brain wave state (deep meditation), andfacilitate a healing from god (Source/Creator) for the recipient. The healerthen witnesses the healing. The healer’s role is to be a clear channel for thehealing from Source. We are all interconnected in a web of consciousness thatholds infinite possibilities. ThetaHealing® simply taps into that web forpositive transformation and healing for the highest and best.ThetaHealing® realigns and re-balances your energy field, while also removingenergy blocks from traumas, diseases and accidents. These energy blocks cancause physical (including genetic), financial, emotional, mental and/orspiritual issues and challenges. As a result of the ThetaHealing® sessions,harmony and balance is restored, resulting in wellbeing.Healing occurs on four levels –• Core: conscious and subconscious• Genetic: ancestral; DNA• History: including past life• SoulThetaHealing® is essentially a two-step process –• Identify the key beliefs, feelings and traumas that are at the root of theproblems and issues. These may be experiences from this lifetime, includingchildhood, genetic history or previous past lives. All of these have createdsubconscious belief systems and feelings that can still affect the present.ThetaHealing® practitioners are able to identify the subconscious belief systemsand feelings causing the problem by using special techniques; asking questionsand using intuition.• Remove or resolve the belief systems and feelings that are the root cause ofthe issue or problem and replace them with empowering and positive beliefs. Byentering a Theta state, practitioners are able to connect to the energy of theCreator of All That Is and request that deeply held subconscious beliefs,feelings, emotions and trauma are instantly removed and resolved. Theunconditional love of the Source / Creator has the power to heal any illness andto resolve any situation.When we receive a ThetaHealing®, we are also helping those around us and theuniverse, since we are all interconnected at some level. When we heal at agenetic level, we are also healing our ancestors, our relatives, and futuregenerations of our family. Remember, scientists have learned that in quantumphysics, the distinction between the past, present and future does not exist aswe perceive.ThetaHealing® is -• A way to change beliefs that impact the reality we experience.• A way to heal the energy rifts and blockages that occur due to our thoughtsand beliefs.• Transformation that creates physical, psychological/emotional and spiritualhealing.• Aligned with current understanding of quantum physics and quantum mechanicsrelating to how and why thought influences matter.ThetaHealing® facilitates balance and harmony between the conscious andsubconscious minds, while infusing a sense of security and wellbeing.Through the processes of – feeling and belief work – our reality can change andhealing can occur in an instant. It can be permanent and lasting. The USP ofThetaHealing® is that we can identify the belief that is causing the issue, pullit, insert a new one that better serves us and we’re done! As simple as that!What it resolves:ThetaHealing® effectively removes, resolves and clears emotional and physicalissues that hold us back in the journey of life. The subconscious holds secrets,past issues, memories that may be invisible to the conscious mind. One can, withfabulous results, cancel, replace or resolve past or current issues and memoriesand initiate the healing process with ThetaHealing®.Resolve issues -• Deep emotional issues, including trauma from abuse• Physical pain, problems and illnesses• Fears and phobias• Subconscious blocks and obstacles• Bad habits• Negative feelings• Anger management• Grief and bereavement• Stress, anxiety and depression• Past life karma• Soul contracts and agreements• Releasing energetic cords that no longer serve youImprove lifestyle -• Lose weight• Build confidence and self-esteem• Attract a compatible, loving soul-mate• Create wealth and abundance• Overall health and well being• Relationships• Energise and balance ChakrasThere are also some other interesting elements that are a part of this modality,which encompass interesting and meaningful exercises, that deal with –• Manifesting what one truly desires in life, including financial aspects aswell as soul mate or twin flame.• Getting rid of parasites, viruses and bacteria that do not serve any purpose.• Instilling positive feelings that one may never have fully experienced before.• This includes feelings of joy, abundance, respect and honour.• DNA that holds unfavourable cellular memories; scientists used to think ofthis DNA as junk! Changing DNA is part of what enables one to reach one’s fullpotential.• Repairing chromosomes that have been damaged by aging. The telomeres (caps) ofDNA strands fray from aging and can be energetically repaired.• Making the transition for those passing (or who have passed on) from thisplane to another easier.• Traumatic foetal memory.• Broken soul, which for example may happen from chronic and/or severe abuse.• Ending vows and oaths that no longer serve us.• Dark night of the soul• Ending curses and psychic hooks or attacks.• Releasing etheric cords of attachment that no longer serve a person; thisincludes unnecessary ones we have as well as ones others have with us.• Radiation detox• Releasing traumatic free floating memories resulting from an accident orillness (including during anaesthesia), abuse or drunkenness.• Gene replacement or repair of defective genes, including ones involved inaddictions• Soul fragments; retrieving pieces of one’s own as well as returning ones thatwe hold, that belong to another person. Our soul fragments (which are part ofour essence) also hold our power (or that of others if we have soul fragments ofothers stuck in our energy field). One way for these fragments to be transferredis during intense verbal or physical exchanges with another person or group.• Replacing our spirit guides if sometimes we outgrow one of them!• Connecting with our ancestors’ spirits, angels and guardian angels.The Tip:As Dr. Michelle L. Casto sums it up beautifully, “The time is now fortransformation. It is a new era and we are poised with the opportunity to bringin a new consciousness and co-create a new reality. Why? Because the lightwithin each of us has been turned on, and it’s our job to turn that light onbrighter and brighter until all false thought forms dissolve in the light of ourTruth.”“The message that underlies Healing is simple yet radical: we are alreadywhole….. Underneath our fear and worries, there lies a peaceful core which isunaffected by the many layers of our conditioning. The work of healing is,peeling away the barriers of fear that keep us unaware of our true nature oflove, peace and rich interconnection with the web of life. Healing is there-discovery of who we are and who we always have been. Alternative healing doesnot always offer a quick fix of a symptom, but it does offer a permanent healingthat resonates beyond physical well-being.

I wanted to run away from him.Scenario 2: Do you remember that teacher who conducted the meditation the otherday. His presence was so peaceful and overwhelming that I almost wanted to cry.Scenario 3: I visited this resort in the hills of Uttrakhand; it was so peacefuland serene. The moment I entered the place, it was some kind of positive vibesthat took over me. It was a warm feeling as if I have come back home. I felt sogood and healed.Well, I am pretty sure that at some moment in our lives we all have been in theabove 3 similar scenarios. We might have met a person for the first time andinstantly clicked or we might have wanted to run away from that individual andnever want to see him again, some places we visit seems to be inviting and havea warm feeling of belongingness whereas some feel cold and uninviting. Everytime something like this happens, we are actually unconsciously reacting to somekind of invisible energy which we feel and call it casually as the ‘Vibes’ of aperson or a place. We do not know what is it but we know and feel it as a partof our gut feeling.But have you ever wondered what exactly are these ‘VIBES’ that, we casuallyrefer to in our daily conversation?Some might know about it whereas majority of people do not care. But here’s aninteresting fact about them:These invisible vibes are actually energy emanating from everything in thisuniverse, whether visible or invisible. Spiritual people & Healers know thisform of energy as the ‘Aura’. Scientist call the same energy as the ‘Bio fieldor the Electromagnetic field’.It is a measurable field of energy, which not only controls your physical healthbut also plays a major role in your emotional, mental & spiritual well being. Itis now a scientific system of study & research in some of the major institutionsworldwide.Over centuries it has been an intriguing subject of scientific research andspiritual studies. No matter which painting or art form you look at across anytradition around the world, almost every spiritual master or religious deity hasbeen depicted by a halo of light surrounding the head. This was the startingpoint of research for the people who wanted to know and understand what is thebasis of this Halo? Is this something divine & mystical that only a few peoplepossess or something common that is available to everyone?So with this question in mind, scientists started to research and came up withthis interesting fact, which makes absolute sense. As per the theory of Quantumphysics: The whole universe (visible & invisible), is made up of virtually thesame particles of energy. All energy vibrates; some at a faster rate while someat a slower rate; this rate is called the frequency. Now scientifically,frequency is the number of vibrations of a particle per second. The unit ofmeasurement of frequency is Hz (Hertz).So, when we say that the frequency of this object is 10 Hz, it means that theparticular object is vibrating at a speed of 10 vibrations per second. Thatmeans literally everything that you can see or cannot see is energy and isvibrating at various frequencies. You are energy and so I am, even this bookthat you are reading or the so-called ‘empty space’ around you is also energy,which you can’t see but you can surely feel it.Now going back a little to the elementary science we studied in our school time,we know the basic laws of energy like:“Energy can neither be created nor be destroyedbut can only be transformed from one form to another”And the famous equation postulated by Einstein i.e., E=mc2 (where E is Energywhich is equal to M = Mass multiplied by C = speed of light in vacuum), whichmeans that Matter and energy are inter-convertible. Now the famous scientist ofthe last century also said the same thing as the current findings say, thatmatter is just condensed form of energy and what is not visible is simply energyflowing freely all around us.Some of you might be wondering that why am I telling you all this? what is theuse of this piece of information? Hang on with me and you will know why I wantyou to educate yourself about ‘Aura’.The ProcessOur body is made up of atoms and molecules. In each atom we have chargedparticles called electrons, protons and neutrons which when further expanded aremade up of quarks (particles of light) which again on further expansion are madeup of strings and super strings and on further expansion its empty space. Yesnothing else but empty space, so in a way all the matter is originating fromthis empty space of energy, this is called the Nothingness or the zero pointenergy. Now this theory coincides with the spiritual theory that ‘The universecame from nothing and will go back into nothing’. Coincidence, I bet not as itis the real science.The Aura is actually the result of the electrical impulses generated by themovement of electrons and protons around the nucleus in our cells. According tothe famous law of electromagnetic Induction wherever there is an electric field,an equivalent magnetic field would be induced around that electrical field. Forexample: You use a particular screwdriver to open and close electrical circuits,over a period of time it gets magnetized and now has the ability to attractsmall iron fillings. So no wonder, Aura is literally the electromagnetic field.we all know how Doctors use eCg (For measuring Cardiac rhythms) and EEG (Formeasuring Brain signals), uses electrical signals as an input to test the healthlevel of the human heart & brain respectively. Then how can we not believe inthe electro-magnetic field generated by all other organs in the body?Till the time your body is ALIVE & PULSATING, it’s generating a “MEASURABLEBIOFIELD CALLED THE AURA”But here’s the twist now, the Aura is not just limited to your Physical body. Itis much more beyond that and encompasses your mental, emotional, spiritual andastral bodies too. These 4 bodies are called the subtle energetic bodies whichcan be seen only if you train yourself well to operate at a level of energywhich is in sync to their own frequency or perhaps use gadgets like RFI AuraImaging systems or PIP (Poly interference photography).You can imagine our different bodies by taking the example of an onion. On theoutside it looks as one whole but if you remove the covering, you see variouslayers overlapping onto each other and having a common core. Now take thisexample to understand the human energetic system. The inner core here will bethe soul, the various layers will be the different bodies and the outermostcovering will be the aura.So technically Aura is just a medium to hold everything together as one system!The nature of Aura is to reflect what is happening inside the various energeticlayers. So if you are having depressive or negative thoughts about something oryou are having some physical health issue, it will all be reflected as anenergetic imbalance in your aura.The TipReading Aura gives you an edge to know what is really happening at the invisiblelevels of your energetic anatomy. I have experienced it myself in numerous casesthat I was able to predict and map out the imbalances up to 3-6 months inadvance before they actually came into the physical body as DIS-EASES. Being aclairvoyant gives me an edge to see the aura energies and having an engineeringbackground coupled with my extensive research in the field of energy medicineand aura imaging allows me to validate my knowledge with the use of aura imagingsystems. My personal favorite is RFI ™ as it gives you a comprehensive report onwhat is happening at the various levels of your body, mind and chakras. You canuse any or all of the below mentioned methods to check for aura imbalances andthen correct them.• Intuitively through your third eye or sixth sense. (I highly recommend becauseit is powerful & accurate. Combining my research work & experience I have puttogether a whole new step-by-step method of activation of third eye and using itto scan & detect energetic imbalances in the aura & chakras)• Using tools as Dowsing, Lecher Antenna, Universal Scanner, Pendulums etc.• Energetic Scanning via hands as taught in various modalities• Using Aura Imaging systems like Kirlian aura imaging system, Poly InterferencePhotography, energy Field Imaging or using the most updated and reliable systemlike RFI™ (Resonant Field Imaging)Our energetic body is the Key to wellness and is the Core from which thephysical body derives energy. So to maintain the physical health, we mustmaintain a strong and vibrant aura. Once you are able to detect the imbalancesit’s absolutely necessary that you do something to heal it. As the science ofaura says, energetic imbalances in the layers beyond the physical body are mucheasier to heal than the imbalances in the physical body because matter is alsoenergy but at a denser rate of vibration which requires a lot of effort to shiftand heal.Nishant is an IT Engineer by qualification but an Energy Medicine enthusiast bychoice.

Mostly self-inflicted stress, as I had a pattern of wantingto do a good job. This stress resulted in chronic daily migraines, nausea anddebilitating pain in my shoulders and back. I was on shock therapy,physiotherapy and a cocktail of medications to narcotize the pain. I came backto the UK and got used to taking the pain medication, until one day I was at mysisters’ house and she was running her first seminar on EFT (emotional FreedomTechnique). At the same time I also had an intensely painful migraine and mymother persuaded me to try out EFT or “Tapping” to help with the pain. I wasnaturally resistant and reluctant to try anything new, particularly a method ofalternate therapy I knew nothing about. Being a scientist with a PhD from OxfordUniversity, I was a bit skeptical and quite frankly, I thought the technique wasa bit strange. To my surprise, after just 5 minutes of EFT with my mother, myheadache completely vanished. However, my pride got in the way and I told mymother that there was still a mild pain remaining. On the inside, I knew thatsomething had shifted that day and I embarked on my own secret exploration ofEFT studying with 20 of the 26 EFT masters around the world. Using EFT, mymigraines and pain have completely cleared. More importantly, I feel gratefuland have deep reverence for my mother and what she taught me on that day in mysister’s house.“EFT is easy, effective, and produces amazing results. I think it should betaught in elementary school.” Donna Eden, Author, Energy Medicine expertPoor health is related to emotional stress and trauma“Pro-actively clearing daily stresses and past emotional upsets and traumas isthe best health insurance. Once we have health we have everything.”Did you know that 85% of illness is stress induced? Chronic as well asunconscious stress upsets the natural balance of the nervous system, disturbingthe body’s natural ability to maintain and repair itself, making the bodyvulnerable to the effects of poor diet, environmental toxins and microbes. Thisbreakdown of the body’s natural ability may result in disease and illness.A study by Kaiser Permanente involving over 70,000 individuals showed thatchildhood emotional trauma was a significant factor in the development ofchronic disease later in life, specifically:• Alcoholism and alcohol abuse• Depression• Illicit drug use• Risk for intimate partner violence• Smoking• Suicide attempts• Multiple sexual partners• Health-related quality of life issues–Liver disease–Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease–Ischemic heart disease–Sexually transmitted diseasesIn addition, 70 published studies from the community on nearly 70,000 traumasurvivors showed a tenfold increase in depression as well as two studiesfollowing 11,000 people for up to 20 years, revealed an increase in depressionof up to tenfold. Childhood maltreatment has been shown to result in increasedcardiovascular disease in women and depression in both men and women.Emotional hurts and trauma can vary from person to person. For someone, it maybe a parent or teacher saying ‘shut up’ and for others, it could be verbal oreven physical abuse. Trauma is upsetting no matter what the severity.Negative upsets can be experienced at school, home and workplace in the form ofbullying, shouting, angry outbursts, overwhelm and a feeling of being controlledby others. I wonder what hurts you are holding on to? what events have occurredthat have caused you emotional pain? what is it that you get stressed about?Clearing past emotional upsets, hurts and traumas and stress using clinicallyproven techniques like EFT can help.Emotional stress and upsets can be clearedemotional Freedom Techniques, EFT, is now used worldwide by millions and clearsemotional stress and upsets.EFT combines tapping on acupressure points while saying statements out loud.

Once negativity is cleared, it creates a feeling ofwellbeing and calm.The action of tapping on acupressure points while repeating specific phrases outloud releases stress and emotional traumas. The technique integrates ancientwisdom and the science of acupuncture with modern day psychology without theneed for needles. It is one of the few therapies in the world that combines talkand touch.Negative emotions cause a disruption of the body’s energy system. The EFTtapping process re-wires the energy system creating a feeling of peace, calm andletting go. In many cases, after EFT, people experience a shift in thinking thatis more empowering.The Process“EFT is a simple, powerful process that can profoundly influence gene activity,health and behaviour.” Bruce Lipton, Author of The Biology of BeliefEFT is a popular alternative therapy modality that combines tapping onacupressure points on the body with saying specific statements out loud.

A recent reportindicated that those suffering from emotional stress had a much higher chance ofcardiac challenges. The Medical Journal JAMA reports:“Stress can cause a heart attack, sudden cardiac death, heart failure, orarrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) in persons who may not even know they haveheart disease. Individuals with congestive heart failure, coronary heartdisease, known arrhythmias, or other heart or blood vessel diseases should avoidemotional stress whenever possible and learn to manage the effects of stress.”Stress can cause an increase in the stress hormone ‘cortisol’ which can causehavoc with the body’s circulatory, hormonal, immune and digestive systems. Forexample, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a disorder of the digestive system, isnow known to be caused due to stress.The good news is that studies have shown, a regular practice of exercises:breathing, physical exercise, meditations and emotional release can reducecortisol and stress levels resulting in a feeling of calm and well-being. Inparticular, EFT has been clinically shown to reduce stress as well as stresshormones like cortisol. A recent clinical study in war Veterans has shown EFT tobe effective in reducing extreme stress know as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD).EFT points for stress reliefIn the event you suddenly get stressed or overwhelmed with emotions just tapunder the eye, collarbone and under the arm.

Identify the problem by asking yourself• What am I stressed about? What is upsetting me? Who is upsetting me?• How does that make me feel? How does that really make me feel?• Where in the body do I feel this stress or upset? What kind of a sensation isit? How does that make me feel?2. Measure the problem from 1 to 10 by asking• On a scale of 1 to 10, how high is this stress where 10 is a very high stressand 1 is no stress at all?• On a scale of 1 to 10, how high is this emotional upset where 10 is reallyupset and 1 is not upset at all?• On a scale of 1 to 10, how high is this negative feeling where 10 is reallyhigh and 1 is not high at all?3. Start with tapping on the side of the handTap with the fingers of one hand on the karate chop of the other hand(side of the hand below the little finger) and say the following three timeswith feeling:• “Even though I… (Name problem with specific information of what happened, whodid what as well as the negative feeling and number), I deeply and completelyaccept myself.”•For example: “Even though I am really stressed because I have too much work andit makes me feel anxious and it’s a 10/10, I deeply and completely acceptmyself.” 33.png [../images/00029.jpeg] 4. Tap each point 7 times as you say a phrase from the problemRepeat key phrases out loud from the problem, for example the emotion ofspecifics about the problem, while tapping on the points shown below.• Eyebrow – at the beginning of the eyebrow just above the nose• Side of eye – on the bone bordering the outside corner of the eye• Under eye – on the bone just under the eye• Under nose – between the bottom of the nose and the upper lip• Chin – midway between the point of the chin and the middle of the lower lip• Collarbone – at the junction where the breastbone, collarbone and first ribmeet• Under arm – under the arm about 10cm from the armpit• Thumb – on the outside of the thumb, level with the base of the nail• Index finger – on the side of the index finger closest to the thumb, levelwith the base of the nail (miss this point out if pregnant)• Middle finger – in the same place on the middle finger• Little finger – in the same place on the little or baby finger• Karate chop (side of the hand) – on the edge of the hand5. Final clearing. On the Karate Chop say the starting set-up phrase again (namethe original problem again).“Even though I… (Name problem), I deeply and completely accept myself.”6. Relax. Take a gentle breath in and out and take a sip of water. It is veryimportant to drink water to flush out any toxins that get released. 70% of ourbodies are composed of water – drinking water is vital to our health andvitality.7. Testing the results. Measure the problem again from 1 to 10. Notice how theproblem and original emotion feels different. If there is an emotional chargeleft, repeat the tapping process again till you feel better.For more information you can download a free booklet -http://vitalitylivingcollege. [http://vitalitylivingcollege/]info/free-resources/ Matrix Reimprinting – the latest advancement of EFTAlthough EFT is widely available with thousands of testimonials and accolades,most people are not aware of the more advanced forms of EFT, which can allow forinstantaneous healing. Matrix Reimprinting with EFT is an example of a powerfuladvancement of EFT.Matrix Reimprinting combines inner child healing with EFT and quantum physics tore-program the body and mind in conjunction with the spirit. The processculminates in a deep healing heart meditation while simultaneously programmingthe neurological system for health and abundance.The technique literally re-imprints our limiting experiences creating harmony,balance and empowerment. This process is excellent for being at peace with anykind of trauma, powerlessness or helplessness.For example:• Job loss or being put down at work• Relationship break-up or divorce• Accident like fractures, car accidents, injuries• Bullying, made to feel small or weak• Over-worked mom or employee• Coping with loss, grief or sadness• Fighting in the home or at work• Financial worry• Illness, health issue• Physical pain or tension• Verbal, physical or sexual abuseThe beauty of Matrix work is that it makes a connection with the inner child whofelt powerless and helpless and that can also get frozen in time. This innerchild is known as the ECHO in Matrix Re-imprinting. The ECHO becomes the client,enabling the child to claim their power back. It is a very gentle, powerful andpotent technique. 35.png [../images/00030.jpeg] Case studies with EFTDr Rajesh CM heals his back pain completely after attending EFT Training and nowroutinely helps his patients heal from body pain with results in only a singlesitting.“After attending EFT Training with Vitality Living College I became even morepowerful and effective in my private practice.

Instead of pushing EFT onto her son shestarted to use it in front of him on herself and explained to her son, it washelping her to feel calm and relaxed. Her son became curious and allowed his momto use EFT with him. Through EFT they uncovered an incident where the teacherinappropriately insulted her son and they used EFT to vent out all the pent upanger and frustration.

She had a range of different food allergies andwas asked to pick only one allergy to work with. ‘I chose to work with mymushroom allergy and used the process taught during the seminar in the practicesession. After the session, I went home and insisted that my husband take me outto dinner and that too, only to one particular restaurant. I chose the TajPalace, mainly because I’d often seen my husband order the mushroom cappuccinothere. And I had always noticed the look on his face as he told me how Yummy itwas! So, having just gotten rid of my allergy, I now wanted to try it. As we satdown, I told him that I wanted the mushroom cappuccino. My husband did not thinkthat I should try this, especially at night, and attempted to talk me out of it.I disagreed and told him that was what I wanted. Soon, the waiter stepped in andtold us that it was on the house so we should go ahead and try it. We asked himto get one but he added that we could each have one. Yet, my husband, assumingthat I couldn’t have it, told him that one was enough. The soup finally came andit was placed in front of me. The waiter and my husband watched me as I smeltit…. felt okay…. then took a small sip… and still felt okay… then took a deepbreath and finally put a spoonful into my mouth! Hhmmmmm…. It was heaven! Now Iknow what I was missing on while my husband was able to have it all these years…I have now been eating mushroom and fish and all the things I previously hadallergies to. Thank you EFT.

It was a conversation in my head with the source itself and hereit goes!When did I first decide to come to this planet?when your eternal soul got entangled in the web of karma, so entangled that itwas unable to understand how to resolve itself, it needed a mirror. This is whenit was drawn to experience this physical plane.What’s so special about the physical plane?It is the plane of duality. It gives you mirrors. It shows you what you carrywithin through your family, your relationships, your life situations and yourexperience with them. It makes you experience love when you carry love withinand blame when you carry blame within. You cannot escape or run away from selffor wherever you go, your karma follows!But beware, it isn’t a punishment system, it’s a feedback system the voice said.So what’s so special about family?Family is the set of constant mirrors that one manifests which one must face.They show you different aspects of yourself in so many different ways. Through aspouse comes your relationship of love with yourself, through a child comes yourrelationship of nurturing yourself, through a parent comes your relationshipwith accepting your creation and so much more with each of them.So does that mean I must always stay with my family and each member always?Well, each relationship in one’s life is a mirror to some aspect within. Whenone’s relationship with loving one’s self changes, it will also change what isreflected through the mirrors of outside relationships. With every changewithin, each past / every block / every unresolved memory that one has everexperienced in loving one’s self through a friend / family member or through adifficult life situation will be surfaced. The reason isn’t to hinder progressbut rather to facilitate it through the learning one has already imbibed. It’sonly when that learning doesn’t resonate with one’s current awareness or wisdomdo they experience conflicts. When conflicts arise, they bring discomfort in theform of pain, hurt, anger, blame and misery. In that moment one either raiseshis/her wisdom higher by imbibing a new learning or stays with the old patternand resists the change. Depending on how much resistance is imposed, theintensity of pain or suffering will be experienced.Have I chosen my family / my work / my life situations?You have chosen everything my dear, I heard being said. Every situation good orbad, every happiness & misery, every right or wrong, you have chosen everythingthat you are experiencing. Each choice is made by your soul believing theexperience through that choice will give you maximum growth.There are two parts of you, one that you understand as your mind (consciousmind) and one that you understand as your sub-conscious mind. The understandingof the conscious mind is what is in your awareness, weather good or bad; youbelieve it’s you. For example I am strong, I failed, I am rich, I like mangoesetc. The sub-conscious mind however is a projection of that part of you thateither you are unaware of or in non-acceptance of. For example, I feel fear, Ithink I may not succeed, I don’t feel right, I want to become a rich man etc.The sub-conscious carries the soul’s perception of self. If it believes “Moneygets me love”, which comes from a past life where when you loved someone andcouldn’t marry because you didn’t have money, in this lifetime, no matter howmuch money you have, this belief at a deeper level will keep you in theinsecurity of money only to ensure that love is not abandoned or lost. Whatblood is to the body, love is to the soul.Have women chosen to be raped? Have people chosen to die of hunger? Did that guywho was reported to be killed yesterday choose to die?To understand the reasons for why such grave experiences come to soul, you mustunderstand it through an example. Imagine you are a theatre artist and you arechosen for a play. You are ambitious and this seems like an opportunity to proveyour skills. You are called backstage and given a choice of 2 differentcharacters in the play. One of them has to keep standing all through the 3 hrsand deliver a lot of dialogues while the other is also the lead role but he hasto sit on a chair and not say too much. Which one will you choose?Maybe the first one, I said in my head almost instantly.Why? , the voice asked meSince I am ambitious and I want to grow, it makes more sense to choose the rolewhich gives me maximum exposure & hence opportunity to prove my skills and grow.More learning, more growth I said.That’s it. That’s exactly what the soul is doing. Difficult lifetimes offer anopportunity for higher growth. This is what you all believe at a deeper level.So, is this understanding right? Is struggling with life a good thing?No, I wouldn’t say you were created to struggle. This is your own belief systemthat has developed through several experiences spread over eternity. You werecreated to just flow effortlessly. Once things didn’t happen as per what youbelieved was right, you lost trust in the natural flow & started to put effortto have things your way. When you did get things and attributed it to thestruggle you did and there began a vicious cycle. Had you just trusted the flowand when things didn’t seem right, would have trusted a bigger pictureunfolding, life would have been effortless. Struggle is a choice your soulsmade.Does that mean we should stop doing any action?No, effortlessness isn’t to be confused with non-action. Action done being achannel of the universe doesn’t seem like effort. When your input is requiredsomewhere, the opportunity is presented in the most effortless way and doing therespective action almost happens without you feeling like a doer. Since youdidn’t plan or intend for the action, there are no expectations from the resultand the highest order prevails. This sort of action brings your unconditionalinput to the universe.Does that mean if I go out of my way to help someone, it isn’t really required?The way you are a spark of the creator, so is everyone. If someone’s journeywill need your contribution, it will come your way in a time & place where youwill be able to make that contribution in the most effortless way. Everythingwill fall into place giving you a feeling as if there was a plan. While if youare thinking about someone, worrying over their circumstances or pitying them,then realize that in those moments, you are forgetting that they are sparks ofthe same creator too. If they need help, they will be able to attract it fromthe universe. Your concern for them is again mirroring some weakness /insecurity about yourself through them. For example, what if I become like them,what if I lose all my money like them, maybe he is feeling very lonely etc.These are all emotions that bother you or raise your own fears which are why youattracted them in their lives. It’s a way to show you how you are not present tonegativities within yourself. That is the real reason for their presence in yourlife.As long as you are accepting the spark of love that you are, without any effort,you will be able to help so many others in realizing their own inherent power.You will move & inspire them. That is what will bring real growth to thisuniverse.So what to do when we feel like a victim? When we experience pain and misery?• Bring awareness to self. The moment we drop any outward action i.e. the blame,the pity, the anger and realize we are attracting it, it initiates the processof that energy dissolving itself.• Bring complete acceptance of your reality. We usually only accept partialrealities, because it’s difficult to face our mistakes, our guilt.Non-acceptance of this reality only prolongs the process of resolving the rootcause of the misery. Forgive yourself consciously for your contribution or lackof it to the situation and accept everything unreasonably.• Stop justifying your truth at the cost of others. Stop telling yourself butwhat happened was really wrong, or what so and so did was wrong, or what so andso happened is why all of it happened. Realize you ATTRACTED all of that youcall wrong because at some level you only lack understanding of that aspectwhich is in conflict. By justifying the existence of this conflict, you willonly energize it.• Empower yourself by knowing you created this pain, this blame, this anger andit has arisen out of a conflict within. If you are its creator, you can destroyit too.• Create intent to learn the lesson that misery brings through that conflict inthe highest and best way.• Heal the reason for why the conflict exists by taking guidance from thecreator. As long as you stay focused inwardly, you can heal it at the deepestlevel and resolve it forever.• The healing part of this is done through the beautiful modality of “SerenitySurrender” or SS, which I have talked about later. This sort of healing will dotwo things. It will resolve that conflict at the soul level forever hencestopping itself to attract it again and it will expand the conscious awarenessof your soul so that it does not create further karma based on the conflictedunderstanding.Do our relationships last forever?Yes they do but not necessarily in the way we perceive them. They transform,they evolve as we evolve. If A and B were married 20 years ago, they have servedeach other as a mirror for that time. When their relationship would have begun,in most cases, they would have started by seeing the love that they carry forthemselves through the other and hence experienced love for them. When love isexperienced by a soul, it will also surface its lack of understanding of love,the rejection it felt through love, the betrayal it felt through love, thesuffering that love brought and the unforgiveness for self above all. All ofthis will allow the distortions of love to be dissolved and hence a deeperunderstanding of love shall emerge. All of this comes up not to bother one butto free one’s perceptive experience of love from anything that isn’t the highestunderstanding of it. Now if A’s soul believes love is betrayal andunforgiveness, it will manifest / attract it through a life situation /relationship / person. It won’t be easy to face and accept the betrayal as one’sown choice. There will be a need to disown it, to blame, to justify it was nevermy fault but all of this will never even begin the healing process because onewill be defying the basic principal of the ‘law of attraction’ which works allthe time that we are the soul magnets and we attract everything BUT from thesub-conscious level. We may or may not carry, a memory of our deserving ofsomething we detest now and yet, it’s there, deep within.If A is able to stay focused inwardly, he/she will be able to heal his/herrelationship with B, because B was only a mirror to what A carried within. BUT,their relationship will also transcend to a new level now. If B is able to makethe same journey inwardly and both meet at a point of self-love and compassion,they will stay in compassion and in a mutually agreeable relationship forever.However if A makes it and B doesn’t, then A will be facilitated out of thesituation and in spite of B’s need to hold-on to A, the universe will resolve itfor the one who is able to forgive oneself.It’s also possible that B was always there, it is just A who couldn’t see it. Inwhich case, they will meet where they will share mutual love & growth.In either case, the relationship MUST go through a transformation because onelearns deeper about loving one’s self as we move forward. What A could seethrough B, 20 yrs. back, was what A could understand about loving self then. In20 yrs. both have learnt deeper about loving themselves and hence what they seethrough each other is only a deeper understanding of loving self. If therelationship seems less loving or sour now, it only means at a deeper level,they have not been able to establish a higher understanding of love for selfthrough each other. The deeper you go, the more intense it gets and hence thegravest mistakes / lacks that the souls believe as a part of them will alsosurface. This only facilitates further depth to self-realization.The need of A to hold-on to B or B to hold-on to A...the need for A to stick tothe relationship 20 yrs. back or B for the same is only non-acceptance ofthemselves in this present moment. It is bound to give misery.Love never meant possessing or holding-on. Love only meant allowing self and theother to be. It also means if the one you love has a role to play in yourjourney and you have in theirs, it will be facilitated lovingly so. If not,realize that you are only limiting your experience of love within. Realize whenyou are being guided to rise above your fears and find yourself through othermeans. Love isn’t and cannot be forced. If one loves self, they will experiencelove from everyone around naturally and effortlessly so.What is fear?Fear is the need to believe in the presence of an outcome in the future of asituation / relationship or behavior, which will bring misery. Fear itself meansthat you are energizing that outcome which didn’t even exist before the feararose. It could be coming from some unresolved past in which this situationexpected to come in the future did arise and gave misery & hence the beliefsystem from then onwards, believes in the respective outcome & the misery taggedalong with it.From the soul’s perspective, the fear arose because it wanted to go. You,instead of realizing that it wants to go, started believing in it. It then getsheavier & more energized and settles down back again. It slowly grows big enoughto be mirrored through your physical reality or what you feared will happen. Youthen justify that you knew it was going to happen and that’s why you feared it,but that isn’t true. You feared it & chose fear over faith, which is why itbecame a part of your reality because it was made to believe it’s significantenough by none other than yourself.What do we need to do when we fear?Stay with faith & heal the fear. Follow the 6 steps I gave you (written above).Do them and then you will be ready to heal that fear. It will dissolve forever.If done pro-actively, on the first sign of the fear, many grave life situationscan be avoided. Remember, the soul was never meant to suffer. Suffering is achoice it makes; only when it doesn’t believe in its ability to resolve itsconflicts otherwise.Finally...Finally, if you want the mirror to show you differently, the only way is tochange yourself within. Life is about moving forward only and in complete trustthat whatever is needed for your growth, will flow to you, effortlessly so.Holding-on to any person / relationship or life situation only brings misery.Letting go in compassion, trust and surrender expands the love we carry withinand our experience of love too.Forgiveness for self and others is the key. Life is an experience. It grows andchanges mirrors. Accept change. Accept the flow.This conversation was elaborate & profound. This was just after I found myconnection with the source through “Serenity Surrender” or SS. I didn’t evenknow my potential to receive such profound knowledge.Serenity Surrender (SS), I realized is the most amazing way to connect with thedivinity in each of us. It has been brought to this planet by Shivi Dua, who isan inspiration for all those who get touched by her. She started her journey ofhealing out of her need to be able to help her daughter who was diagnosed withasthma at the age of 3. Starting with Reiki in year 2000, as she progressedinwardly through healing herself & others, she found her connection with thecreator. Through this connection, she was revealed deep knowledge about hersoul’s journey & life. She started using this knowledge via her healings to helpothers and in year 2010, she was guided to pass on this knowledge to others on ajourney to realize self. The name itself suggests arriving at serenity withinthrough practicing surrender. SS has been helping many souls to grow in theirunderstanding of self empowerment by the way of transforming themselves at boththe conscious & sub-conscious level ever since.Here is an excerpt from Shivi’s book “Let the power be with you” that publishedin Speaking Tree, Times of India in Oct 2009.“Everything that we think about receives energy through our thought. When weaccept our power, we also learn to send our power packets to the all that giveus happiness. We stop sending them to those that upset us because we don’t wantto energize them and increase their role in our lives.At times, when we are praying, we might be asking the Creator to help us forgivethose who have done us wrong, while at other times; we might be busy condemningthe person for doing the same. Brooding over the past in this manner will giverise to anger and possibly, revenge. In our ignorance, we are sending our powerpackets to the wrong that we experienced, the person we believe wronged us andto the emotions of anger and revenge. These will then easily negate those wesent during our prayer for forgiveness. Later, we might even find it convenientto blame the Creator for not answering our prayers.Accepting the past and whatever unpleasant may have taken place helps us tointegrate it in us. Reminding ourselves that the other person in question isentitled to his own way of looking at things; handling his life helps us acceptwhatever happened between him and us in a neutral manner and in moving on. Onlythen we can continue to create positive vibrations to ‘forgive and forget’though it really should be ‘accept and forgive’. Accept them as they are andforgiveness follows naturally. Trying to forget only makes us remember it againsome other time. Accepting it actually frees us of the burden.It was about four months since we had moved to Chandigarh, when one morning onher way to school, the bus my daughter was travelling in met with an accident. Atruck hit the bus and a windowpane broke and fell on my daughter’s hands,leaving her with cuts and scratches. While narrating the incident, she also toldme that all the children in the bus were concerned about her. She said despitethe blood and the pain, she felt good. She recollected earlier incidents inother places we moved to where it was through some sort of suffering that shemade friends in the new place. She finally said: “I knew something like thiswill happen and I will make friends here also.” Needless to say, I pointed outto her that it was this belief of hers that was creating this misery for hertime and again and that she deserved to make friends wherever she went easilyand effortlessly ... All you have to do is to believe in your power to createyour life afresh and send the right power packets out to the Universe.”This book is now an integral part of the Serenity Surrender healing modality. Itis a beautiful and simple way to understand how to live a life of awareness &feel empowered each moment.SS is a channel by the way of which it becomes possible for each to see theirlife, situations, relationships & concerns from a higher perspective. When welook at our lives from the limited understanding of our physical reality, wetend to blame, get angry or feel victimized. This is because in that moment,what we can see, hear & feel from the physical life situation & people, takesprominence. We fail to see how we have attracted the respective relationship orsituation. Over our journey right from the creation of the soul, we have judgedourselves, punished ourselves and believed in experiencing evolution throughstruggle & misery. All of this happened because from the moment of our creationas a soul, we have perceived ourselves as other than the creator. We developedan identity, which was other than what we implicitly were. This need foridentity gave us the need to attract various experiences, by the way of which wesought who we are. Having chased who we are, we many times identified ourselvesas different people in different roles and each role we played at each stage,only brought us closer to believing that we are bigger than that role. Wheneverwe got stuck in the role than looking at ourselves as the one who’s playing it,we got trapped in it till we realized our power over that role, the power ofhaving chosen it.SS happened to me at a time when I needed these answers. I guess I attracted itand it was the universe’s way of telling me that I am guided & supported in somany ways. I say it happened to me because I look at it as a phenomenon, whichtransformed my being deep down to the cell level. As we transform ourunderstanding of self, by the way of healing the SS way, we eventually bring achange in our DNA, thus defying any rules of horoscope; destiny or genetics thatwere meant to imply on us and give us a certain way of life.All of us have desires we would like to manifest. All of us also haveundesirable situations, which we’d rather do without. Whatever we desire & oursoul desires it too, we have it in this moment. Whatever we don’t have in thismoment & yet we desire it, simply conveys that we have reasons within oursub-conscious for why we can’t have it. It could be a fear of losing somethingelse or a lack of understanding growth through it or simple lack of deserving.The way the conscious mind can carry unresolved experiences which were 20 yearsback, the sub-conscious can go back 20,000 years. Today, what we experience asourselves, internally / within or externally through relationships, money, work,responses, society etc., all of it is the cumulative understanding of who we areas per our combined consciousness. The sub-conscious carries memories andlearning from past lives too, which it has held on for further learning.We need to be able to know what’s in store with my sub-conscious mind and learnwhat is due to feel whole & complete in this moment. Else, that unresolved pastthat hasn’t “passed”, interferes and distorts our present. This is what SerenitySurrender gave me…the ability to know what it is that I am still holding on. Ittaught me how to overcome hurdles experienced by my soul.To understand how SS works, I will explain how it contributes to one’s journey.This will make it simpler and inspire those who have at the soul level alreadychosen it as a path of self-discovery.The conceptual base for growing through SS is that we all are a spark of theCreator, of pure unconditional love. As we start to understand our journey bytraversing backwards from now, everything that we are other than pureunconditional love is only a perception of who we are rather than what we reallyare.When in this moment, we are faced with a difficult life situation orrelationship or person, it means that we have encountered a deep energetic blockin the understanding of self at the sub-conscious level. Imagine a ball oflight, which is throwing its light to the surroundings. Suddenly, within theball, there is a block / obstruction to the spread of light. Something like adark patch is created inside the ball. The flow of light through it seemed toget blocked. Wouldn’t the projected area, wherever externally it was throwingits light, seem to create darkness now? Isn’t absence of light only what we knowas darkness? Yes indeed it is. That ball of light is us while that distortion inour flow of light is projected as a difficult situation / person or relationshipin our life. While this happens, also notice that within the ball, all the lightis now falling on the dark patch. If that process is allowed and we startrecognizing the power of the light that we are, we can focus on the reason thedark patch exists, heal that energetic blockage and restore the flow of light.To heal an energetic blockage coming from sub-conscious beliefs, here are a fewthings that need to be understood first. Let me share a few examples of suchblockages and what was revealed during SS Healing Sessions to help my clientsovercome their concerns. This will allow a deeper understanding of the modality.Case Study 1• Symptoms / ConcernClient was a woman named Radhika (name changed), 35 years old, healthy, married& had 2 kids. Her concern was double edged. One was that she since the last 2years was having a relationship with another man (name given is Shekhar) outsideher marriage. That guy was also married and had a happy family. Both of themfelt very connected at a deeper level. She felt she was cheating her husband byholding on to this guy but she couldn’t let him go either. She justified herstand by telling me that her husband (name given is John) had a relationshipwith a colleague a few years ago and ever since that was revealed, although sheforgave him, but something between them had changed. Her second concern was thelack of love & passion between her & her husband. Through this emotional &mental tug of war, she was also feeling confused, torn & lost. She neededguidance to what was the right thing for her to do.Now as these kinds of cases come in, the first thing that I intend to makepeople understand is that something of this intensity, could potentially have alot of past associated with it. The depth of the problem can tell you the depthof unresolved memories or understanding at the soul or sub-conscious level. Itis a journey & although the changes at the sub-conscious level happen instantly,in some cases it might take 3-4 sessions also to see the affects in the physicalreality. In one’s thoughts & emotions though, mostly instant changes arereported.• Therapy -In the first SS Session, I connected with the Creator & asked for her karmiclinks from her past with Shekhar. A past life of hers was revealed where she isa young lady in her early twenties. She was wearing some ethnic dressing of someAsian civilization. Shekhar is a man who’s with her. Both of them must be intheir mid twenties. They seem to be very scared and it seemed as if it’s eveningtime, and they are hiding in a quite lonely place. As I progressed in the story,I saw that a few people who seemed to belong to the lady’s tribe / villagemanage to find them & drag the guy with them. The woman was screaming & shoutingbut they didn’t listen. She follows them to a place where there are more peopleof the same village / tribe. They are angry that she had chosen to run away witha guy from a different / rather enemy tribe and hence they were looking forthem. They eventually kill him and she then commits suicide after him, in grief& unforgiveness for self.This lifetime indicated that she carried extreme guilt for Shekhar’s death, forbeing responsible for his loss of life because of her tribe, intense need to bewith him while strong fear that the society (tribe in that life) won’t allow itto happen. In this life hence she had manifested him in a position where all ofthese beliefs of the soul manifested and since they are in a relationship otherthan marriage, she fears she will never be able to be with him in a legitimaterelationship.Using SS, I healed this past life in her sub-conscious, which meant I made hersub-conscious see that past life from a higher perspective. Through doing thather grief, sorrow & guilt for Shekhar’s death dissolved and her soul understoodthat the adverse situation that both of them faced with each other was onlymeant to be that way since they chose it to see their fears of being with eachother & society and be able to rise above them.While I was experiencing her past life, she felt slight pain in her chest area,which also went away as I healed the life. The pain was a sign of her grief andsadness upon Shekhar’s death, which she experienced in her emotions and hencebody at that time.She felt lighter after the session and her anxiety over her relationship withShekhar reduced from a scale of 9/10 to 7/10.Slowly, in a few more sessions, we went beyond this past life to trace theirjourney together. It’s not only past lives having unresolved karma but sometimeswe carry deep karmic roots from beyond earth times also. The soul has livedeternally and possibly many of us have lived before earth too, in other planes.I realized that even before she came to the earth, she had distorted herunderstanding of the masculine aspect and hence had experienced pain orsuffering through her masculine counterparts. I worked through these beliefs inher sub-conscious to bring a conceptual understanding of what her masculineenergy means to her and how only suffering through it was not the only one.It emerged as a pattern that Shekhar and Radhika couldn’t be happily together inseveral lifetimes. In one lifetime, both she and Shekhar were friends. They wereboth men. They were young. They used to steal things and rob people in thattime. They did it more for fun, than any limitations. One day, they planned torob a house. As they entered, the owner was a very beautiful young lady andthere was a 2-3 years young baby playing there. Radhika (a man in that life) wasextremely drawn towards the mother of the baby. He found her extremelyattractive. Shekhar resisted but Radhika made a move towards the young lady.Since they were robbers and were armed, she got defensive and ran. It didn’tseem like either of them meant any harm to her but she got more scared thanexpected, maybe due to her own fears. She instantly ran towards the stairs andin the anxiety fell off the stairs and died. All of it was very instant and whathappened made Radhika extremely shameful for that child & the young lady. Hedidn’t mean to take things to that level but he couldn’t ignore the fact thatthe young boy had lost his mother.That young baby is John (her husband) in her current life. When I revealed thislife to her, she shared that indeed her sexual relationship with her husbandisn’t good. She felt as if she’s punishing herself by sleeping with him. Shealso recalled that she had an extremely volatile relationship with his motherand she unnecessarily blamed her to have separated her from her son. The dotsstarted connecting.From this recent lifetime, her soul was carrying extreme guilt & sense ofresponsibility for John and the need to provide for him & care for him for alifetime because she carried the shame for having deprived him of his mother &shelter. Then she mentioned that for many years her husband didn’t earn well andshe used to work and take care of the entire family. This was another validationthat she was indeed carrying this past.When I asked her about Shekhar’s stand on her marriage, she says he believes myhusband is a nice man and I must stay with him & care for him. That alsoreflected that somewhere deep inside, their souls were in acceptance that theycan’t be together and yet the unresolved karma with each other drew them closerto each other too.As we resolved more & more of her past, her belief system at the sub- consciouslevel altered. The way we do what we believe in our mind, our life is created bywhat our soul believes in to be its reality. As the belief system of the soul isaltered, its need for misery, suffering, pain and failure can also be resolvedand one can move forward & evolve only through love.She noticed that her emotions for Shekhar were changing. He anyways was lessinvolved with her than the way she was. He was clear that his family is apriority to him. She started feeling greater acceptance for her husband. Shecomplained that he never expressed his love for her, which started to change.They started spending more time together and discussing their differences. Shethen did the 3 Day SS Basic workshop with me to learn more about her souljourney and to learn to heal her own sub-conscious. She also wanted to heal herhusband out of his concerns so that both of them could mutually grow together.Today she leads a happy life. I believe Shekhar & Radhika are still friends butshe got over the intense desire to spend her life with him & is now inacceptance of her current reality.She particularly mentioned that her way of looking at life had changed post theworkshop & now when she saw someone better or worse than her, she didn’t judgethem or herself and still feel love & compassion for them. How beautiful doesthat sound?I particularly chose this case study, not because I want to say when you aremarried then staying in the marriage is the only way to be. Had my client’s soulbeen with John only to see through her karma with him & there was no furtherscope of mutual growth, these healings could have also facilitated them to partways effortlessly, without having to blame or fight with each other.Healing through SS facilitates the soul to move forward in the direction that isthe best for the soul in question, without having to deal with suffering on theway.Case Study 2• Concern / SymptomsBella (name changed) had Auto-Immune Disorder when she came to me. She wasalready on allopathic medication & treatment and she had been also helped by aholistic healer friend to overcome her fear of death. When she came to me, herprimary two concerns wereThe symptoms of the disease were there and she obviously wanted to overcome herdisorderShe had lost her hair due to the disease. She had developed this whole complexabout her looks because of the loss of hair. This troubled her even more thanher disease. She had stopped working and stopped facing people completely onlybecause she feared what will they think of her when they see her without herhair. The doctors said she will slowly grow her hair but she couldn’t trustthem. Something inside told her as if she was meant to lose that hair.She had an old friend whom she liked and they were planning to take theirrelationship forward. The guy lived in another country and was due to arrive in5 weeks. She was very anxious as to what will he think of her when he sees herminus the hair. This guy had been very supportive of her emotionally throughouther treatment and she knew he wouldn’t logically feel anything of the sort buther fear wouldn’t let her believe this.• Therapy –I first discussed Bella’s opinion on self & beauty. I realized she had a lot ofjudgment about her looks and thought she was a tall, young good looking & fitwoman to look at, she carried too much insecurity. She would diet, she wouldexercise like a freak, she would weigh herself every day and she would make surewhen she stepped out of the house; she was looking perfect each time.It isn’t a bad thing to take care of one’s body but when we are too focused onthe body, somewhere we may also be using it to stay in aversion of the soul.One’s beauty is a projection of how they feel within.As I connected with her energies and then the creator, I was guided to a pastlife of hers. This time the guidance was more feelings & thoughts based.I saw her as a young lady who has a slightly dark complexion. She is smart,confident and happy. She meets a guy whom she is attracted to. The guy doesn’tgive any indications of the kind but he’s nice to her. In her heart she fallsfor him. They are good friends and they share a lot of their life with eachother. Once, while Bella crosses his room, she hears him talking to anotherwoman who’s also his friend. It seemed like the other woman confronted about hisemotions for Bella and he says something to the effect that “She’s a good friendbut I don’t love her. She’s a little dark & ugly for what I want as mycompanion”. Bella overheard this conversation and her heartbreaks. She cries andcries for days, looking at herself in the mirror. She is unable to get over thefact that he called her ugly.She lost all her confidence then and pretty much spends her life alone. She isnever able to bring her to the understanding that she is worthy of love. Shestarts to believe her life and her ugliness is a punishment she must endure.She marries a much older guy upon the suggestion of her parents who are old andwant her to just get married before they die. She doesn’t care about whom she’smarrying and after marriage, even the old man makes her realize that she isn’tgood looking enough. She further falls into depression and pretty much wastesaway her life in the grief.While dying through a disease in that life, she realizes that she pretty muchwasted her life and got into a self-destructive pattern. This was exactly whatshe was doing now. Autoimmune disorder at the sub-conscious level means the soulis in a self-destructive trap. It’s destroying itself and only through thatdestruction does it believe it can move forward. This is what her soul did whenshe destroyed her dreams, her life only to believe she could have move forwardonly this way. This guy in this past life was the guy she liked in the currentlife so she also carried a fear of being rejected by him on account of herlooks.I healed this past life of hers for her judgment of her looks, her need tobelieve that only if she is good looking can she get love and her need todestroy self. She also carried the fear of rejection from her friend.Soon after, I directly asked for her specific concern of her hair. Why did sheattract the hair-loss and how will she start growing them again.There was another past life. This time it was just one scene in which Bella wasa boy who promised her deity whom she worshipped in a past life that when shewill get something she desired, she would get her head shaven. However shedidn’t keep that promise then. Now in this life, she feels that losing her hairis the only way to punish herself so that her desires will start gettingfulfilled again or so that “god” will start listening to her. So her sub-conscious believes losing the hair is the only way to move forward.I healed her guilt and shame for breaking her promise to her deity. Her sub-conscious was given a higher perspective of her evolution & the role her bodyplays in it.We healed 5-6 times over gaps of a week each between two sessions. When herfriend came in 5 weeks, he was completely supportive of her and stood by her.Her hair had started growing and in-spite of her medical reports marginallychanging, her body symptoms like headaches, feeling lost, lack of confidence,hot flushes etc. vanished. She even joined office in 3 months time.These were 2 case studies, just to give an idea of all that goes on within oursub-conscious and what can be done to resolve it.Serenity Surrender (SS) is a revolutionary methodology to be able to not onlyknow & understand our soul’s eternal journey but to bring it to learn itslessons faster & free this moment of suffering. A believer or a non- believer isonly a choice but by virtue of being in a human existence, and yet, we all gothrough conflicts between our conscious & sub-conscious, we all haveun-fulfilled desires or fear of losing what we have, we all have attachments &dependencies and we all wish to move forward to a state of peace & joy.The typical concerns that can be resolved using SS are in the areas of:• Relationship Concerns• Fear & Phobias• Blocks in growth / work / money• Physical Ailments of any kind• Depression• Anxiety & Stress• Marriage Related Concerns• Lawsuits / Manifested Fights / Conflicts• Getting rid of external negative energies• Finding a soul mate• Deeper into self (spiritual journey)There are two ways of seeking help using SS.You can opt for private sessions. SS is a New Age modality specificallychanneled for souls who have chosen to expedite their journey and face self at adeeper level. A typical SS session lasts anywhere between 1-1.5 hrs. SS is afairly simple & extremely effective technique that does NOT involve hypnosis ofany kind.You can attend the 3 Day SS Basic workshop. The SS Basic workshop enables one tolearn the SS way of healing for self & others. Post the 3-day workshop, you willbe able to experience and heal your own past, including past lives.The SS workshop is a transformatory experience and one attracts it only whenthey are ready for their life’s perspective to completely change & align itselfto their highest best. The 3 day session includes theoretical understanding of asoul’s journey, how creation ever began, how we perceived ourselves to becomewho we are today, how the conscious & sub-conscious operate & communicate,karma, past lives, how our past impacts our present, what do relationships meanto the soul, concepts like marriage & money, how to receive guidance from thecreator (pure unconditional love) and how to heal past life karmic memories toinstantly transform in this moment.It also includes practical healing sessions done in pairs, for self & grouphealings provided to all participants by the trainer. Ideally everyone gets whathe or she comes for and more from the workshop. They go back home feelingempowered having found their divine connection through which they can instantlyshift their negative thoughts, emotions & relationships and change their life ona daily basis. It makes them more complete within & they are able to freethemselves of everything which isn’t helping them in being happy & blissful now.The process enhances a deeper connection with self. Let’s endeavor to become thelimitless pool of love that is hidden within our perception of ourselves.Minal Arora is an IT Geek transformed into a spiritual healer & mentor.

As I waited for him in the café, I gazed out of the bigglass window from which I could see a vast expanse of woods. The sight of thewoods, in autumn, was heavenly. I have been to these woods many times, as thisis my favorite dog-walking route. I looked at the people around me in the café –some, who like me, were there accompanying a patient, some who probably workedin the hospital, and some would have been patients, waiting for theirappointment. Like me, some were admiring the view outside, some were justengaged in their own thoughts and some (presumably staff) were busy discussingtheir work. I wondered how many of these people have ever walked in woods justto get out of their daily routine.Do they know how deep these woods are? Have they ever paused to observe thebeautiful trees, flowers or the birds, which come every season? I was notjudging them; rather the question was to me too. Why, after having lived therefor nearly eight years, I never visited the woods? why did I start going out inwoods almost every day since last 2 years only? I love fitness and have beengoing to a gym regularly since a long time. And then I bought a puppy. I neededto take her out for walks. At first it was a chore for me as I never saw howwalking in nature would be fun. Looking back, the root for this belief emanatesfrom my own belief system as growing up; I was not used to see women of my agetaking their dogs out for a walk. After sometime, I started enjoying my chore.Once I became aware of the trees, the greenery, the birds, the nature, it nolonger remained a chore. So what changed; my awareness of the surrounding or1 Special thanks to my friend and colleague JP Sears for this term, which Igratefully acknowledge. my spiritual awareness? Once that changed, I startedenjoying my walks; rather looked forward to it. Every day was a new revelation –the trees, the woods, the greenery tells you so many things. I started learningso many things and till date I am learning something new each day.The walls around usSitting in the café, I realized the walls that I had built around me – the wallsthat had to be dismantled for me to realize the mere presence of woods near me.As human being, we build walls around us to make us feel ‘safe’ and ‘secure’.The walls provide us comfort that nothing will change around us, that there willnot be any new challenge to face that my environment will continue to remain thesame.In the past couple of years, I have worked extensively on myself and with myclients on various issues that confront us. Each of us is unique. We facechallenges or environment that may be similar, yet everyone deals with ituniquely. I will demonstrate this using my own example. Being the youngest offour siblings, I was born – and grew up – in the shadows of my siblings. Perhapsthe very first experience learnt was to get myself noticed among the siblings. Iwas friendly little girl, talkative and easy-to-get-along-with. However, inschool or among relatives I always found myself being compared with my ownsiblings or a cousin or a friend – (unfortunately) someone who was smarter thanme. It was a constant pressure to perform, to prove myself better than theothers, to excel and to keep raising the bar higher. I was not up to thischallenge. I found an ‘easier’ way out. I self-accepted that I am a mediocre andthat nothing is great about me. So rather than matching the (ever-rising)expectations of people around me, I learnt the best way to deal with this was tobelieve that I was ‘non-special’. This belief served me well and made me feelsafe and secure.A few years back, I had a client who used to harm herself. She was in arelationship with a married person and had drugs related issues. Working withher, I gathered that her parents had migrated to the USA from India. As withfirst generation immigrants, the parents worked very hard to provide good livingconditions to their kids. At same time they wanted to ensure that the kids carryall the values (read belief system) from the culture that they have immigratedfrom. As someone who has made a change from one environment to another, I do notwant to let-go of my belief system, and at the same time ‘enforce’ it on peoplearound me. As a child, adhering to two-belief system (one abstract, which is‘loosely’ followed within the confines of my home; the other, more defined, towhich I am exposed to most of my conscious life) is a difficult task. So long asa child is dependent on parents they do things to ‘please’ their parents, butdeep inside, they do not feel connected to those acts. As humans, we are born toexpress ourselves. When this opportunity is denied to us – either due tocircumstances or environment - we are unable to contain this need (to express)within ourselves and, in some cases, start abusing ourselves. The root of myclient’s abuse lay in her desire to be heard, to be recognized as a person andto feel worthy in her own eyes.The walls around us are everywhere. They are expressed in our common parlance:• “I can never lose weight, I am fat.”• “I am not beautiful.”• “I am not worthy.”• “I will never be rich.”• “I am not talented.”• “I am never heard.”• “I may not speak.”These are just some examples. There are many such ‘walls’ that are deeplyembedded within us. We build them, and with each adverse event, the walls getstrengthened, and finally we believe them to be true!Self-SabotageAs a child, we experience events that lead us to firm beliefs (walls). Somebeliefs are inherited – the parents pass them to their children; some are basedon the societal norms (do’s and don’ts), and some are even related to past-lifeexperiences. The belief system that we are born with (past-life experience),coupled with those we have inherited and those we are expected to ‘conform to’sometimes inhibits our need to express differently. We are expected to be‘polite’ to people who may have harmed us; we are expected to ‘pay attention’ tosomeone who we find boring… and the list goes on. Our inability to conforminstills ‘shame’ in us. We are shamed for non-conformity; we feel shameful forbeing what we are. And the shame in us, results in self-sabotage.So what is shame and how does it affect our self-belief and feeds self-sabotage?As a coach, I come face-to-face with shame with almost all my clients. Once Irealized the impact of shame on my clients, I took time to study it deeply.Another client, in her 20’s, came to me complaining of some physical issues. Shesuffered from severe lower back pains, had irritating skin and was indepression. After my first consultation I could sense that the root of herproblems lay somewhere else. I started working with her nutrition and exercise,knowing fully well that she was suffering from some type of shame. As a Coachyou don’t want to confront her – you need to gain your client’s confidencebefore you start. It is you – as a coach – who needs to listen, not the otherway round!As a child (aged 9) she was in love with a boy. When this came to the knowledgeof her parents, she was severely punished and deported to stay with a relative,far away from her home. This led my client to ‘believe’ that she is not loved,not worthy of being loved and that being in love is not good. She felt betrayedby her parents. It was ‘shameful’ being a kind of girl none can be proud of.This shame in her led her to believe further that she was not worthy of anythinggood happening in her life, and if someone is being good to her, then the personhas some ulterior motive. As a result of her belief, my client lost trust inpeople. The pain in her lower back was the manifestation of an event when shewas sexually abused while being ‘deported’.In ‘shame’ my client tried her very best to please her parents, to make themlove her. When she failed, she tried ‘self abuse’. She learnt the hard way thatshe can ‘control’ her parents by harming herself! when I met her she was in her20’s with some physical issues, her low back pain was severe, some skin disorderand deeply in depression. She had an inner child of 8 year old. She was fearfulof outer world and it was difficult for her to trust any man – even her husband.When I asked her to write down everything she believed in, below is what shecame back with:“I am not worthy enough to be loved.”“My parents are perfect people, I betrayed them.”“All men are dishonest.”“I will die one day in depression.”“I believe art is the best form of presentation.”It took my client a good few months to come up with her beliefs. To me, it wasthe first break-through. My next line of work was how to make her being lovedagain. When I asked her this question, she laughed for good few minutes and saidit was impossible. Her belief that she is not loved was so deeply rooted in herthat she was fearful to address it and move to a strange zone which was notfamiliar to her. The shame in her was giving her comfort.“You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe,deserve your love and affection.” - BuddhaI asked my client to answer some questions honestly. They were:1. What are your beliefs about people?2. Why do you fear people?3. What is the worst thing that can happen when meeting people?4. Are my beliefs in this area improving the quality of my life?For someone, who is stuck in similar situation, it helps to realize whethertheir beliefs are helping them move in their journey. Once they realize that thebelief is not serving them, they let it go.In her beliefs, my client had written something that caught my eye: “I believeArt is the best form of presentation”. I was curious what she means. Like me,she loved to draw. I introduce her to Mandala making and every week, I’d ask herto make a new Mandala for me. Her Mandala started speaking in depth of what herself- sabotage belief was. Mandala also helped her relax. There was a noticeabledifference in the way she walked and breathed. Her shoulder muscles startrelaxing - a tight shoulder is indication of holding anger and closeness of yourheart chakra.Healing is a slow process. Getting rid of your beliefs – some that you have beencarrying for a very, very long time – is not easy. Your beliefs – good or bad –give a meaning to your life, your actions and your thoughts. Getting rid of themis like ‘reset’ button on your life. As a coach, my aim is to help you identifyyour beliefs, help you evaluate them for alignment to your goals, and, if foundunfit, help you replace them one by one. My clients slowly started working onher self- sabotage and belief. Today she is a proud woman, full ofself-confidence, brimming with life and an example to others.So what works for you if you want to get out of the self-sabotage?The first is being aware of your beliefs. Most of the times, we do not realizethe existence of beliefs that we carry. In the above case, I asked my client towrite down what she feels in front of a person or strangers, and if she couldnotice a pattern of fear or anger in her feelings. I, then, encouraged her towork on these issues during her “quiet time” by trying to address them with loveand compassion.The second is taking responsibility of your own life and actions. It isimportant to create some values in your life. It can be as simple as waking upearly, doing something that helps you to grow as person, or getting to discovernature. Values help in grounding and it provides a sense of belonging.What other says often upsets people. We need to remember that we all carry ourown perceptions and if someone does not fit in our paradigm, we react bydenouncing them, making them feel down or shaming them. You can change or mouldonly your perception; it is hard to change others.If someone criticize you with the intention of shaming you for things in pastwhile you are trying to heal, you need to see that person with empathy. Theother person’s belief to feel strong or loved comes from shaming others but theythemselves are lost souls.As a kid, we all are born beautiful and worthy. However, instead of buildingupon this beautiful fact, most of the time what we experience is totallyopposite of it.Let me give you another example – one from my own life.As a kid, I wanted to write and do theatre as these activities made me happy.When I was growing up, writing and acting were never appreciated as ‘serious’professions to pursue. Given my fondness for writing and acting, I rememberbeing punished, as I was too busy preparing for my school’s annual functiondrama or writing stories at the back of my mathematics book. One of my teacherscalled me STUPID and said I would never pass from school. As a kid, I wasshattered and shame engulfed me. I remember getting fever every now and then,and did not enjoy the school. My body was showing all the signs of something,which I believed was not right. Eventually, my creativity took a back seat and Istart preparing for my exams. I passed with distinction but for a very longtime, I thought I am not talented or smart. My belief was so strong that insteadof applying for an admission in a good college (where I could have gotadmission), I ended up applying at colleges, which did not have good standing.My belief about me being stupid and untalented continued to grow stronger witheverything I did. If you have one belief, you start creating many ‘sub beliefs’to support that belief. I enrolled for computer programming course. I excelledin the examinations, but I thought (believed) it was my luck that the questionswere too easy. By the time I married, the self- criticism and my self- sabotagewere deeply rooted in me. I did not feel like being loved or like deservinglove. And I received exactly the same response from people around me – aboutbeing unworthy and unloved. My ‘shame’ that I am not worth anything made me feelI was not attractive too. Instead of talking about my vulnerability with myclose ones, I moved towards food. Eating is your best companion when you aresuffering from shame, depressed or loneliness. Food never talks back to you; itdoes not criticize or judge you. They help you forget your worries. No wonder,very soon I was overweight. As my belief got stronger every day, I stoppedcaring about myself. In order to earn respect and love from others, I becamevery giving and tried hard to please people.One belief gives rise to more beliefs in time. If the first belief is positive,the subsequent beliefs (or the sub-beliefs) too are positive and help you findthe purpose in your life. However, if the first belief is self-negating, thenthat, combined with other sub-beliefs makes you sink in them making you aprisoner within your own body with shame and guilt.When you are shaming yourself you always have three persons around you - one whoshames you, second who is a witness and the third who shows empathy.Depending on the level of your shame, at times, you have to wait for long forthe third person to come to your life.When the third person came to my life, my self-sabotage and limited beliefstarted getting weak. I started noticing the deterioration of my body, which wasgetting weaker day by day. I seriously questioned to myself:1. Why do I need other people’s approval to feel worthy?2. My beliefs are not giving me happiness; it is worth to feed it?3. Do I need to create something else to feel grounded and supported?4. I need help.5. I need to create new belief for myself.How do you approach your deep-seated belief? To change your belief that is notserving your purpose, at first you need to be aware of them, to identify thosebelief that are prompting you on a course of self-sabotage. Then you need toidentify how they are harming you and finally acknowledge how deep rooted theyare in your system. The deeper their roots are, the harder it would take touproot them. More depth needs more patience, more love and more time. You needto express your emotions behind the belief leading to self-sabotage - the anger,sadness, tears, love, gratitude, forgiveness and compassion towards your ownself. These all are part of it.My belief that I am a good writer came true when people started following mywriting. And it was not easy. Expressing yourself, after years of silence wasthe first step towards it. I started writing for myself. Then I started sharingit. After sometime, I started receiving positive comments on my writing (with afair share of negative comments too, which I chose to disregard!). This gave mecourage to open a hitherto unknown door of my belief, to see a vast field oflavender – the color of enlightenment.I distinctly remember my first workshop in the UK. I was stricken by a firmbelief that I am not a native english speaker and hence, conducting a two-hourworkshop for native english people was scary. It took a lot of effort to counterthis belief. Add to it, a deep-rooted belief of being stupid and unworthy! Tocounter this negative belief, I had a positive belief that I know what I want toconvey to my audience, and I am good at it. I address that fear by my opening myworkshop with my admission about my strong Indian accent and poor vocabulary. Iasked my audience to interrupt me, if they did not understand what I was saying.At the end of two hours, I was the one most (pleasantly) surprised that no onehad interrupted my talk once, for not following what I wanted to convey!My next desire, stemming from my penchant on writing was to publish my own book.My first little tiny book “A Pearl for this Day” was published on Amazon as ane-book in 2013. It was not a best seller. Nor did it get nominated for anyprize! But it did not make me unhappy. I was taking one baby step at a time. Thefact that I published a book germinated another belief in me on my ability towrite. And now, I am working on a major book on the value of Chakra system. Ihave achieved this by looking deeply inside me, my belief system, my perceptionsand the rules, which I created for myself based on my fear and shame. Once Idecided not to adhere to those rules, the beliefs and the perceptions, everyobstacle started disappearing from my mind, making way for new, positivethoughts and perceptions. As an astute farmer, we need to keep an eye on ourgarden to see that weeds do not spoil the beautiful lavender field.I mostly work with women clients. One day I got a call from a man who sought myhelp. As an ex-personal trainer, I had worked with lots of men. However, as alife coach this would have been my first experience. The person had beenfollowing my writing for a long time and decided that I could help him. Hedesperately needed my help but I was not sure whether I would be able tounderstand his spiritual and emotional self to help him. My belief or self-limitation told me that being a woman, I was an excellent coach for the clientof the same sex, but may not be able to appreciate the spiritual needs of aperson from opposite sex. The more I thought about it, the more I could discernthe fallacy in my argument. And then I thought if nothing else, it would help meto understand two men in my life – my growing son and my grown-up husband! Idecided to accept the challenge and signed up my new client.My first meeting with him went very well. My new client was a successfulbusinessman who came to me seeking help for constipation and recurring kneeproblem. As with any other client, I could see that his ailments weresymptomatic of deep-rooted issues. And, it took him longer to open up, to admithis issues. In our society it is okay for a woman (weaker sex!) to ask for help,to cry and to talk about her weakness. For man, it’s a different set of rulesaltogether.The male child is bred to be strong, to protect the weaker sex. He is taught toresolve his issues on his own, without seeking help from any one else. He isexpected to hide his emotions – “don’t cry like girls!” this ‘manliness’ resultsin a man hiding his emotions and his expressions deep in his body. As they donot get expressed; they accumulate in your body, in your mind. As a result mostmen suffer from ailments such as diabetes, heart issues, stiffness around neckand shoulders.After some session, I gained my client’s confidence to explore his issues. Hecame from a family where his father was very strict and disciplinarian. Hismother loved kids, but would never go against her husband. During childhood, myclient loved to sing. His singing was never appreciated in the family (remembermanliness?) and was discouraged. The discouragement made my client believe thatsinging would be a curse to his family. He became quite, went to a prestigiousschool and university, now owns his own business. He was successful in everysense – a provider, a good son to his parents, a loving father to his childrenand a good husband. Yet, in one of the sessions, he mentioned he saw himself asa failure and that that nobody listened to him except his daughter.I asked my client to define success and failure and this is what he came upwith:• Having enough money in bank is must.• You should be a perfect example for your family as a good provider.• Your own sacrifice counts for family prosperity and happiness.• Failure is not achieving any of these.When we discussed happiness, what surprised him most that he was making everyonearound him happy, but at a cost; in return he was making himself unhappy. Acommon belief that most of us carry from childhood is that someone else isresponsible for our happiness.My client was very attached to his daughter as she was inclined towards singing.In his daughter he found his long-suppressed desire to sing. He made her believethat she was a good singer and that she should pursue singing with all intent.There was nothing wrong in his encouragement; through this he was indirectlyfulfilling his own unfulfilled desire. He might achieve some happiness but hisown desire to sing would not be completely fulfilled.The next task that I had for him was to focus on happiness: If he could reversehis childhood what was one thing that would he like to do? what is one act orthought which would bring greatest happiness to him? And which belief does heconsider to be like a prison to him.His belief that he will be unfaithful or disrespectful to his parents was forthe first time challenged when he decided to sing again. He enrolled at a localsinging class. He wanted to give his parents and family a surprise on Mother’sday by singing for them. By enrolling for the singing lessons, he replaced hisold belief with a new belief, that which was positive and served him happiness.His belief that singing will upset his parents was gone too. His physical bodystarted showing a sign of improvement. Knee is where we store our chronic fear.Once my client started releasing his anger, sadness and explored his talent hecould notice a definite improvement in his knee problem.Most people can bring drastic change in their quality of life by identifying thetop five or ten of their limiting beliefs and changing them. Each belief haspower to create unhappiness or joy in your life. And as every belief has subbeliefs within it, so if you have a belief you are not worthy, will create moresub beliefs on various aspect of self-loath. And on the contrary, a goodpositive belief spawns many sub-beliefs to support the positive belief. On asubconscious level, every belief has a secondary benefit. A secondary benefitmeans that while something causes pain or discomfort on one level but it mayprovide pleasure on another level. This is the reason why we protect ourbeliefs, even after being aware that they are not helping us. We createjustifications for our beliefs. For example, a client, who was unhappy with herjob and yet she was fearful of changing her job. Her secondary belief was evenif she changed her job, the new job would be like the current one. Thissecondary belief provided her the ‘comfort’ to stay in her current job.“When patterns are broken, new world emerges.” - Tuli KupferbergWe create meaning in whatever we do. And this meaning is deeply connected to ouremotions. Hence, our emotions are in alignment to the meaning that we havecreated. If you create a meaning on your unworthiness, it is very likely thatyou will experience emotions that are negative. I come across people who areangry with someone and they believe it is the person who has made them angry. Inreality, that anger must have been carried inside since some time and the personwho they are blaming may no longer be present. This is the emotion that they arecarrying. You are the cause of any emotions that you carry. If you understandthis, then you will understand your own power to stop it any time you want.“Let go of all that is no longer serving you and realize thatan infinite power lies in your present moment”. Mateo TabatabaiWe make our own rules for success, happiness, health, in short everything thatmatters to us. I often get clients who say they would be happy after losing ‘x’amount of weight and then their relationship would also improve. So losingweight becomes a belief, on the success of which rests the key to theirhappiness. Like a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow! There are some for whomearning a certain amount of money is believed to make them happy or winning alottery! The truth is it never does. We create our belief in future merely toprovide ourselves comfort in the present. So we do NOT take care of the present– to improve our living conditions, and chase a rainbow in the future for themythical pot of gold! In addition, the rules that we create – the beliefs – areusually, not practical or worth and hence destined to fail. The failure, in turnspawns another belief about our unworthiness. This cycle goes on and one tillone day we just give up hope or seek help to change ourselves.As we think of the same thoughts and entertain the same beliefs, we experiencethe same outcome. You need to create awareness of your beliefs to be able tochallenge them and attempt to change them.“Lets us not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness.”We stop living in present and worry about the future. Are we aware that todaywas the future of yesterday for which we had worried?Being aware of your belief requires a quite time. Sometime people find it hardto be quiet. Having a quite time does not always mean meditating. There are manyactivities that can calm you like making Mandala, which is a art created throughenergy and the colors represent your state of mind, or gardening, walking innature, making something from Lego or going for a ceramic class, anything thatwill teach you how to live in this present moment.Being aware of present brings quality to the normal thing you do. If you haveprepared dinner, present in a way to make it special; if you’re spending time athome, dress up as if you were going out; just making an effort to do somethinggreat by being in present and being aware of it. When did you last sit down withyour child and listened to their stories – just you and your child, no TV at thebackground. When did you listen attentively to someone – without your mind‘judging his or her motive’? Being in present one hundred percent creates newmeanings and beliefs to your own world.Getting under the root of any belief is like digging deeper and deeper in earthtill you find the water. It is painful and sometime it is very scary too. It islike invading in a strange zone where nothing is familiar. Like an invader, youhave to be ruthless; you need to crush your old beliefs that are no longerserving you.If we wish our lives to be different in the future it is necessary to change ourbelief today. This, in turn, changes our thinking and emotions, and finally ourlives. And it does not end there; it also impacts others around you.If the belief is good it starts spreading the emotions of happiness, positiveenergy radiates outward. Our physical body shows the sign of health. 37.png [../images/00033.jpeg] If the belief is negative it brings back hatred, jealous, envy, worthlessnessand it affects our physical body because energy gets trapped inside.Self-sabotage arises from our beliefs. When our belief – and myriad sub-beliefsreach a stage that overpowers us, we move to self-sabotage. It is the ultimateform of expression for the one practicing it – a cry for help, for recognition,for acknowledgement.When I was approached to write for this book, before writing, a thousandthoughts crossed my mind and worried me – who will read this book, how will itbe received, will it be good enough….And the thoughts went on and on. As Ibecame aware of the beliefs, I calmed myself and started writing –one thought ata time. Very soon that thought spawned the other, then the other and the resultis what you are reading now.You were born to write your own play. You are the director of your play and itis you who has to decide what type of play you want to create and watch. I betwe all like to watch something meaningful and which has got purpose. Look atyour life and the potential that you hold inside. It is our false beliefs thatbecause of some event in our childhood we have left the true essence of life. Weare born perfect. Why doubt that perfectness now? During consultation I alwaysask all my clients “what do you want to leave behind as your legacy?”Give a good thought on this and when you will get the answer, you will knowwhich belief has to be replaced by others.

What is the Big Challenge? Why do we gain weight?Why do I fall sick?Where do I find a solution? Should I go to a Gym or should I first visit adietician?Better still, let me join a slimming classAll tried and tested solutions, proven testimonials by housewives andcelebrities. Before and after photographs. Logical conclusion “surely theseinstant solutions will work for me!’Sorry to disappoint you but you are wrong, wrong, wrong!Today there are various solutions towards weight loss and attaining a fit body.However all these strategies for weight loss lack in one importantelement-dealing with the battle of the mind, which is essentially the mostimportant battle.Come to think of it...If one could control one’s cravings towards chocolate cake (or any other cravingfor that matter)...If one could remain enthusiastic towards exercising on a daily basis...If one could follow the healthy diet chart without any cheating......Would one need to shop around for finding an external agency to help us winthe battle of weight loss?It is here that the role of NLP comes in.What is NLP?‘NLP’ stands for Neuro Linguistic Programming. ‘Neuro’ refers to the way weexperience the world through our senses; linguistic refers to the way we uselanguage to make sense of the world, capture and conceptualize our experiencesand then communicate that experience to others; and programming addresses theway we code (mentally represent) our experience and adopt various behavioralpatterns of response.In short, NIP is a powerful mechanism involving the programming of our mind. Itcan impact you both professionally and personally. It is applicable to allspheres of one’s life-be it weight loss, overall health, business managementpsychology and all forms of personal development.NLP can help you with:• It can remove the mental barriers blocking you from reaching your goals andset new higher expectations from yourself.• Replace negative behaviors and habits with positive ones.• Transform the way you go about everyday tasks.• Better understand you own motivations, needs and behaviors to have thegreatest impact in your life.NLP helps you understand your current mind as each person has their own uniquemap of the world. It helps you unlock the subconscious beliefs, limitations andfilters that you have created and stored in your mind.Be it with respect to fitness or your ability to lose weight.NLP will help you change your mental perceptionNIP will help you understand that emotion which drives you to eat more andexercise less. It will help you to come up with alternative solutions towardssatisfying that emotion. Find alternate mental and emotional states that leadyou to overcome eating disorders, exercising less, staying depressed and beinglethargic.We humans represent the world to ourselves with our senses• Visual (What we see)• Auditory (What we hear)• Olfactory (What we smell)• Gustatory (Taste)• Kinesthetic (Our Emotions)It is possible to enhance or depress the qualities or attributes of therepresentations you make by using your five senses and their sub modalities. NLPcan help you frame a picture of your favorite physical activity in your mind. Itcould be going to the movies, dining at your favorite restaurant, your favoritefood or being with your best friend. The technique will help you visualize yourmental picture in color and with intensity.It will help you to evoke a positive response to it.NLP can also make you visualize another picture in black and white and make youtake notice of your response. The technique can change your sub modalities bybringing closer or pushing certain images further away from yourself, in doingso the technique can help you to love something or in turn detest some otherthing. NLP can help you to stop procrastinating and to act on what is good foryou. The interesting thing to note here is that once you understand that youcreate your internal world, you realize you can change it.Here is a Technique You Want to TryThe Swish Technique• If you eat food which is not good for you and you want to change this habit,you should try this technique• Shut your eyes and imagine yourself eating hot chocolate fudge ice- cream. Nowthink of a healthy food item which you’d rather have instead. Perhaps...I’drather have a bowl of yoghurt instead of chocolate.• Shut your eyes and now imagine a picture of eating yoghurt. Mentally picturehow you feel the positive emotion whilst eating healthier food. Visualize thisnew picture as big, bright and close to you...• Next gradually shrink this yoghurt eating and feeling picture, making itsmaller and dimmer. Gradually push it into the right hand corner of your brain.• Open your eyes.• Bring back the Hot Chocolate eating picture (your craving) in your mind.• Make it bright, big and close to you as possible. Remember, you still have onthe right hand corner the dim yoghurt eating picture.• Say ‘SWISH!’ and expand the small picture into a big one such that it coversthe chocolate eating picture. Feel the positive emotion that you would feel ofeating a healthier food. Open your eyes.• Do the Swish 10-12 times. Each time Swish it faster and faster.• Open your eyes.Result: You would have either forgotten about your craving or would have the 2ndpicture in your mind. Practice the Swish technique on yourself on a daily basis.The more you do it on yourself, the more the success shall be of this technique.The Swish technique is also equally successful in curing you of your bad habitsbe it biting nails or to attain one’s ideal body image.Tarini Khetarpal is a Certified NLP Master Practitioner from the NLP Academy.She has learnt NLP from the pioneer of NLP himself, Mr. John Grinder in London.She has been in the field of training for 5 years and has conducted 800 +training programs on various avenues.

Itwas a Lebanese restaurant where a “coffee reader” of considerable repute wasavailable a couple of times a week. A coffee reader makes you drink a sip ofdense black coffee and then “reads” the trails and marks left behind in your cupto reveal some insights about your life. They also answer your questions aboutyour life much like a palm reader or a tarot reader does.Due to the difficult emotional period I was going through following my father’ssudden passing away, my cousin wanted me to meet the coffee reader and find somesolace in his insights and predictions. Although, skeptical of occult sciences,I was open to the idea. I suppose when your heart is broken due to the loss of aloved one, you become more open and vulnerable. I was looking for any fragmentsof hope and reassurance that I could find amidst the complete disorientation andconfusion I was feeling as a result of my father’s unexpected demise.I can recall clearly the words of the coffee reader (as translated from Frenchby my cousin) as if it was yesterday, “Your heart and head are not connected.” Iremember asking my cousin and my best friend who accompanied me, “What does thismean? what does it feel like to have a connected heart and mind?” I really wasinnocent in my cluelessness; I could not fathom what it even meant to have adisconnected heart and mind, let alone to experience a connectedness.Switching to what was happening with my body and my health. I was overweightever since I stopped playing basketball after college. It was slow to build upat first but when I moved to the US, I ballooned to a gigantic 95 kilos! In2007, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and put on medication and soonafter diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, a chronic autoimmune and degenerativedisease. My journey of re-connecting my head and heart or mind and body hadbegun.In 2009, after further deterioration of my hypertension, I was taking 3medications a day to control it and suffering from various side effects. Inaddition, I was on multiple medicines for Rheumatoid Arthritis. My health futurelooked bleak. I felt depressed and could not see any hope on the horizon.Following the crash of the economy that year, I lost major projects as acorporate trainer and circumstances led me to focus on myself and my failinghealth. At that time, I sent out a heartfelt intention to the Universe asking tolearn more about connecting better with my body and to heal from my variousailments.To cut a long story short, in my search for healing, the Universe conspired tosend me various books, videos, healing techniques and teachers. Collectively,they led me to a path where I found the clues to put together the puzzle oftraversing the journey to connect my head to my heart.I released 25 kilos effortlessly and more miraculously, this time I managed tokeep it off! I completely recovered from hypertension and no longer take anymedications to control it. The four pillars of health are my offering to thosesearching for answers to their own health challenges.First PillarThe first and foremost pillar is food. No one taught me at school or at homewhat exactly was the natural diet of our species. In fact my natural abhorrenceof milk, for example was overridden by adding sugar and other chemical additivesto make it more palatable. Animals and their products were regularly served onthe table and belonging to a Punjabi family that was a treat we all lookedforward to.During my quest for healing in my early 40’s, I came across the work of Dr.Colin Campbell, author of “The China Study”, a seminal work about the effects ofnutrition in a large population and the harmful effects of meat, dairy andprocessed and refined foods.Soon after I met Dr. Nandita Shah of SHARAN who has been working in the area ofpreventing and reversing lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heartdisease and even cancers and auto-immune issues through educating people aboutfood that supports health and how to prepare it. After attending her one-dayseminar entitled Peas vs. Pills, I finally understood the real meaning of ournatural diet and how to eat to prevent disease and maximize the natural healingpowers of our body.There are many medical doctors in the US practicing and teaching the healthbenefits of a “whole, Plant-based Diet” to cure a myriad of diseases. Some ofthese, whose books, websites and videos have inspired me, are: Dr. Joel Fuhrman,Dr. John McDougall, Dr. Neal Barnard and Dr. Caldwell esselstyn among others.Adopting this abundant and wholesome diet into my life has been one of the mostrewarding and centering decisions of my life. I have not only improved my healthon all fronts but also feel good that I am doing the best for the environment byeating lower on the food chain. It has also awakened compassion within me and Iam at peace that no animals are harmed in order to feed me. It is a clean andwholesome feeling from inside that always leaves me at a loss for words when Itry to explain it.Finally, I experienced a connection and oneness with my body with this singlemost important change in a way that shifted and evolved my life in many positiveways. I understood the meaning of the Hindi saying from our shastras – “Jaisaann, vaisa mann” or “Like food, like mind” or the more famous english phrase,“You are what you eat.”Adopting a plant based, whole food diet is an affirmative, sustainable andtangible action for everything I believe in – compassion for all beings on theplanet, healthy living and minimizing my carbon footprint by inculcating eco-friendly habits. And I get to live and practice my beliefs 3 times a day with myfork. Lucky me!Second PillarAs you would easily guess, the second pillar of health is about activity andmovement, also called exercise. I prefer to use the first two words as“exercise” often has negative and effortful connotations for many. Before Ibegan my own journey of self-healing, I was extremely sedentary and theexcruciating pain of rheumatoid arthritis made me even more lethargic.One day I was sitting on a park bench after another failed attempt to stir upenough energy to go for a walk. I watched as two little birds flitted back andforth from a tree to the ground immersed in incessant chatter. They seemed to bereally busy organizing things for their day. I wondered where the birds got allthe energy as I felt drained and spent. (This was before I adopted a wholeplant- based diet.) Looking up, I saw in the distance a really old woman, bentover in half, walking at a snail’s pace. Within me a tiny voice said, “If shecan do it so can I. If the birds can do it and the old woman, I can try it too.”Every morning, a battle of sorts went on in my mind about whether or not to getup from the comfort of the bed. My lazy side always won this battle. I thoughtwhat is the minimum I can commit to doing, bare minimum at which I really cannotfail. And all I could come up with was to wear my shoes. And so I began wearingmy walking shoes first thing in the morning and standing up. I was open to thepossibility that my shoes may want to take me somewhere. What I realized wasthat once I was out and moving, my body wanted to move more and the mind took abackseat. Slowly, I made daily walking a regular habit.In the middle of my weight release journey, I discover the whole plant baseddiet and 3 months after I went on it, I had so much surplus energy that Istarted jogging. I had never been interested in jogging ever as it always seemedtoo effortful to me. But after the new way of eating, I was like a child whocould not walk but had to skip or run!The self-motivating strategy to get into the routine of moving more is to startwith some minimal activity and make it a daily habit in your lifestyle. Even nowwhen the old inner resistance comes up, I fool my mind by saying, just 10minutes, just one round of the park. And once I am down there my body decideswhen to stop walking.Take up any activity on a daily basis. It does not have to be the gym if youdon’t like the gym and it does not have to be early morning if you are a nightperson. Make it any time of day and any type of activity that fits into yourlifestyle. You can play with the kids, climb stairs, park a little further, puton a piece of music and dance to it in the privacy of your room, walk in themall – absolutely anything as long as you move a little more than usual. Youwill find that the more you move, the more you would want to move. This is thesecret of adding more physical activity into your daily routine.Third PillarPositive, wholesome thoughts are the third pillar. Ultimately, the controlcenter to change our lifestyle is in the head. Unless we change our thinking, wecan’t really hope to change much in our lives.For years, I did not like what I saw in the mirror. I disowned the personlooking back at me, as she did not meet my ideal image of what I thought I“should” look like. I just rejected everything from my neck downwards refusingto really acknowledge it as my body. This is perhaps what was at the crux of thedisconnectedness I felt between my heart and head.The sub-conscious communication I was giving myself was that I would love myselfafter I looked like what I wanted to look like. In other words meet someidealized slim and sexy version of myself. And this was clearly not happeningfor over 20 years! Finally, I realized if I had to shift my relationship with mybody, I had to start loving it exactly as it was. Right here. Right now. Not inthe future. Not when it looked like this or that but exactly as it was rightnow.This was a revelation and I began to be aware of my self-talk or the words I wassaying to myself in my head. I realized that I was judgmental and unkind in theway I spoke to myself. So, I cleaned up my act and started talking to myself asI would to a beloved friend. The conversation inside my head changed myrelationship with my body and I became aware of the times my body wascommunicating back with me too to guide and support me. I developed a newrespect and love for my body and its infinite and divine intelligence.I started getting clues, signals and messages that taught me when to eat andwhen to stop and what my body was asking for in terms of nutrition at any giventime. Before putting just about anything in my mouth, I started checking in withmy body first and this was a crucial practice which helped me to get to my goalsof weight release.Fourth PillarThe final pillar is one of habits - the childhood, family and socialconditioning that we get set into without questioning. These habits stem fromthe beliefs we carry around all our lives. We may have inherited these from ourfamily and friends or picked them from our doctor or read it in books and papersor simply followed the societal norms. Sometimes, we just call it ourpersonality and refuse to budge or change anything saying, “I am like thisonly.” This is all inner resistance to change, our invisible dragons that we aremeant to slay in our journey to evolution and self-awareness.More often than not, we are not even sure why we are doing it, but we are doingit e.g. Drinking milk – we do it because everybody does it and the prevailingparadigm is that it is good for health and the best source of calcium. As if godput the cow on earth to provide calcium for humans. How come no other animal onthe planet needs cow’s milk for its calcium needs? Say an elephant, a horse or adeer? Once I started questioning the established paradigms and norms, my bodystarted revealing the reality and truth of the moment and my true educationbegan.I realized that the body never lies and is always in the present moment. Themind lies constantly and its predominant nature is fear, doubt and judgment.However, if we can love our minds with understanding, we can access the wisdomof our bodies. Our bodies have the capacity to guide us home about our healthand physical wellbeing. We don’t really need any external expert to do this forus. In fact the entire healing system of “Natural Hygiene” or “Naturopathy” isbased on the self-healing capacity of the body. All we have to do to healourselves is to get out of our own way and let the body do what it knows to dobest which is to maintain a state of health.Incorrect beliefs about what is the right food to eat are very strong and hardto release. Then there are unhealthy and addictive habits like smoking,drinking, chewing gutka, which we may have picked along the way and now we arehooked to them. Seeming less harmful but being equally addictive and harmful toour health is addiction to tea, sugar and fast foods like pizza and burgers orprocessed foods like fried namkeens, chips, commercially sold mithais, packagednoodles and biscuits etc.Not doing some form of physical exercise is also a habit that is difficult tobreak and so are mental addictions like playing the victim and blaming everyoneelse for everything that goes wrong in our lives.In my 12-week program, designed to help people adopt healthier and morewholesome lifestyles, we explore all the four pillars. Health is not just aboutfood or just about exercise or just about spirituality or just about having afew good habits; it is multi-dimensional and permeates every aspect of ourexistence. Becoming aware of all these four aspects brought me back to wholenessand helped me integrate my disjointed heart, body, mind and soul.I am eternally grateful to the many teachers that have guided and inspired me onthis journey to live a more connected and abundant life. I wish you the verybest of health and much happiness.Nandini Gulati is a Holistic Health Coach. She offers many programs to helppeople lead healthier and integrated lifestyles.

In spite of all these developments inweight-loss industry, obesity is constantly on increase.So why don’t most people lose the desired weight even though they have triedover and over?This question has been bothering so many of us for so many years. Most peoplemake the decision to exercise and eat right but some challenge comes up thatsabotages their weight loss plans and they give up. However we know of otherpeople who one day determined to lose weight and became healthier than anyoneever imagined. If we understand the crucial distinction that makes thedifference between these different set of people, we can be a part of the oneswho get the desired results.Why Diets don’t work?Extensive studies show that around 95 per cent of all people who lose weightthrough dieting alone subsequently put it back on again. Most of the diets relysolely on restriction of food intake and no way teach people to eat healthily,nor help them to modify their lifestyle. So, once you are off the diet, youreturn to your old eating habits and start piling your weight back on. Moreoverfad diets and unnatural calorie restriction actually causes your body to storefat more effectively, and create cravings for high-calorie foods thus drive youto bingeing no matter how strong your self-control is.Weight Loss, a quite complex issue!The process of weight loss is complicated and challenging because it is not justabout shedding pounds, it is about the awareness of how do you sense foodcravings. And it is a commitment towards personal change, which is alwaysinsight-out.As obesity is not simply a function of laziness, emotional instability, pooreating habits, lack of exercise or any other factor, there are several differentareas that probably need addressing for each individual regarding weight loss.And there may be lots of different types of temptations and issues that can cometo light when weight problem is properly dealt with. Perhaps you need to sitdown with someone close to you and discuss all the issues surrounding yourcurrent situation such as what you have tried in the past, what succeeded andwhat was difficult for you.Is your behavior under your control?The problem is that we believe we have more control over our behavior than wereally do. Stress, anxiety and addiction can limit the conscious control youhave over your choices. What drives your behavior is not logic but brainbiochemistry, habits and addiction, states of consciousness and the people inyour environment. We are emotional beings with the ability to rationalize andnot rational beings with emotions. If we are stressed, depressed or addicted, nomatter how good the advice we are given, chances are that we will not be able toact on it.Why are you not thin yet?There can be any of these patterns that may be responsible for your inability tolose weight till now.Pattern one: Obsessive Dieting (Are you a Yo-Yo Dieter?)Pattern two: emotional eating (Are you a Comfort eater or the DepressedOvereater?)Pattern three: Faulty Programming (Are you unable to visualize yourself thin?)May be you have other problematic patterns like speed eating and eating quicklycan delay the onset of ‘fullness’. A lot of us were brought up not to leave foodon our plates and you may not be able to resign the clean plate club.Fitness starts in your headOur body is the result of the choices we make. You don’t have right to complainabout your body if you are not willing to change. You must make health andvitality a must and choose to eat right, exercise regularly and treat your bodywith respect. You don’t have to be more fit than anyone else. You just have tobe fit than you ever thought you could be. Fitness is not 50% exercise and 50%diet but it is a 100% commitment to diet and exercise. It is rightly said thatfood is the most abused anxiety drug and exercise is the most underutilizedanti-depressant.Enough of all such excuses!• No time• Too busy• May be tomorrow• Not enough motivation• I love food• No willpower• I hate exercise• Too tired• Too hardIf working out is important for you, find a way, if not, you find an excuse.So are you ready to do something different?Now just imagine if salads could be more appealing than ice creams and exercisecould be something to enjoy. How much sense of control you could have felt?Using mind programming techniques and models, you can change your habits so thatyou can lose weight easily and effectively. Our brain works on pain- pleasureprinciple. And you can utilize this principle for your benefit instead of beinga victim to this principle. You can program your mind to associate enough painfor overeating and eating junk and immense pleasure for eating health andexercising.Weight loss through mind programming aims to help you to achieve permanentweight loss by breaking the patterns and habits of poor or over eating and takecontrol of your hunger and weight. Taking a psychological approach can help youdeal with the hidden patterns behind poor eating and over-eating as they occurdeep in your unconscious mind. Such an approach can be helpful in the followingareas:• Build up and maintain your motivation to lose weight• Prevent you from over eating• Motivate you to exercise• Help you make the right choices about the food you eat.• May even train you to eat slower• Deal with any issues you may have with regard to losing weight• Control your cravings• Overcome anxiety, depression and mood swings• Learn to be completely satisfied with smaller portions of food• Eliminate emotional baggage and control emotional eatingMotivate yourself to create the body you desire.Muscle weighs much more than fat but it is much better to look at. You don’thave to be great to start, but you have to start to be great. Some statementsthat you can use to charge yourself up:• I have reached the threshold, I must lose weight now.• I must take complete responsibility for creating the desired body.• I believe in my ability to get in shape.• My past failures in losing weight don’t bother me anymore.• Metabolism is not something constant, and I can easily increase my metabolism.Get clarity about what you really want and use the power of goal setting• What is your goal for your health?• What is most important to you? (Your longevity, your energy, your shape,avoiding disease, being healthy enough to enjoy your children or grandchildren?)• Be clear why it is compelling for you - Why are you absolutely committed tocreate a light and healthy body?• When you set a goal for yourself, it is important to understand exactly whatactions are necessary for you to achieve your goal.• Visualize your desired body to direct yourself to your result.Get rid of your food compulsions and choose to eat healthilyWhat are some of the behaviors that keep you from doing that that you currentlyengage in?Every action begins with an emotion. For example, if you have a habit of over-eating, there is an emotion and a chain of behaviors that lead you to overeat.Because the location of hunger is usually experienced between the centers of thechest to just below the bellybutton – in the exact places that we tend togenerate our emotional feelings. Hunger is not an emotion, but it does tend tooccur in the places that we feel our emotions. No wonder then that some peopleget it so confused.When you eat right you feel right. Junk food that you crave for a few moments isfar insignificant than the body you wanted for years. The junk food that looksgood out there looks bad when it is stored as fat on your body. Keep remindingyourself that it is just food, it cannot control you, and it doesn’t have anymagical power.Make Exercise a pleasure, not just a chore. Get the urge to move every day!What do you hate more – a 30 minute workout or those 30 extra pounds?30 minute of being uncomfortable with exercise is much better than beinguncomfortable for life.Believe it or not exercise is not the 8-letter version of work. It can be fun. Agreat workout helps you detoxify yourself mentally and physically. Let exercisebe your stress reliever and not the food! Losing weight means you look good inclothes, exercising means you can look good even without clothes. Complainingwon’t burn calories, only exercising will. Workout as if your life depends on itand it certainly does. For every minute, thinking about whether you shouldworkout or not, you could be working out. The more you sweat during the workout,the less you cry on the scale. So blast that music and work it out!Affirmations for making you enjoy your workout:• You see a sweat, I see a glow.• I don’t have the time to work out, I make time.• On good days, I work out, on bad days, I work out harder.• I wear black when I work out; it’s like funeral of my fat.Commit to yourself:• I will take the required action• I will eat healthy food• I will drink lots of water• I will exercise regularly• I will get enough sleepI Will See The Desired ResultsPreeti Subberwal is the Founding Director of Thoughtful Engagement, a firm thatfacilitates quick and sustainable change and transformation in individuals andorganizations through powerful and innovative programs.

Whathappened to that?When did you learn to be serious?When did you learn that laughing heartily was ridiculous?When did you learn to be realistic and put aside all those dreams you thoughtwere so within your reach?Who sold you the lie that life was a struggle?Who made you believe that you were limited by this reality? Whose reality didyou entrain to?Whose limitations did you buy as real and solid and then built your realityaround that?These are some of the questions I have been pondering on and strangely justasking these questions, leaves me feeling lighter and expansive. The invisibleweight on my shoulders lifts and I feel connected with the Universe and themagic of possibilities.All our gurus and scriptures tell us that we are infinite beings with infinitecapabilities, yet for all practical purposes, we believe our limitations aremore real than our potential, and create a life based on limitations rather thanpossibilities. I wonder why that is so.Elephants that are huge and powerful animals are made to wear a metal ankletwhen they are a baby, which hurts them if they try to pull on the rope attachingit to the pole it is tethered to. They get entrained to this pain and even asadult powerful animals believe they cannot pull on the flimsy chain tethered toa small wooden pole even though they are capable of pulling away an entire tree.Interestingly and sadly so, we humans are disempowered too by similar beliefswhich are untrue yet we believe those to be the truth. How many of us would liketo create and have a better life, a better job, better finances, betterrelationships, but are held back by seeming limitations of background, religion,gender, finances, pedigree, education, language, credentials etc.?How many of us stop dreaming about a better life as we grow up, as thelimitations that we think we have seemed to loom large in front of us? what ifall those limitations that we bought from our parents as the ultimate truth forus, were just beliefs that could be changed? what would happen if we began toquestion those beliefs that we bought as true for us? what if the beliefs thatworked for our parents did not really work for us? what would it take for us tobegin to question those beliefs and change what does not ring true for us?Access ConsciousnessI have always been a seeker all my life. The search for answers to basicquestions about life, about suffering, about pain, misery and sadness continuedto bother me and I attended seminars, classes, read books looking for solutionsand solace. I enjoyed learning Reiki, Quantum Touch, EFT, Pranic healing, Thetahealing etc. As I look back, starting from Bhakti Marg each one of the teachingsI came across offered a special nugget that was just right for me at that timeof my life, the search continued and my life continued to heal itself just likeLouise Hay says - You can heal your life, and indeed you can!Access Consciousness entered my life like a fresh breeze of ease. Like most ofthe people who will pick this book, I have been a seeker, looking for ways toease pain and suffering for self and others. Access is a large toolbox withtools to deal with just about everything. There are verbal processes, bodywork,and tools that can be used to shift and change anything that you would like tochange. Having used these tools for the last almost a year and a half, I nowfeel empowered and at ease with most things in life. There have been othermodalities that I have studied and applied over the years that have contributedgreatly as well, and Access has given the key to areas of my life that I hadmade peace with, having concluded that those areas were immutable and hencecould not be changed.Do you remember the exuberance you had as a child, when no pain or sufferinglasted for more than 10 seconds and you were happily skipping about seeingrainbows and joy oozed out of your being? Remember that questioning spirit youhad? And no question was too silly, you could ask ten question in a row of how,when, why, what about everything you came across?Where is that spirit of question now? Did it get smothered when the parents andteachers told you that your questions were too silly? Or did you perceive thesadness and defeat your questions invoked in them and therefore you suppressedthe urge to ask questions about changing stuff and started mimicking their wayof maintaining the status quo? Did they say you wasted too much time askingquestions when you should be learning the answers in your text books that youfound too boring? when did that boisterous spirit of knowing that you couldchange everything and that everything was mutable got smothered? when did youdecide that by aligning and agreeing with “this is how things are in our family”you could help create peace in your world? Or did you choose the other way roundof resisting and reacting to “this is how things are in our family” as your wayof creating peace and change in your world?Has any of that worked for you? If yes, please don’t read further. If not,please continue.Being in the QuestionOne of the biggest takeaways from Access Consciousness for me has been – to stayin the spirit of being in the question. Growing up, becoming serious about life,meant I had to give up that boisterous questioning spirit in favor of seekingthe theory- of- the- correct- way- of- living- life. Somewhere I also began tosuppress my own knowing about what was right for me, in favor of seeking answersfrom the adults who had more experience and therefore knew better than me. Ithought I could create a nice life for myself learning from other people’slives, trying to come to conclusions about what worked in other people’s livesand could therefore work in my life as well.Unfortunately, this trying to live by proxy hasn’t worked very well for me.Somewhere along the line, I gave up being me in favor of trying to become whatworked for other people rather than myself. As we start to live fromconclusions, we begin to shut off the magic of the Universe and limit thepossibilities of change showing up in our lives. Access encouraged me to startasking questions, and the best thing was I did not have to have the answers! Itwas a bit confusing as first and the habit of staying in conclusions or findingconclusions is so ingrained that it doesn’t come naturally to me to askquestions.So what happens when I remember to ask questions? Magic shows up,synchronicities happen! It can’t be that easy now, can it? well how can that be?Indeed how can that be? well, the way to go about it is that you ask a questionand then get out of the way, yes, get out of your own way! what happens when weask a question to the Universe is that it starts the quantum entanglements infavor of our question. Everything is interconnected, and in response to ourquestion, the Universe begins to rearrange itself to offer the most creative andbest ways to bring to us what we asked for. There are no co-incidences indeed;it is all coming to us through our own creations. But when we ask a question andcome to a conclusion, we limit the Universe and shut down the myriad pathwaysthat opened up. It’s like planting a seed one moment, and pulling it out thenext to see if it has grown yet.On the other hand when we ask a question without coming to a conclusion and stayout of being vested in the outcome, the Universe gets to work for us and opensup quantum entanglements so that the energy that matches the energy of ourrequest, brings together more such energies and new pathways get created and thepeople or circumstances required for the fulfillment of our desire come to uswithout too much effort on our part. It still requires some ‘doing’ but this‘doing’ happens with ease, without the ‘struggle’ part.Making a demand of the UniverseSometimes I ask the Universe to show me magic, show me the gifts that I havethat I haven’t acknowledged. And magic gets created in so many ways. Money flowsin unexpected. In sessions with people, the contribution they were looking forappears effortlessly, there is no hard work required, and it is a seamless matchof demand and supply, simultaneous gifting and receiving for both.The ProcessAccess Consciousness BarsWe have learned a lot of concepts through the Law of Attraction, Jerry andEsther Hicks (and now Esther) talk a lot about Ask and its given, and so manybeautiful ways of allowing the Universe to gift to us. With Access, using all ofthese concepts has become easier and effortless. ‘Access Bars’ is a therapy thatmakes ‘receiving’ from the Universe easier, each Bars session helps to releaselimiting beliefs that do not allow us to receive freely.The Bars is a hands-on process that requires gentle touching of 32 points on thehead, the worst that can happen after a Bars session is that you feel as if youhad a good head massage, and the best your whole life could change. The Bars aredesigned to open you up to receiving from the Universe, that too without mucheffort on your part. You just need to lie down and allow the practitioner totouch some points on your head. How does it get any better than this? There areBars points for money, control, creativity, time, hopes, body, etc. and when thepractitioner touches these points gently, limiting beliefs, thoughts, emotionsrelated to that area get released in the form of electromagnetic chargeresulting in greater peace and ease in these areas.Personally for me just this one process itself has brought in so much easewithin my life that I can hardly recognize myself. Each Bars session brings inmore peace and more ease, the stress melts away as if by magic. I feel soliberated and light now. There were some incidents from the past that I washolding on to, and those incidents defined my story and as Eckhart Tolle wouldcall it – when the “Pain Body” surfaced, those incidents and the charge oftrauma, pain, sadness, victimization etc. Would rear its head and I wouldrecreate the trauma and add charge to it to feed the “Pain Body” and quitesurprisingly now, there is no charge on any of those incidents and no need, andno desire to feed the “Pain Body” as well. This has been a huge contribution notjust to my life but to the lives of my immediate family as well, since my energyaffects not just myself but all of them too.Verbal ProcessingWhile giving a bars session to one of my clients, I sensed the bars for money tobe running with a lot of intensity, and asked if the client would like someverbal processes to facilitate more change in the money area. He agreed and weran some verbal processes after which he relaxed so much that he slept throughthe rest of the session. Much to my delight, the next day he shared that heexperienced a financial breakthrough in a case that he was following up for thepast six months.Verbal processing is a unique way of changing energy around things we wish tochange. When we talk about an issue that we wish to address, there’s an energythat comes up and around the subject. This energy is the solid wall that gets inthe way of our changing the things that we wish to change. This energy couldcome from either aligning or agreeing with others, or resisting or reacting tothem; instead of choosing from the space of being ourselves. It could also bethe limitations that other people think are real and solid for them but notnecessarily true for us. Access has a clearing statement that clears up theenergy that gets in the way of this change. The verbal processing brings up thischarge of limitations and shifts the energy thereby making it possible forchange to happen with ease.The Technique:I would like to introduce some tools for you to use in everyday life. One of thetools that I use most of the time is – HDIGABTT. Its not greek speak, it standsfor How Does It get Any Better Than This – use it for when things are goinggreat so you get more of the good stuff, and use it when things are not goinggreat to come to something better. An example of this which is often sharedduring Access seminars is – a lady learned this tool and on her way home, shefound a Dime on the pavement, she picked it up and said, how does it get anybetter than this? went a bit further and found $10 on the floor, and gleefullyasked, how does it get any better than this? She took a cab home and found adiamond bracelet and what did she say – it doesn’t get any better than this!This illustrates the way what we say affects the vibration we are in, whichaffects how the Universe responds to us. The energy of “how does it get anybetter than this?” is expansive and full of possibilities, whereas the energy of“it doesn’t get any better than this!” is that of closure and conclusions andthere’s no room left for further possibilities to show up.I have been using this tool along with “what else is possible?” for everysituation that I find sticky and it works like a charm every time. Have you evernoticed how we are conditioned to look at and prepare for everything that can gowrong, do we ever spend time looking at what could go right? Or if we share ourplans with others they tell us to stop daydreaming and come back to the realityof how things are supposed to be difficult by default. How often do we come toconclusions about things we can’t change and give up on things we would like tobe or have? what if instead of giving up we could just ask this one question(even if we don’t have the answers right away) - ‘what else is possible that Ihaven’t even considered’? This opens up possibilities that we haven’t evenconceived of! It’s like opening doors, windows and balconies in a corridor thatearlier had solid walls with just one door at either end, so now we can see andexplore options from a fresh perspective rather than looking at things the wayeveryone else does from the limited perspective.Likewise there are a lot of tools that Access offers to bring ease into everydaylife. What would it take for you to play with some of these tools and create alife with ease and joy?Another thought that I would like to leave you with is – Is this a benevolent,abundant Universe or a Universe of lack and scarcity? what happens when we allowNature to be, does it thrive? what would happen if we get out of ourconclusions, limitations and control over our lives and our future? would weallow the magic of the Universe into our lives? Could we???Seema Sharma is a certified Access Consciousness Bars Facilitator; a Marketingand Corporate Communications professional, she always had an active interest inEnergy healing techniques.

It isthe first thing you need to relax after a hard day at work. In a similar way,cleansing our system of toxins or pollutants internally is all we need to helpour body maintain a robust mechanism.Ozone is the element that is nature’s gift to us for cleansing and energizinginternally. It is revolutionizing medicine when it comes to healing andrejuvenation and its applications and benefits are evolving as we make progressin our understanding of it. However despite its proven benefits for over acentury and the fact that it has no side effects, ozone treatment has not yetentered the mainstream of alternative healing.As a result of general lack of knowledge regarding ozone and lack of access toozone clinics, millions of people are either unaware or cannot avail of itsbenefits. It is my deep aspiration to spread knowledge and awareness about thiswonderful element which can help us maintain our well being in the midst of ourenvironmentally challenged lives, where we need to be constantly attentive to anever increasing army of free radicals, heavy metals, pollutants, not to mentionthe mental and emotional toxicity that we gather everyday.My own experience with Ozone tells me that it is by far the best and simplestmethod for detoxifying the body, which is a basic requirement for any kind ofhealing, be it for an acute or chronic ailment. And here I will present a basicidea of what Ozone is, how it works, its healing properties, applications andhow you can combine it with other modes of treatment for faster healing andrecovery.It will surprise many people that Ozone and its healing properties werediscovered more than 150 years ago. We all know that Ozone plays an importantrole in our atmosphere’s composition as it protects life forms on earth fromharmful radiation of the Sun. Few are aware however of Ozone’s important effectson our body. Ozone is actually the most powerful regulator of our immune system.It is the main component in the redox system, which maintains a perfect balancebetween oxygenation and oxidation (between energizing our cells and burning upold dead, weak or damaged cells). It thus acts as a natural cleanser that keepsyour system free of germs, viruses, fungi and pollutants, and it boosts yourmetabolism and increases the oxygen content of your cells which is all you needto become free from any diseases.Medical doctors learn briefly about the redox system, but the medical textsthemselves basically misguide young medical students as they focus only on thedangers of oxidation and not so much on the positive aspects and even theessential nature of it. All free radicals are thought of as bad (which most are)but little or nothing is mentioned of the good free radical: the extra O1 intriatomic oxygen or ozone, and how it can actually discern the differencebetween healthy and weak cells and will only oxidize weak or damaged cells(contrary to chemo therapy which is a free radical that attacks and burns upeven healthy cells).The ProcessWhat is Ozone and how does it work?Ozone is a naturally occurring form of elemental oxygen, which is essential inmaintaining homeostasis or natural balance on the planet.Ozone is tri atomic oxygen, which means it has three atoms of oxygen temporarilyheld together. Because only two oxygen atoms can bond with each other, the thirdatom remains free to attach with any other atom. Oxygen being a beneficialelement, the third atom becomes a positive free radical and this is what makesit a powerful oxidant. Thus ozone oxidizes any negative free radical i.e.pollutants and effectively burns them up.Ozone in the atmosphere does the same thing on a macro level, neutralizing thepollutants in the air and in the water, in the same way our body does on a microlevel by oxidizing the toxins in our body.It has been determined by scientists at Scripps Institute, La Jolla, Californiathat the human body itself produces certain amounts of Ozone to oxidize its ownpollutants. This happens during the process when antibodies also known asimmuno-globulins fight off bacteria and kills them. However if there is anydisturbance in the number or efficiency of antibodies it is certain that thebody’s capacity to produce its own ozone is affected, which is the case withmost people having severe or complicated health problems.The following statement from Tom Harrelson elucidates the connection betweenozone and the cleansing of toxins in our body: “Since body is mostly water, andozone is primarily used throughout the world to eliminate any chemicals orpathogens in the water supply, than it stands to reason that ozone will also dothe same for water in your body, to clean and heal itself more efficiently.”If you look at the industrial uses of Ozone you can easily draw parallels to thekinds of benefits it can offer our body, which is no less complicated than agiant industrial plant with all its various systems serving different functions.Ozone and Healing:Ozone therapy can truly be called a futuristic as well as holistic healingmethod because it does not foster the divisive approach of modern medicine thatapproaches every disease state as a battle to be conquered, leaning on the fightand kill idea. Rather ozone therapy works by changing the very ground on whichthis so called battle of body v/s pathogens happens.And that ground is that of toxic waste, in the absence of which the battle endsand we regain our well being. The popularly accepted idea that the cause ofdisease is a germ or bacteria or virus is the result of the skewed perspectiveand manipulation of scientific studies done by ignorant scientists who were onlylooking at the subject from an isolated view.Pathogens are always present in the body, which has sufficient mechanisms tokeep their activity in check and maintain our health. However, the real cause ofdisease is the filthy pile of toxic waste which when not eliminated becomes averitable breeding ground for pathogens. As any game is a numbers game, theantibodies lose out to the fast increasing pathogens, which accumulate in a bodyoverloaded with toxins and we fall sick.However in truth, it is not the disease itself that is the real threat, it isour body’s unhealthy environment, which fosters disease that is the real causeof concern. If the toxic waste can be eliminated harmlessly, our body’s wellbeing can be assured. And nothing works better than ozone in this case.Ozone acts as a panacea, as it frees our system from its toxic waste without anyharm, enabling healing to happen naturally as the body gains control over itsvarious systems. If applied in the right way, Ozone therapy can eliminate theneed for many expensive and complicated treatments and minimize the time ofrecovery.We need to regularly detoxify our body; it is a need of the hour with everincreasing pollution and adulteration in our food and the chemical attackthrough many other products, if we do so we can give our body the cleanenvironment it needs to stay healthy.Instead of purchasing innumerable drugs to cure the countless ailments we face,we should rather shift our focus towards good nourishment and detoxification,which can fortify our body against any impending danger. Such is the efficacy ofthis approach that you can live fearlessly despite the threat of so often healthhazards highlighted by the media and medical fraternity.The Benefits of OzoneIn the same way you need a diamond to cut a diamond; free radicals can only behunted by another free radical. While pollutants are negative free radicals,ozone acts as a positive free radical and thus it kills or disables the negativefree radical without causing any harm to the healthy cells.The negative free radicals are responsible for causing degeneration, aging andmorbid conditions like cancer. Ozone with its O1 free radical only eliminatesthe diseased cell and does no harm to the healthy cells, how this happens hasbeen explained in detail in my book, ‘Heal Yourself with Oxygen’, but for asimplistic understanding I will explain how it works.What happens is that the harmful free radicals have a positive electronic chargeand the ozone free radical or O1 has a negative electronic charge and as we knowopposites attract. The negative charge of the ozone attracts the pilfering toxicwaste carrying the positive charge and neutralizes it and carries it out of thebody. The antioxidants contained in all the healthy cells are actually helpingthe process of oxidation. And all the healthy cells are bypassed when the O1seeks its pairing and thus the healthy cells remain unaffected.Unlike chemotherapy where healthy cells are also destroyed and the body isweakened, ozone therapy does no harm to the healthy cells and rejuvenates thebody besides cleansing it. Considering this benefit, ozone therapy should be theprimary method for treating not just cancer but many other ailments.It is important to know that, oxidation is a very key process of the bodywithout which the toxic waste cannot be neutralized and flushed out. The bodyhas its own mechanism for oxidation to occur; however ozone also acts very muchin the same manner as an external catalyst and boosts the process. When a personis suffering from severe disease and has high levels of toxic waste in the body,we need vigorous oxidation and the way to do this is to give an externalcatalyst to the system like ozone.Thus if the process of oxidation in the body can be boosted and regulated, anydisease can be easily controlled. Some key benefits of Ozone are that –• It disinfects the blood by destroying bacteria, viruses and fungi and byoxidizing chemicals and heavy metals.• It improves circulation by breaking down the clumping and rouleaux formationof red blood cells.• It stimulates the antioxidant system and it is a metabolic regulator.• It has marked effect on cellular metabolism.• It corrects intra cellular hypoxia (poor oxygenation) by regulating themitochondria respirative chain• It activates the nutritional exchange in the cell.• Stimulates and modulates the immune systemA detailed explanation of how these benefits actually take place is given in thebook. And readers can find in depth information on various internal physicalprocesses and how they parallel the way ozone purifies the oceans, lakes andstreams of the planet when it blends with the H20 in the clouds and rains downas hydrogen peroxide.The Spiritual Aspect of DetoxificationIn my own experience, all suffering is a wakeup call to see where we are out ofbalance in life. Serious ailments that shock us out of our slumber, give us anopportunity to finally tune in with awareness, to listen to the body/mind andintegrate the different aspects of our life that we have been out of touch with.For the mind it is awareness and observation which fosters growth and for thebody it is the cellular metabolism which is the key to well being. Both must betended to. Cells are the primary unit of the body, and thus if your body ishealthy on a cellular level you experience wellbeing. Cells thrive on two mainingredients, water and oxygen and thus if we supply our body with sufficientwater and take in good amounts of oxygen, we can support our body in maintainingits systems without any malfunction or disturbance.Health and wellbeing are required by everyone, no matter what our focus in lifeis. However for those who wish to wake up and are working toward their spiritualevolution, they especially need regular detoxification to ensure that theirefforts are not dampened by a lack of cellular well being.This is the very reason why fasting has been practiced by seekers in alltraditions, as it is a natural way of detoxification. With today’s lifestylehowever, unless you do periodic retreats, you cannot avoid day-to-dayactivities, which need your time and energy. In such a condition, long fastingis neither feasible nor advisable. It is for this situation that Ozone therapycan be used to obtain the similar benefits.The state of our body and mind is not different and each affects the other; theytruly are one continuum. Thus, if your body is full of toxins and waste, it willhamper your experience of the movement of finer energies in your body and yourawareness will be affected as a result. Only an efficient vehicle can sustainyou for a long journey and your physical wellbeing is the first and foremostcondition for developing your spiritual practice.Many pollutants also directly affect our thoughts and emotions and conditionslike bipolar disorder, depression, fatigue, lack of interest, confusion etc. arecaused by the presence of many of these harmful toxins in our blood.This statement by Dr. Kurt Donsbach illustrates how mind’s activity is relatedto the oxygen activity in the body; he says, “Negative Mental attitudes canbecome a major factor in oxygen depletion. Think for a moment perhaps youremember the last time you felt depressed. Were you breathing in a shallowfashion? In addition, the very thought patterns that are associated withnegativity and depression produce toxins in the body that increase the need fordetoxifying oxygen.”To include certain practices for our wellbeing and to follow them withdiscipline is a very small effort to make in order to gain health and longevity.Relying on drugs and taking an approach that deals with symptoms and not withthe actual causal factor of disease, only leads us to suffering both financiallyand physically.It is high time that we shift gears and adopt this simple and very basic therapyin our life and minimize the environmental impact on our body. When we ascertainour well being in a holistic way such as with the use of therapeutic ozone, wealso contribute to the wellness of the earth and its ecosystem because we arethe part of that same ecosystem and we are interconnected to all the variousstreams of life forms and life-elements of the earth.The Myths about OzoneLike any other alternative healing method, Ozone also has many misconceptionsand myths surrounding its applications and benefits. It is important that peoplebecome aware of the true facts about Ozone therapy so that they can dispel theirdoubts and make the prudent decision to incorporate Ozone in their treatment.A general myth about Ozone is that it is a toxic gas. The media, because of itsignorance of the whole story, propagates that high Ozone count in the atmospherecan cause allergies and irritation. However the truth is that Ozone is presentalong with pollutants to oxidize and thus burn them up. It is the burned upresidue of pollutants until dispersed that remain in the atmosphere, whichcauses irritation to our lungs.The fact is, in today’s heavily polluted atmosphere, the ozone amount is lowcompared to the smog, which means the process of oxidation is never complete.Thus the burned pollutants are not able to fully disperse, which is what causesthe actual problem to the lungs. In the same way if we breathe ozone directly,because we have so many toxins in our lungs, the ozone will immediately burnthem up and we end up coughing from the left over residue that has just beenoxidized. Thus ozone itself is not the culprit. If the air we breathed was purewe could theoretically breathe ozone without a problem.The ratio of Ozone to pollutants in smog is 1:3 i.e. pollutants are three timesgreater in quantity compared to ozone, however Ozone is often illustrated as themain component of smog and the highly harmful chemical pollutants are often notmentioned. This has created a gross misunderstanding about ozone and anunderstandable apprehension in people about Ozone and its application intherapy.If only the media were to act responsibly and do serious research and peoplecould become more aware about the essential role ozone plays in both the healthof the planet as well as the human body, Ozone would not be looked upon as atoxic or dangerous substance.Another myth about Ozone is that it is very unsafe to use in therapy. It is truethat when taken directly into the lungs continuously, it can be harmful for thereasons listed above, however when breathed through oil (turpene) it can alsoheal tuberculosis. When used in the right concentration, Ozone is verybeneficial. It is an obvious fact that any substance when used in extremequantities will be harmful, (you can drown from drinking too much water), and soOzone is not an exception to that.Ozone’s benefits are extensive in the various medical applications, which havebeen used on millions of people in Russia, germany and Cuba. Industrial use ofOzone is well established and many people are using ozonators in their homes aswell. When applied with the right guidance, Ozone therapy can work wonders foryour body.In a study done by the german Ozone Society in 1980, 644 therapists gave Ozoneinfusions to over 3,84, 775 people and only 0.007 percent reported side effectswhich were also only due to improper administration of the infusion. None of theside effects were serious or fatal, which is nothing compared to the thousandsof annual deaths reported in America due to the side effects of dangerousprescription drugs.In reality Ozone is a much safer therapeutic tool compared to what mostallopathic treatment has to offer. People should be encouraged to work withalternative therapists to study about Ozone therapy and make a confident choiceof using it for regular detoxification.The Tip:Applications of OzoneThe applications of Ozone are as varied as its benefits. Ozone therapy can beused for almost any ailment from malaria to cancer, allergies, infections,arthritis, diabetes, migraine etc. and even in diseases like HIV or AIDS.Ozone therapy can also be used for Hair treatment, eye Rejuvenation, Skintreatment etc. Besides an infusion of Ozonized saline for degenerative diseases,you can also drink freshly Ozonized water, use Ozonized Oil for Massage and takeOzone steam bath and Vaginal Insufflation.The book ‘Heal Yourself with Oxygen’ illustrates in great detail the variousapplications of Ozone mentioned here. Another area where Ozone treatment ismaking headway is dentistry. Ozone helps to stop the seeping of blood and thusit is very useful in dental surgeries. More important, it fully sterilizes thetooth in a way no other chemical compound can, giving the tooth a better chanceto heal and not become decayed under the new filling. The upcoming edition ofthe book covers an entire chapter only on the application of ozone in dentistry.It covers a new form of dentistry (Minimally Invasive Dentistry) which avoidshigh speed drills entirely that destroy the enamel on your teeth, which in turn,allows decay to seep in within a very short time. Also Biomimetic Dentistry -the science of rebuilding overly treated teeth without having to use crowns andeffectively destroy the whole tooth is discussed. This is vital information notonly for dentists but also for patients. It is my wish to inform more and moredentists across the world so that they become aware of the new art and scienceof dentistry which has been around for over thirty years but is still onlypracticed by about 5% of dentists worldwide due to simple ignorance and thegreed of certain industries.Many amazing experiences have been recorded with Ozone treatment for ailmentslike cancer, AIDS, Depression, Infertility, Alcoholism, Paralysis, Skin disease,Ulcers and many other problems. Ozone is also used in veterinary treatments aswell.Just like turmeric, basil, honey or any other natural element Ozone is nature’sgift for healing. In the same way we use these ingredients everyday in our homeremedies, ozone can be integrated into our daily detox program. All we need isawareness about Ozone and the initiative to take action.In combination with Ozone Therapy, I find that pulsed electromagnetic frequencytherapy is very beneficial, because it increases the blood circulation, whichthen helps carry the toxins out of the body which ozone effectively neutralizes.I personally use the Swiss IMRS machine, which I even carry on my long tours toovercome jet lag quickly (as it recharges the brain as well) and keep myselfenergized during hectic schedules.The IMRS machine increases our blood circulation through simulation of theearth’s natural magnetic frequency. It is a technology that was developed afterthe first Russian who went into space for two weeks came back with strongeffects of aging. They eventually discovered it was due to a lack of the earth’selectromagnetic energy that he was so depleted. Today, the earth’s preciousfrequency is also depleted due to a number of factors, so even if you walk alot, you still don’t receive the same effect our ancestors once did. Simplylying down on the IMRS mat and soaking in the energy has an amazing effect.Along with the blood circulation, it boosts the metabolism. It also has variedfrequency settings for different ailments and different times of the day. Irecently used it to heal a broken toe very quickly. There are many PEMF devicesavailable; however the IMRS is the most comprehensive in terms of “bells andwhistles”. It can actually measure your heart rate and adjust the frequency toyour need at the moment. This has complemented my self-healing practice (Reikiand diet) so well that I have seen some wonderful results in my own energy andstamina.Normally, a person with an acute ailment can feel the difference very clearlywhile lying on the mat, whereas with a healthy person, the energy is so subtleit is barely palpable during the treatment. However the relaxation andrejuvenation one feels after a PEMF Treatment is testimony to its effect.It is important to realize that blood circulation is the most important processof our body. We breathe to provide oxygen to our cells and blood is the carrierof this oxygen. If blood circulation is poor it can lead to many health problemsand any healing will not be fully effective if our blood circulation is not atits best. Healthy blood circulation is very crucial to detoxification and canpositively affect the detoxification process and reduce the healing time.Thus, I strongly recommend that people follow a protocol, which includes ways todetoxify and simultaneously boost the circulation. This includes drinking atleast three liters of water every day, which improves the viscosity of theblood, doing physical exercise to boost metabolism and making your heartstronger, and to do IMRS therapy on a regular basis.Many healing results have been experienced by people using PEMF therapy for anumber of different physical issues; similar to the way Ozone acts as a panaceafor healing. I believe that the combined effect of Ozone and PEMF can do wondersfor any patient.It is essential to remember, we don’t need to wait to be sick to avail ourselvesof these benefits. In today’s world, we need to do regular detoxification withthese therapies. Life is always a challenge as we learn and grow. If we arephysically and emotionally in good shape, it makes the journey so much easier.Today, ignoring health is like attempting slow suicide, as our bodies areconstantly overloaded with toxins even for those with the best diets andexercise schedules. Why wait for a life threatening disease to knock and giveyou a wakeup call? Make a commitment now to do at least twice a year majorcleanouts as well as some form of daily detox.It is my wish that through what is shared here, the message regarding thesignificance of Ozone and its role in detoxification and healing be noticed bymany. Humanity needs healthy people with open minds, and both need constant careand periodic cleansing to foster a flushing out of the inner dross, in form ofboth matter and energy.Dr. Paula (Laxmi) Horan is known worldwide for her numerous books, seminars andretreats on alternative and complimentary therapies, authentic forms ofvibrational medicine, integrative body/mind therapeutics and ground-breakingapproaches to spirituality and non - dual awareness.An American Psychologist born in Boston, she lived her childhood years in Italyand Germany.

Thisis why we are calling it “the 5th element of health.” Most people are familiarwith food, water, and oxygen being essential. Sunlight is also essential.We now know that there is a fifth element that is equally, if not moreimportant, than some of those others. In fact you can live longer without foodand sunlight than you can without the pulsed electro-magnetic fields of theearth. The good news is there are devices now available that actually simulatethe earth-based frequencies and can actually charge up all 100 trillion of yourcells. This is why we call PEMF a “whole body battery charger.”The Energetic Universe We Live InQuantum Mechanics predicts that each cubic centimeter of space has at least10^52 ergs or energy, which is more then a trillion-trillion nuclear explosions,or a one followed by twenty-four zeros. (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) Anamount of energy like that can drive our galaxy, and its one hundred- billionstars, for a million years! There is that much energy in every little cubiccentimeter.The solar wind is a relentless storm of energy emitted from the sun that racethrough space at fast and wildly fluctuating speeds of 200-700 km/second. Thisis actually what creates the Aurora Borealis or “Northern Lights.” The DynamoTheory explains that the magnetic field of the earth is dynamic and changing,not static, and these pulsing flows of energy create an enormous pulsingelectro- magnetic field throughout space. Modern cosmology-models predict ourvisible universe is only 4% of the total energy of the universe, with theremaining being mysterious dark matter and dark energy.Here on earth, we are in the relentless storm of energy emitted from the sun,along with lightening strikes (several million per day) with roughly 400,000thunderstorms. These lightning strikes “ring” the metaphorical bell of theearth’s ionosphere cavity creating the Schumann waves, a fundamental earth-basedpulsed electro-magnetic field of 7.83 Hz (along with higher harmonics mainly inthe 0-30Hz range).The Body ElectricThe human body is primarily an energy, or electrical being, and is secondarilychemical. Conventional and alternative medicine proves this. The ancients calledthis energy “Qi,” “Chi,” and “Prana.” Acupuncture and much of the ancienteastern Chinese and Japanese therapies are based on an understanding of theenergy fields of the body. The Indian system of the chakras and the nadis alsounderstand this idea.Modern terms for this energy include “Life-force,” “Aura,” “L-field,” “SOEF,”“Biophotonics,” “Orgone,” “The Body electric” and “Corona Discharge”. Here inthe west it is becoming overwhelmingly evident, thanks to modern technology,that yes, we are energetic. Conventional MRI’s, cat scans, EEG’s EKG’s EMG’sNCV’s and other new technologies are showing us that we are primarily energetic.As far back as 2750 BC electric eels were used by Egyptians to treat headachesand various mental illness. Reportedly Cleopatra slept on and wore a lodestoneto keep her skin youthful, and magnets have long been used in China with theancient art of acupuncture. The ancient greeks understood this and Plato andAristotle wrote extensively that many things cannot be identified with, orexplained in terms of, [the] physical body.Today, “Energy Medicine” is a new field of alternative medicine that uses energyinstead of chemistry to heal, these include the following: Pulsed electro-Magnetic Fields, RIFE machines, Radionnics, Zappers, Scenars, Cold Lasers,Infrared Therapy, Ionic Footbaths, Biofeedback Defices, Multiwave Oscillators,Gas Plasma, Scalar Energy Devices, Activated Air, Whole Body Vibration and more.Yuri Gagarin’s Historic FlightThe Russians won the space race with Yuri Gagarin’s historic flight around theearth, however he came back in bad shape. When he arrived back on earth he haddepression, bone loss, muscle degeneration (had to be carried out on astretcher) decreased metabolism, and impaired perception. He was only away fromthe earths pulsed-magnetic fields for a one hour, 48 minute flight around theearth!Since that historic flight, “Zero Field Studies” (experiments done in chambersmade of Mu Steel which blocks all magnetic fields of the earth) have confirmedthat if living cells do not receive the pulsed magnetic fields of the earth theydie within hours. We now use pulsed-magnetic generators in every space suit andin every space station because we have to! It is an essential element.Earth-based PEMF’s are required elements of health. You can live longer withoutfood, water and sleep then you can live without pulsating electro-magneticfields. Yuri Gagarin’s historic 108-minute trip was the first evidence thatPEMF’s are critical for life, without them we die, and with not enough we getSICK!Why Don’t We Get Heart Cancer?Why don’t we get heart cancer? Think about that for a minute. One interestingtheory is the heart is the most electrical organ. Heart cells have a voltage of120 millivolts (mV) and in some cases slightly higher. This is almost twice thevoltage of some of the other cells in the average person. PEMF acts as a whole-body battery charger by recharging EACH of the 100 trillions cells in the body.Though we can not charge the cells as high as the heart, we can raise thevoltage of the cells in our body up 70mV, and even 100 mV or more in the case ofhigh- end athletes. In most people you can get 70-90mV.PEMF acts like a spark, ignition, or impulse that keeps the cells charged at anideal voltage. Just like a car, the human body needs fuel, oxygen and ignition –a spark-plug. Within the human body that spark is pulsed magnetic fields. Allmetabolic processes are driven by this cellular charge: ATP production, oxygenand nutrient absorption, waste removal, defense and reproduction (ATP oradenosine triphosphate is the mainly currency of energy in the body).According to Nobel Prize Laureate, Dr. Otto Warburg, cells maintain a voltageacross their membrane, which is analogous to the voltage of a battery. He foundthat healthy cells have a measureable voltage from 70-100 millivolts, with theheart cells having the highest (upwards to 110 millivolts).Dr. Warburg found that due to the constant stress of modern life along with atoxic environment and the aging process, cellular voltage drops. A sick celllooses energy and there is not enough ATP. People with chronic illnesses andchronic fatigue unilaterally had a diminished cellular voltage (30-50millivolts). Cancer patients displayed the lowest voltage at less than 15-20millivolts. Cancer cells only have a voltage of 15-20mV and are in anaerobicrespiration (creating ATP without oxygen) and need ten times more energy fromthe environment.PEMF therapy enhances and improves the uptake, binding and absorption of oxygen,allows nutrients to be assimilated and delivered better. Earth-based PEMF alsoenhances your water-based blood and lymph so it has an ideal pH, voltage, lowersurface tension (viscosity), which enhances microcirculation so that essentialminerals, vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids, nutrients, water and oxygen aredelivered to cells, and absorbed by the cells. This gives cells all they need tocreate energy, mainly in the form of ATP and the cellular voltage across thecell membrane.NOW you can see why earth-based PEMF is literally a whole body batteryrecharger, capable of energizing and “charging-up” your 100 trillion cells withenergy and life!The 2-Fold Problem – Not enough of the Good andToo Much of the BadBut there is a problem when it comes to the earth’s natural geomagnetic fieldand Schumann resonances. The problem is two-fold: first we are simply notgetting enough of the good earth PEMF and magnetism due to a decline in theearth’s magnetic field and the growing trend of people spending time indoors inshielded structures (that partially block the earth’s fields). The secondproblem is the increasing exposure to unhealthy electrosmog from cell phones,power lines, cellphone towers, cordless phones, TV, computers, microwaves, hairdryers, Wi- Fi, Bluetooth, etc. To put it simply, we are getting not enough ofthe GOOD (earth PEMFs) and we are getting too much of the BAD (electrosmog,negative EMFs). We are unplugged from nature and plugged into artificialenergies from our modern world. To be healthy we need to reverse this trend andplug into nature and unplug as much as possible from unhealthy electrosmog.Remember that natural earth geomagnetic and Schumann frequencies are essential,just like food, water and oxygen. We just are not getting enough exposure to thelife nurturing and life enhancing pulsed magnetic energy of the earth. Butfortunately, like nutrient deficiencies, you CAN and SHOULD supplement your daywith an 8-minute session on an earth-based PEMF device.While we can always go outside and lay on the earth to get these frequencies,over the past 300 years the earths magnetic field has declined 50% and Manytheorize that we are in the process of a pole reversal over the next couplethousand years so the earth’s magnetic field and the essential PEMFs of theearth is most likely going to continue.The other problem is the average person stays inside 90% of the day. On top ofthat, we live and work in concrete structures; we drive in metal cars, and wearrubber soles as we walk on concrete. There are some Japanese researchers thatcall Fibromyalgia: “Magnetic Deficiency Syndrome.”Besides not getting enough of the “good” earth PEMFs, we are getting too muchunhealthy PEMF’s “electro smog”; from power lines, computers, cell phones,digital clocks, microwaves, T.V.’s, and hair dryers. These unhealthy PEMF’scause a “sub-molecular electronic disturbance.” This phrase was coined by aformer Nobel Prize winner to describe these unhealthy energies that bombard uson a daily basis.Because of this two-fold problem, it is going to become increasingly importantto supplement with a good earth-based PEMF device. And if you are still a littleskeptical, consider that PEMF therapy is one of the most well researched formsof natural healing.The ProcessMany of the initial studies have been carried out in Russia and Eastern Europe,but more and more research is now taking place in the United States. PEMF is anon-contact, non-invasive, non-pharmacological and effective treatment for manyconditions. Worldwide more than 2,000 double blind studies have demonstratedthat PEMF therapy is a safe and effective treatment for a variety of conditions,as well as to promote and maintain general cellular health and function.PEMF therapy has been used extensively for decades for many health issues, andresults can be seen in animals as well as humans. The National Institutes ofHealth have made PEMF therapy a priority for research. In fact, the FDA hasalready approved many PEMF devices, some specifically to fuse broken bones,wound healing, pain and tissue swelling, and also to treat depression. Mosttherapeutic PEMF devices are considered safe by various standards andorganizations.Just to be clear, PEMF therapy or any energy medicine device for that matterdoes not heal or cure disease. What it’s really doing is jump-starting ourbody’s own natural healing process. The body is self-healing, self-regulatingand self- regenerating. It has the natural ability to heal when given the properenergy and elements needed for sustaining life (more on the five essentialelements in the next chapter). In light of this, let’s look at the many“benefits” that PEMF therapy provides.Top 8 Benefits PEMF therapies will give YOU.(These benefits will allow you to experience a super-radiant and healthy life!)1. Stronger BonesOne of the first discoveries with PEMF therapy was the effect it had on healingand strengthening bones. A low frequency sawtooth PEMF signal has been shown tostimulate the osteoblast cells in the bones to produce bone matter.2. Endorphins and Pain ReliefIt’s been proven that earth’s PEMF is essential to creating endorphins (thebodies natural “opiates”) and additional endorphin synthesis can be promoted byPEMF therapy. This is one of the reasons why PEMF helps immediately withsymptomatic pain relief. Also PEMF generates microcurrents to run through theneural pathways, which reduces the signal needed to create the feeling orsensation of pain. Less signal = Less pain perception. So PEMF not only helps toincrease endorphins but it also directly decreases the triggering of the painresponse.3. Better Sleep and HGH secretionPulsing magnetic fields (especially the Schumann and geomagnetic frequency)stimulate the production of Melatonin in the pineal gland. Melatonin is one ofthe most important hormones for sleep and anti-aging. A good PEMF therapy systemhas a biorhythm clock which can directly improve sleep by entraining the mind tothe delta and theta frequencies (.5-7hz).4. More Energy ATPAt the most fundamental level, your body, organs, tissues and cells need energyto heal, period! No matter what your problem, disease, condition, or currentstate of health, if you give your body and cells more energy, YOU WILL getbetter and feel more vitality. We already discussed how PEMF therapy improvescellular voltage and ATP production, but it bears repeating.5. Better Oxygenation and CirculationThe primary function of the circulatory system is to deliver oxygen andnutrients TO THE CELLS and remove waste products FROM THE CELLS, to the organsof elimination. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems are intimatelyintertwined. Better respiration and circulation results in optimal ATP andenergy production. Research shows that pulsed magnetic therapy enhances thecardiovascular and respiratory system in delivering oxygen to the cells andremoving carbon dioxide and waste products .6. Improved ImmunityAnd there is direct research that PEMF improves immunity. Lymphocytes areimportant immune cells that protect our body from unwanted invaders. They havebeen found to proliferate in vitro in response to weak pulsing magnetic fields,thus improving overall immunity.7. Relaxation & Stress ReductionOne of the great benefits of PEMF therapy is that it assists the body inrelaxation, repair, and healing. It will shift your body into a moreparasympathetic mode if you are overstressed. It will energize, invigorate, andstimulate your body for optimal performance.8. Nerves and Tissue RegenerationOne important peer reviewed study showed that pulsed magnetic fields promote thegrowth of damaged nerves after traumatic injury. PEMF therapy helps to promotethe binding of nerve growth factor of the receptor proteins on the surface ofnerve cells, which facilitates regeneration.The Technique- The PEMF SolutionThe solution is earth-based PEMF devices. The IMRS made by Swiss BionicSolutions is the only PEMF devices that actually duplicate nature, both inintensity and frequency. It does this with a saw-tooth waveform which deliversbunches of the frequencies from 0-30Hz simultaneously. In eight minutes twiceper day all the bodies trillions of cells will be fully recharged andoxygenated. With a total of just sixteen minutes per day, the IMRS full-bodymatt gives the human body the energetic equivalent of walking barefoot in naturefor 2-4 hours!The applicator pad and probe uses the NASA-proven square wave that helps tobreak-up cycles of pain and allows the body to perform its own healing work.Additionally the IMRS is the only device that utilizes a biorhythm clock toensure the body receives energizing frequencies in the early part of the day,and relaxing and sleep frequencies in the evening.By using an earth-based PEMF system like the IMRS made by Swiss BionicSolutions, you give your body a safe and concentrated dose of natural earthfrequencies, which is the solution to the two-fold problem of the decline of theearth’s magnetic fields and the rise of unhealthy electrosmog. Plus, PEMFtherapy provides dozens of additional benefits such as more energy, bettersleep, pain reduction, healing and regeneration, better oxygenation and muchmore!Bryant Meyers, BS MA Physics, is a former physics professor, TV show host, andleading expert in the field of energy medicine and PEMF therapy. For overeighteen years, he has researched, tested, tried, and investigated well over$500,000 worth of energy medicine and frequency devices, studying with many ofthe world’s experts. During the past six years he has dedicated his life andresearch to PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) therapy, which he feels is thecrown jewel of energy medicine. He has also helped and personally assistedthousands of people in this exciting new field. Bryant currently lives inSarasota, Florida, near the beautiful Siesta Key Beach. www.pemfbook.com [http://www.pemfbook.com/] "},{"pageContent":" Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 1.03.58 pm.png [../images/00041.jpeg] FROM THE DESK OF HERMINA Hermina Danniel The most frequently asked questionsconcerning magnetic resonance stimulation.Our journey will guide us through many published observations as well as my ownexperience with PULSED MAGNETIC FIELD THERAPY (IMRS) and its users which I wasprivileged to witness over a period of 15 years+What does this stimulation do?The primary feature of this treatment method is the resonance effect ofpulsating electro-magnetic fields in the body. Vibrations or frequenciescorresponding with the frequencies of our own cells are transmitted aspurposeful information to unhealthy or energy deprived cells which function hasbeen restricted and disturbed. In other words, magnetic resonance stimulationincreases the body’s cell potential due to higher oxygen supply and acceleratesthe function of ion pumps due to increased ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate - energyor fuel for the cell)..What does resonance mean?Resonance is the principle of using precisely those oscillations with which acell in the body or the entire organism oscillates independently. So naturallythe original fundamental oscillation is amplified. The cell membrane oscillatesat a certain frequency and at a certain amplitude. Unhealthy cells have the samefrequency, however a different amplitude because of weaker oscillation. Atprecisely this point the resonance phenomenon of the magnetic field stimulationcomes into effect because the amplitude of the oscillation can be reinforced byresonance.What do I feel during therapy?Although magnetic fields cannot be felt with our senses, some users perceive acertain sensation during this treatment. The most common observation is a slightfeeling of heat on the parts being treated. This is a slight temperatureincrease due to improved circulation in the skin or the muscles. Tingling of thehands and feet is one of the sensations reported commonly. The occurrence of aslight increase in heartbeat is very rare and usually contributed to someanxiety and fear of what is going on. Preferably, one should perceive that ‘warmfuzzy’ feeling caused by deep relaxation due to a balanced autonomic nervoussystem. 39.png [../images/00042.jpeg] Are there any side effects or can I do too much therapy?Clinical studies on more than 200,000 patients have shown no side-effectsdetrimental to health due to magnetic resonance stimulation.15 to 20% of users experience a first reaction similar to a spa reaction.It may also be considered a ‘healing reaction’ which can occur by slightlyincreased pain. Usually these people are sensitive to magnetic fields ingeneral, also to weather changes.On the average the duration of first reactions is between two and four weeks.To experience it as a single event is not uncommon either. It is important thatusers are informed ahead of time not to be discouraged to continue the treatmentsimply out of fear.More water intake can help in case of adverse reaction or reducing time orintensities at the beginning of treatment.THERE IS NO OVERSTIMULATION POSSIBLE. Needless to say, staying within therecommended intensities should be stressed to achieve optimal results.The user, however, needs to be informed that the whole body application shouldnot exceed one hour during one day. (Recommendation by the World HealthOrganization)How do I know that it helps me?‘Simply lay on it for at least four weeks and allow yourself to enter the highsuccess rate statistics which is available. Trust your body’s ability toregulate itself when given the right tool’, could be one answer to thisquestion.29 years of scientific research on magnetic resonance stimulation, and over 6500scientific publications have already proven the medical effect of pulsatingelectromagnetic fields. Double blind studies and clinical observations can claima higher success rate using this treatment method than can many drugs.How can the effect of magnetic resonance stimulation be verified?• The most valuable verification is the user’s personal perception before andafter• MRS application.• Clinical documented case histories• Dark field microscopy and thermography before and after treatment• Observation of daily life activity (improved energy and stamina)• Mobility test - finger-floor distance test - muscle measurement testHow long does it take for the magnetic field to act?The onset of effect varies from person to person. It is determined by the body’sreactivity and various influences. High doses of medication, internal scartissue, dehydration or the body’s acidity level may also play a role, needlessto say, smoking.A young person will react more quickly than an older person. In addition, thetype of complaint and its cause need to be taken into consideration, as well asthe duration and the damage, which has already occurred in the body.In treatment of pain, relief occurs on the average after four to eight weeks. Ifthis is not the case, above mentioned influences may have to be examined.Important: Magnetic resonance stimulation is a regulatory procedure inaccordance with the body’s own reactivity. The longer a painful condition hasalready existed, the longer it will take to improve. However, the immediateeffect as explained prior is occurring during the first and all applicationseven though the user is not aware of it. Numerous testimonials share unexpectedand sudden wonderful ‘side effects’ while applying the MRS regularly.What can be done if the effect does not last?Variations in success of the treatment are observed in patients with chroniccomplaints. This situation could be re-examined by adjusting the dose or byadding additional remedies. For instance vitamins or herbal supplements.In many cases, a declining effect is due to careless use with a treatment timethat is too short or not continuing over a longer period of time. Sometimesbecause of the euphoria about the initial success, users forget to consistentlymaintain their changes of a better lifestyle or diet. Even magnetic resonancestimulation cannot help undo the negative effects of continued poor habits.(Never forget to exercise and to walk: ‘These boots are made for walking’!-Nancy Sinatra)What is the actual role of the Chinese Organ Clock?According to the Chinese Organ Clock, organs have their peak function atdifferent times within 24 hours. Every two hours a different organ becomes veryactive energetically for approximately two hours. It is not necessary for us toapply the MRS at a certain organ time. Thanks to innovative technology the MRS2000 and IMRS use these biological daily rhythms in all its time settings.Why does the polarity change from North to South?The polarity of a magnetic field plays a crucial role and changes every twominutes. Different structures in the human and animal body have a certainpolarity preference. Applying magnetic resonance stimulation, organs are treatedaccording to their preference.For instance:North pole flow seems to have a positive effect on pain, swelling, acidificationof tissue, sleep disorders and agitation. South pole flow should result inimproved metabolism, better circulation, faster wound healing and generalregeneration of the body.Why is this treatment method not recommended by doctors?Energy medicine is not part of the regular university medical curriculum.Many patients ask their physicians about their opinion regarding magneticresonance stimulation only to find out that they have never heard of it.Nevertheless, many MDs have taken time by now to study this treatment method,especially in europe, and are incorporating it as supportive measure into theirown treatments. In addition several european Universities offer lecturesrelative to magnetic field stimulation and have provided their own double blindstudies of which many have been published.The Biggest Misconception About The MRS 2000/IMRSThe term ‘magnetic resonance stimulation’ may suggest to potential users thatthere must be magnets placed in our whole body applicator. Some may even searchfor them, while in fact, we are only creating an electro magnetic field withinthe same frequency range of mother earth and the frequencies of our cells.Static magnets are not able to achieve a resonance effect. Neither should theMRS stimulation be compared with other so-called ‘Magnetic Field Therapies’which operate with much higher frequencies.Pulsed Magnetic Resonance Stimulation is altogether different and scientificallyproven most effective.Hermina Danneil is a PEMF Expert for low frequency MRS devices with fourteenyears theoretical and practical experience. She is fluent in German and English.Hermina has served as an International Promoter for over twenty years,exchanging cultural, educational, economical and medical programs between the USand Germany. In this capacity, she received numerous international awards.Hermina obtained her diploma in energy medicine (pulsed magnetic field therapy)and ten individual MRS certificates during a four and half year educationalperiod in Europe under the guidance of renowned MRS scientists and doctors:• Dr. med.

Tuli The EssenceIn a battle that happened 50 centuries ago, an arrow hit a warrior in his leg.As the arrow was removed and the wound was being attended to, it was noticedthat his frozen shoulder got healed this attracted the attention of hisphysicians to the relationship between the point punctured and the disease itcured in a distant part of the body.Chinese monarchy patronized the system of acupuncture. Over the years a causeand effect relationship was worked out by the physicians of the era between thepoint punctured and the disease it cured. All such points were charted out onthe human body. The joining together of these points termed acupuncture points,with similar physiological and therapeutic properties led to the development ofwhat is now known as the system of acupuncture meridians of channels.The word “Acupuncture” is derived from Latin words “acus”and “punctate”, meaninga “needle” and to penetrate respectively. It is recorded to be nearly 5000 yearsold system of Traditional Chinese Medicine (T.C.M.) in which hair fine sterileneedles are inserted at acupuncture points on the skin to rectify the flow oflife-force energy (chi) and restore the yin yang balance or the homoeostasis.This phenomenon augments the body’s own inherent natural healing energy thatcures most of the acute chronic and even conventionally incurable diseases.In well-trained and experienced hands acupuncture is a complete system of healthby itself. Its efficacy improves tremendously when a qualified physiciandedicated to acupuncture practices it. It is best used in the cure of commonlyincurable diseases like migraine, insomnia, mental disorders, sinusitis, asthma,indigestion arthritis and spondylitis, etc. It may be unbelievable but it’s truethat acupuncture cures the incurables in expert hands.Acupuncture is highly effective at all the levels of health:• Promotion of health i.e. to improve the health of the healthy; many sportsmenare using acupuncture during their training to enhance their performance.• Prevention of sickness: The ancient Chinese paid their physician as long asthey were healthy, and stopped his dues when they fell sick!• Early diagnosis and cure: Traditional observation of the pulse or tonguehelped to diagnose sickness well before it manifested physically, enabling anearly cure.• Supplementing acupuncture with the knowledge and diagnostics of modernmedicine helps to cure any sickness much quicker, thereby minimizing/eliminatingthe adverse effects of prolonged sickness or medication.• Disability limitations: Timely diagnosis and effective cures limits the aftereffects or residual disability of sickness.• Rehabilitations: Acupuncture has been found to be excellent in the relief ofmost of the chronic incurable diseases and restoration of the individual to astate of positive health.Usually Acupuncture cures acute ailments almost instantly, and chronic ailmentsfaster than any other system usually in a matter of weeks. It can be describedto be very time efficient. It should be started right at the onset of anysickness.Acupuncture is equally effective at all ages: in the infants, children youngadults and the elderly. In fact, the old people are amazed at its efficacy, asthey don’t have to live any longer with ailments related to their age.Acupuncture and AcupressureAcupressure is an art based on the science of acupuncture where a simpleknowledge of the meridians and reflex points imparted to a paramedical worker, amasseur or even a lay person is used by applying pressure on them for energizingthe chi for first aid or relief of minor ailments.Current status of acupuncture in the worldIn People’s Republic of china (P.R.C) the country’s primary health care is basedupon the T.C.M. It also supplements all the centers of modern medicine providingsecondary and tertiary care. This model has proved its tremendous success aswithin its limited resources the P.R.C has achieved a health status comparablewith the best in the world.After exhaustive scientific evaluation over 25 years, the world healthorganization (W.H.O.) has given recognition to acupuncture. The Food & DrugAgency (F.D.A.) and the National Institute of Health (N.I.H.) in U.S.A. havingendorsed its scientific basis the various states in U.S.A. offer licenses to itspractitioners. In U.K. the National Health Services (N.H.S.) recognizes and paysfor acupuncture.The ProcessTraditionally it involves insertion of special hair fine sterile needles atprescribed acupuncture points to regulate the flow of chi in the body and bringcure. There is also a method called non-invasive or needle- free Acupuncture.It’s the form of acupuncture where penetrating needles are not used. Thismodality may be preferred in young children, frail and the elderly, for cosmeticuse or when the recipient is afraid of needles. Some of the non-invasivemodalities are, however, always used as supplements to the main therapy.LimitationsLike all other systems, acupuncture would have its inherent limitations in notbeing able to cure all the patients. A patient in medical emergency needing lifesaving resuscitations, urgent surgery, serious infection, any life-threateningcondition or a mechanical problem must be first directed to a medical facility.Acupuncture in such conditions would normally be a useful supplement in speedingup the recovery, final outcome of the sickness, and curing the residual\\ chroniccomponent of the sickness.The most important of all is that the practitioner must be competent and knowhis limitations as not to waste precious time vital for patient’s recovery.Disorders Treated by Acupuncture• Orthopedics: Myalgia fasciitis, periathritis spondylitis, spinal & disclesions, radiculopathy, osteon & Rhtd.

Etc.The TipAcupuncture being a natural therapy saves one from the side effects and toxicityof drugs. It complements all other systems of therapy. The greatest advantage isthat acupuncture cures most of the diseases permanently and activates positivewellbeing of the body mind and spirit.Acupuncture is a highly efficient cost effective & truly holistic (body-mind-spirit) natural modality for the cure of acute & chronic ailments, especiallyeffective in most of the conventionally incurable disorders. It is highly usefulfor all specialties.Its efficacy becomes much higher in combinations with other life-forcemanagement therapies like yoga, pranayama, meditation, reiki, pranic- healingetc.Dr. Ravi.

I was working in gulf from where Ireturned to India, not able to fully cope up with the challenges of my work, myhealth started failing. I became seriously sick and every day I struggled withloose motions and bleeding. I actually lost count of my visits to the toilet,and this continued for 6 months until I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis bya gastroenterologist. I was put on steroids and other medications, instructednot to stop them until advised (Steroids were to be tapered off gradually). Aslight recovery and I would opt to stop my medication and my Colitis wouldrelapse, in & out of many hospitals under different specialists, I struggledendlessly with same medication and no lasting relief or effect.I tried different methods for healing as well, however my suffering was not toend so easily and thus I suffered for 13 long years during which I gave up myjob and started working as a civil contractor, which allowed me to remain homeon days when I would be unwell. In the year 1999 I read a newspaper articleabout a combination of certain alternative therapies, with a faint hope I triedit and this time it worked. My health improved substantially in just 6 months.This incident changed my life path altogether and I discovered a new passion,that of helping people end their physical suffering through these therapies.Today I am living an inspired and contended life. I am healthy and thriving inmy work and I am glad to share with you more insights about two such therapies.SUJOK Therapy was first developed by Prof. Park Jae woo from South Korea inlater part of 20th century. It works on the principle that the human body is aform of well-harmonized universe. The body innately has everything needed tomaintain itself to its optimum. And indeed this has been proved true as wewitness healing miracles every day.Sujok in Korean language means ‘Hand & Foot’. “SU” means a hand & “JOK” means afoot. It is expressed in ancient healing systems that our hands and feetresemble our body structure and certain points on hands and feet when stimulatedhave a direct effect on the related organ. Stimulation of these points producesan evident treatment and prophylactic effect. These points are arranged on thehands & feet in an anatomic structure of the organism. The body and itscorresponding areas interact continuously and when this knowledge is applied inthe form of a technique like Sujok or Acupressure the energy meridians of thebody are cleared which then helps in resuming the flow of vital energy. As themalfunctioning organ starts receiving the vital energy once again, we see ashift in the functioning of the organ and a consequent relief from disease.When we are not sick we might not need intensive therapy however good physicalactivity like walking, running, household work, dance etc. are the best ways tokeep these vital points stimulated which can help us maintain good healthnaturally. However when our health is compromised we can always consider Sujokas accessible and effective method of improving our health, getting fast &markedly curative results. In Sujok it is important that the correspondingpoints are correctly and regularly stimulated using various appropriate methods,this ensures that we get the desired effect. In some cases we have seen resultswithin a few minutes of proper treatment.When the natural stimulation of the correspondence system/points and areasbecomes inadequate, a person falls ill. In such cases, accurately appliedstimulation of points usually proves quite effective. Methods of effectivestimulation include Micro needles, Pressure, Electro Stimulation, Colors,Different edible seeds, Star magnets, and Natural minerals, to mention a few. Atour holistic healing centre in Mumbai, we offer Sujok therapy not in isolationrather we give it in combination with certain therapies that further enhance theeffectiveness of the therapy and the patients get faster and lasting results.Sujok has been found to be effective in diseases like Kidney/Liver failure, Highor Low Blood Pressure, Coma, Diabetes, Spinal Disorders, Scaloderma, ENTproblems, Nervous Disorders, Stress & Depression, Hormonal Imbalance, Vertigo,Heart Problems, Skin Problems etc.Other than Sujok Acupressure is also very effective and simple to administer.Acupressure has been in India and China for thousands of years. The principlesapplied in acupressure are same as that of acupuncture but no needles are usedand stimulation is achieved by applying pressure through fingers. Other bodyworktherapies of Asian origin are medical Qigong, Tuina, Shiatsu (Japanese form ofacupressure), and hand and foot therapies from Korea, Body and Foot manipulation(both dry and wet) from Thailand etc.The ProcessThese healing methods are based on the knowledge of special acu-points/locationsor acupressure points that lie along meridians/channels/pathways in our body,which are also present in all higher animals as well. It is said that, throughthese invisible channels flows vital energy or life force at a fixed timing fora specific period before shifting to another energy channel at a 2-hourinterval. These 12 major meridians connect specific organs or network of organs,thus organizing a system of transfer of energy throughout our body. The channelsbegin at various locations and follow various paths to connect to an organassociated with a certain meridian. Illness happens whenever any of thesemeridians are blocked or are out of balance. Acupressure and Acupuncture areamong many type of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) that helps to restorebalance of this energy network in our body, which leads to healing and recovery.Acupressure practitioners use fingers, palms, elbows/feet, or special devices toapply pressure at acupoints/areas and reflection points on palm and feet.Sometimes, acupressure also involves stretching or acupressure massage, as wellas other methods for stimulating the points and releasing the blockages. Duringthe session that lasts between 30 min to 1 hour, the therapist gently pressesthe points/locations specific to the organs/parts of the body that are affected.Ancient Indian texts also mention application of a method called ‘Shingi’ whichincludes treatment on specific body locations. In this method, the traditionalhealers create vacuum using hollow horn shells and draw out blood. In modernmethod this is known as bloodletting, instead of horn shells nowadays plasticvacuum disposable cups are available. Bloodletting has therapeutic benefits andwhen this technique is well applied gives good relief and result in a wide rangeof ailments.The main goal of Sujok, acupressure or other types of body work therapies is tohelp restore health and balance to the channels of vital force and to helpregulate the opposing forces of yin and yang. Apart from physical well beingmany times these therapies also help restore peace of mind and brings harmony tothe spirit. I would like to share few unique cases where our integrated therapybrought miraculous results for the patients.A 52-year-old man was suffering for 22 years with epileptic fits, which occurredon the 26th of every month and he had to take 3 tablets a day. His seizure wouldlast for 6 to 8 hours and he would lose consciousness. After we administered ouralternative therapy including Sujok, his medication was reduced to 2 tablets aday and his fits entirely stopped. At present if he feels a seizure happening itonly lasts for 10 -15 minutes after which he is able to resume his work.A 45-year-old man from Mumbai had ulcerative colitis and he was on medicationfor past 5 years, which included taking 6 tablets a day along with steroids.Despite the medication he suffered from loose stools with blood and mucussometimes 10 times a day. After he consulted us, we offered him integratedalternate therapy, now after two years he is off medications and he is able totake normal diet and his condition is very stable.Another inspiring story is that of a 65-year-old lady from Mumbai who wassuffering from knee joint arthritis. She had difficulty in sitting on the flooror folding her legs and she could not even walk without a stick. She was advisedto go for a knee replacement surgery however her family was reluctant due topossibility of complications. They approached us and within one year’s timethere was no pain in her knees. Her surgery was cancelled and she can now walkpain free.We also witnessed another case of healing where a 40-year-old woman fromAhmedabad who had severe pain and numbness in arms for more than 8 years wascompletely healed within 1 month of treatment. Her MRI report had shown multipleproblems like Cervical Spondylitis, Osteophytes from full cervical and fulllumbar to base of spine, however a simple approach of alternative therapy workedwonders for her and she was cured within 30 days.Another case is that of a 42-year-old man from New Delhi who fell down fromstairs and had tailbone injury. He opted for many treatments like allopathicmedications, physiotherapy and chiropractic treatment for almost 4 months.However he had no relief and ultimately he came to our centre and we started histreatment. Within 2 months his pain was 50% reduced and within few months herecovered 90%. He is very happy and as his treatment continues he is on his wayto full recovery.One more inspiring case is that of an autistic child who came to us when he wasjust 7 years old. He could hardly speak and had no response to commands. Withinfour months of treatment he started forming sentences and he was responding tohis parents. His hyperactivity was also reduced.Every day we are thrilled to witness new stories of healing and recoveryhappening at our centre. The contentment and joy it brings is priceless. Besidesthe cases we shared here, we had patients with severe diabetes, spinal problems,rheumatoid arthritis, PCOD etc. and all of them recovered very well from theirpainful conditions.The TipFrom my experience I have concluded that in any case a combination ofalternative therapies always works better rather than the patient trying varioustherapies in isolation one after another. Sustained effort and positive attitudefrom patient’s side are also important factors that influence the effectivenessof the treatment. In many cases the Dimension of Space (Vaastu) is also includedto help faster recovery.Life is a journey and like any journey it also has its risks and many times wefall prey to the pitfalls of ignorance. In that, we damage our mind stream, ourconsciousness which leads to the imbalance of energy in the physical body aswell. Any injury or diseases is only a reflection of our imbalance within. Thetherapies whether focusing on mind or body help us restore our lost balance andwhen that is achieved healing is the spontaneous consequence.The realization of this simple process can end our futile search for complexremedies. Nature is simple and so is our body, and it knows how to keep itselfhealthy and efficient. Only a faulty intervention is what causes suffering whichcan happen through bad diet and lifestyle, wrong and negative thinking,disempowering beliefs and lack of self-love and self-esteem.If we learn to cultivate a healthy lifestyle, we will not require any intensivehealth care throughout our life. Even in severe cases natural therapies haveproved their effectiveness beyond any doubt. It is only our own willingness toadopt them that is needed.My vision is to spread the message about this integrated approach of alternativetherapy. Millions of people are dying every year due to physical suffering,which can be easily eliminated. Today more than high end drugs and complextreatments we need a holistic approach and an army of healers that do the workrequired.“Without health life is not life; it is only a state of langour and suffering -an image of death.” - BuddhaLet us nurture a healthy state of body and mind and be ALIVE.Amarjit Singh Narula is a civil enginner turned holistic healer having more thana decade of experience in alternative therapies, he regularly offers seminarsand workshops on Sujok and Acupressure, Bach Flower Therapy and other methods aswell. He has been appointed as a lecturer in Sujok Therapy, Twist Therapy &Smile meditation. He travels extensively to teach and spread awareness about theneed and scope of Alternative Healing. He also hosts a daily holistic show onAastha Channel at 00.40 hrs.

Sibia Invasive and surgical treatments should be preserved forpatients with crippling disease where other ‘peaceful’non-invasive treatments have failed.The EssenceMaintaining health is more effective and less expensive than trying to regainit. However when disease does occur, mankind has always searched for easy homeremedies and when they fail patients submit themselves to the physician formedication. Invasive and surgical means are the last choice of the patient’seven if the patient is a doctor himself. External Counter Pulsation (ECP) is onesuch truly non-pharmaceutical program designed to help cardiac patient recover,heal and enjoy an enhanced quality of life besides offering many other benefitssafely and effectively. ECP can be life saving for patients who generally havelittle that medical science could offer till now.ProcedureExternal Counter Pulsation therapy or ECP, also known as EECP is a procedureperformed on patients with angina or heart failure in order to diminish theirsymptoms ischemia, improve functional capacity and quality of life. In variousstudies, ECP has been shown to relieve angina, and decrease the degree ofischemia in a cardiac stress test. The procedure of the treatment is quitesimple. ECP is an outpatient treatment and the patient lies on a comfortablebed. While undergoing ECP, large blood pressure-like pneumatic cuffs are wrappedaround the legs and arms are connected to an air compressor preferably havingprovision for both positive and negative pressure. At the same time electrodesand sensors are attached to continuously monitor heart rate and rhythm and aspecial sensor applied to the finger or ear lobe checks the oxygen level in theblood and monitors the pressure waves created by the cuff inflations anddeflations.The cuffs are timed to inflate and deflate based on the individual’selectrocardiogram at specific times between two heartbeats i.e. mid-diastolicphase when the heart is at rest and getting its own blood and oxygen supply. Thecuffs should ideally inflate at the beginning of diastole and deflate justbefore the next heart beat. During the inflation portion of the cycle, the calfand arm cuffs inflate first, then the lower thigh cuffs and finally the upperthigh cuffs. Inflation is controlled by a pressure monitor, and the cuffs areinflated to about 200 mmHg.The treatment is usually one hour at a time, once or twice a day, 5 to 7 days aweek for 35 or more treatment sessions.MechanismWhen timed correctly, this will decrease the after-load that the heart has topump against, and increase the preload that fills the heart thus increasing thecardiac output. By increasing the pressure in the aorta while the heart isrelaxing (during diastole) ECP increases blood flow into the heart’s arteries.Various mechanisms of action find mention in the research papers.Repeated dilatation of the arteries has the effect of stretching a rubber bandrepeatedly till it looses some of its elasticity and remains permanentlydilated. The ECP relaxed arteries improve circulation.The repeated increase in pressure stress in the coronary circulation results inthe release of Nitric Oxide and various growth factors.Nitric oxide is a vasodilator that opens and relaxes arteries, contributes toless arterial stiffness, improved function of endothelial cells and thus helpimprove circulation. oxideThe Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a hormone that helps stimulateangiogenesis, the growth of new collaterals for blood flow around blockages,like a naturally created bypass thus ECP helps grow new arteries naturally andimproves arterial function.Recent research has demonstrated that ECP is also a regenerative therapy. Itenhances release released into circulation Stem cells (Progenitor andHematopoietic cells) found in bone marrow, the endothelium (lining of thearteries) and organ tissue to help regeneration of damaged tissues.The increased oxygenated and nutrient rich blood flow revives tissue in heartand body that have restricted or blocked blood flow and the mechanical externalcardiac assistance provided by ECP results in improvement in energy and exercisetolerance.ECP also improves blood flow to the brain, lymphatic circulation and enhancesquality of life (less fatigue, better sleep, more stamina, longer exerciseduration, reduced stress, passive exercise benefit as from one hour ofaerobics). It is expected to improve longevity with anti-aging effects,decreases anxiety and depression besides antioxidant and detoxification effectsThirty five ECP treatment sessions increases blood flow to the heart myocardium(muscle) by 20-42% and the effect lasts for three to nine years. However thissafe and comfortable treatment can be repeated earlier for enhancement inresults.IndicationsThe no medication, safe, FDA cleared ECP is approved by many insurance companiesand has a significant role and can be life saving in heart patients who have noother treatment options. Some patients who can be benefitted are:• Patients with severe, diffuse coronary atherosclerosis and persistent angina,shortness of breath or significant silent ischemia burden, such as elderlypatients and those with diabetes, challenging coronary anatomies, ordebilitating heart failure, renal failure, or pulmonary disease.• ECP Therapy has also been shown to be effective in relieving angina symptomsin patients with Cardiac Syndrome X.• Benefits of ECP have been determined in the management of angina in theelderly and in patients with mild refractory angina.• ECP Therapy is equally effective in reducing angina symptoms in patients withor without diabetes, and in patients with all ranges of body mass index/obesity.• Who have already had angioplasty, stents, or bypass surgery, but their heartdisease symptoms have returned or persisted.• Are not candidates for surgery due to other medical conditions• Do not want to undergo surgery• Are diabetic, asthmatics, have kidney or other problems making them unfit orhigh risk for other treatment.• Have small vessels – more common in diabetics and in women.• Rely on medications or curtail their activities to avoid angina• Peripheral artery disease and Leg pain• Erectile Dysfunction• Stroke• Sports Enhancement to enhance exercise duration and increased stamina• Renal Failure• FatiguePatients who may be benefitted are those diagnosed to have coronary heartdisease. Patients who have Chest Pain, Shortness of Breath, Pain in the Jaw/Shoulder/ Arm/ Back or above the Stomach, Palpitation, Heavy Sweating, FaintingSpells on walking or climbing stairs at a normal pace, while performing dailyactivities such as household chores/ shopping or leisure, after eating or justwatching television should have themselves evaluated by a doctor as these maysignify underlying heart disease. Some patients may get these features even atrest or are awaken at night with these symptoms.ContraindicationsECP therapy systems should not be used for treating patients with significantleaking aortic valve, irregular heart beat, bleeding disorders, aortic aneurysm,uncontrolled blood pressure and Pregnancy. Patients with blood pressure higherthan 180/110 mmHg or heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute should becontrolled prior to treatment. Age, pacemaker, obesity, diabetes, thyroid orother problems is no bar for ECP treatment.ImprovementImprovement can be seen and tested. The patients feels the improvement and testscan document the changes,Approximately 80% of patients who complete the 35-hour course of ECP Therapyexperience significant symptom relief that may last up to three to nine years.Patients have decreased symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, chronicfatigue, tiredness as well as a significant improvement in exercise toleranceand energy. They can walk longer distance and faster more comfortably.Medication is reduced in almost all patients.Stress Thallium shows increased myocardial blood flow. The new non-invasiveCardiovascular Cartography Hemodynamic study maps takes less than 30 minutes tograph improved blood flow to different regions, Oxygen demand reserve ratio andarterial compliance and decreased myocardial burden.ECP Therapy continues to demonstrate a reduction in hospital admission andre-admission rates in patients with chronic Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) andpatients with Congestive Heart Failure.ReferencesECP now finds reference in leading medical text books and journals. Numerouspresentations have been made in major scientific conferences, reporting resultsof clinical studies. Harrison’s principles of Interna.Medicine mentions “ECPutilizes pneumatic cuffs on the lower extremities to provide diastolicaugmentation and systolic unloading of blood pressure in order to decreasecardiac work and oxygen consumption while enhancing coronary blood flow. Recenttrials have shown that regular application improves angina, exercise capacity,and regional myocardial perfusion.” where as Braunwald’s text book ofCardiovascular Medicine writes “external counter pulsation is another promisingalternative treatment of refractory angina. Data suggest that ECP reduces thefrequency of angina and the use of nitroglycerin and improves exercise toleranceand quality of life. In a randomized, double-blind, sham – controlled study ofECP for patients with chronic stable angina, counter pulsation was associatedwith an increase in time to ST segment depression during exercise testing and areduction in angina. It also reduced the extent of ischemia detected withmyocardial perfusion imaging.”Future of ECPECP is now available worldwide, There are more than 900 academic institutionsand physicians who provide ECP therapy in the U.S. alone, including manyrenowned centres such as Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Medical Center, University ofNew York at Stony Brook, Cleveland Clinic, University of California, Universityof Pittsburgh Medical Center, etcStill, ECP Therapy is still underutilized worldwide. More than 75% of all anginapatients remain unaware of external Counter pulsation Therapy with less than 5%of cardiology clinics offering treatment for their patients. ECP has greatgrowth potential due to its safe, effective, non-surgical option with asubstantially lower cost.As current healthcare trends are aggressively evolving towards low cost, non-invasive solutions hence ECP therapy is a hot topic in Cardiology.Dr. S.S.

The answer to that question depends very muchon whom you ask it to. To a geologist, crystals of all shapes and sizes revealastounding Atomic symmetry. A Jeweler will tell you the most desirable crystalsare gemstones used to make expensive jewelry. To a Historian crystals are ameans to interpreting our cultural heritage finds from the graves of royalty aswell as artifacts unearthed from ancient dwellings reveal the changingdesirability of gemstones since antiquity.Priests, shamans and holy men have used them down the ages to help heal bodymind and soul. They have been used as weapons, tools, objects of divination injewelry, as talismans and amulets. They have been worn by emperors, rulers andpopes to symbolize authority, spirituality or union. Crowns were set withprecious stones, both for their beauty and for the crystal energies to enhanceand prove their importance. Pope Clement the 7th in the late 16th century isreputed to have ingested a gem concoction worth 40000 ducats equivalent to morethan 3 million $ today in order to heal, harmonize and empower himself. Down theages rubies were worn in the navel by belly dancers to excite passion. Egyptiansused malachite for healing and protection. The Incas used emerald; The Azteksused obsidian; the Chinese used jade; Tibetans and native-Americans used bothturquoise and smoky quartz; the Celts used Shale Amber.Ayurvedic and tantric scholars from India knew the amazing potential of preciousstones and used them with Vedic astrology; they used emeralds, diamonds, rubies,sapphires for their physiochemical and electromagnetic properties. In Atlantisthey were used to power entire cities. The mighty pyramids that still stand inall their glory are said to have been built with the help of huge crystals.Today, Crystals play a vital role in technology, from laser tipped drills,silicon chips in computer chips, credit cards, smart cards, lasers and theprograms of domestic appliances and quartz watches.The ProcessCrystals are natural rocks and minerals born deep within the womb of motherearth. They are mineral and solid substances created during the formativecooling stages of earth’s development some 5 billion years ago and they havecontinued to metamorphose as the planet itself changed. They are miniaturestorehouses containing the records of the earth over millions of years andbearing the indelible memory of the powerful forces that shaped it. Some havebeen subjected to enormous pressure, others grew in chambers deep underground inlayer and others dripped into being, all of which affects the properties of thecrystal and the way that they function. These crystals all have some amazinghealing properties and are increasingly being used across the globe to heal,balance and harmonize our energies.How Crystals WorkTo understand Crystals we first need to understand who we are. Human beings arebasically a mass of pulsating energy. We are actually beings of Light. We have 7different energy bodies. We have a mental energy body, an emotional energy body,an etheric energy body, an astral body and a physical body. The physical body isthe one we can see because it is the densest form of energy, but that too is anenergy body. All these energy bodies are constantly interfacing with each otherand impacting each other in a negative or positive way. All the energy bodiesflow through each other through our chakras, which are vortexes of energyspinning at different centers. We are nothing but energy vibrating at differentfrequencies, and all energy has a physical as well as a metaphysical aspect toit.Each Chakra is a certain color, is positioned in front of an endocrine gland andhas to do with a certain psychological aspect of our lives. Each color infusesthe appropriate soul center with power and vitality. So we are also nothing butdifferent colors vibrating at different frequencies. When this energy is in astate of free flow we will be in a state of Health and when there are blocks,these could be in your mental or emotional energy bodies; we end up in a stateof depletion or excess of a particular energy in a certain chakra. This createsan imbalance of energy and eventually it leads to a physical disease. Disease issimply a lack of ease in your auric and energy body which when it gets out ofhand manifests as a disease in your physical body. To heal a disease you have toheal the aura and crystals act at the etheric level.Properties of CrystalsCrystals are manifested forms of light and color. They vibrate at a certainfrequency, each resonating with certain chakra and emitting a sonic frequency.This is the music of the crystals, which can be heard by clairvoyants.Crystals are PIESO-ELECTRIC, which means when you apply mechanical pressure to acrystal it produces electricity, notably the quartz family and if you apply anelectric current to a crystal it will move mechanically, i.e. it oscillates.Crystals also have Morphic resonance. Medicines that we ingest are made based onBio Chemistry and Biochemistry is underpinned by electromagnetism. We areelectromagnetic beings. As we are beings of energy in a constant state ofvibration, we absorb the vibrations emitted by different crystals easily at anauric level and the aura will absorb just as much as it needs to. So the energyfield of the crystals is actually the energy field of the soul. Working with theenergy field of the soul is the highest form of intervention that you canreceive, because it is the most efficient way to identify and eliminate the rootcauses of both the psychological and physical illness.Crystals can increase the vibrational frequency of a room, and change thefrequency of your body and environment. In fact they can reach as far down asyour cellular DNA because everything and all matter is vibrating energy.The ability of crystals to focus energy means they can be used for specifictasks such as directing energy to a specific point on the body or to anemotional blockage .The disease is then gently dissolved and any imbalancecorrected. From hurt, grief, trauma, anxiety, to migraines, thyroid problems,kidney stones, back pain to name just a few I have been the happy witness tomany magical moments with crystals. Each time a healing happens it feels likemagic, and magical it is in the gentle ease and joy with which crystals help usheal. In fact mostly the shifts are so subtle with the healing that half thetime one may not even be aware but then one day one realizes that one hasactually become much better and one’s condition is greatly improved.Crystals can enhance meditation, deepening attunement with universal energies.They aid manifestation and offer protection. Crystals are all basicallyAlchemists, in that they catch negative energy, transform and transmute it intopositive, and in so doing they bring you into a state of wellness and wellbeingwith peace of mind, happiness and good health.The TechniqueCarrying crystals as protective amulets or wearing them as jewelry are thesimplest ways to utilize their natural potential. They can also be placed inyour rooms, with specific grids to enhance the vastu and fengshui of a space.Gem elixirs are another easy way of utilizing their healing potential.No matter what healing modality one is involved with, using Crystals alongsidecan enhance and empower the whole experience. Throughout the world, now crystalsare being used to heal. Medical and scientific reports confirm that crystalshave healing properties.Different crystals resonate with different chakras and specific crystals willwork for specific problems. There is a method of correct usage, which involvesnot just the correct diagnosis and recommendation, but a process of cleansing,programming, attunement and connection all of which contribute to maximumefficacy and healing.Some Successful Stories• A young man of 27 comes to me saying he has a really bad back problem and thedoctors have said he will never be able to gym again. Three healing sessionswith regular use of the crystals each day and at the end of the month, he isfeeling much better and by six weeks is back in the gym. That was 2 years agoand he tells me he is still doing fine.• Another young boy was in hospital in the ICU with a bad case of jaundice. Hisparameters were sinking and the doctors were skeptical of his chances ofrecovery. I got a frantic call from his mother and sent across some largecrystals to be placed next to him .The doctors couldn’t understand what turnedbut 36 hours later he was better, out of the ICU and within a week out ofhospital. Today he is a healthy strapping young man leading a full life. What isinteresting to note is that his mother told me one of the crystals I had sentacross turned completely yellow in the ICU as the boy simultaneously got better.Coincidence? I very much doubt it.• The mother of a school boy came to me saying her son was in a lot of pain dueto Kidney stones but being in boarding school and in class 10th nearing examsshe couldn’t bring him home. I gave her 2 crystals and told her how he must usethem saying, “lets see where it goes”. Three and a half weeks later, the boy isback home, goes in for an MRI and the doctor says, “what stones? It’s like sandout there”. What happened? I don’t try to decipher it.I am just happy he isbetter.• A young girl who happens to be my son’s friend was upset because her old doghas lost the use of his hind legs, could not move much, was in pain and the vethad advised it may be a good idea to let him go and put him to sleep. My soncalls me as I am out of town. I direct him as to which crystal to give to Figo,the dog. We tape the crystal on the inside of his collar and exactly 3 dayslater I get an ecstatic phone-call from the excited girl saying, “Aunty whatmagic did you do? The vets called a mini conference. They say they have neverseen anything like this.” Figo has not only got up, he is walking, running andback to being his old self. It is the magic of the crystals.• I have subsequently had a number of aging pet dogs who were flagging in theirenergies, finding it hard to walk actually begin jumping around all over againwith enthusiasm. Simply taping a bloodstone on the inside of their collar waswhat did it.• I had one of my favorite plants in my backyard beginning to show signs ofdying. I dug in a crystal in to the soil right next to it and lo and behold, myplant righted itself and was in a healthy state within a couple of weeks. When Iplace indoor plants next to some large crystals I have at home, I have noticedit takes a much longer time before they need to be put out again, not only thatI have noticed they actually grow more upright and seem to lean towards thecrystal as if they want to receive and soak up all the good energy from them.• They say a crystal ends up where it is meant to be, to the person it is meantto reach and I interestingly experienced this in a most amazing way. I was on aroad trip in the interiors of Australia with my family and we ended up in aplace called Coonacarabran where it turned out there was this amazing store forcrystals, which had been set up initially as a museum by this Australiangeologist who had a fantastic collection of zeolite crystals. I was excited tosee so many new crystals which at that point I had not had occasion to do backhome in India so I ended up buying quite a few. Because of my big purchase thelady at the counter who was the wife of the geologist presented me with a fewmagnetites, saying “if your husband keeps these in his pockets while flying, hewill never get deep vein thrombosis” I remember finding it strange she said thatbecause as a matter of fact my husband did have a problem on his last flightoverseas. On our return flight, we made sure to carry the crystals in ourpockets, got seats near the bulkhead of the plane where there is extra leg room;he was fast asleep when I woke up to find a woman had collapsed at my feet. Shewas surrounded by the airhostess and pilot and her partner who was trying torevive her. It took a moment to figure out she had had a stroke. I instinctivelyreached out for the crystals we had and asked that they be placed one each inboth of her hands. I said to her partner that I am a crystal healer and this isall I have with me at the moment and maybe we can try using it.The next thing I knew there was a big tear rolling down the old mans cheek;shaking his head smiling through his tears he said, “She is a crystal healertoo.” well, the flight was diverted to Darwin, my husband and I were sent toother seats and 4 hours later just before we landed at Darwin the airhostesswoke me, returned my crystals to me and said “ I don’t know what these are mydear, but they seem to work.” what’s the chance that I end up at the crystalstore without previously knowing of its existence, am gifted those crystalsensuring I carry them, the lady collapses at my feet, is a crystal healer tooand gets to use them at a time when she needed them most. Chance? Possibly.Coincidence? Maybe. Was it meant to be? Most likely, I would like to believe so.One way or other I am convinced to date that the crystals managed to do somedamage control that day on the flight all those years ago.So friends, cherish these crystals, nurture them and connect, for you neverknow, maybe we hear a similar successful story from you next!Bindu Maira has been a professional TAROT card reader and CRYSTAL HEALER for thelast fifteen years.

The next thought that came to my mind was that Iwanted to attend a good workshop, I want it in Pune and I want to connect toBabaji.Two days later, a Facebook post flashed an advertisement about a two-hour talkon Breath work by Leonard Orr, the father of Breath-work. I had taken trainingin Breath-work from Life Research Academy and have been practicing Breath- worksince last 8 years, but yes, to get trained by Leonard Orr himself would begreat and moreover, I would get to work on myself! I requested the organizer tolet me know if they could organize a minimum two days workshop. And to mysurprise, a seven days workshop was planned, and with total co-operation from myhusband and son to take responsibility of my ailing mother-in-law, I was on myway to the training!The entire workshop was not only a hands-on training but also a connection toBabaji, as Leonard has been gifted of the Breath-work by Babaji himself. And hehappens to be a believer of the Supreme goddess and Shiva. The concludingsentence of every topic in the workshop was - ‘ Jagdamba Mata Ki Jai. Bhole BabaKi Jai!’I learnt and re-learnt that, and what my practice of the last 8 years taught meabout Breath-work or the Re-Birthing Process is that Breath is a miracle. Andthat, Breath can cause miracles!BREATH- A word we know, or rather, we think we know. BREATH-That’s what we startthe journey in this body with.BREATH -That which we take before we make our transition to the life-between-lives state.BREATH-That changes with any and every emotion we experience. BREATH-That’s truesathi*!we start breathing when we are born. But does anyone teach us how tobreathe? Infact, at birth, aren’t we slapped if we don’t breathe? NO onecorrects our breath. Breath-work is here now. Just to correct our breath!Our breath changes to become slow or fast, shallow or fuller, varying as ouremotions change. Without realizing, we take the ‘Breath’ for granted. Many of usare not even aware that we are breathing! we forget to breathe to the best ofour capacity. In fact the tragedy is that we breathe just to keep us going.It is commonly believed that infancy and old age are similar, and that when wegrow old, we get slow, inactive and dependent. Senile. Just like a child. Andthen we stop living. As if old age is a ‘waiting for death’ period! Dear friendsIT NeeD NOT Be SO…we are unaware of how much can change with the breath that istaken to its full extent and utilized properly.We are not just the physical body we identify with. We are multi-sensory beings.We are physical extensions of the Divine Source. We are immortal. The body hasthe mechanism to heal without medicines and can be cured using the breath andthe gifts we are bestowed with by the Divine. We, too, can live like the yogisif we just use our breath to the fullest. Do you know that 98% of our body’scells are replaced once per year? Our stomach lining is new every 5 days. Ourskeleton changes every 3 months. We make a new liver every 6 weeks. In fact ourbody is designed for continual renewal and rejuvenation when it receives properattention and support. We can also live for millions of years if we follow thesimple rules that the god, the Creator has laid down. The Divine energy is thesource of our salvation. We receive salvation through the Seven Vehicles ofGrace. They help us to rejuvenate, balance and maintain our chakras. These 7rules to self-mastery are:Meditation- Thinking and studyWater- drinking and bathingEarth- nutrition, fasting, exercises massage and workAir- conscious energy breathingFire- purificationLove- having harmonious relationships, gurus, spiritual communityRest- pure relaxation, solitude and peaceOur breath is our connection to the Divine Life-Force. It is the primary sourceof nourishment and helps in eliminating all the unwanted thought, toxins andundesired emotions. Intuitive breathing is a skill that we can learn easily.Intuitive breathing is the ability to breathe energy as well as air. It involvesbreathing in a gentle relaxed rhythm.All the traumatic memories from our past are stored deep in the subconsciousmind and are reflected in the way we breathe. By changing the way we breathe wecan change the way we live.We have in us worries, tensions, fears, which is known as ‘a death urge’. Deathurge is a psychic entity that destroys the body by splitting it from the eternalLife Force. Without the eternal Life Force, body of beings become stiffer andmore solid till the spirit drops the body to become dust. This death urge can beconquered by out-living it by developing habits of aliveness, mantra, yoga,earth, air, water, fire and spiritual community. Breath-Work releases us fromthe death urge and increases in us the life urge.Leena, a college student, was ragged in the hostel. She tore up all hercertificates and stood in a frozen state for three days. When she came to me shewould shout at me when I started the process on her. After three days shestarted becoming calmer. The next week she borrowed from me some self-helpbooks. Ten sessions were enough to heal her and making her the old, rather, amore mature person!Breath is a vital link between the body, mind, emotions and the soul. Our breathvaries according to changes in emotions and the state of the body and soul. Andwhat are emotions? emotion=energy in motion. Whenever there is a stimulus, thereare thoughts. And they create emotions. Quantum physicists say that our emotionsare made of energy particles and if they are not expressed they remain trappedas energy in between the atoms and molecules of the cells of our body.Moreover, while taking birth the baby is exposed to harsh lights, harsh sounds;it is squeezed through the birthing canal and is manhandled. The birthingprocess is many times unnatural, i.e. A caesarean birth, a forceps delivery etc.This creates a birth trauma, which creates the first energy blockages in thisbody. These can be released by way of Breath-work, and hence, it is also knownas The Re- Birthing Process.Shailesh came to me with issues regarding his career. He was unable to moveahead in life. We started his BW sessions and he responded very well to theprocess. In the second session itself he could hear someone telling him to die.‘Don’t take birth,’ the voice said over and over again...And he could see a roomwith green curtains and doctors in a general conversation. He spoke to hismother and asked her what happened during his birth...Yes! It was the motherherself not wanting to give him birth. It so happened that his father did notwant the child and so his mother had come away to her mother’s place during thattime. In this condition, separated from her husband, she gave birth to the childand the child sensed her dilemma. She was thinking, but for the child she wouldbe with her partner now!We also have memories of our past-life traumas, which create energy blockages,and these can be understood, processed and released by BW. When we go throughtraumatic experiences in this life or the previous life, the emotions are storedand these are the energy blockages that hamper our growth on a spiritual and amental level. Memories as these traumatic moments are not only stored in thebrain but it is now widely accepted that they stored in every cell of the body!!These are effective if released by way of the BREATH-WORK or INTUTIVE BREATHINGor CONSCIOUS ENERGY BREATHING or RE- BIRTHING.Rajesh had numbness in his legs and palms since about ten years. He had intensefear of going out alone and felt a gripping fear of death. The BW sessionsbrought out intense pain in the numb parts of this body and slowly the numbnessdisappeared and his fears receded. He became independent and very confident.The ProcessBreath-Work or Re-Birthing process is a process of continuous connectedbreathing... It is the process where there is no gap between the inhalation andthe exhalation. The inhalation is merged into the exhalation. It is breathingeasily, gently, in a relaxed manner, to take in with air the Prana, the Tao, theChi, the Divine Energy. It is simply breathing. Breathing to the fullest.Actually, we do not make use of our entire lung capacity. And we feel we have todie to be with god! we don’t have to die to feel Him. Conscious energy Breathingor Breath-work gives us, and is called, a biological experience of God. Breathconnects us to the Divine Source, the god. It helps us to release all the energyblockages and our energy body is cleansed, and then begins transformation. Itproduces ecstasy. Conscious Connected Breathing has a healing ability that makesus spiritually self-sufficient. It energizes the body and the mind. The bonuseffect of the process is the realizations that we get. Breath- work gives usfresh and pure energy that makes us feel good, creative, productive andpeaceful. It cleans the blood and the nervous system. Negative emotions,feelings like anger, hatred, jealousy and sadness can be released just by way ofBreath-work. It releases us from depression and mood swings. Tensions and theemotional energy pollution that we have collected are released. If practiced ona regular basis, ailments like asthma, epilepsy, migraine headaches, cold, AIDSand cancer can be cured by BW. It helps us to release blockages that have keptus away from success.The TipSuccess in every area of life!! You can do Breath-work forever once you havelearnt it. It can be learnt from any trained Breath-worker/ Re-birther. Ten, oneto two-hour sessions are required to be done with a good Re-birther.It is such a simple technique that it cannot be believed until it isexperienced! So breathe.... Just breathe....Smita Wankhade is a Breath Worker, a Past life Regressionist, and a Reikimaster. She has been studying the benefits of meditation, creative visualizationand energy work and past-life regression. After having gone through differentexperiences in childhood like tuning to different realms, seeing a ‘soul’,out-of- the- body experiences, her curiosity about the mystics increased and sheunderstood these experiences when she began learning more about this subject.With her questions answered when she was introduced to the world ofspirituality, she realized that spirituality is a wisdom that brings joy whichhas to be experienced, and that, this joy has to be shared with all mankind!Having benefited from the breath work and past life regression sessions and witha natural flare for teaching, she realized that giving healing to others andspreading the knowledge of spiritual science is her purpose in life! Through herhealing sessions, people have found relief from issues, which were preventingthem from living a fuller life. Each of them found the purpose of their life andbeen able to balance their material and spiritual life.www.pastliferegressionindia.com [http://www.pastliferegressionindia.com/] "},{"pageContent":" Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 1.05.08 pm.png [../images/00048.jpeg] FOOD AS MEDICINE Dr. Ashish Paul “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” - HippocratesThe EssenceAny nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or plants absorb inorder to maintain life and growth is called food. Like all living beings wehumans had an evolutionary survival relationship with food for centuries. Humanbeings eat a mixture of plant origin and animal origin foods and these foodssustain us throughout our lives. All indigenous systems of healthcare ormedicine around the globe believe in therapeutic value of foods.Ayurveda is the oldest system of healthcare on the planet and it talksextensively about prevention, rejuvenation and longevity. It is the onlyindigenous healthcare system that has a whole branch dedicated for this calledRasayana and Vajikarna. Simple foods of our daily life become therapeutic ormedicinal when taken judiciously. For example: Amla Rasayana where Amla churna(powder) is given everyday for a set period of time in a subsequently increasingand then decreasing dosage. This is used as an intensive rejuvenate therapy inmany chronic conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune conditions or cancer forits powerful antioxidant effects.Ayurveda also talks about three pillars to sustain life; food, sleep andbiological wastes of the body.So food is part of the fundamental concepts of Ayurveda. Ayurveda is unique totalk about foods according to our mind-body types or personality types. InAyurveda, food is eaten according to our body types. We are all unique with ourown individual set of chemicals, neurochemicals, hormones, different absorptionand adsorption rates, digestion and our unique psychological and emotionalpatterns. So two people might eat the same food but the effect those foods willhave on their systems is completely different. We all know that even biologicalidentical twins can have completely different personality type let alone twodifferent individuals.The ProcessIn Ayurveda we have three main dosha types; vatta, pitta and kapha and threedual types; vatta-pitta, vatta-kapha, pitta-kapha and one tridoshic; vatu-pitta-kapha. Ayurveda explains each food according to these mind body constitutionaltypes. For example; in a pitta personality type hot and spicy foods must alwaysbe avoided because these can lead to hot diseases such as ulcers. In kapha typesthere is a tendency for accumulation of weight or water and are thus advised tonot eat heavy foods such as bread or cheese.All the foods in Ayurveda are divided according to vatta-pitta-kapha. Forexample most of the dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt are kaphaproducing. Most of the spices such as cumin seeds, paprika, green chillies,cinnamon, black pepper are heating and thus pitta increasing. Vatta aggravatingfood would be beans, peas, cold foods, cold drinks.Also foods are divided according to their special effects and called Sattvic,Rajsic or Tamasic foods due to the effects that they have on us psychologicallyand emotionally.Ayurveda also talks about ‘ama’. ‘Ama’ is the non-digested or partiallymetabolized food in the digestive tract that plays an important role in thepathogenesis of every disease. In Ayurvedic management of diseases ‘ama’ isalmost always treated along with the presenting symptoms. This concept has beenpicked up in the greek-Roman medicine that filtered down to western HerbalMedicine. Western Herbal Medicine believes that gut or digestive system must betreated in every disease. Even allopathic medicine knows now that most of ourimmune complexes are made in the digestive tract or gut so it must be thehealthiest to keep our immune system optimal. And we all know how bad digestivehealth is across the globe and we also know that autoimmune conditions are onthe rise.With the compromised digestive health we do not digest the foods that we eat anddo not comprehend the vitamins and minerals from the foods in our bodies. Thishas led us into eating concentrated forms of foods also called super foods tocompensate for the lack of nutrition.There is so much talk about the functional foods or nutraceuticals in modernnutrition now that everyone is taking some form of natural supplement to augmenttheir health. I strongly believe that when we are eating the right kind of foodat the right time according to our dosha type, the need to eat these nutritionalsupplements will be minimal.Today we have a more gluttonous complex sensual relationship with our foods buthave forgotten the real purpose of eating it. We are eating more for pleasure orfor emotional support and are paying less attention on the qualities of thefood. We as a society are eating out more and more for various reasons and take-away foods are made to please the tongue and not necessarily for health benefitsof any foods. We have all the scientific tools to substantiate all the medicinalproperties of our foods and then use them in our diet. So we are not just eatingfoods as a cultural or traditional recipe but clearly understand their benefitstoo.On a regular basis I have seen this in my clinical practice how quickly andeffectively dietary changes bring improvements in patient’s symptoms.Case study:Women 50 years, has chronic stomach ache after eating food, indigestion andbloating, chronic constipation. Many of these symptoms are typically present inpeople with Irritable bowel syndrome. According to Ayurveda it is a typicalvatta profile. Patient was advised to follow vatta-reducing diet according toAyurveda. No beans, peas, potatoes at nighttime meal. Warming spices such asginger, pepper, coriander, cumin seeds to be added to the meals. Good breakfast,good lunch and light cooked dinners. Food must be always cooked and warm and nocold foods. Digestive herbal tea after each meal was given and it generallycontains fennel, chamomile, ajwain, and a pinch of hing. Aloe Vera gel wasadvised to be taken internally regularly. Patient’s symptoms improvedconsiderably within first 4 weeks.The TipMy recommendation for anyone trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weightis to have no dinners or very light dinners. People can still have goodbreakfast and good lunch but as long as they eat light cooked dinner such assoups will maintain a healthy weight. In other words, they also need to avoidkapha-aggravating foods at nighttime. Eating right food is as important aseating it at the right time. This should be part of the lifestyle advice foreveryone especially young kids.Dr. Ashish Paul is a fully qualified Ayurvedic Practitioner (BAMS- Bachelor ofAyurvedic Medicine and Surgery) and a Medical Herbalist (BSc Hons HerbalMedicine).

They establish equilibriumbetween mind and body, the application of specifically related flowers helps incorrecting emotional distress that hampers well- being. Dr Edward Bach createdBach Flower Remedies for all ages of individuals and even plants and animals.The client meets the practitioner at a one-to-one session. Through the course ofthe conversation, the practitioner determines the client’s remedy requirement,and by a process of elimination, narrows down the choice of remedies. The methodis known for its simplicity. Certain flowers have a natural healing quality andthere are no adverse reactions or side effects. This is the safest and fastestway to find emotional balance.“Disease of the body itself is nothing but the result of the disharmony betweensoul and mind. Remove the disharmony, and we regain harmony between soul andmind, and the body is once more perfect in all its parts.” —Dr. Edward Bach.Dr. Edward Bach and the Bach Flower Remedy System: BackgroundThe Bach flower system was the first of its kind and remains the most thoroughset of Natural remedies for emotional distress. Failing within the umbrella ofcomplementary medicine, Bach flower remedies can and often should be a part ofprofessional healer’s arsenal of interventions. The remedies have been derivedfrom the specific flowers and are used in a number of different health caresettings, from various mediums of health care and wellness. The remedies haveproven to work in most unusual ways and The Bach system is one of the mostrecognized natural remedy systems by far. It works on People and animals both.It is 100% safe and non addictive, which are its strongest qualities.Parents continue to find Bach flower remedies attractive and effective becausethey are safe, and do not interfere with any other medication. It is said thatit “works in conjunction with herbs, homeopathy and medications and are safe foreveryone, including children, pregnant women, pets, the elderly and evenplants.”I appreciate the way the Bach flower remedies honor the power of nature ashealer. Flowers are most commonly appreciated only for their visual and aromaticbeauty. However, there is more to the floral kingdom than decoration. Like manyother plants, the 38 flowers used in the Bach system also offer the means bywhich to achieve wholeness and healing. The remedies have led me to think aboutplants and flowers differently, and with more respect. I do not look at mygarden in the same way; and I have a greater appreciation for the mystery ofnature’s beauty.The remedies have become for me a system whereby individuals can achieve harmonywith themselves and the world around them. I have used the flowers in this way,with positive results. Those I have worked with have similar reactions to theflower remedies. Peace of mind and well being are the most common reactions toregularly interacting with the flower remedies. They are not drugs; they are themeans by which to avoid needing drugs.As a special needs counsellor and educator, I have worked with a lot clients andthe use of the Bach Flower System has definitely made my life easier. I haveexperienced better results in a shorter duration of time and it has helped meovercome my stress cycle as well. I have to constantly deliver results and I getvery drained out when I need longer time to work on one case. Now, after usingthe Bach System on myself as well, I have felt more ease at work and I am ableto enjoy my work process without getting impatient. I have had clients who wouldnot have stayed the course of treatment with any other module other than theBach System. They themselves admit it. It is, by far the most easiest andsafest, with the convenience of anytime anywhere and any amount taken. Asspecial needs educator, my challenges with the temperament of children are acommon factor along with being bullied. The Bach system addresses them so easilythat one does not even realize how the change manifested in the course of netreatment bottle. My clients have even called ‘Miracle in a bottle’.Using Bach remedies along with other therapiesI had already begun work as a counsellor. The Bach flower essences fit in wellwith other types of healing I was drawn to, and became a part of a holisticapproach that I continue to cultivate today. The Bach flower system is aholistic type of complementary medicine because it “treats the person and notthe disease, considering each client as a unique individual rather thanprescribing a standard treatment for certain symptoms or diagnoses.”As I started to incorporate Bach flower remedies into the broader rubric of myown healing practice, I became confident of it being used to support inmainstream medicine. It is not important that doctors dismiss many types ofcomplementary care; so long as those methods of complementary care do not harm,they do not violate the Hippocratic Oath. Moreover, the Bach flower remedies aresafe. They are effective.Dr. Bach, whose work converged with early research in psychology, believed alsoin personality types. According to Dr. Bach, personality types were related todisease manifestation. When using the flower remedies, the practitioner mustdiscern between the issues that are chronic, or part of the person’spersonality, and the issues that are acute or temporary.After taking this course, I see the importance of receiving a more comprehensiveaccreditation in administering the Bach flower essences. While it is notessential that a healer receive accreditation, it is important to maintain anaura of creditability, and ensure patient safety by having a set of standardsthat Bach flower practitioners ascribe to in their practices. The course willenhance my confidence as a practitioner and also offer me networkingopportunities that can be monetized in the future.The practitioner- licensing course for Bach slower essences has tremendouslyenhanced my skills as a practitioner, as well as boosted my confidence inadministering the right flower remedies every time. Whereas I used to consult mybooks when meeting with clients, I now know by heart the uses of each flowerremedy and can quickly prescribe formulas that are individualized andpersonalized. Because “individuals with serious medical or emotional conditionsshould not rely on Bach flower remedies alone for treatment,” I am cautious whenprescribing the remedies. The course has taught me the ethical parameters ofworking as a healer, and how to recognize in others symptoms of resistance tohealing. I have worked with several individuals who are averse to seeingdoctors, and have coached them to overcome their fears and accept what modernmedicine has to offer while also relying on the remedies for their mental andemotional well being. I would never discourage someone from taking medicationprescribed by a doctor, but I also encourage my clients to rely on their ownmental, emotional, and spiritual reserves rather than on drugs. The purpose ofBach flower remedies is to enhance overall healing.We have a range of Flower essence ingestible remedies for all spectrums of:1. Dyslexia2. ADHD3. ADD4. Post Trauma5. Lack of Focus6.

According to the National SleepFoundation, about 70 million people experience sleep-associated problems. Almost40 million suffer from chronic sleep disorders, and an additional 20 to 30million are affected by intermittent sleep-related problems. Even worse, mostpeople ignore the problem; few think they actually have one. Only half of thosepolled by the foundation earlier this year were able to say they slept well onmost nights; and one-fourth of adults say sleep problems have some impact ontheir daily lives Richard gelula, the foundation’s CeO, said there’s a linkbetween sleep and quality of life.“People who sleep well, in general, are happier and healthier,” he said. “Butwhen sleep is poor or inadequate, people feel tired or fatigued, their socialand intimate relationships suffer, work productivity is negatively affected, andthey make our roads more dangerous by driving while sleepy and fewer alerts.”Sleeping medications, including sedative/hypnotic medications, like Ambien, arerecommended for short-term use, but lots of people take them frequently andbecome dependent upon them to fall asleep. Sleep-inducing medications,especially when taken over long periods of time, stay in the bloodstream, givinga hangover the next day and beyond, impairing memory and performance on the joband at home. All medications interact with other medications to one degree oranother, sometimes with harmful effects. Finding a natural product or modifyingour patterns of behaviour to get a good night sleep is a good first approachwith little or no harmful consequences.There are questions about the effectiveness of sleeping pills. A study byresearchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical Schoolfound that a change in sleep habits and attitudes was more effective in treatingchronic insomnia, over the short- and long-term, than sleeping pills(specifically Ambien). Ambien is the most prescribed pharmaceutical product toinduce sleep, chemically. Earlier this month, it was reported that some Ambienusers are susceptible to amnesia and walking in their sleep. Some even ate inthe middle of the night without realizing it. In contrast, Bach well-known“Rescue Remedy”, its 38 specific natural remedies and the just released naturalsleep remedy, “Rescue Sleep”, acts organically upon our feelings and emotions tobring us emotional balance and a sense of well-being.The original Bach natural remedies have been used confidently in Europe for over100 years. Among Bach Remedies most visible advocates in America are JenniferAnniston who says it keeps her cool under pressure. Kate Blanchett and SalmaHayek have been fans for years. Roberta Flack uses “Rescue Remedy” soothingeffect for menopausal hot flashes.The new release, “Rescue Sleep” contains the 5 effective ingredients of “RescueRemedy” plus white Chestnut. White Chestnut is effective against restless mind.Case StudiesDescription of client – age, sex, marital status, number of children, etc.A middle-aged lady in her late 50’s. Married with one son. Having a palecomplexion and thin-built with an aura of stress visible on her shoulders.Outline of the problem for which the client came for treatment.A middle-aged lady with an autistic son was worried about their future. She hadbeen wondering if she dies earlier than her son, who will look after him. Howwill he go on with his life? Her age was catching up and she was not able to doas much as earlier.Client’s knowledge of the remedies.The client’s had observed my earlier client’s son having been able to transformhis temper and improve overall focus. She asked the parent how the changehappened and learnt about Bach Flower Remedies. Her idea of the remedies wasthat they are safe and can do what allopathy cannot. She had a detailedconversation with the parent who also told her about Dr. Bach’s system beingabout treating the person and not the disease.First impressions. How the client appeared, behaved, etc.The client had a nervous disposition and also guilt and embarrassment abouthaving a son with autism. Her in-laws had been hard n her about it. She had losther spark and was only a shadow of what she once was. Yet, she was open- mindedabout trying the remedies and comfortable in talking about her situation withme.My introduction to and explain of the Bach system; the main body of theinterview; My interactions with the client and his/hers with me; how I obtainedinformation to enable me to choose appropriate remedies.I started with introducing my client t to the system –The Bach flower remedies are natural remedies derived from 38 specific flowers.Dr. Edward Bach, a medical doctor during his early ages has discovered thissystem and remedies. All of us go through stressful situations in our life.These can be overwhelming emotionally. The Bach system of remedies helps usrestore balance.InteractionsShe began to trust me once I showed her how she can find a balance in thesituation through the Bach Flower remedies. She spoke about how her married lifeand overall life had been affected by her having a son with such a disability.With each interaction, she was becoming a more confident and someone who startedto look forward to having fun in life rather than just brooding over herproblems and more so the perceived problems of the future. She always gave outclear hints of what remedies to go with. Every time I asked her how she wasfeeling the day she visited for a consultation, her answers were “I am feelinglike how will I go on with the day?” or “Today I am more worried than most days,as today my father-in-law asked me what arrangement have I made for my son ifsomething were to happen to me?” or “I am too tired to go on with life and I donot see clear skies in the future.”All of these sentences coming from her were indications so close to the remediesto be used for her. It seemed like at some level she had connected so well withthe remedies that Dr. Bach was himself guiding to see which one to give her.Remedies considered.The first time I thought of using Pine, elm, Clematis, and Chestnut bud, whiteChestnut, Hornbeam and Mimulus.The remedies above were the most appropriate choices for my client. When ourinitials consultations about her feeling what she at that time was clear, Ilooked at what best to give her immediate relief.This combination was most appropriate for her situation and she took to itreally well. The client was very vocal and clear of what she has come to me for,and right from the start it was clear about how to take course, so there were nochanges in the mid way.Remedies chosen and reasons for my selection. Reasons for not giving otherremedies that could have applied.I chose remedies on the basis of how to relieve her from the stress andmagnitude of the burdened life that she was living. I had brought the chart ofthe Bach Flower remedies and framed and kept in the consultation. I asked her tolook at the chart and see what she can relate to with the remedies. I chose forher. She looked at the chart and felt she wanted to go with what I had chosen.She was comfortable with the remedies I had selected for her. Since it was herfirst time, she also wanted to go with the flow and see how it works out forher. I felt the smoothness of her acceptance to the remedies helped her healsooner than had expected.Follow up and progress made. Development of the treatment programme, and changesin mixture with reasons for any changes.My client came for a follow up after 3 weeks. There was a remarkable differencein her. She had returned from a holiday and had a makeover in her appearance,which was refreshing. I almost did not recognize her. She said the remedy helpedher get good sleep and she found herself smiling a lot more and wanting to giveherself time as well. She had not complained about her appearance once shestarted the remedies.This time, she wanted herself gain more ability to handle situations with easerather than wanting them to go away. She has also realized how she had inspiredother mom’s to connect and share their lives and worries forming a group. Sheobviously headed it and made a page on Face book where there can all be therefor each other when needed. The mother who came to me so worried is now helpingothers overcome their problems.I had good reason to make changes in the remedy. I changes Chestnut Bud, WhiteChestnut, Hornbeam, Mimulus and Pine. They had done their job. She was nowsteady on Clematis, elm and Oak. Along with which I felt the need to addCentaury. Though she was refreshed in her life, she also needed to give herselfthe luxury of being there for herself and not always doing it for other. Ireally liked the outcome and so did she. She did tell all mothers about the BachFlower Remedies. Rather, she started the trend.Overall Progress made during the whole course of treatment or treatment periodthus far if still going on.She made dramatic progress in the first treatment itself, Post the treatment,she did two follow ups and then on it was not necessary as she found a goodemotional balance and stayed the course, She also gained her long lost self. Ihave mentioned the entire progress in the above section.Present state. His/Her client’s expectations, hopes and plans for the future inrespect of continued treatment, other avenues to explore, and generaldevelopment of well being.My Client and I saw the remarkable difference of the natural remedies by Dr.Bach. She felt alive again after decades. The remedies more than met with herexpectations. She joined a yoga and singing class. She was now self motivatedand driven to live life and enjoy it. I feel this case was a huge motivation forme too.Aryanish was born dyslexic, but overcame the challenge at an early age.

Ponderingover what I really love doing I came up with: exercise, being creative,believing in a positive energy field, and sharing this with others. The idea of“Sport & Spirit” was born. Being aware of the connection between body, mind,emotions, and spirit, one realizes that we create a positive energy field whenwe do something we love to do. Exercise is also one of the most powerful toolsto feel good. I observed this not just with myself, but also with many people Imet and interacted with in my 10 years of professional work as a fitness trainerand spiritual coach. People who do exercise seem to be more balanced, happierwithin themselves, and also look healthier. Around 10 years back I got reallycurious about this topic. Why did exercise make such a big difference inpeople’s lives? The explanation of medical research, that our glands releasehormones (viz. Endorphins) in our body when we exercise, which in turn makes ushappy, seemed to be an effect of something bigger – but not the cause. I startedto research this topic on a spiritual basis and found that we are dealing withthe universal energy itself. When we make the conscious effort of training, weare pulling the pure positive energy through our energy centers into our auraand our body. This has such a powerful effect, that it can clear blockages,negative thoughts, tension, and emotional imbalance.One of my clients, a woman, started to exercise with me. She was in greatturmoil because she’d gone through a divorce a couple of years earlier. She feltunattractive, weak, and was overweight. She’d just fallen in love with anotherman and doubting whether this man liked her too. It was a long journey ofphysical and spiritual training to convince this woman that she was lovable.The physical exercise motivated her so much that she could transform her beliefsystem and get the power to lose weight and believe that she was lovable.Finally, they got together and, are still a couple. There are many stories likethis, where people transformed their beliefs about themselves, using exercise toconnect to their own power. There is an old saying: “You are what you think.”Sometimes we are not even aware of what is going on in our minds since we get soused to our thinking habits. Our emotional state shows us whether we are reallyhappy (i.e. healthy) with our belief system about ourselves or our lives. Aftera longer period of feeling down, often because of having negative thoughts, thephysical body begins to shut down too and you become sick, sometimes very sick.But you have the power to create balance: you are the creator of yourwell-being. The most effective way to clear your aura, retune your chakras andtransform your belief system, is through physical and spiritual practice.Imagine your aura and body as a house getting stuffy and dirty from too muchsitting around, poor diet, emotional overreactions and stress. You start toclean up, open the windows and let fresh air in, take the garbage and broom andpolish out. What a feeling! That is what physical exercise does for you. Throughexercise, the chakras become activated and draw pure unprocessed energy into themany layers of your energy system and physical body. Congested energy is pushedout, negative blocks disappear, and depleted energy is renewed.It’s not only mental or emotional beliefs that block the flow of energy: poordiet and too much sitting around also weaken you and your self-esteem. One of myclients worked in an office and ate fast food when he found time to eat. Hisface was gray, his skin showed low blood circulation and, he had no energy left.He could hardly concentrate on his work – so the outcome was accordingly poor.His self-esteem had gone downhill and he knew he had to get help. After onemonth’s physical training, a new diet and spiritual motivation, he transformedhimself into a new man. Physical and spiritual work go hand in hand.After intense research, observations and evaluations, I found the best outcomein training when I worked with the energy of the four elements. They flowthrough us and can be activated through the four training types, which aredirectly linked to the four elements. Different intentions create differentoutcomes.1. For energy and to feel vital and active: Cardio training; element: Fire.2. For strength, muscle tone, posture and self-esteem: Resistance training;element: earth.3. For flexibility, subtleness and self-awareness: Flexibility training;element: Air.4. For balance, calmness and inner peace: Relaxation training; element: water.The four elements are the major vibrational building blocks of our earth. Theybalance, complement, and also oppose each other. It’s the same with the fourtraining types: if you want to create an optimal energy flow, you should combinedifferent training types; or if you really like to work on a specific issue,choose a training type which can help you to best manifest the outcome you arelooking for. Effort creates reward and balance. With exercise you are activatingyour natural potential to look good, feel good, and think positively. But youneed persistence and discipline and, if this doesn’t come naturally to you, tryto become this person. There is nothing more rewarding then turning a beliefaround. I am talking about my own experience. I have turned many beliefs around– and am still doing it. One of my misleading beliefs was that I had nodiscipline. But as I look at myself now, I see a very disciplined person. Everybelief is changeable. Take your time, start slowly, start steadily, but do it!Theresia Eggers is the founder for “Intune” Program. Intune- The program isTheresia’s vision and interpretation of a holistic exercise program. It workswith the energy of Four elements- Fire, Earth, Air and Water, which are a partof everyone of us, and the activation of seven chakras. The goal of this programis to make you feel whole by connecting to all the different aspects of yourselfthrough a training that includes body, mind, emotion and spirit.www.sportandspirit.co [http://www.sportandspirit.co/] "},{"pageContent":" Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 1.05.39 pm.png [../images/00051.jpeg] SAY YES TO MONEYCREATE A HAPPY RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY Suresh Padmanabhan The best month to have Money is December, some of the other months areOctober, April, August, March, May, January, July, September, November, June,and February - Suresh PadmanabhanClose your eyes and review your money life now. What is it at present? Do youthink you have actually had great money potential but somehow money flow is notright. I have been conducting Money workshops across many parts of the worldsince 15 years and having spoken to more than a million people, I realize that“Money is an issue deep down with many”.The only difference is some have guts to confront it, whilst others push itunder the carpets. Some just do not want to look into the money aspect, some areplaying escaping games, and some are praying that money takes care of itself.You would have observed that people less talented are making more money thanyou. I have seen highly talented nice people who are skilled in their professionbut lost when it comes to money. It gives a lot of pain to watch this. Talenthas gone waste. There is a fight between what you love and money flow. What youlove might not give money, so you get trapped in a job, profession or business,which is paying but not nourishing. Some day you say, you will do that Job whichyou love. And sadly that day never comes.My Own Personal Life StoryI hail from a typical middle class tamil family. My dad was working in aclerical cadre with the Government of India. I was told a family secret in mychildhood. Study Hard, Live Simple, Earn Less but have Good Values and WorkHard. Nowhere in my family dictionary was Earn Big, Work Easy, and Do Business.When I asked that taboo question, my father said a simple answer- “you are asouth indian and not a guajarati, punjabi or a marwari.”My life was exactly as per my family standards. Having passed from a managementschool I joined the world of advertising. I ended up working hard. My wholefamily was happy but not very Happy because I did not fulfill their dream ofworking for a government organisation. Everyone was happy except me.I was seeing the sparkle in my sindhi, marwari, guajarati friends who weremaking so much money by running their family business. Their life was big, grandand limitless. My life was small, mediocre and full of scarcity.I wanted all this to change and change Fast. I dared to be different. To startwith, I started investing all that I earned into the stock markets. Suddenly Ihit a jackpot. Goddess Lakshmi started showering her blessings and my moneystarted to grow. While my dad was happy with his 8 % to 10 % in the FD of a bankor the post office, Here I was making 40% , 60 % and even 200% in the stockmarket. The going was super good. My family got tempted and they also gave theirhard earned money to me to invest into the stock market. My dad’s friends, Myown friends all gave me money to invest. I was suddenly the blue eyed investmentbanker to one and all. Everyone was enjoying the ride and I was flying high. Iwanted more. Dil Mange More. Greed possessed me. I then discovered the world ofspeculation. So called F & O ( futures and options). I lost caution to the wind.I became possessed, reckless and unguarded.And one day everything changed. The stock markets crashed, along it my money, myfamily money and money of my friends. Huge losses. It would have took me yearsto even come back to zero. My dreams crashed. I kept slipping, making onemistake after the other. And I ended in the darkest phase of my life.Then I realized the harsh realities of money. I lost my name, face, friends andmyself. I was down and out. I started the blame game. Why me? I am honest,sincere, did not do anything bad for anyone and I assumed for sure god punishesonly good people and life is unfair. The more pessimistic I became worsen mysituation turned out to be. I forgot to read, meditate and be happy with myfriends. I had few support and more so from my family. I was in a dark cavewaiting for light. Time just went by.One day it just hit me. I had to take responsibility for my money actions. Ihave to move on. I gathered courage, became positive in my thoughts and startedtaking small micro steps towards brightness. I read, re- read, meditated, prayedand learnt more about the stock market. If I had gained once there, I could gainonce again. I now had the conviction. I borrowed money from my parents with anassurance that I would get out of all my money Issues. Over a period of time, Iemerged stronger. I started clearing all my debts. And soon I was again in apositive cash flow. But it took years, lot of struggle, lot of hard- work. Butthe experience was huge. I became the hero of my own story. And one day moneyworkshop just flashed into my life. It was a divine blessing by god who possiblytested my patience. It was a prasad he gave me. I got my life back; I got amission to teach about money to one and all. It is 15 years since and because itis a god’s blessing and a moving experience of my own, Money workshop turned outto be a greatest original authentic workshop on money. Today so many workshopsare modeled on money workshop. It makes me immensely proud to have created moneymagic in so many lives.Isn’t it the Time to Wake Up and Smell the Money?Money, Money, Money- It is everywhere. If it is not in your pocket, it is inyour head. It is part of everybody’s life and it is a part of you. It has suchgreat power that it can command attention from everyone.Understanding Money is Understanding LifeThe biggest lie you have ever heard is, “Money is not important in my life.”There is enough proof that whatever you are today and whatever you will ever beis shaped by money. It is a bunch of hypocrites who keep saying, “Money is notimportant in my life.”Everything you are today is an outcome of the money flow in your life — yourstatus, net worth, and self-image...Money is needed to get you started and keep you going through life. It is verymuch like the fuel and oil that is needed to keep your vehicle running. Run outof fuel and your vehicle stops. Run out of money and your life could stop. It isas essential as the air you breathe, as vital as mother’s milk to a new bornbaby or the blood circulating in your body. Whether you love it or hate it, yousimply cannot live without money.Forget friends; look at your own shadow. When the sun is shining brightly, yourshadow also follows you so faithfully. When it is dark, your shadow toodisappears. Without Money you realize “you are a nobody from nowhere.”You may have felt life was just like Maths. Disappearance of friends is directlyproportional to disappearance of money.Take Some Money Actions Now!Develop a Happy Relationship with MoneyDrop your seriousness around Money and make it playful and joyful.

As in any game, the vital elements in the moneygame are knowledge of the rules and skill of the players. With increasingpractice your skills increase by leaps and bounds.Learn About Money- But Only Once and For a Lifetime“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write,but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.” -Alvin TofflerMoney is like learning to play music. First you play with all rules then youforget the rules and play by the heart. As children we all avoided the subjectsin which we were weak and this habit still continues. Plunge into the world ofmoney. Read, watch motivational videos on money and attend workshops. Masterthis subject once and for all.Take 100 % Responsibility for Your Money LifeWe need to summon the courage to take ownership of all our thoughts, deeds,knowledge, actions, choices, experience, most importantly, our success andfailures. Becoming honest and transparent with our issues of money will help usovercome it forever. Encounter and demolish the fears of money. Fear is not justforgetting everything and run. But face everything And rise. As you takeresponsibility the whole universe sends you resources and power to becomesuccessful.Review all your Belief SystemsBelief is what is true For you. If you believe money is scarce, struggle, tough,it will turn out to be that. People who are healers, tarot card readers, energyworkers, light workers, and new age therapist sometimes get this wrong beliefthat one should not charge money for their work. They create a split personalityand conflict with money from inside. Some of them do free work. Deep down theyare highly disappointed but just fool themselves that “All is well”. Don’t fakeyour life, it is hard work. They get disturbed with smart new age therapists whomake good money and also have a lot of clients.All free or low paid services are not appreciated. Once you set a low standardfor yourself, it becomes so difficult to change it later.Have respect for your profession by giving your very best and also chargingappropriately. Remember money is also energy. Become comfortable with it. Thenmagic happens. You feel good with yourself. You attract the best clients whorespect your energy work and most important even your energy flows well.Brand Yourself WellWhen you brand yourself well, the competition becomes irrelevant. It just doesnot exist. What people think about you, your brand and your service reallymatters. Your brand is a story that should do the talking. Learn all abouttechnology. Get a good website. Create a powerful presence in Facebook, Twitteror LinkedIn. Write a super blog. Make classy presentations. All your visitingcards, brochures and your promotional material should be done professionally andspell class. Times are changing super fast so adapt or be left behind.Some Quick Techniques that you can Act Upon NowBuy a good quality wallet. Buy a cash box for your business or home. Money comesto those who are ready. You send a powerful message to the universe that now youare ready for big money flow.Organise money neatly wherever it is placed. When Money is scattered life isscattered. Organising Money is organising thoughts about money thereby leadingto a healthy money flow.Do Daily AccountingAnother invaluable practice is that of maintaining daily accounts. Dailyaccounting is simple. You need to account for each rupee coming and going out ofyour life. Account as it happens. Each one of us has just about ten to twelvetransactions each day. Keeping the bills organised and in one place will enhancethe process.Beware that your mind right now must be telling you, “Hey, what big differenceis it going to make?” or “nobody ever became rich because of writing theiraccounts,” or anything else that will prevent you from writing the accounts.Daily accounting is painful, but so was brushing our teeth or taking a bath inchildhood. It may seem boring or lot of work, but it’s essential for holisticmoney growth and for a factual picture of your strengths and weaknesses. Throughprecise accounting, troublesome money patterns like excessive spending or poorsavings can be curbed. Even if you now hate figures it’s not so hard to grow tolove them.Remember “Daily Accounts” is writing accounts daily and not all the account ofthe week on a Sunday. And that Sunday never comes!When the account is in the mind, it does not give a clear picture. As you put itinto writing, clarity starts coming in. Now you can see every account as it is.This is called “chunking” (sorting into smaller bits). Now you can see variousheadings of accounts very clearly — for e.g. Food expenses, travel expenses,communication costs, rent etc. You can exercise control over money only when youhave the details. If you realise that the food bills are high then the nextmonth you can cut it down. Most of the times a mere realisation that “Food billsare high” will ensure that the expenses are cut down naturally. I have greatrespect for my father, who all through his life time maintained perfect “DailyAccounts.” He never forgot to write the daily accounts even for a single day.This ensured that he never had to face a big money problem in life.You may have 100’s of reasons for not writing the “Daily Accounts” but once youget into a habit you will be more disturbed if you forget or don’t write the“Daily Account.” well you can ask anyone who is maintaining “Daily Accounts.”Personal Money RitualsEach day carry a min of Rupees 11,000.00 in person. Remember money attractsmoney. If your mind resists this idea for whatever reason think If you cannothandle a mere 11000 Rupees how will you handle a million.Always count money towards yourself and not away from you.The color that attracts money is red and green. Hence our own goddess MahaLakshmi is always dressed in fine, rich green or red Saree. For starters youcould have a green or a red wallet.Remember money day is friday. Shukrawar. The energy that influences money is theplanet Venus. You many take powerful money actions on friday which is the moneyday world-wide. The other auspicious days are full moons where maximummanifestation happens and also money being a feminine energy, the influence ofmoon is highest.Free Money ResourcesWe have created the most powerful mantras in the world on Money and Abundance.They are the largest hits on YouTube.

The turmoil about the crossroads he stood upon seemed to vanish, andit was replaced by a sense of deep inner calm. He no longer worried about theright thing to do, because the wisdom of his subconscious mind had shown himexactly why this experience was important for his evolution and what he ought todo. He smiled at me and uttered a word of thanks for having helped him discoverthe power of his own mind.All of us know that we have a mind but not everyone is aware that we actuallyhave two minds. The western world and psychologists refer to these as theconscious and subconscious mind while the eastern complimentary sciences such asAyurveda, speak of the inner or deeper consciousness, and the outer or sensorymind. 41.png [../images/00054.jpeg] The conscious outer mind that most people are familiar with constitutes only thetip of the proverbial mind-sphere iceberg and is responsible for cognition,reasoning, analysis, evaluation, calculation, judgement and decision-making. Itfeeds off the five senses to perceive its reality and helps you arrive atsuitable conclusions. So when your eyes see an overcast sky, your conscious mindconcludes that when you step out of your house that morning, you should carry anumbrella.The subconscious or inner mind constitutes almost 88% of the whole mind and isthe storehouse or repository of all your long term memories and impressions bothfrom this life as well as past lives.All positive and negative experiences that you have ever had, are stored hereand the resulting impressions are embedded as beliefs, attitudes, tendencies andhabits which determine the hardwiring of your brain. This is akin to a librarywhere your soul’s personal records are stored and maintained.Now if it so happened that at age two you had met with a car accident on acloudy day, chances are that even 32 years later, when you see the sky overcast,you may feel anxious and restless. For no apparent reason you may decide thatyou don’t feel like driving to work and prefer instead to take the train. Yourconscious mind will rationalise that decision because it must analyse yourfeelings and may conclude that taking the train on that day makes much bettersense because the traffic is always terrible on Thursday’s. You end up believingthat choosing the train ride to work is an active choice; but is it really?The reason you are not aware that choosing the train was motivated by thesubconscious mind is because these two minds are separated by the critical mindwhich acts as a doorkeeper of your inner consciousness. It operates as a guardthat does not permit entry into the subconscious mind in beta brain wavefrequency, which simply stated, is your active everyday ordinary awareness, andhence you cannot recall the memory of that accident at age two.Bridging The Two MindsBoth these minds interact and engage with each other guiding, directing andaffecting how we think, perceive information, behave, act and relate to life’schallenges. While the conscious mind is what you are normally aware of, it’s thesubconscious mind that is really pulling the strings like a puppeteer whocontrols the puppet, but is never seen. How many times have you decided to go ona diet only to find yourself gorging on that irresistible chocolate cake? Ormade a New Year resolution to quit smoking and broken it on the second ofJanuary?The reason is that while your logical mind tells you not to eat the chocolatecake because it is unhealthy for you, the data stored in the subconscious mindsends out powerful signals instructing you to eat it, since all pastassociations with eating chocolate cake embedded in the subconscious mind arepositive. So while 12% of your mind says no, 88% of your mind says a resoundingyes. Is it any surprise that you end up breaking your resolve?The conscious mind makes the intent, but it’s the subconscious mind that steersand drives your behaviour. In order to understand why you act and behave in theways that you do, it is important to uncover the associations and motivationsthat lie hidden in your subconscious mind. It is these associations thatdetermine your choices and each time that you act them out, they are furtherreinforced making those preferences habitual or hardwired in you.So think about this, every time X ignores you it only strengthens your beliefthat perhaps X does not like you. What you are unaware of, is that you perceivethis event through the filter of a past memory which is triggered in yoursubconscious mind when you felt similarly ignored, albeit a long time ago whichyou may not remember. You begin to feel uncomfortable around X and startavoiding him. As this continues to recur, there comes a time when even the sightof him stresses you out triggering your defences and releasing a surge ofadrenaline and cortisol into your blood stream making you want to run.Since you don’t ordinarily have access to the subconscious mind, you are notaware of the deeper reasons for feeling and behaving as you do. You wonder whyyou dislike X even though you have no obvious reasons to do so, and you remainstuck in the vicious circle of disliking and avoiding him, feeling unworthy inhis presence and by association disliking him even more because you associate Xwith feeling rejected and unworthy.If however you could go into your subconscious mind and change the belief that Xdislikes you, it could transform your relationship with him. So let’s say if youfound out that X had not meant to ignore you that very first time you felt thisway, but had just received news that his mother was hospitalised and wasovercome by grief, you would perceive that situation very differently andperhaps even feel kindly towards him.Or if you discovered that X actually reminded you of Uncle Tom who never likedyou as a child, you could heal that original experience with Uncle Tom and itwould change how you felt about X. However the important question is, how canyou get past the doorkeeper of the critical mind to reach the subconscious, fromwhere you can dig these memories out and access this hidden knowledge?Using Hypnosis as the BridgeHypnosis can allow you to bypass the critical factor and focus on selectivethinking, allowing effective and speedy access into your subconscious mind. Itcan bridge your past with your present and unravel memories and experiences thatcompel you to feel, think and behave in ways that easily override your consciousdecisions. It leads you into a trance- like, deeply relaxed alpha state intowhich the subject is guided by the hypnotist, by getting his attention to slippast the doorkeeper of the subconscious or the critical mind.In this dreamlike state, the subject can now recall information from other timesor states of consciousness. He still has a fuzzy awareness of his present andimmediate surroundings which creates a kind of elliptical awareness whereby hecan be in both states simultaneously, focussed more there and less here andhence, not only recall but also digest information that is retrieved from thepast giving rise to insight and integration of the data recovered.Researcher, teacher and author Dr Joe Dispenza1 describes this state perfectlywhen he says that the brain literally becomes unaware of time (because we losetrack of time), we lose awareness of the environment (we don’t see anythingbecause our visual cortex shuts off), and we don’t have any concept of our body.In fact, we don’t feel like we are in our body anymore – all we see is thatimportant thought in our mind. This process is called dissociation. It happenswhen we naturally dissociate from the constant sensations of the body in theexternal world in linear time. We are no longer associating with our sense ofself with our environment.What is so amazing is that we dissociate all the time in our normal lives likewhen reading an interesting book, driving on the highway, watching an engrossingfilm or playing video games. Trance is about learning, and as Elmar Woelm2 says,it involves learning to go into trance, learning to get into contact with onessubconscious resources and learning to widen ones range of beliefs.When you are driving on the highway, it’s easy to zone out and lose track oftime because your mind gets focussed inwards becoming absorbed in either themusic that’s playing on the radio, or immersed in the scenery or even thinkingabout that fabulous holiday that you enjoyed last summer. You could become soabsorbed in these thoughts that you might even forget that its way past lunchhour and your stomach is growling for food, or wonder how you reached yourdestination so fast.This then is the experience of the hypnotic state during which you gain entryinto your subconscious mind. During this trance- like state, the externalreality is temporarily suspended as the mind turns inwards and focuses sharplyon the subject of enquiry. This is a highly creative state and most artistesproduce some of their greatest works from this state of consciousness.Hypnosis which comes from the greek word Hypnos means to sleep. This does notimply that you lose control over yourself while in hypnosis, but that your mindturns inwards and does not engage with the external environment just as insleep. A skilled hypnotherapist can easily induce such a state of trance in asubject and then proceed to look for the source of his suffering, be it mental,physical or emotional by using effective therapeutic techniques that allow forthe healing to happen.In this highly imaginative and creative state, it is the subject’s mind itselfthat provides the solutions to his problems, as Anand discovered, while thetherapist merely facilitates and allows for insights to surface and the healingto occur.Using Hypnosis for HealingI remember an amusing incident that occurred on a flight back from one of myhealing intensives in the country. There was a dapper gentleman sitting next tome and he spent a long time chatting up and telling me about his ceramicbusiness. When we reached our destination and boarded the bus to the airportbuilding, he casually enquired about my profession. The minute he learned I wasa hypnotherapist, he jerked his body away from mine, aghast with fear and almostbegged me not to hypnotize him.Most people have the mistaken impression that a hypnotist will put you under hiscommand, depriving you of free- will and leaving you with no control over thesituation. Nothing can be further from the truth. This impression has beenerroneously created by the entertainment industry, particularly movies and stagehypnotists whose primary purpose is to entertain, amuse and shock the audiences.Clinical hypnotherapy uses hypnosis with the sole intention of healing andtherapy work. However, there are few aspects that are critical for the successof this approach.• First and foremost it requires that the subject or client be willing to enterinto hypnosis without which it is virtually impossible to create a successfultrance. Many a time clients bring their grown up children or spouses to myclinic wanting to help them de-addict or change some unhealthy pattern. However,unless the subject himself requests for therapy, I do not take on these casesbecause no matter how skilled a therapist you are, you cannot assist in healingsomeone who does not want to heal himself. Furthermore, such people are unlikelyto enter into a hypnotic trance because their subconscious mind will resist it.• Secondly, the quality of trance is important and this must be ascertainedbefore proceeding with therapy work because different issues need differentlevels of trance depth. Some therapies are better performed under light trancewhile others require medium or deep trance.• Thirdly, creating a good trance only opens the door to the subconscious mindbut you now need to determine how to get to the source event or what caused theproblem in the first place. The therapist must be well versed to guide anddirect the search to the source of the problem.• Fourthly, the therapist must have enough training and tools at his disposal tosuccessfully conduct the therapy work which is always unique to each case andcannot be standardised. Knowledge about mental health and psychotherapy can begreatly beneficial in doing this work.• Fifthly, you must be equipped to think on your feet and change tracks ortechniques as required. For as someone once said, it’s like searching for thetreasure and if the key you are using to unlock the treasures of the mind doesnot work, make sure you have others handy.• And last though not the least, appropriate use of post hypnotic suggestions,and where required, future progressions must be employed to integrate andcomplete the therapy work. This is why it is commonly said that putting somebodyinto trance is the easy bit, but knowing what to do after they have beenhypnotized is where the real challenge lies.Clinical uses of Hypnosisa.Suggestion therapyThere are broadly two major approaches used in clinical work, namely suggestiveand analytic. Suggestion therapy employs the use of direct or indirectsuggestions under hypnosis to create desired outcomes and to modify behaviour.This method has several applications and is widely used to enhance sportsperformance, help people to quit smoking, in alcohol de- addiction, reversingthe habit of nail biting and enuresis (bedwetting in children), building selfesteem, stress release, pain management and dental hypnosis, to name just a few.I have also used hypnosis quite effectively to improve academic performance inchildren who either have trouble concentrating or tend to procrastinate and putoff studying for their exams. These children have shown note worthy improvementand gone on to score good grades, greatly improving their self confidence.In one of my cases, I used dental hypnosis to assist a 10 year old boy to remainperfectly calm and relaxed during a series of dental extractions. The blood andsaliva flow post the extractions was considerably reduced and he was able toundergo all the extractions painlessly.Hypnotic suggestions are also useful in overcoming nausea in pregnant women,fear of public speaking in those whose expression is blocked and in speedy postoperative recovery.Several Olympic athletes routinely use hypnosis to enhance their performance. Inthe year 1956 the Russian Olympic team, took with them a team of 11 hypnotiststo the Melbourne Olympics and went on to win the highest number of medals ascompared to any other country.3b.Analytical therapyAnalytical hypnosis involves the search for the origin or source of the problemwhich could lie in either the subject’s present life, in-womb state or a pastlife, and enable its effective resolution through therapy. It involves filteringdown from the presenting problem that the client comes in with, to arrive at thereal issues which can often be very different from what they thought theirproblem was.Once the original source of the issue is found, the emotional charges associatedwith that problem can be released and any physical body armours related withthat initial event dissolved under hypnosis. Relationship issues, fears andphobias, relief from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) overcoming hyperhidriosis(excessive sweating) and personality based issues such as procrastination,stammering and obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD’s) are some examples thatfall into this category.A middle-aged client of mine came in for therapy wanting to heal his IBS. He hadbeen taking medicines to treat the same but relief had been temporary and thesymptoms recurred frequently whenever he was under stress. During therapy hediscovered a childhood memory under hypnotic age regression in which he wasmortified of failing at a sport that his parents really wanted him to pursue.This created a double bind in him because a part of him felt fearful of failingand didn’t want to go for the practice sessions, while the other part wanted toplease the parent and hence did not express his fear. As a result hecontinuously repressed his inner feelings and self expression. With eachsuccessive practice session as his fear surfaced, he repeatedly repressed it,causing his stomach to churn and knot up.Through the pre-talk and hypnotic interventions he realised that many yearslater, as a successful corporate executive in a leadership role, he felt asimilar abdominal churning whenever things at work got too challenging,triggering his IBS.Under hypnotic trance he recognised how he was still operating from hischildhood fears and experiencing the double bind situation at his work place. Ifhe expressed his point of view at the management meetings he was worried aboutsticking his neck out and then failing. If he didn’t voice his opinions he wasanxious about being perceived as lacking vision or not taking a stand, which asa leader he was expected to do.Through therapy his fears were resolved by healing his inner child and reframingthe source event. Within a month his IBS vanished and he discovered a new foundfreedom at work where he could openly express his opinions, confront situationswhich he was earlier averse to, and also became more expressive with hiscolleagues. It has been two years since, and the client reports that he is freeof the IBS and has not required medication during this period.Hypnosis is very effective in re-engineering negative beliefs. Often negativeexperiences create limiting beliefs and opinions in the subjects mind abouttheir own selves and others, causing them to think and behave in ways thatcreate disharmony in their lives and prevent them from harnessing their fullpotential. In such cases the old limiting beliefs must be released or rewritten,substituting them instead with empowering and positive beliefs.The meanings and interpretations that people attach to their experiences maketheir lives either happy or unhappy. This means that how people think, affectsthe quality of their lives. The power lies within them to change their thinkingand hypnosis can help in doing just that. For as Mahatma gandhi so aptly said,keep your thoughts positive because they become your words, keep your wordspositive they become your behaviour, keep your behaviour positive it becomesyour habit, keep your habits positive they become your values, keep your valuespositive, they become your destiny. So if you want to change your destiny, youcan start by changing your mind through hypnosis.Personally I also find hypnosis to be extremely useful as an adjunct therapy inconditions such as epilepsy, dyslexia, bi polar disorders and depression.Using Hypnosis For Spiritual DirectionHypnosis can also be very useful in accessing spiritual guidance from the higherplanes of wisdom and knowledge. I have had the opportunity of witnessing someremarkable experiences where clients have received guidance from otherdimensions, masters and spirit guides. This proves once again that all answerslie within us and if we search deeply enough we can go beyond the limits of ourown mind to connect with our higher wisdom.The following case demonstrates how hypnosis was employed for spiritualpurposes. Here the subject’s presenting issue was non-specific and it did notrelate to any discomfort or conflict but rather sought guidance for herspiritual growth.The subject, who I shall call Deepa, was a devoted spiritual seeker training tobe a hypnotherapist herself at the time when this session was conducted. Shewanted to explore how she could accelerate her progress on the spiritual path.After inducing a medium hypnotic trance, during the body scan Deepa found anobstruction at the site of her swadhisthana (sacral) chakra. At that point Iinstructed her to look inside the chakra to see what was causing theobstruction.S: Miniaturise yourself and enter into the obstruction to examine what lies atthat spot.D: I see a small piece of burnt wood. It’s black in colour and about 2x2centimetres in size. It appears empty but is porous and there areinterconnecting tunnels inside.S: When did this energy take shape or come to you?D: I can see a black shower. It’s like dry black rain. I have no shape. I’m justin an energy form. I carry something around me, for protection. It reflects theblack rain back, but a small drop enters me.S: How did the black drop affect you?D: My defence mechanisms have surrounded it so it couldn’t be fully absorbed norwas it completely eliminated.S: Why did it come to you?D: The attack was so powerful that my protection couldn’t push it back. Myshield got pierced and it immediately closed. It regenerates on its own.S: Who was the attack by?D: I was not alone. There were many more. I decided to take it all on me. It wasmeant to be received by more of us.S: What were you fighting for?D: It was an energy battle of some kind. I have asked for this black drop to beeliminated so many times in earlier lives also but it remains in me as areminder that I don’t stand alone. It’s not for me to always step forward andtake on the attack.... I now see a small child doing summersaults. It wears acap and clothes. It has no face.S: Has it ever had a body of its own?D: I don’t think so...it says it is Illusion.S: Yes I know it’s all illusion but how may I address you?I: (A change in the tonal quality of the voice is detected here) I am Illusion.S: Do you help or disturb Deepa with these illusions?I: I keep her entertained. I keep her moving, seeking, thinking and creating thewHY’S in her mind.S: Can you explain to me how exactly you do this?I: It’s not about explanation but experience.S: What is your purpose?I: To entertain and keep people busy.S: You keep people busy so they don’t focus their attention on what?I: On their boring existence.S: Do you wish to make life more meaningful?I: I don’t wish it, I do it. People would be too lazy otherwise. Inertia wouldhave prevailed if I was not there. So I give them a kick and keep them movingon...and searching. Would Deepa have come this far if she didn’t seek answers toher whys?S: So what lies beyond the illusion?I: TRUTH. But in your world it is fluid. There’s always solid and then there isfluid. I prefer dynamism and I make you flow.S: So what is the point of being fluid?I: The point of being fluid is going with the flow. Just go with the flow.Doesn’t flow take you to the truth? (Gestures with the hand to suggest ameandering flow)S: How can we help Deepa into the flow?I: All her problems are helping her to be in the flow. Her problems keep hermoving. How did she end up doing hypnotherapy? How did she discover the thingsthat she recently did? All because of the illusion called PROBLEM.S: Doesn’t she have the inner drive to remain in the flow?I: That is always there. There are forces that are perceived as good andattractive, but actually; they are not as perceived. Then there are those thatare painful, and are perceived as bad, but actually they provide the guidanceand the push. You must have the drive to keep flowing and aspire for that finaltarget.S: What is the final target?I: What you all aim for. What the river yearns for, to reach the ocean and tomerge with it. Till that happens you must keep flowing.S: hat does she need to do to progress?I: She likes to stand in the front and take the fire. She has to learn that it’snot just an individual journey, its team work too. You have to work as a team.S So what is her lesson more clearly?I The same lesson that she had to learn when that energy battle took place.She stood forward to get the black storm. She was hurt in it and she carriesthat reminder, that no matter how much protection she may have had, sheshouldn’t have fought alone. In a family, all responsibilities must be divided.So also in light work it’s very important to identify who is part of your team.You must stand in for each other. Help each other because everyone can’t havethe same skills. But then identifying your team is itself a great play as well.You can easily be fooled. All of it is merely entertainment, an illusion but itis for your own growth.S: What measures can we employ to identify our team?I: Your heart will always know it. Expand it and you will connect to the rightones. Otherwise you will just learn lessons.S: How can we expand our heart?I: When your heart is pure and clear, the golden light will find its reflectionin the other heart.S: Why is she so vulnerable to foreign energies?I: The distinction between helping others, and helping others without hurtingyourself, is very thin. When your heart is wide open, you have to be discerningand careful.S: So it is right to be so open?I: It’s very difficult to say what is right and wrong or positive or negativewhen you work with such energies. The line is so thin.S: How can we make sure that our protection is strong enough?I: So the shield being of white light should not be crystallised it should beMasterized. So that when Masters give you the shield they know what is right orwrong, positive or negative.S: How can we Masterize the shield?I: Just request the Masters to create the shield around you. Imagine you are ina ball of white light and then ask for the shield to be Masterized. If anynegatives are inside the shield they should be helped to go out.S: So is Masterization a technique of visualisation where the Masters put theappropriate armour on each person? will the Masters tune the intensity of eachperson’s shield according to his or her vibrations?I: Yes. Some may require more and some less. The more progress a person makes,the stronger is the attack on them. It’s not about quantity but the quality.S: Does not one reach a time, when one is powerful enough not to require ashield?I: Yes, but working with protection during growth is important.S: Does everyone, all healers specially, need a daily shield?I: It’s good to do it not only for yourself, but also for the people around youas well. Family shield must be done daily. They definitely need it. All lightworkers must do this. You’ve got your sensors a little more sensitive so youwill be able to detect these energies. But focus on your work and don’t wastetime focussing on these energies. Wear your shield and let the Masters protectyou.S: Does calling out to the Masters’ amount to wearing a shield?I: Those connected to the Masters are already protected but it is good to besafe.S: What are the instructions for Deepa now?I: She needs to be her true self first, for which she must be free of theseenergies that are blocking her inner vision. Also, practising regular inner workwill help her in establishing a much stronger connection with the divine andworking with other people will strengthen that connection.S: What is her special talent?I: GivingS: But didn’t she give too much of herself at the black shower fight. Isn’t thather lesson? when does a talent become a detriment then?I: There is a very thin lineS: How can she find that balance?I: Her connection to the Source needs to be stronger, her shield Masterized andher actions divinely guided. Only then will she find the balance. But if she isguided by her emotions, then she will not get there.Deepa emerged from the session with a feeling of great joy and peace at havinggained a deeper insight into her issues and felt a renewed sense of purpose.During the three hour session she received a lot more information about herspiritual journey through several lives and planes of existence, but I sharehere only the more immediate guidance that she received.• She understood that her so called problems were merely an illusion that kepther searching for better and more powerful methods of healing and they actuallykept her on her chosen path of being a healer.• She also grasped that she must keep flowing and not let challenges stop herfrom moving on.• She realised that she had to work as a team player and not stand apart as anindividual or a leader, like she had done in several earlier lives.• She recognised the importance of daily personal and family protection, whichwas of particular importance given the nature of her work. The concept ofMasterising the protection shield was a revelation to her.• Deepa understood that her empathetic behaviour sometimes worked against herand she decided to be more discerning in the future. She became aware thatchoosing who she works with, was very important, and if she did not choosewisely, she would continue to suffer and learn lessons until she wisened up.• Most importantly, she received a powerful reminder to do her daily spiritualpractice, balance her giving and not become overwhelmed or driven by heremotions.When we gain extraordinary insights into our everyday ordinary problems andlimitations by delving into the submerged depths of our minds we can trulyharness the power of our subconscious. Hypnosis empowers you to deep dive intothose limitless boundaries of your all- knowing inner space, to access thewisdom of pure consciousness.For me, this is perhaps the most exciting application of hypnotherapy, for itawakens multidimensional perception that can help you discover new realms ofconsciousness, learn about your soul lessons and why you have incarnated, helpyour discover skills and talents you may already have mastered in previouslives, visit the life-between-life stages to comprehend your soul’s journey anduse these insights to heal yourself at the deepest core.Why Hypnosis is the Preferred Modality• Although there are several other trance inducing modalities such as breath-work, magnetic passes, storytelling and regression bridges; the reason I preferto use hypnosis is because it can create a really good trance faster than anyother method. A skilled hypnotist can easily create a somnambulistic trance in asubject within 3-5 minutes allowing for more time to do the real therapy work.• I also find it easier to induce trance in children who lack patience and whoseattention span is short. Most children respond very well to hypnosis. If atrusting and playful rapport has been established with them during the pre-talk, they can achieve very good trance levels within a matter of minutes.• When the memories are particularly painful or if the client is uncomfortableabout revisiting them consciously, yet eager to address the deeper issues,hypnosis can be an easier and gentler route to bridge them to the originalmemory. I find this method useful in working with addicts where there is astrong tendency to hide or report occasions of substance abuse.• In cases where there is little or no verbal communication during trancebecause of some internal barriers to the subconscious exploration, use ofideomotor responses taught in hypnotherapy can be very helpful in letting thetherapist establish direct communication with the subject’s subconscious mind.Ideomotor activity occurs despite your will, involuntarily, just likekinesiology and it allows the therapist to speak directly with the subconsciousmind once the appropriate ideomotor signals are installed.In an interesting case of a lady, who had still not recovered from the posttraumatic shock of a car accident, it was ideomotor signals that facilitatedentry into a past life through which she understood how that accident was partof a soul contract that she had with the others involved in that accident.Her fears and stress related to the event was so severe, that without the helpof ideomotor signalling we may have had to abort the session until she was moreready to deal with this issue. It was ideo- signalling that helped in by-passing her critical factor and enabled her to find the answers that she wasseeking.• In cases where the client has a fear of the dark or is uncomfortable aboutkeeping his eyes closed, inducing a hypnotic trance through eye gaze fixation orother suitable methods allows the therapist to do the therapy work even whilethe subject keeps his eyes wide open, and yet maintains good trance level. Thisis even more relevant in cases where the emotional charge is missing and hencecannot be used to bridge the subject back to the source event through othermethods.• Sometimes while scanning the energy bodies if aggressive ego states areencountered it’s easier to work with such personas under hypnotic trance becauseit permits catalepsy in the subject in which the limbs are relaxed into a stateof immobility like in deeper meditative states.In ConclusionThe possibilities for healing with hypnosis are as vast as the therapist’simagination, commitment and creativity. This modality gives you the power toinvestigate and explore endless possibilities existing in the subconscious mindto heal either your own self through the use of self- hypnosis or assist othersin their healing.From the esoteric and fascinating, like speaking to body parts and organs,looking inside chakras to identify and heal blockages, removing and freeingentities and foreign energies, reconstructing a fragmented psyche and retrievingsoul parts, to the ordinary and routine such as resolving everyday conflicts,reducing stress, overcoming insomnia and experiencing deep relaxation,everything becomes possible with hypnosis in a safe and non intrusive way.No matter what you might be seeking or hoping to resolve, hypnosis can help youfind answers, just as one of my clients Nandini did. In her words, I had beensuffering from acute knee pain before I came in for therapy. It was so bad thatI would wake up in the mornings with terrible pain and my knees would creak. Butnow, that pain has miraculously vanished. I am now cured of this pain that hadplagued me for so long.Also the sudden and acute shoulder pain that I episodically experienced hasdecreased substantially after a hypnotherapy session during which an incidentfrom one of my past lives was recovered and healed, in which I was severelybeaten up and dragged by my shoulder.In the multiple sessions with my therapist, I have undergone several hypnoticregressions into past lives, experienced spiritual hypnotherapy and energyreleasements. During these experiences, I discovered information about some ofthe relationships that were troubling me and learnt how to take care of them. Iwas also able to understand and dissociate from the various unreasonable fearsand anxieties that I earlier suffered from.I have undergone a major shift in attitude towards a major lesson that my soulmust learn. I now recognize my life patterns and these have helped meunderstand, what I should do, in order to dissolve my karmic baggage.I have also discovered what some of my key soul lessons are in this lifetime.And thankfully, I have glimpsed my soul state and probably met my soul guidetoo. I have been able to enrich most of my important relationships as a resultof this therapy work.The efficacy of this healing modality is enhanced by the fact that it is nonintrusive and yet has powerful healing effects. As noted parapsychologist Dr.Hans Holzer4 says, it is quite superior to conventional chemical agents becauseit leaves no residue, has no side effects, and reaches the very centre, whereall activities originate.Hypnotherapy gives you the power to change your limiting beliefs and re-engineer your life to fulfil your dreams. It helps you discover your potentialsso you can experience limitless success. It opens your mind to create harmonyand intimacy in your relationships. It enhances your performance andproductivity. It allows you to heal your body without medication or invasiveprocedures. And it can also help you discover, what your soul purpose might bein this lifetime.To my mind, this is undoubtedly a master healing modality which can put each onein touch with the powerful field of divine consciousness in them. JustAs twentieth Century psychic and medical clairvoyant, Edgar Cayce5 did, byputting himself into a sleep-like state by lying down on a couch, closing hiseyes, and folding his hands over his stomach. In this state of relaxation andmeditation, he was able to place his mind in contact with all time and space theuniversal consciousness, also known as the super-conscious mind. From there, hecould respond to questions as broad as, “what are the secrets of the universe?”and “what is my purpose in life?” to as specific as, “what can I do to help myarthritis?” and “How were the pyramids of Egypt built? It is through thesereadings that he was able to help and heal thousands of people across the world.With Hypnosis, you too can aspire to do the same.If you are enamoured by the mind body connections and wish to explore theunexplored realms of the subconscious mind as Cayce did, or if you yearn tounderstand this phenomena called life and why humans act and behave as they do,hypnotherapy is an essential tool that you must have in your healing toolbox.Suzy is a Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, Wellness Mentor, Spiritual Teacher,Channel and Author.

We learn everyday new experiences from our lives.It teaches us the art of becoming a better human every day. We have our own setof patterns, which we acquire from our parents, from our environment since weare born. These patterns are also the conditioning we make in our minds aboutlife through the experiences of others in our lives. As we grow, we start havingour own experiences in life and with the awareness these patterns andconditionings start breaking and new, better thoughts start making our newrealities. This new reality which we make ourselves becoming more aware andconscious about our life purpose and the spiritual being within us gives a newperspective towards others and ourselves.In my journey of Life, it has been very experiential. Initially I used to feelthat why I have been chosen to live a harsh circumstantial life. But graduallywith time and awareness I came to know that this is the way I am choosing it.The day I decided for myself that enough of drama, now I want to live a happyand prosperous life, things changed. The more we think of lack in our life, themore we manifest the same. Always count on your blessings and see howbeautifully Universe unfolds the mystery to support you in different ways. Theonly thing you have to do is make right decision at right time. Rest all istaken care of always.My journey with Hypnotherapy started way back in 2009. Before that I alreadyknew that there is something more to what I was doing. Something I really wantedto do for the humanity and myself. Hypnotherapy changed my life in a way thatwhile I was learning, I started realizing how much I have stored in myself asthe emotions like anger, guilt, fear etc. Guilt and fear, according to me arethe two major emotions that can create lot of unhealed emotions and blockages inour system. The more I started to learn that life is a flow, at certain pointhow we react to a certain situation is all based on our awareness andconsciousness at that point. How we behave at the age of 15, we don’t behavesame way at the age of 25. Why ? Because, we have mature thoughts at the elderage and more understanding for the situation. So, it is useless to keepregretting on the past events and experiences. Rather, learn the lessons frompast events and move on for a better life with new and better experiences. Allthe events happening in our lives are created by our own thoughts. We are thecreator of our reality. If you don’t like your reality then understand how canyou change your reality? Answer is very simple, by monitoring your thoughts andby thinking only about what you want in your life, rather than wasting yourprecious time in thinking about what you don’t want. How can we monitor ourthoughts? The answer is again very simple, here comes in picture the tools likeSELF HYPNOSIS, through which you can give positive affirmations to yourself andbecome self-dependent to change your reality.The ProcessHypnosis is a state of altered awareness in which access is available to thesub- conscious mind. The process is initiated by an overload of message units,leading to break down of the inhibitory processes of the critical mind. This inturn triggers the flight-fight mechanism and ultimately results inhyper-suggestible state, providing access to the sub-conscious mind.Body-Mind CorrelationIn a crisis, the mind perceives the danger and the body responds by letting theautonomous nervous system takes over. Originally, the thought comes and then itgets converted into an emotion, then the emotion (energy in motion) getsconverted into action in the physical body. This is simple explanation how ourbody takes action at every thought. The mind again is divided into two parts,Conscious mind and the sub-conscious mind. It has been found that the consciousmind is 10-12% and the sub-conscious mind is 88-90% of the total mind.Originally, the primitive man functioned completely by instincts. He did nothave inhibitions. With the passage of time, man started developing the abilityto think. Amongst the first things, the man thought about was survival. Man cameto the realization that he did not have to act on every impulse that confrontedhim. He then started to develop CONSCIOUS CONTROL. At this point, the fightmechanism started to become anxiety. He started to feel in his body. The modernway to look at this is action vs. reaction. The flight mechanism also developeda modern way of coping. This can be seen as repression vs. depression. Themodern flight mechanism is depression.Model Of The MindWhen an infant is first brought into the world, he/she does not have the logic,reason or inhibitions. To make their needs known, the child uses the moreprimitive mechanisms. The child has a more of primitive mind, with flight-fightmechanism. The baby is born with only two fears, fear of falling and fear ofloud noises. Everything else is learned by the associations and identifications.From the age, zero to eight years, the child develops a library or a store houseof these associations and identifications, he learns that some of these are goodas in positive associations and some are bad as in negative associations. Theseassociations form the pillars of our conditioning which in turn govern ourresponses to life’s situations. Between the ages of eight and twelve, the childstarts developing the logic and reason. The child is capable of taking decisionsand developing will power. This becomes the CONSCIOUS MIND, which represents10-12% of the total mind power. The SUB-CONSCIOUS MIND is made up of remaining88-90% of the total mind power. It includes the modern memory (where the libraryof associations is stored) and the primitive mind.Age Regression In HypnotherapyAge regression is basically based on the model that everything that has everhappened to us in our lives is recorded in our minds like a recorder. Ageregression therapy operates from the assumptions that many of our problems as anadult stem from traumatic experiences that happened to us early in life and thatwere responded from conscious memory by the sub-conscious defence mechanism ofrepression. Such a model is commonly held among traditionally trainedpsychologists schooled in the Freudian tradition.For example, in my practice, there was a client, whom I should name Pragati,came for the reason that she was very scared of going to hospitals. Even thoughshe was at the best of her health, she had the feeling that she will not livefor long and will not survive. For no reasons this girl would not go to hospitaleven to visit a close relative. She came for the session for her problem thatwhen she is so healthy and fit, why does she feel that she will not survive andwhat was the reason for so much of hatred and fear to go to the hospital. UnderHypnosis, she regressed to the age when she was newly born and due to someallergy during the birth, she was kept in incubater for one week. Then she sawthat her parents were being told by the doctor that this girl will not survive.But due to good medical help and the will of the parents and the child, the girlsurvived. But the sharp comment of the doctor became a memory for the girl thatthere are less chances of survival for her. So throughout her life till thelatest age of 28, she has been thinking the same way without any ill health. Andin the next session, she discovered that she was by mistake locked in a washroomof a hospital at the age of three years. Already having the belief system thatshe will not survive( from previous experience) and spent few hours locked inhospital washroom, with all pungent smells of medicines, got these two traumasaffecting her so much. After the successful session of Age Regression, shebecame absolutely fine and few affirmations were given to her to have Faith inthe process of life.Another very profound example of healing through Age regression in my clinicalpractice is of a girl, age 37, whom I should name Parul. She had a veryindifferent relationship with her mother. She never used to be comfortabletalking to her mother and they never shared any much of physical touch. She usedto feel that her mother doesn’t love her and she doesn’t love her mother either.The hatred was becoming strong day by day which of course neither Parul, nor hermother were liking. They were suggested to visit me by a common friend. When Ispoke to the mother, she had her own part of the story to tell and when I spoketo Parul, she had her own story. Even though I counseled them separately butcommon issue came up between both of them was that what may they were trying topatch up with each other, nothing was working. I suggested Parul to go first forthe session because she was more receptive to my suggestions. Under Hypnosis,Parul regressed to her age of four, probably her fourth Birthday party, whereshe saw her mother being ready for the party and suddenly she saw her uncleentering the room and they both became intimate. Parul, in deep hypnotic statecould feel the pain and she hated her mother for doing this. Then she being asmall child at that point of time, did not understand and went to her father andtold him what she saw. Her father asked his wife what child is telling so mothermanipulated things and went off. But the next day her mother brought all heranger up and beaten Parul with broom. This was very traumatic for Parul toexperience in Hypnotic state again as if it was happening again. But that is howthe therapy works. With age she have had forgotten the incident but the hatredfor her mother was becoming stronger day by day. After the session and therapy,Parul got the wisdom and she accepted the situation with a mature understanding.She didn’t become loving towards her mother but yes, she was at peace withherself.The memories which we register in our minds in early childhood, they become veryprominent beliefs in later age. Once the right approach has been taken up by thetherapist to reach to the conclusion what age of the client is the trauma comingfrom. Once that trauma is re experienced by the client and the therapy has beendone, it can lead to a better life.Past Life RegressionPast life regression is a technique, a therapeutic process that uses Hypnosis torecover the memories of past lives stored in the sub-conscious mind. Past liferegression therapy is typically undertaken either in pursuit of a spiritualexperience or in a psychotherapeutic setting. Past life sessions can proved tobe excellent if the subject (client) is receptive and the therapist’s intentionsare very clear to guide the client through the therapeutic process. There aremany blocks that can be cleared from the mind of the client with these sessionsby making them understand the reason of what is happening in current life with adifferent perspective.A client came to my clinic for a session of healing and therapy with thecomplaint of having severe pain in shoulders for no reasons. I should name her,Srishti. She had been taking medication for cervical thinking that this pain wasdue to that. But she was not getting relieved at all. A friend of hers suggestedher to go for an alternate healing modality and referred me to Srishti. She wasa young girl of 22years. When asked that since when does she had this pain. Shecould only recall the age of 10, when the pain started and it had beenaggravating by every year. While counseling and talking to her, I discoveredthat there was no physical injury or damage in the shoulders. I took her for thesession and under deep Hypnosis, she regressed to a past life where she sawherself as a middle aged woman working as a laborer in a building underconstruction. She kept on seeing few details and then I guided her to witnessthat major event which will give her the wisdom about this pain. She saw thatone day she was working on the site and suddenly, a huge wall fell on her backand her last thoughts were that “ this pain is terrible, it is killing me”. Thenshe was taken to the Higher Self to get the wisdom and therapy was donecompletely on her. For another one week she had to continue medication for mildpain but after that she got absolutely cured from the pain. There was no furtherpain. The beauty of the session was that sub-conscious mind exactly opened thefile or folder of that past life which had got the wisdom for her to getrelieved from the pain.Another case I would like to share is in 2011. There was a couple being marriedfor good fourteen years but shared a very cold relationship. The wife came to mefor the therapy as she was at the verge of getting collapsed with the situationsin her life. I should name her Divya. When she came for the therapy she hadtried all her best ways to maintain the marriage. She had been staying in ajoint family and had one daughter. When I asked her that could she recall goodmemories with her husband, she was so frustrated coping up with the situationsthat she had no answer but cried a lot. Release of emotional charge is very goodbefore or in between the therapy. Divya had a major complaint that her husbandbehaved very different with other people and different with her. She herselfsaid that her husband is a very good human being with no bad habits according toher, he was a good son and a very good brother. But when it used to come down tothe relationship with her, he was very indifferent. She also explained that shealways see hatred in her husband’s eyes for her, which was a very strongstatement. I never wanted to manipulate her mind and reactions so I was simplylistening to her complaints without making any judgments. Divya was thenregressed and in very deep Hypnosis, she saw herself in eEngland, in very oldtimes. She could not make out the year though but the dresses she was mentioningand the chariots etc. she was visualizing were all pointing towards the factthat she was visualizing the very old era. She saw herself in a very beautifulenglish attire and like a rich lady. Then she visualized herself falling in lovewith some average status guy. In next few minutes, she could recognize the guy,it was her current life husband. They were madly in love with each other. Thenshe progressed in that lifetime and saw that there was disharmony between bothof them because of money. Divya, in that lifetime was a rich woman but this manwas not that wealthy. But the man loved her madly; he was ready to do anythingfor her. I guided Divya to progress to the major event of that past life whichhad a major impact on her current life. She saw that she had started likinganother man in that lifetime, who was very rich. She was in a way cheating onher boy friend. The last event that she witnessed was that she sat in a chariotof the new guy and eloped with him. While she was leaving the city, her currentlife husband encountered her and was very angry with her. He confronted her andshe very rudely told him the truth that she would prefer money over love. Theguy shattered and in his eyes Divya could witness the same hatred that she usedto feel in her current life’s Husband. Then Divya saw her death scene and herlast thoughts were of guilt and regret for what she did with her current lifehusband. Then she was guided to her Higher Self to get the wisdom why she sawthat particular past life. The therapy was done and she got the wisdom andimproved the relationship with few affirmations given to her for acceptance ofthe situation and moving ahead in life with a new perspective of life. Thebeauty of the process was that the wife got the wisdom from the session but thehusband’s awareness also shifted after the healing.Another case I would like to share is of Anita, age 28 (name changed forprivacy) She came to me for a healing session for relationship issue. She was inrelationship with a guy since five years. The guy was three years younger toher. She was madly in love with him and he was also equally in love with her.The problem arose when she started earning better than him and the guy couldn’ttake it. The male ego of the guy was making the relationship go haywire. She wasvery upset but wanted to save the relationship. While counseling her, I noticedthat the girl was very insecure about taking decision about this relationship.She already had a heartbreak few months back and now she was trying to hold onto the guy. Under deep Hypnosis, she regressed first to her early childhooddays, where her whole life as child was spent in lack of love and compassion.She witnessed two incidents in early childhood, which were very evident to makeout that she was a child without being loved by anyone the way she wanted. Eventhough her parents would have loved her to their capacity and understanding ofthe emotion but she felt the lack of love and created a void for herself. Atthat point of therapy, I guided her to heal the INNER CHILD personalities ofhers that surfaced and integrated those inner children with the current aged,mature Anita. Then my concern was to guide her about the current relationshipissue. The main concern was that her previous relationship also broke because ofmoney. In that relationship, her boyfriend was financially much better than herso used to put her down always and in current relationship, the guy was feelinginsecure that she earned almost double the money he earned. So in the furthersession, she regressed to a past life where she saw herself as a queen of somekingdom and due to some circumstances had to get married to a not so rich guy.She saw herself suffering because of lack of money and lack of love in that pastlife. When she was guided to see her last day of that life, she saw herselfdying in misery and the last thoughts were that she had a miserable life becauseshe married in love with a not so rich guy. So two prominent thoughts that moneyis very important and love and money are related. Then she was guided to herHigher self to get the wisdom from that lifetime. After the session, few dayslater, she got married to the same person without any insecurity about love andmoney.The more I have taken up these sessions the more I have realized that Life is abeautiful journey and every person, every situation that comes in our lives isan opportunity to learn and grow. Even though when we are in any circumstanceand we see no hope at that point of time, there is already a bigger and a betterplan been made by the Universal force of energy. We just need to trust in theprocess of life.The TipI am giving a few affirmations for healing below. I have believed inaffirmations and experienced a major shift in mine and other’s lives.

I looked aroundin the surroundings for any smoke coming up but there wasn’t any. He had come toour center in Nasik from Mumbai for a 2 days workshop on Past-Life RegressionTherapy. And he was getting the clear smell of smoke for about seven hours. Thatwas the day when the Mantralay i.e. the government secretariat building hadcaught fire in Mumbai!Sumeet, in one of the sessions, saw his boss asking him to attend an interviewfrom their head-office in the U.S. And he was asked to report immediately tohead a project undertaken by the company. And it happened in reality exactlyafter ten days.Yes this is one of the bonus effects of PLRT sessions! Time and space travel. Itjust happens if we are ready for it...We heard loud shrieks on the staircase! It was time for my next appointment atthe NewAge World Wellness center in Delhi. The door was flung open and a boyabout five feet tall dashed in, walked past us and started exploring,scrutinizing everything that came his way. Following him the parents came, tostop him, but in vain! As he moved further I simply slid a sketchbook in frontof him and some color pastels. And that did the trick. He sat glued to it forabout twenty minutes, which gave us enough time to speak to his parents. Sujeet,a fifteen-year-old boy suffers from Autism, a neuro-developmental disorder thatcreates an imbalance in the mental growth. In school Sujeet frequently sketcheda car and violently scribbled red and orange strokes on it. On asking what itwas he would say, “The car is on fire. Dehradun. Traffic jam.” In school hewould be assigned to write a story and he would again sketch the same pictureand that’s when the school consulting psychologist recommended him to consultme.I guided him into prolonged sessions of breath work and color therapy, which isused to release, pent up emotions and to balance chakras, as PLRT was difficultdue to his inconsistency. But he repeatedly sketched the same pictures and alsoa bus with the same strokes of red and orange which validated the fact that itwas his pattern. He might have died in this manner repeatedly.After the sessions there was a remarkable change in his behavioral pattern, themost important change being that he became sure of what he wanted, which was oneof the intentions with which his parents had come to me.Yes, we live lifetimes of patterns, which need to be broken to bring abouttransformation. The sessions brought about changes in him but what is theintention of the soul when such a differently abled child chooses a life likethis, to learn his own lessons? Teach them? And his parents are they in a karmiccycle completing some incompletions? To gain a deeper understanding of suchkarmic relationships the parents also need to go through the sessions. It canreveal to them deeper insights about the relationship than they can consciouslycomprehend. This helps them to open their hearts and be with more compassionwith the child and with others!PLRT has a profound effect not only on differently abled children but also onpersons suffering from depression, mood swings and such other psychologicaldisorders. Breath-work or Re-birthing Process and Inner-child-work can beeffectively used along with PLRT to release unknown blockages that we carry notonly to heal the issues but also to bring about ascension on a soul level,mental level and physical level.Fifteen year old Nina was guided to her past life where she saw herself as awoman running away from a few men and she was actually eating papers of herhouse ownership. She then jumped into a well and died. Later on, her parentsshared that she had a habit of eating papers and would consume an entirenotebook. During that time she would faint for no apparent reason. This too wascured completely after the sessions.PLRT can be used to get answers to the ‘why me.’ It gives us an understandingand facilitates healing of issues related to health, relationships, fears andphobias, all that keeps us from leading a fuller life in the present.We are not our body, our thoughts and our emotions. Our body is in fact ourfirst environment. It is the carrier of our soul. We are the soul, the spark,and the particle of consciousness or the divine source. The soul manifests intothe earth plane or many such realities, in order to experience. Through theseexperiences we learn lessons and ascend till we reach to our godliness. Beforecoming down on earth, we pre-plan that life time, choose the parents who willteach us the lessons we have decided to learn in that lifetime. We also comehere to teach whatever we have learned and to enjoy what we have created. And wealso come here to enjoy creating! The lessons we learn are those of trust,patience, forgiveness, faith, acceptance, unconditional love and many more whicheventually lead us to opening of the heart, to be with compassion to one andall. So, we are the sum total of all our experiences from many life times.At the time of birth, the soul enters the chosen body and that is the time whenour entire history or past data is inserted into the body that we have chosen,just like a chip with data is inserted into a gadget. This data exists in everycell of our body, known as “cellular memory”. We choose lessons to be learnt inevery lifetime. But when we come down here, we forget to learn the lessons andthere begins the blame game --- of blaming others, god, destiny or our karmas.‘Karma’ is a Sanskrit word, which simply means action. As Jesus Christ sayssaid, ‘As ye sow, so shall ye reap’ or we know that ‘every action has an equaland opposite reaction’. But Karma is not a reward or a punishment system. We sowwhat we reap because of the guilt that we carry. It is we who punish or rewardourselves for our negative or positive actions. As a result what we didyesterday shapes our today, and what we do today shapes our tomorrow.The ProcessBy reincarnating we are completing our karmic cycles with other souls, though weactually ought to learn lessons that the other person was/is trying to teach us.Every experience is trying to teach us lessons and with every lesson learned,the soul is ascending to a higher plane of consciousness. Hence we need to takeup the responsibility of our life and see what each experience, each event, eachperson is trying to teach us. PLRT helps us to work on ourselves, to find thelessons, and free our selves.RelationshipsIt is relationships that teach us lessons. They help us to evolve.Simran, a forty year old, had issues with her mother-in-law. Initial trivialarguments between them blew up into a lot of anger and resentment. Themother-in-law controlled the finances of the family and when she gave Simranmoney even for household expenses, she would literally throw the money in frontof her. During PLRT sessions Simran saw herself as a queen in an ancientlifetime, wearing a gown, and tied to a pole in a market place. She couldliterally see flames coming up toward her. She was being burned to death and shecould literally feel the heat of the flames. On being instructed to go toanother significant moment of her life, she saw herself walking along with theking, followed by a retinue going through a narrow lane. The path way was madeof stones with small houses on either side. An old lady suddenly came out of oneof the houses and begged before the queen. The arrogant queen kicked the oldlady and moved on. “You will come into my hands and I will show you,” said theold lady. When she looked into the eyes of the old lady, Simran could clearlysee the face of the mother-in-law. In another incident of that lifetime, she sawherself and the king enjoying themselves in the well-protected fortress and thesubjects were left to protect themselves from an attack of the neighbouringcountry. It was after that incident that the enraged subjects pulled theruthless queen into the market square and burnt her alive.She could now understand why her mother-in-law treated her in that manner whichhelped to forgive her and their relationship started improving. But that was notall. We worked on their relationship from different angles which made her awareof the larger picture and she got her answers to her ‘why me’. Her healthissues, the root of which were the burning of her body, were released as well.The sessions taught her to take responsibility of all that happened in her life.These sessions work on a deeper level and help to release blockages. Thetransformation within facilitates a transformation on the outside, whichincludes situations, persons, places and everything around the person. Whatanyone says or does is not important. What is important is what we need to learnfrom them. By letting go of the blame game, Simran learned the lessons ofacceptance, patience and above all compassion.In relationship issues we find that situations are repeated and we realize thatit has actually become a pattern. PLRT helps to bring about a higherunderstanding as we now see the bigger picture. Every troublesome relationshipcan be reformed into a love-based relationship. The process helps us to forgive,accept and then love the other person. We realize that most of the people in ourlife have been with us in other lifetimes too. The previous life explains why wefeel instant attraction or resentment towards certain people. The ‘why me’dissolves when one sees ‘what I did’.HealthRe-living is relieving.When Varsha’s oncologist broke the news of her tumor being malignant, her familyand friends were devastated. In a PLRT session, she saw herself as a butterflythat was caught by a bearded man and shoved into a sack that he carried on hisback. “I can actually feel the sack swinging as he is walking and it’s painful,”she said. He reached a hut and forgot all about the butterfly, only to open thesack two days later. He simply picked the half-dead, de-hydrated butterfly andthrew it away. The butterfly just died. When I asked Varsha to find similaritiesbetween that life and this, it dawned on her that she felt captivated and stuckin the sack and she had an exactly similar feeling in her current job. She wasat that time at the peak of her career and had worked hard to be there. Butduring the session she realized that her body was signaling her to make changesand PLRT helped her to take the hard decision to resign and to do things thatshe wanted to do now. Thereafter, her body responded well to the treatment andshe was healed!In another session she experienced astral travel and connected to Lord Krishna.Rays of bright light flooded from his hands to her body and the vibrations ofthe energy were felt in the entire room. This was an overwhelming experience forboth of us. She now works as a freelancer and has authored a few books. She isnow her own master. “I feel liberated now that I am living life on my own terms”was her response, months later.PLRT helps us to get rid of health issues. The memories of traumas are stored inthe cells of the body. This ‘cellular memory’ is the reason why body createsdiseases, deformities, birthmarks and scars. They come from our previouslifetimes. Even when the tumors or injuries or diseases are healed, they canrecur due to these memories. Also, the body speaks to us. We simply need tocommunicate and find out what the body is saying. This therapy works very wellon cases where diagnosis is not possible. Even cases where there has beenrecurring sprains, when people are not able to conceive, migraines, arthritisetc. have been cured by PLRT.By way of this therapy, healing can be instant or due to the blockage released,the process of healing begins and actual healing happens after some time. Byre-living the trauma, the symptoms disappear. Even repressed traumas of thislifetime are released through this process.During a free group session for the NAB students, Rashmi, a 22 year oldinstantly connected to a past life. In the Indo-Pak partition era, she sawherself as a young female standing on the roof of her house. People were killingeach other all around and a mob armed with swords entered her house. She camedown and saw bloodshed all over the house and her near and dear ones had beenmassacred. “I don’t want to see anything” she said, and a sword struck her too.After the session, her eyesight did not return but she felt as if a big weighthad come off her shoulders.Every person going through these sessions feels the removal of a burden. Yes,the last thoughts determine the next lifetime. And they profoundly affect thenext lifetime.AbundanceManish, 35 year-old seemed confused and felt helpless when he came to me. Inspite of a lot of hard work, he did not get success in his career. Going to theroot cause, he saw himself as a 50 year-old male sitting in a cold cave. Threemen with faces hidden by rugs entered the cave and stabbed him on the right sidein the chest. He shouted aloud as he actually felt the acute pain in his chestas the blade of the knife pierced through his flesh. Surprisingly he had alwayscomplained of a pain in the right side of his chest to the extent that hisrelatives teased him of having a heart on the wrong side. After this session,his life changed completely and he came out of the stagnation that he wasexperiencing in all areas of life, especially in his career. In one of thesessions, he connected to his father’s soul and received messages from him. Thismade him feel very light, relieved and empowered.The sessions helped us to resolve issues related to abundance and remove hurdlesin career because they help release the energy blockages that keep us fromenjoying abundance.Concentration and FocusAmit, a 9 year-old boy was unable to sit still or indulge in any activity evenfor 5 minutes. There was some kind of an uneasiness and fear in his eyes. In asession, he saw himself as a middle-aged man, clad in white, being trampled byan elephant. Even after he died, the enraged elephant kept kicking his body.After going through the process, the boy was much relieved and became calm andpeaceful. He is now able to focus on his activities.Yes, PLRT has been used successfully for children and elders with an unexplaineduneasiness and an inability to focus on matters. Children have a tendency tosleep a lot after the session but a lot of healing takes place on a subconsciouslevel even in sleep.Fears and PhobiasMany persons have irrational fears and phobias and after reliving the rootcause, they can be effectively released.Surekha, an English teacher had a fear of snakes, so much so that she couldn’teven utter the word nor see a picture of it. In a PLRT session she saw herselfas a soldier on horseback passing through a jungle. He fell into a pit wherethere were innumerable snakes. With snakes wriggling all over him, he took hislast breath. Towards the end of the session she asked me, “How do I know my fearhas gone?” I subsequently guided her to go into the pit again and lo and behold!She said, “I can see snakes all over me but I don’t feel the fear now.” When Ichecked with her after a week, she did not feel the fear any longer.Root cause of a fear of height, water, fire, closed spaces can be traced to pastlife traumatic experiences and going through the process helps to release them.Generally these fears are traced to traumatic death due to falling from aheight, drowning in water, burning in fire, death in an enclosed space etc.During such a traumatic death event when there is an emotional charge and energyblock is created and this emotional charge is carried to the next birth, whichinstigates these fears. These blockages not only create the fears and phobiasbut also stop us from progressing in many areas of life. They can be effectivelyreleased on very deep levels through the process of reliving.The most important fear that is released during this process is the fear ofdeath, death of loved ones and our own death because when we see ourselves dyingand yet existing, we know that we always are.Talents, Abilities and Purpose of LifeNikita was a middle-aged woman who did not enjoy her profession any longer andfelt extreme uneasiness. In a session she saw herself as a painter and her lifechanged thereafter. She now pursues her talent not only as a hobby but has madeit a full- fledged profession and the uneasiness she felt has gone awaycompletely.Through the PLRT process, past life talents, abilities, and wisdom can beretrieved. Moreover the purpose of our life can be found which can help us tolive a meaningful, joyous and fulfilling life.Along with PLRT, Breath-work or Re-birthing can be effectively used to releaseunknown blockages and remove depression, negative thinking and death urge.Inner-child work releases blockages created due to traumatic events inchildhood.Anita, in her late thirties conceived sixteen years after marriage when the rootcause was traced to an abuse during childhood. Seema, who was addicted tosmoking could stop it completely after the root cause was traced to the time ofher birthing when she was not handled carefully and made comfortable after birthas her mother had a schizophrenic attack and the doctors got busy attending toher. During inner- child work, the abundant inner-child during the traumaticevents is retrieved and assimilated into the self to get a feeling ofcompleteness and wholeness.There is no side effect of these sessions but we certainly experience bonuseffects. Though starting with the intention of releasing one or two core issues,a lot more issues come up and are released during the sessions, as they are allinterlinked to the prominent core issues.On a larger canvas, PLRT is contributing in the promotion of global peace aspeople see themselves born in different nationalities and religions, whichincreases their understanding of others and brings about a feeling of oneness.PLRT also makes us open to all possibilities and helps us to be with peace andcalmness. Every reincarnation we remember increases our comprehension ofourselves as we are.The Tip“If you dont believe in karma and reincarnation, don’t worry,probably you will in your next life.” - Dr. Bruce Goldberg*All the case studies mentioned in this article are with prior permissions fromthe respective persons and their names have been changed to safeguard theirprivacy.Smita Wankhade is a Breath Worker, a Past life Regressionist, and a Reikimaster.

Through herhealing sessions, people have found relief from issues, which were preventingthem from living a fuller life. Each of them found the purpose of their life andbeen able to balance their material and spiritual life.www.pastliferegressionindia.com [http://www.pastliferegressionindia.com/]"},{"pageContent":" Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 3.02.11 pm.png [../images/00057.jpeg] CELLULAR RHYTHMS IN REGRESSION – A NEWPARADIGM TO HEALING AND INTEGRATION Aasha Warriar The rhythm which is necessary for our cure is brought about by bringing thecirculation of the blood into a certain rhythm and speed -Hazrat Inayat KhanBe it classical, folk, reggae, country, rock, or any other genre and whether ithas lyrics or is plain instrumental; I realized that one of the biggestinfluencers of our belief system is the music we listen to. And if we listen toa particular genre over and over again, neural pathways get generated and theemotional reactions get etched in our sub-conscious. Eventually, theseneuro-pathways become the story of our lives, creating and re-creating ourrealities to match these imbibed beliefs.Whilst working on cases and understanding the human mind and programming, Istarted working with the music people listened to and once again the resultswere astonishing.People who were deeply affected by sad, emotional songsdeveloped depressive reaction patterns and helplessness. Continuous hard rockand songs with loud banging music created a trance-like state and leave peoplevulnerable to influences of belief systems that may not even be their own.Basic theory:There is an innate rhythm within our body, its cells and with the environmentaround us. Our Thoughts, emotions, energy and the Physical Body which arecontrolled by the mind need to function in alignment for the body to be at ease.If this alignment is disturbed at any level, there is dis-ease. The endogenouslygenerated rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in our physiological process in the cellsalthough, it can be modulated by the external environment.we already know thatthere are clear patterns of brain wave activity, hormone production, cellregeneration and other biological activities linked to this daily cycle and iscontrolled by our states of consciousness. Therefore, cellular memory can betapped by focusing on the rhythm of this alignment to bring up positive as wellas traumatic images leading into regression for healing at all levels.Since ancient times, music has been used to put people in touch with theiremotions which are the cornerstones of our existence. At a broader level it issaid that music tones the soul. And at base body level, it has been noticed thatthe cell frequency changes with change in external rhythm and music. Enliveningmusic causes the cells to vibrate at a frequency which is very different fromthat of melancholy or sad melodies and these are all different from peacefulmantras. The mind and body are so deeply connected that our own beliefs affectthe way in which these emotions get embedded in the body cells.Research has shown that all sounds and especially human sound affect the chakrasand aura. Since, a thought is eventually stored in the body by virtue of theemotion it generates and the energy carried by that emotion, it is possible towork on any of these three layers to bring about a change in the physical bodyand bring it back to harmony.I found that clients were able to auto-regress into events that are relevant tothe issue which bothered them the most during that time. Once the imaginativebridge was established, the somatic could be brought up and regression sessioncompleted. Since the work began with energy-work and ended with regression, Ihave learnt to close the session with the opposite frequency of music andemotion - eventually collapsing the anchors.Excerpts from my book:Case I: Neena (Inner Child work)This case has been a wonderful experience for me as a therapist because it wasone of the first experiments of how healing with music works.Neena is a dear friend and on that day was feeling a bit low and felt as if shewas missing something in life. There was no particular thought pattern orailment. So, I asked her to be relaxed and take a few breathsT: Notice now that a song will begin to play in your mind…simply tell me whichsong it is…C: Strange, I would never think of this song…anyway, it is “zindagi ke safarmein guzar jaate hain jo maquaam, woh phir nahi aate...”[This means - so many opportunities / events pass us by in life and once gone,they never come back.]T: Which are the words that strike you the most?C: “Wohphirnahiaate…” [I.e. they never come back]T: Just repeat these words till you feel it in the body…C: “Wohphirnahiaate…,wohphirnahiaate…” (I notice tears)T: what is happening Neena?C: It’s funny; maybe I miss my college days and my friends, I am not sure…T: It’s okay, just be there.Here, Neena started crying and spoke about her college days when she wasspontaneous, carefree and did what her heart desired and now she has changed somuch, she is stressed most of the time.T: Just repeat the words one more time, Neena and let me know if there are anyimages that come up.C: I can see myself in the Biology laboratory in my college…(she smiles)T: How old are you?C: 18 years.T: What is happening there?C: I am with my friends and we are having a lot of fun…it is such a carefreeenvironment…we are laughing, enjoying…hmm…T: Can you bring 18 year old Neena with you here?C: No, she refuses to come with me...she says “this is the best time of life andit may never come back”Here, I did an intervention and worked with the inner child simply holding herhands until, Neena finally said, “I miss this part of me”She was crying just recognizing that she was still living in college and hence,resonated with the words of the song.When I asked her to integrate this part with herself, a strange thing happened.C: She doesn’t fit into me...actually I need to merge with her....she seemsbigger than me, more confident and she is inviting meAnd before I could say anything, she hugged 18 year old Neena; “this wasmissing, this was missing”T: (Pausing, giving enough time) what is happening?C: Now she is growing up to my age and I feel as if my spontaneity is back, I ammyself again - we are walking out of the college together and being the woman Iam today…(she hugs herself )After she had settled, I asked her to listen to the song playing in her headnow... it was another song the lyrics of which represented being a spontaneous,lively and happy woman.Neena opened her eyes with a sparkling smile and zest in life that had beenmissing.Case 2: Cynthia (using Past Life)Cynthia is a young, beautiful woman for whom life has been quite a puzzle. Herreason to meet me was the issue of her marriage.The client had been through adivorce and was about to re-marry when she realized that the man was duping her.He was not only married, but also had a family and had hidden the details fromher.Cynthia was planning her wedding and this discovery came as a rude shock toher and the family. The wedding was called off and the bitter experience causedher a lot of grief.The words kept echoing in her space: Marriage causes grief.with this background,Cynthia lay down on the couch in the therapy room.T: Hear that a song is playing in your mind and tell me what it is that youhear…C: Actually, here is an image of me and my sister cycling in the park and itsdrizzling...and I am listening to music…T: What are you listening to?C: Kuchh khaas hai kuchh paas hai, kuchh ajnabee ehsaas hai, kuchh dooriyaannazdeekiyaan kuchh hass padi tanhaiyaan…[Meaning: it is something special and near, a strange feeling, some sort ofdistant nearness, loneliness has smiled]T: Hmm…what are the images that come up when you repeat this in your mind?C: I am in a battlefield…T: Okay…and what is happening?C: I am falling off my horse…I am hurt…and it is drizzling… (I begin to feelgoose bumps)T: Are you badly injured?C: Yes…I am dying…T: What are you thinking…are there any last thoughts?C: Yes… I wish I had told her that I love her...”T: Told whom?C: Naazneen…my fiancé…I had told her that we can never get married…T: And the reason is…?C: That I am the king…I have battles and battles to fight…if I die, she will bein grief, just like my mother…(sighs)T: Hmm…what happened to your mother?C: My father died in a battle…I have seen them crying and then living in grief…T: Who is ‘them’?C: My mother…my step-mother…my step-sister and all the people in the kingdom…butI did not cry.T: How old are you at your father’s death?C: 15T: And you are not crying…?C: No, I am the crown prince…the next king…I cannot be weak. [Long pause as ifobserving the scene of his father’s death] I have decided that I will notmarry…it brings grief to the survivor. (This time the voice is very assertive)A decision made in an emotionally charged state has the potency to carry acrosslifetimes and maybe with a vengeance. In this case, “I will not marry…” seemedto be the crux of the issue and almost like a vow.T: Hmm…what is happening next?C: Nothing…I am crowned king and I take charge of my people.T: Okay. Go to the next significant event.C: I am telling Naazneen that I cannot marry her…(tears roll down the client’scheeks); although I had proposed marriage to her…that is the reason I cannothurt her…T: (Pausing) whenever you are ready, go to the next important moment.C: It’s a battle…I am hurtT: How old are you?C: 16…it’s my first battle…we have won but I am hurtI worked with the battle wounds and then checked the story of grief thatbothered my client so much.T: what is the next significant event?C: It is the same last scene…I am dying…I wish I had told her I love her…T: Is it possible, that not marriage but death brings grief…C: [Thinking…as if exploring this possibility] yes…that is true…(sighs) yes… myfather died and so my mother was grieving…my family was grieving…I was notallowed to grieve…and I carried it into this life.We worked to release this vow and then asked the client if the song was playingagain. This time too it was the same songs but the words held a differentmeaning for her now.It was time to bring her back to the present reality and since, it was drizzlingoutside; I asked her what was the relevance of this drizzle…it was drizzling inthe park and in the battlefield…The client was quiet for a long time before the king revealed “when I hadproposed to the girl I loved in that life...it was drizzling”Cynthia suddenly opened her eyes and was surprised at what had come up.Music makes the soul come alive.

Although I had a PhD in Cancer Research from OxfordUniversity, UK, I never expected a similar fate to have developed in my body. Istill remember the phone call from the hospital. I was driving from home to workin the early morning and I had to pull off from the fast lane into a derelictbuilding site, which backed onto the Florida coastline blocking it from my view.As the news of the diagnosis sunk in, and while my head was still reeling fromit, I also had a gut inner knowing that surgery was not for me and there wasanother way. I just did not know what the other way was. Or yet how I would findit.It was a year later in December 2003, after my father had passed over, when Idiscovered “The Journey”, a book written by Brandon Bays. As I read the book, Iknew what was written in the book was going to be responsible for healing mybody, mind and spirit. I started to make the connections between unresolved pastevents and limiting thoughts that may have led to the abnormal cells and shutdown of my reproductive system.I used the Journey™ described in Brandon’s book to heal the abnormal cells andthey literally flowed out of my body and my reproductive system reset to itsproper functioning self. The doctors and nurses were astounded and I was nowliving proof of healing with alternative methods, without the need for drugs orsurgery.The Journey™ is about freedom. All of us sense that deep inside us lies hugepotential. We long to experience it, yet something holds us back. We long to setourselves free, but we don’t know how. With The Journey™, you finally learn how.When Brandon Bays was diagnosed with a basketball-sized tumour in her uterus,she was catapulted into an extraordinary, soul- searching journey. Determined toheal naturally, she took no drugs, underwent no surgery; but six-and-a-halfweeks later she was declared tumour-free. Going beyond current mind-body wisdom,she discovered a powerful means to get direct access to the soul – theunconditional love, the boundless peace, the living presence within us – andpioneered a revolutionary paradigm for healing.Tens of thousands worldwide have since used The Journey™ to awaken to their owninfinite potential and free themselves from lifelong emotional blocks andphysical illnesses.With practical, easy-to-use techniques, The Journey will enable you to:• Dive into your own soul and tap into your own inner genius• Uncover and completely resolve emotional and physical blocks• Uncover repressed emotions and cell memories that can lead to illness, andclear them• Heal your being, your emotions, and your body• Experience the boundless joy, peace, and love within• Live life as an expression of your highest potential• Become truly and ultimately free“An amazing Journey, a gift to us all.” – Jane Seymour, O.B.E., actress, artist,and writer“Brandon’s book is inspiring, exciting and a look deep into the heart about howto live abundantly in a world that often gives too little and takes too much,including the health that sustains us. Her work is a gift to us all.” – TimothyJ. Forbess, president, The National Foundation for Alternative Medicine,Washington, D.C.“The Journey offers a remarkable and innovative approach to accessing importantinner resources that can powerfully support the healing of body and mind.” –Walter Jaros, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, Natural Health Link, andDirector of Professional Training, Green Medicine CompanyThe ProcessThe Journey™ is about freedom – freedom to live your life as you’ve alwaysdreamed it could be.Deep inside all of us a huge potential beckons, waiting to open us to the joy,genius, freedom, and love within. This presence is calling you home right now,longing to set you free. Yet all of us have issues we have felt trapped orlimited by. We hear the whispering of our own soul calling to us, but feelunable to access that greatness. Instead, we feel covered or blocked in someway, limited by our issues – anger, fear, depression, grief, hurt, anxiety. Itmay be as simple as feeling there must be something more to life, or as complexas feeling a complete failure. It may be as debilitating as an addiction or aslife threatening as a serious illness.No matter how deep the issue is and no matter how much you have struggled withit, the possibility exists for you to become absolutely free, whole, and healed.You are capable of getting to the root cause of these issues, resolving them,letting them go completely, and setting yourself free to live your life at yourhighest potential, as a full expression of your true self.Across the globe, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life useJourneywork to discover true freedom in their lives. They’re discovering theirown answers and uncovering their own deepest truth. They are cleaning out pastemotional blocks and physical challenges that have held them back. And they arefinally healing on all levels of their being. Ordinary people are gettingextraordinary results. It seems that no matter what your background is, how oldyou are, what your culture or upbringing has been, everyone knows there is ahuge untapped presence inside, and we all secretly long to experience it. Thispresence is awake while you’re asleep at night, making your heart beat, cellsreplicate, and hair grow. Part of the extraordinary gift of my own healingjourney was to discover and pioneer a simple, yet powerful, step-by- step meansto get direct access to this infinite wisdom – a wisdom that can reveal to youold emotional patterns and memories stored in your cells, and a healing energythat is capable of resolving and clearing those old issues completely so thebody and the being can go about the process of healing naturally.Today I travel all over the world with Journeywork, giving workshops andadvanced programs. I’m always delighted that it attracts people from all thehelping professions, both traditional and alternative. I give talks and seminarsat hospitals, hospices, abuse centres, homeopathic colleges, healing centres,spiritual organizations, and to cancer support and addiction rehabilitationgroups. Everywhere I go, people successfully incorporate Journeywork into theirprofessional programs with ease and grace. I believe we all recognize that thereare some issues that simply require more in-depth, roll-up-your-sleeves healingwork. We know it’s important to address an issue at the deepest level to finallyclear it out and resolve it completely. Together we understand that Journeyworkis a way of bringing about pro- found healing, wholeness, and a deep sense ofwellbeing – no matter what our backgrounds are.Research by the American Centre for Disease Control states that 85% of allillness is emotionally based. So at times of stress and distress it’s nosurprise that heart disease, cancer, depression, asthma, burnout and many otherillnesses are on the increase. Our emotions, thoughts and words influence ourbodies and the effect our cells, DNA and ultimately our health.Over the years numerous scientists and medical doctors have studied andsubsequently verified research in support of The Journey Method. Dr BruceLipton, Candace B Pert, PhD and Deepak Chopra MD and others, have shown that ata molecular level, suppressing emotions can lead to individual cell receptorsbecoming blocked. These blocks then interfere with the normal healthycommunications between cells, and this impairs many body functions. Conversely,allowing the feelings and emotions to flow unblocks the receptors and helpsmaintain health.Dr Deepak Chopra, in his book Quantum Healing, published the theory that traumaand suppressed negative emotions are often stored as ‘phantom memories’ in ourcells. He argued that these cellular memories act subtly over long periods oftime, and can cause disease and illness many years after they have first beenput in place. What Brandon discovered was how to access specific cell memoriesand, more importantly, how to actively resolve and let go of the stored issues.Your emotions play an important role in your physical healthRenowned cellular biologist Dr Candace Pert has established that when we haverepressed emotions, or issues we’ve buried or swept under the carpet, it createsa body chemistry that can block our cell receptors in certain areas of the body.If those cells remain blocked over a long period of time there is an increasedlikelihood for illness to be created in the specific areas where the cells areblocked.The key to cellular healing is to uncover the repressed trauma, or theunaddressed cell memory, resolve it and clear it completely. Then your body andyour being can naturally go about the process of healing and you are leftsoaring in a boundless peace, wholeness and wellbeing that is your own essence.The illness starts where your cells are blocked“What science has found is that when you’re at the peak of a strong emotion, ifyou suppress it at this time – for example as people do when they go into shockor have a trauma – a biochemical reaction will go into the bloodstream. If overtime cells remain blocked, that’s where illness is going to start. The JourneyMethod helps you go through a process of releasing the trauma.” – Brandon BaysYour thought patterns can strongly suppress your immune system“Psycho-neuro-immunology research has produced compelling evidence that ourthought patterns directly and instantaneously affect our whole body chemistry,and can suppress our immune system. We all ‘know’ that angry people get moreheart attacks, and stressed-out people get ulcers. Only happy is healthy, andsome evidence even links grief, fear or resentment to cancer.The Journey is a method of cellular healing that can be experienced in aninitial 3-day seminar. During the 3 days you will learn the exact same skillsthat Brandon Bays and Dr Rangana Rupavi Choudhuri (PhD) used to heal themselvesfrom abnormal cells without the need for surgery or drugs.You are ready for the Journey if you are• Longing for inner calm, health and balance• Feeling stuck or that there’s just got to be more to life• Wanting a solution to heal fear, stress and anxiety• Holding onto repressed emotions or just long to find peace and harmony atevery level• Fed up with the war zone of the mind, emotional stress and bodily tension• Dealing with ill health or ongoing physical issues• Depressed, flat or even hating life and want a deeper more permanentconnection• Wanting more fulfilment in your relationship, career or health• Searching for your own authentic greatness, your infinite potential, yourdeepest truthCase studies with The JourneyMany of the participants who attended the Journey program have stated that theirlives have been positively transformed. Some noteworthy stories includeovercoming longstanding anxiety, instilling hope in healing from cancer, andregaining hearing after 20 years!This is what they have to say…I feel happy within and no longer need to take daily anxiety medication“For me, attending the Journey program was nothing short of a miracle. I wasgoing through the toughest phase of my life. Depression, anxiety, stress, abuse,trauma, lack of confidence, an inferiority complex, a suicidal tendency… I hadthem all. I had a very abusive childhood, both physically and emotionally. Iused to feel trapped, as if I was locked up inside a box, unable to breathe.This led to my developing high blood pressure at a very young age, as a sideeffect of anxiety and excessive stress. I then attended the Journey program andit cleared all my doubts and made me free from the bondage of negativity. ThePhysical Journey process has helped me in clearing many blockages. Afterattending the Journey program, life has changed a lot for me and is stillchanging everyday. I no longer take medication daily for my anxiety attacks, Ifeel a sense of completeness, I am happy from within.” –Navolina Patnaik,Bangalore, IndiaCancer won’t win: combating colon cancer by clearing emotional baggageHaving been fighting colon cancer for four years, Ashi Chandra’s hopes ofrecovery were at their lowest and her spirit at its dimmest. It was then thatshe discovered the Journey.“I completely buy Brandon’s proposition that diseases are the net result ofpiling up negative emotions within us since childhood, that’s when the processof shutting down begins.”Journeywork has helped Ashi to clear the layers of built up hurt and rejection,and to let go of all the excess emotional baggage that hampered her from movingahead. Today, a deeper understanding of what could have caused her disease andthe knowledge that real healing lies in her own hands, has given Ashi a newconfidence that she can and will win the battle against her condition.Excerpt from article published in Mind & Body, Heart and Soul, June 2012After 20 years, The Journey gave me back my hearing!“Over 20 years ago, I had an accident where I fell on my ear. I had lost allhearing function from my left ear after it bled profusely. About 3 weeks ago, Iattended the Journey Manifest Abundance Seminar. After the retreat, on theflight back to Delhi, I suddenly realised that I was able to hear my iPodthrough my left ear. I deliberated and tested it for about three to four weeks,before I contacted my lecturer, Rangana, to let her know the good news andexpress my gratitude to the Journey and the founder, Brandon Bays.” –Nita Gupta,Delhi, IndiaThe Journey gifted me an alternative to chemotherapy“The Journey arrived in my life as an answer to a prayer that I put out to theUniverse. I was diagnosed with lung cancer and western medicine had only‘chemotherapy’ to offer me. Having undergone five cycles of chemo, I wasdesperate for an alternative healing method. The universe gifted me with BrandonBays’ Journey Process.In my first physical journey I visualized my lungs already healing, which gaveme the strength and positivity to go on. Though I had not intended to progressfurther than the Journey Intensive, life and Grace pulled me to attend ManifestAbundance. I began to experience miracles. As each and every Journey processdissolved some part of the disease, ‘chemo’ left my life. I felt energy shiftsin ways that cannot be explained.I have now signed up for the complete practitioner program. It is as if Gracewas calling me, telling me that this is my healing path, and that I will besharing this healing process with others who need it. Through the cancer I wasgiven the message that I have in me the power to bring about miracles. Thiscancer is curable and it’s already being cured. I will soon be able to updatethis story to tell you that my body is completely healthy and free of cancer andall illness…Thank you.” –Vibhavari Bhosle, Pune, IndiaThe TipThe Journey is a method of cellular healing that gets to the root cause of anissue enabling physical and emotional challenges to be resolved. The process wasdeveloped by mind-body-health expert Brandon Bays to heal her from afootball-sized tumour.The different forms of Journey processes are as follows:• Physical Journey – for physical issues like illness, pain, tension, anxiety,addictions, depression and health challenges• Emotional Journey – for emotional issues likes fears, heartache, sadness,grief, hurt, guilt and unhappiness• Abundance Journey – to clear everything and anything in the way of abundancein life, health, career, relationships, financial and spiritual life• No Ego Journey – to clear limitations in the way of self-realisation,spiritual development and personal enlightenment.• Healing Journey – for phobias, fears, limiting beliefs, vows, pain and self-sabotage• Designer Journey – this is totally customised to individual requirements andcan include any and all of the above for getting to the root cause and clearingany issue.The Journey is being used to enable healing from issues such as:• Chronic pain• Anxiety• Grief and loss• Anger and frustration• Fear and stress• Addictions• Illness• Depression• No life direction• Lacking spiritual connectionWhat makes the Journey unique is that it combines emotional healing withconnecting with the body’s infinite intelligence, known as Source, to heal cellmemories, creating a space for forgiveness and healing. When Deepak Chopraanalysed data from tens of thousands of case studies from survivors of seriousillness he noted those that healed had two things in common:1. Ability to access their infinite healing potential or ‘source’2. They uncovered and healed past cell memoriesThese two components are also part of the Journey process, allowing degenerativememories to be no longer passed onto the next generation and for eitherspontaneous or incremental healing to occur.To find out more you can download a free booklet on The Journey with a chapterby Brandon Bays - http://vitalitylivingcollege.info/free-resources/[http://vitalitylivingcollege.info/free-resources/]“Dr Rangana Rupavi Choudhuri is the perfect presenter for The Journey – agenuine embodiment of the work, having used the method to heal from abnormalcells without drugs or surgery.

In fact, I want you to consider thisarticle as a personally drafted message from your Angels meant for you alone.They want you to be aware of their presence so that you can start to work withthem consciously to manifest a wonderful life for yourself. They want to giftyou a life of your dreams. Angels brings to us extension of god’s love andblessing.Even though I am closely connected to this loving world ever since I was a youngchild, my most profound OOBE (Out of Body Experiences) many years ago, fullyawakened me as a Psychic and Heightened Intuitive.Since then, I am living a fully inspired life with my Angels and today as anAdvanced Angel Practitioner by Profession, I am making a smiling difference inmany lives through my renewed teaching /healing abilities. Even today, I feelthat no words of mine are enough to describe their MAJESTIC magnificence.Working with Angels offers you the opportunity to develop wisdom, strengthenself understanding and overcome obstacles by connecting with your inner light,which is a direct pathway to GOD. When we integrate our body, mind and spiritinto one cohesive entity we not only raise our vibrational rate, but also thevibrational rate of the whole humanity and of earth itself. In my experience,Angels help us evolve spiritually by helping us reunite Heavens and earthwithin. These light beings are always with us, watching over us and they want tohelp us personally so that we can attain our natural state of peace, which canlead us to experience all the other joys of life.In my therapy sessions, I am awed till date at the WOW ways the Angels arerehabilitating and helping humanity uplift itself from the clutches of Fear. Tosum it up, Angel Therapy is the fastest, easiest and most powerful healingremedy amongst so many other Alternate Healing Therapies existing above theEARTH. As a Spiritual Teacher I have virtually tried, studied, tested a largevariety of therapies and found Angels as a perfect gift for Humanity.Angels remind us that we being the children of GOD are naturally blessed withthe ability to easily see, hear, feel our Angels’ presence, communicate andinteract with them to receive constant guidance and healings for all situationsand circumstances.The Process• Ever wondered who and what are ‘Angels’?Angels Are Heavens Intermediaries. In a simpler understanding; the word Angelsis derived from greek word ‘Angelos’ meaning Messenger and their job is to bringto us heavenly guidance/ messages/ solutions from our creator GOD for all thesituations at hand that are bothering us. They are light beings – i.e. they aremade of Pure Light and Unconditional love and are created by GOD to help you andme and all on the planet live a life of love, peace, joy and so they aredelighted to help us achieve all that we feel stuck with on our way to LOVE,JOY, PEACE. They bring us Answered Prayers, gifts, Blessings from Heavens in thefastest, easiest and most powerful ways.• Why must we invite ‘Angels’ into our lives?We all go through life’s crest and trough, and each one of us has encounteredmany situations sooner or later where we felt literally pushed through themangle. During such times, we frequently seek a trust worthy authority, figureor power that we could easily connect with and turn to in times of distress andturmoil and so ‘Angels’ Is The Answer.• How do Angels help us?Angels can bring an end to all our struggles almost immediately. They provide uswith greater insights and clarity to deal with all life circumstances with muchease. They help us by delivering timely messages, guidance, health remedies andsome times life saving measures.Angels help you make improved decisions that will take you towards your desiredgoals rapidly thereby bringing in peace, happiness and success. Life today istoo mechanical and fast paced and the demands on us as individuals are many. Itis easy to go split and loose connect with our spirit, the essence that isconstantly in-touch with Heavenly Angels. With Angels, you can powerfullyrestore this connect so that you operate through all life stages just easily andhappily.• Angels can empathize with you - they understand that if our minds are stuck onworldly material focus then we are automatically disturbed and our peace of mindis compromised. So they help us with money solutions, can offer health remedies,help us with child issues, woman issues, career, business, property and the listgoes on for you to add.• Angels are super powerful healers and can help us with almost anything.The best part about them is that even if they cannot alleviate a problemcompletely due to KARMIC accounts, they can surely lighten suffering inmiraculous ways; removing the pain and agony involved and bringing us internalpeace. So an individual finds himself much stronger and in control of all thatsurrounds and with this renewed energy and state of mind will start to attractgood into his life again.• Thus, it is right to conclude that angels can lighten your karma- cause andeffect and many personalized ways they can help each individual on earth.The good news is that as we consciously become aware of Angels, the veil betweenour world and theirs becomes thinner. Even though not every one can actually seean angel, all of us are naturally able to feel them around us. However, with thepersonalized psychic exercises I impart in my workshops, you can awaken yourSpiritual sight -Clairvoyance, completely so that you have profound Angelvisions.The TechniqueHere is What You Can Do Right now to Sense the Presence of Angels1.

I can still feel theawe from the first time I visited this place in my dreams as a child. Despitethe powerful authority in its being this hall had a very sacred, soothing,loving, sublime energy. Everything seemed bathed in glowing, misty white lightas if it the place was made out of clouds. At the time I did not know what I wastapping into but I do remember I wanted to stay there longer.As far as I can recall even as a child I was always intrigued by the cycle oflife and death. I had a deep awareness of a bigger plan and purpose. Visit tothe misty white halls during sleep as a child and waking up with messages ofwisdom beyond my earth age was mind boggling for my parents to say the least. Ifelt an unexplainable connection to these misty white halls and was pleasantlysurprised when I consciously accessed the Akashic records for the first timemany years after. It was a feeling of Déjà vu, a feeling of coming home. I knewI was aligned to a very sublime sacred energy. As soon as I accessed my Akashicrecords soothing sound of chimes and harp greeted me. A great feeling of loveemanated from the records and I could feel the loving joy in my heart.Surrounded with love I witnessed visuals and words that resonated within me,physically as well as emotionally. It was like watching a 4D PowerPointpresentation.Who are we?Most of us are seeking answers regarding our soul journey to explain who we are,what our soul purpose is, why do we suffer, why certain things, issues, patternsare so persistent in our lives? why no amount of effort is good enough to changethem? It’s like being caught in a vicious circle where the variables (people,places, and situations) change but the patterns persist. They just change formbut don’t disappear.Our essence is divine. We embody the Source, representing the highest vibrationof love. We are an integral part of Universal Consciousness and are neverisolated. Earth is our school where we take human form and incarnate lifetimeafter lifetime to learn lessons for soul advancement through life experiences tomanifest the spiritual perfection we embody at a physical earthly level. Throughthese experiences we continue our journey of spiritual growth and evolvementwith the latent desire to align ourselves with our ultimate soul purpose - to beone with Source.I remember during my first conscious journey in the Akashic records I waslooking for answers to some relationship issues. I was definitely not expectingthe insights that came through from not one but three previous lifetimes. Sayingthat I was taken by surprise would be an understatement. I had no idea theissues affecting one relationship was a string of patterns that were manifestingin other areas of my life as well and they were definitely not working in mybenefit. The origin of these issues was totally unexpected and it took a littlewhile for the awareness to sink in. With awareness came healing followed by asense of liberation. Ever since I started connecting with the energy of Akashicrecords, I have been able to see past the illusion and make life choices thathave opened (still opening) new doors and opportunities that I couldn’t havedreamt of earlier.What are Akashic Records?Akasha is a Sanskrit word which means ether, primary or primordial substance outof which everything is formed. It surrounds us in entirety. Akashic records orhall of records as referred to by some is multi-dimensional library of lightwherein all the information and wisdom pertaining to each and every soul everincarnated is encoded in light. The wisdom of the Akashic records is verysublime and for centuries was only available to seers, saints and highly evolvedsouls. It is a responsibility that was only entrusted to the ones who werecapable of respecting its sacredness with integrity. However, in the Age ofAquarius as humanity is evolving we have come from a state of dependency to astate of responsibility, taking conscious ownership for our spiritual growth andevolution.Akashic records have existed from the beginning of time. Even though the name isderived from Sanskrit these are recognized and interpreted by different namesacross different cultures and belief systems (in ‘Torah’ as the book ofremembrance; in Bible as the Book of Life). According to Garuda PuranaChitragupta tracks and builds a record of every action of each life form frombirth to death. In mystical traditions these documents are referred to as theAkashic records, said to contain every action that has ever taken in theuniverse. Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) the American mystic also known as the‘sleeping prophet’ used the trance channeling method to access the records andrelayed information and wisdom pertaining to spirituality and human evolution.Besides Edgar Cayce, theosophist Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891) referred to“indestructible tablets of the astral light” recording both the past and futureof human thought and action; anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) alsoreferred to the Akashic Records in his writings. According to quantum physicistErvin Laszlo –“it is the electromagnetic imprint of everything that’s everhappened in the Universe”. In simple language it would be fair to call Akashicrecords a vibrational filing system where every thought, word, emotion, actiongenerated by soul experience since its beginning is recorded which translatesdirectly to past, present and future possibilities. Whether you come from ascientific or spiritual perspective or both the energy of Akashic records isdeeply healing and liberating.Akashic records are not set in stone. They are ever evolving and this trait canbe attributed to Karma. We are all too familiar with ‘Karma’ - the concept of“action” or “deed”, which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect. Commonlyused in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Taoism; it is synonymous with“what goes around comes around” and “one reaps what one sows” in westernculture. It refers to the totality of our actions and their reactions in thisand past lifetimes, all of which shapes our future. As we live through lifeexperiences we take advantage of the gift of free will and make choices based onmany tangible and intangible components, as a result of which the records areever evolving.Where are Akashic Records located and how they can be accessed?Akashic records exist in the higher realms of Consciousness in Akasha above theastral plane and are guarded by the powerful beings of light. These gatekeepersof the records have never been incarnated. They do not have physical bodies ornames and their strong energetic presence can only be felt. Their responsibilityis to ensure the sacredness and sanctity of the records is protected andmaintained.While accessing information about past lifetimes we tap into the seventhvibration and above where all the information pertaining to past lifetimes isstored. Here we get a chance to meet with parts of our soul with the option ofintegrating with them if this is beneficial for the soul on its journey in thislifetime. At this vibratory level we also get the opportunity to meet with partsof our soul that have already mastered lessons we may be struggling withcurrently.We can learn to access the Akashic records by learning techniques to open therecords. There are various ways of accessing the energy of the Akashic recordslike trance channelling, meditations, sacred prayers, breathing techniques etc.I use a sacred prayer as received by Source during meditations to align with theenergy of the records. This sacred prayer gives us the attunement or the key tofine tune the messages and wisdom being received from this sublime realm. Oncethe Records are opened the Keepers of the Records direct the course and asguided the information that is most valuable for us or others (when we areworking in someone else’s records) is retrieved. By opening the Akashic recordswith a sacred prayer, we get access to the higher realms of the Akasha protectedand guided by Source, Keepers of the Records and Ascended Beings of Light.In the sublime energy of the Akasha all inner sensory receptors are awakened andintuition is heightened. As we open to Divine guidance we allow ourselves toreceive the illuminating wisdom that comes from the ascended beings of light andlearn to translate it for our greatest and highest good and for others when weare working in their records.How can accessing Akashic Records heal?In search of answers we go outside of ourselves to anyone who can give us a rayof hope and explain to us the causes of what we are going through, not tomention a quick fix as remedy. While the energy field and vibration can give ussome information, the long lasting healing power lies deep within our soul.I don’t believe in coincidences. I believe that when one is ready to grow andevolve the Universe orchestrates and aligns everything to support it. It hasalways intrigued and impressed me how upon accessing the records the informationpertaining to current life situations is always highlighted and forefront evenwhen one is unaware of it. During an Akashic record session with Augusta I keptreceiving guidance in form of pictures. I asked Augusta for confirmation butsince it did not resonate (as I was told) with her I started asking forinformation on a different topic. This was a strong message and even though Iwas trying to move past the picture I was repeatedly being brought back to ittill I started seeing the words all lit up. It was something like trying to skipa slide on PowerPoint without success (phew!). When I shared this informationwith her she validated it. The session was not only a breakthrough intoinvisible patterns but was also a big healing experience for her. What I loveabout accessing the records is that they are like online resource (if you thinkabout it they are literally like a virtual library) and the more questions weask the more clearer answers we receive.The past lives specifics like who I was in the past life or what I did in thatlife is not important. What is important is the wisdom that comes from accessingthose lifetimes, the insight into any karmic debts, blockages or patterns thatare still manifesting in the current lifetime as a result of those previouslifetimes.The records point out the origin of such karmic debts, patterns or blockageswhich in most cases can be traced back to previous lifetimes. Some of these arelinked to unfinished business or pending lessons that the soul has yet to learn.In some cases these are the triggers to remind the soul of lessons mastered inprevious lifetime that are waiting to be activated through memory in thislifetime.Akashic Records provide all the information and understanding so one can takeappropriate action. They empower us so we can create a change in our life,release self-limiting beliefs, transform relationships in our inner and outerUniverse and embrace peace as a way of life. They never tell us what to do. Theguidance comes from a non-judgemental place of love and compassion providingopportunities for growth and direction for soul’s advancement.The Akashic Record ConnectionLearning to access one’s own Akashic records is the most empowering tool as wecan align with the energy of our own soul’s records to gain insight, guidanceand wisdom regarding anything to overcome issues and challenges so we can liveour life fully and abundantly. It gives us a sense of accountability for our ownself and a deep healing as we peel through the surface layers to discover theroot system of self, outside the constraints of time and space. Accessingrecords of others is a very enriching experience because it’s not only anopportunity to assist someone progress on their life path but also many timesthe messages received contain wisdom applicable to our own life situations. Oneof the most common feedbacks I receive after Akashic record session is “feelinglight as if some weight is lifted off.”The wisdom and knowledge encoded in Akashic records is sacred. To strengthen therelationship with the records it’s important to work with integrity in therecords. Free will is a gift to mankind and it is absolutely required to respectthis gift and not infringe on one’s free will by accessing their records withouttheir consent. Last but not the least, when we work from a place of pure,unconditional love without interference from our ego we are able to receive andtranslate the messages clearly making amazing progress possible.Bhavya Gaur, Usui/Tibetan Reiki Master/Teacher, Akashic Record Consultant/Teacher, Master of Crystology, Integrated Energy Therapy Master Instructor,Reconnective Healer and Angel Therapy Practitioner.

It was originally known as ‘Kan Yu’.Feng Shui is pronounced as ‘fung schway’ literally translated it means ‘wind andwater’. Feng Shui is not a religion, philosophy or superstition.Feng Shui has gained increasing recognition world over, as the benefit ofpracticing the metaphysical science and art have been self-revelatory andunchallenged. Here is what you achieve:• Creating positive career opportunities• Getting a new job, raise or promotion• Promoting business success• Promoting wealth and prosperity• Bringing respect and fame• Increasing motivation• Increasing creativity• Improving health• Eliminating depression• Warding off addiction• Getting pregnant or preventing miscarriage• Promoting better sleep• Promoting peace of mind• Releasing stress and strain• Feeling more in control• Getting married• Promoting love and romance• Promoting happy relationship• Promoting effective networking• Guarding against separation or divorce• Creating harmonious relationships• Stimulating social life• Developing better study habits• Inculcate positive attitude and habits in children• Keep children guided and self-motivated• Improving a problem child• Preventing accidents• Preventing law suits or malicious influence• Finding a new apartment for home or businessFeng Shui brings much more than all this. It is about achieving life fulfillmentand holistic well-being. Thereby, meaning that Feng Shui, when applied correctlyand skillfully, can bring fulfillment in our life.Feng Shui has the power to add one-third luck to an individual’s luck. Thisconcept has been explained by ‘The cosmic trinity of luck’. As per this, thereare three types of luck: -1. Heaven Luck:Heaven luck is the luck we are born with. It is our fate, our destiny. It isbelieved that we cannot change our heaven luck.2. Man Luck:Man luck is our ‘Karma’. It is our handwork, devotion, dedication, education,our virtues and deeds. This luck comprises of the choices we make in our livesand therefore, is within our control.3. Earth Luck:The place where we live and work influences our well being. This is called earthluck and can be easily controlled by using Feng Shui.Therefore, it is quite clear that Feng Shui significantly contributes to ourluck factor. Feng Shui adopts the principles of ‘Yin and Yang’ to createbalance. Yin and Yang is the fundamental concept of Feng Shui. It is the conceptof equilibrium and harmony. Ideally, for all things to happen smoothly andswiftly, everything should be in a state of balance and equilibrium. Problemsstart if there is imbalance. Yin and Yang are opposite forces but theycomplement each other. There is eternal interaction between Yin and Yang. Yinand Yang can never separate. There is a little yang in all yins and vice –versa. There are different degrees of Yin and Yang in everything in theuniverse. Like life is gray, not pure black or pure white. There is a littleseed of yang, a little white, in yin. Similarly, there is black tone, a littleyin, in yang. Nothing in the universe is completely yin or completely yang.Everything seeks a state of harmony and balance. On a human level, yinsymbolizes feminity and yang symbolizes masculinity.The ProcessIn Feng Shui, application of the concept of Yin and Yang brings harmony, balanceand good future. If the Yin and Yang are not balanced in your home andworkplace, their imbalance can cause physical, mental and emotional problems.Very darks rooms can cause depression and fatigue. On the other hand, extremelybright rooms can cause headache. Feng Shuing your house should be simple. FengShui is the art and science of living in harmony with nature. By living inharmony with our environment, we can harness the beneficial energies known as‘Chi’ to promote prosperity and vitality. Chi (Pronounced Chi) is described asthe air we breathe, earth’s magnetic field, cosmic radiation, sunlight, spirit,our luck. Chi means all this and much more. Chi is ‘Life’s Breath’. To JapaneseChi is ‘Ki’, to Hindus Chi is ‘Prana’ and ‘Ankh’ to gyptians. The concept of Chiis known to all cultures.Chi governs our health, wealth and happiness. Feng Shui harnesses the positiveaspects of Chi for our holistic well being. Chi rides the wind (Feng) and isretained in water (Shui). Feng Shui enables us to harness the Chi of our livingplaces like home and offices.The Tip:To a dark room, add more light. If a room is suffocating, open the windows.Working places should have more yang energy, so that the staff remains activeand works effectively.Children rooms and living rooms should have more yang energy.Bedrooms should have more yin energy to induce tranquility and good sleep.However, do not forget the key word is ‘balance’, so do not overdo!Yoga, martial arts, Qi Gung cultivates Chi in our body. For refining the Chi ofour mind, meditation works the best.In Feng Shui, the importance of clutter clearing can’t be stressed enough.Welcome every Diwali and New Year by spring clearing your house. Clean each andevery drawer with more zest. This will also ensure an organized and efficientfunctioning for your day-to-day life. You should not just de-clutter yourphysical surroundings, it is also equally important to do clearing at anemotional level. Shed all emotional baggage so that you can move light into abrighter future.In your living premises, it is important to remove stagnant chi and bring infresh chi into your home. A very simple technique to do this is to rearrangefurniture, sweep, mop, scrub and dust. Do a thorough and completespring-cleaning. This removes the old, degenerated stagnant chi with fresh andnew chi.Use space clearing and space purification to remove stale energies. Thisinvolves opening the door and windows of the house to refresh the chi. Spacepurification involves going around the house with bell, incense and chantingmantras pertaining to one’s faith. One can also play religious music.Light up your house. Brighten up your house with lights. Use the fire energy ofdiyas, candles and lamps. Use red Lanterns. Display a huge bowl full of orangeson the special days like Diwali and New Year. Oranges in Feng Shui symbolizegood money luck. Hang wind chimes in your house. Wind chimes are an excellentenhancing, energizing and positive tool.Use an auspicious signature to attract prosperity and success. Create a newsignature, which begins with a positive upward stroke and ends with an upwardstroke. This type of a signature denotes a positive beginning and a positive endto every project undertaken.Keep a positive attitude and try to keep your thoughts positive at all times. Ifa negative thought comes, always remember to say ‘cancel’. Stay happy and smilea lot. This always attracts positivity and more happiness.Happy Feng Shuing !Meenakshi is a qualified Feng shui consultant, besides being an architect.

We are bathedin color all our lives, we grow surrounded by color in our environment and home,we dress in colorful clothes, eat colorful foods and make color related choiceseveryday. We learn to interpret our environment as much by color as by shapes orsounds. Our response to color is so basic that till the age of six or even laterchildren sort colored shapes according to their color rather than shape.Throughout our life we continue to use color as a cue for interpreting what wesee: a red apple tells of its ripeness, red traffic lights brings us to a halt,grey hair tells us of middle age. Color codes guide our travels, administrationetc.The colors we see around can noticeably affect our state of mind and feelings.For example, a red colored room produces very different sensations from a roompainted blue. Color is therefore, strongly linked to our emotions. Often wedescribe people as “purple with rage”, “green with envy”, and “yellow withcowardice”. These are the most common color association we use and they havemore truth than we realize. Such associations are only a small part of ourlifelong relationship with color, as we live by the rhythm of color changes thatdenote the passage of time and the cycle of seasons. As the day passes, the huesof the daylight color keep changing. The paler blue light permeates the morningafter the deep blue of the sky before dawn. The afternoon is taken our over by amore yellow hue, followed by the red light of the evening. These shifts are sosubtle and gradual that they are hardly noticeable, but nonetheless they colorour perception of the passing day. The seasons also, highlight very differentcolors, with the fresh greens of the springs darkening as the summer progressesto provide a beautiful blaze of orange, gold and yellow after a few months.Winter brings along with it a stark note and sometimes a spread of snow,reducing the nature scape to a contrast of light and dark. Today’s modern homesoffer light all the time, whether day or night and heat or cold throughout theyear as desired, because of this we sometimes loose contact with the natural,rhythms of daily and yearly cycles.Light and its constituent colors have a strong effect on both body and mindwhether we realize or not. We always respond to color at all the levels: mental,emotional and physical. The red end of the spectrum tends to make our body tenseand an excessive exposure to red increase the blood pressure. On the contrary,blue relaxes our body and lowers the blood pressure. When we see a red room, itappears smaller than a blue one. Emotionally, red excites us whereas blue calmsus. Of all the colors, red and blue light have the most significant and markedeffect on our body. Red light increases blood pressure, respiration, muscularactivity and heart rate. Blue has an exactly opposite effect, relaxes the body,calms and soothes the mind and helps insomnia sufferers. Exposure to blue lightover the whole body has long been a cure for children with jaundice.Our general health and wellbeing is affected by too much and too little light.People who do not get adequate light because they spend too much time indoors inartificial light, which does not provide the full spectrum found in the naturaldaylight or because they live in latitudes where the sun is absent for longperiods during winter, are prone to the ‘winter blues’. On the other hand,excessive exposure to light speeds development and can even induce an ageingeffect. The best example of this is that the girls residing in cities and townswhere nights are artificially lighted begin menstruation earlier then girls fromrural areas who experience a normal day night rhythm of light and darkness.Color is a therapy that can be easily used in conjunction with any medicaltreatment, be it allopathic, homeopathy, Ayurveda etc. to assist healing. It issimple, user friendly, cost effective, beautiful and safe. Bringing in the magicof color in your living spaces is the great way of making your livingenvironment colorful and the same time therapeutic. Adding color in your livingspace is simple and fun!The details given in these guidelines apply to colors seen in rooms in broaddaylight. Ordinary bulbs add a reddish-yellow appearance to colors and whitefluorescent lighting also distorts colors and makes the color seem more bluish.The effect of pale colors is similar to their respective colorful counterparts.However, adding white always tones down the impact. A room painted strong red isover stimulating and tiring but a pink room increases alertness and is mildlystimulating. Do not forget that it is very difficult to find paints in its purecolors. Colors are mixed together and may not result into the real color and maycarry only a subtle tone of the original color. This certainly alters theireffects, even if it does not become immediately apparent to the user.The ProcessRed• Effect - Keeps us alert, enhances activity, stimulates inhalation, brings inpassion, energy, warmth, optimism, increases pulse rate, enhances activity,facilitates judgment, danger.• Pitfalls - Becomes oppressive, tiring and overpowering when strong and dense.This can lead to headaches.

All events are energy driven. Thisstatement comes from the scientific adage that every effect has a cause and thatevery happening has a force behind it. In other words, it is safe to understandthat energy drives the events.Astrology explains the energy in our life and its potential challenges andpossibilities; one can evolve from one’s own chart. It is we who choose the wayto respond to these energies, based on our thoughts, words and actions.Astrology is about making a choice between free will and destiny.Astrology relates itself to planets and to the two luminaries namely Sun andMoon. In modern science, we know, Sun is a star and is the prime mover and,therefore, secondary sources of energy depend upon its energy. Sun sends in itsenergy directly to the earth and, also, as reflected energy from the Moon andother planets. This energy may be light; heat, magnetic, gravitational or anyother that may be discovered by Scientists in the coming years. The energyreaching earth comes from the Sun and other planets both in direct and indirectways.Astrology is the mother of all the sciences. Astrology is marvelous science ifone has a patience to understand it. Astrology is easy to learn but can take alifetime to master. It is purely scientific as based on astronomicalcalculations. It is an ancient practice that assumes that the position of thestars and planets has a direct influence upon people and events on earth.Throughout history, famous people have studied astrology and used it for variedpurposes. The Three wise Men in the Bible were astrologers and learned thatChrist would be born at a conjunction of planets. The Bible is filled withastrological information. Pythagoras and Sir Isaac Newton were astrologers.In India, Astrology is the part of Vedas. Veda means original knowledge andtruth. Vedic means, of the original knowledge and truth. Astrological principleswere written 12,00,000 years ago by 12 famous Maharshis like Narada, Bhrigu,Vasista, Parashara, Jaimini, etc. These Maharishis are acknowledged as havingbeen instrumental of preserving the ancient knowledge. Vedic chart is a road mapdepicting history, genetics and karma, of a person.Our Vedic astrology has details of the horoscopes of Lord Krishna, Lord Rama andmany other ancient Indian kings and queens, recorded thousands of years ago. TheBhishma Parva and Udyoga Parva chapters of Mahabharata mention many astrologicaldescriptions and omens just before the Mahabharata war. It also describes aperiod of draught with several planetary combinations. There is also a veryclear reference about two eclipses, a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipseoccurring, creating a rare 13 day lunar fortnight. In Ayodhya Kand of Ramayana,it is mentioned that Lord Rama was born in cancer lagna. Sage Valmiki has givendetailed information about the planetary position in the chart of Lord Rama.For centuries, humans have looked to the heavens for guidance. History provesthe truth of astrology. We can find reason for everything in astrology. When allthe great sciences in the world failed to explain the reason for a particularthing, Astrology speaks. Astrology as science, used for fortune telling andunderstanding the personality is only a very limited part of astrology and doesnot highlight the complete value of astrology. The generalized zodiac sign stuffthat is read in the newspaper is also not astrology. There is a need to movebeyond our daily horoscope to uncover the complexities and intricacies ofastrology.The ProcessWhenever I sit down and talk to someone about a chart, it strikes me afresh justhow interesting and unexpected people’s stories are. Everyone’s life is not justone story but also a whole necklace of tales threaded together by one soul.Those tales, of course, weave in and out of other people’s lives, creating ahuge tapestry of humanity.Here are few interesting and amazing stories I have come across during myreading of charts1. Astrological Chart can “See” allA well to do businessman once approached me. He had twins, one son and onedaughter, the son died; this left the businessman very upset. He was upsetbecause he was a very religious and god fearing person. He also believed a lotin charity, helping the poor and needy, so he was surprised how such a thingwould happen to him? After checking his charts, I was surprised to read that theyoung boy’s death occurred at a pilgrimage due to hunger, some accident, due towater drowning and some tree. Moreover, just before his death the young boy musthave made huge profit or achievement.It looked strange that a child of such rich family would die of hunger? When Itold the client, he confirmed that his son got the job he wanted in the US andbefore going he wanted to visit Kailash Mansarovar along with his friend. On theway they all were hungry but it was cold, so they decided to get some foodpacked and eat it in the hotel. On the way they took lift from a biker. The bikemet with an accident and the boy fell down in the river, later after flowing forsome time he got stuck in a tree where he was found. It was surprising how hischart could tell me all this about the boy even before the father could narratethe incident.2. Astrolog y Consoles A Worried MotherOnce a woman came to me with a problem, her daughter had got divorced within 3months of her marriage. Her birth chart showed problems in married life and itwas best for her to complete her studies .The mother took my advice and sent herdaughter to USA to do her masters degree. She also did the Vedic healing ofplanets. By god’s grace this showed results, the girl completed her masters,started doing a job of her choice, married someone of her choice in the US andis happy now.3. Astrological Healing Helps Family Get Their Son Back On TrackIn India most of business families are joint families, which means parents livewith their married children, in short, the whole family lives together in onehome. The case that came to me was interesting and different. Here, the father-in-law co-existed with his three daughter-in-laws .The eldest and the youngestsons were financially well to do while the middle son was poor. He used to feelupset about this; his problems grew so much that he soon went and had an extra-marital affair and started drinking heavily. They came to me and got theastrological healings done. Today they are living happily, both husband and wifeare earning well.The logical greatness of astrology can be realized through many other examples.Like, during the full moon children are more hyper, more cars break down andmost important, mental patients show change in mood and reactions. This couldnot be a coincidence. A psychologist may fail to explain this, but astrology canexplain this in a simple manner. In Vedic astrology moon is the indicator ofmind and heart (Chandrama Manaso Jathaha). The moon affects the tides of theocean. The moon rules our emotional nature, and our body is made up of 85%water.I would also like to draw your attention towards medical field, which is verymuch scientific. When a person is sick, they go to see a doctor. The doctorinquires a lot to find out about the disease and then prescribe a medicine. Ifpatient is not cured then the doctor changes the medicine. If still there are nosigns of relief, patient is advised to take many tests. Again new medicines areprescribed. Sometimes operation is suggested or patient is left on the mercy ofgod. We, 21st century people are more logic based, accept this by thinking thatthe doctor has tried a lot. Sometimes the patient goes to another doctor andwhole cycle repeats again. But on another hand, while going to an astrologer, weexpect that the astrologer should tell everything about family, occupation,children, inheritance, prosperity, diseases, etc. .The knowledge, accuracy & theexperience of the astrologer are the factors responsible for the correctness ofthe prediction. Out of many predictions, if a single prediction is wrong then weblame that astrology, as a science is, fake.There are several advantages in studying astrology like, learning to understandand know yourself better, understand hidden knowledge, current influences onone’s life, learning interpersonal skills, seeking self development, enjoyinggood health, prosperity & spiritual advancement, developing analytical facultiesof children, developing leadership qualities, analyzing and strengtheningrelationships etc.,Human beings in their life face a lot of pain, misery and troubles, which affectthem both emotionally as well as physically. To avoid pain and to seek pleasurehas been one of the major objectives of our lives. The other major objective fora selected few of us is to know our true self and to know the ultimate realityand be one with it. Whether the objective is material or spiritual, as per one’sdestiny there could be a lot of hurdles.Jyotish Vidya shows the path and result of karma done in past and freedom tomake the future through the position of nine planets. When in exaltation, theimpress of the planet can be gentle and often very spiritual and suggests thekarma of positive qualities from the past endeavor. In the same way, a planet ina bad position suggests traits that may have been misused, neglected or actedupon in an erroneous manner in previous life creating problems is present life,thus the chance to work on them is accorded in this life. Particular house,compatibility, incompatibility and aspect of planets also play an important rolein suggesting that how particular energies have blended and worked together inthe past, whether in a harmonious or antagonistic way.Vedic astrology has not only given us tools to determine what destiny has instore for us but also ways to avoid the hurdles in achieving our material orspiritual goals. Remedial Measures allows one to solve his or her problems bymodifying the karma in a systematic way. These measures help in solving karmicproblems.The Tip• In astrology, wearing a gemstone ring is very common because a ring is acircle, symbol of eternity, unity, reincarnation and the universe. In ancienttimes, rings were associated with Sun and Moon, hence it was an object ofprotection, a magical guard that warded off negativity through its continuity.Rings bind the person with power, energy and keep them in body and so inhibitthe release of power.• Colour therapy is another scientific tool for healing in astrology. Yellowcolours rules solar plexus and is useful in study rooms. Blue helps to cureheat, anger, passion as it is the colour of peace. Use of Indigo helps indiabetes, impotency, urinary troubles etc and helps to adapt a practicalapproach towards life. Violet being a mixture of red and blue helps researchers,aspirants of mystic sciences etc.• Reciting mantras at a particular day and time has dramatic results in one’slife.• Fasting is another scientific method of healing in astrology.Dr. Dipikka Sanghi Gupta is very gifted and famous astrologer based in Delhi.She is a pioneer in the field of Astrological consultancy services, Numerology,Tarot Card reading, Palmistry and Vaastu Shastra.

Sometimes sound refers to only those vibrations with frequencies thatare within the range of hearing. However, we understand sound to be an orderedmotion of the molecules of the medium through which the sound propagates.Can we define Sound as a manifestation of energy spontaneously erupting thendispersing back into the Universe! Our own voice vibrates and creates its ownenergy. Each thought-wave produced by the mind, therefore, emits a certain soundand that sound is the combined sound of the various acoustic roots associatedwith the various propensities active in that thought. What the yogis thendiscovered was that if an acoustic root or combination of acoustic roots wasrepeated in the mind it would create a sympathetic vibration that would activatethe corresponding mental propensity. By repeating the acoustic root for anger, afeeling of anger would arise in the mind. By repeating the acoustic root forcompassion, a feeling of compassion would be induced. The closer the soundrepeated was to the actual acoustic root, the stronger the wave of that mentalpropensity that would arise in the mind. It was these discoveries andinvestigations that led directly to the science of rhythmic chanting.Our bodies are made up of particles of energy, and there is a vibration that isconstantly pulsating through them. Stresses, imbalances, and weakness can causethese energy particles to change the vibration of our body. Sound acts as asolar massage for the entire body and nervous system. This occurs on a cellularlevel and, as we know, our cells are constantly changing; so, our body is neverthe same. With the use of rhythmic chanting, we can build a new body that beatsto a higher vibrational level by instilling that vibration in the buildingblocks of our body.Each and every expression of Universe, each and every wave creates a sound. Thesound is called the “acoustic root” of that expression. Can we give a ‘meaning’to Sound? Probably not or certainly not! we can give meaning to words and not tosound(s). It is because words are a result of civilization of mankind. Wordscame later and are products or expressions of collective-mind of mankind; as,words were developed for a convenient and effective means of communication.Sounds came prior to civilization; they came along with the human beings andliving beings. Sounds are more primitive than the living beings or human beings.The earlier human beings, when words or the language were not created, used thesounds, essentially, to convey their emotions e.g. the emotion of love, theemotion of fear, the emotion of anger, and likewise. What we need to understandis that such sound or every sound has a specific source (or part) where it iscreated in the human-body and that specific part of the human-body representsthat specific emotion created by the sound.This linkage of the emotion vis-à-vis the sound was understood and mastered bythe eastern world thousands of years ago. The eastern world or the Ancient Indiahad a very advanced culture intellectually and spiritually; and a language,‘Sanskrit’ was developed which itself means “refined, well done.” The alphabetsin Sanskrit are perfectly designed for the human vocal apparatus, and arepronounced phonetically. Sanskrit was essentially designed for sound and it isan exquisite language from ancient India. It is considered divine, originatingfrom the meditations of ancient Sages. Sanskrit is pronounced accordingly as itis written, and no sound is dropped while uttering its written word(s). Forthousands of years, the profound teachings of India have been chanted over andover, preserving the essence of their meaning. Chanting Sanskrit word(s) forms adirect link or an acoustic root to the vibrations through sound.The ProcessThe ancient Indian Seers discovered fifty principle acoustic roots (ormatrikas*) which, either alone or in combination, are at the root of all psychicexpression.These fifty roots, on which they based the fifty letters of the Sanskritalphabet, correspond to the fifty principle natural tendencies of the humanmind, such as fear, anger, compassion, etc. These fifty natural tendenciescombine together to give rise to the infinitely rich matrix of human thought.One or more of these natural-tendency is always active in the human mind at anygiven point of time, to one degree or another, and the combination thereofproduces the phenomenon that we know of as human thought. When these fiftynatural- tendencies become completely quiescent then the pure consciousnessshines in its original, unaltered state.Among the various psychic-tendencies, those acoustic roots which awakened thecore tendencies of the individual mind became the subject of intense researchand with the passage of time the processes of rhythmic-chanting or the mantraswere born which tuned not only the mind and the emotions, but the body and itsglands as well to the subtle wavelengths of the ‘Self ’.The rhythmic chanting forms a complex pattern of vibrations meant to activatecertain centers in the human body by repetition of the mantra. Each Mantra holdsthe ability to open your energy body, emotions, and soul to a higher vibrationallevel. Silently repeating rhythmic chanting creates a mental vibration thatallows the mind to experience deeper levels of awareness and leads into thefield of pure consciousness from which the vibration arose.One thing more worth giving attention seem to be that the world does not existas we see it; it is merely a huge mass of vibrations. In the system ofexistence, there are bodies of condensed vibrations having enormous potential(s)which are beyond the understanding of normal human beings. In a higherprobability, these bodies-of-condensed vibrations are the deities given nameswhich indicate the nature-of-powers represented by them e.g. Kali, Durga,Lakshmi, Indra, Bhairava, Shiva and likewise. A Mantra is not merely a sound butessentially, a process to put us in the vibrational-layer of the specific deity.Each human being is in essence a mantra, a very unique yet cosmic mantravibrating at its own level, rhythmic-chanting of Mantras attune us to the layerof vibrations of that specific deity and we acquire the powers of that specificdeity as his/her grace.The exploration of relationship between the sound and the consciousness can leadto a whole different understanding of the world we live in and the world wecreate. When we have this perception about ourselves, we cannot help but let goof old patterns and obstacles and enjoy the wonder of being part of the cosmicsymphony.This is an example which indicates that India has a lot in its Belly andBrain….. and while saying so, I am not referring to the physical boundaries ofIndia. In fact, I am referring to the unfathomable depth of spiritual history ofthis Nation. When I say ‘India has a lot in its Brain’, I refer to the potentialof creativity a mind cultivated in above referred Indian-ness can have; and,when I say ‘India has a lot in its Belly’, I refer to the ‘secrets’ which therich spiritual heritage of India is carrying in its ancient scriptures. Asstated above, the Ancient Indian Sages have given us potent mantras andseed-mantras which have the potential of working directly on ourkarmic-impression and giving us the key to re-write our destiny.The Seed Mantra (or the beej mantra) is a very potent set of sounds which canhave a vowel, a consonant and an element of vibrating sound imbibed in it. Thevowel is ‘the-carrier’ which carries the sound energy (created by consonant) inthe intended energy-centre in the body; for example the sounds having ‘ee’type-pronunciation travel towards ‘lower chakras’ centered near sexual-organs inthe body; and, sounds having ‘O’ type-pronunciation travel towards ‘upperchakras’ centered near throat or the ‘third eye’ (middle of the eyes) in thebody. We therefore find that, generally, most of the shakti-mantras have ‘ee’type sound in them which strikes the ‘energy dynamos’ centered near sexualorgans. As a result, we create the type of power (or energy) needed by us tomeet all the worldly affairs be it sex, money, fame etc. We further find thatthe mantra having ‘O’ type sound in them strike the energy-dynamos centered near‘upper chakras’ and as a result the journey of soul tends towards purest form ofcompassion, spirituality and moksha.Here is an example, which indicates the presence of a Seed (beej) in a Mantra:There is a Sloka in Shree DevyaAtharvaSheersham which is as under: 42.png [../images/00065.jpeg] ViyadiKar Sanyuktam VeetihotraSamanvitamArdhEnduLasitam Devya Beejam SarvArthSadhkam.When we expand the meaning of the above sloka, it becomes:THAT which includes Viyat = ether [(h) sound] and ‘ee’ sound; and also includesVeetihotra=Fire [ (r) sound] and is decorated with the ArdhChandra [(mmm)vibrating sound], THIS seed of Devi is capable of fulfilling all desires(SarvaArthSadhkam). Now, what we get in this sloka can be summed as under:It is sound of H, Combined with R, Combined with Vowel sound of ee and decoratedwith the MM vibrating sound =H R EE M = Hreem (the result is beej mantra = Hreem).This seed-mantra ‘Hreem’ is a Shakti-Mantra, the rhythmic-chanting of whichactivates the hidden powers of a Sadhak and places him in a higher level ofvibrations. With the patience-practice of this seed-mantra ‘Hreem’, life of theSadhak gets totally transformed touching new heights of worldly achievements andspirituality as well.Another thing which needs to be kept in consideration is that there are a numberof seed-mantras which are yet to be deciphered or yet to be given an explanationof their actual genesis or their being the way they are. While the quest tounderstand the genesis of seed-mantra cannot be denied but at the same time whatis more important is getting beneficial impact of the seed-mantras given inancient texts rather than mere searching for its genesis. Had the Adam thoughtof first knowing the genesis of the fruit Apple, he would not have been able toeat it, forever.The last but not the least, mantras are based on sound-vibration-energy and thisenergy has no religion; hence, mantras are equally effective for every humanbeing following any religion on this earth. The only requirement is that theseare to be done under the guidance of a competent guru.The TipIn Tantra, the fifty or fifty-one letters including vowels as well as consonantsfrom A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of Bija, havebeen described as being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they areinfused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are consideredto be the subtle form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make upsyllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of theseelements that mantra is composed. It is believed that the power of mantraderives from the fact that the letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of thegoddess.The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti,Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma,Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti,Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada,Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha,Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari,Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta. Sometimes, the Matrikas represent adiagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.Ashok Angrish is a Vedic Scholar who teaches Healing through mantras.

Hegde “The establishment defends itself by complicating everythingto the point of incomprehensibility.” Fred HoyleIt was in the year 1733 that Charles Scharschmidt, a brilliant young professorof medicine in Vienna, wrote the first textbook of medicine. While writing aboutdiseases with constriction of the vascular bed and agitation of the mind he hadthe best prescription for those days, which looks contemporary, even to thisday. Change of mode of living, tranquility of the mind and drugs rarely, ifneeded at all, were the three points in his textbook. Listening to the debate onthe March 3rd 2010 morning where President Obama gave his last dose of wisdom tothe people of America as also to his colleagues in all the political partiesabout his “so called” health care reforms, I was a bit confused as he wastalking only about disease care reforms and NOT about health care reforms.In a recent symposium sponsored by Deepak Chopra Foundation at San Diego we weredeliberating on the newer, inexpensive and safe vectors of human healing.Scientists and spiritualists from all over the world who are working in thisarea were invited, as speakers and I happened to be one of them. We are bringingout the abstracts of the talks and papers presented there in this issue of JSHO.The full symposium will eventually be uploaded to the JSHO website in alldetails.America is suffering from overmedication and over intervention of all sortsresulting in the abuse of the disease care facilities which cost the nationtrillions of dollars; most of which could be well spent if only the powers thatbe understood the difference between health care and disease care. The euboxicmedicine practised in the US, where all the computer boxes in the patient caserecord will have to be perfect, lest some one should sue the doctor in theunlikely event of patients’ death or disability, makes medical careprohibitively expensive. Market forces dictate the management and not science.The whole population of the USA needs urgent health care but a microscopicminority really needs disease care. This truth is being kept well wrapped up inpseudo-scientific jargon, myths, half- truths and disease mongering efforts toearn billions from the gullible patients or their caregivers. It is much cheaperto keep the well healthy rather than let them get diseases and then target thedisease. This is the rule in the USA as also in other places like India whereAmerican medicine is being encouraged.The above difference is simple enough to be understood by the lay public.However, today the common man on the street thinks that he needs doctors andhospitals to remain healthy and that there is a pill for every ill. What is tobe brought to the knowledge of the population is that if they lived a healthylife style, which will be described below, they could expect to live well andhealthy till they die. No one should try to be here forever, as s/he will neversucceed.It is only in the unlikely event of the body’s inbuilt immune guard gettingoverwhelmed do symptoms of diseases make their appearance. It is only then thatthe medical profession could help by: “curing rarely, comforting mostly, butconsoling always”, as was enunciated by the father of western modern medicine,Hippocrates. There are no silent killers. All killers announce their intentionsloudly in human physiology. Studies have time and again affirmed that treatingdiseases in their “so called” asymptomatic stage only would harm the patientsince nature has built the immune guard with elaborate repair mechanisms toremodel every deviation for the normal, which is the asymptomatic stage ofillnesses. Any interference at that stage from outside, that too with chemicaldrugs, can only harm the former and might result in disaster.Healthy life style and tips:No one can help another to adopt a healthy life style. One has to be the changeand no amount of preaching will help. One has to take charge of one’s health andwellness. The methods are simple and could be adopted by anyone in any walk oflife howsoever busy one might be! Human body is a nonlinear, dynamic device,continuously run by food and oxygen with the help of the electromagnetic energyfrom the sun. Some physiologists believe that the body water, which forms around80-85% of the body, needs to be stimulated (burnt) to release energy.• Human beings are not just their bodies; they have their all-pervading mind andtheir spirit. All three of them need to be kept healthy for total health andwellness. Usually it is not what one eats that kills her/him; it is what eatsone (one’s negative thoughts) that kills. The best bet to keep good health is tohave a healthy mind, which, boils down to practicing universal compassion. Toget into that state of mind (consciousness) Yoga and the breathing techniqueswould help a lot. Yoga has very little to do with any religion and could bepracticed by all.• To be healthy one has to change (be the change) but can’t expect the world tochange overnight. Therefore one could expect others to hurt us sometime or theother. There again the best anti-dote for hurt is to cultivate the greatestasset of forgiveness. “If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty secondsworth of distance run, this earth shall belong to you my son, and…more, Youshall be a MAN,” wrote Rudyard Kipling years ago in his celebrated poem, IF.This is the best health advice that I have been able to find in the westernliterature.• Eating in moderation, the foods that please one, without too much change inthe food quality from its natural state, would go a long way to help the immunesystem to keep the repair mechanism in excellent shape. Worrying about themicro-contents of the food is of lesser importance as long as one does not pickand choose foods, thanks to the modern food fads and corporate advertisements.• Preserved foods are a curse. Let the food be as fresh as is possible. Smallfrequent feeds keep the metabolism on even keel. Large meals at long intervalsare not conducive to body physiology. Each region, ethnic group and race has hadits own food habits that kept mankind going in 50,000 generations. The foodhabits evolved over thousands of years, thanks to our ancestors’ observationalresearch. Modern nutrition does not have a strong foundation and thereductionist cohort studies being fed to the gullible masses lack the backing ofgood science. That is exactly the reason why we get conflicting advices now andthen! If Mediterranean diet is good for them in their habitat, it does not meanthat it will be good for another race in another continent. Meal times should behappy times and family get- together at mealtime is the best bet to get benefitfrom foods.• The two enemies of human health are tobacco and alcohol, both of which must bekept at a distance.• Regular exercise, moderate in quantity, the best being a daily walk for anhour, would be the ideal tonic for the immune guard. Very heavy exercise mightnot be good for the system. The key word in every human endeavor should bemoderation in everything one does. Extremes are always dangerous. Swimming isanother excellent exercise but is not universally applicable and could beexpensive to the majority.• There is no substitute for hard work as another good immune booster. If thehard work involves physical exertion additional regular exercise is not needed.The only qualification is that one should love one’s work to get the benefit.Hating one’s work and working under duress could destroy health.• Spirituality has very little to do with religion. Spirituality for good healthis just sharing and caring! Sharing provokes the immune system and hating othersdepresses the same. A small child smiles 400-500 times in a day. If we take alesson from that the world would be a better place to live. Natural smilereleases so many healthy bio-positive endorphins from the brain.Conclusions:If one were to follow the above-mentioned simple daily routine, the wellnessconcept, the chance of falling ill are negligible like following traffic ruleson highways can reduce fatal accidents. That said, I must hasten to add thateven those who follow the health rules enumerated above might get illnesses asdiseases are only accidents. Medical science or any other science will never beable to answer the million dollar question as to why a person gets sick at agiven time although we have elaborate details to frighten the gullible people asto how they get ill, in our disease mongering, medical (health) scare system. ANobel Laureate physiologist had affirmed to that truth way back in 1899, whenCharles Sherrington, wrote that “positive sciences will never be able to answerthe question why, but they will be able to say how or how much! “If we were to implement this method we would reduce the medical care budget ofevery country. All the same an efficient and authentic medical care system is amust under the following circumstances, which covers about 5% of the populationat a given time. Emergencies, disaster management, corrective surgeries,judicious authenticated vaccinations, birthing emergencies, congenital problems,and acute life threatening situations need medical help.The need of the hour is to change our medical education system to incorporatethe new philosophy of health promotion, which is never taught these days. Thestudent must be taught that the human body could correct most of its problemswithout outside interventions but we must create the right environment for thatto be useful. Too much intervention might put off the body’s immune system.Doctors are trained primarily to keep the public healthy (public health) whichis not our present stress. Young doctors should be impressed that they shouldleave the well alone and they should never try to treat the disease but try andunderstand the patient better before intervening, and they should see that theirinterventions do not make the patient worse than his/her original disease! whilea good doctor treats the illness; a great doctor treats the patient.The need of the hour is for thought leaders in the field to understand thatthere are a host of medical care systems in the world, out with our reductionistmodern medicine, that have stood the test of time over thousands of years beforethe advent of modern medicine. But for them human kind would have been extinctlike the dinosaurs long, long ago. Modern medical system, developed in the lastfew centuries’, in its present avatar of hi-tech stuff is only less than a fewdecades old. One has to take into account the recent audits in many countries onthe impact of modern medicine on human morbidity and mortality. The data isthere for all to see and take corrective measures lest we should be left out inthe race. Every medical student must be told that while patients could (and did)survive without modern medical doctors; we cannot survive without patients. Weneed urgent research to try and scientifically authenticate many of thoseinexpensive methods in other systems of medicine to put together a future systemincorporating the best in all the systems together-call the new system MetaMedicine (after modern medicine) if you like-to help patients and also the worldgovernments to contain the ever mounting costs of medical care which would makepeople like President Obama to get sound sleep while his people remain healthyand when they fall ill they are well cared for without spending too much of thetax payers’ money which should satisfy both sides of the divide. The effort oftrying to put together Meta Medicine is already on.In this deafening cry for better hi-tech medicine let us not forget that thewomb of all ills, ranging from common cold to cancer, is poverty. The latter isa double- edged weapon in that while diseases are more common in the poorersections, diseases further make the sufferer poorer when the breadwinner getssick the family starves and becomes poorer. The poor people with very littleprotein in their system suffer from a very serious illness, which I call asNutritional Immune Deficiency Syndrome, NIDS, which is many times more dangerousthan the fashionable label of AIDS! It was a thinking family doctor in the poorcoal mining community of wales, Tudor Edward Harts, who wrote decades ago: “thepoor pay for their poverty with their lives.” This one line tells it all andshould be taught to our doctors and politicians alike.“Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in themultiplicity and confusion of things.” -Isaac NewtonProf. B.M.

Due to the fact that many ofus hold the ancient masters in high regard, it is natural for us, as new-agers,to want to portray or believe that our ancient teachers would support thenew-age movement. After all, we founded this movement, in part, based on thewisdom of their teachings. We’ve done this through taking a little of onemasters teachings, a little of another’s, and we’ve packaged it all together asa philosophy that we feel is good to live by. Yes, there are huge differences;but, we circumvent around these differences through rationalizing that we livein different times.Because we have taken pieces of wisdom from different places, it does not alwaysoffer us a complete picture of the masters involved. What many people may noteven know is that many quotes that are floating around the internet, and whichwe believe are the words of our masters, are fake, misworded, or taken out ofcontext (e.g. see FakeBuddhaQuotes.com). While people may see this as arelatively trivial matter, it really isn’t. After all, how would we feel if wesaw a Facebook banner which displayed an image of Jesus with the quote, “Ho, ho,ho, Merry Christmas! – Jesus Christ?”Many of us, having not studied the works of many of our masters, only seecollectively chosen quotes from a small portion of a master’s work. Theseportions may be framed in a way that the master appears to support our new-agesentiments. What we never see is the remainder that would have been in directconflict or might appear “negative.” Unfortunately, this promotes disinformationand misunderstanding as to who our masters really were and what they reallytaught. To prove this, I even posted a real Buddha quote (from the Dhammapada)on Facebook and someone confronted me that the quote must be fake because Buddhawould “never have said” that.So, keeping this all in mind, it is fair to say, yes, there is disinformation inthe new-age. And, it is safe to wake up to it, as well as where disinformationexists outside of the new-age. It is safe to realize that the new-age has anagenda just like every other religion, cult, faction, institution, etc. Even Ihave my own agenda. So, you must find the Truth for yourself.The new-age agenda appears to be with distraction, denial, and the repression of“negative” emotions and thoughts, while encouraging individuals to keep up witha consumerist mentality that is destructive both internally and externally. Thisis not passing judgment here; I’m just dispassionately stating a perceptionwhich seems, to me, a fact.What I’ve learned through having been part of the new-age for most of my life isthat there is something inherent in the path that creates a no-win situation. Onthe one hand, we are taught to deny “negative” illusions as unreal. On the otherhand, we are taught to exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of “positive” illusions(which many masters have discouraged this kind of approach, and excessmaterialism, though we may not have understood why). Some of us are starting tocatch on that living in this way leaves us subtly feeling that we never have orare enough. For, this is another illusion: that we can attain a feeling ofcompleteness if we can manifest this-or-that. However, fulfillment rarely isforthcoming, as once we complete a goal we immediately seek to attain somethingelse.While not suggesting we live entirely without external striving or material“abundance,” what may be labelled as more problematic is our collectiveapproach. Because we live in a world which we perceive as ‘normal,’ we do notalways understand the ways in which we become conditioned, as individuals withina larger society, to have things defined for us; i.e. such as success, failure,abundance, loss, etc. We have so much information coming at us that, “you canshine,” “you can succeed,” or “you can have unlimited this or that.” But, noticehow this leaves the subtle impression that we are lacking. So, repeating thesekinds of mantras naturally serves as an inspiration that keep us driven. But,toward what end? More illusion and potential suffering?I am not implying this is right or wrong, merely that many of us may not alwaysbe aware of how we are being conditioned, or the effects of such conditioning.After all, how many of us could live a simple unaffected life without worryingwhat people would think? How many of us get called “lazy” for not beingproductive enough? How are we conditioned out of taking care of our minds andbodies through being encouraged that we need quick-fixes-because there is notenough time for rest? Many of us are terrified to slow down in ways lest we missan opportunity for advancement, or let ourselves or others down in some way.I find ix no wonder that so many people end up with “ascension symptoms.” Seenfrom a rational perspective of cause and effect, these symptoms likely arisefrom the living split between our minds (which tell us to be “love n light”) andour contradictory lifestyles (which ask us to be aggressive, striving,competitive, and to not truly care about anything beyond our personal outcomes).Many of the idealistic concepts that we espouse, don’t even add up with how welive our lives. For, how can we truly end up manifesting peace, love, andoneness while being taught to be self-entitled, self-oriented, and to climbvarious hierarchical ladders to “success”?Looking at how innately aggressive the world is, and how we keep marching andbanging our drums like little energizer bunnies trying to get ahead, to me, itmakes sense that new-agers feel sped up–ADHD; anxious, repressed emotionssurfacing; sleep-disturbed; and intolerant to food, chemicals and geopathicstress (aka “dirty energy”). We seem to lack the wisdom of our masters which wasby- passed and which could have advised us on how to bridge the various splitswe created in our minds and lives. In fact, it seems many of our present-daygurus can only instruct us on how not to deal with negative realities andemotions as they come up, which come to be treated with distaste anddissociation.We end up being taught conflicting messages regarding how to find our “offswitch.” On the one hand, we are taught to practice meditation and to be “in thenow;” finding our divine self-worth internally. On the other hand, we are taughtthat we can have it all, be special, be a “star seed, blue ray, etc.,” or can“succeed” or “manifest;” finding approval and self-worth externally.On top of this, we are taught to withhold judgment. Taken out of context, wecome to lose the discriminating ability to identify and address disharmonies oruntruths within the world; except those truths we deem “positive.” we forgetthat if we want to manifest things that are “good,” there must exist an oppositepolarity where things become “judged” as “not so good.” we have to be carefulnot to forget that judgment also implies “karma,” which can incur fromcollectively self-destructive behavior that is continually enabled. Though,there are more and more people waking up to this now.The main fear seems to be one of being unloving. Though, enabling one another’sbad behavior or addictions is not something I would consider loving. The mainaddiction of this age appears to be one of consumerism and self-indulgence. And,lacking a standard of ethics to follow, we can end up inadvertently andunconsciously acting impulsively, with no restraints and little care for how ouraddictions affect the younger generations, the environment, etc.Through the Law of Attraction, we are taught accountability, but primarily whenit comes to our personal lives and not the bigger picture. When it comes to thebigger picture we are taught a completely different approach: “Don’t think aboutit or it will manifest.”The biggest truths we miss through the misquoting of our masters are their ownrealizations that the path to ascension comes through what we release ratherthan gain. However, we all fear loss and in trying to avoid it, we spin out inthe opposite direction of trying to manifest gain (at a cost of loss ofresources and vitality of our bodies and environment).If we can come to understand the true wisdom of Buddha and other masters we willrealize that if we wish to deny all negatives based on their being “illusion,”this must be matched with denying all positives too, based on the same argument.For, the pursuit of only pleasure brings as much harm, egotism, greed, self-entitlement, addiction, compulsion, destruction and suffering (as evident withinNature) as does the pursuit of negatives.While the answer is not likely not to be found in any kind of extreme, the dis-informed new-age appears to be split between two ends of the spectrum: an “allspirit” focus on one end (with ideals of love and light) and a hedonistic “allmaterial” focus on the other (with ideals of manifesting “unlimited” abundance,fame, etc.). There is one path we have yet to collectively try yet: the middlepath that Buddha was known to speak of. The middle path leads us to a simplepath; one not found in remaining dis-informed, but in becoming enlightened.Mandy Peterson is a Visionary, Empath, EFT Practitioner and Channel for spirit.Her life and passion has always been toward being a voice of empowerment.

As a child I would quickly sense the energyaround me with my very being and how it made me feel and deep down I always knewthat I had a gift, which had to be shared. A powerful invisible force alwaysguided me to the right place at the right time. All I had to do was trust andmove forward.It was only after I quit my job that I realized I now wanted to give new meaningto my life. I had many questions about my life and life in general. I just knewI wanted answers to my questions, not from anyone else but from within. I knewthat learning Tarot was the first step towards achieving this. I wanted to learntarot from my early college days but was not finding a teacher. I can’t put itin words how deep my yearning was to learn Tarot. I bought a deck anyway andstarted connecting with the mesmerizing cards. Tarot was not so popular backthen and finding a teacher was quite a task. It was only after I completelysurrendered and let go of my deep quest for a teacher that I finally met MaSuraja, my lovely tarot teacher through the New Age Foundation in 2005. Andthat’s when my real inward journey started. During my journey, so far, one thingbecame crystal clear to me that I have to share my gift with the world.Suppressing it and not sharing will only bring unhappiness to me. This messagejust kept coming back to me until I finally completely accepted it.Tarot is a wonderful tool to know and understand where exactly you are in thehere and now. It’s like gazing at yourself in the spiritual mirror and lookingat your truest self. The experience of a tarot reading can be truly liberating.It helps you to let go and gain amazing clarity, which helps you move forwardwith ease. It leads to these “aha” moments when you really know what your fearsare and where they are stemming from and how unreal they can be, losing theirpower when you know them. And that you are finally able to put your finger onwhat was bothering you all this while or what you really needed to know or both.Having the cards read can instantly clear one’s foggy mind and help one chooseand live life with more zest. The beautiful cards help you to know andunderstand what you truly feel about yourself and what you want the most whichis great in achieving true well being. when you have clarity about yourself,there’s an instant positive shift in you which leads to lasting happiness andbrings about much needed closure if required. Tarot includes a deck of 78 cardsdepicting and holding the deeper meanings of the cycle of life, which helps youto simplify your life in today’s world.A session can lift years of burden, pain, misery and other negative emotions andgive you the beautiful experience of lightness, expansion and freedom. Whatbetter way to simplify your life and bring in the much needed clarity and peaceand you can truly empower yourself in the process. As Plato said, “The part cannever be well unless the whole is well.”When one has mental peace and clarity it can magically open doors to truehappiness and help you heal on all levels. I am truly blessed to have learntTarot and several healing modalities from some of the best teachers. Theirteachings brought about many more positive changes in my life. They were alwaysavailable with all their love and wisdom. I would then and continue now toappreciate all that they are and the work they do and feel so deeply thankful,loved, cherished and cared for.That’s when I started to realize the true power of gratitude.“Be thankful for what you have; you’ll end up having more. If you concentrateon what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough.” - Oprah Winfrey.Much has been written and spoken about gratitude and being thankful but I feelthat words can’t truly capture its potency and beauty. For me, gratitude is thisenergy, which first leads to self-acceptance, realization of true self worth andself-love. It truly allows me to be in the now. To totally appreciate all that Ihave and all that is. Also, when I look at the past, I do it with a loving,happy heart feeling thankful with my entire being thanking all the people,events and things that helped me along my beautiful and empowering journey tothis day.Looking at my near future again with gratitude in my heart which then fills myentire being. Gratitude for all that is in store for me. When you are in theprocess of manifestation you thank the Universe in advance. Thanking magicallyripen the seeds of what you are manifesting and transform them magically intoreality. Thanking in advance creates so much faith in you and you become thisgorgeous shining magnetic vessel, just ready to receive. Being thankful andhaving deep gratitude opens your heart and rewires your brain. Once you get intothe practice and eventually start living in gratitude, life will give you somuch more to be thankful for.I have truly witnessed the power and beauty of having deep gratitude. It makesyou more receptive, which further expands your energy and makes you this broadvessel for receiving all the goodness in life. People who struggle withreceiving miraculously shift their energy from being hesitant to receiving tobeing beautifully receptive to receiving once they truly start living ingratitude.Gratitude is an antidote to many negative emotions and feelings. Gratitude islike a magic potion. Once you have a sip, once you take in its essence, thedivine taste nearly consumes your entire being and then the only way is forwardwith child like wonder. I started by maintaining a gratitude journal where Iwrote all that I am thankful for. Now I live in gratitude as much as possible.Living with an attitude of gratitude has made me more receptive to love in allforms. When love and gratitude come together the energy is super powerful.Here I would like to talk a little about a wonderful Japanese scientist Dr.Masaru Emoto who has written this amazing book called The Hidden Messages inwater. He conducted this amazing experiment where he photographed the watercrystals after labeling the water (frozen at a particular temperature) filledglass tumblers with words having positive and negative energy. The images of thecrystals formed in water labeled with thank you in several languages were foundto be breathtakingly beautiful.“If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life isThank you, it will be enough” - Meister EckhartI sincerely thank and deeply love and respect Ma Suraja, Sandeep Goswamy, ShalinKaintal Khurana and Suresh Padmanabhan Sir amongst many others and themagnificent Divine energy watching over me and guiding me. My life is superspecial and I know I have miles to go, many more lives to touch and empower.Looking forward to being of service and being grateful for much more.Nidhi Chauhan Sharma is a Delhi Based Quantum Tarot Card Reader, ThetaHealer & Energy Healernidhi.chauhan@yahoo.co.in [nidhi.chauhan@yahoo.co.in] "},{"pageContent":" Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 1.08.25 pm.png [../images/00069.jpeg] SPIRITUAL JOURNEY WITH ANIMALS Ritambhara Nand Did you know that our Animal Companion has the powerto lead and bring us in harmony with our own self?The idea of existence is simple yet extraordinary for me. The energy exists allaround in form of trees, small plants, ants, birds, animals on street, evenrocks found around the tree. All we need is a process that fine-tunes ourconsciousness with Universal Consciousness in a perfect setting.I always felt the need to understand the deeper dimensions of energy and whatleads us from one circumstance to another. Various energy driven therapies willhelp you come closer to the SOURCe. But finally, one needs to connect the dotsand understanding the real essence of synchronicity.I work as Tarot Card Reader& Body worker. I blend both of these to give abeautiful synthesis of gross body and subtle body. Tarot as an energetic Toolhelps you receive answers from Universal Consciousness whereas the DynamicBalancing (Body work) helps you come in contact with the energetic movementswithin your body. Now, this is a single unifying point where one feels at easeand bliss.But my journey was enhanced as a beautiful cat came into my life. She broughtalong immense discoveries. My connection with her was established from the firstmoment. But our association led me to discover hidden principles of energy. Shewas keen to show me the path while I was taking time to open up and receive allthe beautiful messages from the Unconscious realm.When I travelled on the path of interacting with animals, the transformationoccurred at many levels. It is not something spiritual or psychological orphysiological. Instead we can experience expansion of energy in all thedirections simply because we consciously enter into a different realm. Ourability to reconnect with the animal companion restores our spiritual powerwhile we also have a direct access to the wisdom of other compassionate beings!It is said that Man Once Spoke with Animals till he placed himself as themaster of Earth, having dominion over all other things.We are here dealing with energetic beings that live in glory of nature; theydeeply follow their natural instincts. When we travel with them, we work towardsmaking our life as authentic as theirs. There are many times that you feel theneed to simplify life. You will find many complexities around. Thesecomplexities create all the problems.To size up, let us say that these problems arise out of contradictions betweenfeelings of heart and the actions that we take, whereas when we see the animals,we see a whole and united being. There is no duality in their feelings andbehavior.I totally believe that the animals are a reflection of your deepest self andalso represent qualities you need in this world. Therefore, when you travel onthe path of establishing a ‘Healing Touch’ with Animals, it becomes a part ofyou for life and reflects your inner-spiritual self!Some of powerful discoveries that I came across were—Animals are wondrous happy creatures. They love and defend one another. Theyeven feel sorrow and melancholy. Yet there has never been war between animalspecies. They know nothing about greed, envy and hate. They live their entirelives without sin. They have many amazing powers and use those only to benefittheir kind and not to overcome their opponents.Can we see the reason why Creator put all of us together on the same planet?A part of that reason is to learn from one another. Animals are here to teachhumans. They have many powerful teachings to give!They are extremely in-tune with nature and the ebbs and flows of the seasons.They communicate with the sun, with the moon, with the stars – and thiscommunication is communication of energy. They take energy; they give energy.There is a delicate transfer of energy happening everywhere. All we need to dois simply be ‘Available to the Source’.When interacting with Animals, we are plunging into collective consciousness. Alot of wonderful things can happen. For me, the biggest take-away was beingsensitive to warmth, creativity, higher consciousness and awareness!Honor the process of establishing a bond with Animal Companion. They will helpyou to be grounded, to be present and establish a delicate balance in the energysystems.“If the vibrations of existence come within one’s grasp, if there is ano-thought state on both sides, then there is no need to talk. The communicationtakes place on a very intimate level, and this communication goes straight tothe heart. there is no explaining because there is no way to explain. Then youalso will not waver over whether this or that will be or will not be. Your beingwill directly know what has happened”“It is not necessarily the case that only human beings are reached by thevibrations of the fifth body. There is a wonderful phenomenon in the life ofMahavira: it is said that even animals attended his gatherings. Jaina monks havebeen unable to explain this phenomenon and they never will. Now an animal doesnot understand human language but it understands the language of being verywell”.“If I sit in a no-thought condition near a cat, the cat is already in the stateof no- thought. With you, however, I will have to talk. To take you to the cat’sstate of no-thought is a very long journey. Animals, plants and even stonesunderstand the vibrations that begin from the spiritual body; there is nodifficulty in that”. - OshoWhile traveling the powerful journey with Animal Kingdom, one direction lead toanother and the 5-step process came down as a gift to me! ‘Veterinary HealingArt’ is our initiative to establish a sacred bond with animal companion.• Your ability to connect deeply with animals will restore great balance andharmony in your life.• As a result of deep association with animals, you will receive sacred messagesfrom the source itself. You will be protected as well as gifted with talents andstrengths.• It will help you re-establish your own relationship with other humancompanions around you.The foundation of this therapy is based on the single factor that we all are apart of one Source.even the current understanding of Physics suggests thatanybody who can relax, clear their mind and envision being in different way ---such as successful, healthy, wise – can quantum jump.Develop a spiritual rapport with pets to overcome the language barriers and havea life-long friendship full of joy and understanding!Ritambhara is a Veterinary Healing Artist, Tarot Reader & Coach for ConsciousLiving.

It might not be seen as a very long timebut till this moment, and as I continue ahead to live each day with immenseself- love and appreciation, I feel every moment has been a sheer bliss!I faced some difficulty to write down this one. My inability to put it across onpaper comes from the fact that each moment was such a deep transformation thatit surpasses any description through words. I experienced a complete shift in my‘being’.A Delhi-based girl who intends to have a fabulous lifestyle; shopping freak anda set of friends who were make-believe.In all its uniqueness, I was still justanother person living and being influenced by the regular everyday energies thatinfluence the mainstream.How far is it going to go when I sit by myself thinkingof all the gap years and endless question marks even after five years of studyin psychology? emotional upheaval and turmoil, loss of loved one, self-depreciation and immense suspicion on how am I going to relate with others. Eachexperience just added more tussle in mind. It is now that I realize, I was doingnothing but expanding the same state of mind with which I was moving ahead! Newjobs, relationships, all caught my attention. There I was, going for all of it,but doing nothing and finally touching the ground! Now, the only choice was justto move upwards.As I write this article, I narrate the beautiful journey with my organization. Iwitnessed it unfolding for me and within me; not occasionally, not often, butevery single time. Just watching itself brought me into a new light. Everyorganization offers certain traits that one carries ahead in life. My workenvironment offers a relaxed gentility of power flowing within and beneath theaction. The inner purpose emerged as the outer purpose collapsed and the shellof ego began to open. The past few months have been marked by breaking of oldstructures, dependencies and fears. What remained behind was the unique,undiluted self!Being a student of Psychology, I came across the whole arena of human behavior.The study, the theories, tests, further evaluations about a particular disorderand the resultant behavior. And then I came across yet another dimension. Studyof Mind, Body and Soul in a way that I had never been introduced to! There havebeen healing forces that can be traced to shape, quality and combination. Pastwork experience left me with a cloud of no apprehension, no worry, no passion tofollow and no reason to conquer the world!But that almost seems like anotherlifetime. Today, I work as coordinator for The NewAge Foundation. Ourorganization has been working towards teaching various alternative healingmodalities, conducting self-growth programs and spiritual retreats. I attendedcalls and laid down description about the programs. It might seem ratherconfusing but my first step towards an inner growth began while trying toestablish a communication with people over the phone. Days passed and eventuallyI found myself floating on a whirlpool of questions. My insight on humanbehavior grew deeper as I tried understood their queries, beliefs and reasonsfor attending any of these workshop. Some were thoroughly distressed and seekhelp while others were just skeptical or/and under denial and a lot of them justwanted to share their success story. They were all in desperate need ‘to beheard’. This is when I could let go off my ‘Silence mode’ because I finallybalanced my belief that it was “ok to be heard”. My inability to express wasadding more to my trauma. I choked with my own words and uttered some when Ifelt that ‘it is safe to express’. The reason was an unduly desire to beappreciated and accepted, born out of childhood issues, past life or some otherreason that need not be mentioned. I learned that one lifetime was too less tobalance out or unlearn or drop the baggage. Therefore, I do not feel tempted torelive the past, unless it’s a revelation that will facilitate my growth. Now,my only reason to wake up next morning is to explore more of me as I am theextension of ever expanding Universe!Honestly, there were times when I was tempted to fall back on the old pattern.Connecting to my higher self wasn’t a cakewalk but I moved ahead with the onlytool called “willingness”. It has been a gradual process and I could feel thatlight filtering through me. When I looked deep, I saw a scarcity, an unfulfilledexpression with my own self that manifested as unpleasant emotions at consciouslevel. We feel insecure in our relationships, desperate to fulfill ourdesires/goals, in failure to do the same, we get depressed, judge or push itbeneath the carpet. We abide by society yet swear by it when we face resentment.None of the experiments done in college or internships done under psychologistcould bring me this clarity over the years! One of my major breakthrough tookplace in a workshop that brings you to the core (we call it The Money workshop).It was flow of mountain stream that surely awakened my soul from heavy labor!Universe works on absolute simple laws; while us being just one of the componentof it, complicate our life. That moment I expanded to become the sky, the earth,the oceans and forest too! My Journey began as I lived each moment with completeawareness. There were infinite possibilities and every scope to unlearn and thenre-learn. I did not resist as I choose to reprogram myself with a new beliefthat,“I have the power to create an effortless life for myself”. I bow down tomy Mentors who guided me on various dimensions of energy. These learning orexperiences were not random but instead synchronistic. By paying attention tothese synchronicities, I immersed a layer deeper. My learning just went aheadindicating that there is no beginning and no end, but expansion always. Presenceof Mentors was a blessing as they listened to me patiently, answered to all myquestions, kept holding my hand and walking by my side. They showed me the way,yet kept saying that “You are the one attracting all these beautifulexperiences”. Theyre-affirmed it again and again till I knew I was open and took100% responsibility for attracting all to my life. Now, I truly respect my pastexperiences as they empowered me to be who I am today; bitter and coldexperiences turned into rich and abundant learning. I was ready and therefore,what could have been normal experiences for others were producing breakthroughfor me! even though I was vulnerable and falling back to the old pattern, mymentors brought me close to the silent impulse of my heart. They walked up withme, and after a point left my hand, left me to find my own path, my own truth! Isaw myself floating. Each day is a new revelation, followed by an action.Today, I feel blissful as Tarot Card Reader and shaman by heart. Myunderstanding of life is born out of my own clarity and internal stability. Ibelieve in a rope of compassion that connects me to an individual, during asession. This rope eventually takes both of us deeper into our own self where wefind our answers. One surely experiences a deep seated Self empowerment by theend of the session!Tarot for me is a beautiful tool to look deeper into life and its dimensions. Isee it as a ‘window to existence’. So, in each session, the client and me willconsciously step in to the world of cleansing and transforming Life. Tarotopened the doors to possibilities that I thought never existed! During myjourney with tarot, I discovered a process called ‘Dynamic Balancing’. It allowsbody energy to flow, removing the blockages using Himalayan singing bowls andother Shamanic musical instruments.Finally, I knew that each of this process is opening the door for increasing the‘awareness towards our body’. We feel more sync-in with our emotions andbeliefs. We understand the design of Universe and see how our life fits intothis Jig-saw Puzzle. A combination of Tarot Reading and Dynamic Balancing hasbeen working as Diagnostic and Therapeutic Device. I intend to do this majesticwork till the end of my life!It is indeed a blessing when you see the world with a little more awareness andconsciousness that seeps into your system. The next moment, you see yourenthusiasm flowing into different directions bringing new explorations.‘Veterinary Healing Art’ is my journey with Animals. A five-step process thatintends to establish a sacred bond with an animal companion.I have deep love, faith and reverence for the great Master ‘Osho’ and my dearestMentors (Sandeep Goswamy and Suresh Padmanabhan). Through them, I got the firstglimpse of divinity while traveling through many unknown paths and opening manyunknown locks.
