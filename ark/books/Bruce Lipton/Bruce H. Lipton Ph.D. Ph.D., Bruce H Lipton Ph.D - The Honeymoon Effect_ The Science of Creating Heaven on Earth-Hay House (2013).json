I’ve read it twice, and I loved every minute I spent with it. One ofmy favorite reads ever.”—Dr. Wayne W. Dyer“Bruce Lipton has written the single best book on love—both personal andplanetary—that I’ve ever read. And I’ve read a lot of them! I know Bruce and hisbeloved Margaret up close and personal. Their relationship is joyful, nurturing,creative, and contagious. They live in Heaven on Earth and so can you. Bruceuses the principles of the New Science he champions to enlighten, explain, andencourage us all to embody the love that we’ve always wanted.”—Joan Borysenko, Ph.D.,biologist, psychologist, and best-selling author of Minding the Body, Mendingthe Mind“The Honeymoon Effect brings the magic of loving relationships right down to acellular level and teaches us how to create them for ourselves.”—Christiane Northrup, M.D., OB/GYN physician and author of the New York Timesbestsellers Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom and The Wisdom of Menopause“If you’ve ever wondered why an exciting, new relationship loses its magic andshine, you’ll want to read this book. By understanding the science behind how werelate to others, and learning the strategies to successfully connect in thebest possible way, The Honeymoon Effect is sure to bring the luster and lifeback to the relationships that matter most.”—Cheryl Richardson, author of You Can Create an Exceptional Life, The Art ofExtreme Self-Care, The Unmistakable Touch of Grace, Stand Up for Your Life, LifeMakeovers, and Take Time for Your Life“What a pleasure to read Bruce’s entertaining romp through the science of lovingrelationships! Bruce makes it clear that couples can learn a lot from thequantum physics, biochemistry, and psychology that promote conscious, lovingrelationships. Great reading for anyone who wants to bring a loving relationshipinto his or her life—or maintain one that already exists.”—Gay Hendricks, Ph.D., author of The Big Leap and (with Dr. Kathlyn Hendricks)Conscious Loving“The Honeymoon Effect is a must-read for every couple striving to create loveand trust in their relationship. Bruce’s readable explanation of the sciencebehind the magic of love is engaging, inspiring, and, most of all,enlightening!”—Arielle Ford, author of Wabi Sabi Love“A brilliant and cohesive explanation of how we fall in love—and how we lose itonce the Honeymoon Effect passes. Happily, Lipton gives us an equally clearexplanation of how we can modify our subconscious programming and transform ourmost fundamental patterns in order to reclaim the Honeymoon Effect in all ourrelationships for the rest of our lives. Lipton draws on cell biology, the studyof noble gases, and conscious parenting (among other things) to make his points,yet brings a lighthearted simplicity that is both joyful and profound in itsimplications. As with all of Lipton’s work, this book delivers!”—Nicki Scully, author of Alchemical Healing and Planetary Healing"},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00002.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"ALSO BY BRUCE H.

I thought lovewas a myth dreamed up by poets and Hollywood producers to make people feel badabout what they could never have. Everlasting love? Happily Ever After? Forgetabout it.Like everyone, I was programmed in a way that enabled some things in my life tocome naturally. My programming emphasized the importance of education. To myparents, the value of an education was the difference between the life of aditchdigger just getting by and a white-collar executive with soft hands and asoft life. They were clearly of the opinion that “You cannot amount to anythingin this world without an education.”Given their beliefs, unsurprisingly, my parents held nothing back when it cameto expanding my educational horizons. I vividly recall coming home from Mrs.Novak’s second-grade class thrilled by my first look into the amazingmicroscopic world of single-celled amoebas and beautiful unicellular algae likethe fascinatingly named spirogyra. I burst into the house and begged my motherfor a microscope of my own. Without any hesitation, she immediately drove me tothe store and bought me my first microscope. This was clearly not the sameresponse to the tantrum I had thrown over my desperate desire to get a RoyRogers cowboy hat, six-shooter, and holster!Despite my Roy Rogers phase, it was Albert Einstein who became the iconic heroof my youth: my Mickey Mantle, Cary Grant, and Elvis Presley all rolled into onegiant personality. I always loved the photo that showed him sticking out histongue, his head covered with an exploding shock of white hair. I also lovedseeing Einstein on the tiny screen of the (newly invented) television in ourliving room where he appeared as a loving, wise, and playful grandparent.Most of all, I took great pride in the fact that Einstein, a Jewish immigrantlike my father, overcame prejudice through his scientific brilliance. At timeswhile growing up in Westchester County, New York, I felt like an outcast; therewere parents in our town who refused to allow me to play with their kids lest Ispread “Bolshevism” to them. It gave me a feeling of pride and security to knowthat Einstein, far from being an outcast, was a Jewish man who was respected andhonored around the world.Good teachers, my education-is-all family, and my passion for spending hours atmy microscope led to a Ph.D. in cell biology and a tenured position at theUniversity of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Ironically, it wasonly when I left my position there to explore the “new science,” includingstudies on quantum mechanics, that I began to understand the profound nature ofmy boyhood hero Einstein’s contributions to our world.While I flourished academically, in other areas I was a poster child fordysfunction, especially in the realm of relationships. I married in my 20s whenI was too young and too emotionally immature to be ready for a meaningfulrelationship. When after ten years of marriage I told my father I was gettingdivorced, he adamantly argued against it and told me, “Marriage is a business.”In hindsight, my father’s response made sense for someone who emigrated in 1919from a Russia engulfed in famine, pogroms, and revolution—life for my father andhis family was unimaginably hard, and survival was always in question.Consequently, my father’s definition of a relationship was a working partnershipin which marriage was a means of survival, similar to the recruitment ofmail-order brides by hardscrabble pioneers who homesteaded the Wild West in the1800s.My parents’ marriage echoed my father’s “business first” attitude even though mymother, who was born in America, did not share his philosophy. My mother andfather worked together six days a week in a successful family business, but noneof their children can recall seeing them share a kiss or a romantic moment. As Ientered my early teens, the dissolution of their marriage became apparent whenmy mother’s anger over a loveless relationship exacerbated my father’s drinking.My younger brother and sister and I hid in our closets as frequent verballyabusive arguments shattered our formerly peaceful home. When my father andmother finally decided to live in separate bedrooms, an uneasy truce prevailed.As many conventionally unhappy parents did in the 1950s, my parents stayedtogether for the sake of the children—they divorced after my youngest brotherleft home for college. I only wish they had known that modeling theirdysfunctional relationship was far more damaging to their children than theirseparation would have been.At the time, I blamed my father for our dysfunctional family life. But withmaturity I came to realize that both of my parents were equally responsible forthe disaster that sabotaged their relationship and our family harmony. Moreimportant, I began to see how their behavior, programmed into my subconsciousmind, influenced and undermined my efforts to create loving relationships withthe women in my life.In the meantime I experienced years of pain. The dissolution of my own marriagewas emotionally devastating, especially because my two wonderful daughters, nowloving and accomplished women, were just little girls. It was so devastatingthat I vowed never to marry again. Convinced that true love was a myth—at leastfor me—every day for 17 years I repeated this mantra when I shaved: “I won’t getmarried again. I won’t get married again.”Needless to say, I wasn’t committed-relationship material! But despite mymorning ritual, I couldn’t ignore what is a biological imperative for allorganisms, from single cells to our 50-trillion-celled bodies—the drive toconnect with another organism.The first Big Love I experienced was a cliché: an older man with a bad case ofarrested emotional development falls in love with a younger woman andexperiences an intense, hormone-driven, teenage-style affair. For a year Ifloated happily through life high on “love potions,” the neurochemicals andhormones coursing through my blood that you’ll read about in Chapter 3[part0011.html]. When my teenage-style love affair inevitably crashed and burned(saying she needed “space,” she rode her bicycle a very short space away intothe arms of a cardiovascular surgeon), I spent a year in my big, empty housewallowing in pain and pining for the woman who had left me. Cold turkey ishorrible, not just for heroin addicts but also for those whose biochemistryreverts to everyday hormones and neurochemicals in the wake of a failed loveaffair.One cold Wisconsin winter day I was sitting alone (as usual), ruminating againabout the woman who had left me. I suddenly thought, Goddammit, leave me alone!A wise voice that occasionally appears at pivotal times of my life responded,“Bruce, isn’t that exactly what she did?” I burst out laughing and that brokethe spell. From then on, any time I started obsessing, I would laugh. Finally, Ihad gotten past withdrawal through laughter, though I still had a long way to goto get my act together!How far I was from getting my act together became crystal clear to me when Imoved to the Caribbean to teach at an offshore medical school. I was living inthe most beautiful place on Earth in a villa by the ocean with gorgeous,sweet-smelling flowers; the villa even came with a gardener and a cook. I wantedto share my new life with someone (though of course not get married—I was stillfixated on my morning mantra). I wanted more than a sexual partner. I wantedsomeone I could share my new life with in the most beautiful place on Earth. Butthe harder I looked, the less I found, even though I had what I thought was theworld’s best pickup line: “If you’re not doing anything, how about hanging outwith me at my Caribbean villa?”One night I tried what should have been my surefire pickup line on a woman whohad just arrived on Grenada, the picture-perfect island I had come to love. Wewent to the yacht club bar and chatted. I thought she was interesting, so Iasked her to stay for a while instead of going back to her job working on ayacht. She looked me in the eye and said, “No, I could never be with you. You’retoo needy.” The bullet hit—I was blown back into my chair in silence. After along, stunned moment, I recovered my speech and managed to say, “Thank you. Ineeded to hear that.” Not only did I know she was right; I knew that I needed toget my own life together before I could have the truly loving relationship I sodesperately wanted.Then a funny thing happened: as soon as I let go of my desperate quest for arelationship, women who wanted a relationship with me started to appear in mylife. Finally, the true inspiration for this book, my beloved Margaret, enteredmy life and we started living our lives like those portrayed in the romanticcomedies I once dismissed as fantasy.But that’s getting ahead of the story. First I had to learn that I was not“fated” to be alone, that I was not “fated” to have to settle for a series offailed relationships. I had to learn that not only had I created every failedrelationship in my life, I could create the wonderful relationship I wanted!The first step began in the Caribbean when I experienced the scientific epiphanyI described in my first book, The Biology of Belief. While mulling over myresearch on cells, I realized that cells are not controlled by genes and neitherare we. That eureka instant was the beginning of my transition, as I chronicledin that book, from an agnostic scientist into a Rumi-quoting scientist whobelieves that we all have the capacity to create our own Heaven on Earth andthat eternal life transcends the body.That instant was also the beginning of my transition from a marriage-phobicskeptic into an adult who finally took responsibility for every failedrelationship in his life and realized he could create the relationship of hisdreams. In this book, I’ll chronicle that transition using some of the samescience outlined in The Biology of Belief (and more). I’ll explain why it is notyour hormones, your neurochemicals, your genes, or your less-than-idealupbringing that prevents you from creating the relationships you say you want.Your beliefs are preventing you from experiencing those elusive, lovingrelationships. Change your beliefs, change your relationships.Of course, it’s more complicated than that, because in relationships between twopeople there are actually four minds at work. Unless you understand how thosefour minds can work against one another, even with the best of intentions,you’ll be “looking for love in all the wrong places.” That’s why self-help booksand therapy so often foster insight but not actual change—they only deal withtwo of the four minds at work in relationships!Think back to the most spectacular love affair of your life—the Big One thattoppled you head over heels. You made love for days on end, didn’t need food,barely needed water, and had endless energy: it was the Honeymoon Effect thatwas to last forever. So often, though, the honeymoon devolves into dailybickering, maybe divorce, or just tolerance. The good news is that it doesn’thave to end that way.You might think that your Big Love was a coincidence at best or a delusion atworst, and that the collapse of your Big Love was bad luck. But in this book,I’ll explain how you created the Honeymoon Effect in your life and its demise aswell. Once you know how you created it and how you lost it, you can, like me,quit whining about your bad karma in relationships and create ahappily-ever-after relationship that even a Hollywood producer would love.After decades of failure, that’s what I finally manifested! Because so manypeople have asked how we did it, Margaret and I will explain in the Epilogue howwe’ve managed to create our happily-ever-after Honeymoon Effect for 17 years andcounting. We want to share our story because love is the most potent growthfactor for human beings, and love is contagious! As you’ll find when you createthe Honeymoon Effect in your own life, you’ll attract similarly loving people toyou—and the more the merrier. Let’s take Rumi’s eight-centuries-old advice andrevel in our love for one another so this planet can finally evolve into abetter place where all organisms can live their own Heaven on Earth. My hope isthat this book will launch you on a journey, as that instant in the Caribbeanlaunched me, to create the Honeymoon Effect each and every day of your life."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]CHAPTER 1 [part0006.html#vk2]Our Drive to Bond [part0006.html#vk2]It is beyond our imagination to conceive of a single form of life that existsalone and independent, unattached to other forms.—LEWIS THOMASIf you’re a survivor of multiple failed relationships, you may wonder why youkeep trying. I can assure you that you don’t persist just for the (sometimesshort-lived) good times. And you don’t persist because of TV ads featuringloving couples on tropical islands. You persist, despite your track record anddespite dismal divorce statistics, because you are designed to bond. Humanbeings are not meant to live alone.There is a fundamental biological imperative that propels you and every organismon this planet to be in a community, to be in relationship with other organisms.Whether you’re thinking about it consciously or not, your biology is pushing youto bond. In fact, the coming together of individuals in community (starting withtwo) is a principle force that drives biological evolution, a phenomenon I callspontaneous evolution, which I cover in depth in the book of the same name.1[part0018.html#ch01_1]There are, of course, additional biological imperatives designed to ensureindividual and species survival: the drive for food, for sex, for growth, forprotection, and the ferocious, inexplicable drive to fight for life. We don’tknow where or how the will to live is programmed into cells, but it is a factthat no organism will readily give up its life. Try to kill the most primitiveof organisms and that bacterium doesn’t say, “Okay, I’ll wait until you killme.” Instead, it will make every evasive maneuver in its power to sustain itssurvival.When our biological drives are not being fulfilled, when our survival isthreatened, we get a feeling in the pit of our stomach that something is wrongeven before our conscious minds comprehend the danger. That gut feeling is beingfelt globally right now—many of us are feeling that pit in our stomach as weponder the survivability of our environmentally damaged planet and of the humanbeings who have damaged it. Most of this book focuses on how individuals cancreate or rekindle wonderful relationships, but in the final chapter I’llexplain how the energy created by “Heaven on Earth” relationships can heal theplanet and save our species.That’s a tall order, I know, but we have at hand an extremely successful modelfor creating healing relationships that will ultimately lead to the healing ofour planet. As the ancient mystics have said, “The answers lie within.” Thenature and power of harmonious relationships can be seen in the community of thetrillions of cells that cooperate to form every human being. This might at firstseem strange to you because when you look in the mirror, you might logicallyconclude that you are a single entity. But that is a major misperception! Ahuman being is actually a community made up of 50 trillion sentient cells withina skin-covered petri dish, a surprising insight I’ll explain further in Chapter3 [part0011.html].As a cell biologist, I spent many hours happily studying the behavior and fateof stem cells in plastic culture dishes. The trillions of cells within eachskin-covered human body live far more harmoniously than feuding couples andstrife-ridden human communities. This is one excellent reason why we can learnvaluable insights from them: 50 trillion sentient cells, 50 trillion citizensliving together peacefully in a remarkably complex community. All the cells havejobs. All the cells have health care, protection, and a viable economy (based onan exchange of ATP molecules, units of energy biologists often refer to as the“coin of the realm”). In comparison, humanity’s job—figuring out the logisticsof how a relatively measly seven billion humans can work together inharmony—looks easy. And compared to the 50-trillion-celled-cooperative humancommunity, each couple’s job—figuring out how two human beings can communicateand work together in harmony—seems like a piece of cake (though I know that attimes it seems like the hardest challenge we face on Earth).I grant you that single-celled organisms, which were the first life forms onthis planet, spent a lot of time—almost three billion years—figuring out how tobond with one another. Even I didn’t take that long! And when they did startcoming together to create multicellular life forms, they initially organized asloose communities, or “colonies,” of single-celled organisms. But theevolutionary advantage of living in a community (more awareness of theenvironment and a shared workload) soon led to highly structured organismscomposed of millions, billions, and then trillions of socially interactivesingle cells.These multicellular communities range in size from the microscopic to thoseeasily seen by the naked eye: a bacterium, an amoeba, an ant, a dog, a humanbeing, and so on. Yes, even bacteria do not live alone; they form dispersedcommunities that keep in constant communication via chemical signals andviruses.Once cells figured out a way to work together to create organisms of all sizesand shapes, the newly evolved multicellular organisms also started to assembleinto communities themselves. For example, on the macro level, the aspen tree(Populus tremuloides) forms a superorganism made up of large stands ofgenetically identical trees (technically, stems) connected by a singleunderground root system. The largest known, fully connected aspen is a 106-acregrove in Utah nicknamed Pando that some experts contend is the largest organismin the world.The social nature of harmonious multiorganism societies can provide fundamentalinsights directly applicable to human civilization. One great example is an ant,which, like a human being, is a multicellular social organism; when you take anant out of its community it will die. In fact, an individual ant is really asuborganism; the true organism is actually represented by the ant colony. LewisThomas described ants this way: “Ants are so much like human beings as to be anembarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies intowar, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse enemies, capture slaves … engagein child labor … exchange information ceaselessly. They do everything but watchtelevision.”2 [part0018.html#ch01_2]Nature’s drive to form community is also easy to observe in mammalian species,such as horses. Rambunctious colts run around and irritate their parents just ashuman children can. To get the colts in line, their parents nip their offspringas a form of negative reinforcement. If those little bites don’t work, theparents move on to the most effective punishment of all—they force themisbehaving colt out of the group and do not let it return to the community.That turns out to be the ultimate punishment for even the friskiest, leastcontrollable colt, which will do anything in its behavioral capacity to rejointhe community.As for human communities, we can fend for ourselves as individuals longer than asingle ant can, but we’re likely to go crazy in the process. I’m reminded of themovie Cast Away, in which Tom Hanks plays a man who is marooned on an island inthe South Pacific. He uses his own bloody hand to imprint a face on a WilsonSporting Goods volleyball he calls “Wilson” so he can have someone to talk to.Finally, after four years, he takes the risky step of venturing off the islandin a makeshift raft because he’d rather die trying to find someone tocommunicate with than stay by himself on the island, even though he has figuredout how to secure food and drink—that is, how to survive.Most people think that the drive to propagate is the most fundamental biologicalimperative for humans, and there’s no doubt that reproduction of the individualis fundamental to species survival. That’s why for most of us sex is sopleasurable—Nature wanted to ensure that humans have the desire to procreate andsustain the species. But Hanks doesn’t venture off the island to propagate; heventures off the island to communicate with someone other than a volleyball.For humans, coming together in pairs (biologists call it “pair coupling”) isabout more than sex for propagation. In a lecture entitled “The Uniqueness ofHumans,” neurobiologist and primatologist Robert M. Sapolsky explains how uniquehumans are in this regard:Some of the time, though, the challenge is we’re dealing with something where weare simply unique—there is no precedent out there in the animal world. Let megive you an example of this. A shocking one. Okay. You have a couple. They comehome at the end of the day. They talk. They eat dinner. They talk. They go tobed. They have sex. They talk some more. They go to sleep. The next day they dothe same exact thing. They come home from work. They talk. They eat. They talk.They go to bed. They have sex. They talk. They fall asleep. They do this everyday for 30 days running. A giraffe would be repulsed by this. Hardly anybody outthere has non-reproductive sex day after day and nobody talks about itafterward.3 [part0018.html#ch01_3]For humans, sex for propagation is crucial until a population stabilizes. Whenhuman populations reach a state of balance and security, sex for propagationdecreases. In the United States, where most parents expect their children tosurvive and also expect that they themselves won’t be out on the streets with acup when they’re old, the average number of offspring per family is fewer thantwo. However, any population that is threatened will initiate reproductionearlier and reproduce more—they’re unconsciously doing the calculation that someof their children are not going to survive and that they’ll need more than twochildren to share the load of helping to support them when they’re old. InIndia, for example, though the fertility rate dropped 19 percent in a decade to2.2, in the poorest areas where families face tremendous challenges to survive,the rate can be three times higher.But even in societies where the drive to reproduce is curtailed, there is stillan incentive for coupling because the drive to bond trumps the drive toprocreate. Couples who don’t have children can create wonderful relationships,and many make a conscious decision not to have children. In Two Is Enough: ACouple’s Guide to Living Childless by Choice, author Laura S. Scott explores whysome forgo the experience. Scott starts off the book with a conversation with afriend’s husband, who was at the time a new dad:“So why did you get married if you didn’t want kids?” Huh? Love … companionship,I blurted. His question startled me, rendering me uncharacteristically short ofwords … He cocked his head and waited for more, his curiosity genuine. In thatmoment, I recognized just how strange I must have seemed to him. Here was aperson who could not imagine life without kids trying to understand a person whocould not imagine a life with kids.4 [part0018.html#ch01_4]Scott started researching the subject and found that according to a 2000 CurrentPopulation Survey, 30 million married couples in the United States do not havechildren and that the United States Census Bureau predicted that married coupleswith children would account for only 20 percent of households by 2010.5[part0018.html#ch01_5] Scott also did her own survey of couples who arechildless by choice and found that one important motive for not having childrenwas how much the couples valued their relationships. Said one of the surveyedhusbands, “We have a happy, loving, fulfilling relationship as we are now. It’sreassuring to think that the dynamic of my relationship with my wife won’tchange.”6 [part0018.html#ch01_6]Perhaps if more people realized that coupling in higher organisms isfundamentally about bonding, not only about the drive to reproduce, there wouldbe less prejudice against homosexuality. In fact, homosexuality is natural andcommon in the animal kingdom. In a 2009 review of the scientific literature,University of California at Riverside biologists Nathan W. Bailey and MarleneZuk, who advocate more study about the evolutionary impetus for homosexualbehavior, state, “The variety and ubiquity of same-sex sexual behavior inanimals is impressive; many thousands of instances of same-sex courtship, pairbonding and copulation have been observed in a wide range of species, includingmammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, mollusks, and nematodes.”7[part0018.html#ch01_7] One example is silver gulls; 21 percent of female silvergulls pair with another female at least once in their lifetimes and 10 percentare exclusively lesbian.8 [part0018.html#ch01_8]Since we’re driven to form bonds, whether they are homosexual or heterosexual,we need to understand how Nature intended us to bond, which is the topic of thisbook. Until we successfully learn how to couple, how can we follow the exampleof cells to create larger cooperative communities? Until we successfully learnhow to couple better, the next stage of our evolution, wherein humans assembleto form the larger superorganism humanity, is stalled. If ants can do it, so canwe humans!The good news is that the story of evolution is not only a story of the survivalof cooperative communities but also a story of repeating patterns that can beunderstood through geometry, the mathematics of putting structure into space.Humans didn’t create geometry—they derived it from studying the structure of theUniverse because it provides a way of understanding the organization of Nature.As Plato wrote, “Geometry existed before creation.”The repeating patterns of the new geometry, fractal geometry, reveal asurprising insight into the nature of the Universe’s structure. Even though weknow in the pit of our stomach that we are at a crisis point, fractal geometrymakes it clear, as I’ll explain later, that the planet has been in dire straitsbefore. Each time, though there were casualties along the way (most notoriouslydinosaurs), something better emerged out of the crisis.The mathematical computations involved in fractal geometry are actually quitesimple; equations use only multiplication, addition, and subtraction. When oneof these equations is solved, the answer is reinserted into the originalequation and solved again. This “recursive” pattern can be repeated infinitely.When fractal equations are repeatedly solved more than a million times(computations made possible by the advent of powerful computers), visualgeometric patterns emerge. It turns out that an inherent characteristic offractal geometry is the creation of ever-repeating, “self-similar” patternsnested within one another. The traditional Russian matryoshka doll provides agreat image for understanding fractal patterns. A symbol of motherhood andfertility, the doll is actually a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size thatnest into each other. Each doll is a miniature though not necessarily exactreplica of the larger ones.Just like Russian nesting dolls, the repeating patterns in Nature make itsfractal organization clear. For example, the pattern of twigs on a tree branchresembles the pattern of limbs branching off the trunk. The pattern of a majorriver is similar to the patterns of its smaller tributaries. In the human lung,the pattern of branching along the large bronchus airway is repeated in thesmaller bronchioles. No matter how complicated organisms are, they displayrepetitive patterns.These iterative patterns help make the natural world more comprehensible.Despite the evolution of increasing complexity in the structure of cooperativemulticellular communities, the amazing fact is that in the physiology ofhumans—the organisms that are presumably at the top of the evolutionaryladder—there are no new functions that aren’t already present in simple cells atthe bottom of the evolutionary ladder. Digestive, excretory, cardiovascular,nervous, and even immune systems are present in virtually all of the singlecells that comprise our bodies. Show me a function in your human body and I’llshow you where it originally arose in the single cell. These repeating fractalpatterns mean that everything we learn from Nature’s simple organisms applies tomore complex organisms as well as to us humans. So if you want to understand thenature of the Universe, you don’t have to take on the whole thing—you can studyits components as I did when I was a cell biologist. Fractal geometry’srepeating patterns provide a scientific framework for the principle that mysticscall “as above, so below.” We are clearly part of the Universe, not an add-onafterthought whose job is to “conquer” Nature.A biosphere built on the repetitive patterns of fractal geometry also offers anopportunity to predict the future of evolution by looking back on its history.In contrast, conventional Darwinian theory holds that evolution is initiated byrandom mutations, genetic “accidents,” which implies that we cannot predict thefuture. But following in the footsteps of cells, our future should be one ofmore and more cooperation and more and more harmony so that humans (startingwith pair-bonded twos) can learn to cooperate to form the larger evolvedcommunal organism defined as humanity.Instead of cursing our bad luck in relationships, we need to recognize that ourefforts at bonding are a fundamental drive of Nature and that these bonds can becooperative and harmonious. We need to heed Rumi’s sage advice: “Yesterday I wasclever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changingmyself.” When we start living in harmony with Nature (and with ourselves), wecan move on to creating the Honeymoon Effect in our lives, where relationshipsare based on love, cooperation, and communication. In the next chapter, we’llexplore the most fundamental form of communication among organisms: energyvibrations."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]CHAPTER 2 [part0006.html#vk3]Good Vibrations [part0006.html#vk3]I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in Nature, which, if we unconsciouslyyield to it, will direct us aright.—HENRY DAVID THOREAUI was living in paradise, away from the legal and financial battles that hadengulfed my life, when I made a mistake no self-respecting nonhuman mammal wouldever make. Does a gazelle hesitate when he/she senses the presence of a lioness?Does the gazelle amble over to her and ask, “Are you my friend?” Of course not.As soon as the gazelle senses a lioness’s presence, the gazelle makes tracks ata phenomenal speed—up to 50 miles per hour—to avoid becoming dinner.But when a human predator who made my skin crawl moved in two doors from me,what did I do? Take the olive-greenish tint of his skin as a warning? Take theuh-oh-there’s-no-escape-in-this-dark-alley pounding of my heart as a warning?Take the image of a devil that invariably came to me when I saw him as a sign tostay away?No. Instead, I worked very hard to talk myself out of my visceral abhorrence ofhim. After all, I was transitioning from agnostic professor to enlightenedspiritual scientist. I was focusing on positive thinking, which meant I didn’twant to think about or acknowledge the reality of human predators. I was alsotrying to focus on forgiveness. In addition to looking devilish to me, thisman’s physical appearance was very similar to that of a man who had dragged meinto a court battle, someone I thought at the time might turn around if Ifocused on forgiving him. (Short story. In this case it hasn’t worked yet.) Istruggled with my abhorrence by engaging in idle conversation with him—I workedat being verbally civil and succeeded. My mind rationalized the angst I feltevery time I saw him, viewing it as some form of New Age penance.About a year after I met my predator neighbor, the movers arrived to pack up mystuff for my move from Barbados to Grenada. When the medical school where I wasteaching had transferred me, I thought my beneficence had been rewarded in twoways. First and foremost, I was thrilled that I would never again have to seethe man who still made my skin crawl. Second, I thought that my instincts musthave been wrong because he showed up to help load all my possessions (minus onesuitcase for a quick trip back to the States), including my beloved high-endphotography equipment, onto the delivery truck. He wasn’t such a bad guy afterall, my rational mind was telling me. All the while, my still erraticallybehaving heart wanted to escape!The truth came crashing down when I flew back to the Caribbean and learned(after badgering the movers for several days) that my stuff was never going toarrive. My predator neighbor had gone to the delivery company’s office the dayafter I left Barbados, canceled the shipment, gotten a refund of my money,stolen all my stuff, and then vanished from Barbados. What was supposed to be alesson in forgiveness and positive thinking ended up being a lesson in how todeal with the loss of everything I owned. Again. That was the fourth and, Ihope, final time I lost all my possessions. Yes, I have had an eventful life!More important for this chapter, the loss of all my possessions was a painfullesson for me about the importance of trusting “bad vibes” and “good vibes.” Allorganisms on this planet use vibration (aka energy) as a primary means ofcommunication. I learned the hard way that ignoring this primary means ofcommunication is a huge mistake, one we humans make all the time. Essentially,we buy the Brooklyn Bridge even though on some level we know we’re being had. Weoverride our feelings when our rational minds focus on words, especially whenthey’re spoken by silver-tongued swindlers (or lovers).The problem with words, as much as I love them, is that they can cover up farmore reliable energetic communication. I once heard a line of dialogue in amovie at 3 A.M., just as I was starting to doze off, a line memorable enough tomake me happy I had stayed up half the night: “Language was designed to hidefeelings.” There was nothing my predator neighbor had said that would havetipped me off to his chosen career as a scam artist. There was nothing I saidthat would have tipped him off to the fact that I was on to him. Yet as much asI tried to talk myself out of it, on some level I knew because I could read hisenergy, his bad vibrations.To create the Honeymoon Effect in your life, you’ll need to take advantage ofyour wonderful innate gift, the ability to sense good and bad vibrations. And todo so you’ll likely have to overcome the programming you received in your youth,although that’s not the only programming you’ll have to undo, as I will explainin Chapter 4 [part0012.html].So many of us learned from a young age to ignore messages we receiveenergetically: “Don’t listen to your feelings. Listen to the words.” So we talkourselves out of what we know viscerally/energetically. We ignore warnings signslike He’s lying when he says he loves me. We feel guilty (as I did about mystrong dislike for my neighbor) so we rationalize, telling ourselves, I must bewrong because he’s saying all the right things, and, after all, I love him andlove conquers all. Or we ignore good vibrations. She’s really great, but itwould never work out because she’s not my type.If “reading” energetically transmitted messages sounds like woo-woo New Agespeak to you, it’s not. Actually it’s mainstream quantum physics—and yes, we’venow come to the real topic of this chapter! At one time reading others’ energywould have sounded woo-woo to me. Like most biologists of my generation, Iaccepted the principles of Newtonian physics that brilliantly measure anddescribe how the material universe works. When Newton showed that he was able topredict the movements of the solar system by using physical data only, leavingGod out of the equation, a rift opened up between science and religion. By thetime I was studying science, that rift had become enormous. Until recently, lifescientists generally focused on studying the physical realm and left theinvisible realm to followers of religion, of which I was not one.In retrospect, I can see that other scientists and I were incredibly naive tothink that the mechanics of the Universe could be explained using onlyhyperrational, traditional, Newtonian physics. As accurate as Newtonianprinciples are for the material world, they are just not enough to explain thisworld that includes good and bad vibes, miraculous remissions of disease,psychic communication, and the Honeymoon Effect.Like most biologists, I was slow to adapt to the post-Newtonian world. When Ifinally grappled with quantum physics, I realized that Max Planck, WernerHeisenberg, my childhood hero Albert Einstein, and other pioneering thinkershave given us a new physics that offers us a window on forces that we can’t seebut that are truly the stuff of life.What quantum physics teaches us is that everything we thought was physical isnot physical. Instead, everything in this Universe is made out of immaterialenergy, and everything radiates energy. It is a given fact of science that everyatom and every molecule both radiates and absorbs light (energy).1[part0018.html#ch02_1] Because all organisms are made out of atoms andmolecules, you and I and every living thing are radiating energy (“vibes”). Thatincludes my predator neighbor who was radiating the kind of energy I should haveknown to avoid!But, you protest, doesn’t the fact that you regularly stand on a stage andlecture about the Honeymoon Effect without falling through the stage demonstratethat you’re a physical being and that the stage you don’t fall through is amaterial substance?No and no! On stage, I’m standing on whirling vortices of energy, which is why Idon’t fall through (though I have fallen off, but that’s another story). Andwhen you look at me, the fact that you see a physical being is only an illusion.I don’t have any physical structure—what you’re seeing are photons of lightbouncing off me!Unless you’re already knowledgeable about quantum physics, I’m sure I haven’tconvinced you to give up your belief that we live in a material world. I grantyou that the principles of quantum physics are as strange as they are wondrous.So I’ll explain as best I can how it can be that the world we once thought of asmaterial is actually energetic.Originally, Newtonian physics held that the atom was the smallest particle ofthe Universe. In fact, the word atom comes from the Greek uncuttable. However,the year 1895 marked the beginning of a renaissance in physics that wouldforever change our understanding of the world. It was at this time thatphysicists began to discover that atoms are made up of even smaller particles.Electrons were discovered first, followed by protons and neutrons. Thesefundamental subatomic particles were then found to be made up of a gaggle ofeven smaller and strangely behaving particles that include bosons, fermions, andquarks. The discovery of these even smaller subatomic particles opened up thenew quantum realm, whose weird characteristics confounded the traditionalprinciples of Newtonian physics.The weirdest characteristic of quantum physics is that these smaller subatomicparticles are not made of matter—they are not physical at all. I love showingthe following image of the Newtonian atom versus the quantum atom.image [../images/00005.jpeg]The Newtonian atom on the left can easily be illustrated in a concrete mannerusing marbles and ball bearings—it’s the solar-system-like model on the leftthat you’ll recognize from school textbooks. The illustration of the “quantumatom” on the right looks like a mistake—it’s blank. That’s because quantumphysicists have learned that there is no physical substance inside atoms; thesubunits that comprise atoms are made out of extremely powerful invisible energyvortices, the equivalent of nanotornados, not tangible matter. Matter, as itturns out, is a strange form of energy: it is not physical.For those (including scientists) used to thinking of this world as a materialone, it’s a hard concept to get your head around. It may help to visualize theenergy comprising an atom as a tornado headed toward you as you speed yourPorsche down an open highway. The reason you see the tornado as a physicalstructure in the illustration below is because of the dust and rubble caught upin its whirlwind.image [../images/00006.jpeg]Filter all the dirt and debris out of the tornado, and as is revealed in theimage on the right, it would have no physical structure at all; it is “only” aninvisible energy force field. But just try to continue your joyride at 100 mph(or less) through the tornado’s energy field and you’ll experience its forcefirsthand. Your attempt to drive through the tornado would be as disastrous andfatal as crashing into a stone wall because the tornado’s energetic forceresists opposing forces (the speeding Porsche), just as physical matter (thewall) does. In fact, the forces generated by atomic “nanotornados” aresignificantly more powerful than those generated by Hurricane Katrina. Theseforces are the reason why, when I’m on stage, I don’t fall through. I’m standingon whirling vortices of the trillions of atomic nanotornados beneath my feet.So let’s follow this understanding of atoms to its logical conclusion. Atoms aremade out of vortices of energy. That means molecules, which are made up ofatoms, are vortices of energy as well; so cells, which are made up of molecules,are also vortices of energy; and finally, human beings, each of whom is made upof trillions of cells, are … vortices of energy. It is true that we look as ifwe are physical, but it is an illusion, a trick of the light—we are all energy!What does this have to do with our personal lives? Nothing, according toconventional physics courses that suggest that the principles of quantummechanics apply at only the subatomic level. But some physicists contend as I dothat the principles of quantum mechanics have profound implications for ourpersonal lives. Once we accept the fact that we are fundamentally energeticbeings inextricably connected to the vast, dynamic energetic field we are partof, we can no longer view ourselves as powerless, isolated individuals whohappen to have won the Darwinian evolutionary lottery. Just as mysticsthroughout history have told us, everything in the Universe is connected:“Enlightenment, for a wave in the ocean, is the moment the wave realizes that itis water,” says Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.To illustrate the mechanics of the invisible energy field of which we are a partand how those mechanics relate to our lives, I like to use familiar examplesfrom the visible world. When you drop two rocks into a pond, they createripples, miniature waves. The ripples are not the energy created by the droppedrocks; they are a physical complement of the shape of the invisible energy. Thewater ripples are created by the force of moving energy (remember thetornado-and-Porsche analogy), which shapes the water as it travels across thesurface of the pond.image [../images/00007.jpeg]The story of ripples: In Figure A, a fish is contemplating nibbling a worm whilea dropped rock is about to hit the surface of the water. After the rock hits thewater in Figure B, the rock’s kinetic energy is transferred to the water andradiates from the site of impact as a series of concentric ripples. The movingenergy shapes the water into miniature waves, but the water itself is not reallymoving. This is illustrated by the action of the fisherman’s bobber, which liftsup vertically and drops down as the waves pass (see arrow). The fact that thebobber does not move horizontally along with the ripples reveals that the waterbeneath the bobber is not moving. The outline of the ripples reveals thewavelike character of moving energy. Figure C shows the shape of the energywaves. The height and depth of the ripples reflect the power of the energy. Thebigger the dropped rock, the more energy it transfers to the water. The power ofthe energy, measured by the ripple’s magnitude, is referred to as the wave’samplitude (labeled A). The frequency of the energy, measured in hertz, isdetermined by the number of wave cycles generated per second.Now let’s perform two hypothetical experiments that clearly show how energyinteracts. First, drop two rocks of the same size, from the same height, and atexactly the same time into a pond. For this experiment, I’m interested in thepoint at which the ripples made by each of the two rocks converge. At one pointin their convergence, you’ll see that the power of the entangled energy waves isamplified because the height of the now combined waves is greater than theheights of the individual ripples that give rise to them. The additive power ofthe wave produced by two entangled energies, a phenomenon known as constructiveinterference because it amplifies the size of the wave, is illustrated below.image [../images/00008.jpeg]Constructive interference: In Figure 1 above, two sets of ripples are movingacross the surface of the water toward each other. As illustrated, both waves Aand B are moving toward each other with their ripples in phase. In this case,both waves are leading with their negative amplitude. Their cycle patterns arealigned; the waves are in phase (harmonic resonance). The waves merge togetherat the interface where two ripples meet. To illustrate the consequence of thismerger, the waves are drawn with one above the other in Figure 2. Where theamplitude of A is +1, the amplitude of B is also +1. Add the two together andthe resulting amplitude of the composite wave at that point is +2. Likewise,where A is –1 so is B; together the total amplitude will be –2. The higheramplitude composite wave illustrated in Figure 3 represents an example ofconstructive interference.For the second experiment, drop one rock slightly later than its twin. This timeyou won’t see the amplification of energy where you saw it in the firstexperiment because the energy waves are out of sync—they are not in harmony;when one wave is going up, the other is going down. These out-of-phase energywaves cancel each other out; instead of the energy doubling, it is dissipatedand, as you’ll see in the following chart, instead of waves rising at the pointof convergence, the water is calm there. This phenomenon of canceling energywaves is called destructive interference because it diminishes the size of thewave.image [../images/00009.jpeg]Destructive interference: In Figure 1, the ripples derived from the first rock,labeled as Wave A, are moving from left to right. Wave B, moving right to left,represents the ripples from a second rock dropped shortly after the first. Sincethe rocks did not hit the water at the same time, the waves will not be alignedwhen they merge at the interface; they will be out of phase. In theillustration, Wave A is leading with a negative amplitude and Wave B is leadingwith a positive amplitude. Where they meet in Figure 2, the waves are mirrorimages of each other; the high amplitude (+1) of one wave is aligned with thelow amplitude (-1) of the other, and vice versa. As shown in Figure 3, theamplitude values of each wave cancel each other out, so the composite wave thathas 0 amplitude is no wave at all … it’s flat! The canceled energy wavesrepresent an example of destructive interference.It doesn’t take a relationship expert or a quantum physicist to know where I’mgoing with this. Given the nature of quantum physics, the definition of love—thedefinition of Happily Ever After—is constructive interference, otherwise knownas good vibes. Good vibes are nature’s way of telling you that you’re in theright place or with the right person. Just being in the same room with a partnerwho is in harmony with you lifts your energy; together you create ripples thatproduce high-energy waves.On the other hand, destructive interference, otherwise known as bad vibes, isnature’s way of alerting you to potential compromising threats. Bad vibes in arelationship may be your nervous system’s warning that you’re hanging out withthe wrong person. An energetically disharmonious relationship likely featuresshouting matches and recriminations—even being in the same room with yourpartner depresses you.So when you “entangle” (quantum physics terminology) with someone else’s energy,you want the interference to be constructive (good vibes) not destructive (badvibes). You want the interaction to increase your energy, not deplete it. Nowthat you understand the science behind a phenomenon that you’ve no doubt alreadynoticed—that some people energize you and some people exhaust you—I hope you’llmake it a practice to surround yourself with people who enhance your energy.Incidentally, as the Chinese figured out long before quantum physicistsdiscovered the influence of the nonmaterial nature of the Universe, you cansurround yourself with “physical” objects that enhance your energy as well.Physical objects vibrate just as you do. Feng shui, which originated in Chineseastronomy, balances the physical objects around you in a way that conforms toyour energy, thus enhancing qi (energy). To the Western mind, this may seem anodd concept, but you’ve no doubt already understood its impact without realizingit.Think about going to a department store for a sale, say a shoe sale atNordstrom. You find five pairs of shoes you like. They’re all the same price andfrom the same manufacturer, but in different styles. How do you settle on onepair? How do you make your final decision? The answer is that the shoes youactually buy make you feel good. They energize you more than the other shoes.You come home with the pair you love, not the other shoes you like.Another example is when you visit someone’s house and think, Wow, it’s sobeautiful—it feels so peaceful. I love this house. That’s a house that resonateswell with the energy of its occupants and with your energy as well. Or you visitsomeone else’s house and think, What’s up with that flocked wallpaper? Oh myGod, how could they have put that picture on the wall? That house doesn’t matchyour energy, and its occupants likely don’t either.If I suggest that you go home and read a book, I bet you’ll go home and curl upin your special chair, the one you feel most comfortable in, even though theremay be an identical matching partner parked right next to it. It’s not thechair; it’s the chair’s location in the surrounding energy field that makes youfeel good! In the water ripple analogy, the preferred chair is located at thepoint of the convergence of the ripples, where they create the most powerfulconstructive interference.Or a final example: Have you ever driven your partner crazy by rearranging thefurniture or insisting that all the furniture be replaced? The urge to move orreplace your furniture is often an indication that you’ve changed and thefurniture’s energy field no longer conforms to your new energy field. Or maybeyou’ve really changed and you need to move out of the house and away from yourpartner as well because the house and your spouse are no longer creatingconstructive interference patterns in your life!The important point is that you shouldn’t let your rational mind discount whatyour inner voices are telling you … whether it’s to move your furniture, get ridof a painting that gives you the creeps, bring a new partner into your life, or,in my case, disengage from a neighbor who makes chills run up and down my spine.If you pay attention to good and bad vibes, you’ll enhance your energy, and whenyou enhance your energy you’ll enhance your life. If, on the other hand, youdiscount the importance of reading good and bad vibrations, you may walk intothe proverbial lion’s den or even wind up staying there, making the rest of yourlife miserable.For humans, that’s not enough. With our highly evolved big brains, humans can domore than read good and bad vibes—we can create good and bad vibes when webroadcast thoughts from our brains. For most people, this is a harder concept toaccept than spiritual connectedness, feng shui, and destructive/constructiveinterference. That’s because we’re used to the notion that our thoughts resideinside our heads—maddeningly so on sleepless nights haunted by obsessiveworrying.But in truth, our brains broadcast signals outside our heads into theenvironment and respond to signals from the environment as well. Modern medicineexploits this two-way signaling for diagnostic and treatment purposes. You’re nodoubt familiar with electroencephalography (EEG), in which sensors and wires areplaced on the scalp to read the electrical activity of the brain.Magnetoencephalography does the same thing, except that the probe used to readthe brain’s electromagnetic activity doesn’t even touch the head! This amazinglynoninvasive technology, which is used for cognitive research as well as fordiagnostic purposes such as locating tumors before surgery, works because thebrain generates energy fields outside the head.Another noninvasive medical technology, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),generates a magnetic field outside the head to induce electrical activity in atargeted part of the brain.2 [part0018.html#ch02_2] In a 2003 study, Australianresearchers found that when they used TMS to boost the neural activity of thearea of the brain active in autistic savants, they could improve the drawingskills of some of their research subjects.3 [part0018.html#ch02_3] In 2000, YaleUniversity researchers found that TMS reduced auditory hallucinations inschizophrenics.4 [part0018.html#ch02_4]The most common usage of TMS is to treat depression that has been resistant toother therapies. More than 30 published studies have found that TMS can helptreatment-resistant depression, which laid the foundation for the Food and DrugAdministration’s decision to approve the first TMS device for treatment ofdepression in 2008. In 2012 a study published in Depression and Anxiety in theWiley Online Library confirmed the efficacy of TMS for treatment of majordepressive disorder (MDD) in clinical settings. The report, which summarizeddata collected from 42 clinical TMS practice sites in the United States thattreated 307 patients with MDD, found a 58 percent positive response rate amongthe patients and a 37 percent remission rate.5 [part0018.html#ch02_5]It is clear from all of these technologies—electroencephalography,magnetoencephalography, and TMS—that the brain generates and responds to energy“fields” that can influence cell behavior and gene expression and alterperception, mood, and behavior. Additionally, the mind’s field is responsiblefor the release and dissemination of neuropeptides and other neurotransmittersthat control cell and gene activity. The influence of the mind’s field is mostevident in the placebo effect, wherein healing is produced by the mind’s beliefthat a drug or medical procedure will be effective, even though the drug mayonly be sugar or chalk or the procedure has no medical value at all.To truly understand the potential power of our thoughts and beliefs, let’s lookat another principle of quantum mechanics, “nonlocality,” which Einsteinmemorably called “spooky action at a distance.” It turns out that once a quantumparticle interacts (or in quantum language, “entangles”) with another particle,no matter how many miles apart they are (that is, nonlocal), their mechanicalstates remain coupled. If, for example, one particle’s rotational (tornadolike)spin is clockwise, its entangled twin’s rotational spin is the opposite,counterclockwise. Quantum particles also possess a directional polarity, whichpoints either up or down. When one particle’s polarity is pointed upward, thepolarity of its partner points downward. No matter how much distance separatesthem, when the polarity or the rotation of one particle’s spin changes, thepolarity or rotation of its twin changes simultaneously as well, even if one isin Paris and the other is in Beijing.Physicists have come up with a variety of ingenious stories to help laypeople aswell as scientists understand nonlocality, an extremely weird concept foreveryone mired in the material world. University of Michigan physicist LumingDuan came up with a quantum casino in which roulette wheels are entangled—if oneball drops down on a black number, the ball at the next table must drop on red.6[part0018.html#ch02_6]While physicists established that quantum particles influence each othernonlocally and came up with stories attempting to explain it, parapsychologyresearchers started looking at whether human minds, like quantum particles,“entangle” nonlocally. Yes, they do! This phenomenon is supported anecdotally bypsychics, energy healers, parents, and couples in love who have sensed correctlythat something was wrong with an individual, a child, or a partner even thoughthat person was in another city or country.Theoretical physicist Amit Goswami says that University of Mexico research ledhim to the “inescapable” conclusion that human minds connect nonlocally:“Quantum nonlocality happens also between brains.”7 [part0018.html#ch02_7]In the University of Mexico experiments, two people meditated next to each otherinside an electronically shielded Faraday chamber for 20 minutes with theintention of experiencing a shared meditative state. Then the meditators wereplaced in two separate chambers, three meters apart in one experiment and 14.5meters apart in the next experiment, and hooked up to EEG machines. A red lightwas periodically flashed in the eyes of one meditator, which induced a uniquebrain-wave pattern called an “evoked potential.” In one out of four cases, theother meditator’s brain became “entangled”—it simultaneously elicited anevoked-potential brain-wave pattern, even though he/she did not see the light orhave any idea the light was being flashed.8 [part0018.html#ch02_8]Vibrational entanglement is a fundamental component of the “Law of Attraction”and the less talked about, and more personally relevant, “Law of Repulsion,”which explain what you bring into your life and what you drive away. I like toillustrate how these laws work with another analogy using familiar objects, inthis case a tuning fork and four crystal goblets shown in Figure A on thefollowing page. Each of the four crystal goblets spins at a different frequency,labeled W, X, Y, and Z, because each goblet is made of a different combinationof atoms.Then, in Figure B, I’ll strike the tuning fork designed to vibrate at frequencyX. Just like the powerful voice of a trained vocalist, the energy vibrations ofthe tuning fork entangle and constructively interfere with goblet X’s atoms,amplifying their energy and causing them to vibrate faster and faster. So muchpower is created by the energized vibrating atoms that the goblet actuallyexplodes! That’s constructive interference of the kind you experienced on yourhoneymoon when you and your partner’s energies were entangling in the bestpossible way.By now you’re thinking, If only it were that easy, I’d go out and buy a tuningfork to shape my world! The good news is that you don’t have to buy one; youalready have one. The thoughts your brain broadcasts operate as asophisticated—actually way more sophisticated—tuning fork.image [../images/00010.jpeg]To represent the power of our tuning-fork brain, let’s affix images expressingdifferent emotional “energies” to each of the four goblets in the illustrationon the next page. Goblet W features a photo of an angry couple, face to face,screaming at each other. Goblet X’s photo shows an ecstatic honeymooning couplecelebrating a very romantic dinner. Goblet Y illustrates the vexing scenario ofHow in the world did I end up with this guy. Goblet Z’s image is of a combativecouple blaming each other before a divorce court judge.image [../images/00011.jpeg]Given the choices, it’s an easy decision to zero in on goblet X, so let’s impactgoblet X again, this time using not a visible tuning fork but the thoughtsbroadcast by your tuning-fork brain. Through constructive interference, yourthoughts will energize life experiences that are resonant with the imagescreated by your mind. Focus on goblet X’s photo and your emotional exuberance inthose days/weeks/months/years when you were in the full throes of Happily EverAfter. Forget about the guy who dumped you after you paid his way through lawschool. Forget about the woman who left you for the dot-com billionaire. Justbanish any experiences you’ve had with the scenes from goblets W, Y, and Z fromyour thoughts—you don’t want to create constructive interference with thoseimages because they’ll wind up on your doorstep! While the images represented bygoblets W, Y, and Z are not activated by your thoughts, the image in goblet Xis. When our thoughts resonate with that image, the harmonious scenario of anecstatic couple will manifest in our lives.These goblet analogies illustrate how important it is to shift your passionatelynegative, fearful, angry thoughts and emotions to passionately positive ones inorder to create the Honeymoon Effect in your life. Consider which of the gobletimages are most familiar to you and, if the answer is all but X, take a look atyour thoughts. You can create the life/goblet vision you want by making surethat the thoughts you broadcast reflect exactly what you want to bring into yourlife. If you’re always broadcasting anger about your previous relationships, thesame kind of destructive relationship is going to show up at your door again. Ifyou avoid such negative thoughts and images, those scenes will likely not comealive in your life.Human and animal predators instinctively understand this. Take the example ofthe lioness I opened this chapter with. Unlike human hunters, the lioness isn’tlooking for the trophy gazelle with the biggest horns to be mounted on the wallof her den! She is interested in eating. So she does a quick energetic scan ofthe options and picks the weakest gazelle to tangle with, the one she senseswill put up the least fight and so provide the fastest, easiest way to getdinner.When they’re not out in the woods hunting for sport, human predators do the samething. Muggers, for example, look for victims who are broadcasting fearful ordistracted energy (sometimes making a mistake and picking the “wrong” victim,who gives them the fight of their lives). It’s not the clothes they’rewearing—it’s the vibrations they’re resonating. For all his faults, my predatorneighbor was good at one thing: he was a good scam artist because he correctlysensed my weakness; he sensed that I wouldn’t definitively turn him away as Ishould have done. Had I not been broadcasting ambivalent vibrations, he wouldhave moved on to more promising prey.An interesting series of experiments by parapsychology researcher andanthropologist Marilyn Schlitz, director of the Institute of Noetic Sciences,and British parapsychology skeptic and psychologist Richard Wiseman suggeststhat the thoughts researchers broadcast play a role even in rigorous scientificexperiments. Wiseman and Schlitz collaborated on studies to determine whether aperson can detect that someone is staring at them even when they don’t see them.These experiments established that when Schlitz was the one doing the staring,there was a statistically significant effect; when Wiseman was the one doing thestaring, there was no effect.9 [part0018.html#ch02_1] Those who have read TheBiology of Belief won’t be surprised. The believer, Schlitz, started off withthe premise that the experiment would work and it did. Wiseman, the nonbeliever,started out with the premise that it wouldn’t work and of course, as that washis belief, it didn’t.Now at this point you might be thinking (negatively), Well then, no HoneymoonEffect for me because my beliefs are all negative because negative is all I’veexperienced. If you’re a persistent naysayer, here is some good news to stewover. Even if your relationships have been disasters and you’re still bitterabout them, just fake it for a while. When you shift your thinking to focus onthe love, support, and close emotional relationship depicted in goblet X (evenif it seems like a scene from a planet unknown to you or from a honeymoon thatyou experienced once for a week in the distant past), you can attract that kindof relationship into your life. You can attract that loving relationship even ifyou’ve never experienced one in the past. But if you continue to wallow in thekinds of images and experiences illustrated in the other goblets, they’re goingto continue to be the only ways you experience relationships.If this sounds like blaming the victim, it is not. If we have been unaware ofhow our thoughts and beliefs influence our world, then in truth, how can we be“blamed” or “guilty” for our past actions? There cannot be blame, guilt, orshame over past events for a fundamental and simple reason: these derogatorywords apply only when one knows how something works and yet, armed with thatknowledge, engages in behavior that is destructive of self or of other “selves.”Clearly, the purpose of presenting the new science is not to give you a reasonto wallow in guilt about the past you created. As you now know, wallowing willjust attract more guilt into your life anyway! The purpose of presenting thisinformation is to help you realize how powerful you really are. Knowledge ispower, and with this knowledge you are empowered to create the life and therelationships of your choosing from now on. From now on you can embrace andrevel in the pulsating energetic Universe that Johns Hopkins Universityphysicist Richard Conn Henry posits: “The Universe is immaterial—mental andspiritual. Live, and enjoy.”10 [part0018.html#ch02_10]Live and enjoy the fact that you are a creator, not a victim of your life. Youcan have the kinds of relationships you want by using your brain as a tuningfork that resonates with what you want to create and avoids thinking about whatyou don’t want to bring into your life. You are manifesting your life. You havethe freedom to create what you want to create.Before I move on to the next chapter, about the biochemistry of love, I’d liketo address a good-vibes question that I suspect you may have already thought of.Aren’t good vibes about sex, not Happily Ever After love? Though that may betrue for organisms lower on the evolutionary ladder, it is not true for humans.I would be the last person to say sex is bad. Sex is good, even great, and notjust for the survival of the species. However, for Happily Ever After the goalis not sex for its own sake. The goal is sex with the person you want to have areal partnership with. As the most evolved animals on the evolutionary ladder,we can do more than just respond to genes and hormones. When you move from bedto bed, from sex to abandonment (I went through that phase), sex becomes like agymnastic session filled with lots of jumping jacks—and most of us feel there issomething missing.Some argue that because we are closely related to animals lower on theevolutionary ladder, we are not well suited for Happily-Ever-After, monogamousrelationships. That’s because in the 1990s, when DNA fingerprinting becamecommon, biologists learned that socially monogamous pairs are not necessarilysexually monogamous. Just like DNA testing that nails absent fathers inchild-support cases, research showed that there were lots of missing dads: “Thesituation has reached the point where failure to find extra-pair copulations inostensibly monogamous species—that is, cases in which monogamous species reallyturn out to be monogamous—is itself reportable …” write David P. Barash andJudith Eve Lipton in The Myth of Monogamy.11 [part0018.html#ch02_11]Consider this Romeo and Juliet–like gazelle story that appeared in an 1847Scientific American:A curious instance of affection in the animal, which ended fatally, took placelast week at the country residence of Baron Gauci, at Malta. A female gazellehaving suddenly died from something it had eaten, the male stood over the deadbody of his mate, butting everyone who attempted to touch it, then, suddenly,making a spring, struck his head against a wall, and fell dead at the side ofhis companion.In 2011, Scientific American reconsidered the 1847 version in a blog item. Aslovely as the story is, wrote the second author, it is far more likely that themale gazelle died from the same poison Baron Gauci’s female gazelle ingested orfrom an ill-positioned leap into the wall to avoid what he perceived as a humanpredator who came too close.12 [part0018.html#ch02_12] The cold, clinical truthis that a male gazelle is not a very likely candidate to sacrifice himself forthe love of his life. During mating season, male gazelles mark their territoryand mate with any mature female who strays into it, though they do draw the lineat venturing into a rival gazelle’s territory to mate.But no matter how many animals bite the monogamy dust (current holdouts includethe black vulture, the red-cockaded woodpecker, and the California mouse), Ithink the big evolutionary leap that our brains enabled sets us apart.I do grant that at times humans act as if they’re nowhere near the top of theevolutionary ladder. I only have to look at incidents in my own life when Iacted with less sense than a gazelle. I was in the Caribbean and in mydesperately-looking-for-someone phase when I invited a couple, who turned out tobe a prototypically dysfunctional pair, to stay at my house on Grenada. Had Itaken photos, this couple could have illustrated goblets W, Y, and Z. They werealways fighting and screaming, and the yelling alone should have been a tipoffto avoid this particular entanglement. Nevertheless, after theirrelationship-terminating final and most bitter argument, the woman asked me if Iwanted to have sex with her. I ignored all my antennae, rationalized by saying Iwasn’t breaking up a happy couple, and responded, “Why not?”I’ll tell you why not! I became entangled with this woman’s energy in a textbookcase of destructive interference. When the woman’s former partner left theisland, I was the only one left to argue with. I couldn’t have been more wrongfor her—I’m a nonabusive, non-confrontational guy. I was driving her mad becauseshe didn’t want a better relationship; she wanted a relationship that involvedlots of fighting.As for me, I was drowning in regret. My fear of confrontation limited myoptions, and I couldn’t imagine how to get rid of her. I was living in themiddle of the ocean on a little island. Where could she go? The tiny island ofGrenada kept getting smaller and smaller, and I became a prisoner in my ownhouse. Maybe Paul Simon wrote “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover” because he lives inmetropolitan New York, where it’s a lot easier to extricate yourself. In mycase, his 50 ways weren’t enough. I came up with a 51st way, which was to buy usboth tickets to New York—only mine was round trip.The moral of that story is this: “Be conscious of what you lust for!” Iunconsciously chose to be driven solely by hormones, and I could have chosendifferently. If human beings are just biological machines, lust is going to pullyou around (as it did me for a while). When you add consciousness, you becomethe driver of the machine. You are no longer predictable. Even astrologersrecognize that when individuals become conscious, astrology isn’t as accuratebecause people become far less predictable. Instead of automatically reacting tothe energetic field around us that includes the tides and the pull of planets,we can modify our own vibrations and our responses to the vibrations of others.So it’s time to stop saying I “always” find a guy who’s afraid of a commitmentor I “always” find a woman who dumps me. We create our lives with our beliefs,and we broadcast those beliefs into the energetic environment around us. We arecreating our relationships, and with that knowledge, we have the freedom tocreate whatever kinds of relationships we want!If that’s so, you might be wondering why my positive thinking about my predatorneighbor didn’t work. At the time, I was making my first forays into using mybrain as a tuning fork, but I still had a lot to learn. Creating therelationship you want is complicated. I didn’t yet fully understand the power ofthe subconscious to subvert even the best of intentions.I now know a lot more about how to attract what I want into my life than I didthen. I know a lot more about not discounting bad vibes, and I have at long lastcreated a Happily-Ever-After relationship in my life. So despite headlines aboutspectacularly dysfunctional celebrity marriages, despite plenty of examples ofhumans allowing their hormones and genes to drive their behavior, it is possibleto create a higher level of love. When you acknowledge the power of good vibesand switch your thoughts to goblet X–like images, you will be well on your wayto creating Happily Ever After in your life."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]CHAPTER 3 [part0006.html#vk4]Love Potions [part0006.html#vk4]Take then this pitcher and remember well my words. Hide it so that no eye shallsee nor no lip go near it: but when the wedding night has come and that momentin which the wedded are left alone, pour this essenced wine into a cup and offerit to King Mark and to Iseult his queen. Oh! Take all care, my child, that theyalone shall taste this brew. For this is its power: they who drink of ittogether love each other with their every single sense and with their everythought, forever, in life and in death.— THE ROMANCE OF TRISTAN AND ISEULTBY M. JOSEPH BÉDIERThe “essenced wine” spiked with flowers and herbs did its job all too well, aseveryone familiar with the tragic, adulterous love story of Irish princessIseult (also known as Isolde) and Tristan, the Cornish knight who unwittinglydrank the brew intended for his uncle King Mark, knows.Popularized by French medieval poetry, the story of Tristan and Iseult’sill-fated love sparked by an aphrodisiacal brew is just one example of thereputed power of love potions throughout history. Medieval theologian andoccultist Albertus Magnus wrote about a concotion of the brains of a partridgecalcined into a powder and swallowed in red wine; Galen, the second-centurycourt physician to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, recommended a glass of thickhoney, taken before bedtime, with almonds and one hundred grains of the pinetree; Henry VI favored Amagnac brandy from southwest France; Cleopatra swore bya drink of dissolved pearls in vinegar; and The Perfumed Garden, a manual ofArabian erotic technique written in the 16th century by Sheik al-Nefwazi touteda recipe for green peas boiled with onions and powered with cinnamon, ginger,and cardamom seeds, well pounded. Another Arab recipe features the Indian rootgalanga mixed with cubebs (berries similar to grains of pepper that areindigenous to Java), sparrow wort, cardamoms, nutmeg, gillyflowers, Indianthistle, laurel seeds, cloves, and Persian pepper taken twice daily morning andnight in pigeon or fowl broth preceded and followed by water. Least appetizingof all is a recipe cited by the Roman poet Propertius that includes snake bones,a toad, and the feathers of a screech owl.From the point of view of biochemistry, love is also about potions, but with alldue respect to the legend of Tristan and Iseult and the elaborate love potionscreated throughout human history, the potions I’m talking about are infinitelymore sophisticated, finely calibrated neurochemical and hormone cocktails thatcourse through your body when you fall in and out of love.Yes, what I’m saying is that on one level the Honeymoon Effect is a chemicaladdiction, which is why things can turn so miserable so quickly when it ends.Watch out if the object of your desire calls it off while you’re still baskingin your biochemically induced love “high.” You might wind up like me, as Idescribed in the introduction, in withdrawal, sitting in a chair in an emptyhouse mooning over your lost love.In this chapter, I’ll talk about the chemicals and hormones that help explainthe anxiety, loss of appetite, and euphoria that characterize human love. Thesechemical love potions spur us on to seek out sexual partners, fixate on aspecial partner, and bond with that partner long enough to raise the mosthelpless newborns in the animal kingdom, at least past infancy. Of course itdoesn’t always work out that way, because this is about humans in love, notabout scientific equations—as Shakespeare’s fairy Puck famously exclaimed abouthumans in love: “Lord, what fools these mortals be!”Before I get into the biochemistry of love, I want to stress that despite Puck’slow opinion of foolish mortals in love, we do not have to be slaves to ourneurochemicals and hormones! We are “self-biologists” who create with thethoughts in our minds the love potions that control the cells and tissues in ourbodies. Yes, this is the work of the infamous mind-body connection that untilrecently has been denied, ignored, or downplayed by conventional science.Simplifying the Mind-Body ConnectionIn 1967, I began my first experiments with cloning stem cells. Using amicroscope, I scanned cells in a culture dish of mixed cell types, seeking stemcells distinguished by their unique spindle shape. Then I placed a small glassring around the selected cell, which allowed me to separate it from all theother cells in the dish. Finally, I used enzymes to release the cell from thedish so I could transfer a single stem cell into its own culture dish.Cells resemble fish in that they live in a water environment; consequently, atissue culture dish is like a miniature aquarium. Tissue culture medium, achemically balanced solution that supports growth and viability, provides thecell’s environment. Our stem cell culture medium contained a very potentcocktail of salts and nutrients that allowed stem cells to grow and replicate.The single stem cell I added to the culture dish divided about every ten hoursin this medium. First there was one cell, then two, then four cells; after aweek there were more than 50,000 cells in the dish. Since all of the cells werederived from the same parent cell, all of the cells were genetically identical.Now here is where the experiment becomes mind-blowing. I split the cellpopulation and placed them into three different culture dishes as illustrated onthe next page. Each of the three dishes had a distinct “environment,” a culturemedium consisting of different biochemicals. In one dish the cells formedmuscle, in the second dish the cells formed bone, and in the third dish thecells formed fat.1a,b [part0018.html#ch03_1]image [../images/00012.jpeg]The profound question this experiment answered was this: “What controls the fateof the cells?” Remember, all cells were genetically identical at the start sogenes did not control the cells’ varying fates! Yes, it was the environment, theculture medium that controlled the expression of the cells. The fate and healthof cells are a complement to their environment, a principle I described in TheBiology of Belief (with a nod to James Carville’s advice in Bill Clinton’spresidential campaign) as “It’s the environment, stupid.”My mentor Irv Konigsberg, one of the first cell biologists to master the art ofcloning stem cells, had pointed me in this direction right at the beginning ofmy career. When I first started cloning cells, he told me that when the culturedcells you’re studying are ailing, you look first to the cell’s environment, notthe cell itself, for the cause: a healthy environment leads to healthy cells; asick environment leads to sick cells. All of my experiments confirming that“It’s the environment, stupid” presaged the now booming field of epigenetics(“above”-genetics), which in study after study is documenting how theenvironment controls the activity of genes. Finally mainstream science hasrecognized that genes do not determine the fate of cells.How do these studies relate to you? When you see yourself in the mirror, you seea single human organism—you—looking back. However, as I mentioned in Chapter 1[part0009.html], this is a misperception. We are not single organisms; we aremade up of about 50 trillion cells! By strict definition, a human being is acommunity of living organisms, our cells. More specifically, a human is a“skin-covered” culture dish containing 50 trillion cells. Our blood is thegrowth medium, the cell-controlling environment within our skin-covered culturedish.In fact, it makes no difference to the fate of a cell if it is in a plastic- ora skin-covered culture dish. Wherever it lives, its life is controlled by theculture medium. As a cell biologist, I was responsible for controlling thechemistry of my cells in plastic culture dishes. As a “self-biologist”illustrated in the cartoon on the next page, you control the chemistry of yourown culture medium, the blood, through your nutrition and the operation of yourbrain. When your mind perceives the experience of love, it causes the brain tosecrete neurochemicals such as dopamine, oxytocin, and growth hormone into theblood (more on this later). When these chemicals are added to the culture mediumof cells grown in a plastic dish, the cells react by exhibiting robust, healthygrowth. The same occurs for cells in the body’s skin-covered dish—yes, you aregenerally healthier and more alive when you’re in love.image [../images/00013.jpeg]“Self-Biologist”: While the world’s population boasts a few cell biologists, thefact is we are all “self-biologists.” This cartoon emphasizes that the braincontrols the chemistry of the body’s culture medium, the blood, which in turnnourishes and regulates the genetics and behaviors of the body’s cells. Thechemistry released by the brain into the blood complements the perceptions andbeliefs we hold in our minds. When we change the way we respond to the world, wechange the chemical composition of our blood, which in turn regulates ourgenetics and behavior. This is the foundation of the placebo effect.(Illustration by Bob Mueller)However, if the same brain in the same body perceives a threatening world, itdoes not prompt the brain to release the biochemicals of love. Instead, fearprovokes the release of stress hormones and inflammatory agents such ascytokines into the blood. If these chemicals are added to cell cultures in aplastic dish, they cause the cells to stop growing and may cause them to die.The chemistry of stress stunts the growth and maintenance of cells because itdiverts the body’s energy to support protection mechanisms. This is why stressis the primary cause of illness and is responsible for up to 90 percent of alldoctor visits.2 [part0018.html#ch03_2]It is important to note that stress hormones have multiple roles and theiractions are predicated on the type of “stress” an individual is experiencing.There are two types of stress, each with different biochemical consequences:distress and eustress. Distress occurs when we perceive that our survival isthreatened. That’s when stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline cause us toshift from growth to protection, saving our lives if there is an acute threat(like a mountain lion) or becoming corrosive if the threat is chronic (likeeveryday traffic and a job you hate).Eustress, on the other hand, which literally means “good stress,” results whenwe “stress” the system with nonthreatening behaviors such as engaging inphysical activities like sports and mental activities like writing this book,and falling passionately in love! Researchers have found that the stress hormonecortisol is released not just when we’re fleeing an avalanche but also whenwe’re blissfully in love. In 2004, University of Pisa researchers found that thelevels of cortisol were “significantly higher” among their research subjects whohad recently fallen in love than those who were not in love.3[part0018.html#ch03_3] In 2009, University of Texas researchers found thatcortisol levels increased when women in their study were asked to reflect ontheir romantic partners. The increase was “particularly pronounced andrelatively long-lasting” in subjects who spent the most time thinking abouttheir relationships.4 [part0018.html#ch03_4]image [../images/00014.jpeg]The ABCs of mind-body biology: All living organisms read and respond toenvironmental information. A: In the process of perception, our brains readenvironmental signals (sights, sounds, smells, temperature, pain, etc.) that areregistered by the nervous system’s receptors. B: Based upon our instincts andlife experiences, the mind assesses the incoming signals and makes aninterpretation, a value judgment of their meanings as they relate to oursurvival. C: The mind’s interpretation of the incoming signals induces the brainto release neurochemicals that provoke the body to engage in a positive growthresponse or a life-sustaining protection behavior, or to ignore the signalsbecause they are not relevant to our survival. The neurochemicals released intothe blood regulate cell behavior and, via epigenetics, control gene activity.Whether you’re in love or running from danger, your mind calibrates your blood’sbiochemistry, which in turn controls your biology and genetics. The mindinterprets your perceptions of the world, and your brain goes to work to producethe biochemistry that complements your perceptions. Here’s an example. I lovejalapeño peppers; hot, spicy food activates my taste buds in a pleasurable way.But other people see me downing intensely hot food and their reaction is “Howcan you eat that?” Both of us have the same perception—that the food isspicy—but our minds interpret those same perceptions differently. Mybiochemistry revels in jalapeño peppers; yours may reject them.To better understand the biochemistry of love, think of your brain not as atuning fork resonating in the Universe’s vast energy field, as we did in thechapter on quantum physics. In this context, think of the brain more prosaicallyas a good old Newtonian machine, actually a paint machine (brains are amazinglyversatile—one image isn’t enough).When I say a paint machine, I’m not talking about a robot that flawlessly paintsan entire room, including the trim. Would that I had one of those mythicalmachines! I’m talking about a paint color mixer machine that ensures you getexactly the hue you want. In these machines, an array of tints is stored incylinders. The tints are squirted in precise ratios into a can of white paint toproduce the exact shade requested. There is no single red, green, or blue paint.Instead, there are hundreds of variations of each color just as there are in therainbow spectrum of paint chips that customers use to select their desired wallcolor.In our analogy, the brain resembles the paint mixing machine. Rather thanblending different color tints, the brain is a love potion mixing machinestocked with an array of neurochemicals and hormones that researchers havelinked to the biochemistry of love. In the throes of first passion, your braincan order up “passion red” by squirting lots of drops of testosterone into themix. That went well, so your brain orders up “lovesick pink” with lots ofdopamine that motivates the pursuit of more pleasure with the object of yourdesire. When you’re convinced you’ve found the One your brain orders uplove-of-my-life lavender, a mix heavy on the bonding boosters vasopressin andoxytocin and shockingly low on serotonin, which means you’re getting more andmore fixated on and obsessed with your True Love. When you defy thedivorce/miserable relationship odds and shift into Happily Ever After, the brainmixes up still-crazy-in-love blue with a huge squirt of the cuddle chemicaloxytocin.You get the picture. Our brains have at their disposal a number of ingredients,neurochemical “tints,” that can be mixed in varying ratios to produce specific“potions” that compel us first to mate and then to partner with our mates,thereby giving helpless human babies a better chance for survival. Scientistsstill have a lot to learn about the makeup of these powerful love potions, buthere are a few ingredients that have been studied.Estrogen and Testosterone: MatingWhen birds and bees “do it,” it is not about falling in love. It is aboutmating. Take starfish. Female starfish squirt their eggs into the water; malessquirt their sperm into the same water. Eventually the twain meet to createanother generation of starfish. Not much entanglement there!Lust-driven human mating requires more entanglement, though long-termpartnership doesn’t. When it’s about lust only, the sex hormones testosterone,notorious for fueling alpha males more interested in sex than bonding, andestrogen, best known for fueling female fertility, play big roles.5[part0018.html#ch03_5]Though testosterone is mostly associated with men and estrogen is mostlyassociated with women, these hormones play reproductive roles in both sexes.Human males produce on average ten times as much testosterone as females andindeed, men with very high levels of testosterone are not ideal partnershipmaterial; they tend to divorce more often, abuse their spouses more frequently,and have more affairs than men with less stratospheric levels.6[part0018.html#ch03_6] But testosterone fuels sexual desire in both sexes.7[part0018.html#ch03_7]Estrogen soars when females are fertile, and males produce on average only afraction of the estrogen females produce. But researchers have learned thatestrogen plays a role in male sexuality, as well by enabling the maturation ofsperm.8 [part0018.html#ch03_8]My favorite example of the complicated roles estrogen and testosterone play inmales and females comes from the bird kingdom: the zebra finch. At one point inits embryonic development, the male zebra finch produces estrogen, which istransformed into a testosteronelike hormone in the brain, which in turn enablesmale birds to sing. Male zebra finches begin to sing at puberty, and researcherssuspect that just like human females who swoon when their old-fashioned suitorssing outside their balconies, female zebra finches gravitate to their suitors’singing.9 [part0018.html#ch03_9]The roles estrogen and testosterone play in the male and female reproductivesystems are undoubtedly more complex than once thought, but there is no doubtthat both help propel us to take the first steps to ensure the survival of ourspecies.Dopamine: Pleasure and CravingTestosterone and estrogen may get us to the sex scene, but there’s no way wehumans would engage in sex with enough frequency and gusto to propagate ourspecies if it weren’t pleasurable. Enter the neurotransmitter dopamine, thecrucial chemical that fuels the drive to repeat pleasurable experiences. Whenyour dopamine levels are up, you are jazzed: you’re not hiding under yourblankets alone at home; you’re motivated to get out and experience pleasure.10[part0018.html#ch03_10]Unsurprisingly, because of its role in driving reproduction, dopamine is anancient evolutionary molecule. In fact, the role of dopamine in evolutionarilysimple organisms, such as microscopic roundworms, is almost identical to itsrole in humans. That’s why University of Texas researchers are able to usegenetically modified, dopamine-deficient worms to identify drugs that may helptreat Parkinson’s disease, which is characterized by a loss ofdopamine-producing cells in the brain.11 [part0018.html#ch03_11]Dopamine is synthesized deep in the brain’s ventral tegmental area and releasedin the nucleus accumbens in the forebrain. These are key areas in thepleasure/reward circuit of our brains, and, as anyone who has struggled withaddiction can tell you, this circuit has a dark side. Activated by every varietyof pleasurable, potentially addictive substance or activity known tohumans—including cocaine, heroin, sex, gambling, shopping, and high-caloriefood—too much stimulation can lead to desperate cravings and the risky,compulsive behavior of an addict.12 [part0018.html#ch03_12]image [../images/00015.jpeg]Deep within the center of our brain, specific control centers engage growth andprotection behaviors in response to pleasure and pain stimuli. The primarycenters include 1: the nucleus accumbens; 2: the ventral tegmentum; and 3: theventral pallidum.The sirenlike draw of dopamine has been demonstrated again and again in animals,starting in the 1950s. Rats with electrodes implanted in the part of the brainwhere dopamine is synthesized press a lever that stimulates theirpleasure/reward circuit incessantly—up to seven thousand times per hour. Ratschoose stimulation of the pleasure/reward circuit over food and water. Femalerats abandon their newborn pups in favor of pressing the lever, mirroring crackaddict moms who neglect their children in favor of the drug. The few studiesdone on humans found the same phenomenon—when given the chance, humans slavishlychoose to stimulate the dopamine-producing areas of the brain repeatedly,neglecting relationships and personal hygiene in favor of hits of dopamine.13[part0018.html#ch03_13]What does this have to do with the Honeymoon Effect? A number of recent studieshave found that it is the reward circuit of the brain that is activated whenyou’re madly in love. These are the very same areas that proved so addictive torats and a few humans in the laboratory that they ignored everything in favor ofjolts of pleasure provided by dopamine-producing areas of the brain.In 2000, Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki of University College London recruited17 madly-in-love students and scanned their brains when they looked at a photoof their beloved and when they looked at a photo of a friend. Thepleasure/reward, dopamine-rich circuit of their brains lit up when the studentsviewed a photo of their beloved and stayed dark when looking at a photo of afriend. Bartels and Zeki concluded, “It is perhaps surprising that so complexand overwhelming a sentiment [love] should correlate differentially withactivity in such restricted regions of the brain, and fascinating to reflectthat the face that launched a thousand ships should have done so through such alimited expanse of cortex.”14 [part0018.html#ch03_14]Scientists may have been surprised to learn that falling madly in love taps thesame brain circuitry as snorting cocaine. However, anyone who’s ever sat by thephone waiting for the call, quit a job to follow a lover, or slumped desolateand defeated in a chair with no motivation to leave it after being dumped wouldnot be surprised at all. For lovers who fall head over heels, love can feel likea roller coaster—there can be a fine line between love as “the best thing that’sever happened to me” and, while waiting impatiently and obsessively for the nextfix, “the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.”Unsurprisingly, given how common divorce and breakups are, researchers say thatfor most couples the intense roller coaster lasts only a year or two. But thatdoesn’t mean the Honeymoon Effect can’t last. When researchers scanned thebrains of 17 women and men who reported they were still intensely in love withtheir spouses after an average of 21 years of marriage, the dopamine-rich areasof their brains associated with reward and motivation lit up just as they do inwomen and men in the throes of new passion. The researchers wrote, “These datasuggest that the reward-value associated with a long-term partner may besustained, similar to new love.”But the study also found “many more brain regions” involved in long-term intenseromantic relationships than in newly-in-love relationships, including areas thatare linked to attachment and those that can modulate anxiety and pain. Thatsuggests that long-time romantic love offers a bonus: “Thus present findings arein line with behavioral observations suggesting that one key distinction betweenromantic love in its early and later stages is greater calm associated with thelatter,” concluded the researchers.15 [part0018.html#ch03_15] The pleasure ofdopamine combines with the calm that comes with long-term, solid attachment.Sounds like Happily Ever After to me!Vasopressin: Bonding and AggressionIn most species, females and males do not form what biologists call “paircouples,” let alone relationships powerful enough to launch the thousand shipsof the Trojan War. In 97 percent of mammals, for example, a male has sex with afemale in heat and then goes off to find another female to produce moreoffspring; the females raise their offspring on their own.To figure out what makes the 3 percent tick, researchers have extensivelystudied the prairie vole, a hamster-size rodent from the Midwest. Unlike theirpromiscuous, relatively asocial cousins, meadow voles, prairie voles formlifelong attachments with their mates, cooperate to rear their offspring, andaggressively protect their nests. When the opportunity presents itself, bothmale and female prairie voles may stray sexually, but most come back to thepartner they’ve bonded with for life. In fact, field research has found thatprairie vole couples beat humans when it comes to long-term pair bonding.Three-quarters of prairie vole couples endure until one dies and even then mostdo not take on a new mate.16 [part0018.html#ch03_16]Scientists have zeroed in on two closely related neuropeptides—vasopressin andoxytocin—that are synthesized in the hypothalamus and released in the pituitaryto help explain how prairie voles bond so closely. Researchers have foundreceptors for both molecules in the pleasure/reward regions of the male andfemale prairie vole, the same regions that light up in brain scans of humans inlove. Though vasopressin and oxytocin may play a role in cementing relationshipsin both males and females, the studies have focused on vasopressin in maleprairie voles and oxytocin (more later) in female prairie voles.17[part0018.html#ch03_17]Males produce a lot more vasopressin than females, which is why researchers havefocused their vasopressin studies on male prairie voles. In animals, vasopressininduces characteristic male behavior like scent-marking of territory andaggression. Hamsters, for example, start scent-marking their territory within aminute of being injected with vasopressin. When the prairie vole ejaculates, hisvasopressin levels soar, and he also turns into an attentive partner and parent.Further corroborating the link between bonding and vasopressin, when virgin maleprairie voles are injected with vasopressin, they start defending theirterritory and become instantly possessive of their mates. These studies revealthat vasopressin is linked not just to bonding but also to aggression.18[part0018.html#ch03_18]You might expect that the behavioral differences between faithful male prairievoles and philandering male meadow voles could be explained by their differinglevels of vasopressin (and the more the better), but that is not the case. Thekey difference between the two voles is the location of their vasopressinreceptors. Unlike the meadow vole, the monogamous prairie vole’s vasopressinreceptors are centered in one of the brain’s principal pleasure/reward regions,the ventral pallidum, next to the dopamine-rich nucleus accumbens. These regionsare linked to addiction.19 [part0018.html#ch03_19] Researchers have also foundthe same phenomenon in primates; monogamous marmosets have higher levels ofvasopressin bound in the reward centers of their brains than do nonmonogamousrhesus macaques.20 [part0018.html#ch03_20]Capitalizing on this discovery, researchers at Emory University have turnedpromiscuous meadow voles into mate- and offspring-loving dads by creating mutantmeadow voles with vasopressin receptors in their reward center.21[part0018.html#ch03_21] And researchers have turned laboratory prairie volesinto nonbonding cads by blocking their vasopressin receptors in the lateralseptum area of the brain.22 [part0018.html#ch03_22]Perhaps to the dismay of women with philandering partners, human behavior is toocomplicated to similarly engineer. Because it’s so much harder to study humans,it’s too soon to say that human males mimic prairie vole males. But vasopressinis released when humans as well as prairie voles have sex, which provides moreevidence that the reward centers of the brain are involved with bonding and lovein humans as they are in prairie voles. Scientists are becoming more and moreconvinced that we can learn a lot from monogamous prairie voles and that atleast in males, vasopressin is a key ingredient in the love potions that fosterhuman bonding.Oxytocin: The Bonds of LoveIf biochemistry were simple, which it’s not, all you’d need is oxytocin, whosereputation for bonding is clear from some of its nicknames: love drug, cuddlechemical, and trust hormone.Oxytocin was once known only as the molecule that stimulates uterinecontractions during labor, milk production in breast-feeding, and the intensemother-offspring bond in mammals. When oxytocin is injected into the brains ofvirgin rats, it quickly induces maternal behavior—rat mothers will cross anelectrified grid to nurture pups. When oxytocin is blocked, mother rats rejecttheir pups.But researchers studying female prairie voles discovered that oxytocin promotesbonding with a male partner just as vasopressin promotes male bonding with afemale partner. Because their brains are packed with oxytocin receptors in thereward centers and oxytocin levels increase during mating, monogamous femaleprairie voles learn to associate the feeling of pleasure with their mate (justas humans do). When oxytocin is blocked, famously monogamous female prairievoles do not bond with their mates.23 [part0018.html#ch03_23]While animal studies laid the groundwork for understanding the importance ofoxytocin in couple bonding, it was studies of human couples that turned themolecule into a superstar outside scientific circles.In one study, Swiss researchers gave 47 couples a nasal spray containing eitheroxytocin or a placebo. The couples then participated in a videotaped “conflict”discussion. Those who received oxytocin exhibited more positive and lessnegative behavior and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.24[part0018.html#ch03_24] Other studies suggest that oxytocin promotes trust. Inone experiment, research subjects were given a sum of money to invest with atrustee. Half the participants used an oxytocin nose spray before the experimentand the other half a placebo spray. Subjects who received oxytocin were nearlytwice as likely to turn all their money over to a trustee.25[part0018.html#ch03_25] And a National Institute of Mental Health study foundthat subjects who inhaled oxytocin before looking at pictures of threateningfaces had markedly lower activity in their brains’ fear centers.26[part0018.html#ch03_26]Unsurprisingly, given its reputation, vendors selling oxytocin nasal spray andsublingual drops have proliferated on the Internet (one product is called“Liquid Trust”). These oxytocin products are marketed to a wide-ranging group ofpotential consumers, including singles looking for relationships, feudingcouples hoping to save their relationships, and salespeople who want people toinstantly trust them. But savvy couples cultivating relationships with highlevels of trust and comfortable bonding know that, like prairie voles, they canboost oxytocin more pleasurably on their own and without spending a dime throughkissing, touching, cuddling, and sex.Serotonin: ObsessionIn 1999, University of Pisa psychiatrist Donatella Marazziti and her colleagues(the same group of researchers that found elevated cortisol levels in subjectsmadly in love) decided to test the idea that the early stages of romantic loveare akin to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This was an educated guess,given the number of hours people in love report thinking about their partners(“all the time” is not an uncommon estimate) and the number of plaintive lovesongs with a can’t-get-her/him-out-of-my-mind theme.Marazziti and her colleagues recruited 20 subjects who had fallen in love in theprevious six months and spent at least four hours a day thinking about theirbeloved. They also recruited 20 unmedicated OCD patients and 20 control subjectsneither in love nor suffering from OCD. When the researchers tested theirsubjects’ blood, they found that the group suffering from OCD and those in lovehad similarly low levels of 5-HT, a protein that transports serotonin betweenbrain cells.But the researchers also found that the similarities between those in love andthose who suffer from pathological OCD were short lived. When the researcherstested the blood of a few of their in-love subjects 12 to 18 months after theyfirst started their relationships, their 5-HT levels had returned to the normallevels of the control group. The results of the experiment, concluded the Pisaresearchers, “suggest that being in love literally induces a state which is notnormal as indeed suggested by a variety of colloquial expressions usedthroughout the ages in different countries, all of which refer generally tofalling ‘insanely’ in love or to being ‘lovesick.’”27 [part0018.html#ch03_27]In addition to lovesickness and OCD, low levels of serotonin in the brain havebeen linked to everything from depression to seasonal affective disorder toimpulsive violence to rage. In fact, low serotonin levels coupled with surginglevels of dopamine and the stress hormone cortisol may help explain the ragesome lovers experience after they’re dumped.In her book Why We Love, anthropologist Helen Fisher explains the neurologicalbasis for what forensic psychologist J. Reid Meloy calls abandonment rage: “…the basic brain network for rage is closely connected to centers in theprefrontal cortex that process reward-assessment and reward expectation. Andwhen people and other animals begin to realize that an expected reward is injeopardy, even unattainable, these centers in the prefrontal cortex signal theamygdala and trigger rage … For example, when a cat’s brain circuits for rewardare artificially stimulated, they feel intense pleasure. If this stimulation iswithdrawn, however, they bite. And each time the pleasure is withdrawn, the catgets angrier.”Similarly, “hell hath no fury” like a woman or man scorned. Fisher tells thestory of one of the subjects of her studies, Barbara. Barbara’s brain had firstbeen scanned for a study about people madly in love. At that time, she wasglowing with health, optimism, and love for her partner, Michael. Five monthslater, when she had her brain scanned for a second time after Michael hadrejected her, her colorless face was streaked with tears, she had lost weight,and she sadly described her misery: “I have a lump of unhappiness in my chest.”Barbara’s unhappiness turned to fury after she viewed a photo of Michael duringher brain scan. She lashed out in anger at Fisher: “Why do you want to studythis?”28 [part0018.html#ch03_28]At the most extreme, some spurned lovers resort to stalking and violence—evenmurder. Most people, however, wallow in misery for a while and then slowly startto heal, especially if they meet another partner relatively quickly.You might think one way of mitigating abandonment rage is to self-medicate—say,up your levels of serotonin. But as is the case with every love potioningredient, it’s not so simple and more isn’t necessarily better. Thesechemicals work synergistically and can operate differently depending on whichpart of the brain and which part of the body are involved; also, picking one toelevate can backfire. For example, there are a number of well-documented sideeffects (including low libido) of widely prescribed antidepressants such asProzac or Paxil, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which aim toincrease serotonin levels.Even the cuddle chemical oxytocin, which has potential as a treatment for autismand unassailable bonding credentials, also has a dark side according to recentresearch. Belgian researchers have found that oxytocin does not unconditionallypromote trust—it makes people more cooperative when playing a social game ifthey’ve met their partners before the game, but makes them less cooperative whenthey play with an anonymous partner they know nothing about.29[part0018.html#ch03_29] Dutch researchers have also found that their subjectsbecome more ethnocentric under the influence of oxytocin. When asked to resolvea moral dilemma, such as choosing to save five lives from a runaway train bysacrificing one life, oxytocin-sniffing Dutch men more often saved fellowcountrymen over Arabs and Germans than did the control group.30[part0018.html#ch03_30] “It now seems clear that there’s no free endocrinelunch. Even if oxytocin is just the thing to bring peace in our time to therodents of the world, there’s no single hormonal switch that can make us betterhumans,” Robert M. Sapolsky, professor of neuroscience at Stanford University,wrote in an op-ed piece called “Peace, Love and Oxytocin” in the Los AngelesTimes.31 [part0018.html#ch03_31]A better strategy than trying to find a magic potion to enhance your life is tofocus on your mind because your biochemistry matches your perceptions. Before Imove on from love potions to the next chapter, which deals with the mind, thisis a good time to point out that the cascade of chemicals that drive love can beunleashed not just by falling in love with a person but also by falling in lovewith a project or idea. Artists painting in a frenzy, entrepreneurs starting abusiness, a cell biologist writing about the Honeymoon Effect, a teenager inlove—wherever there is passion, not far behind are the potent chemical brewsthat motivate us to pursue the objects of our desire."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]CHAPTER 4 [part0006.html#vk5]Four Minds Don’tThink Alike [part0006.html#vk5]The magic of first love is our ignorance that it can ever end.—BENJAMIN DISRAELIYou had the good vibes going. You were high from the love potions coursingthrough your body. You were humming all the crazy-in-love songs you’ve everheard, and for once they made total sense. You had created the Honeymoon Effectwith the love of your life, and you knew that this time it was going to lastforever.Except it didn’t.It all came crashing down, and you were left devastated and obsessed with whatmight have been. And puzzled: how could something so magical degenerate intoendless, bickering recriminations and, if you were married, divorce court?After all, you wanted it to work. You believed it would work. Maybe The Biologyof Belief works for other people, you’re thinking, but it doesn’t for you. Yes,it does! But there’s a catch, which explains why positive thinking andbelieving, by themselves, don’t work.The catch is that when you bonded so closely with your partner during thosefirst blissful days and months, your behaviors and actions were controlled bythe processing of your conscious minds. The conscious mind is the “creative”mind, the one that acts on behalf of your wishes and desires. So when theconscious minds of two lovers entangle, together they create magical harmony.Because honeymoon partners are operating from their deepest wishes and desires,the outcome of their interactions is … voilà, Heaven on Earth!However, over time, your conscious mind becomes burdened with thoughts dealingwith the busyness of everyday life—balancing your budget, scheduling yourchores, planning your weekend. The processing of the conscious mind shifts fromcreating the honeymoon experience to the management and strategies needed todeal with perceived necessities. The result is that the conscious mindrelinquishes behavioral control to default programs previously stored in thesubconscious mind.When it comes to partners, there are suddenly four instead of two mindsinvolved. And these two “extra” subconscious minds can wreak havoc onHappily-Ever-After relationships. When our conscious minds stop paying attentionto the moment, we lose control over our honeymoon creation because weunknowingly engage in preprogrammed behaviors we acquired through ourdevelopmental experiences. For many couples, once that subconscious programmingcomes to the fore, the honeymoon glow fades very quickly.That’s not surprising, because the behaviors programmed in the subconscious mindare primarily derived from observing and downloading other people’s behaviors(many of them negative and disempowering)—especially those of your parents,immediate family, community, and culture. You start seeing a side of yourpartner (and yourself) that never emerged during the honeymoon. When theconscious mind stops paying attention to the current moment, you automaticallyand, most important, unconsciously engage in behaviors you downloaded fromothers.Here’s a scenario that may be all too familiar to you.You’re basking in the Honeymoon Effect, full of love for your supportive partnerwho lights up your life. Then one day you ask him a simple, loving question.He’s not thinking about how good your relationship is. His conscious mind ispreoccupied with fixing the car or paying the rent, so he responds reflexivelyand nastily with a tone that says, “Leave me alone.” Shocked, you respond: “Whoare you?”You have just experienced the moment when honeymoons generally begin to fallapart. He responded so unconsciously that he didn’t even notice how nasty hewas. And, in his response to what he perceives as a personal “attack” on hischaracter, he starts digging in his heels to defend himself to the death. He’sthinking, She accused me of not being me. I’m the same me I’ve always been. Idon’t know what she’s talking about. What’s her problem?Meanwhile, you’re thinking, Where is the loving man I married? Your consciousmind detaches from the current moment to assess the unpleasant situation inwhich you now find yourself. Uh-oh, unbeknownst to you, you also unconsciouslydefault to your own formerly hidden subconscious behaviors that you acquiredfrom your family and culture. Now it’s your partner’s turn to be shocked as hisonce loving spouse shifts into criticism and blame, as well as other less thanloving programs you downloaded from your parents.As the daily issues of life increasingly occupy your and your partner’sconscious minds, more disharmonious unconscious behavior patterns begin to riseto the surface. Soon you both shift from appreciating your partner to focusingon his or her periodic nasty outbursts. Both you and your partner turn defensiveand begin to critique other faults: he never cleans up, she never puts the capon the toothpaste, and on and on. All the things you ignored in the first glowof love now start to bug you.If you met through an online dating service, both of you want your money back!He/she didn’t fill out the questionnaire honestly! But actually you both filledit out in good faith. You both filled it out consciously—and that’s the rub.Your thoughtful submissions from your conscious minds truly represent the peopleyou aspire to be. Unfortunately, the character of the “you” who answered thequestionnaire normally expresses itself only about 5 percent of the time. Whatboth partners failed to include in their surveys were the sabotaging andlimiting subconscious programs they acquired from others, which all of usunconsciously engage in about 95 percent of the time.With the appearance of uninvited behaviors 95 percent of the time, you and yourpartner have most definitively left the honeymoon and are back on the road ofconventional life. If any of these heretofore unseen, destructive, anddisturbing behaviors had surfaced on the first day of your relationship, thereprobably would not have been a second day. Now you’re wondering if you shouldlower your expectations and accept what your relationship has become, because“This is the way life is, and I have to accept the bad with the good.” Or willthe many compromises you make as you adjust to abusive behavior become sointolerable that your once seemingly unbreakable bond shatters? You say, “Thehell with this. I can’t do this.” And then you go out (again) and try to findwhat you once had.The culprit for this repeating cycle is invisible: it’s the behaviors programmedin you and your partner’s subconscious minds. Your conscious minds sent you onthe quest to find a loving partner and rejoiced when you found the One, yet yoursubconscious mind is destroying what you’ve created. But once you know thatyou’re dealing with four minds in the relationship, and once you know how tochange the negative programming of your subconscious minds, you will have thetools to recreate what you’ve lost.The High-Minded, Creative Conscious MindTo better understand how this happens, let’s talk more about the relationshipbetween the brain and the mind. The human brain is a physical device like aradio. The mind, both conscious and subconscious, is analogous to theprogramming you hear on the radio. The activity of the conscious mind isprimarily associated with the neural processing activity of the prefrontalcortex, the last evolutionary addition to the human brain.The conscious mind is the seat of your personal identity. It identifies you as adistinct individual, a unique spirit. The conscious mind manages your personalwishes, desires, and aspirations. When I ask you what kind of relationships youwant in your life, your lovely, high-minded answer comes from the consciousmind—I want a relationship based on love, equality, and respect as well assexual chemistry. This is the “positive thinking” mind that optimisticallysticks Post-it notes on the refrigerator that say, “I deserve a lovingrelationship” or “I eat healthy food.”This is also the creative mind that can look to the past and the future; it isnot bound by time. Your conscious mind can answer questions about what you’redoing next Wednesday or what you did last Wednesday. It’s the mind that can“detach” from the current moment and daydream all day about what mighthappen—you might win the lottery. You might meet Prince Charming.But wait a minute: if your conscious mind isn’t paying attention and “managing”the present moment because it’s busy thinking great thoughts or daydreamingabout the kind of life you want to live, who is left to manage the “show”?Neuroscience researchers tell us that because of the conscious mind’s ability toflit from thought to thought, humans, on average, use their personally creativeconscious mind to control their behavior-regulating cognitive activity (as Imentioned on As the [part0012.html#p72], but it bears repeating) about 5 percentof the time. By default, the remaining 95 percent of our cognitive activity iscontrolled by previously acquired programs downloaded into the subconsciousmind.1 [part0018.html#ch04_1]The Habitual, Record-Play Subconscious MindThe subconscious mind is the mind that, Post-it notes be damned, compels us tolunge for the Krispy Kreme donuts in the refrigerator or fall for the biggestjerk at the party—again. The subconscious is associated with the neural activityof a much larger part of the brain (approximately 90 percent) than the consciousmind’s prefrontal cortex. The subconscious mind is also a profoundly morepowerful influence on our behavior than the conscious mind. The conscious mind’sprefrontal cortex can process and manage a relatively measly 40 nerve impulsesper second. In contrast, the 90 percent of the brain that constitutes thesubconscious mind’s platform can process 40 million nerve impulses per second.That makes the subconscious mind’s processor 1 million times more powerful thanthe conscious mind’s.2 [part0018.html#ch04_2]You might at this point be developing a decidedly negative attitude toward yourpowerful subconscious mind that is sabotaging your best efforts to create theHoneymoon Effect in your life—and to stay away from donuts. (Margaret refers tothese as “circles of death.”) But the subconscious mind plays a most importantand valuable role in human development and in our daily lives. In any case, it’sa waste of time to fight or blame the subconscious mind, as I’m tempted to dowhen I scarf down a Krispy Kreme donut. That’s when my conscious mind beratesme: You stupid idiot. Why did you eat them when you just finished vowing toavoid them?I can yell all I want and blame all I want, but I’m wasting my time simplybecause there’s nobody in the subconscious mind to respond to my rant!Demonizing your subconscious mind is akin to screaming at your television. Isyour television good or bad? Neither. What are you watching? Don’t blame thetelevision set, blame the programming! Is your subconscious mind good or bad?Neither. The subconscious mind is primarily an amazing record/playback mechanismthat, unlike the conscious mind, expresses little creativity and has no sense oftime. It is always in the present moment, doesn’t see a future, and certainlydoesn’t listen or care when you yell at it!Rather than demonizing or battling with your subconscious over its bothersomebehavioral programs, it’s best to acknowledge its power. I grant you that thiswould be a very depressing book if I could only explain how your best intentionsand your best love affairs have been sabotaged by your subconscious mind withoutpointing you to tools you can use to reprogram your subconscious mind. Butthankfully, we are not doomed to live with our subconscious minds’self-sabotaging behaviors.However, before I talk about how to reprogram your subconscious mind, I’llexplain where all the negative programming came from (… not you). Then I’llpoint you to tools for reprogramming your subconscious mind so you can removethe invisible obstacles that are preventing you from creating and/or maintainingthe Honeymoon Effect in your life.Programming in UteroDoctors used to think (and some still do) that all pregnant women can do tosupport their babies’ health is eat well, take vitamins and minerals, andexercise; according to conventional thought, gene programs will manage the rest.But more recent research has laid to rest the myth that the unborn child is notsophisticated enough to react to anything other than its nutritionalenvironment. It turns out that the more researchers learn, the more they realizehow sophisticated the fetal and infant nervous system, which has vast sensoryand learning capabilities, is. “The truth is, much of what we have traditionallybelieved about babies is false. We have misunderstood and underestimated theirabilities. They are not simple beings but complex and ageless—small creatureswith unexpectedly large thoughts,” writes David Chamberlain in his book The Mindof Your Newborn Baby.3 [part0018.html#ch04_3]In a world based on genetic control, where genes determine an organism’s fate,science only needed to focus on the influence of the maternal blood’snutritional contribution in supporting fetal development. However, in the wakeof the epigenetic revolution and new science revealing that environmentalsignals control gene expression, we now know that the developing fetus isinfluenced by more than just the nutrients in the mother’s blood. Maternal bloodalso contains a vast array of “information” molecules, such as the chemicals,hormones, and growth factors that influence and control the mother’s emotionaland physical health.Now we know that the very same chemicals that shape a mother’s experiences andbehaviors cross the placenta and target the same cells and genes in the fetusthat they do in the mother. The consequence is that the developing fetus, bathedin the same blood chemistry as the mother, experiences the same emotions andphysiology as the mother.The fetus, for example, absorbs cortisol and other stress hormones if the motheris chronically anxious. If the child is unwanted for any reason, the fetus isbathed in the chemicals of rejection. If the mother is wildly in love with herbaby and her partner, the fetus is bathed in the love potions you read about inthe last chapter. If the mother is furious with the father, who has abandonedher during the pregnancy, the fetus is bathed in the chemicals of anger.In my lectures I show a video from the Associazione Nazionale EducazionePrenatale because it graphically portrays the interdependent relationshipbetween parents and their unborn child. In the video, a mother and father engagein a loud argument while the woman is undergoing a sonogram. You can see thefetus jump when the argument starts. When the argument escalates with the soundof shattering glass and even higher-pitched screaming, the fetus is fearful—itarches its body in a shock response and jumps higher, as if it were on atrampoline.This sonogram and other research make it clear that fetuses react strongly tothe environment provided by the mother and influenced by the father. Says Dr.Thomas R. Verny, whose pioneering 1981 book, The Secret Life of the UnbornChild, first laid out the case for the influence parents have even in the womb,“In fact, the great weight of the scientific evidence that has emerged over thelast decade demands that we reevaluate the mental and emotional abilities ofunborn children. Awake or asleep, the studies show, [unborn children] areconstantly tuned in to their mother’s every action, thought, and feeling. Fromthe moment of conception, the experience in the womb shapes the brain and laysthe groundwork for personality, emotional temperament, and the power of higherthought.”4 [part0018.html#ch04_4]The developing fetal brain not only responds to the chemical messengers inmaternal blood; it also acquires a memory of these chemical cascades that defineits in utero experiences. By the time a child is born, she or he has alreadydownloaded the emotional “music” of behavior, a tune that will endure throughoutthe child’s life. The child is born whistling a specific tune because he or shehas already been programmed with the patterns of emotional chemicals experiencedwithin the mother in the womb. It’s not a single event like the argument Idescribed that creates the programming—it’s the repetitive patterns of themother’s emotional cascades. After birth, the child goes about the job ofcreating life experiences that become the lyrics that match the emotional music.That’s great if the tune is a melody created in love, but it’s not so great ifthe mother’s emotional state was chronically unstable during her pregnancy.The nature of this programming is important for adoptive parents whose childrenhave come from chaotic backgrounds. These parents are often unaware that evenwhen they adopted a child as an infant, their child may have already downloadeda pattern of dysfunctional emotional chemistry that becomes the “music” for aless than positive behavioral song—the child is not a blank slate. Adoptiveparents shower attention on their children and are then shocked when thechildren they so lovingly nurtured start manifesting the behavior of theirdysfunctional birth parents.What they don’t realize is that the foundation of a child’s personality hasalready developed by the time of her or his birth. A new field of study known asfetal origins asserts that prenatal development constitutes the mostconsequential period of our lives, permanently influencing the wiring of thebrain and shaping our intelligence and temperament. In her cover story for Timemagazine, Annie Murphy Paul acknowledges, “… a pregnant woman’s mental state canshape her offspring’s psyche.”5 [part0018.html#ch04_5] The nine months in thewomb are so fundamental to human development in every area of life that Dr.Verny says he would like pregnant women to wear “Baby under Construction”T-shirts to broadcast this crucial fact. In truth, the mother (and by extensionher relationship with the father) serves as nature’s Head Start program. Throughthe mother’s physiology, and especially her blood that crosses into theplacenta, the fetus is indirectly learning about the world it will be born intoand actively adjusting its behavior and genetics to survive in his or herparents’ world.Programming Post UteroThe pace of learning continues at warp speed after birth. Babies come into theworld preprogrammed with some instinctual behaviors like suckling, but they haveso much more to learn before they can navigate this world by themselves. Nowonder evolution has endowed babies’ and young children’s brains with theability to download an unimaginable number of behaviors and beliefs veryquickly.One key to understanding how this massive download takes place is the brain’sfluctuating electrical activity as measured by EEGs. In adult brains, EEGactivity ranges over five frequencies of brain waves, from the lowest-frequencydelta waves to the highest-frequency gamma waves. But in young children the twolowest-frequency brain waves, theta and delta, predominate.6a,b[part0018.html#ch04_6]In the womb and through the first year of life, the human brain predominantlyoperates at the slowest brain-wave frequency, .5 to 4 cycles per second (Hz),known as delta waves. This isn’t surprising because babies sleep a lot; inadults, delta waves predominate during our deepest sleep, when we dream andwe’re hardest to wake up.From two to six years old, a child’s predominant brain wave is theta (4 to 8Hz), a vibrational frequency associated with the state of imagination. This isthe stage of development when a child’s delightful imagination runs wild. Whenyou see a child with a broom and he or she says it’s a horse, don’t tell thechild it’s only a broom! It’s a horse in the child’s mind, because at thiswonderful stage of life theta waves dominate brain function, a state in whichimagination and reality become entangled. In the child’s mind, the broom hasbecome a horse.Equally important, theta brain frequencies are associated with the state ofhypnosis during which information can be directly downloaded into thesubconscious mind. To induce this imaginative, suggestible state in adults,hypnotists use methods designed to drop their clients’ brain-wave frequenciesdown into the mellower theta range.For the first six years of life, children do not express the quality ofconsciousness associated with alpha, beta, and gamma EEG activity as predominantbrain states. Children’s brains primarily function below creative consciousness,just as adult brain activity drops below consciousness in sleep and duringhypnosis. In their highly programmable theta state, children record vast amountsof information they need to survive in their environment, but they do not havethe capacity to consciously evaluate the information while it is beingdownloaded. Anyone who doubts the sophistication of this downloading shouldthink about the first time your child blurted out a curse word picked up fromyou. I’m sure you noted its sophistication, correct pronunciation, nuancedstyle, and context carrying your signature.This ingeniously designed behavior-download system can be hijacked byhypercritical parents (and I’m not talking about the occasional swear word).Most of us grew up in families where we downloaded criticism from our parents:“You don’t deserve that. You’re not good at art. You’re not smart. You’re bad.You’re a sickly child.” Most often parents don’t mean to say that their child isunlovable; they’re acting like a coach who uses negative criticism to goad hisplayers into trying harder.Such parental coaching efforts require that children have the consciousness tointerpret the positive logic behind their parents’ negative critiques. But achild’s brain predominantly operates below consciousness (alpha waves) in thefirst six to seven years of life. During those years, a child is unable tointellectually understand that verbal barbs are not true; the parent’s negativeassessments are downloaded as truth just as surely as bits and bytes aredownloaded to the hard drive of your desktop computer. Critical parents have noidea that in their effort to help, they’re actually sentencing their child to gothrough life feeling unworthy.Here’s an example. A dad is shopping at Kmart with his five-year-old son. Theson spies a toy he becomes enthralled with and he has to have it now. When hisdad says no, the child throws a huge tantrum that attracts the attention ofevery shopper in the toy section. Frustrated, the dad gets upset and angrilyblurts out in his most authoritative, scary voice, “You don’t deserve that!” Theyounger child directly downloads the dad’s words and his rejecting tone at facevalue. I’m not good enough. I’m not lovable.This “not lovable” programming is one of the biggest impediments to creating theHoneymoon Effect in your life. In fact, when subconscious programming isassessed with muscle testing, most people’s subconscious minds reject thestatement “I love myself.”I learned about the effectiveness of muscle testing the first time I went to achiropractor after a serious motorcycle accident. The chiropractor demonstratedmuscle testing as a means of communicating with the subconscious mind. He askedme to hold out my arm and resist the downward pressure he applied to it. I hadno problem resisting the light force he put on my arm. Then he asked me to holdout my arm and resist him again, this time while saying, “My name is Bruce.”Again, I had no trouble resisting his pressure.Then he told me to hold out my arm and resist his pressure while saying, “Myname is Mary.” To my amazement, my arm flopped down, despite my strongresistance. “Try that again,” I said. “Apparently, I wasn’t ready.” So we did,and this time I concentrated even more forcefully on resisting. Nevertheless,after I repeated, “My name is Mary,” my arm sank like a stone. That’s becausewhen the conscious mind makes a statement that conflicts with a belief stored inthe subconscious mind, the resulting disharmony is experienced as weakening ofthe body’s muscles.In my lectures, I often ask the audience to muscle test the phrase “I lovemyself.” When the majority of arms sink, I ask them to think about how theirsubconscious belief that they are not lovable impacts their relationship. If youdon’t love yourself with both minds, what is the chance that other people willlove you? Very low, because your subconscious mind does not believe you arelovable. If someone does claim they love you, how worthy can they be when evenyou don’t find yourself lovable?Subconscious programs of “unlovability,” operating 95 percent of the time,unconsciously create behaviors that reveal how you feel. You may think it’s asecret, deep thought, but it’s playing all over your face in the words youunconsciously blurt out and the behaviors you display but don’t observe. Moreimportant, your dysfunctional beliefs are broadcast in your energy field and caninvisibly sabotage your efforts to create the kind of relationships yourconscious mind so desperately seeks.It’s not only words that get lodged in people’s subconscious minds duringchildhood programming but also behavior. In their theta-induced hypnagogictrance, children carefully observe as well as listen to their parents and thenmimic their behavior by downloading it into their subconscious minds. Whenparents model great behavior, theta hypnosis represents a fabulous tool thatenhances a child’s ability to learn all kinds of skills to survive in the world.And when parental behavior is not so great, the same theta “recordings” can dragthe child’s life into the ground.Research has shown that our close cousins, chimpanzees, share our ability tolearn by observation alone. In a series of experiments over a period of twoyears at Kyoto University’s Primate Research Institute, a female chimp wastaught to identify the Japanese characters for a variety of colors. When theJapanese character for a specific color was flashed on a computer screen, thechimp learned to choose the right color swatch. Upon selecting the right color,she received a coin from the computer that she could then put in a vendingmachine to select a fruit treat.Late in her training process, the chimp had a baby she held close to her throughsubsequent sessions. To the surprise of the researchers, one day, as the motherwas retrieving her fruit from the vending machine, the infant chimp activatedthe computer. When the character appeared on the screen, the baby chimp selectedthe correct color, grabbed the reward coin, and then followed his mother to thevending machines. The astonished researchers were left to conclude that infantscan pick up complex skills solely by observation and don’t have to be activelycoached by their parents.7 [part0018.html#ch04_7]While this study and others have wonderful implications for learning, they havescary implications for children growing up in dysfunctional households with, forexample, domestic violence or drug- or alcohol-addicted parents. They also havescary implications for less dramatically dysfunctional households. Just thinkabout the information many of us downloaded about the unhealthy aspects of ourparents’ marriages! But, you say, “I’m different. I have vowed to createrelationships that are not like the one my parents had.” That’s a laudable goalcreated by your conscious mind’s wishes and desires, but meanwhile your dominantsubconscious mind, programmed by your parents, is controlling your behavior.Since it’s sometimes hard to break through people’s denial about theirsubconscious programming, think not about yourself but about a friend you’veknown for a long time—you know your friend “Bill” and you also know his dad. Oneday you recognize that Bill shares some of the same behaviors his dad expresses.Casually you offer, “Bill, you’re just like your dad.” That’s when you hadbetter back away from Bill! He goes ballistic and responds, “What do you meanI’m like my dad? I am nothing like my dad.” The point of this story is thateveryone else can see that Bill’s behavior is like his dad’s; it’s only Bill whodoesn’t see his own subconscious programming!And guess what: “We are all Bill!” We think we’re acting out of the wishes,desires, and aspirations of our conscious mind. But as soon as our consciousmind starts to drift off in thought, it stops paying attention to the currentmoment. That’s when the programs of our subconscious minds kick in. We startacting like our parents, and we don’t even see it!Now, you’re wondering, when did the theta-induced download process stop? Aroundthe age of six to seven, children become less susceptible to hypnoticprogramming as their developing brains start to function increasingly athigher-frequency alpha waves (8 to 12 Hz). Alpha wave activity is correlatedwith states of calm consciousness. Finally, the child begins to experience asense of “self.”Let’s revisit the Kmart scenario, but this time the child is ten years old andhis brain is predominantly operating in conscious alpha-wave activity. This timewhen the child hears “You don’t deserve that toy,” he does not necessarily(except in abusive families) take his dad literally. He uses his conscious mindto evaluate the situation and tells himself this very accurate story: My dad’sangry because I’m slowing down the shopping—and he hates to shop! He wants me toshut up because he wants to finish shopping and go home and watch a footballgame. I know he loves me … and I did just get lots of new toys for my birthdaylast week …Of course, not all older children or adults are able to create such a perceptiveaccounting of their relationships. Even adults may fall into the samesubconscious trap when they are not using their critical evaluating minds andthey have a history of negative programming. But when children are very youngthey are incapable of creating such an assessment because, as I explainedearlier, they are not operating from their conscious minds. In this anecdote,the five-year-old child’s uncreative subconscious mind literally accepted hisfather’s response as a statement of “truth.” At ten, he can see the situationclearly for exactly what it is. But before he developed that consciouscapability, he downloaded into his subconscious a lot of negative anddisempowering information from both his parents and his community.What does this have to do with the Honeymoon Effect? None of the programming youreceived before the age of six came from your wishes, desires, and aspirations.It came from observing your parents and your community, and that is theprogramming that primarily impacts how you approach relationships. It alsoexplains the patterns of relationships: why some people look for love in all thewrong places, why some people can’t sustain a relationship, and why some blessedpeople live a charmed life when it comes to relationships. For most people, whodidn’t have enlightened parents, this is the programming we need to undo beforewe can enjoy the Honeymoon Effect every day of our lives.Reprogramming the Subconscious Mind1. Be conscious of what you ask forOver the years, Margaret and I have learned from personal experience a truth wehave often heard before: to help yourself and to assist the Universe in helpingyou, it is important to visualize and list exactly what you want out of life.Wherever our goals are unclear, the Universe does its best to fill in theblanks. Unfortunately, it’s what shows up in the details we did not plan on thatcan seriously undermine our desired goals and aspirations.With that in mind, before you start reprogramming your subconscious mind, itwould be best to step back and ask yourself consciously: “What is it that Ireally want?”I used to tell people to be careful of stating what they want because they’regoing to get it, until my wonderful life partner, Margaret, pointed out hownegative that admonition is. So I’ve changed the statement to one Margaretsuggested: “Be conscious of what you ask for because you’re going to get it.”Make a mental list of what you are looking for in a relationship. Fill in asmany details as you can imagine, the more the better. This is an exercise thatmakes sure your conscious mind is creatively engaged in compiling the list.Details left out of your description, by default, will be determined by thesubconscious mind, which if left to its own devices will list what your parentsor your community believe would be a good relationship.Write down the list in detail. As I said before, the more complete the details,the easier it is for your mind and the Universe to conspire in fulfilling yourwishes and desires. Instead of “I want a great relationship,” describe inmultisensory detail what you want in the present tense as if you already haveit. How does it look? How does it feel? What does it sound like? Here is oneexample, albeit a very incomplete one: “I love my caring, open-minded,affectionate, smart life partner, and I feel completely supported during ourquiet evenings laughing and sharing our life stories and interests.” By spellingout and broadcasting exactly what you want, you will manifest conscious andsubconscious behaviors that will attract the kinds of relationships you want inyour life.2. Review your subconscious programmingWhile we focus on defining the characteristics of the mate we are seeking, weinevitably fail to assess whether our own behavior, especially the invisible,subconscious kind, would be compatible with the kind of partner we desire. Forexample, maybe you grew up in a family where your parents never expressed aloving relationship and were sharp with each other. You’re determined to find amate who will express those loving characteristics you didn’t observe but nowhunger for. Your conscious mind will generate behavior to attract your desiredmate, but the predominant and unobserved subconscious behaviors you acquiredfrom your parents may invisibly repel any contender who expresses thesesought-after, loving traits.We are mostly unaware of our own subconscious behaviors, and on the occasions wedo notice them, it’s almost shocking and embarrassing. As a result of not seeingour own behavior, we tend to blame others for our failed relationships: Howcould someone as good as I am be the source of the problem? True, in ourconscious minds we are the loving people we think we are, but most of the timeour lives are invisibly shaped by subconscious programs that may not be solovable.So we need to answer the question “Does my subconscious programming support myheart’s desire?” If we are generally unobservant of these behaviors, how do weknow what our programs are? Since most of the programming occurred before wewere seven, and especially since much of our personality was defined before wewere born, our conscious minds may have no clue what was downloaded into oursubconscious minds. So how can we assess the character of our subconsciousprogramming?That is easy once you understand the interplay between the subconscious andconscious minds. Since 95 percent of our behavior is controlled by oursubconscious autopilots, not our conscious minds, by definition our lives arephysical printouts of the behaviors programmed in our subconscious minds.If, for example, you’ve struggled with money all your life, think back, as anumber of financial gurus now counsel, to the programming you received aboutmoney when you were young and how that programming is still impacting your life.In her book The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom, Suze Orman writes, “Messages aboutmoney are passed down from generation to generation, worn and chipped like thefamily dishes.”8 [part0018.html#ch04_8] Orman, for example, learned very youngthat the reason her parents “seemed so unhappy” was not that they didn’t loveeach other but that there was never enough money to pay the bills. “In our housemoney meant tension, worry, and sorrow.”9 [part0018.html#ch04_9]You can, as now wealthy Orman did, undo even the most negative programming. Andyou don’t have to change your whole life! Just focus on the areas where you needhelp. Maybe money savvy comes naturally to you, but you struggle inrelationships. No need to work on your subconscious programming regarding money.The things you like, the things that come easily to you, are already supportedby positive subconscious programming—that’s why you experience them. However,anything you have to work hard on, anything you’ve tried over and over to changewith no success, anything you struggle to acquire—those are the areas that mostlikely represent limiting and self-sabotaging subconscious beliefs that need tobe reprogrammed.Not only do you not need to change everything, but it’s not necessary to go to apsychologist to understand everything. You don’t have to rip yourself apartemotionally. You don’t have to focus on the people who are to “blame” for yourprogramming. It’s not necessary to kill the messenger. It’s the message thatneeds to be rewritten because it’s the message that has given rise to yourbehavior. So don’t waste time going back and dwelling on the messenger, becausethat effort generally stimulates those old feelings that were so painful andbrings them back to life again. All you have to do is focus on rewriting thosesubconscious behavioral programs that interfere with realizing your desires.A note: Before you seek a loving relationship, make sure that this fundamentalbelief—“I love myself”—is lodged firmly in your subconscious mind. A lack ofself-love, as I explained earlier, is a primary and huge obstacle for mostpeople who want to create the Honeymoon Effect in their lives.3. Start reprogrammingThere are a number of techniques you can use to reprogram your subconsciousmind. I’ll tell you three categories of things I’ve done to undo my own negativeprogramming (and there was plenty to undo) but do check the resources section inthis book’s appendix and at my website, www.brucelipton.com[http://www.brucelipton.com], so you can figure out which tools may work foryou. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription. My goal is to present theinformation about the destructive role subconscious programming can play in yourlife and, I hope, to inspire you to find the best way for you to undo theprogramming.Before we attempt to rewrite our behavioral programming, it is vitally importantto understand the differing ways our conscious and subconscious minds learn. Youmight think that when the conscious mind learns something new, the subconsciousprogram will automatically adjust itself to be in alignment with the newknowledge. Wrong! The two minds essentially behave as separate entities and donot “learn” in the same way.The creative, conscious mind, the “thinking” mind, can instantly learn from avariety of inputs. Something as simple as an “Aha” moment can produce a radicalchange in belief and in your life. Similarly, the conscious mind can acquire newbeliefs from school and public lectures, reading self-help books, watchingvideos, or going through the excruciating psychoanalysis of your formativeexperiences. But sometimes seekers get stuck, as I did, by focusing onintellectual learning only. Educating the conscious mind does not automaticallyreprogram the subconscious mind. In my case, it was when I used the awareness Ihad acquired intellectually to rewrite subconscious programs that I madesubstantial progress in changing my life.While the conscious mind is creative and can use that creativity to learn, thesubconscious mind primarily learns through either hypnosis or the creation ofhabits. Before you were seven years old, your subconscious mind rapidlydownloaded beliefs because your brain was predominantly operating in thehypnagogic theta EEG frequency. After age seven, the subconscious mind’s primarysource of learning is through habituation. How did you learn your multiplicationtables? By repeating the sequence of numbers over and over, you eventuallymemorized the pattern and could repeat it unconsciously. Repetition leads tohabituation, and that is the fundamental mechanism for programming subconsciousbehavior patterns.When, for example, you were first learning to drive, your conscious mind wasfully engaged with every detail, such as remaining aware of what you saw throughthe windshield, focusing on the dashboard gauges, keeping your eyes on theimages in the three mirrors, and paying attention to your feet on the pedals.But today you get in the car, put the key into the ignition, and away you go,with your conscious mind focusing on your destination or the party you went tolast night, or engaging in a deep conversation with a passenger. Most of thetime you are not even paying conscious attention to what’s happening on theroad. Who’s driving the car? The subconscious mind, using the habits it acquiredthrough the repetitive periods of practice when you were learning how to drive.Don’t be afraid of the thought that you are not consciously driving the carbecause, as I mentioned earlier in the chapter, the subconscious mind is amillion times more powerful and has a significantly faster processor than theconscious mind. In fact, if your car starts to skid off toward an accident,stress hormones will shut down your conscious processing to ensure that thefaster and more powerful subconscious controls the situation.Hypnosis and habituation are the primary means of programming behavior into thesubconscious mind. That is why conscious mind efforts, such as giving yourself a“good talking to,” reading a self-help book, or posting sticky notes have littleinfluence on changing undesired subconscious programs unless they are regularlyrepeated so as to create a new habit.a. Mindfulness/Habit: The first thing I did when I became aware that I needed torewrite my programming was to create the habit of mindfulness—I started bypaying attention to my thoughts! The goal of mindfulness is to make your everyaction and decision come from your wishes and desires; i.e., your consciousmind, not your autopilot, subconscious mind.What I learned when I started paying attention was not only how often I slippedinto automatic pilot while my conscious mind drifted off in thought, but howoften those autopilot thoughts were not helpful. Researchers have corroboratedthat 65 percent of our thoughts are negative and/or redundant.10[part0018.html#ch04_10]One way to start this practice is to observe your thoughts when you’re doing amundane chore such as driving. When you’re stopped at a stoplight, you’llquickly learn that stopped traffic is not dead time—thoughts are continuouslyrunning through your head. When I started observing these runaway thoughts, Irealized that they were not describing a reality I wanted to live in, yet theywere what I was manifesting. (Sample: I’ll never get there on time. I don’t wantto do this. This traffic is a nightmare.) As I’ve explained, positive thoughtsaren’t enough, but they’re a good start. So with intention, I began toimmediately rewrite negative thoughts as they popped into my mind, giving them apositive spin while simultaneously making an effort to consciously stay in themoment. Repeatedly rewriting a frequent and particular thought will generate ahabit that will automatically “correct” the negative thought before it evencomes into consciousness.Mindfulness is very difficult to maintain when life gets busy because ourthoughts are continuously flitting about and managing the innumerable details ofeveryday life. This interfering busyness is why Buddhist mindfulness is alifelong practice.In 2010 researchers at Harvard University found that people spend almost halftheir waking hours thinking about something other than what they’re doing andthat this mind-wandering makes them unhappy (even when their minds wander topleasant subjects). The authors wrote, “In conclusion, a human mind is awandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. The ability to thinkabout what is not happening is a cognitive achievement that comes at anemotional cost.”11 [part0018.html#ch04_11] Mind-wandering unhappiness, ofcourse, is exacerbated by the fact that while our minds are wandering, ourinvisible subconscious programs are often sabotaging our life’s desires.For this book, the most significant finding of the Harvard study is thatmindfulness is a lot easier when you’re making love. The study found thatmind-wandering occurred on average only 10 percent of the time when the subjectswere having sex.12 [part0018.html#ch04_12] This explains why honeymooners havean easier time operating consciously. When we stay mindful—not just when we’rehaving sex—the wishes and desires of our conscious minds will manifest in ourlives, which is how we can make sure the Honeymoon Effect lasts!b) Hypnosis/Subliminal Tapes: When we awaken from deep sleep, the brain’sfrequency vibrations jump from the slow, unconscious delta waves to higherfrequency theta. This is the brain state associated with imagination, as I’vedescribed. It is also associated with a state of twilight reverie in which oneseamlessly blends the real and dream worlds together. A theta-driven experienceblends imagination and reality, a behavioral characteristic best seen inchildren younger than seven years of age. As an adult, you may have experienceda theta moment when a clock radio woke you. In your groggy state you mixed areal story on the radio with a dream you were waking up from. This is an exampleof how you can blend imagination with reality.As you become more awake, brain EEG activity ramps up to higher-frequency alphawaves, whose character of calm consciousness fills your head. By the time youget to work, your brain is in work mode operating with high-speed,high-functioning beta waves. Hopefully, when you return home from the job, thefrequency of your EEG waves drops off sequentially as the brain slows down frombeta to calming alpha and then drifts off into theta and finally into delta,fast asleep.This ramping up and down of EEG frequencies means that twice a day your brainpasses through the programmable hypnagogic theta phase. So every day you havetwo opportunities to reprogram subconscious beliefs through a natural state ofhypnosis. Of course, as a number of studies have found, meditators can increasethe frequency of theta waves. For example, a 2009 study of experiencedpractitioners of Acem Meditation, a nondirective method developed in Norway,were asked to rest for 20 minutes and to meditate for another 20 minutes. Duringmeditation, “significantly increased theta power” was found, especially in thefrontal and middle parts of the brain.13 [part0018.html#ch04_13]Once I became aware that children download vast amounts of information in theirhypnagogic state, I decided to try this myself by using subliminal tapesdesigned to program positive thoughts and beliefs into my subconscious mind. Ipicked up a Louise Hay (the Grand Dame of self-empowerment, and coincidentally,the publisher of this book) tape to reduce stress and enhance patience. The tapeopened with a relaxation exercise designed to calm down the conscious mind andmove the listener into the relaxed, programmable state attributed to thelow-frequency alpha and theta brain waves.The first time I put on headphones and activated the subliminal tape as I wasgoing to sleep, my conscious mind stayed alert the whole time and heard thetape’s programming message repeated a number of times. By the third time I usedthe tape, I never even made it through the relaxation exercises before I fellasleep. It got to the point that as soon as I put on the earphones, I instantlyrelaxed. The neat thing is that the tape was continuously downloading positivethoughts while I was drifting into the low-frequency brain waves of a child. Itwas effortless. I just had to put on the earphones and I would fall asleep.The changes I experienced were subtle—they didn’t stand out like a neon sign.But things were not exactly the same as they had been. They were better. It wasonly after a period of time, when I looked back and reviewed the events in myrecent life, that I realized how profoundly my behavior had changed.c) Energy Psychology: The next step I took for reprogramming my subconscious wasto utilize a new method of healing called energy psychology. As you’ll see inthe list of energy psychology resources in the appendix and on my website, thereare many different versions of energy psychology. In spite of the widevariations in practice among the different modalities, one thing is clear.Energy psychology can induce radical changes in behavior within minutes and inmany cases, these changes produce permanent alterations in subconsciouslyprogrammed behaviors.I love these new technologies because they completely undermine the prevailing(and behavior-controlling) belief that change is hard or difficult. I clearlysee that statement now as just another disempowering belief that encouragesresistance to change. It’s also wonderful that these new psychology tools areavailable to us at a point in time when evolution is pushing humanity to makechanges now. Necessity is the mother of invention. We don’t have years and yearsto change human behavior.While no mechanism has been identified to account for the rapidity of behavioralchanges that result from these practices, the fact is that the changes are realand long lasting. Personally, I am most familiar with the PSYCH-K belief changeprocess developed by Rob Williams. I know PSYCH-K’s energy-balancing technologyis effective because it radically changed my life. More important, over the lastfew years I have heard from hundreds of people around the world who have usedPSYCH-K to successfully take charge of their lives.Until recently, the feel-good results of energy-balancing technologies weresimply subjective experiences of individuals. However, new 3-D brain-mappingstudies employing quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) and low resolutionelectromagnetic tomography (LORETA) have provided measurable, objective datathat reveal significant and lasting changes in brain behavior following a singleten-minute PSYCH-K session.14 [part0018.html#ch04_14]Brain-mapping studies reveal that PSYCH-K induces a “whole-brain state,” whereinboth right and left cerebral hemispheres begin to work together, a functionalsituation known as hemispheric synchronization. In our normal wakeful condition,we tend to operate predominantly from our left hemisphere, the side of the brainpreoccupied with logic. In contrast, the right hemisphere is associated withprocessing emotions. When the left hemisphere is dominant, we tend to overruleour emotional drives with logic and reason.According to neuroscientist Jeffrey L. Fannin, Ph.D., whole-brain activitypositively affects more than just physical and psychological healing. Dr.Fannin’s brain-mapping research indicates that whole-brain function is a“gateway to higher consciousness,” tantamount to a state of superlearningassociated with higher functionality and spiritual consciousness.15[part0018.html#ch04_15] Please understand that the PSYCH-K process does not workfor everybody. In truth, there is no one tool that fits all people. If one ofthe processes listed in the appendix doesn’t work, don’t give up; try anotherone!4. CommunicationTo create the Honeymoon Effect, it is imperative that couples learn tocommunicate on a deep level, and that kind of communication can’t happen if bothpeople don’t have the same level of awareness. When both partners are aware ofthe subconscious roadblocks they face, they can focus on turning what wouldnormally be arguments into discussions. “I don’t think you heard what you justsaid. Did you mean that? Is that a tape you’re playing? Is that a behavior youdownloaded from your father?” All of these discussion points offer anopportunity for both partners to become aware of their unconscious behaviorswhile gaining an understanding of how their subconscious behavioral programs canundermine a relationship.If only one person in the couple is aware of this behavioral programming, tryingto engage in change would be like talking to a brick wall. If one person is notinterested in or ready for change, then change simply will not occur. Changerequires a team effort!5. PatienceIf you come to a trouble point in your relationship one week and that sametrouble point pops up again the week after, don’t be surprised. Remember, youare trying to change lifelong patterns; change in relationships may not occurovernight. To break recurring dysfunctional patterns, you need to have patiencewith yourself, with each other, and with the stubborn habits that continue torear their ugly heads. If you can deal with the issues in terms of a discussioninstead of an argument, you are already on the path to a new life.For example, here’s a prototypical issue. The boy gets into a dispute with thegirl and doesn’t want to talk about it. The girl, on the other hand, wants todissect it. That could be a recipe for disaster as she keeps talking and hekeeps digging a deeper hole in his silence. In my case, when I finally came outof that hole, I owned that my noncommunication “habit” was delaying resolutionof our issues and realized that Margaret was earnestly trying to repair thepotholes that were showing up in our lives.Later, when I found myself in a calm, cool place, I told Margaret that while Iwas in the midst of that habitual disconnect process, I was still listening,even though I couldn’t yet engage. I asked her to be patient with me. I told herI wanted her to keep talking while I internally tried to escape from mydestructive habitual behavior. After that moment of deep insight and awareness,each subsequent time I responded by disconnecting, my conscious mind moreeffectively took control and terminated that dysfunctional behavior. Over ashort time, repetition rewrote that limiting behavior, and we now easily resolveissues without invoking unconscious, knee-jerk responses. No more confrontations… boy, is life easier. Yea!6. PracticeHow many times did you practice your multiplication tables until they stuck? Howmany times did you practice driving before you became adept? Similarly,subconscious habits don’t go away just because you say, “Go away.” You have topractice your new habits until they become automatic. A habit is not just wordsemblazoned on a refrigerator Post-it note. A habit is behavior you practiceuntil it sticks!Eventually, the tools I described will bring about the changes you seek. I’m ascientist, and my relationship with my partner, Margaret, who has taught me somuch, is an ongoing experiment in living Happily Ever After for both of us. Ican tell you for sure that I wouldn’t be writing this book if the experimentwasn’t working!When you remove the impediment of your subconscious programming, you are free tolive a life that is a creative romance, a dream come true. Once you program yourconscious mind’s wishes, desires, and aspirations into your subconscious mind,you will create a perpetual honeymoon. Even when you shift into automatic pilot,as we all do, formerly ugly behaviors will simply not rear their heads becauseyour subconscious programs will now match the desires and wishes in yourconscious mind. When all four of your minds are aligned, you and your partnerwill become the same lovable people you were in the first days of yourrelationship.image [../images/00016.jpeg]The above illustration of the seven main chakras, energy points that run up anddown the body, visually illustrates the romantic consequence of uniting yourphysiology and behavior. In this chart, the three lower chakras (the solarplexus, sacral, and root) represent the influence of our physical biology,specifically our physiology, in shaping our lives. The top three chakras (thecrown, third eye, and throat) represent the influences derived from ourconsciousness, our psychology. The middle chakra is the heart chakra, whichrepresents unconditional love for self and others.When all seven of the chakras in this illustration are aligned, there are noenergy blocks; energy flows freely through every chakra. The heart chakra in themiddle is purposefully larger than the others because when you align yourphysiology and your psychology, when you love yourself so others can love youand you can love others, your heart will expand and open to your partner and tothe world. By manifesting the life you choose, not the life you were programmedby your family to lead, you can have it all.Welcome to the Honeymoon Effect!"},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]CHAPTER 5 [part0006.html#vk6]Noble Gases:Spreading Peace,Love, and Tulsi Tea [part0006.html#vk6]Be the change that you wish to see in the world.—MAHATMA GANDHII hope I’ve convinced you in the previous chapters that you can create therelationships of your dreams. In this chapter I’d like to convince you that theHoneymoon Effect is about more than two people creating a wonderfulrelationship—it’s about “noble gases” spreading the healing glow of love aroundthis ailing planet.Noble GasesTo explain that sweeping statement, I need to go back to chemistry. Not to thechemical stew of love potions that course through your body when you’re madly inlove (Chapter 3 [part0011.html]) but to the elements in the periodic table thateither vexed or entranced you when you studied chemistry in high school. Youwon’t be surprised to learn that I was entranced (English class was anothermatter) and still am by the insight into the nature of the Universe that theordered pattern of the 118 elements in the periodic table revealed.The periodic table is a masterpiece of organized chemical information thatdefines the traits and characteristics of the physical universe. I am especiallyintrigued by the unique characteristics of the six noble gases, the elementscomprising the last column on the right of the table, a subdivision identifiedas “Group 18.” Noble gas elements include helium (He); neon (Ne); argon (Ar);krypton (Kr) … no, this is not the element that zapped Superman’s strength;xenon (Xe); and radon (Rn). The most significant aspect of these odorless andcolorless gases is that noble gases are the only elements in the periodic tablethat don’t (except under very special circumstances) form chemical compounds.The other 112 elements in the periodic table readily form chemical bonds withone another to create the physical molecules that make up the stars, theplanets, and the biosphere. The secret to why atoms create“chemistry”—specifically, why atoms naturally tend to bond with one another—canbe explained by comparing the structures of the noble gas atoms with the otherelements in the periodic table.In the structure of an atom, the protons have positive charges and the electronshave an equal, but opposite, negative charge. The number of positive protons inan atom is equal to the number of its negative electrons; hence, every atom iselectromagnetically neutral with no net charge. The magic of the chemistry thatcreates the Universe is not based on the number of charged particles in an atombut on their distribution. While protons are massed together in the atom’snucleus, electrons orbit around the nucleus like satellites.In the simplest description, orbiting electrons are distributed in concentriclayers (shells) around the central nucleus. Each shell can only contain aspecific number of electrons (shell 1 = 2 electrons, shell 2 = 8 electrons,shell 3 = 18 electrons, shell 4 = 32 electrons, and shell 5 = 50 electrons).With the exception of the first shell, the shells are made up of severalsubshells. When a particular shell or subshell is filled with its maximum numberof electrons, additional electrons are then distributed to the next outerconcentric shell. If that layer becomes filled, the extra electrons are added tothe next outer shell, and so on.Now here’s the catch: atoms spin like nanosize tornados. When a shell is notcompletely filled with its maximum number of electrons, it causes the atom towobble as it spins. Consider this simple analogy: the drum of a washing machinespins like an atom. What happens if you place a bunched-up blanket on one sideof the drum and start up the machine? As the machine spins, the washer begins towobble and bounce around, creating quite a ruckus. An unfilled electron shell ina spinning atom results in similar wobbly behavior at the nano level.In our laundry analogy, to stop the racket you open the lid of the washingmachine and redistribute the blanket evenly around the drum. Now when yourestart the machine, it spins in perfect, peaceful balance. The 112 differentelements whose electron shells are incomplete seek to balance their wobble bybonding with other atoms that have a complementary wobble. When bonded together,the two imbalanced atoms spin in harmony.The number of shells occupied by electrons and the status of the outer shell’sfulfillment define an atom’s chemical activity. Noble gases are unique elementsbecause they are the only ones that naturally possess filled outer shells.Because they already spin in perfect balance, noble gases do not normally seekpartnership with other elements and are therefore chemically inactive.In contrast, the chemical bonding among the other 112 elements represents theeffort of wobbly atoms to generate spin-balance. Thus chemical bonding is acodependent relationship; in such pairings, each atom dependsupon—“needs”—another atom to acquire peace and harmony. The key word indescribing these relationships is need.Let’s consider the character of a sodium and chlorine atom, elements that are aperfect match for each other. Chlorine (Cl) has a total of 17 electrons thatoccupy three shells: two electrons in its first shell (maximum capacity), eightin its second shell (maximum capacity), and seven in its outermost shell. Toacquire spin-balance, chlorine would need one more electron to fill a space inits outer shell (see Arrow B in the following illustration).image [../images/00017.jpeg]A simplified illustration of a sodium, a chlorine, and an argon atom. The atom’scentral nucleus is a cluster of positively charged protons and unchargedneutrons. Surrounding the nucleus are electrons distributed in rings thatrepresent the atom’s shells. Argon atoms spin in balance because their outershells are filled with the full complement of electrons. In contrast, sodium andchlorine atoms spin with a wobble because their outer electron shells areincomplete.In contrast, sodium (Na) has 11 total electrons in its three shells: two in itsfirst shell (maximum capacity), eight in its second shell (maximum capacity),and only one electron in its outer shell. To acquire spin-balance, sodium’souter shell would either need to add seven more electrons or lose its solitaryelectron (Arrow A in illustration on the previous page).Neither sodium’s nor chlorine’s outer electron shell is complete. Separatelytheir spin behavior resembles the wobble produced by the imbalanced blanket in awashing machine. But when sodium and chlorine atoms get together, they “makechemistry.” They fulfill this Universe’s tendency to find balance bycombining—they lose their wobble and stabilize. By creating what is referred toas an ionic bond, sodium loans its single outer shell electron to its chlorinepartner, which uses the extra electron to complete its outer shell (see thearrow in the figure below). Voilà! Through their pairing, each atom now has acomplete outer shell, and together they spin in perfect balance. This is arelationship based upon fulfilling each other’s needs.image [../images/00018.jpeg]As I explained in the last chapter, because of conventional familial andcultural parenting practices that are less than optimal, almost all of us are,to a certain degree, psychologically “unbalanced.” As imbalanced individuals, wehave a tendency to do the same thing that atoms do—we seek a complementarypartner who is out of balance as well. When two partners complement each other’simbalances, together they can spin “harmoniously” with no wobbles.While our conscious minds seek partnership with individuals who fulfill ourwishes and desires, our subconscious minds are unconsciously seeking individualswho possess traits that complement our personal, but unobserved, imbalances. Inan example of an extreme codependent relationship, sadists who love to inflictpain seek pair bonding with masochists who derive pleasure from receiving pain.In the unconscious process of creating codependent relationships, you won’t loseany electrons, but you may think you’re losing your mind living with theimbalanced partner your subconscious mind attracted, not the wonderful partneryour conscious mind envisioned. But even when your posthoneymoon relationshipdeteriorates and the partner of your nightmares starts to pull away, you may notwant to let him or her go! You may find yourself screaming, “Don’t leave me!”You know your partner is abusive, but you don’t want to let him go because heprovides balance, albeit a dysfunctional balance, in your life. And that is thedefinition of codependency!Remember the woman in the Caribbean I drove crazy because I wouldn’t argue withher? You can imagine the kind of programming she received as a child that ledher to link love with abuse and screaming. People will seek whatever theyrecognize as love, even a perverse form of love, because, as I explained inChapter 1 [part0009.html], there is a biological drive for coupling and abiological/psychological drive to gravitate toward what you consider love. Tofeel balanced, she needed someone to fight with! Even though she complainedabout her former partner, she didn’t want to change; she unconsciously soughtmore abuse. And one thing I’ve learned in my life is that you can’t changeanother person: unless someone asks for your help, your efforts are likelydoomed.Of course, as I’ve made clear in this book, I was no paragon of balance either.Remember the woman in the Caribbean who correctly told me I was too needy? I wasdesperate to fulfill my biological imperative to couple and find balance, but Iwas looking for love in all the wrong places. Actually, like the woman whoequated love with screaming, I was looking for love in exactly the “right”places given how cluttered my subconscious mind was with negative programming. Iwas unconsciously looking for a codependent relationship to balance my life.Noble Gases: Lasers and LoveNow let’s look at the chemical equivalent of the better way I described in thelast chapter. Once you’ve aligned your conscious and subconscious minds, you areno longer a sodium atom desperately looking for a chlorine atom; you become anoble gas spinning in perfect balance—you don’t “need” another element to bebalanced.You might think that makes noble gases strange elements to use as inspirationalmodels for this last chapter of The Honeymoon Effect, and I grant you that atfirst glance, noble gases sound more like Ayn Rand than Rumi! Poor argon, poorneon, etc.—they’re never going to experience true love because they spin so wellon their own that they’ll never need a partner!It is true that when people spinning in balance like a noble gas have theopportunity to jump into another dysfunctional relationship, they do not seizeit. Wobbly atoms around them can act as crazy as they want, but noble gases arenot drawn in; instead, they keep spinning happily on their own. As I tell myaudiences, “Noble gases can love the jerk, but they are not attached to thejerk!”It is also true that noble gases can live perfectly happily on their own. When Irewrote my negative subconscious programming (vestiges still pop up from time totime), I came to peace within myself—I was finally able to pass the “I amlovable” test, and, for the first time, I didn’t crave a partner to make me feelwhole. In fact, for a long while I didn’t have a partner and wasn’t missing one;I was living a life of passion, spreading the word of the new science that genesdo not determine our lives or our relationships. I had become passionate aboutconnecting with like-minded new friends—I was flying solo yet experiencing theHoneymoon Effect in my life.But, you persist, how can noble gases fare in relationships given theirpropensity to spin so well on their own? The answer is, “Spectacularly!”To understand that surprising answer, we must consider another characteristic ofnoble gases, their ability to form excimers. An excimer, short for “exciteddimer,” is a special bonding association between two atoms that would not bebound together in their normal state. When a noble gas atom is hit by a photonof light, its “normal” state is profoundly altered. The atom absorbs thephoton’s energy and begins to vibrate faster because of its higher level ofenergy. Simply, an “enlightened” noble gas atom becomes “excited.” A noble gasatom in an excited state will seek bonding, partnership with another noble gasatom so it can share that excitement! Excited noble gas atoms form exciteddimers (excimers) that are chemically represented as: Ar2, Kr2, Xe2, He2, Ne2,and Rn2.Unlike conventional “chemistry,” which is based on codependent bonding toproduce spin-balance and stability, energized noble gas atoms are like peopleprimed and ready for selfless love, a world of sharing and caring. By reworkingmy imbalanced subconscious programs, I believe I had become an “excited boy”spinning in balance when Margaret eventually appeared in my life and we createdour still enduring Happily Ever After excimer (see Epilogue [part0014.html]).I’m reminded of the documentary movie After Happily Ever After, a whimsicallyentertaining look (complete with a Las Vegas Elvis impersonator) at marriage inthe United States, where 90 percent of us marry but only 50 percent of ourmarriages last. In that movie, Stephanie Coontz, author of Marriage, a History:How Love Conquered Marriage, says, “This is the first time ever in thousands ofyears when marriage has been not only about love but also about mutual respectand equal options of men and women … When a marriage works, it’s fairer, morefulfilling, more protective of its members (both adults and children) than everbefore in history.” That sounds like a definition of marriage between noblegases to me!The excited relationship of an excimer results in its emitting extra energy asanother photon of light. Excimer couples glow! Under normal circumstances, thelife span of a glowing, solitary excimer is rather short. However, if there areother noble gas atoms in the vicinity, they can absorb that emitted photon andbecome excited themselves, which means excimers can lead to the creation of moreexcimers. This excitable characteristic of noble gases led to the development ofthe laser, which is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission ofRadiation.A laser is a tube filled with noble gas atoms that are then excited by energy.The energy stimulates the formation of excited noble gas dimers (partnerships).The activated excimers then radiate and emit their own photons, which in turnactivate other noble gas atoms in the community to form excited dimers. As thepopulation of activated excimers increases, their emitted photons ultimatelycreate a chain reaction that results in “light amplification” through theproduction of more and more radiating excimers. Only a dim glow of light isproduced at first. However, as the stimulated emission of excimer radiationincreases, the light gets brighter and brighter. Creating coherence among theemitted photons by aligning their light waves so that they are all in phaseresults in the production of a laser beam, a stream of light so powerful it canburn a hole through a steel wall.I once produced a laser light show, and I can tell you from personal experiencethat the kaleidoscopic colors, intensity, and purity of laser light have apowerful, mesmerizing impact on audiences. “Enlightened” noble gas–like humanscan make a similarly powerful impact on our planet, because they understand thetruth of entrepreneur, humanitarian, and philanthropist Bharat Mitra’s words:“Alive in each person’s heart is the desire to participate in something biggerthan themselves.” They gravitate to other noble gases as Bharat Mitra (Yoav Lev)and his wife Bhavani (Holly B.) Lev (founders of ORGANIC INDIA) did when theycreated a community that is helping to heal our planet (more on this later).It doesn’t take a rocket scientist, a climate scientist, an antiwar activist, ora cell biologist to figure out that this planet needs healing. There’s a namefor what humanity is experiencing right now. When the cells in our bodies fightone another, we call that autoimmune disease. What humanity, the superorganismcomprising seven billion people on this planet, is experiencing now is a verybad case of autoimmune disease.With the exception of human beings, all organisms that make up the biosphere arein cooperation with one another. We, on the other hand, are creating our ownextinction because of our disconnection from nature. Projections that there willbe no fish left in the ocean in 30 years sound like a science fiction nightmare,but they are a scientific reality and one warning among many that we have tochange the way we live. Whether it’s disease or social crises, all of thetroubles humanity is facing stem from our inability to understand that when wedestroy the environment we are destroying ourselves. Just as James Lovelock’sGaia theory posits, our planet is an integrated and complex superorganism; weare an integral part of this environment, and when we destroy the environment weare destroying ourselves.1 [part0018.html#ch05_1]If Mother Nature were to put human civilization on trial for perpetrating thisplanet-destroying, dangerous autoimmune disease, a defense team emphasizing theDarwinian belief in the survival of the fittest would likely point to stellarhuman beings like Einstein and Beethoven to argue that humans do not deserve tobe condemned. This argument wouldn’t get very far, for evolution isn’t about thefittest individuals in a species; it’s about the impact of the species as awhole. In this case, the collective actions of the seven billion people on thisplanet have created a track record that is abysmal and indefensible.Humanity’s options are clear: we can continue to do what we’re doing and go theway of the dinosaurs, or we can change our way of life. Despite our penchant fordestruction, I am an optimist. Evolution, as I explained in Chapter 1[part0009.html], is powered by the formation of cooperative communities, and Ibelieve today’s chaos will push us (some kicking and screaming) to the nextstage of evolution where loving, cooperative noble gases thrive.However, we can’t just sit in an easy chair and then one day get up and open thedoor to greet the new world. Evolution is an active process not a passive one,and every one of us has to be a participant. I subscribe not only to Lovelock’sGaia theory but also to his wise advice about avoiding “us versus them”thinking:If we are all to live well with the Earth and survive this century, we have tounderstand that to strive for human rights alone is not enough. We have tounderstand that we and all living things from bacteria to trees, from amoeba towhales are all part of this great living Earth System. Most important, we haveto act personally and not expect others to do our duty … We tend far too much toseek scapegoats, people to blame for the environmental troubles, whereas it isus all. We determine everything we do and we’ve got to keep that in mind.2[part0018.html#ch05_2]I grant you that it’s difficult to follow Lovelock’s advice when readingdepressing headlines about oil spills and corrupt business and politicalleaders. I find it a lot easier to avoid scapegoating when I focus on noblegases doing their part to change the world. That’s why I decided to end thischapter by introducing you to a few of the noble gases I’ve had the privilege ofconnecting with on my long and fascinating journey from agnostic scientist tospiritual scientist.Roses, Tulsi, and DignityWhen Margaret and I received an invitation to travel to India to meet BharatMitra and Bhavani Lev, we felt compelled to go. How could we resist meeting inperson (not just on Skype) a couple who had founded a loving community andcompany called ORGANIC INDIA, whose philosophy embraces Gaia: “Creation is one.The Earth is one. We are one.”Like many Westerners, Bharat Mitra (from Israel) and Bhavani (from the UnitedStates) went to India as spiritual seekers. In India, they found a guru, Sri H.W. L. Poonja (Papaji), and a simpler life. But unlike most pilgrims, they stayedin India to make Lucknow (the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh and wherethey lived with Papaji) their home and the headquarters of ORGANIC INDIA. SaysBhavani, “We felt called to start an organic revolution in India.” Acting asenlightened noble gas excimers, Bharat Mitra and Bhavani excited other“noble-gas” participants to create a community to share their light, not onlyamong themselves but with the rest of the world as well.They started their revolution in 1997 in the town of Azamgarh. In the ’60s, manyfarmers in this community had embraced the high-tech “Green Revolution” farmingmethods that Western corporations had introduced to India. They mortgaged theirfarms and lives to buy the promise of costly genetically modified seeds; andthen had to borrow more to pay for the synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, andmodern irrigation projects required to grow the genetically modified plants. Thegoal was to fend off the country’s famines that had once been consideredinevitable, and at first it seemed to work. Yields increased and formerlypoverty-stricken towns and the farmers who lived in them prospered.But by the time ORGANIC INDIA started its work in Azamgarh, many farmers hadbecome disillusioned and desperate. Their fields had indeed turned green but inthe process had sucked up so much groundwater that they needed to dig deeper anddeeper wells and borrow more and more money. The genetically modified organisms(GMOs) and petrochemical sprays produced an environmental disaster withdevastating consequences. Monsanto’s GMO “monster crops” accelerated depletionof soil nutrients, creating plant blight, which in turn led to an invasion ofdestructive insects. The farmers had to borrow more money to buy more and morechemicals to grow their crops to fend off pests that had become resistant. Inthe last decade, nearly 200,000 Indian farmers, unable to continue to work theirdepleted land and unable to make loan payments, took their own lives—many bydrinking the very pesticides they had been told would ensure a good livelihoodfor them and their families.3 [part0018.html#ch05_3]Unsurprisingly, when ORGANIC INDIA arrived in Azamgarh, farmers were suspiciousof more Westerners asking them to radically change the way they work. And justas a practical matter, they were leery of becoming organic farmers, because ittakes at least three years to certify a field as organic.Despite these suspicions, one farmer named Kailash Nath Singh decided to take achance by going organic on his small, three-acre farm. That small step couldn’thave been more symbolic; not only was Singh going back to the way his ancestorshad farmed but he was doing it with the ancient crop tulsi (also called holybasil), a wild medicinal herb that has been used for thousands of years intraditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) to heal body and mind.Now, thanks to ORGANIC INDIA’s subsidies during their transition, 15 years laterthere are 1,000 organic farmers in Azamgarh and 20,000 around the country. Thestories these grateful farmers tell are incredibly moving and a testament to thesustainability of organic farming—constant enrichment of the soil, healthierlivestock, fewer miscarriages, and thriving children. Says Kailash Nath Singh,“Organic farming has come as a real blessing for our family. Our succeedinggenerations will reap the benefits and realize how the land has not lost itsfertility due to heavy use of chemicals.”I can’t tell you how inspiring it was for Margaret and me to see women and menworking in organic tulsi, psyllium, and intoxicatingly fragrant rose fields(used in their fabulous Tulsi Sweet Rose Tea), cultivating their crops in asustainable way. They are literally healing the Earth one field at a time. SaysBharat Mitra, “It’s not only that they have sustainable income, not only thatthe environment is healthy, not only that their livestock is doing well, notonly their own health has improved so significantly, but they have the dignityof being farmers again. How beautiful. How natural. How simple.”The farmers’ crops are processed and shipped from Lucknow all over the world toconsumers (like Margaret and me) clamoring for organic products, which meansthat ORGANIC INDIA is now making a global impact as well. The company iscommitted to its vision of being a vehicle of consciousness; it is running itsbusiness in a way that benefits everyone who works at the company and theconsumers who buy its high-quality products. Says Bhavani, “Unless we allexperience that we are all of the same consciousness we’re going to treat eachother as if you don’t matter.”Bharat Mitra and Bhavani’s newest project is AHIMSA (Association for HolisticIntegrative Medical Science in Action), an independent research foundationformed by a collaboration of “integrative medical professionals, scientists,researchers, and visionary social entrepreneurs” all operating from their heartsand minds with noble gas–like integrity (balance) and passion (energy). As witha laser, the goal of the AHIMSA community’s “excimers” is to stimulateenlightenment in the world. With selfless love, they want to “liberate” healthcare from corporate financial interests by providing independent, evidence-basedresearch on holistic remedies that “support, inspire, and promote True Wellnessamong all people.”Margaret and I were honored with an invitation to join AHIMSA, and we’reespecially impressed with its long view of evolutionary progress. One of thequestions built into the planning process is sustainability: “How will AHIMSAlook to the grandchildren of our grandchildren?” This is a perspective that wasmissing from the unsustainable “Green” farming revolution, and we’re happy to bepart of a group that takes the long view about the health of individuals andthis planet.Conscious ParentingI’m the first to admit that I wasn’t ready to be a parent and that I wasignorant about the importance of parents (versus genes) in child development.With 20/20 hindsight, there are many things as a father I’d like to go back andchange. Now when I see my daughters and sons-in-law raising their childrenconsciously, in a way that means that these children, unlike their grandfather,won’t have to rewrite a lot of negative programming, I wonder how I could havebeen so ignorant. I’m reminded of Bharat Mitra’s description of organic farming,which could also serve as a description of conscious parenting: “How beautiful.How natural. How simple.”So simple that British psychotherapist Sue Gerhardt in Why Love Matters: HowAffection Shapes a Baby’s Brain couldn’t be more correct when she writes, “Mostof all, my research leads me to believe that, if the will and resources wereavailable, the harm done to one generation need not be transmitted to the next:a damaged child need not inevitably become a damaging parent.”4[part0018.html#ch05_4]There is nothing inevitable about generation after generation of bad parenting,and the importance of breaking this cycle cannot be overestimated. In theprevious chapter, I talked about how negative programming can underminerelationships, but I didn’t talk about how profound an impact good parenting canmake on our violence-torn planet!In the 1990s James W. Prescott, former director of the National Institutes ofHealth’s section on Child Health and Human Development, concluded that the mostpeaceful cultures on Earth feature parents who maintain extensive physical,loving contact with their children (for example, carrying their babies on theirchests and backs throughout the day). In addition, these cultures do notsuppress adolescent sexuality, viewing it instead as a natural state ofdevelopment that prepares adolescents for successful adult relationships. Healso found that children (and animals) that do not experience loving touch areunable to suppress their stress hormones, an inability that is a harbinger ofviolent behavior. Says Prescott, “As a developmental neuropsychologist, I havedevoted a great deal of study to the peculiar relationship between violence andpleasure. I am now convinced that the deprivation of physical sensory pleasureis the principal root cause of violence.”5 [part0018.html#ch05_5]Prescott’s persuasive research has been ignored in “advanced” societies wherethe natural process of birth has been medicalized; where newborns are separatedfrom their parents for extended periods; where parents are told to let infantscry for fear of spoiling them; where parents goad young children to achieve moreby telling them they’re not good enough; where parents, believing that genes aredestiny, let children develop on their own. All of these unnatural parentingbehaviors are a recipe for continued violence on this planet.It has been an uphill struggle to focus public awareness on the fact thatindividual empowerment, conscious parenting, and planetary peace are connected,even though those connections are proven by solid research. But I do believethat in the face of current global crises, the message of peace and holism,which is grounded in modern revisions of traditional scientific thought, isfinally being heard. One indication of increasing public awareness is that aversion of the “new science,” an integration of quantum physics, epigenetics,and conscious parenting I described in The Biology of Belief, received twoawards in recognition of its ability to create peace in this world.The first was the 2009 Goi Peace Award presented annually for “outstandingcontributions toward the realization of a peaceful and harmonious world for alllife on earth.” Hiroo Saionji, president of the Goi Peace Foundation, made itclear that the “new science’s” message of individual empowerment is more thanindividual empowerment: “[This] research … has contributed to a greaterunderstanding of life and the true nature of humanity, empowering wide layers ofthe public to take control of their own lives and become responsible co-creatorsof a harmonious planetary future.” The second public recognition of the “newscience” was the 2012 Thousand Peace Flags award from the UnitedNations–sponsored Argentinean Mil Milenios de Paz (A Thousand Millennia ofPeace) and Fundación PEA (Peace, Ecology & Art Foundation) organizations.It is easy to get mired in our own personal dramas and our own efforts to buildsuccessful relationships, but these awards put such dramas into a much largerand more meaningful context. The promise of the “new science” is not only aworld where there are no codependent relationships and no need to grapple withfour minds in a relationship but also a world without violence, because allchildren receive the nurturing they need to thrive and create a better world.Connecting Noble GasesWhile preparing to write this book, I asked my online community if anyone hadapplied the principles offered in The Biology of Belief to their relationships.The large number of positive responses, and in particular this eloquent letter,blew me away:Hi Bruce,Here’s how The Biology of Belief changed my relationship with my husbandforever:I sat on the soft vinyl seat gazing out the window as the light played on thewater outside. The train picked up speed as we glided along the tracks fromPortland to Bellingham. All I could hear was Bruce’s voice as I listened to hisaudio version of The Biology of Belief. I made a mental list of all the highpoints to tell my husband, Martin, when I returned. He was waiting for me at thetrain station, and before I could speak he told me about the great book he hadjust finished called The Biology of Belief.This was a watershed moment for us. We decided that it was time to change the“track” of the tapes that played in our heads. I took a PSYCH-K workshop as oneof the ways that Bruce suggested we reprogram our subconscious minds (aka ourtapes), and I taught Martin.We made a list of tapes that often played in our heads and used the PSYCH-Kmuscle-testing process to balance them. When we started the process, we livedmainly in the world of work with very little time for each other. We thoughtthis was just normal and didn’t realize the distance that was growing betweenus. Through our old belief “tapes” we were setting ourselves on a relationshipcourse that was modeled by our parents. I could picture us in later yearswondering what happened as we became strangers to each other.Now, we were letting go of tapes that didn’t serve us and recording new onesthat did! Through our awareness of this reprogramming, we started charting a newpath. We moved to a place with a slower pace and decided to create jobs thatembraced our creativity. A year ago I would have never thought we could havecome up with this: http://kck.st/ybaRPo [http://kck.st/ybaRPo].Our relationship is much richer now, and I feel that we are on the samewavelength when we see old tapes surfacing. We are empowered to address thosetapes and work together to continue charting our best life.Marcy CrinerWhen we followed up with Marcy before publication of this book, I learned thatthe project she and her husband listed on the website Kickstarter, an iPad appto enable kids to write and illustrate stories, did not get funded.Undaunted, Marcy and Martin didn’t engage in recrimination: “You should havedone this … No, you should have done that.” Instead, they decided to come upwith a new project (an online course) that doesn’t need outside funding. Marcysays that because she and her husband were no longer modeling their parents’relationships and had instead created a relationship their conscious minds hadchosen, they were able to deal with the fact that their project didn’t getfunded: “We were able to not blame each other. We actually smiled and drewpictures of the lessons we learned through the project.”In fact, Marcy and Martin have come to believe that the project was a successbecause through Kickstarter they connected with a number of people who providedencouragement: “It turned out not to be about money. It was about people comingtogether to support us in our vision.” This is another example of noble-gascommunities sharing light.The Internet is akin to the human body’s nervous system because it has thepotential to connect seven billion individual human beings together into oneliving organism called humanity. I can’t say that I know how the Internet isgoing to evolve (any more than I know exactly the specifics of how the planet isgoing to evolve), but I do know that noble gases who start an organization likeAHIMSA or a revolt like the Arab Spring can, through the Internet, turn theirmovements into global ones at breathtaking speed. Increasingly, those whorecognize the importance of creating a harmonious global community are using theInternet to connect humanity. That includes me. I’ve decided to take my ownadvice and not sit in an easy chair waiting for the next stage of evolution butinstead exploit the power of the Internet sitting at my computer chair. I wantto help connect noble gases all over the planet, not just through my books andlectures but through my website. If you have a story to tell and would love toshare it with a world seeking hope and light, please send it to me atbruce@brucelipton.com so we can post it. Through the Internet, we can buildenergy among one another that will make Gaia glow.Sounds great, Bruce, some of you are thinking, but are you sure Gaia is going tosurvive? It’s a question I get a lot, especially from people who are discouragedabout the chaos of today’s world. I am not a Pollyanna, but as I said earlier, Iam optimistic because I have had the privilege of meeting so many noble gasesthrough my work: people who are individually and collectively lighting up theworld. And as I explained in the first chapter, there are repetitive fractalpatterns in Nature and in evolution that offer insight, hope, and vision for asustainable future.The crises we’re experiencing will, I believe, force evolutionary change ascrises have in the past, though I also believe that it’s going to be a bumpyride up the next rung of the evolutionary ladder. At the moment, we’rewitnessing the disassembly of the structures people once considered solid,including religious, political, economic, and academic ones. Because they arelocked into old and flawed belief systems, I believe they need to collapse so wecan move past their limiting beliefs, like the “I beat you before you beat me”survival-of-the-fittest ethic, or the belief that humans are the result ofrandom mutations, or the notion that genes control our lives—outdated beliefsthat we have been laboring under for 150 years.I sit here looking at the crises facing humanity and I’m excited because Ibelieve they’re a sign that we’re on our way to the next level of evolution, anew belief system that will shape a civilization based on harmony andself-empowerment. I can’t describe the exact consequences if and when sevenbillion humans decide to stop killing one another and the planet and takeresponsibility for the superorganism called humanity any more than an amoebacould have predicted what would happen when 50 trillion of them cooperated toform a human being! If you had asked an amoeba what would happen, there’s no wayit could have imagined a rocket ship to the moon or cell phones or televisions.Similarly, it’s impossible to predict what will happen once seven billion humanscollectively recognize that they are part of humanity, a larger enlightenedsuperorganism. But I do know that it will be wonderful because humanconsciousness is one of the most powerful elements influencing the evolution ofthis planet.During this time of chaos, I advise you to avoid the temptation of isolatingyourself, allowing your biological drive for protection to trump your biologicaldrive for growth. This is a time for growth, a time for taking things in, notwalling yourself off. By all means take steps to protect yourself (I am storingextra food), but don’t stop at protection. Reaching out to connect with otherswill help bring about change.I use the analogy of the metamorphosis of a caterpillar to describe where we arenow. Under the skin of a caterpillar are 6 to 7 billion cells. Every cell is asentient entity and, in fact, the equivalent of a functional miniature humanbeing. Every cell has a job. Some are working in the digestive system, some inthe muscular system, and so on. Every cell is “employed” and getting “paid.” Thecaterpillar is growing. Its economy is growing. Everything’s in a state ofluxuriant growth—happy days are here.Then one day the caterpillar stops taking in food and stops moving. Inside theworld of the caterpillar, the cells start looking around and saying, “What’sgoing on?” The digestive cells get laid off because there hasn’t been any foodcoming in for a while. Muscle cells lose their job when the caterpillar stopsmoving. Then all the cells start getting laid off. The structure they lived inand created as a community is falling apart. The cells start to panic; manycommit suicide (apoptosis). The highly organized structure that was thecaterpillar becomes a soup of cells disconnected from the structure. “Oh myGod—this whole thing is falling apart!”But some cells, genetically identical to the panicked cells, respond in adifferent way. Right in the midst of the chaos, these imaginal cells see adifferent vision and they become the leaders that create that new vision. All ofa sudden cells come together again, this time to create something more advancedthan a caterpillar; a gorgeous, soaring butterfly emerges from the soup.I think humanity is now in “late caterpillar” when visionary imaginal cells (akanoble gases) are leading the way to a better future. I can’t help but believethat the number of these imaginal cells/noble gases will reach such a criticalmass that our planet will heal and evolve to a higher order of life. I envisionverdant, organic fields, loving parents, Happily Ever After couples, and anamazing new butterfly that emits laser light."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]EPILOGUE [part0006.html#vk7]Happily Ever AfterA Romantic ComedyStarring Bruce and MargaretScene 1: Girl Meets BoyI do believe I loved you from the moment I laid eyeson you … and knowing you over the last yearand a half has given time, space, energy,and real substance to my love and hasfed and nourished my soul. I guess thatmakes you Soul Food!I love you,Margaret— FROM THE MARGARET-BRUCELOVE LETTERS ARCHIVEMargaret: Just like in the movies, it was love at first sight across a crowdedroom. Or more accurately, it was love at first jolt across a crowded room, ajolt that literally took my breath away.Walking back to my front-row seat at the 1995 international conference of theAssociation for Perinatal and Prenatal Health, I saw the founder of theorganization, Thomas Verny, speaking to someone whose back was turned to me. AsI passed by the stranger, I let out an involuntary gasp and reflexively put myhand over my heart, where I had felt a jolt of energy.I stopped walking and looked back. Thomas and the stranger were lookingcuriously at me, the source of the loud gasp that had taken them by surprise asmuch as it had taken me! I managed to blurt out, “Hi.”I made my way to my chair, asking myself, Wow, whoa, what was that about? Themeeting room at the San Francisco Cathedral Hill Hotel filled up around me withhundreds of attendees, but I didn’t even notice. I was staring at the floor,trying to recover from my heart jolt. This was beyond attraction, beyondlust—this was good vibrations taken to a whole new level. I hadn’t even seen hisface!Finally, I looked up and discovered that the stranger was one of the speakers onthe next panel and his name was Bruce Lipton. At the end of the session, afterBruce had galvanized the crowd, I literally had to push my way to the front ofthe line of people crowding around him, all the while revving myself up:Margaret, this is no time to be coy. You have to go meet this guy. I reachedBruce just as he was giving his home address to a woman who wanted to send him acheck for one of his videotape lectures. When he got to La Honda, California, Iblurted out, “You live in La Honda? I live in La Honda!”So now I had had this incredible physical, visceral reaction when I walkedbehind this person and he lived only minutes away from me in the tiny town of LaHonda.Not long before that conference I had decided to open myself up to exploring(for the first time) a fully committed, communicative, and expressiverelationship, but, because I’d never had one, I had no clue how to go about it.So I appealed (not for the first time) to the Universe: “All right, Universe, Iwant a sign, a sign so clear that I’ll do something about it!” I was convinced Ihad gotten my sign!Like Bruce, I was reinventing myself; we had both stepped off the edge of ourknown worlds. I had left an intense and rewarding 16-year career at the SummitOrganization, a leader in the California human potential movement. I had alsoleft a 13-year relationship with my mentor, who founded Summit. Leaving theSummit family where I had grown up (I started in my 20s and left when I was 39)was wrenching. And when the company I helped build folded shortly after I leftand my husband died (we were separated), I could no longer avoid the realitythat the old life I had loved was over.At Summit, we offered experiential workshops, and our core message will befamiliar to those who follow Bruce’s work: “You are responsible for your life.”In fact, the first time I heard Bruce speak, he was explaining the work I haddone for 16 years in a way I had never heard before. I used the “processing”language of the human potential movement, and Bruce used the language of cellbiology and quantum physics, but I realized with excitement (yet another reasonto believe I had gotten my sign from the Universe) that we were talking aboutthe same thing!I loved my work at Summit, I loved our clients, and I loved my colleagues, allof whom were, like me, zealous practitioners of self-inquiry—we were just ascommitted as our clients were to figuring out why our lives didn’t match thelives we said we wanted. Unsurprisingly, given my passion for internal work, mygoal after I left Summit was to “process” (there’s that word again) what I hadgone through so I’d glean all the wisdom I could from it and walk into the nextchapter of my life with an open heart.But the first order of business was decompression. It was a joy just to sit andlinger over a cup of coffee without having to run to the next appointment on mycalendar, the next phone call, the next workshop booked a year in advance. Itold friends I was going to revel in my free time and independence. When theytold me they hoped I would find a new partner, I blithely joked that theyshouldn’t wish me a good relationship, just some good sex and a lot of fun.That all changed when I arranged a mentorship with Kathlyn and Gay Hendricks,who use body-centered techniques to unravel what’s truly going on withindividuals and couples. The Hendrickses had been together for 20 years, butthey could have been honeymooners—it was so apparent how much they liked, loved,appreciated, and honored each other. They are committed to what they call“emotional transparency” and define this as “the ability to know your ownfeelings and to talk about them so that others understand them.”In my work with Kathlyn and Gay, I realized that despite my stated desire forintimacy, in relationships I had always had one eye on a side-door escape. Iknew I didn’t need that kind of relationship again—I could do just fine on myown. But the Hendrickses inspired me to dream about moving beyond my pattern ofbeing with men I had to drag kicking and screaming into intimacy. I openedmyself up to the possibility of what I called Big Love.Scene 2: Boy Loses GirlDearest Wonderful,Thank you for loving me so well … even if Ididn’t behave in a manner suitable for such love.I love you a lot!Brucie—FROM THE BRUCE-MARGARETLOVE LETTER ARCHIVESBruce: You’re probably thinking that after Margaret’s love-at-first jolt, sheand I, two noble gases who had dealt with their negative programming (and in onecase even lectured regularly on its power to prevent you from creating the lifeyou want), quickly experienced bliss.Well, not exactly. We call our relationship a romantic comedy for a reason—thefirst “hour and a half” (actually six months) included a series of mishaps andlines in the sand more characteristic of high-level diplomacy than Happily EverAfter, as well as lots and lots of joy and laughter.Margaret’s heart jolt made total sense to me, which of course won’t surprise youbecause you’ve read Chapter 2 [part0010.html]. All organisms, you’ll remember,broadcast unique vibratory signatures. In this case, Margaret created a specificand unique vision in her mind when she was working with the Hendrickses, aneurological vision with unique brain frequencies. She then tasked the Universe,aka her supercomputer subconscious, with a search request to alert her when thecorrect harmonic vibration entered her field. When she walked behind me,Margaret “read” an energy signature emanating from me that locked in(harmonically … this is a good vibrations story) with the frequency hersubconscious was seeking.The fact that Margaret reflexively clutched her heart at that instant also madesense to me, because I believe the heart is the receiving and responding organthat reads our energy fields. When I had my cell-mem-Brain epiphany in theCaribbean that I describe in The Biology of Belief, it was my heart thatresponded instantly in that amazing moment of awareness. In fact, I often referto that moment as my “heart orgasm”—it was not only a moment when I “got it” butalso a moment that woke me up to my heart’s ability to sense Truth.While I understood Margaret’s heart jolt, I did not have the same experiencewhen I met her. I knew I was drawn to an attractive, interesting, powerful,refreshingly direct and honest woman, but I did not yet know what is now soobvious to me—I had met the love of my life!As I explained in the Introduction, when it comes to relationships, I am not aquick learner; actually, I’m a stay-after-school,write-on-the-blackboard-a-thousand-times kind of learner. I had made incredibleprogress undoing my programming, progress that I know enabled Margaret to comeinto my life. But vestiges of my programming still held me back. I wanted anhonest relationship, and I still wanted a relationship that didn’t require me toedit even one word of my 17-year mantra: “I will never get married again!”In retrospect, I realize I made what could have wound up being the dumbest moveof my life—I let her go! I didn’t want to mislead Margaret, so I told her Iwasn’t committed-relationship material.Scenes 3 and 4: Boy and Girl Begin Their JourneyBeing with you has opened up my love and I want tocontinue to expand in this wonderful love I havewith you and for you … I love waking upwith you and talking, giggling, and loving.I love your silliness. I love your laugh.I love our BIG FUN with each other.I love you, my darling,Margaret—FROM THE MARGARET-BRUCELOVE LETTERS ARCHIVEMargaret: When I heard from Bruce, or thought I heard from Bruce, that he wasn’tavailable, I did the right thing under the circumstances—I wished him a goodlife. But then I cried for days as if I had lost the love of my life, quite oddbehavior (though not when you consider Bruce’s quantum physics explanationearlier) given that I had only talked to Bruce for a total of a few minutes!Of course, it didn’t end there. After a few more twists and turns (all grist forScene 3 of our romantic comedy), we started dating. But we still weren’t exactlyon an inexorable Happily Ever After trajectory.Every time we had a date, Bruce would repeat his disclaimer that he wasn’trelationship material and just in case I hadn’t gotten the message, he made surewe met at his house and he cooked the meals; he didn’t want to be “beholden” tome lest that smack of a permanent commitment.After lots of soul searching, I overcame my qualms about exploring acommitment-free relationship with Bruce and decided I would take the risk ofgetting my heart broken. I vowed to learn everything I could about being fullypresent with another person (I gave up on the “fully committed” part of Big Lovebut not the emotional transparency part) for as long as our relationship lasted.So after I sat through Bruce’s disclaimer every week, we would move on to myemotional transparency agenda, which was all about communicating honestly:“There’s something we need to talk about …”What I soon learned, to my surprise, was that though I was definitely the moreintense, serious one on the surface, I had met my match. Bruce’s big brain andbig heart meant that I had to become more expansive to keep up with him. Istarted learning so much about how to express love. And more surprising, Ilearned a lot about commitment without his ever using that word. In truth,despite my passion for self-inquiry, emotional transparency was exhausting forme at first. It required being present all the time, even the times I wanted tospace out and not pay attention for a while. The temptation was to say at somepoint, “This is too much trouble.”Instead, I chose to continue and focused on enjoying our glorious timetogether—Bruce is so endearingly funny and sweet. We had (and still have) a lotof silliness, a lot of giggles, and a lot of laughter. One of Bruce’s neighborssaid she loved to visit her horses who grazed in front of his house (La Honda isrural) because she’d hear our laughter and it made her happy, too.The laughter started early, even before I had made peace with Bruce’s commitmentdisclaimer. On one of our first dates, Bruce suggested a game of Scrabble. WhatBruce was soon to learn was that I love Scrabble and I play it mercilessly towin! When I beat him, he was in total shock and very impressed that I had bestedhis formidable vocabulary. I told him I would have suggested a game the firsttime we met had I known how much my Scrabble playing would impress him.Actually, the way I beat Bruce was not by besting his vocabulary but by usingobscure two- and three-letter Scrabble words I had long since memorized—one ofmy favorites is oe, a violent Faroe Islands whirlwind. Bruce launched into acomic presentation of my win filled with the ridiculous words I had beaten himwith that was so funny I was rolling on the floor laughing. Beating me became achallenge for him and when he finally did, I said, “How refreshing!”We were having fun, and we were also communicating on a deep level. For Bruce,life had been serious for too many years when he was following someone else’sscript for a happy life. And I realized that I needed to lighten up and softenmy language after a 16-year career dedicated to confronting things now.Our friends started noticing how good we were (and are) together. Bruce’sfriends, who knew about his commitment phobia, were telling him not to doanything to ruin our relationship—one told him not to come back unless hebrought me with him. My longtime friends were telling me that they had neverseen a partner who matched my high energy levels so well.Despite Bruce’s need to repeat his disclaimer and my need to push my emotionaltransparency agenda too hard and too fast (lest I get stuck with another man whodidn’t want to deal with his “shit,” to put it indelicately), on some level,like our friends, I believe we knew we had started our journey to Happily EverAfter.Scene 5, etc.: The Bumpy Course to Happily Ever AfterThe course of true love never did run smooth.— A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAMBY WILLIAM SHAKESPEAREMargaret: Of course, it still wasn’t a straight path to Happily Ever After.People always ask me if Bruce and I argue, and I tell them at the beginning wecertainly did—and in ways that would be familiar to lots of couples. And then Itell the story of our pre-GPS road trip.It wasn’t a long trip; we were only driving for about two hours to visitfriends. But we got lost. I kept suggesting that we stop for directions andBruce kept making turns and trying to figure it out. Yes [sigh], I know,stereotypical male-female responses! I said something like “That’s not what Iwould do” but by then Bruce was so irritated with me and with himself that hepulled into a shopping mall parking lot, got out, and said, “Fine, you drive.”Then (in public) we were nose to nose and yelling at each other, telling eachother what to do and where to go.After a few seconds of that fierce confrontation, we stopped, stepped away fromeach other, took deep breaths, let out sounds like “Phew!” and “Whoa!” and gotback in the car. We were silent for a long while. Then we started to talk aboutthe amazingly strong knee-jerk reactions we had both had, how bad they felt, andhow they were not what either of us wanted. This was the exact opposite of thegood-vibrations heart jolt I had experienced at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. Thiswas a textbook case of bad vibrations! In fact, it took almost a week (Bruceremembers two weeks) before the “bad” vibes dissipated. During that time weagreed that that would never happen again. We had both been in those kinds ofvolatile, destructive relationships in the past, and it was really clear to usthat we were not going to do that ever again.At the time, it was a shock that we could still degenerate so quickly intointense anger. But now, with the perspective of years of living Happily EverAfter, I think it isn’t possible to have a really intimate relationship withoutsome dark stuff coming up—the kind of anger that makes you want your partner tosuffer a little to make a point, the kind of hurt feelings that make you want toexact revenge.After our parking-lot confrontation, we asked ourselves whether we wanted to beright all the time or whether we wanted to have a relationship. We chose ourrelationship. Then we consciously and subconsciously (we’re always cognizant ofour four minds) decided to take responsibility for being control freaks and workon ways to let go of our need to be right all the time!First, I came up with a technique for curbing my tendency to speak critically atemotionally charged moments. I think it’s a pattern we’re all familiar with. Youknow that what you want to say will add salt to the wound so you vow not to sayit. But you blurt it out anyway (that corrosive subconscious programming)because you know you’re right and your partner is wrong. The way I subdued thecritical chatter bursting to come forth was to go into the bathroom, look atmyself in the mirror, and have an eye-to-eye talk with myself: “Margaret, do youwant to be right, or do you want to be in love?” It took practice, but I did itover and over and it worked. After a session at the mirror, I would walk backinto the room having shifted my energy to my heart. My words were kind because Ihad chosen to shift my energy to unconditional love.Bruce and I also cultivated another technique that helps us shift from hurt,anger, or fear into unconditional love. We developed a habit, which has nowbecome automatic, of reconnecting silently with touch rather than arguing aboutwho’s right. Reconnecting means that no matter how bad you feel, no matter howmuch you think your partner hurt you, no matter how much you want your partnerto suffer a little to make a point, you sit together without talking or arguingto reconnect on a deeper level than words. If you let go of the details of adispute and make contact with each other, your hearts open again and everythinggets handled really quickly. You do have to make sure you’re touching—knees,hands, arms. Without touching you could wind up just sitting there stewing!We also got into the now automatic habit of using loving words to reconnectthroughout each day, even when Bruce is on the road lecturing and we have to doit via Skype. We say “I love you” all the time—when we pass in the hallway, whenone of us leaves the house, etc. We liberally use endearing silly nicknames(invented by Bruce) like “Goosie, Brucie.” And we also make sure we have lots ofphysical reassurance every day: lots of hugs, and smooches that provided anothersilly nickname, “The Schmoochilinis.”If you’re thinking this sounds a tad over the top, you’re not the first. SallyThomas, who works with me at Mountain of Love Productions, says that when shefirst met us she thought the constant “I love you”s were too “syrupy.” Then shestarted to appreciate them: “No matter how stressful things get, Bruce andMargaret always use accepting and loving and kind communication. They don’t holdon to things and become resentful. The Honeymoon Effect has not worn off.” Thenshe started to imitate us. “The funny thing is that it rubbed off on me. It’s agood way to be when you’re with somebody and they’re driving you crazy—you justhave to remember you love them to death.”For my part, I think constant reinforcement is a good thing. I do not take ourHappily Ever After for granted! Like Bruce’s, my nuclear family did not modelpositive relationships. I left home at 16 knowing I could take care of myselfbetter than I was cared for at home because I was the adult in the house. Ibelieve that our romantic comedy could have turned into a tragedy had both of usnot been aware of our negative programming, taken steps to overcome it, andreinforced our love with supportive and appreciative words (and deeds) everyday.In the end, good vibrations aren’t enough, which won’t surprise anyone who hasread this book! I’ve met people who were convinced they were soul mates becausethey were so attuned energetically, but their relationships didn’t work out, atleast in this lifetime. Before we could move on to Happily Ever After, we bothneeded to deal with the invisible baggage that was holding us back.Final Scene: Happily Ever AfterYour beauty illuminates my life—I am so dearly in love with you! I trulyunderstand the idea of Heaven—for you have completed my understanding.With love for you, my dearest Gooselini,Brucie—FROM THE BRUCE-MARGARETLOVE LETTER ARCHIVESBruce: So I told you I’m a slow learner, but in this case not that slow!Six months after we met, we were sitting in the living room, Margaret on thesofa and me on the floor leaning against the sofa, when I started to laugh, thencaught myself and stopped. Margaret kept asking what I had started to laughabout. Eventually, I told her I had almost blurted out, “Margaret, will youmarry me?” Margaret’s response to this momentous news that followed 17 years ofrepeating my “I will never marry again” mantra was “Yeah, riiiight.” In fact,that was her response for the entire week it took me to convince her I wasserious!Finally, I had realized that Margaret was the woman I wanted to be with.Finally, I had realized that I was already living the relationship I had longedfor. We were sharing everything and that included and still includes thebacon—if there are four pieces, she gets two! We were having fun and we were asintimate as could be.Though it was a milestone, letting go of my “never get married again” shavingmantra turned out to be a natural progression I didn’t have to think about much.The turning point for me came when I realized that I trusted Margaret with mylife. I knew in my heart that if I needed somebody to make a decision about mylife when I was incapacitated, she was the only one I would trust to make it. Inmy entire existence on this planet, I had never had that sense that I could turnover my life to someone else if necessary. To me, that realization wasmind-boggling—I had come to trust her that much.When I convinced Margaret I was serious about my new level of trust (and seriousabout not needing to repeat my disclaimer anymore), we decided to commit to anexperiment in Happily Ever After. The experiment/challenge was to continue whatwe were doing without any end goal. Instead, we committed to a Zenlike HappilyEver After experiment, a “be here now” experiment without any long-term goals.Seventeen years later (and counting), our Happily-Ever-Afterliving-in-the-moment experiment is still going strong.Like Margaret, I don’t think our experiment was necessarily ordained to succeed.We had a great start, but if we hadn’t made course corrections, if we hadn’tdealt with lingering unconscious behaviors, I don’t think we would have made it.Margaret has already described some of the habits of loving communication thatwe took time to embed in our subconscious. I think the “Honeymoon Weekends” weset aside for ourselves were crucial as well. They were three days (soonextended to four days when our schedules allowed) of cocooning, leaving behindthe “real” world in favor of our woodsy mountain retreat. Even now that we’rebusier and can’t always arrange for those weekends, we still have that accesspoint, that love and joy with and for each other that we experienced duringthose weekends early in our relationship and still experience today.Sometimes I confess I can’t help but wish we could have experienced that loveand joy when we were young. I once told Margaret that had we met in high schoolwe would have been high school sweethearts. She was touched, but then we thoughtabout it and came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t have worked. Had we met inhigh school, that pre-GPS road trip might not have been a one-time occurrence—weboth had a lot to learn (actually a lot of subconscious programming to undo)before we stopped our wobbly, codependent spinning and became noble gases!As I learned again and again in my life, until you get your own act together,you’re not ready for Big Love. What you’re ready for is one of those codependentrelationships where you desperately need a partner. (Remember the woman in theCaribbean who correctly told me I was too needy.) When you learn to spin inbalance on your own like a noble gas, Big Love becomes possible. In my case, Iexperienced 40 years of anxiety, though I have to tell you that now that I’mhere, they are irrelevant. It was worth everything to get here!I hope that by reading this book you’ll be able to shave a lot off your learningyears—there’s no reason you have to be as slow a learner as I was. Now that youknow about subconscious programming and how it can undermine your life and yourrelationships, I hope you’ll be proactive about undoing that programming,proactive about taking responsibility for the relationships you create in yourlife, and proactive about leaving your codependent relationships behind. By allmeans, if you like romantic comedies, keep watching them. But there’s a hugedifference between sitting and watching someone else’s script and writing yourown. Create your own romantic comedy starring the person you want to be and theperson you attract into your life.Writing your own Happily Ever After script means no more victimology, no morenarratives of the sort I used to create like “She did me wrong.” And please, noguilt for past relationships! How were you to know that invisible programming,which you had nothing to do with, was undermining your relationships?Move on and seize every moment of today. Let go of yesterday! And no excuses! IfMargaret and I, who come from Dysfunctional Street, USA, can make it work, socan you. Of course, if you’re one of those lucky couples who met in secondgrade, fell in love in high school, and are thriving in adulthood, mazel tov!You don’t need excuses or inspiration, at least in the relationship area of yourlife; your four minds are already aligned.Though I hope we can provide inspiration, Margaret and I cannot provide ablueprint for a Happily Ever After relationship because there is noone-size-fits-all formula for creating Happily Ever After. Margaret and I, asyou now know, took completely different pathways to get to the point where wewere ready to create our Happily Ever After. Though I can’t offer you ablueprint, I can offer you some resources and a handy Honeymoon Effect checklistin the Appendix that follows this Epilogue.I also can’t offer you perfection. Happily Ever After doesn’t mean that I’mperfect or that everything is perfect in my life. What it does mean is that I’vereinvented myself and my life. I’m living in the same world, but it’s really notthe same world I used to live in. Things (like leaky roofs, parking tickets, andthe deadline for this book) that used to discombobulate me don’t turn me upsidedown, and they don’t throw our relationship off balance either. Margaret and Inever lose our love no matter what other things are going on in our lives.Whatever happens, it’s okay.What I can offer you is hope for a better world.When you create a Happily Ever After relationship, you start attractinglike-minded people who form a buffer between you and the other part of the worldyou used to be in the trenches with. You create your own bubble filled with theglow of noble gases: those “enlightened” noble gases from Chapter 5[part0013.html]; that is, people who know there is another way to live.I believe that if our lives hadn’t become distorted by programming, the entireplanet would be part of this bubble. The entire planet would glow like a laserbecause it would be a planet filled with love. Albert Einstein once said, “Thereare two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The otheris as though everything is a miracle.” Create your own light and share it withyour partner and with others so this planet will glow with the laser light ofnoble gases, who every day create Heaven on Earth. Like my hero Einstein, noblegases know that we can live our lives like the miracles they are."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]APPENDIX A [part0006.html#vk8]The Honeymoon Effect Checklist [part0006.html#vk8] 1.

On my journey, Iacquired knowledge from a large number of teachers with whom I shared physical,emotional, and/or spiritual life experiences. Many were willing teachers andfrankly, some were not. Yet each individual collectively contributed to thegrand synthesis of this life-transforming knowledge.First, I would like to honor some very important teachers whose wisdom hasprovided me with insight into the fundamental secrets of life. It is withgratitude and appreciation that I thank the stem cells in my research and the 50trillion cells making up the community I have come to know as “Bruce.” Thefuture of human civilization is truly written in the wisdom of the cells.Once I embarked upon the path to living Heaven on Earth, I found myselfsurrounded by angels, the loving celestial beings described in all religions.The word angel is derived from the Greek word angelos, which means “harbinger”or “messenger.” Every angel in my life has taught me an aspect of UniversalLove, which for many represents God.An Angel of Light who has significantly contributed to and influenced thepresentation of this work is Patricia A. King. Patricia is a Bay Area freelancewriter and former Newsweek reporter who worked for a decade as the magazine’sSan Francisco bureau chief. She works on book projects and newspaper andmagazine stories that focus on health issues, especially mind-body medicine andthe role stress plays in disease. A native of Boston, Patricia lives in MarinCounty, California.As I experienced in our earlier collaborative effort that resulted in thebestselling The Biology of Belief, I found Patricia to be a loving colleague andremarkable editor. As many will attest, I am a man of several million words, andmy Angel Patricia whittled me down to the 40,000 readable, informative, andfrequently humorous words in this book.A contributing angel with an artist’s flair is my dear “spiritual” son BobMueller, creator of the beautiful visionary art that graces the cover. Ashappened with The Biology of Belief and Spontaneous Evolution, I spin a tale toBob and he weaves a visually stunning image that captures the deep essence ofthe work. Thank you, dear Bob—that’s three winners for three covers! Bob iscofounder and creative director of Lightspeed Design in Bellevue, Washington. Heand his company have produced award-winning 3-D technology and amazing light andsound shows for corporations, science museums, and planetariums around theworld. Bob’s creative endeavors can be sampled at www.lightspeeddesign.com[http://www.lightspeeddesign.com].Special appreciation goes out to the band of loving angels who gathered togetherto review the manuscript, critique the work, and provide invaluable feedbackused in fine-tuning the text. I send love to each of the following dear andtrusted friends, who played a significant and vital role in bringing this bookto you. In random order, they are: Shelly Keller, Diana Sutter, Susan Mayginnes,Curt Rexroth, Terry and Christine Bugno, Theresa and Vaughan Wiles, Robert andSusan Mueller, Joan Borysenko and Gordon Dveirin, Patricia Gift, Ned Leavitt,Barry and Karen Rushton, Sherry Burton, Reinhard and Michaela Fuchs, and Bhavaniand Bharat Mitra Lev. Special appreciation goes out to Sally Thomas: more than areader, she’s our friend and loving colleague.I am forever grateful for the love and support offered by my family, who stayedwith me no matter how strange things had become. I acknowledge the love andappreciation for my sister, Marsha, and brother, David, for sharing the pain andlaughter that marked our journey into life. I am thankful for seeing Heaven onEarth materialized in the lives of my daughter Tanya; her love, Jean-Brice; mygrandchildren Jean-Gabrielle and Lily-Anabelle; and my daughter Jennifer, herlife-partner Stef, and my grandson, Miles.And the best for last … the message in this book and all the Heaven on Earthwould be personally meaningless were it not for the love I share with my dearestfriend and teacher, Margaret Horton. Margaret is my Angel of Love and Light, myinspiration and guide on this fabulous journey of awakening. The love we shareis a blessing from the Universe."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00001.jpeg]ABOUT THE AUTHOR [part0006.html#vk13]Bruce H.
