It is magnificent, profound beyond words, and a delight to read. Itsynthesizes an encyclopedia of critical new information into a brilliant yetsimple package. These pages contain a genuine revolution in thought andunderstanding, one so radical that it can change the world.”— Joseph Chilton Pearce, Ph.D.,author of Magical Child and Evolution’s End“Bruce Lipton’s delightfully written The Biology of Belief is a much neededantidote to the ‘bottom-up’ materialism of today’s society. The idea that DNAencodes all of life’s development is being successfully employed in geneticengineering. At the same time, the shortfall of this approach is becomingevident. The Biology of Belief is a review of a quarter-century of pioneeringresults in Epigenetics, heralded by The Wall Street Science Journal in mid-2004as an important new field. Its personal style makes it eminently readable andenjoyable.”— Karl H. Pribram, M.D., Ph.D.,(Hon. Multi), professor emeritus, Stanford University“Dr. Lipton is a genius. His breakthrough discoveries give us tools forregaining the sovereignty over our lives. I recommend this book to anyone who isready and willing to take full responsibility for themselves and the destiny ofour planet.”— LeVar Burton, actor and director“Bruce Lipton offers new insights and understanding into the interface betweenbiological organisms, the environment—and the influence of thought, perception,and subconscious awareness—on the expression of one’s body healing potential.Well-referenced explanations and examples make this book a refreshing ‘mustread’ for the student of the biological, social, and health care sciences. Yetthe clarity of the author’s presentation makes it an enjoyable read for ageneral audience.”— Carl Cleveland III, D.C.,President, Cleveland Chiropractic College“Dr. Lipton’s revolutionary research has uncovered the missing connectionsbetween biology, psychology, and spirituality. If you want to understand thedeepest mysteries of life, this is one of the most important books you will everread.”—Dennis Perman, D.C., co-founder, The Master’s Circle“In this paradigm-busting book, Bruce Lipton delivers a TKO to Old Biology. Witha left to Darwinian dogma and a right to allopathic medicine, he breaks out ofthe physicalist box into enlightenment on the mind/body (belief/biology) system.Must read, much fun.”— Ralph Abraham, Ph.D., professor of mathematics, University of California;author of Chaos, Gaia, Eros“Powerful! Elegant! Simple! In a style that is as accessible as it ismeaningful, Dr. Bruce Lipton offers nothing less than the long sought-after‘missing link’ between life and consciousness. In doing so, he answers theoldest questions and solves the deepest mysteries of our past. I have no doubtthat The Biology of Belief will become a cornerstone for the science of the newmillennium.”— Gregg Braden, best-selling author of The God Code and The Divine Matrix“I finished reading this book with the same sense of profound respect I havewhen I am with Bruce Lipton—that I have been touched by a revolutionary sense ofthe truth. He is both a scientist and a philosopher; a scientist in that heprovides us with tools to alter cultural consciousness and a philosopher becausehe challenges our beliefs about the very nature of our perceived reality. He ishelping us create our own futures.”— Guy F. Riekeman, D.C.,President, Life University and College of Chiropractic“The Biology of Belief is a milestone for evolving humanity. Dr. Bruce Liptonhas provided, through his amazing research and in this inspiring book, a new,more awakened science of human growth and transformation. Instead of beinglimited by the genetic or biological constraints that humanity has beenprogrammed to live by, humanity now has before it a way of unleashing its truespiritual potential with the help of simply transformed beliefs guided by ‘thegentle and loving hand of God.’ A definite must read for those dedicated to themind/body movement and to the true essence of healing.”— Dr. John F. Demartini, best-selling author of Count Your Blessings and TheBreakthrough Experience“In a world of chaos, Dr. Lipton brings clarity to mankind. His work isthought-provoking, insightful, and will hopefully lead people to ask betterquality questions in their lives and to make better decisions. One of the mostexciting books I have read, this is a must read.”— Brian Kelly, D.C., President, New Zealand College of Chiropractic; President,Australian Spinal Research Foundation“Finally, a compelling and easy-to-understand explanation of how your emotionsregulate your genetic expression! You need to read this book to truly appreciatethat you are not a victim of your genes but instead have unlimited capacity tolive a life overflowing with peace, happiness, and love.”— Joseph Mercola, D.O., Founder of www.mercola.com [http://www.mercola.com],world’s mostvisited natural-health site“This book is an absolute must read if you want to know, from a scientific viewpoint, that your lifestyle is in control of your health rather than yourgenetics. From a scientific viewpoint, Lipton demonstrates that the mind is morepowerful than drugs to regain our health. The information reveals that yourhealth is more your responsibility than just being a victim of your genes. WhenI started reading this book, I could not stop until it was finished.”— M. T. Morter, Jr., D.C.,founder, Morter Health System;developer of the B.E.S.T. Technique“This is a courageous and visionary book that provides solid evidence fromquantum biology to dispel the myth of genetic determinism—and implicitly,victimhood. Dr. Bruce Lipton brings a solid scientific mind to not only informbut to transform and empower the reader with the realization that our beliefscreate every aspect of our personal reality. A provocative and inspiring read!”— Lee Pulos, Ph.D., A.B.P.P.,professor emeritus, University of British Columbia;author of Miracles and OtherRealities and Beyond Hypnosis“History will record The Biology of Belief as one of the most important writingsof our time. Bruce Lipton has delivered the missing link between theunderstandings of biomedicine of the past and the essentials of energetichealing of the future. His complex insights are expressed in a readilyunderstandable fashion with a style that welcomes the scientist and thenonscientist on an equal footing. For anyone interested in health, thewell-being of the species, and the future of human life, The Biology of Beliefis a must read. The implications of the perspectives outlined have the potentialto change the world as we know it. Bruce Lipton’s understandings—and his conciseexpression of them—are sheer genius.”— Gerard W.

I was obsessed with the fantasy ofchanging my identity because I wanted to be anybody but me. I had a good careeras a cell biologist and medical school professor, but that didn’t make up forthe fact that my personal life was, at best, a shambles. The harder I tried tofind happiness and satisfaction in my personal life, the more dissatisfied andunhappy I became. In my reflective moments, I resolved to surrender to myunhappy life. I decided that fate had dealt me a bad hand, and I should simplyaccept it. Que sera, sera.In the fall of 1985, my depressed, fatalistic attitude changed in onetransformational moment. I had resigned my tenured position at the University ofWisconsin’s School of Medicine and was teaching at an offshore medical collegein the Caribbean. Because the school was so far from the academic mainstream, Ihad the opportunity to think outside the rigid parameters of belief that prevailin conventional academia. Far from the ivory towers, isolated on an emeraldisland in the deep azure Caribbean Sea, I experienced a scientific epiphany thatshattered my beliefs about the nature of life.My life-changing moment occurred while I was reviewing my research on themechanisms by which cells control their physiology and behavior. Suddenly Irealized that a cell’s life is controlled by the physical and energeticenvironment and not by its genes. Genes are simply molecular blueprints used inthe construction of cells, tissues, and organs. The environment serves as a“contractor” who reads and engages those genetic blueprints and is ultimatelyresponsible for the character of a cell’s life. It is a single cell’s“awareness” of the environment, not its genes, that sets into motion themechanisms of life.As a cell biologist I knew that my insights had powerful ramifications for mylife and the lives of all human beings. I was acutely aware that each of us ismade up of approximately fifty trillion single cells. I had devoted myprofessional life to better understanding single cells because I knew then andknow now that the better we understand single cells the better we can understandthe community of cells that comprises each human body and that if single cellsare controlled by their awareness of the environment so too are wetrillion-celled human beings. Just like a single cell, the character of ourlives is determined not by our genes but by our responses to the environmentalsignals that propel life.On the one hand, my new understanding of the nature of life was a jolt. Forclose to two decades I had been programming biology’s central dogma—the beliefthat life is controlled by genes—into the minds of medical students. On theother hand, my new understanding was not a complete surprise. I had always hadniggling doubts about genetic determinism. Some of those doubts stemmed from myeighteen years of government-funded research on cloning stem cells. Though ittook a sojourn outside of traditional academia for me to fully realize it, myresearch offered incontrovertible proof that biology’s most cherished tenetsregarding genetic determinism are fundamentally flawed.My new understanding of the nature of life not only corroborated my stem cellresearch but also, I realized, contradicted another belief of mainstream sciencethat I had been propounding to my students—the belief that allopathic medicineis the only kind of medicine that merits consideration in medical school. Byfinally giving the energy-based environment its due, it provided for a grandconvergence uniting the science and practice of allopathic medicine,complementary medicine, and the spiritual wisdom of ancient and modern faiths.On a personal level, I knew at the moment of insight that I had gotten myselfstuck simply by believing that I was fated to have a spectacularly unsuccessfulpersonal life. There is no doubt that human beings have a great capacity forsticking to false beliefs with great passion and tenacity, and hyper-rationalscientists are not immune. Our well-developed nervous system, headed by our bigbrain, is testament that our awareness is far more complicated than that of asingle cell. When our uniquely human minds get involved, we can choose toperceive the environment in different ways, unlike a single cell whose awarenessis more reflexive.I was exhilarated by the new realization that I could change the character of mylife by changing my beliefs. I was instantly energized because I realized thatthere was a science-based path that would take me from my job as a perennial“victim” to my new position as “co-creator” of my destiny.It has been more than twenty years since that magical night in the Caribbean.Throughout the intervening years, biological research has continued tocorroborate the knowledge I gained on that early morning. Today, two newlyevolved fields of science representing the most important areas of biomedicalresearch substantiate the conclusions offered in The Biology of Belief.First, the science of Signal Transduction focuses upon the biochemical pathwaysby which cells respond to environmental cues. Environmental signals engagecytoplasmic processes that can alter gene expression and thereby control cellfate, influence cell movement, control cell survival, or even sentence a cell todeath. Signal transduction science recognizes that the fate and behavior of anorganism is directly linked to its perception of the environment. In simpleterms, the character of our life is based upon how we perceive it.Second, the new science of Epigenetics, which literally means “control above thegenes,” has completely upended our conventional understanding of geneticcontrol. Epigenetics is the science of how environmental signals select, modify,and regulate gene activity. This new awareness reveals that our genes areconstantly being remodeled in response to life experiences. Which againemphasizes that our perceptions of life shape our biology.Months after this book was first published, an article in one of the mostprestigious journals, Nature, revealed exciting new epigenetic insights on howthe environment controls gene activity in stem cells, which coincidently is thesame subject and conclusion I offer in Chapter 2. I must admit that I was amusedby the fact that my chapter is entitled “It’s the Environment, Stupid” while themore recent Nature article was titled “It’s the Ecology, Stupid.” (2005 Nature435:268) Essentially, we are on the same page!Some scientists in reviewing this book asked, “So what’s new about this work?”Leading-edge scientists are familiar with the concepts proposed herein, andthat’s a good thing. The problem is related to the fact that over 99 percent ofthe rest of the population, the “lay audience,” is still operating fromantiquated and disem-powering beliefs about being victims of their genes.While research scientists might be familiar with this new and truly radicalshift in awareness, these insights have yet to trickle down to the generalpublic. The media worsens the situation by misleading the public with anever-ending onslaught of stories presumably identifying a gene that controlsthis cancer or that malady. Consequently, the intention behind this book is totranslate the significance of this leading-edge science so that it is accessibleto the lay audience. It is my sincerest hope that you will recognize that manyof the beliefs propelling your life are false and self-limiting and you will beinspired to change those beliefs. Understanding on a scientific level how cellsrespond to your thoughts and perceptions illuminates the path to personalempowerment. The insights we gain through this new biology unleash the power ofconsciousness, matter, and miracles.The Biology of Belief is not a self-help book; it is a self-empowerment book.The information offers knowledge of self and from that knowledge comes the powerto control your life.This information is powerful. I know it is. The life I have created using thisawareness is so much richer and satisfying that I no longer ask myself: “If Icould be anybody, who would I be?” For now, the answer is a no-brainer. I wantto be me!"},{"pageContent":"Introduction [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3251]The Magic of CellsI was seven years old when I stepped up onto a small box in Mrs. Novak’s secondgrade classroom, high enough to plop my eye right onto the lens and eyepiece ofa microscope. Alas, I was too close to see anything but a blob of light. FinallyI calmed down enough to listen to instructions to back off from the eyepiece.And then it happened, an event so dramatic that it would set the course for therest of my life. A paramecium swam into the field. I was mesmerized. The raucousdin of the other kids faded, as did the back-to-school smells of freshlysharpened pencils, new waxy crayons, and plastic Roy Rogers pencil cases. Mywhole being was transfixed by the alien world of this cell that, for me, wasmore exciting than today’s computer-animated special-effects movies.In the innocence of my child mind, I saw this organism not as a cell but as amicroscopic person, a thinking, sentient being. Rather than aimlessly movingaround, this microscopic, single-celled organism appeared to me to be on amission, though what kind of mission I didn’t know. I quietly watched over theparamecium’s “shoulder” as it busily comported itself in and around the algalmat. While I was focusing on the paramecium, a large pseudopod of a ganglyamoeba began to ooze into the field.Just then my visit to this Lilliputian world ended abruptly when Glenn, theclass bully, yanked me off the step and demanded his turn at the microscope. Itried to get Mrs. Novak’s attention, hoping that Glenn’s personal foul would getme another minute at the microscope free-throw line. But it was just minutesbefore lunch time and the other kids in line were clamoring for their turn.Immediately after school, I ran home and excitedly relayed my microscopicadventure to my mother. Using my best second-grade powers of persuasion, Iasked, then begged, then cajoled my mother into getting me a microscope, where Iwould spend hours mesmerized by this alien world that I could access via themiracle of optics.Later, in graduate school, I advanced to an electron microscope. The advantageof an electron microscope over a conventional light microscope is that it is athousand times more powerful. The difference between the two microscopes isanalogous to the difference between the 25¢ observation telescopes used bytourists to observe scenic vistas and the orbiting Hubble telescope thattransmits images of deep space. Entering the electron microscopy suite of alaboratory is a rite of passage for aspiring biologists. You enter through ablack revolving door, similar to the ones separating photographic darkrooms fromilluminated work areas.I remember the first time I stepped into the revolving door and began to turnit. I was in darkness between two worlds, my life as a student and my futurelife as a research scientist. When the door completed its rotation, I wasdeposited into a large, dark chamber, dimly lit by several red photographicsafelights. As my eyes adapted to the available light, I gradually became awedby what stood before me. The red lights were reflecting eerily off the mirroredsurface of a massive, foot-thick chromium steel column of electromagnetic lensesthat rose to the ceiling in the center of the room. Spreading out on either sideat the base of the column was a large control console. The console resembled theinstrument panels of a Boeing 747, filled with switches, illuminated gauges, andmulticolored indicator lamps. Large tentacle-like arrays of thick power cords,water hoses, and vacuum lines radiated from the base of the microscope like taproots at the base of an old oak tree. The sound of clanking vacuum pumps and thewhir of refrigerated water recirculators filled the air. For all I knew, I hadjust emerged on to the command deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Apparently, it wasCaptain Kirk’s day off, for sitting at the console was one of my professors, whowas engaged in the elaborate procedure of introducing a tissue specimen into ahigh-vacuum chamber in the middle of the steel column.While the minutes passed, I experienced a feeling reminiscent of that day insecond grade when I first saw a cell. Finally, a green fluorescent imageappeared on the phosphor screen. The presence of darkly stained cells couldbarely be discerned in the plastic sections, which were enlarged to about thirtytimes their original size. Then the magnification was increased, one step at atime. First 100X, then 1000X, and then 10,000X. When we finally hit warp drive,the cells were magnified to over 100,000 times their original size. It wasindeed Star Trek, but rather than entering outer space, we were going deep intoinner space where “no man has gone before.” One moment I was observing aminiature cell, and seconds later I was flying deep into its moleculararchitecture.My awe at being at the edge of this scientific frontier was palpable. So was myexcitement when I was made honorary co-pilot. I put my hands on the controls sothat I could “fly” over this alien cellular landscape. My professor was my tourguide, pointing out notable land-marks: “Here’s a mitochondrion, there’s theGolgi body, over there is a nuclear pore, this is a collagen molecule, that’s aribosome.”Most of the rush I experienced came from my vision of myself as a pioneer,traversing territory that had never been seen by human eyes. While the lightmicroscope gave me an awareness of cells as sentient creatures, it was theelectron microscope that brought me face to face with the molecules that werethe very foundation of life itself. I knew that buried within thecytoarchitecture of the cell were clues that would provide insight into themysteries of life.For a brief moment, the microscope’s portholes became a crystal ball; in theeerie green glow of its fluorescent screen I saw my future. I knew I was goingto be a cellular biologist whose research would focus on scrutinizing everynuance of the cell’s ultrastructure to gain insights into the secrets ofcellular life. As I had learned early on in graduate school, the structure andfunction of biological organisms are intimately intertwined. By correlating thecell’s microscopic anatomy with its behavior, I was sure to gain insight intothe nature of Nature. Throughout graduate school, postdoctoral research, andinto my career as a medical school professor, my waking hours were consumed byexplorations into the cell’s molecular anatomy. For locked within the cell’sstructure were the secrets of its functions.My exploration of the “secrets of life” led me into a research career studyingthe character of cloned human cells grown in tissue culture. Ten years after myfirst close encounter with an electron microscope, I was a tenured facultymember at the prestigious University of Wisconsin School of Medicine,internationally recognized for my research on cloned stem cells, and honored formy teaching skills. I had graduated to more powerful electron microscopes thatallowed me to take three-dimensional CAT scan–like rides through organisms whereI came face to face with the molecules that are the very foundation of lifeitself. Though my tools were more sophisticated, my approach hadn’t changed. Ihad never lost my seven-year-old conviction that the lives of the cells Istudied had purpose.Unfortunately, I had no such conviction that my own life had a purpose. I didn’tbelieve in God, though I confess that on occasion I entertained the notion of aGod who ruled with an extremely honed perverse sense of humor. I was after all atraditional biologist for whom God’s existence is an unnecessary question: lifeis the consequence of blind chance, the flip of a friendly card, or, to be moreprecise, the random shake of genetic dice. The motto of our profession since thetime of Charles Darwin, has been: “God? We don’t need no steenking God!”It’s not that Darwin denied the existence of God. He simply implied that chance,not Divine intervention, was responsible for the character of life on Earth. Inhis 1859 book, The Origin of Species, Darwin said that individual traits arepassed from parents to their children. He suggested that “hereditary factors”passed from parent to child control the characteristics of an individual’s life.That bit of insight set scientists off on a frenzied attempt to dissect lifedown to its molecular nuts and bolts, for within the structure of the cell wasto be found the heredity mechanism that controlled life.The search came to a remarkable end fifty years ago when James Watson andFrancis Crick described the structure and function of the DNA double helix, thematerial of which genes are made. Scientists finally figured out the nature ofthe “hereditary factors” that Darwin had written about in the 19th century. Thetabloids heralded the brave new world of genetic engineering with its promise ofdesigner babies and magic bullet medical treatments. I vividly remember thelarge block print headlines that filled the front page on that memorable day in1953: “Secret of Life Discovered.”Like the tabloids, biologists jumped on the gene bandwagon. The mechanism bywhich DNA controls biological life became the Central Dogma of molecularbiology, painstakingly spelled out in textbooks. In the long-running debate overnature vs. nurture, the pendulum swung decidedly to nature. At first DNA wasthought to be responsible only for our physical characteristics, but then westarted believing that our genes control our emotions and behaviors as well. Soif you are born with a defective happiness gene, you can expect to have anunhappy life.Unfortunately, I thought I was one of those people victimized by a missing ormutant happiness gene. I was reeling from a relentless barrage of debilitatingemotional roundhouse punches. My father had just died after a long, pain-fraughtbattle with cancer. I was his principal caretaker and had spent the previousfour months flying back and forth between my job in Wisconsin and his home inNew York every three or four days. In between stays at his deathbed, I wastrying to maintain a research program, teach, and write a major grant renewalfor the National Institutes of Health.To further compound my stress levels, I was in the midst of an emotionallydraining and economically devastating divorce. My financial resources wererapidly depleted as I tried to feed and clothe my new dependents, the judicialsystem. Economically challenged and homeless, I found myself living pretty muchout of a suitcase in a most abysmal “garden” apartment complex. Most of myneighbors were hoping to “upgrade” their living standards by seekingaccommodations in trailer parks. I was particularly scared of my next-doorneighbors. My apartment was broken into, and my new stereo system was stolen inmy first week of residence. A week later, six-foot tall, three-foot wide Bubbaknocked on my door. Holding a quart of beer in one hand and picking his teethwith a ten-penny nail held in the other, Bubba wanted to know if I had thedirections for the tape deck.The nadir was the day I threw the phone through the glass door of my office,shattering the “Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Anatomy, U.W.School of Medicine” sign, all the while screaming, “Get me out of here!” Mymeltdown was precipitated by a phone call from a banker, who politely but firmlytold me he couldn’t approve my mortgage application. It was like the scene fromTerms of Endearment when Debra Winger aptly responds to her husband’s hopes fortenure: “We don’t have enough money to pay the bills now. All tenure means is wewon’t have enough money forever!”The Magic of Cells—Déjà VuLuckily, I found an escape in the form of a short-term sabbatical at a medicalschool in the Caribbean. I knew all my problems would not disappear there, butas the jet broke through the gray cloud cover above Chicago, it felt that way. Ibit the inside of my cheek to prevent the smile on my face from evolving intoaudible laughter. I felt as joyful as my seven-year-old self, first discoveringmy life’s passion, the magic of cells.My mood lifted even more on the six-passenger commuter plane that took me toMontserrat, a mere four-by-twelve-mile dot in the Caribbean Sea. If there everwas a Garden of Eden, it probably would have resembled my new island home,erupting out of the sparkling aquamarine sea like a giant multifaceted emerald.When we landed, the gardenia-laced balmy breezes that swept the airport’s tarmacwere intoxicating.The native custom was to dedicate the sunset period as a time of quietcontemplation, a custom I readily adopted. As each day wound down, I lookedforward to the heavenly light show. My house, situated on a cliff fifty feetabove the ocean, faced due west. A winding path through a tree-covered ferngrotto led me down to the water. At the bottom of the grotto, an opening througha wall of jasmine bushes revealed a secluded beach, where I enhanced the sunsetritual by washing away the day with a few “laps” in the warm, gin-clear water.After my swim, I would mold the beach sand into a comfortable recliner, sitback, and watch the sun set slowly into the sea.On that remote island, I was out of the rat race and free to see the worldwithout the blinders of civilization’s dogmatic beliefs. At first my mind wasconstantly reviewing and critiquing the debacle that was my life. But soon mymental Siskel and Ebert ceased their thumbs up/thumbs down review of my fortyyears. I began to re-experience what it was like to live in the moment and forthe moment. To became reacquainted with sensations last experienced as acarefree child. To again feel the pleasure of being alive.I became more human and more humane while living in that island paradise. I alsobecame a better cell biologist. Almost all of my formal scientific training wasin sterile, lifeless classrooms, lecture halls, and laboratories. However, onceI was immersed in the Caribbean’s rich ecosystem, I began to appreciate biologyas a living, breathing, integrated system rather than a collection of individualspecies sharing a piece of the earth’s turf.Sitting quietly within garden-like island jungles and snorkeling among thejeweled coral reefs gave me a window into the island’s amazing integration ofplant and animal species. All live in a delicate, dynamic balance, not only withother life forms but with the physical environment as well. It was life’sharmony—not life’s struggle—that sang out to me as I sat in the Caribbean Gardenof Eden. I became convinced that contemporary biology pays too little attentionto the important role of cooperation because its Darwinian roots emphasizelife’s competitive nature.To the chagrin of my U.S. faculty colleagues, I returned to Wisconsin ascreaming radical bent on challenging the sacred foundational beliefs ofbiology. I even began to openly criticize Charles Darwin and the wisdom of histheory of evolution. In the eyes of most other biologists, my behavior wastantamount to a priest bursting into the Vatican and claiming the Pope was afraud.My colleagues could be forgiven for thinking a coconut had hit me on the headwhen I quit my tenured position and, fulfilling my life’s dream to be in a rock‘n’ roll band, took off on a music tour. I discovered Yanni, who eventuallybecame a big celebrity, and produced a laser show with him. But it soon becameclear that I had a lot more aptitude for teaching and research than I did forproducing rock ‘n’ roll shows. I wound down my midlife crisis, which I’lldescribe in more agonizing detail in a later chapter, by giving up the musicbusiness and returning to the Caribbean to teach cell biology again.My final stop in conventional academia was at Stanford University’s School ofMedicine. By that time I was an unabashed proponent of a “new” biology. I hadcome to question not only Darwin’s dog-eat-dog version of evolution but alsobiology’s Central Dogma, the premise that genes control life. That scientificpremise has one major flaw—genes cannot turn themselves on or off. In morescientific terms, genes are not “self-emergent.” Something in the environmenthas to trigger gene activity. Though that fact had already been established byfrontier science, conventional scientists blinded by genetic dogma had simplyignored it. My outspoken challenge of the Central Dogma turned me into even moreof a scientific heretic. Not only was I a candidate for excommunication, I wasnow suitable for burning at the stake!In a lecture during my interview at Stanford, I found myself accusing thegathered faculty, many of them internationally recognized geneticists, of beingno better than religious fundamentalists for adhering to the Central Dogmadespite evidence to the contrary. After my sacrilegious comments, the lectureroom erupted into shouts of outrage that I thought meant the end of my jobapplication. Instead, my insights concerning the mechanics of a new biologyproved to be provocative enough to get me hired. With the support of someeminent scientists at Stanford, especially from the Pathology Department’schairman, Dr. Klaus Bensch, I was encouraged to pursue my ideas and apply themto research on cloned human cells. To the surprise of those around me, theexperiments fully supported the alternative view of biology that I waspostulating. I published two papers based on this research and left academia,this time for good. (Lipton, et al, 1991, 1992) I left because, despite thesupport I got at Stanford, I felt that my message was falling on deaf ears.Since my departure, new research has consistently validated my skepticism aboutthe Central Dogma and the primacy of DNA in controlling life. In fact,epigenetics, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which environment controlsgene activity, is today one of the most active areas of scientific research. Thenewly emphasized role of the environment in regulating gene activity was thefocus of my cell research twenty-five years ago, long before the field ofepigenetics was even established. (Lipton 1977a, 1977b) While that is gratifyingfor me intellectually, I know that if I were teaching and researching in amedical school, my colleagues would still be wondering about those coconutsbecause in the last decade I have become even more of a radical by academia’sstandards. My preoccupation with a new biology has become more than anintellectual exercise. I believe that cells teach us not only about themechanisms of life, but also teach us how to live rich, full lives.In ivory tower science, that kind of thinking would no doubt win me the wackyDr. Dolittle award for anthropomorphism or more preciselycytopomorphism—thinking like a cell, but for me it is Biology 101. You mayconsider yourself an individual, but as a cell biologist, I can tell you thatyou are in truth a cooperative community of approximately fifty trillionsingle-celled citizens. Almost all of the cells that make up your body areamoeba-like, individual organisms that have evolved a cooperative strategy fortheir mutual survival. Reduced to basic terms, human beings are simply theconsequence of “collective amoebic consciousness.” As a nation reflects thetraits of its citizens, our human-ness must reflect the basic nature of ourcellular communities.Living the Lessons of CellsUsing these cell communities as role models, I came to the conclusion that weare not victims of our genes, but masters of our fates, able to create livesoverflowing with peace, happiness, and love. I tested my hypothesis in my ownlife after a nudge from my audiences, who asked me why my insights hadn’t mademe any happier. They were right: I needed to integrate my new biologicalawareness into my daily life. I knew I had succeeded when, on a bright Sundaymorning in the Big Easy, a coffee-shop waitress asked me: “Honey, you are thehappiest person I ever did see. Tell me child, why are you so happy?” I wastaken aback by her question, but nevertheless I blurted out, “I’m in Heaven!”The waitress shook her head from side to side mumbling, “My, my,” and thenproceeded to take my breakfast order. Well, it was true. I was happy, happierthan I had ever been in my life.A number of you critical readers may rightly be skeptical of my claim that Earthis Heaven. For by definition, Heaven is also the abode of the Deity and theblessed dead. Did I really think that New Orleans, or any other major city,could be part of Heaven? Ragged homeless women and children living in alleys;air so thick that one would never know if stars really existed; rivers and lakesso polluted that only unimaginable “scary” life forms could exist in them. ThisEarth is Heaven? The Deity lives here? He knows the Deity?The answers to those questions are: yes, yes, and I believe I do. Well, to becompletely honest, I must admit that I don’t know all of the Deity personally,for I don’t know all of you. For God’s sake there are over six billion of YOU.And to be more fully honest, I don’t really know all of the members of the plantand animal kingdom either, though I believe they also comprise God.In the immortal words of Tool Time’s Tim Taylor: “Baaaaack the truck up! Is hesaying that humans are God?”Well … yes I am. Of course I am not the first to have said that. It is writtenin Genesis that we are made in the image of God. Yes, this card-carryingrationalist is now quoting Jesus, Buddha, and Rumi. I have come full circle froma reductionist, scientific take on life to a spiritual one. We are made in theimage of God, and we need to put Spirit back into the equation when we want toimprove our physical and our mental health.Because we are not powerless biochemical machines, popping a pill every time weare mentally or physically out of tune is not the answer. Drugs and surgery arepowerful tools when they are not overused, but the notion of simple drug fixesis fundamentally flawed. Every time a drug is introduced into the body tocorrect function A, it inevitably throws off function B, C, or D. It is notgene-directed hormones and neurotransmitters that control our bodies and ourminds; our beliefs control our bodies, our minds, and thus our lives … Oh ye oflittle belief!The Light Outside of the BoxIn this book I will draw the proverbial line in the sand. On one side of theline is a world defined by neo-Darwinism, which casts life as an unending waramong battling, biochemical robots. On the other side of the line is the “NewBiology,” which casts life as a cooperative journey among powerful individualswho can program themselves to create joy-filled lives. When we cross that lineand truly understand the New Biology, we will no longer fractiously debate therole of nurture and nature because we will realize that the fully conscious mindtrumps both nature and nurture. And I believe we will also experience asprofound a paradigmatic change to humanity as when a round-world reality wasintroduced to a flat-world civilization.Humanities’ majors, who may be worried that this book offers an incomprehensiblescience lecture, have no fear. When I was an academic, I chafed at thethree-piece, itchy suit, the constricting tie, the wing-tip shoes, and theinterminable meetings, but I loved to teach. And in my post-academia life, I’vegotten plenty of teaching practice; I have presented the principles of the NewBiology to thousands of people all around the world. Through those lectures, Ihave honed my presentation of the science into easy-to-understand Englishillustrated by colorful charts, many of which are replicated in this book.In Chapter 1, I discuss “smart” cells and why and how they can teach us so muchabout our own minds and bodies. In Chapter 2, I lay out the scientific evidenceto show you that genes do not control biology. I also introduce you to theexciting discoveries of epigenetics, a new field of biology that is unravelingthe mysteries of how the environment (nature) influences the behavior of cellswithout changing the genetic code. It is a field that is uncovering newcomplexities in the nature of disease, including cancer and schizophrenia.Chapter 3 is about the cell’s membrane, the “skin” of the cell. You no doubthave heard more about the DNA-containing nucleus of the cell than you have aboutits membrane. But frontier science is revealing in ever greater detail what Iconcluded over twenty years ago, that the membrane is the true brain of thecellular operation. In Chapter 4, I talk about the mind-bending discoveries ofquantum physics. Those discoveries have profound implications for understandingand treating disease. However, the conventional medical establishment has notyet incorporated quantum physics into its research or medical school training,with tragic results.In Chapter 5, I explain why I named this book The Biology of Belief. Positivethoughts have a profound effect on behavior and genes but only when they are inharmony with subconscious programming. And negative thoughts have an equallypowerful effect. When we recognize how these positive and negative beliefscontrol our biology, we can use this knowledge to create lives filled withhealth and happiness. Chapter 6 reveals why cells and people need to grow andhow fear shuts down that growth.Chapter 7 focuses upon conscious parenting. As parents we need to understand therole we play in programming our children’s beliefs and the impact those beliefshave on our children’s lives. This chapter is important whether you are a parentor not for, as a “former” child, the insight into our programming and its impactupon our lives is quite revealing. In the Epilogue, I review how myunderstanding of the New Biology led me to realize the importance of integratingthe realms of Spirit and Science, which was a radical shift from my backgroundas an agnostic scientist.Are you ready to use your conscious mind to create a life overflowing withhealth, happiness, and love without the aid of genetic engineers and withoutaddicting yourself to drugs? Are you ready to consider an alternate reality tothat provided by the medical model of the human body as a biochemical machine?There is nothing to buy, and there are no policies to take out. It is just amatter of temporarily suspending the archaic beliefs you have acquired from thescientific and media establishments so that you can consider the exciting newawareness offered by leading-edge science."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3081]-1743750592 [images/9781401923112_0030_002.jpg]LESONS FROM THE PETRI DISH:In Praise of Smart Cells and Smart StudentsOn my second day in the Caribbean, as I stood in front of more than a hundredvisibly on-edge medical students, I suddenly realized that not everyone viewedthe island as a laid-back refuge. For these nervous students, Montserrat was nota peaceful escape but a last-ditch chance to realize their dreams of becomingdoctors.My class was geographically homogeneous, mostly American students from the EastCoast, but there were all races and ages, including a sixty-seven-year-oldretiree who was anxious to do more with his life. Their backgrounds were equallyvaried—former elementary school teachers, accountants, musicians, a nun, andeven a drug smuggler.Despite all the differences, the students shared two characteristics: One, theyhad failed to succeed in the highly competitive selection process that filledthe limited number of positions in American medical schools. Two, they were“strivers” intent on becoming doctors—they were not about to be denied theopportunity to prove their qualifications. Most had spent their life savings orindentured themselves to cover the tuition and extra costs of living out of thecountry. Many found themselves completely alone for the first time in theirlives, having left their families, friends, and loved ones behind. They put upwith the most intolerable living conditions on that campus. Yet with all thedrawbacks and the odds stacked against them, they were never deterred from theirquest for a medical degree.Well, at least that was true up to the time of our first class together. Priorto my arrival, the students had had three different histology/cell biologyprofessors. The first lecturer left the students in the lurch when he respondedto some personal issue by bolting from the island three weeks into the semester.In short order, the school found a suitable replacement who tried to pick up thepieces; unfortunately he bailed three weeks later because he got sick. For thepreceding two weeks, a faculty member, responsible for another field of study,had been reading chapters out of a textbook to the class. This obviously boredthe students to death, but the school was fulfilling a directive to provide aspecified number of lecture hours for the course. Academic prerequisites set byAmerican medical examiners have to be met in order for the school’s graduates topractice in the States.For the fourth time that semester, the weary students listened to a newprofessor. I briefed them on my background and my expectations for the course. Imade it clear that even though we were in a foreign country, I was not going toexpect any less from them than what was expected from my Wisconsin students. Norshould they want me to because to be certified all doctors have to pass the sameMedical Boards, no matter where they go to medical school. Then I pulled a sheafof exams out of my briefcase and told the students that I was giving them aself-assessment quiz. The middle of the semester had just passed, and I expectedthem to be familiar with half of the required course material. The test I handedout on that first day of the course consisted of twenty questions taken directlyfrom the University of Wisconsin histology midterm exam.The classroom was deadly silent for the first ten minutes of the testing period.Then nervous fidgeting felled the students one by one, faster than the spread ofthe deadly Ebola virus. By the time the twenty minutes allotted for the quizwere over, wide-eyed panic had gripped the class. When I said, “Stop,” thepent-up nervous anxiety erupted into the din of a hundred excited conversations.I quieted the class down and began to read them the answers. The first five orsix answers were met with subdued sighs. After I reached the tenth question,each subsequent answer was followed by agonizing groans. The highest score inthe class was ten correct answers, followed by several students who answeredseven correctly; with guesswork, most of the rest scored at least one or twocorrect answers.When I looked up at the class, I was greeted with frozen, shell-shocked faces.The “strivers” found themselves behind the big eight ball. With more than half asemester behind them, they had to start the course all over again. A dark gloomovercame the students, most of whom were already treading water in their other,very demanding medical school courses. Within moments, their gloom had turnedinto quiet despair. In profound silence, I looked out over the students and theylooked back at me. I experienced an internal ache—the class collectivelyresembled one of those Greenpeace pictures of wide-eyed baby seals just beforeheartless fur traders club them to death.My heart welled. Perhaps the salt air and sweet scents had already made me moremagnanimous. In any case, unexpectedly, I found myself announcing that I wouldmake it my personal commitment to see that every student was fully prepared forthe final exam, if they would commit to providing matching efforts. When theyrealized I was truly committed to their success, I could see the lights flash onin their previously panicked eyes.Feeling like an embattled coach revving up the team for the Big Game, I toldthem I thought they were every bit as intelligent as the students I taught inthe States. I told them I believed their State-side peers were simply moreproficient at rote memorization, the quality that enabled them to score betterin the medical college admissions tests. I also tried very hard to convince themthat histology and cell biology are not intellectually difficult courses. Iexplained that in all of its elegance, nature employs very simple operatingprinciples. Rather than just memorizing facts and figures, I promised they weregoing to gain an understanding of cells because I would present simpleprinciples on top of simple principles. I offered to provide additional nightlectures, which would tax their stamina after their already long lecture- andlab-packed days. The students were pumped up after my ten-minute pep talk. Whenthe period ended, they bolted from that classroom snorting fire, determined theywould not be beaten by the system.After the students left, the enormity of the commitment I had made sank in. Istarted having doubts. I knew that a significant number of the students weretruly unqualified to be attending medical school. Many others were capablestudents whose backgrounds had not prepared them for the challenge. I was afraidthat my island idyll would degenerate into a frenetic, time-consuming academicscrimmage that would end in failure for my students and for me as their teacher.I started thinking about my job at Wisconsin, and suddenly it was beginning tolook easy. At Wisconsin, I gave only eight lectures out of the approximatelyfifty that made up the histology/cell biology course. There were five members ofthe anatomy department who shared the lecturing load. Of course I wasresponsible for the material in all of the lectures because I was involved intheir accompanying laboratory sessions. I was supposed to be available to answerall course-related questions asked by the students. But knowing the material andpresenting lectures on the material are not the same thing!I had a three-day weekend to wrestle with the situation I had created formyself. Had I faced a crisis such as this back home, my type A personality wouldhave had me swinging from the proverbial chandeliers. Interestingly, as I sat bythe pool, watching the sun set into the Caribbean, the potential angst simplymorphed into an exciting adventure. I began to get excited about the fact thatfor the first time in my teaching career, I was solely responsible for thismajor course and free from having to conform to the style and contentrestrictions of team-taught programs.Cells as Miniature HumansAs it turned out, that histology course was the most exhilarating andintellectually profound period of my academic career. Free to teach the coursethe way I wanted to teach it, I ventured into a new way of covering thematerial, an approach that had been roiling in my brain for several years. I hadbeen fascinated by the idea that considering cells as “miniature humans” wouldmake it easier to understand their physiology and behavior. As I contemplated anew structure for the course, I got excited. The idea of overlapping cell andhuman biology rekindled the inspiration for science I had felt as a child. Istill experienced that enthusiasm in my research laboratory, though not when Iwas mired in the administrative details of being a tenured faculty member,including endless meetings and what, for me, were tortuous faculty parties.I was prone to thinking of cells as human-like because, after years behind amicroscope, I had become humbled by the complexity and power of what at firstappear to be anatomically simple, moving blobs in a Petri dish. In school youmay have learned the basic components of a cell: the nucleus that containsgenetic material, the energy-producing mitochondria, the protective membrane atthe outside rim, and the cytoplasm in between. But within these anatomicallysimple-looking cells is a complex world; these smart cells employ technologiesthat scientists have yet to fully fathom.The notion of cells as miniature humans that I was mulling over would beconsidered heresy by most biologists. Trying to explain the nature of anythingnot human by relating it to human behavior is called anthropomorphism. “True”scientists consider anthropomorphism to be something of a mortal sin andostracize scientists who knowingly employ it in their work.However, I believed that I was breaking out of orthodoxy for a good reason.Biologists try to gain scientific understanding by observing nature andconjuring up a hypothesis of how things work. Then they design experiments totest their ideas. By necessity, deriving the hypothesis and designing theexperiments require the scientist to “think” how a cell or another livingorganism carries out its life. Applying these “human” solutions, i.e. a humanview of resolving biology’s mysteries, automatically makes these scientistsguilty of anthropomorphizing. No matter how you cut it, biological science isbased to some degree on humanizing the subject matter.Actually, I believe that the unwritten ban on anthropomorphism is an outmodedremnant of the Dark Ages when religious authorities denied any directrelationship existed between humans and any of God’s other creations. While Ican see the value of the concept when people try to anthropomorphize a lightbulb, a radio, or a pocketknife, I do not see it as a valid criticism when it isapplied to living organisms. Human beings are multicellular organisms—we mustinherently share basic behavioral patterns with our own cells.However, I know that it takes a shift in perception to acknowledge thatparallel. Historically, our Judeo-Christian beliefs have led us to think that weare the intelligent creatures who were created in a separate and distinctprocess from all other plants and animals. This view has us looking down ournoses at lesser creatures as nonintelligent life forms, especially thoseorganisms on the lower evolutionary rungs of life.Nothing could be further from the truth. When we observe other humans asindividual entities or see ourselves in the mirror as an individual organism, inone sense, we are correct, at least from the perspective of our level ofobservation. However, if I brought you down to the size of an individual cell soyou could see your body from that perspective, it would offer a whole new viewof the world. When you looked back at yourself from that perspective you wouldnot see yourself as a single entity. You would see yourself as a bustlingcommunity of more than fifty trillion individual cells.As I toyed with these ideas for my histology class, the picture that keptrecurring in my mind was a chart from an encyclopedia I had used as a child.Under the section on humans, there was an illustration with seven transparentplastic pages, each printed with an identical, overlapping outline of the humanbody. On the first page the outline was filled in with an image of a naked man.Turning the first page was like peeling off his skin and revealing hismusculature, the image within the outline on the second page. When I turned thesecond page, the overlapping images of the remaining pages revealed a vividdissection of the body. Flipping through the pages I could see in turn, theskeleton, the brain and nerves, blood vessels, and organ systems.For my Caribbean course, I mentally updated those transparencies with severaladditional, overlapping pages, each illustrated with cellular structures. Mostof the cell’s structures are referred to as organelles, which are its “miniatureorgans” suspended within a jellylike cytoplasm. Organelles are the functionalequivalents of the tissues and organs of our own bodies. They include thenucleus, which is the largest organelle, the mitochondria, the Golgi body, andvacuoles. The traditional way of teaching the course is to deal first with thesecellular structures, then move on to the tissues and organs of the human body.Instead, I integrated the two parts of the course to reflect the overlappingnature of humans and cells.I taught my students that the biochemical mechanisms employed by cellularorganelle systems are essentially the same mechanisms employed by our humanorgan systems. Even though humans are made up of trillions of cells, I stressedthat there is not one “new” function in our bodies that is not already expressedin the single cell. Each eukaryote (nucleus-containing cell) possesses thefunctional equivalent of our nervous system, digestive system, respiratorysystem, excretory system, endocrine system, muscle and skeletal systems,circulatory system, integument (skin), reproductive system, and even a primitiveimmune system, which utilizes a family of antibody-like “ubiquitin” proteins.I also made it clear to my students that each cell is an intelligent being thatcan survive on its own, as scientists demonstrate when they remove individualcells from the body and grow them in a culture. As I knew intuitively when I wasa child, these smart cells are imbued with intent and purpose; they activelyseek environments that support their survival while simultaneously avoidingtoxic or hostile ones. Like humans, single cells analyze thousands of stimulifrom the microenvironment they inhabit. Through the analysis of this data, cellsselect appropriate behavioral responses to ensure their survival.Single cells are also capable of learning through these environmentalexperiences and are able to create cellular memories, which they pass on totheir offspring. For example, when a measles virus infects a child, an immatureimmune cell is called in to create a protective protein antibody against thatvirus. In the process, the cell must create a new gene to serve as a blueprintin manufacturing the measles antibody protein.The first step in generating a specific measles antibody gene occurs in thenuclei of immature immune cells. Among their genes are a very large number ofDNA segments that encode uniquely shaped snippets of proteins. By randomlyassembling and recombining these DNA segments, immune cells create a vast arrayof different genes, each one providing for a uniquely shaped antibody protein.When an immature immune cell produces an antibody protein that is a “close”physical complement to the invading measles virus, that cell will be activated.Activated cells employ an amazing mechanism called affinity maturation thatenables the cell to perfectly “adjust” the final shape of its antibody protein,so that it will become a perfect complement to the invading measles virus. (Li,et al, 2003; Adams, et al, 2003) Using a process called somatic hypermutation,activated immune cells make hundreds of copies of their original antibody gene.However, each new version of the gene is slightly mutated so that it will encodea slightly different shaped antibody protein. The cell selects the variant genethat makes the best fitting antibody. This selected version of the gene alsogoes through repeated rounds of somatic hypermutation to further sculpt theshape of the antibody to become a “perfect” physical complement of the measlesvirus. (Wu, et al, 2003; Blanden and Steele 1998; Diaz and Casali 2002; Gearhart2002)When the sculptured antibody locks on to the virus, it inactivates the invaderand marks it for destruction, thus protecting the child from the ravages ofmeasles. The cells retain the genetic “memory” of this antibody, so that in thefuture if the individual is again exposed to measles, the cells can immediatelylaunch a protective immune response. The new antibody gene can also be passed onto all the cell’s progeny when it divides. In this process, not only did thecell “learn” about the measles virus, it also created a “memory” that will beinherited and propagated by its daughter cells. This amazing feat of geneticengineering is profoundly important because it represents an inherent“intelligence” mechanism by which cells evolve. (Steele, et al, 1998)The Origins of Life: Smart Cells Get SmarterIt shouldn’t be surprising that cells are so smart. Single-celled organisms werethe first life forms on this planet. Fossil evidence reveals they were herewithin 600 million years after the Earth was first formed. For the next 2.75billion years of the Earth’s history, only free-living, single-celledorganisms—bacteria, algae, and amoeba-like protozoans—populated the world.Around 750 million years ago, these smart cells figured out how to get smarterwhen the first multicellular organisms (plants and animals) appeared.Multicellular life forms were initially loose communities or “colonies” ofsingle-celled organisms. At first, cellular communities consisted of tens andhundreds of cells. But the evolutionary advantage of living in a community soonled to organizations comprised of millions, billions, and even trillions ofsocially interactive single cells. Though each individual cell is of microscopicdimensions, the size of multicellular communities may range from the barelyvisible to the monolithic. Biologists have classified these organizedcommunities based on their structure as observed by the human eye. While thecellular communities appear as single entities to the naked eye—a mouse, a dog,a human—they are, in fact, highly organized associations of millions andtrillions of cells.The evolutionary push for ever-bigger communities is simply a reflection of thebiological imperative to survive. The more awareness an organism has of itsenvironment, the better its chances for survival. When cells band together theyincrease their awareness exponentially. If each cell were to be arbitrarilyassigned an awareness value of X, then each colonial organism would collectivelyhave a potential awareness value of at least X times the number of cells in thecolony.In order to survive at such high densities, the cells created structuredenvironments. These sophisticated communities subdivided the workload with moreprecision and effectiveness than the ever-changing organizational charts thatare a fact of life in big corporations. It proved more efficient for thecommunity to have individual cells assigned to specialized tasks. In thedevelopment of animals and plants, cells begin to acquire these specializedfunctions in the embryo. A process of cytological specialization enables thecells to form the specific tissues and organs of the body. Over time, thispattern of differentiation, i.e., the distribution of the workload among themembers of the community, became embedded in the genes of every cell in thecommunity, significantly increasing the organism’s efficiency and its ability tosurvive.In larger organisms, for example, only a small percentage of cells are concernedwith reading and responding to environmental stimuli. That is the role of groupsof specialized cells that form the tissues and organs of the nervous system. Thefunction of the nervous system is to perceive the environment and coordinate thebehavior of all the other cells in the vast cellular community.Division of labor among the cells in the community offered an additionalsurvival advantage. The efficiency it offered enabled more cells to live onless. Consider the old adage: “Two can live as cheaply as one.” Or consider theconstruction costs of building a two-bedroom single home versus the cost ofbuilding a two-bedroom apartment in a hundred-apartment complex. To survive,each cell is required to expend a certain amount of energy. The amount of energyconserved by individuals living in a community contributes to both an increasedsurvival advantage and a better quality of life.In American capitalism, Henry Ford saw the tactical advantage in thedifferentiated form of communal effort and employed it in creating his assemblyline system of manufacturing cars. Before Ford, a small team of multiskilledworkers would require a week or two to build a single automobile. Ford organizedhis shop so that every worker was responsible for only one specialized job. Hestationed a large number of these differentiated workers along a single row, theassembly line, and passed the developing car from one specialist to the next.The efficiency of job specialization enabled Ford to produce a new automobile inninety minutes rather than weeks.Unfortunately, we conveniently “forgot” about the cooperation necessary forevolution when Charles Darwin emphasized a radically different theory about theemergence of life. He concluded 150 years ago that living organisms areperpetually embroiled in a “struggle for existence.” For Darwin, struggle andviolence are not only a part of animal (human) nature but the principal “forces”behind evolutionary advancement. In the final chapter of The Origin of Species:By Means of Natural Selection, Or, The Preservation Of Favoured Races In TheStruggle For Life, Darwin wrote of an inevitable “struggle for life” and thatevolution was driven by “the war of nature, from famine and death.” Couple thatwith Darwin’s notion that evolution is random and you have a world, aspoetically described by Tennyson, that can be characterized as “red in tooth andclaw,” a series of meaningless, bloody battles for survival.Evolution Without the Bloody ClawsThough Darwin is by far the most famous evolutionist, the first scientist toestablish evolution as a scientific fact was the distinguished French biologistJean-Baptiste de Lamarck. (Lamarck 1809, 1914, 1963) Even Ernst Mayr, theleading architect of “neo Darwinism,” a modernization of Darwin’s theory thatincorporates twentieth-century molecular genetics, concedes that Lamarck was thepioneer. In his classic 1970 book, Evolution and the Diversity of Life, (Mayr1976, page 227) Mayr wrote: “It seems to me Lamarck has a much better claim tobe designated the ‘founder of the theory of evolution,’ as indeed he has byseveral French historians … he was the first author to devote an entire bookprimarily to the presentation of a theory of organic evolution. He was the firstto present the entire system of animals as a product of evolution.”Not only did Lamarck present his theory fifty years before Darwin, he offered amuch less harsh theory of the mechanisms of evolution. Lamarck’s theorysuggested that evolution was based on an “instructive,” cooperative interactionamong organisms and their environment that enables life forms to survive andevolve in a dynamic world. His notion was that organisms acquire and pass onadaptations necessary for their survival in a changing environment.Interestingly, Lamarck’s hypothesis about the mechanisms of evolution conform tomodern cell biologists’ understanding of how immune systems adapt to theirenvironment as described above.Lamarck’s theory was an early target of the Church. The notion that humansevolved from lower life forms was denounced as heresy. Lamarck was also scornedby his fellow scientists who, as creationists, ridiculed his theories. A Germandevelopmental biologist, August Weismann, helped propel Lamarck into obscuritywhen he tried to test Lamarck’s theory that organisms pass on survival-orientedtraits acquired through their interaction with the environment. In one ofWeismann’s experiments, he cut off the tails of male and female mice and matedthem. Weismann argued that if Lamarck’s theory were correct, the parents shouldpass on their tail-less state to future generations. The first generation ofmice was born with tails. Weismann repeated the experiment for 21 moregenerations, but not one tail-less mouse was born, leading Weismann to concludethat Lamarck’s notion of inheritance was wrong.But Weismann’s experiment was not a true test of Lamarck’s theory. Lamarcksuggested that such evolutionary changes could take “immense periods of time,”according to biographer L. J. Jor-danova. In 1984, Jordanova wrote thatLamarck’s theory “rested on” a number of “propositions” including “the lawsgoverning living things have produced increasingly complex forms over immenseperiods of time.” (Jordanova 1984, page 71) Weismann’s five-year experiment wasclearly not long enough to test the theory. An even more fundamental flaw in hisexperiment is that Lamarck never argued that every change an organismexperienced would take hold. Lamarck said organisms hang on to traits (liketails) when they need them to survive. Although Weismann didn’t think the miceneeded their tails, no one asked the mice if they thought their tails werenecessary for survival!Despite its obvious flaws, the study of the tail-less mice helped destroyLamarck’s reputation. In fact, Lamarck has been mostly ignored or vilified.Cornell University evolutionist C.H. Wadding-ton wrote in The Evolution of AnEvolutionist (Waddington 1975, page 38): “Lamarck is the only major figure inthe history of biology whose name has become to all intents and purposes, a termof abuse. Most scientists’ contributions are fated to be outgrown, but very fewauthors have written works, which, two centuries later, are still rejected withindignation so intense that the skeptic may suspect something akin to an uneasyconscience. In point of fact, Lamarck has, I think, been somewhat unfairlyjudged.”Waddington wrote those prescient words thirty years ago. Today Lamarck’stheories are being reevaluated under the weight of a body of new science thatsuggests that the oft-denounced biologist was not entirely wrong and theoft-lauded Darwin not entirely correct. The title of an article in theprestigious journal Science in 2000 was one sign of glasnost: “Was Lamarck Justa Little Bit Right?” (Balter 2000)One reason some scientists are taking another look at Lamarck is thatevolutionists are reminding us of the invaluable role cooperation plays insustaining life in the biosphere. Scientists have long noted symbioticrelationships in nature. In Darwin’s Blind Spot (Ryan 2002, page 16), Britishphysician Frank Ryan chronicles a number of such relationships, including ayellow shrimp that gathers food while its partner gobi fish protects it frompredators and a species of hermit crab that carries a pink anemone on top of itsshell. “Fish and octopuses like to feed on hermit crabs, but when they approachthis species, the anemone shoots out its brilliantly colored tentacles, withtheir microscopic batteries of poisoned darts, and stings the potentialpredator, encouraging it to look elsewhere for its meal.” The warrior anemonegets something out of the relationship as well because it eats the crab’sleftover food.But today’s understanding of cooperation in nature goes much deeper than theeasily observable relationships. “Biologists are becoming increasingly awarethat animals have coevolved and continue to coexist, with diverse assemblages ofmicroorganisms that are required for normal health and development,” accordingto a recent article in Science called “We Get By With A Little Help from Our(Little) Friends.” (Ruby, et al, 2004) The study of these relationships is now arapidly growing field called “Systems Biology.”Ironically, in recent decades, we have been taught to wage war againstmicroorganisms with everything from antibacterial soap to antibiotics. But thatsimplistic message ignores the fact that many bacteria are essential to ourhealth. The classic example of how humans get help from microorganisms is thebacteria in our digestive system, which are essential to our survival. Thebacteria in our stomach and intestinal tract help digest food and also enablethe absorption of life-sustaining vitamins. This microbe-human cooperation isthe reason that the rampant use of antibiotics is detrimental to our survival.Antibiotics are indiscriminate killers; they kill bacteria that are required forour survival as efficiently as they kill harmful bacteria.Recent advances in genome science have revealed an additional mechanism ofcooperation among species. Living organisms, it turns out, actually integratetheir cellular communities by sharing their genes. It had been thought thatgenes are passed on only to the progeny of an individual organism throughreproduction. Now scientists realize that genes are shared not only among theindividual members of a species but also among members of different species. Thesharing of genetic information via gene transfer speeds up evolution sinceorganisms can acquire “learned” experiences from other organisms. (Nitz, et al,2004; Pennisi 2004; Boucher, et al, 2003; Dutta and Pan 2002; Gogarten 2003)Given this sharing of genes, organisms can no longer be seen as disconnectedentities; there is no wall between species. Daniel Drell, manager of theDepartment of Energy’s microbial genome program told Science (2001 294:1634) “wecan no longer comfortably say what is a species anymore.” (Pennisi 2001)This sharing of information is not an accident. It is nature’s method ofenhancing the survival of the biosphere. As discussed earlier, genes arephysical memories of an organism’s learned experiences. The recently recognizedexchange of genes among individuals disperses those memories, therebyinfluencing the survival of all organisms that make up the community of life.Now that we are aware of this inter- and intra-species gene transfer mechanism,the dangers of genetic engineering become apparent. For example, tinkering withthe genes of a tomato may not stop at that tomato but could alter the entirebiosphere in ways that we cannot foresee. Already there is a study that showsthat when humans digest genetically modified foods, the artificially createdgenes transfer into and alter the character of the beneficial bacteria in theintestine. (Heritage 2004; Netherwood, et al, 2004) Similarly, gene transferamong genetically engineered agricultural crops and surrounding native specieshas given rise to highly resistant species deemed superweeds. (Milius 2003;Haygood, et al, 2003; Desplanque, et al, 2002; Spencer and Snow 2001) Geneticengineers have never taken the reality of gene transfer into consideration whenthey have introduced genetically modified organisms into the environment. We arenow beginning to experience the dire consequences of this oversight as theirengineered genes are spreading among and altering other organisms in theenvironment. (Watrud, et al, 2004)Genetic evolutionists warn that if we fail to apply the lessons of our sharedgenetic destiny, which should be teaching us the importance of cooperation amongall species, we threaten human existence. We need to move beyond DarwinianTheory, which stresses the importance of individuals, to one that stresses theimportance of the community. British scientist Timothy Lenton provides evidencethat evolution is more dependent on the interaction among species than it is onthe interaction of individuals within a species. Evolution becomes a matter ofthe survival of the fittest groups rather than the survival of the fittestindividuals. In a 1998 article in Nature, Lenton wrote that rather than focusingon individuals and their role in evolution “we must consider the totality oforganisms and their material environment to fully understand which traits cometo persist and dominate.” (Lenton 1998)Lenton subscribes to James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis that holds that the Earthand all of its species constitute one interactive, living organism. Those whoendorse this hypothesis argue that tampering with the balance of thesuperorganism called Gaia, whether it be by destroying the rainforest, depletingthe ozone layer, or altering organisms through genetic engineering, can threatenits survival and consequently ours.Recent studies funded by Britain’s Natural Environment Research Council providesupport for those concerns. (Thomas, et al, 2004; Stevens, et al, 2004) Whilethere have been five mass extinctions in the history of our planet, they are allpresumed to have been caused by extraterrestrial events, such as a cometsmashing to earth. One of the new studies concludes that the “natural world isexperiencing the sixth, major extinction event in its history.” (Lovell 2004)This time though, the cause of the extinction is not extraterrestrial. Accordingto one of the study’s authors, Jeremy Thomas, “As far as we can tell this one iscaused by one animal organism—man.”Walking the Talk of CellsIn my years of teaching in medical school, I had come to realize that medicalstudents in an academic setting are more competitive and backbiting than atruckload of lawyers. They live out the Darwinian struggle in their quest to beone of the “fittest” who stagger to graduation after four grueling years inmedical school. The single-minded pursuit of stellar medical school grades,without regard for the students surrounding you, no doubt follows a Darwinianmodel, but it always seemed to me an ironic pursuit for those who are strivingto become compassionate healers.But my stereotypes about medical students toppled during my stay on the island.After my call to arms, my class of misfits stopped acting like conventionalmedical students; they dropped their survival of the fittest mentality andamalgamated into a single force, a team that helped them survive the semester.The stronger students helped the weaker and, in so doing, all became stronger.Their harmony was both surprising and beautiful to observe.In the end, there was a bonus: a happy Hollywood ending. For their final exam, Igave my students exactly the same test the students in Wisconsin had to pass.There was virtually no difference in the performance of these “rejects” andtheir “elitist” counterparts in the States. Many students later reported thatwhen they went home and met with their peers who attended American medicalschools, they proudly found themselves more proficient in their understanding ofthe principles governing the life of cells and organisms.I was of course thrilled that my students had pulled off an academic miracle.But it was years before I understood how they were able to do it. At the time, Ithought the format of the course was key, and I still believe that overlappinghuman and cell biology is a better way to present the course material. But nowthat I’ve ventured into what I told you would be considered by some as wacky Dr.Dolittle territory, I think a good part of the reason for my students’ successwas that they eschewed the behavior of their counterparts in the United States.Instead of mirroring smart American medical students, they mirrored the behaviorof smart cells, banding together to become even smarter. I didn’t tell mystudents to pattern their lives after the lives of the cells, because I wasstill steeped in traditional, scientific training. But I like to think that theywent in that direction intuitively after listening to my praise of cells’ability to group together cooperatively to form more complex and highlysuccessful organisms.I didn’t know it at the time but I now believe that another reason for mystudents’ success was that I did not stop at praising cells. I praised thestudents as well. They needed to hear they were first-rate students in order tobelieve that they could perform as first-rate students. As I will detail infuture chapters, so many of us are leading limited lives not because we have tobut because we think we have to. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Suffice it tosay that after four months in paradise, teaching in a way that clarified mythinking about cells and the lessons they provide to humans, I was well on myway to an understanding of the New Biology, which leaves in the dust thedefeatism of genetic and parental programming as well as survival-of-the-fittestDarwinism."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3261]-1743749942 [images/9781401923112_0048_002.jpg]IT’S THE ENVIRONMENT, STUPIDI will never forget a piece of wisdom I received in 1967, on the first day Ilearned to clone stem cells in graduate school. It took me decades to realizehow profound this seemingly simple piece of wisdom was for my work and my life.My professor, mentor, and consummate scientist Irv Konigsberg was one of thefirst cell biologists to master the art of cloning stem cells. He told me thatwhen the cultured cells you are studying are ailing, you look first to thecell’s environment, not to the cell itself, for the cause.My professor wasn’t as blunt as Bill Clinton’s campaign manager, James Carville,who decreed, “It’s the economy, stupid,” to be the mantra for the 1992presidential election. But cell biologists would have done well to post, “It’sthe environment, stupid,” over our desks, just as the “It’s the economy, stupid”sign was posted at Clinton headquarters. Though it wasn’t apparent at the time,I eventually realized that this advice was a key insight into understanding thenature of life. Over and over I learned the wisdom of Irv’s advice. When Iprovided a healthy environment for my cells, they thrived; when the environmentwas less than optimal, the cells faltered. When I adjusted the environment,these “sick” cells revitalized.But most cell biologists knew nothing of this wisdom of tissue culturetechniques. And scientists moved sharply away from considering environmentalinfluences after Watson and Crick’s revelation of DNA’s genetic code. EvenCharles Darwin conceded, near the end of his life, that his evolutionary theoryhad shortchanged the role of the environment. In an 1876 letter to Moritz Wagnerhe wrote: “In my opinion, the greatest error which I have committed has been notallowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environments, i.e., food,climate, etc., independently of natural selection … When I wrote the Origin, andfor some years afterwards, I could find little good evidence of the directaction of the environment; now there is a large body of evidence.” (Darwin, F1888)Scientists who follow Darwin continue to make the same error. The problem withthis underemphasis on the environment is that it led to an overemphasis on“nature” in the form of genetic determinism—the belief that genes “control”biology. This belief has not only led to a misallocation of research dollars, asI will argue in a later chapter, but, more importantly, it has changed the waywe think about our lives. When you are convinced that genes control your lifeand you know that you had no say in which genes you were saddled with atconception, you have a good excuse to consider yourself a victim of heredity.“Don’t blame me for my work habits—it’s not my fault that I’ve beenprocrastinating on my deadline … It’s genetic!”Since the dawning of the Age of Genetics, we have been programmed to accept thatwe are subservient to the power of our genes. The world is filled with peoplewho live in constant fear that, on some unsuspecting day, their genes are goingto turn on them. Consider the masses of people who think they are ticking timebombs; they wait for cancer to explode in their lives as it exploded in the lifeof their mother or brother or sister or aunt or uncle. Millions of othersattribute their failing health not to a combination of mental, physical,emotional, and spiritual causes but simply to the inadequacies of their body’sbiochemical mechanics. Are your kids unruly? Increasingly the first choice is tomedicate these children to correct their “chemical imbalances” rather than fullygrappling with what is going on in their bodies, minds, and spirits.Of course there is no doubt that some diseases, like Huntington’s chorea, betathalassemia, and cystic fibrosis, can be blamed entirely on one faulty gene. Butsingle-gene disorders affect less than two percent of the population; the vastmajority of people come into this world with genes that should enable them tolive a happy and healthy life. The diseases that are today’s scourges—diabetes,heart disease, and cancer—short circuit a happy and healthy life. Thesediseases, however, are not the result of a single gene, but of complexinteractions among multiple genes and environmental factors.What about all those headlines trumpeting the discovery of a gene for everythingfrom depression to schizophrenia? Read those articles closely and you’ll seethat behind the breathless headline is a more sober truth. Scientists havelinked lots of genes to lots of different diseases and traits, but scientistshave rarely found that one gene causes a trait or a disease.The confusion occurs when the media repeatedly distort the meaning of two words:correlation and causation. It’s one thing to be linked to a disease; it’s quiteanother to cause a disease, which implies a directing, controlling action. If Ishow you my keys and say that a particular key “controls” my car, you at firstmight think that makes sense because you know you need that key to turn on theignition. But does the key actually “control” the car? If it did, you couldn’tleave the key in the car alone because it might just borrow your car for a joyride when you are not paying attention. In truth, the key is “correlated” withthe control of the car; the person who turns the key actually controls the car.Specific genes are correlated with an organism’s behavior and characteristics.But these genes are not activated until something triggers them.What activates genes? The answer was elegantly spelled out in 1990 in a paperentitled Metaphors and the Role of Genes and Development by H. F. Nijhout.(Nijhout 1990) Nijhout presents evidence that the notion that genes controlbiology has been so frequently repeated for such a long period of time thatscientists have forgotten it is a hypothesis, not a truth. In reality, the ideathat genes control biology is a supposition, which has never been proven and, infact, has been undermined by the latest scientific research. Genetic control,argues Nijhout, has become a metaphor in our society. We want to believe thatgenetic engineers are the new medical magicians who can cure diseases and whilethey’re at it create more Einsteins and Mozarts as well. But metaphor does notequate with scientific truth. Nijhout summarizes the truth: “When a gene productis needed, a signal from its environment, not an emergent property of the geneitself, activates expression of that gene.” In other words, when it comes togenetic control, “It’s the environment, stupid.”Protein: The Stuff of LifeIt is easy to understand how genetic control became a metaphor as scientistswith ever-greater excitement zeroed in on the mechanisms of DNA. Organicchemists discovered that cells are made up of four types of very largemolecules: polysaccharides (complex sugars), lipids (fats), nucleic acids(DNA/RNA), and proteins. Though the cell requires each of the four moleculartypes, proteins are the most important single component for living organisms.Our cells are, in the main, an assembly of protein-building blocks. So one wayof looking at our trillion-celled bodies is that they are protein machines,although, as you know, I think we are more than machines! It sounds simple, butit isn’t. For one thing, it takes over 100,000 different types of proteins torun our bodies.Let’s take a closer look at how our cells’ 100,000 plus proteins are assembled.Each protein is a linear string of linked amino acid molecules, comparable to achild’s pop bead necklace, as illustrated below.-1743749718 [images/9781401923112_0051_005.jpg]Each bead represents one of the twenty amino acid molecules used by cells.Though I like the pop bead analogy because everyone is familiar with it, it isnot an exact one because each amino acid has a slightly different shape. So tobe completely accurate, you should think of a pop bead necklace that got mangleda bit in the factory.And to be even more accurate, you should know that the amino acid necklace,which forms the “backbone” of the cells’ proteins, is far more malleable than apop bead necklace, which falls apart when you bend it too much. The structureand behavior of the linked amino acids in the protein backbones better resemblethat of a snake’s backbone, as shown below. (©Warren Jacobi/Corbis) The spine ofa snake, made up of a large number of linked subunits, the vertebrae, is capableof coiling the snake into a wide variety of shapes, ranging from a straight rodto a knotted “ball.”-1743749694 [images/9781401923112_0052_002.jpg]The flexible links (peptide bonds) between amino acids in a protein backboneenable each protein to adopt a variety of shapes. Through the rotation andflexion of their amino acid “vertebrae,” protein molecules resemble nano-snakesin their ability to writhe and squirm. There are two primary factors thatdetermine the contour of a protein’s backbone and therefore its shape. Onefactor is the physical pattern defined by the sequence of differently shapedamino acids comprising the pop bead–like backbone.-1743749674 [images/9781401923112_0053_002.jpg]Unlike uniform-shaped pop beads, each of the twenty amino acids comprisingprotein backbones has a unique shape (conformation). Consider the differencesbetween the character of a “backbone” made from identically shaped pop beads andone assembled from the differently shaped pipe fittings illustrated above.The second factor concerns the interaction of electromagnetic charges among thelinked amino acids. Most amino acids have positive or negative charges, whichact like magnets: like charges cause the molecules to repel one another, whileopposite charges cause the molecules to attract each other. As shown on thefollowing page, a protein’s flexible backbone spontaneously folds into apreferred shape when its amino acid subunits rotate and flex their bonds tobalance the forces generated by their positive and negative charges.-1743749645 [images/9781401923112_0054_001.jpg]The protein backbones shown in A and B have the exact same amino acid (pipefitting) sequence but reveal radically different conformations. Variations inthe backbone’s shape result from differential rotations at the junctions betweenadjacent fittings. Like pipe fittings, the protein’s differently shaped aminoacids also rotate around their junctions (peptide bonds), allowing the backboneto wriggle like a snake. Proteins shape-shift though they will generally prefertwo or three specific conformations. Which of the two conformations, A or B,would our hypothetical protein prefer? The answer is related to the fact thatthe two terminal amino acids (pipe fittings) have regions of negative charges.Since like charges repel each other, the farther apart they are, the more stablethe conformation. Conformation A would be preferred because the negative chargesare farther apart than they are in B.The backbones of some protein molecules are so long that they require theassistance of special “helper” proteins called chaperones to aid in the foldingprocess. Improperly folded proteins, like people with spinal defects, are unableto function optimally. Such aberrant proteins are marked for destruction by thecell; their backbone amino acids are disassembled and recycled in the synthesisof new proteins.How Proteins Create LifeLiving organisms are distinguished from nonliving entities by the fact that theymove; they are animated. The energy driving their movements is harnessed to dothe “work” that characterizes living systems, such as respiration, digestion,and muscle contraction. To understand the nature of life one must firstunderstand how protein “machines” are empowered to move.The final shape, or conformation (the technical term used by biologists), of aprotein molecule reflects a balanced state among its electromagnetic charges.However, if the protein’s positive and negative charges are altered, the proteinbackbone will dynamically twist and adjust itself to accommodate the newdistribution of charges. The distribution of electromagnetic charge within aprotein can be selectively altered by a number of processes including thebinding of other molecules or chemical groups such as hormones; the enzymaticremoval or addition of charged ions; or interference from electromagnetic fieldssuch as those emanating from cell phones. (Tsong 1989)-1743749576 [images/9781401923112_0055_004.jpg]-1743749575 [images/9781401923112_0056_001.jpg]Figure A shows the preferred conformation of our hypothetical protein backboneThe repelling forces between the two negatively charged terminal amino acids(arrows) causes the backbone to extend so that the negative amino acids are asfar apart as possible Figure B shows a close-up of an end amino acid A signal,in this case a molecule with a very positive electric charge (white sphere), isattracted to and binds with the negative site on the protein’s terminal aminoacid In our particular scenario, the signal is more positive in charge than theamino acid is negative in charge After the signal couples with the protein,there is now an excess positive charge at this end of the backbone Sincepositive and negative charges attract one another, the backbone’s amino acidswill rotate around their bonds so that positive and negative terminals will comecloser together Figure C shows the protein changing from conformation A toconformation B Changing conformations generates movement and the movement isharnessed to do work, providing for such functions as digestion, respiration,and muscle contraction When the signal detaches, the protein returns to itspreferred extended conformation This is how signal-generated protein movementsprovide for lifeThe shape-shifting proteins exemplify an even more impressive engineering featbecause their precise, three-dimensional shapes also give them the ability tolink up with other proteins. When a protein encounters a molecule that is aphysical and energetic complement, the two bind together like human-madeproducts with interlocking gears, say an eggbeater or an old-fashioned watch.Examine the following two illustrations. The first shows five uniquely shapedproteins, examples of the molecular “gears” found in cells. These organic“gears” have softer edges than machine shop-manufactured gears, but you can seethat their precise, three-dimensional shapes would enable them to securelyengage with other complementary proteins.-1743749518 [images/9781401923112_0057_002.jpg]Protein Menagerie. Illustrated above are five different examples of proteinmolecules. Each protein possesses a precise three-dimensional conformation thatis the same for each copy of itself in every cell. A) Enzyme that digestshydrogen atoms; B) Woven filament of collagen protein; C) Channel, amembrane-bound protein with hollow central pore; D) Protein subunit of “capsule”that encloses a virus; E) DNA-synthesizing enzyme with attached helical DNAmoleculeIn the second illustration (p. 29), I chose a wind-up watch to represent theworkings of the cell. The first picture shows a metal machine, revealing thegears, springs, jewels, and case of the watch model. When Gear A turns it causesGear B to turn. When B moves it causes Gear C to turn, etc. In the next image, Ioverlay the human-made machine gears with softer-edged organic proteins(magnified millions of times in proportion to the watch) so that it becomesvisually conceivable that proteins could be like the watch’s mechanism. In thismetal-protein “machine,” one can imagine Protein A rotating and causing ProteinB to revolve, which in turn causes Protein C to move. Once you see thatpossibility, you can look to the third figure in which the human-made parts areremoved. Voilà! We are left with a protein “machine,” one of the thousands ofsimilar protein assemblies that collectively comprise the cell!Cytoplasmic proteins that cooperate in creating specific physiologic functionsare grouped into specific assemblies known as pathways. These assemblies areidentified by functions such as respiration pathways, digestion pathways, musclecontraction pathways, and the infamous, energy-generating Krebs cycle, the baneof many a science student who has to memorize every one of its proteincomponents and complex chemical reactions.Can you imagine how excited cell biologists were when they figured out how theprotein assembly machines work? Cells exploit the movements of these proteinassembly machines to empower specific metabolic and behavioral functions. Theconstant, shape-shifting movements of proteins—which can occur thousands oftimes in a single second—are the movements that propel life.-1743749461 [images/9781401923112_0058_004.jpg]The Primacy of DNAYou’ll notice that, in the above section, I didn’t discuss DNA at all. That’sbecause it is the changing of the proteins’ electromagnetic charges that isresponsible for their behavior-generating movement, not DNA. How did we get tothe widespread and often-cited notion that genes “control” biology? In theOrigin of Species, Darwin suggested that “hereditary” factors were passed onfrom generation to generation, controlling the traits of the offspring. Darwin’sinfluence was so great that scientists myopically focused on identifying thathereditary material which, they thought, controlled life.In 1910, intensive microscopic analyses revealed that the hereditary informationpassed on generation after generation was contained in chromosomes, thread-likestructures that become visible in the cell just before it divides into two“daughter” cells. Chromosomes are incorporated into the daughter cell’s largestorganelle, the nucleus. When scientists isolated the nucleus, they dissected thechromosomes and found that the hereditary elements were essentially comprised ofonly two kinds of molecules, protein and DNA. Somehow the protein machinery oflife was entangled in the structure and function of these chromosome molecules.The understanding of the chromosome’s functions was further refined in 1944 whenscientists determined that it was DNA that actually contained hereditaryinformation. (Avery, et al, 1944; Lederberg 1994) The experiments that singledout DNA were elegant. These scientists isolated pure DNA from one species ofbacteria—let’s call it Species A—and added the pure DNA to cultures containingonly Species B bacteria. Within a short time, Species B bacteria began to showhereditary traits that were formerly seen only in Species A. Once it was knownthat you needed nothing other than DNA to pass on traits, the DNA moleculebecame a scientific superstar.It was now left to Watson and Crick to unravel the structure and function ofthat superstar molecule. DNA molecules are long and threadlike. They are madefrom four nitrogen-containing chemicals called bases (adenine, thymine,cytosine, and guanine, or A, T, C, and G). Watson and Crick’s discovery of DNA’sstructure led to the fact that the sequence of the A, T, C, and G bases in DNAspells out the sequence of amino acids along a protein’s backbone (Watson andCrick 1953). Those long strings of DNA molecules can be subdivided into singlegenes, segments that provide the blueprint for specific proteins. The code forrecreating the protein machinery of the cell had been cracked!Watson and Crick also explained why DNA is the perfect hereditary molecule. EachDNA strand is normally intertwined with a second strand of DNA, a looselywrapped configuration known as the “double helix.” The genius of this system isthat the sequences of DNA bases on both strands are mirror images of each other.When the two strands of DNA unwind, each single strand contains the informationto make an exact, complementary copy of itself. So through a process ofseparating the strands of a double helix, DNA molecules become self-replicating.This observation led to the assumption that DNA “controlled” its own replication… it was its own “boss.”The “suggestion” that DNA controlled its own replication and served as theblueprint for the body’s proteins led Francis Crick to create biology’s CentralDogma, the belief that DNA rules. The dogma is so fundamental to modern biologyit is essentially written in stone, the equivalent of science’s TenCommandments. The dogma, also referred to as “the Primacy of DNA,” is a fixtureof every scientific text.In the dogma’s scheme of how life unfolds, DNA perches loftily on top, followedby RNA. RNA is the short-lived Xerox copy of the DNA. As such, it is thephysical template encoding the amino acid sequence that makes up a protein’sbackbone. The Primacy of DNA diagram provides the logic for the Age of GeneticDeterminism. Because the character of a living organism is defined by the natureof its proteins and its proteins are encoded in the DNA, then by logic, DNAwould represent the “first cause,” or primary determinant of an organism’straits.The Human Genome ProjectAfter DNA achieved superstar status, the remaining challenge was to create acatalog of all the genetic stars in the human firmament. Enter the Human GenomeProject, a global, scientific effort begun in the late 1980s to create a catalogof all the genes present in humans.From the outset, the Human Genome Project was a massively ambitious one.Conventional thought held that the body needed one gene to provide the blueprintfor each of the 100,000 plus different proteins that make up our bodies. Add tothat at least 20,000 regulatory genes, which orchestrate the activity of theprotein-encoding genes. Scientists concluded that the human genome would containa minimum of 120,000 genes located within the twenty-three pairs of humanchromosomes.But that wasn’t the whole story. A cosmic joke was unfolding, one of those jokesthat periodically unsettle scientists convinced they have discovered the secretsof the universe. Consider the impact of Nicolaus Copernicus’ discovery publishedin 1543 that the Earth was not the center of the universe, as was thought by thescientist-theologians of the day. The fact that the Earth actually revolvedaround the sun and that the sun itself was not the center of the universeundermined the teachings of the Church. Copernicus’ paradigm-busting discoverieslaunched the modern, scientific revolution by challenging the presumed“infallibility” of the Church. Science eventually displaced the Church asWestern civilization’s source of wisdom for understanding the mysteries of theuniverse.Geneticists experienced a comparable shock when, contrary to their expectationsof over 120,000 genes, they found that the entire human genome consists ofapproximately 25,000 genes. (Pennisi 2003a and 2003b; Pearson 2003; Goodman2003) More than eighty percent of the presumed and required DNA does not exist!The missing genes are proving to be more troublesome than the missing eighteenminutes of the Nixon tapes. The one-gene, one-protein concept was a fundamentaltenet of genetic determinism. Now that the Human Genome Project has toppled theone-gene for one-protein concept, our current theories of how life works have tobe scrapped. No longer is it possible to believe that genetic engineers can,with relative ease, fix all our biological dilemmas. There are simply not enoughgenes to account for the complexity of human life or of human disease.-1743749279 [images/9781401923112_0062_001.jpg]The Central Dogma. The dogma, also referred to as the Primacy of DNA, definesthe flow of information in biological organisms. As indicated by the arrows, theflow is only in one direction, from DNA to RNA and then to protein. The DNArepresents the cell’s long-term memory, passed from generation to generation.RNA, an unstable copy of the DNA molecule, is the active memory that is used bythe cell as a physical template in synthesizing proteins. Proteins are themolecular building blocks that provide for the cell’s structure and behavior.DNA is implicated as the “source” that controls the character of the cell’sproteins, hence the concept of DNA’s primacy that literally means “first cause.”I may sound like Chicken Little shouting that the genetics sky is falling.However, you don’t have to take my word for it. Chicken Big is saying the samething. In a commentary on the surprising results of the Human Genome Project,David Baltimore, one of the world’s preeminent geneticists and a Nobel Prizewinner, addressed the issue of human complexity (Baltimore 2001):“But unless the human genome contains a lot of genes that are opaque to ourcomputers, it is clear that we do not gain our undoubted complexity over wormsand plants by using more genes.“Understanding what does give us our complexity—our enormous behavioralrepertoire, ability to produce conscious action, remarkable physicalcoordination, precisely tuned alterations in response to external variations ofthe environments, learning, memory, need I go on?—remains a challenge for thefuture.”As Baltimore states, the results of the Human Genome Project force us toconsider other ideas about how life is controlled. “Understanding what does giveus our complexity … remains a challenge for the future.” The sky is falling.In addition, the results of the Human Genome Project are forcing us toreconsider our genetic relationship with other organisms in the biosphere. Wecan no longer use genes to explain why humans are at the top of the evolutionaryladder. It turns out there is not much difference in the total number of genesfound in humans and those found in primitive organisms. Let’s take a look atthree of the most studied animal models in genetic research, a microscopicnematode roundworm known as Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly, and thelaboratory mouse.The primitive Caenorhabditis worm serves as a perfect model for studying therole of genes in development and behavior. This rapidly growing and reproducingorganism has a precisely patterned body comprised of exactly 969 cells and asimple brain of about 302 cells. Nonetheless it has a unique repertoire ofbehaviors and most importantly, it is amenable to genetic experimentation. Theaenorhabditis genome consists of approximately 24,000 genes. (Blaxter 2003) Thehuman body, comprised of over fifty trillion cells, contains only 1,500 moregenes than the lowly, spineless, thousand-celled microscopic worm.The fruit fly, another favored research subject, has 15,000 genes. (Blaxter2003; Celniker, et al, 2002) So the profoundly more complicated fruit fly has9,000 fewer genes than the more primitive Caenorhabditis worm. And when it comesto the question of mice and men, we might have to think more highly of them orless of ourselves; the results of parallel genome projects reveal that humansand rodents have roughly the same number of genes!Cell Biology 101In retrospect, scientists should have known that genes couldn’t provide thecontrol of our lives. By definition, the brain is the organ responsible forcontrolling and coordinating the physiology and behavior of an organism. But isthe nucleus truly the cell’s brain? If our assumption that the nucleus and itsDNA-containing material is the “brain” of the cell, then removing the cell’snucleus, a procedure called enucleation, should result in the immediate death ofthe cell.And now, for the big experiment … (Maestro, a drumroll if you please).The scientist drags our unwilling cell into the microscopic operating arena andstraps it down. Using a micromanipulator, the scientist guides a needle-likemicropipette into position above the cell. With a deft thrust of themanipulator, our investigator plunges the pipette deep into the cell’scytoplasmic interior. By applying a little suction, the nucleus is drawn up intothe pipette, and the pipette is withdrawn from the cell. Below thenucleus-engorged pipette lies our sacrificial cell—its “brain” torn out.But wait! It’s still moving! My God … the cell is still alive!The wound has closed and like a recovering surgical patient, the cell begins toslowly stagger about. Soon the cell is back on its feet (okay, its pseudopods),fleeing the microscope’s field with the hope that it will never see a doctoragain.Following enucleation, many cells can survive for up to two or more monthswithout genes. Viable enucleated cells do not lie about like brain-dead lumps ofcytoplasm on life-support systems. These cells actively ingest and metabolizefood, maintain coordinated operation of their physiologic systems (respiration,digestion, excretion, motility, etc.), retain an ability to communicate withother cells, and are able to engage in appropriate responses to growth andprotection requiring environmental stimuli.Unsurprisingly, enucleation is not without side effects. Without their genes,cells are not able to divide, nor are they able to reproduce any protein partsthey lose through the normal wear and tear of the cytoplasm. The inability toreplace defective cytoplasmic proteins contributes to mechanical dysfunctionsthat ultimately result in the death of the cell.Our experiment was designed to test the idea that the nucleus is the “brain” ofthe cell. If the cell had died immediately following enucleation, theobservations would have at least supported that belief. However, the results areunambiguous: enucleated cells still exhibit complex, coordinated,life-sustaining behaviors, which imply that the cell’s “brain” is still intactand functioning.The fact that enucleated cells retain their biological functions in the absenceof genes is by no means a new discovery. Over a hundred years ago, classicalembryologists routinely removed the nuclei from dividing egg cells and showedthat a single, enucleated egg cell was able to develop as far as the blastula,an embryonic stage consisting of forty or more cells. Today, enucleated cellsare used for industrial purposes as living “feeder” layers in cell culturesdesigned for virus vaccine production.If the nucleus and its genes are not the cell’s brain, then what exactly isDNA’s contribution to cellular life? Enucleated cells die, not because they havelost their brain but because they have lost their reproductive capabilities.Without the ability to reproduce their parts, enucleated cells cannot replacefailed protein building blocks, nor replicate themselves. So the nucleus is notthe brain of the cell—the nucleus is the cell’s gonad! Confusing the gonad withthe brain is an understandable error because science has always been and stillis a patriarchal endeavor. Males have often been accused of thinking with theirgonads, so it’s not entirely surprising that science has inadvertently confusedthe nucleus with the cell’s brain!Epigenetics: The New Science of Self-EmpowermentGenes-as-destiny theorists have obviously ignored hundred-year old science aboutenucleated cells, but they cannot ignore new research that undermines theirbelief in genetic determinism. While the Human Genome Project was makingheadlines, a group of scientists were inaugurating a new, revolutionary field inbiology called epigenetics. The science of epigenetics, which literally means“control above genetics,” profoundly changes our understanding of how life iscontrolled. (Pray 2004; Silverman 2004) In the last decade, epigenetic researchhas established that DNA blueprints passed down through genes are not set inconcrete at birth. Genes are not destiny! Environmental influences, includingnutrition, stress, and emotions, can modify those genes without changing theirbasic blueprint. And those modifications, epigeneticists have discovered, can bepassed on to future generations as surely as DNA blueprints are passed on viathe double helix. (Reik and Walter 2001; Surani 2001)There is no doubt that epigenetic discoveries have lagged behind geneticdiscoveries. Since the late 1940s, biologists have been isolating DNA from thecell’s nucleus in order to study genetic mechanisms. In the process they extractthe nucleus from the cell, break open its enveloping membrane, and remove thechromosomal contents, half of which is made up of DNA and half of which is madeup of regulatory proteins. In their zeal to study DNA, most scientists threwaway the proteins, which we now know is the equivalent of throwing the baby outwith the bathwater. Epige-neticists are bringing back the baby, by studying thechromosome’s proteins, and those proteins are turning out to play as crucial arole in heredity as DNA.In the chromosome, the DNA forms the core, and the proteins cover the DNA like asleeve. When the genes are covered, their information cannot be “read.” Imagineyour bare arm as a piece of DNA representing the gene that codes for blue eyes.In the nucleus, this stretch of DNA is covered by bound regulatory proteins,which cover your blue-eye gene like a shirtsleeve, making it impossible to beread.-1743749022 [images/9781401923112_0067_001.jpg]Primacy of Environment. The new science reveals that the information thatcontrols biology starts with environmental signals that, in turn, control thebinding of regulatory proteins to the DNA. Regulatory proteins direct theactivity of genes. The DNA, RNA, and protein functions are the same as describedin the Primacy of DNA chart. Note: the flow of information is no longerunidirectional. In the 1960s, Howard Temin challenged the Central Dogma withexperiments that revealed RNA could go against the predicted flow of informationand rewrite the DNA. Originally ridiculed for his “heresy,” Temin later won aNobel Prize for describing reverse transcriptase, the molecular mechanism bywhich RNA can rewrite the genetic code. Reverse transcriptase is now notorious,for it is used by the AIDS virus’ RNA to commandeer the infected cell’s DNA. Itis also now known that changes in the DNA molecule, such as adding or removingmethyl chemical groups, influence the binding of regulatory proteins. Proteinsmust also be able to buck the predicted flow of information, since proteinantibodies in immune cells are involved with changing the DNA in the cells thatsynthesize them. The size of the arrows indicating information flow are not thesame. There are tight restrictions on the reverse flow of information, a designthat would prevent radical changes to the cell’s genome.How do you get that sleeve off? You need an environmental signal to spur the“sleeve” protein to change shape, i.e., detach from the DNA’s double helix,allowing the gene to be read. Once the DNA is uncovered, the cell makes a copyof the exposed gene. As a result, the activity of the gene is “controlled” bythe presence or absence of the ensleeving proteins, which are in turn controlledby environmental signals.The story of epigenetic control is the story of how environmental signalscontrol the activity of genes. It is now clear that the Primacy of DNA chartdescribed earlier is outmoded. The revised scheme of information flow should nowbe called the “Primacy of the Environment.” The new, more sophisticated flow ofinformation in biology starts with an environmental signal, then goes to aregulatory protein and only then goes to DNA, RNA, and the end result, aprotein.The science of epigenetics has also made it clear that there are two mechanismsby which organisms pass on hereditary information. Those two mechanisms providea way for scientists to study both the contribution of nature (genes) and thecontribution of nurture (epigenetic mechanisms) in human behavior. If you onlyfocus on the blueprints, as scientists have been doing for decades, theinfluence of the environment is impossible to fathom. (Dennis 2003; Chakravartiand Little 2003)Let’s present an analogy, which hopefully will make the relationship betweenepigenetic and genetic mechanisms clearer. Are you old enough to remember thedays when television programming stopped after midnight? After the normalprogramming signed off, a “test pattern” would appear on the screen. Most testpatterns looked like a dartboard with a bull’s eye in the middle, similar to theone pictured on the following page.Think of the pattern of the test screen as the pattern encoded by a given gene,say the one for brown eyes. The dials and switches of the TV fine-tune the testscreen by allowing you to turn it on and off and modulate a number ofcharacteristics, including color, hue, contrast, brightness, and vertical andhorizontal holds. By adjusting the dials, you can alter the appearance of thepattern on the screen, while not actually changing the original broadcastpattern. This is precisely the role of regulatory proteins. Studies of proteinsynthesis reveal that epigenetic “dials” can create 2,000 or more variations ofproteins from the same gene blueprint. (Bray 2003; Schmuker, et al, 2000)-1743748914 [images/9781401923112_0069_001.jpg]In this epigenetic analogy, the test pattern on the screen represents theprotein backbone pattern encoded by a gene. While the TV’s controls can changethe appearance of the pattern (B and C), they do not change the original patternof the broadcast (i.e., the gene). Epigenetic control modifies the read-out of agene without changing the DNA code.Parental Life Experiences Shape Their Children’s Genetic CharacterWe now know that the environmentally influenced fine-tuning described above canbe passed from generation to generation. A landmark Duke University studypublished in the August 1, 2003 issue of Molecular and Cellular Biology foundthat an enriched environment can even override genetic mutations in mice.(Waterland and Jirtle 2003) In the study, scientists looked at the effect ofdietary supplements on pregnant mice with the abnormal “agouti” gene. Agoutimice have yellow coats and are extremely obese, which predisposes them tocardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.-1743748874 [images/9781401923112_0070_001.jpg]Agouti Sisters. One year old female genetically identical agouti mice. Maternalmethyl donor supplementation shifts coat color of the offspring from yellow tobrown and reduces the incidence of obesity, diabetes, and cancer. (Photocourtesy of Jirtle and Waterland©)In the experiment, one group of yellow, obese, agouti mothers receivedmethyl-group-rich supplements available in health food stores: folic acid,vitamin B12, betaine, and choline. Methyl-rich supplements were chosen because anumber of studies have shown that the methyl chemical group is involved withepigenetic modifications. When methyl groups attach to a gene’s DNA, it changesthe binding characteristics of regulatory chromosomal proteins. If the proteinsbind too tightly to the gene, the protein sleeve cannot be removed and the genecannot be read. Methylating DNA can silence or modify gene activity.This time the headlines “Diet Trumps Genes” were accurate. The mothers who gotthe methyl-group-rich supplements produced standard, lean, brown mice, eventhough their offspring had the same agouti gene as their mothers. The agoutimothers who didn’t get the supplements produced yellow pups, which ate much morethan the brown pups. The yellow pups wound up weighing almost twice as much astheir lean, “pseudo-agouti” counterparts.The University’s photo on the previous page is striking. Though the two mice aregenetically identical, they are radically different in appearance: one mouse islean and brown and the other mouse is obese and yellow. What you can’t see inthe picture is that the obese mouse is diabetic while its genetically identicalcounterpart is healthy.Other studies have found epigenetic mechanisms to be a factor in a variety ofdiseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. In fact, only5 percent of cancer and cardiovascular patients can attribute their disease toheredity. (Willett 2002) While the media made a big hoopla over the discovery ofthe BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes, they failed to emphasize thatninety-five percent of breast cancers are not due to inherited genes. Themalignancies in a significant number of cancer patients are derived fromenvironmentally induced epigenetic alterations and not defective genes. (Kling2003; Jones 2001; Seppa 2000; Baylin 1997)The epigenetic evidence has become so compelling that some brave scientists areeven invoking the “L” word for Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, the much-scornedevolutionist, who believed that traits acquired as a result of environmentalinfluence could be passed on. Philosopher Eva Jablonka and biologist Marion Lambwrote in their 1995 book Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution—The LamarckianDimension: “In recent years, molecular biology has shown that the genome is farmore fluid and responsive to the environment than previously supposed. It hasalso shown that information can be transmitted to descendants in ways other thanthrough the base sequence of DNA.” (Jablonka and Lamb 1995)We’re back to where we started in this chapter, the environment. In my own workin the laboratory, I saw over and over the impact a changed environment had onthe cells I was studying. But it was only at the end of my research career, atStanford, that the message fully sank in. I saw that endothelial cells, whichare the blood vessel-lining cells I was studying, changed their structure andfunction depending on their environment. When, for example, I added inflammatorychemicals to the tissue culture, the cells rapidly became the equivalent ofmacrophages, the scavengers of the immune system. What was also exciting to mewas that the cells transformed even when I destroyed their DNA with gamma rays.These endothelial cells were “functionally enucleated,” yet they completelychanged their biological behavior in response to inflammatory agents, just asthey had when their nuclei were intact. These cells were clearly showing some“intelligent” control in the absence of their genes. (Lipton 1991)Twenty years after my mentor Irv Konigsberg’s advice to first consider theenvironment when your cells are ailing, I finally got it. DNA does not controlbiology, and the nucleus itself is not the brain of the cell. Just like you andme, cells are shaped by where they live. In other words, it’s the environment,stupid."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3141]-1743748772 [images/9781401923112_0074_002.jpg]THE MAGICAL MEMBRANENow that we’ve looked at the protein assembly machinery of the cell, debunkedthe notion that the nucleus is the brain of the cellular operation, andrecognized the crucial role the environment plays in the operation of the cell,we’re on to the good stuff—the stuff that can make sense of your life and giveyou insight into ways of changing it.This chapter puts forth my nominee for the true brain that controls cellularlife—the membrane. I believe that when you understand how the chemical andphysical structure of the cell’s membrane works, you’ll start calling it, as Ido, the magical membrane. Or alternatively, capitalizing on the fact that partof the word is a homophone for brain, I refer to it in my lectures as themagical mem-Brain. And when you couple your understanding of the magicalmembrane with an understanding of the exciting world of quantum physics thatI’ll present in the next chapter, you will also understand how wrong thetabloids were in 1953. The true secret of life does not lie in the famed doublehelix. The true secret of life lies in understanding the elegantly simplebiological mechanisms of the magical membrane—the mechanisms by which your bodytranslates environmental signals into behavior.When I started studying cell biology in the 1960s, the idea that the membranewas the cell’s brain would have been considered laughable. And I have to concedethat the membrane in those days was a sorry-looking Mensa candidate. Themembrane seemed to be just a simple, semi-permeable, three-layered skin thatheld the contents of the cytoplasm together. Think Saran wrap with holes.One reason scientists misjudged the membrane is that it is so thin. Membranesare only seven millionths of a millimeter thick. In fact, they are so thin thatthey can only be seen with an electron microscope, which was developed after theSecond World War. So it wasn’t until the 1950s that biologists could evenconfirm that cell membranes exist. Up until that time, many biologists thoughtthe cell’s cytoplasm held together because it had a Jello-like consistency. Withthe aid of microscopes, biologists learned that all living cells have membranesand that all cell membranes share the same basic, three-layered structure.However, the simplicity of that structure belies its functional complexity.Cell biologists gained insight into the amazing abilities of the cell membraneby studying the most primitive organisms on this planet, the prokaryotes.Prokaryotes, which include bacteria and other microbes, consist only of a cellmembrane that envelops a droplet of soupy cytoplasm. Though prokaryotesrepresent life in its most primitive form, they have purpose. A bacterium doesnot bounce around in its world like a ball in a pinball machine. A bacteriumcarries out the basic physiologic processes of life like more complicated cells.A bacterium eats, digests, breathes, excretes waste matter, and even exhibits“neurological” processing. They can sense where there is food and propelthemselves to that spot. Similarly, they can recognize toxins and predators andpurposely employ escape maneuvers to save their lives. In other words,prokaryotes display intelligence!So what structure in the prokaryotic cell provides its “intelligence”? Theprokaryotes’ cytoplasm has no evident organelles, such as the nucleus andmitochondria, that are found in more advanced, eukaryotic cells. The onlyorganized cellular structure that can be considered a candidate for theprokaryote’s brain is its cell membrane.Bread, Butter, Olives, and PimentosAs I came to the realization that membranes were characteristic of allintelligent life, I focused my attention on understanding their structure andfunction. I came up with a gastronomic treat (just kidding) to illustrate thebasic structure of the membrane. The treat consists of a bread and buttersandwich. To further refine the analogy, I added olives. Actually my instructivesandwich features two kinds of olives, ones stuffed with pimentos, the otherspimento-free. Gourmands, don’t groan. When I’ve left this sandwich out of mylectures, repeat members of the audience have asked me where it went!Here’s an easy experiment to show you how the “sandwich” membrane works. Make abread-and-butter sandwich (at the moment free of olives). This sandwichrepresents a section of the cell membrane.Now pour a teaspoon of colored dye on top of the sandwich.-1743748674 [images/9781401923112_0076_005.jpg]As illustrated below, the dye seeps through the bread but stops when it gets tothe butter because the oily substance in the middle of the sandwich provides aneffective barrier.-1743748671 [images/9781401923112_0077_002.jpg]Now let’s make a bread and butter sandwich with stuffed and unstuffed olives.-1743748665 [images/9781401923112_0077_004.jpg]Now when we add the dye to the bread and slice the sandwich, we see a differentresult. When the dye hits a pimento-stuffed olive, it stops as surely as itstopped when it hit butter. But when the dye reaches an olive without a pimento,the pitted olive provides a channel through which the dye can flow freely acrossthe middle of the sandwich, then through the bread to the plate.-1743748661 [images/9781401923112_0078_002.jpg]The plate in this analogy represents the cell’s cytoplasm. By passing throughthe pimento-free olive, the dye penetrates the buttery layer to reach the otherside of the “membrane” sandwich. The dye has successfully navigated theformidable, fatty, membrane barrier!It is important for the cell to allow molecules to break through the barrierbecause in my sandwich analogy, the dye is life-sustaining food. If the membranewere simply a bread and butter sandwich, it would provide a fortress-likebarrier that keeps out the cacophony of innumerable molecular and radiant energysignals that make up a cell’s environment. But the cell would die if themembrane were such a fortress because it would get no nutrients. When you addthe pimento-free olives, which allow information and food into the cell, themembrane becomes a vital and ingenious mechanism enabling selected nutrients topenetrate the interior of the cell, just as the teaspoonful of dye made its wayto the plate.In real-life cellular biology, the bread-and-butter portion of the sandwichrepresents the membrane’s phospholipids, one of the two major chemicalcomponents of the membrane. (The other major chemical components are the “olive”proteins, which we’ll get to below.) I call phospholipids “schizophrenic”because they are composed of both polar and nonpolar molecules.The fact that phospholipids contain both polar and nonpolar molecules may notsound like a recipe for schizophrenia to you, but I assure you it is. All themolecules in our universe can be divided into nonpolar and polar categoriesbased on the type of chemical bonds that hold their atoms together. The bondsamong polar molecules have positive and/or negative charges, hence theirpolarity. These molecules’ positive and negative charges cause them to behavelike magnets, attracting or repelling other charged molecules.Polar molecules include water and things that dissolve in water. Nonpolarmolecules include oil and substances that dissolve in oil; there are no positiveor negative charges among their atoms. Remember the adage “water and oil don’tmix”? Neither do oily nonpolar and watery polar molecules. To visualize the lackof interaction between polar and nonpolar molecules, think of your bottle ofItalian salad dressing. You do your best to get vinegar and oil to bond byshaking the bottle, but when you set the bottle down, they separate. That’sbecause molecules, like people, prefer environments that offer them stability.For their stability, polar (vinegar) molecules seek out watery polarenvironments and nonpolar (olive oil) molecules seek out nonpolar environments.Phospholipid molecules, comprised of both polar and nonpolar lipid regions, havea difficult time in seeking stability. The phosphate portion of the molecule ismotivated to seek water, while its lipid portion abhors water and seeksstability by dissolving in oil.-1743748605 [images/9781401923112_0080_001.jpg]Electron micrograph showing the cell membrane at the surface of a human cell.The dark-light-dark layering of the cell membrane is due to the ordering of thebarrier’s phospholipid molecules (inset). The lighter center of the membrane,the equivalent of the butter in our sandwich, represents the hydrophobic zoneformed by the legs of the phospholipids. The dark layers above and below thecentral lipid zone, the equivalent of the bread slices, represent the molecule’swater-loving phosphate heads.Getting back to our sandwich, the membrane’s phospholipids are shaped likelollipops with an extra stick (see illustration above). The round part of thelollipop has polar charges among its atoms; it corresponds to the bread of oursandwich. The molecule’s two stick-like portions are nonpolar; they correspondto the butter part of our sandwich. Because the “butter” portion of the membraneis nonpolar, it does not let positively or negatively charged atoms or moleculespass through it. In effect, this lipid core is an electrical insulator, aterrific trait for a membrane designed to keep the cell from being overwhelmedby every molecule in its environment.But the cell could not survive if the membrane were the equivalent of a simplebread and butter sandwich. Most of the cell’s nutrients consist of charged polarmolecules that would not be able to get past the formidable nonpolar lipidbarrier. Neither could the cell excrete its polarized waste products.Integral Membrane ProteinsThe olives in our sandwich are the truly ingenious part of the membrane. Theseproteins allow nutrients, waste materials, as well as other forms of“information” to be transported across the membrane. The protein “olives” allownot just any old molecules to get into the cell but only those moleculesnecessary for the smooth functioning of the cytoplasm. In my sandwich, theolives represent Integral Membrane Proteins (IMPs). These proteins embedthemselves into the “butter” layer of the membrane, just as I have embeddedolives in the illustration.How do IMPs embed themselves into the butter? Remember that proteins arecomposed of a linear backbone assembled from linked amino acids. Of the twentydifferent amino acids, some are water-loving, polar molecules and some arehydrophobic, nonpolar molecules. When a region of the protein’s backbone is madeup of linked, hydrophobic amino acids, this segment of the protein seeksstability by finding an oil-loving environment like the membrane’s lipid core(see arrow below). That’s how hydrophobic parts of the protein integratethemselves into the middle layer of the membrane. Because some regions of aprotein’s backbone are made up of polar amino acids and other regions arenonpolar, the protein strand will weave itself in and out of thebread-and-butter sandwich.-1743748525 [images/9781401923112_0081_004.jpg]There are lots of IMPs with lots of different names, but they can be subdividedinto two functional classes: receptor proteins and effector proteins. ReceptorIMPs are the cell’s sense organs, the equivalent of our eyes, ears, nose, tastebuds, etc. Receptors function as molecular “nano-antennas” tuned to respond tospecific environmental signals. Some receptors extend inward from the membranesurface to monitor the internal milieu of the cell. Other receptor proteinsextend from the cell’s outer surface, monitoring external signals.Like other proteins, which we discussed earlier, receptors have an inactive andan active shape and shift back and forth between those conformations as theirelectrical charges are altered. When a receptor protein binds with anenvironmental signal, the resulting alteration in the protein’s electricalcharges causes the backbone to change shape and the protein adopts an “active”conformation. Cells possess a uniquely “tuned” receptor protein for everyenvironmental signal that needs to be read.Some receptors respond to physical signals. One example is an estrogen receptor,which is specially designed to complement the shape and charge distribution ofan estrogen molecule. When estrogen is in its receptor’s neighborhood, theestrogen receptor locks on to it, as surely as a magnet picks up paper clips.Once the estrogen receptor and the estrogen molecule bind in a perfect “lock andkey” fit, the receptor’s electromagnetic charge changes and the protein shiftsinto its active conformation. Similarly, histamine receptors complement theshape of histamine molecules, and insulin receptors complement the shape ofinsulin molecules.Receptor “antennas” can also read vibrational energy fields such as light,sound, and radio frequencies. The antennas on these “energy” receptors vibratelike tuning forks. If an energy vibration in the environment resonates with areceptor’s antenna, it will alter the protein’s charge, causing the receptor tochange shape. (Tsong 1989) I’ll cover this more completely in the next chapter,but I’d like to point out now that because receptors can read energy fields, thenotion that only physical molecules can impact cell physiology is outmoded.Biological behavior can be controlled by invisible forces, including thought, aswell as it can be controlled by physical molecules like penicillin, a fact thatprovides the scientific underpinning for pharmaceutical-free energy medicine.Receptor proteins are remarkable, but on their own they do not impact thebehavior of the cell. While the receptor provides an awareness of environmentalsignals, the cell still has to engage in an appropriate, life-sustainingresponse, that is the venue of the effector proteins. Taken together, thereceptor-effector proteins are a stimulus-response mechanism comparable to thereflex action that doctors typically test during physical examinations. When adoctor taps your knee with a mallet, a sensory nerve picks up the signal. Thatsensory nerve immediately passes on that information to a motor nerve thatcauses the leg to kick. The membrane’s receptors are the equivalent of sensorynerves, and the effector proteins are the equivalent of action-generating motornerves. Together, the receptor-effector complex acts as a switch, translatingenvironmental signals into cellular behavior.It is only in recent years that scientists have realized the importance of themembrane’s IMPs. They are in fact so important that studying the way IMPs workhas become a field of its own called “signal transduction.” Signal transductionscientists are busily classifying hundreds of complex information pathways thatlie between the membrane’s reception of environmental signals and the activationof the cell’s behavior proteins. The study of signal transduction is catapultingthe membrane to center stage, just as the field of epigenetics is highlightingthe role of the chromosome’s proteins.There are different kinds of behavior-controlling effector proteins becausethere are lots of jobs that need to be done for the smooth functioning of thecell. Transport proteins, for example, include an extensive family of channelproteins that shuttle molecules and information from one side of the membranebarrier to the other. Which brings us back to the pimentos in our bread, butter,and olive sandwich. Many channel proteins are shaped like a tightly woundsphere, resembling the pimento-stuffed olives in our pictures. (Seeillustration.) When the electrical charge on the protein is altered, the proteinchanges shape, a change that creates an open channel running through theprotein’s core. Channel proteins are actually two olives in one, depending ontheir electrical charge. In the active mode, their structure resembles apimento-free olive, with an open gate. In their inactive mode the proteins’shape resembles a pimento-stuffed olive that stays closed to the world outsidethe cell.The activity of one specific channel type, sodium-potassium ATPase, meritsspecial attention. Every cell has thousands of these channels built into themembrane. Collectively, their activity uses almost half of your body’s energyevery day. This channel opens and closes so frequently that it resembles arevolving door in a department store on the day of a big sale. Every time thischannel revolves, it shuttles three positive-charged sodium atoms out of thecytoplasm and simultaneously admits two positive-charged potassium atoms intothe cytoplasm from the environment.Sodium-potassium ATPase not only uses up a lot of energy, it also creates energyas surely as store-bought batteries provide energy for Game Boys (at least untilyour kids wear them out). Actually, the energy-producing activity ofsodium-potassium ATPase is a lot better than the batteries your kids wear outbecause it turns the cell into a constantly recharging biological battery.Here’s how sodium-potassium ATPase manages that trick. Every revolution ofsodium-potassium ATPase throws more positive charges out than it lets in to thecell, and there are thousands of these proteins in each cell. As these proteinsgo through hundreds of cycles per second, the inside of the cell becomesnegatively charged while the outside of the cell becomes positively charged. Thenegative charge below the membrane is referred to as the membrane potential. Ofcourse the lipid, i.e., the butter portion of the membrane, does not let chargedatoms cross the barrier, so the internal charge stays negative. The positivecharge outside the cell and the negative charge inside make the cell essentiallya self-charging battery whose energy is used to empower biological processes.Another variety of effector proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, regulates the shapeand motility of cells. A third variety, called enzymes, breaks down orsynthesizes molecules, which is why enzymes are sold in your local health foodstore as a digestive aid. When activated, all forms of effector proteins,including channels, cytoskeletal and enzyme proteins or their byproducts, canalso serve as signals that activate genes. These IMPs or their byproductsprovide signals that control the binding of the chromosome’s regulatory proteinsthat form a “sleeve” around the DNA. In contrast to conventional wisdom, genesdo not control their own activity. Instead it is the membrane’s effectorproteins, operating in response to environmental signals picked up by themembrane’s receptors, which control the “reading” of genes so that worn-outproteins can be replaced or new proteins can be created.How the Brain WorksOnce I understood how IMPs worked, I had to conclude that the cell’s operationsare primarily molded by its interaction with the environment, not by its geneticcode. There is no doubt that the DNA blueprints stored in the nucleus areremarkable molecules, which have been accumulated over three billion years ofevolution. But as remarkable as these DNA blueprints are, they do not “control”the operations of the cell. Logically, genes cannot preprogram a cell ororganism’s life because cell survival depends on the ability to dynamicallyadjust to an ever-changing environment.The membrane’s function of interacting “intelligently” with the environment toproduce behavior makes it the true brain of the cell. Let’s put the membrane tothe same “brain” test to which we put the nucleus. When you destroy itsmembrane, the cell dies just as you would if your brain were removed. Even ifyou leave the membrane intact, destroying only its receptor proteins, which caneasily be done with digestive enzymes in the lab, the cell becomes “brain-dead.”It is comatose because it no longer receives the environmental signals necessaryfor the operation of the cell. The cell also becomes comatose when themembrane’s receptor proteins are left intact and its effector proteins areimmobilized.To exhibit “intelligent” behavior, cells need a functioning membrane with bothreceptor (awareness) and effector (action) proteins. These protein complexes arethe fundamental units of cellular intelligence. Technically they may be referredto as units of “perception.” The definition of perception is “awareness of theelements of environment through physical sensation.” The first part of thedefinition describes the function of receptor IMPs. The second part of thedefinition, the creation of a “physical sensation,” sums up the role of theeffector proteins.By examining these basic units of perception, we have engaged in an ultimatereductionist exercise, taking the cell down to its fundamental nuts and bolts.In this regard it is important to note that at any given time there are up tohundreds of thousands of such switches in a cell membrane. Consequently, thebehavior of a cell cannot be determined by examining any individual switch. Thebehavior of a cell can only be understood by considering the activities of allthe switches at any given time. That is a holistic—not reductionist—approach,which I’ll elaborate on in the next chapter.At the cellular level, the story of evolution is largely the story of maximizingthe number of basic units of “intelligence,” the membrane’s receptor/effectorproteins. Cells became smarter by utilizing their outer membrane surface moreefficiently and by expanding the surface area of their membranes so that moreIMPs could be packed in. In primitive prokaryote organisms, the IMPs carry outall of its fundamental physiologic functions including digestion, respiration,and excretion. Later in evolution, portions of the membrane that carry out thesephysiologic functions go inside, forming the membranous organelles that arecharacteristic of eukaryotic cytoplasm. That leaves more membrane surface areaavailable to increase the number of perception IMPs. In addition, the eukaryoteis thousands of times bigger than the prokaryote resulting in a tremendousincrease in membrane surface area, i.e., a whole lot more room for IMPs. The endresult is more awareness, which translates to greater survivability.Through evolution, the cell membrane’s surface expanded, but there was aphysical limit to that expansion. There was a point at which the thin cellmembrane was not strong enough to contain a larger mass of cytoplasm. Think whathappens when you fill a balloon with water. As long as the balloon is notoverfilled, it is strong and can be passed around. However, if you exceed theballoon’s water capacity, the balloon ruptures easily, spilling its contents,just as a membrane with too much cytoplasm would inevitably rupture. When thecell membrane reached that critical size, the evolution of the individual cellreached its limit. That’s why for the first three billion years of evolution,single cells were the only organisms on this planet. That situation changed onlywhen cells came up with another way to increase awareness. In order to getsmarter, cells started banding together with other cells to form multicellularcommunities through which they could share their awareness, as I explained inChapter 1.To review, the functions required for a single cell to stay alive are the samefunctions required by a community of cells to stay alive. But cells started tospecialize when they formed multicel-lular organisms. In multicellularcommunities, there is a division of labor. That division of labor is evident inthe tissues and organs that carry out specialized functions. For example, in thesingle cell, respiration is carried out by the mitochondria. In a multicel-lularorganism, the mitochrondrial equivalent for respiration are the billions ofspecialized cells that form the lungs. Here’s another example: In the singlecell, movement is created by the interaction of cytoplasmic proteins calledactin and myosin. In a multicellular organism, communities of specialized musclecells handle the job of generating motility, each endowed with massivequantities of actin and myosin proteins.I repeat this information from the first chapter because I want to emphasizethat while it is the job of the membrane in a single cell to be aware of theenvironment and set in motion an appropriate response to that environment, inour bodies those functions have been taken over by a specialized group of cellswe call the nervous system.Though we’ve come a long way from unicellular organisms, I believe, as I’vementioned before, that studying single cells is an instructive way of studyingcomplicated multicellular organisms. Even the most complex human organ, thebrain, will reveal its secrets more readily when we know as much as we can aboutthe membrane, the cell’s equivalent of a brain.The Secret of LifeAs you’ve learned in this chapter, scientists have recently made great progresstoward unraveling the complexity of the simple-looking membrane. But even twentyyears ago, the rough outlines of the membrane’s functions were known. In fact,it was twenty years ago when I first realized how understanding the workings ofthe membrane could be life changing. My eureka moment resembled the dynamics ofsuper-saturated solutions in chemistry. These solutions, which look like plainwater, are fully saturated with a dissolved substance. They are so saturatedthat just one more drop of the solute causes a dramatic reaction in which all ofthe dissolved materials instantly coalesce into a giant crystal.In 1985, I was living in a rented house on the spice-drenched Caribbean islandof Grenada teaching at yet another “off-shore” medical school. It was 2 a.m.,and I was up revisiting years of notes on the biology, chemistry, and physics ofthe cell membrane. At the time I was reviewing the mechanics of the membrane,trying to get a grasp of how it worked as an information processing system. Thatis when I experienced a moment of insight that transformed me, not into acrystal, but into a membrane-centered biologist who no longer had any excusesfor messing up his life.At that early morning hour, I was redefining my understanding of the structuralorganization of the membrane. Staring first with the lollipop-like phospholipidmolecules and noting that they arranged in the membrane like regimented soldierson parade in perfect alignment. By definition, a structure whose molecules arearranged in regular, repeated pattern is defined as a crystal. There are twofundamental types of crystals. The crystals that most people are familiar withare hard and resilient minerals like diamonds, rubies, and even salt. The secondkind of crystal has a more fluid structure even though its molecules maintain anorganized pattern. Familiar examples of liquid crystals include digital watchfaces and laptop computer screens.To better understand the nature of a liquid crystal, let’s go back to thosesoldiers on parade. When the marching soldiers turn a corner, they maintaintheir regimented structure, even though they’re moving individually. They’rebehaving like a flowing liquid, yet they do not lose their crystallineorganization. The phospholipid molecules of the membrane behave in a similarfashion. Their fluid crystalline organization allows the membrane to dynamicallyalter its shape while maintaining its integrity, a necessary property for asupple membrane barrier. So in defining this character of the membrane I wrote:“The membrane is a liquid crystal.”Then I started thinking about the fact that a membrane with just phospholipidswould be simply a bread-and-butter sandwich without the olives. In theexperiment described earlier, the colored dye could not get through the lipidbutter layer. That bread and butter sandwich is a non-conductor. However, whenyou include the IMP “olives,” you realize that the membrane conducts some thingsacross while keeping other things out. So I continued writing my description ofthe membrane by adding: “The membrane is a semiconductor.”Lastly, I wanted to include in my description the two most common kinds of IMPs.These are the receptors and a class of effectors called channels because theyprovide the all-important means for the cell to let in nutrients and let outwaste matter. I was about to write that the membrane contains “receptors andchannels” when I realized that a synonym for receptor is the word gate. Soinstead I completed my description by writing: “The membrane contains gates andchannels.”I sat back and reviewed my new description of the membrane: “The membrane is aliquid crystal semiconductor with gates and channels.” What hit me right awaywas the fact that I had recently heard or read the very same phrase, though atthe moment, I didn’t know where I had come across it. One thing was for sure; itwas not in the context of biological science.As I leaned back in my chair, my attention was drawn to the corner of my deskwhere my new, smiley-face Macintosh, my first computer, was parked. Lying besidethe computer was a copy of a bright red book called Understanding YourMicroprocessor. I had just bought this non-technical paperback guide to howcomputers work from a Radio Shack outlet. I grabbed the book and found in theintroduction a definition of a computer chip that read: “A chip is a crystalsemiconductor with gates and channels.”For the first second or two I was struck by the fact that the chip and cellmembrane shared the same technical definition. I spent several more intenseseconds comparing and contrasting biomem-branes with silicon semiconductors. Iwas momentarily stunned when I realized that the identical nature of theirdefinitions was not a coincidence. The cell membrane was indeed a structural andfunctional equivalent (homologue) of a silicon chip!Twelve years later an Australian research consortium headed by B. A. Cornellpublished an article in Nature that confirmed my hypothesis that the cellmembrane is a homologue of a computer chip. (Cornell, et al, 1997) Theresearchers isolated a cell membrane and attached a piece of gold foil under it.They then flooded the space between the gold foil and the attached membrane witha special electrolyte solution. When the membrane’s receptors were stimulated bya complementary signal, the channels opened and allowed the electrolyte solutionacross the membrane. The foil served as a transducer, an electrical pickupdevice, which converted the electrical activity of the channel into a digitalreadout on a screen. This device, created for the study, demonstrates that thecell membrane not only looks like a chip but also functions like one. Cornelland associates successfully turned a biological cell membrane into adigital-readout computer chip.So what’s the big deal, you ask? The fact that the cell membrane and a computerchip are homologues means that it is both appropriate and instructive to betterfathom the workings of the cell by comparing it to a personal computer. Thefirst big-deal insight that comes from such an exercise is that computers andcells are programmable. The second corollary insight is that the programmer liesoutside the computer/cell. Biological behavior and gene activity are dynamicallylinked to information from the environment, which is downloaded into the cell.As I conjured up a biocomputer, I realized that the nucleus is simply a memorydisk, a hard drive containing the DNA programs that encode the production ofproteins. Let’s call it the Double Helix Memory Disk. In your home computer youcan insert such a memory disk containing a large number of specialized programslike word processing, graphics, and spreadsheets. After you download thoseprograms into active memory, you can remove the disk from the computer withoutinterfering with the program that is running. When you remove the Double HelixMemory Disk by removing the nucleus, the work of the cellular protein machinegoes on because the information that created the protein machine has alreadybeen downloaded. Enucleated cells get into trouble only when they need the geneprograms in the ejected Double Helix Memory Disk to replace old proteins or makedifferent proteins.I had been trained as a nucleus-centered biologist as surely as Copernicus hadbeen trained as an Earth-centered astronomer, so it was with a jolt that Irealized that the gene-containing nucleus does not program the cell. Data isentered into the cell/computer via the membrane’s receptors, which represent thecell’s “keyboard.” Receptors trigger the membrane’s effector proteins, which actas the cell/computer’s “Central Processing Unit” (CPU). The CPU effectorproteins convert environmental information into the behavioral language ofbiology.I realized in those early morning hours that even though biological thought isstill preoccupied with genetic determinism, leading-edge cell research, whichcontinues to unfold the mystery of the Magical Membrane in ever more complexdetail, tells a far different story.At that moment of transformation, I was frustrated because there was no one withwhom I could share my excitement. I was alone out in the country. My housedidn’t have a telephone. Because I was teaching at a medical school, I realizedthat there would undoubtedly be some students studying in the library. I hastilythrew some clothes on and raced off to the school to tell someone, anyone, ofthis exciting new insight.Running into the library, out of breath, wild-eyed with my hair flying in alldirections, I was the epitome of the absent-minded professor. I spotted one ofmy first-year medical students and ran up to him proclaiming, “You have to hearthis! This is great shit!” I remember in the back of my mind how he pulled awayfrom me, almost in fear of this raving, mad scientist who wildly broke thesilence of the sleepy library. I immediately began to spew forth my newunderstanding of the cell, using the complex, polysyllabic jargon of aconventional cell biologist. When I finished my explanation and was silent, Iwas waiting to hear his congratulations or at least a “bravo,” but nothing wasforthcoming. He was now wide-eyed himself. All he could say was, “Are you okay,Dr. Lipton?”I was crushed. The student had not understood a word I had said. In hindsight, Irealized that as a first-semester medical student, he did not have enoughscientific background or vocabulary to make any sense out of my apparentrantings. However, the wind was knocked out of my sails. I held the key to thesecret of life, and there was no one who could understand me! I confess I didn’thave much better luck with most of my colleagues who had been schooled inpolysyllabic jargon. So much for the Magical Membrane.Over the years I gradually honed my presentation about the Magical Membrane andcontinued to refine it so that first-year medical students and lay people canunderstand it. I’ve also continued to update it with the latest research. In sodoing, I’ve found much more receptive audiences among a wider range of people. Ihave also found audiences receptive to the spiritual implications of my eurekamoment. Shifting to membrane-centered biology was exciting for me, but itwouldn’t have been enough to send me screaming to the library. That Caribbeanmoment not only transformed me into a membrane-centered biologist, it alsotransformed me from an agnostic scientist into a card-carrying mystic whobelieves that eternal life transcends the body.I’ll get to the spiritual part of the story in the Epilogue. For the moment, letme reiterate the lessons of the Magical Membrane, which put the control of ourlives not in the genetic roll of the dice at conception but in our own hands. Weare the drivers of our own biology, just as I am the driver of this wordprocessing program. We have the ability to edit the data we enter into ourbiocomputers, just as surely as I can choose the words I type. When weunderstand how IMPs control biology, we become masters of our fate, not victimsof our genes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d41154981]-1743748017 [images/9781401923112_0094_002.jpg]THE NEW PHYSICS:Planting Both FeetFirmly on Thin AirWhen I was an ambitious undergraduate biology major in the 1960s, I knew that tohave a prayer of getting into a prestigious graduate school I needed to take aphysics course. My college offered a basic introductory course, something likePhysics 101, which covered fundamental topics like gravity, electromagnetism,acoustics, pulleys, and incline planes in a way that was easily understood bynon-physics majors. There was also another course called Quantum Physics, butalmost all of my peers avoided it like the plague. Quantum physics was shroudedin mystery—we biology majors were convinced that it was a very, very “weird”science. We thought only physics majors, masochists, and outright fools wouldrisk five credits on a course whose premise was: “Now you see it. Now youdon’t.”In those days the only reason I would have been able to come up with for takinga quantum physics course was that it would have served as a great pickup line atparties. In the days of Sonny and Cher it would have been très chic to say,“Hey, babe, I’m into quantum physics. What sign are you?” On the other hand,even that might not be true—I never saw quantum physicists at parties or, infact, anywhere else. I don’t think they got out much.So I reviewed my transcripts, weighed the options, and took the easy way out byselecting Physics 101. I was intent on becoming a biologist. I had no interestin having my career aspirations depend on some slide-rule-slinging physicistsinging the praises of ephemeral bosons and quarks. I and virtually every otherbiology major either paid little attention to or completely ignored quantumphysics as we pursued our studies in the life sciences.Unsurprisingly, given our attitude, we biology majors didn’t know much aboutphysics, the one with all the equations and mathematics. I knew aboutgravity—heavy things tend to end up at the bottom and lighter things on top. Iknew something about light—plant pigments such as chlorophyll and animal visualpigments such as the rhodopsin in the retina, absorb some colors of light andare “blind” to others. I even knew a little about temperature—high temperaturesinactivate biological molecules by causing them to “melt” and low temperaturesfreeze and preserve molecules. I am obviously exaggerating to stress the pointthat biologists traditionally don’t know much physics.My quantum-physics-deprived background explains why, even when I rejectednucleus-based biology and turned to the membrane, I still didn’t understand thefull implications of that shift. I knew that integral membrane proteins hook upwith environmental signals to power the cell. But because I didn’t know anythingabout the quantum universe, I did not fully appreciate the nature of theenvironmental signals that start the process.It wasn’t until 1982, more than a decade after I had finished graduate school,that I finally learned how much I had missed when I skipped quantum physics incollege. I believe that had I been introduced to the quantum world in college, Iwould have turned into a biology renegade much earlier. But on that day in 1982,I was sitting on the floor of a warehouse in Berkeley, California, 1,500 milesfrom home, lamenting the fact that I had seriously compromised my scientificcareer on a failed attempt to produce a rock ‘n’ roll show. The crew and I werestranded—we had run out of money after six shows. I had no cash and whenever Ioffered my credit card, the merchant’s credit approval machine displayed a skulland crossbones. We were living on coffee and doughnuts while we proceededthrough Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grieving, over the death of ourshow: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and, finally, acceptance.(Kübler-Ross 1997) But at that moment of acceptance, the silence in thatdarkened concrete tomb of a warehouse was broken by the piercing, electronicscreech of a telephone. Despite the phone’s incessant, obnoxious signal, thecrew and I ignored the caller. It wasn’t for us—no one knew where we were.Finally the manager of the warehouse retrieved the call and restored the blessedsilence. In the quiet, still air, I heard the manager respond, “Yes, he’s here.”I looked up at that moment, from the darkest depth of my life, and saw the phonebeing extended toward me. It was the Caribbean-based medical school that hadhired me two years earlier. The president of the school had spent two daystracking my erratic trail from Wisconsin to California so he could ask me if Iwould be interested in teaching anatomy again.Would I be interested? Does a bear relieve himself in the woods? “How soon doyou want me?” was my reply. He said, “Yesterday.” I told him I would love thejob but needed an advance on my salary. The school wired the money that sameday, and I split the proceeds with my crew. I then flew back to Madison toprepare for an extended stay in the tropics. I bid farewell to my daughters andhastily packed my clothes and a few household items. Within twenty-four hours Iwas back at O’Hare Airport waiting for Pan Am’s Clipper Ship to the Garden ofEden.By now you’re no doubt wondering what my failed rock ‘n’ roll career has to dowith quantum physics—welcome to my unorthodox lecturing style! For thelinear-minded, we’re officially back to quantum physics, through which I wasdelighted to learn that scientists cannot understand the mysteries of theuniverse using only linear thinking.Listening to the Inner VoiceWhile I was waiting for the flight, I realized suddenly that I had nothing toread while strapped into a seat for five hours. Moments before the gate was toclose, I left the line and ran down the concourse to a bookstore. The task ofselecting one book out of hundreds of choices, while simultaneously envisioningthe possibility that my plane’s doors would close and leave me behind, almostparalyzed me. In a state of confusion, one book jumped out at me, The CosmicCode: Quantum Physics as the Language of Nature by physicist Heinz R. Pagels.(Pagels 1982) I quickly scanned the jacket and found that it was a quantumphysics text written for the lay audience. Stubbornly adhering to the quantumphysics phobia I had displayed since college, I immediately put the book downand began to search for something lighter.As the secondhand on my mental stopwatch entered into the red zone, I picked upa self-proclaimed best seller and ran to the cashier. While the clerk waspreparing to ring up the best seller, I looked up and saw another copy ofPagels’s book on the shelf behind the clerk. Midway through the checkoutprocess, with time running out, I finally broke through my aversion to quantumphysics and asked the clerk to add a copy of The Cosmic Code.After I boarded the plane, I calmed down from my adrenalized trip to thebookstore, worked on a crossword puzzle, and then finally settled down to readPagels’s book. I found myself burning through its pages, even though I had tocontinually back up and read sections over again and again. I read through theflight, the three-hour layover in Miami, and an additional five hours en routeto my island paradise. Pagels was completely blowing me away!Before boarding the plane in Chicago, I had no idea that quantum physics was inany way relevant to biology, the science of living organisms. When the planearrived in Paradise, I was in a state of intellectual shock. I realized thatquantum physics is relevant to biology and that biologists are committing aglaring, scientific error by ignoring its laws. Physics, after all, is thefoundation for all the sciences, yet we biologists rely on the outmoded, albeittidier, Newtonian version of how the world works. We stick to the physical worldof Newton and ignore the invisible quantum world of Einstein, in which matter isactually made up of energy and there are no absolutes. At the atomic level,matter does not even exist with certainty; it only exists as a tendency toexist. All my certitudes about biology and physics were shattered!In retrospect, it should have been obvious to me and to other biologists thatNewtonian physics, as elegant and reassuring as it is to hyper-rationalscientists, cannot offer the whole truth about the human body, let alone theuniverse. Medical science keeps advancing, but living organisms stubbornlyrefuse to be quantified. Discovery after discovery about the mechanics ofchemical signals, including hormones, cytokines (hormones that control theimmune system), growth factors, and tumor suppressors, cannot explain paranormalphenomena. Spontaneous healings, psychic phenomena, amazing feats of strengthand endurance, the ability to walk across hot coals without getting burned,acupuncture’s ability to diminish pain by moving “chi” around the body, and manyother paranormal phenomena defy Newtonian biology.Of course, I considered none of that when I was on medical school faculties. Mycolleagues and I trained our students to disregard the healing claims attributedto acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, prayer, etc. In fact, we wentfurther. We denounced these practices as the rhetoric of charlatans because wewere tethered to a belief in old-style, Newtonian physics. The healingmodalities I just mentioned are all based on the belief that energy fields areinfluential in controlling our physiology and our health.The Illusion of MatterOnce I finally grappled with quantum physics, I realized that when we socavalierly dismissed those energy-based practices, we were acting as myopicallyas the chairman of the physics department at Harvard University, who, asdescribed in The Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav, warned students in 1893that there was no need for new Ph.D.’s in physics. (Zukav 1979) He boasted thatscience had established that the universe is a “matter machine” made up ofphysical, individual atoms that fully obey the laws of Newtonian mechanics. Forphysicists, the only work left was to refine its measurements.Three short years later, the notion that the atom was the smallest particle inthe universe fell by the wayside with the discovery that the atom itself is madeup of even smaller, subatomic elements. Even more earth-shattering than thediscovery of those subatomic particles was the revelation that atoms emitvarious “strange energies” such as x-rays and radioactivity. At the turn of thetwentieth century, a new breed of physicist evolved whose mission was to probethe relationship between energy and the structure of matter. Within another tenyears, physicists abandoned their belief in a Newtonian, material universebecause they had come to realize that the universe is not made of mattersuspended in empty space but energy.Quantum physicists discovered that physical atoms are made up of vortices ofenergy that are constantly spinning and vibrating; each atom is like a wobblyspinning top that radiates energy. Because each atom has its own specific energysignature (wobble), assemblies of atoms (molecules) collectively radiate theirown identifying energy patterns. So every material structure in the universe,including you and me, radiates a unique energy signature.If it were theoretically possible to observe the composition of an actual atomwith a microscope, what would we see? Imagine a swirling dust devil cuttingacross the desert’s floor. Now remove the sand and dirt from the funnel cloud.What you have left is an invisible, tornado-like vortex. A number ofinfinitesimally small, dust devil–like energy vortices called quarks and photonscollectively make up the structure of the atom. From far away, the atom wouldlikely appear as a blurry sphere. As its structure came nearer to focus, theatom would become less clear and less distinct. As the surface of the atom drewnear, it would disappear. You would see nothing. In fact, as you focused throughthe entire structure of the atom, all you would observe is a physical void. Theatom has no physical structure—the emperor has no clothes!Remember the atomic models you studied in school, the ones with marbles and ballbearings going around like the solar system? Let’s put that picture beside the“physical” structure of the atom discovered by quantum physicists.-1743747745 [images/9781401923112_0099_005.jpg]No, there has not been a printing mistake; atoms are made out of invisibleenergy not tangible matter!So in our world, material substance (matter) appears out of thin air. Kind ofweird, when you think about it. Here you are holding this physical book in yourhands. Yet if you were to focus on the book’s material substance with an atomicmicroscope, you would see that you are holding nothing. As it turns out, weundergraduate biology majors were right about one thing—the quantum universe ismind-bending.Let’s look more closely at the “now you see it, now you don’t” nature of quantumphysics. Matter can simultaneously be defined as a solid (particle) and as animmaterial force field (wave). When scientists study the physical properties ofatoms, such as mass and weight, they look and act like physical matter. However,when the same atoms are described in terms of voltage potentials andwavelengths, they exhibit the qualities and properties of energy (waves).(Hackermüller, et al, 2003; Chapman, et al, 1995; Pool 1995) The fact thatenergy and matter are one and the same is precisely what Einstein recognizedwhen he concluded that E = mc2. Simply stated, this equation reveals that energy(E) = matter (m, mass) multiplied by the speed of light squared (c2). Einsteinrevealed that we do not live in a universe with discrete, physical objectsseparated by dead space. The Universe is one indivisible, dynamic whole in whichenergy and matter are so deeply entangled it is impossible to consider them asindependent elements.They Are Not Side Effects … They’re Effects!The awareness that such profoundly different mechanics control the structure andbehavior of matter should have offered biomedicine new insights intounderstanding health and disease. Yet even after the discoveries of quantumphysics, biologists and medical students continue to be trained to view the bodyonly as a physical machine that operates in accordance with Newtonianprinciples. In seeking knowledge of how the body’s mechanisms are “controlled,”researchers have focused their attention on investigating a large variety ofphysical signals, classified into discrete chemical families, includingaforementioned hormones, cytokines, growth factors, tumor suppressors,messengers, and ions. However, because of their Newtonian, materialistic bias,conventional researchers have completely ignored the role that energy plays inhealth and disease.In addition, conventional biologists are reductionists who believe thatmechanisms of our physical bodies can be understood by taking the cells apartand studying their chemical building blocks. They believe that the biochemicalreactions responsible for life are generated through Henry Ford–styled assemblylines: one chemical causes a reaction, followed by another reaction with adifferent chemical, etc. The linear flow of information from A to B to C to D toE is illustrated on the following page.This reductionist model suggests that if there is a problem in the system,evident as a disease or dysfunction, the source of the problem can be attributedto a malfunction in one of the steps along the chemical assembly line. Byproviding the cell with a functional replacement part for the faulty element, byprescribing pharmaceutical drugs for example, the defective single point cantheoretically be repaired and health restored. This assumption spurs thepharmaceutical industry’s search for magic-bullet drugs and designer genes.However, the quantum perspective reveals that the universe is an integration ofinterdependent energy fields that are entangled in a meshwork of interactions.Biomedical scientists have been particularly confounded because they do notrecognize the massive complexity of the intercommunication among the physicalparts and the energy fields that make up the whole. The reductionist’sperception of a linear flow of information is a characteristic of the Newtonianuniverse.In contrast, the flow of information in a quantum universe is holistic. Cellularconstituents are woven into a complex web of crosstalk, feedback, andfeedforward communication loops (see illustration next page). A biologicaldysfunction may arise from a miscommunication along any of the routes ofinformation flow. To adjust the chemistry of this complicated interactive systemrequires a lot more understanding than just adjusting one of the informationpathway’s components with a drug. If you change the concentration of C forexample, it doesn’t just influence the action of D. Via holistic pathways,variations in the concentration of C profoundly influence the behaviors andfunctions of A, B, and E, as well as D.-1743747653 [images/9781401923112_0102_002.jpg]Once I realized the nature of the complex interactions between matter andenergy, I knew that a reductionist, linear (A>B>C>D>E) approach could not evencome close to giving us an accurate understanding of disease. While quantumphysics implied the existence of such interconnected information pathways,recent groundbreaking research in mapping protein-protein interactions in thecell now demonstrates the physical presence of these complex holistic pathways.(Li, et al, 2004; Giot, et al, 2003; Jansen, et al, 2003) The illustration onpage 74 shows the interactions among a few of the proteins in a fruit fly cell.Connecting lines represent protein-protein interactions.Clearly, biological dysfunctions can result from miscommunication anywherewithin these complex pathways. When you change the parameters of a protein atone point in such a complex pathway, you inevitably alter the parameters ofother proteins at innumerable points within the entangled networks. In addition,take a look at the seven circles in the next illustration that group proteinsaccording to their physiologic functions. Notice that proteins within onefunctional group, such as those concerned with sex determination (arrow), alsoinfluence proteins with a completely different function, like RNA synthesis(i.e., RNA helicase). Newtonian research scientists have not fully appreciatedthe extensive interconnectivity among the cell’s biological informationnetworks.-1743747645 [images/9781401923112_0103_002.jpg]Map of interactions among a very small set of the cellular proteins (shaded andnumbered circles) found in a Drosophila (fruit fly) cell. Most of the proteinsare associated with the synthesis and metabolism of RNA molecules. Proteinsenclosed within ovals are grouped according to specific pathway functions.Connecting lines indicate protein-protein interactions. Protein interconnectionsamong the different pathways reveal how interfering with one Protein may produceprofound “side effects” upon other related pathways. More wide spread “sideeffects” may be generated when a common protein is utilized in completelydifferent functions. For example, the same Rbp1 protein (arrow) is used in RNAmetabolism as well as in pathways associated with sex determination. Reprintedwith permission from Science 302:1727-1736. Copyright 2003 AAAS.The mapping of these information network pathways underscores the dangers ofprescription drugs. We can now see why pharmaceutical drugs come withinformation sheets listing voluminous side effects that range from irritating todeadly. When a drug is introduced into the body to treat a malfunction in oneprotein, that drug inevitably interacts with at least one and possibly manyother proteins.Complicating the drug side-effect issue is also the fact that biological systemsare redundant. The same signals or protein molecules may be simultaneously usedin different organs and tissues where they provide for completely differentbehavioral functions. For example, when a drug is prescribed to correct adysfunction in a signaling pathway of the heart, that drug is delivered by theblood to the entire body. This “cardiac” medicine can unintentionally disturbthe function of the nervous system if the brain also uses components of thetargeted signaling pathway. While this redundancy complicates the effects ofprescription drugs, it is another remarkably efficient result of evolution.Multicellular organisms can survive with far fewer genes than scientists oncethought because the same gene products (protein) are used for a variety offunctions. This is similar to using the twenty-six letters of the alphabet toconstruct every word in our language.In my research on human blood vessel cells, I experienced firsthand the limitsimposed by redundant signaling pathways. In the body, histamine is an importantchemical signal that initiates the cells’ stress response. When histamine ispresent in the blood that nourishes the arms and legs, the stress signalproduces large gaping pores in the walls of the blood vessels. The opening ofthese holes in the blood vessel’s wall is the first step in launching a localinflammatory reaction. However, if histamine is added to blood vessels in thebrain, the same histamine signal increases the flow of nutrition to the neurons,enhancing their growth and specialized functions. In times of stress, theincreased nutrition signaled by histamine enables the brain to ramp up itsactivity in order to better deal with the perceived impending emergency. This isan example of how the same histamine signal can create two diametrically opposedeffects, depending on the site where the signal is released. (Lipton, et al,1991)One of the most ingenious characteristics of the body’s sophisticated signalingsystem is its specificity. If you have a poison ivy rash on your arm, therelentless itchiness results from the release of histamine, the signal moleculethat activates an inflammatory response to the ivy’s allergen. Since there is noneed to start itching all over your body, the histamine is only released at thesite of the rash. Similarly, when a person is confronted with a stressful lifeexperience, the release of histamine within the brain increases blood flow tothe nervous tissues, enhancing the neurological processing required forsurvival. The release of histamine in the brain to deal with stress behaviors isrestricted and does not lead to the initiation of inflammation responses inother parts of the body. Like the National Guard, histamine is deployed onlywhere it is needed and for as long as it is needed.But most of the medical industry’s drugs have no such specificity. When you takean antihistamine to deal with the itchiness of an allergic rash, the ingesteddrug is distributed systemically. It affects histamine receptors wherever theyare located throughout the whole body. Yes, the antihistamine will curb theblood vessels’ inflammatory response, dramatically reducing allergic symptoms.However, when the antihistamine enters the brain, it inadvertently alters neuralcirculation that then impacts nerve function. That’s why people who takeover-the-counter antihistamines may experience allergy relief and also the sideeffect of feeling drowsy.A recent example of tragic adverse reactions to drug therapy is the debilitatingand life-threatening side effects associated with synthetic hormone replacementtherapy (HRT). Estrogen’s best-known influence is on the function of the femalereproductive system. However, more recent studies on the distribution ofestrogen receptors in the body reveal that they, and of course theircomplementary estrogen signal molecules, play an important role in the normalfunction of blood vessels, the heart, and the brain. Doctors have routinelyprescribed synthetic estrogen to alleviate menopausal symptoms associated withthe shutting-down of a woman’s reproductive system. However, pharmaceuticalestrogen therapy does not focus the drug’s effects on the intended targettissues. The drug also impacts and disturbs the estrogen receptors of the heart,the blood vessels, and the nervous system. Synthetic hormone replacement therapyhas been shown to have disturbing side effects that result in cardiovasculardisease and neural dysfunctions such as strokes. (Shumaker, et al, 2003;Wassertheil-Smoller, et al, 2003; Anderson, et al, 2003; Cauley, et al, 2003)Adverse drug effects, like those contributing to the HRT controversy, are aprimary reason why a leading cause of death is iatrogenic illness, i.e., illnessresulting from medical treatment. According to conservative estimates publishedin the Journal of the American Medical Association, iatrogenic illness is thethird-leading cause of death in this country. More than 120,000 people die fromadverse effects of prescribed medications each year. (Starfield 2000) However,last year a new study, based on the results of a ten-year survey of governmentstatistics, came up with even more dismal figures. (Null, et al, 2003) Thatstudy concludes that iatrogenic illness is actually the leading cause of deathin the United States and that adverse reactions to prescription drugs areresponsible for more than 300,000 deaths a year.These are dismaying statistics, especially for a healing profession that hasarrogantly dismissed three thousand years of effective Eastern medicine asunscientific, even though it is based on a deeper understanding of the universe.For thousands of years, long before Western scientists discovered the laws ofquantum physics, Asians have honored energy as the principal factor contributingto health and wellbeing. In Eastern medicine, the body is defined by anelaborate array of energy pathways called meridians. In Chinese physiologiccharts of the human body, these energy networks resemble electronic wiringdiagrams. Using aids like acupuncture needles, Chinese physicians test theirpatient’s energy circuits in exactly the same manner that electrical engineers“troubleshoot” a printed-circuit board, searching for electrical “pathologies.”Physicians: The Pharmaceutical PatsiesBut as admiring as I am of the ancient wisdom of Eastern medicine, I do not wantto bash Western doctors who prescribe massive quantities of drugs thatcontribute to the health profession’s lethality. Medical doctors are caughtbetween an intellectual rock and a corporate hard place; they are pawns in thehuge medical industrial complex. Their healing abilities are hobbled by anarchaic medical education founded on a Newtonian, matter-only universe.Unfortunately, that philosophy went out of vogue seventy-five years ago, whenphysicists officially adopted quantum mechanics and recognized that the universeis actually made out of energy.In their postgraduate years, those same doctors receive their continuingeducation about pharmaceutical products from drug reps, the errand boys of thecorporate healthcare industry. Essentially, these nonprofessionals, whoseprimary goal is to sell product, provide doctors with “information” about theefficacy of new drugs. Drug companies freely offer this “education” so they canpersuade doctors to “push” their products. It is evident that the massivequantities of drugs prescribed in this country violate the Hippocratic Oathtaken by all doctors to “First do no harm.” We have been programmed bypharmaceutical corporations to become a nation of prescription drug–poppingjunkies with tragic results. We need to step back and incorporate thediscoveries of quantum physics into biomedicine so that we can create a new,safer system of medicine that is attuned to the laws of nature.Physics and Medicine: A Day Late and a Dollar ShortThe physical sciences have already embraced quantum physics with sensationalresults. Humanity’s wake-up call to the reality of a quantum universe occurredon August 6, 1945. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima that day demonstratedthe awesome power of applied quantum theory and dramatically ushered in theAtomic Age. On a more constructive note, quantum physics made possible theelectronic miracles that are the foundation of the Information Age. Theapplication of quantum mechanics was directly responsible for the development ofTVs, computers, CAT scans, lasers, rocket ships, and cell phones.But what great and marvelous advances in biomedical sciences can we attribute tothe quantum revolution? Let’s list them in order of their importance:It is a very short list—there haven’t been any.Though I stress the need to apply the principles of quantum mechanics inbioscience, I’m not advocating that medicine throw out the valuable lessons theyhave learned using the principles of Isaac Newton. The newer laws of quantummechanics do not negate the results of classical physics. The planets are stillmoving in paths that were predicted by Newton’s mathematics. The differencebetween the two physics is that quantum mechanics more specifically applies tomolecular and atomic realms while Newtonian laws apply to higher levels oforganization, such as organ systems, people, or populations of people. Themanifestation of a disease, such as cancer, may show up at a macro level whenyou can see and feel a tumor. However, the processes that instigated the cancerwere initiated at the molecular level within the affected progenitor cells. Infact, most biological dysfunctions (except injuries due to physical trauma)start at the level of a cell’s molecules and ions. Hence the need for a biologythat integrates both quantum and Newtonian mechanics.There have, thankfully, been some visionary biologists who have advocated thisintegration. More than forty years ago the renowned Nobel Prize–winningphysiologist Albert Szent-Györgyi published a book called Introduction to aSubmolecular Biology. (Szent-Györgyi 1960) His text was a noble effort toeducate the community of life scientists about the importance of quantum physicsin biological systems. Unfortunately, his traditional peers, who considered thebook to be the ravings of a once brilliant but now senile old man, merelylamented the “loss” of their former colleague. Biologists in the main have stillnot recognized the importance of Szent-Györgyi’s book, but research suggeststhat sooner or later they will have to because the weight of scientific evidenceis toppling the old materialist paradigm. You recall the movements of proteinmolecules that are the stuff of life? Scientists have tried to predict thosemovements using the principles of Newtonian physics, to no avail. By now, I betyou can guess why: in 2000, an article by V. Pophristic and L. Goodman in thejournal Nature revealed that the laws of quantum physics, not Newtonian laws,control a molecule’s life-generating movements. (Pophristic and Goodman 2001)Reviewing this ground-breaking study for Nature, biophysicist F. Weinholdconcluded: “When will chemistry textbooks begin to serve as aids, rather thanbarriers, to this enriched quantum-mechanic perspective on how molecularturnstiles work?” He further emphasized: “What are the forces that control thetwisting and folding of molecules into complex shapes? Don’t look for theanswers in your organic chemistry textbook.” (Weinhold 2001) Yet organicchemistry provides the mechanistic foundation for biomedicine; and as Weinholdnotes, that branch of science is so far out of date that its textbooks have yetto recognize quantum mechanics. Conventional medical researchers have nounderstanding of the molecular mechanisms that truly provide for life.Hundreds upon hundreds of other scientific studies over the last fifty yearshave consistently revealed that “invisible forces” of the electromagneticspectrum profoundly impact every facet of biological regulation. These energiesinclude microwaves, radio frequencies, the visible light spectrum, extremely lowfrequencies, acoustic frequencies, and even a newly recognized form of forceknown as scalar energy. Specific frequencies and patterns of electromagneticradiation regulate DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses; alter protein shape andfunction; and control gene regulation, cell division, cell differentiation,morphogenesis (the process by which cells assemble into organs and tissues),hormone secretion, and nerve growth and function. Each one of these cellularactivities is a fundamental behavior that contributes to the unfolding of life.Though these research studies have been published in some of the most respectedmainstream biomedical journals, their revolutionary findings have not beenincorporated into the medical school curriculum. (Liboff 2004; Goodman and Blank2002; Sivitz 2000; Jin, et al, 2000; Blackman, et al, 1993; Rosen 1992, Blank1992; Tsong 1989; Yen-Patton, et al, 1988)An important study forty years ago by Oxford University biophysicist C. W. F.McClare calculated and compared the efficiency of information transfer betweenenergy signals and chemical signals in biological systems. His research,“Resonance in Bioenergetics,” published in the Annals of the New York Academy ofScience, revealed that energetic signaling mechanisms such as electromagneticfrequencies are a hundred times more efficient in relaying environmentalinformation than physical signals such as hormones, neurotransmitters, growthfactors, etc. (McClare 1974)It is not surprising that energetic signals are so much more efficient. Inphysical molecules, the information that can be carried is directly linked to amolecule’s available energy. However, the chemical coupling employed to transfertheir information is accompanied by a massive loss of energy due to the heatgenerated in making and breaking chemical bonds. Because thermo-chemicalcoupling wastes most of the molecule’s energy, the small amount of energy thatremains limits the amount of information that can be carried as the signal.We know that living organisms must receive and interpret environmental signalsin order to stay alive. In fact, survival is directly related to the speed andefficiency of signal transfer. The speed of electromagnetic energy signals is186,000 miles per second, while the speed of a diffusible chemical isconsiderably less than 1 centimeter per second. Energy signals are 100 timesmore efficient and infinitely faster than physical chemical signaling. What kindof signaling would your trillion-celled community prefer? Do the math!Buying the PharmI believe the major reason why energy research has been all but ignored comesdown to dollars and cents. The trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry puts itsresearch money into the search for magic bullets in the form of chemicalsbecause pills mean money. If energy healing could be made into tablet form, drugmanufacturers would get interested quickly.Instead, they identify deviations in physiology and behavior that vary from somehypothetical norm as unique disorders or dysfunctions, and then they educate thepublic about the dangers of these menacing disorders. Of course, theover-simplified symptomology used in defining the dysfunctions prevalent in drugcompany advertisements has viewers convinced they are afflicted by thatparticular malady. “Do you worry? Worry is a primary symptom of ‘medicalcondition’ called anxiety disorder. Stop your worry. Tell your doctor you wantAddictazac, the new passion-pink drug.”Meanwhile, the media essentially avoids the issue of deaths by medicine bydirecting our attention to the dangers of illicit drugs. They admonish us thatusing drugs to escape life’s problems is not the way to resolve one’s issue.Funny … I was just going to use that exact sentence to describe my concernsabout the overuse of legal drugs. Are they dangerous? Ask the people who diedlast year. Using prescription drugs to silence a body’s symptoms enables us toignore personal involvement we may have with the onset of those symptoms. Theoveruse of prescription drugs provides a vacation from personal responsibility.Our drug mania reminds me of a job at an auto dealership I held while ingraduate school. At 4:30 on a Friday afternoon, an irate woman came into theshop. Her car’s “service engine light” was flashing, even though her car hadalready been repaired for that same problem several times. At 4:30 on a Fridayafternoon, who wants to work on a balky problem and deal with a furiouscustomer? Everyone was quiet, except for one mechanic who said, “I’ll take careof it.” He drove the car back into the bay, got in behind the dashboard, removedthe bulb from the signal light and threw it away. Then he opened a can of sodaand lit a cigarette. After a suitable time, during which the customer thought hewas actually fixing the car, the mechanic returned and told the woman her carwas ready. Thrilled to see that the warning light had stopped flashing, shehappily drove off into the sunset. Though the cause of the problem was stillpresent, the symptom was gone. Similarly, pharmaceutical drugs suppress thebody’s symptoms but most never address the cause of the problem.“Wait,” you say. “Times have changed.” We are now more educated to the dangersof drugs and more open to alternative therapies. It is true that because half ofAmericans visit complementary health practitioners, traditional doctors can nolonger put their heads in the sand and hope other approaches go away. Insurancecompanies have even started to pay for services they once deemed quackery, andmajor teaching hospitals allow a limited number of such practitioners inside.But even today very little scientific rigor has been marshaled to assess theeffectiveness of complementary medicine. The National Institutes of Health didcreate an “alternative medicine” branch, thanks to pressure from the public. Butthat is only a token gesture to quell activists and consumers who spend lots ofmoney on alternative health care. There are no serious research funds availablefor studying energy medicine. The rub is that without supportive research,energy-based healing modalities are officially labeled “unscientific.”Good Vibes, Bad Vibes, and the Language of EnergyThough conventional medicine still has not focused on the role energy plays as“information” in biological systems, ironically, it has embraced noninvasivescanning technologies, which read such energy fields. Quantum physicists havecreated energy-scanning devices that can analyze the frequencies emitted byspecific chemicals. These scanning systems enable scientists to identify themolecular composition of materials and objects. Physicists have adapted thesedevices to read the energy spectra emitted by our body’s tissues and organs.Because energy fields travel easily through the physical body, these moderndevices, such as CAT scans, MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans,can detect disease noninvasively. Physicians are able to diagnose internalproblems by differentiating the spectral energy character of healthy anddiseased tissue in the scanned images.-1743747266 [images/9781401923112_0113_001.jpg]Mammogram. Note the above illustration is not a photograph of a breast, it is anelectronic image created from scanning the radiant energy characteristics of theorgan’s cells and tissues. Differentials in the energy spectra enableradiologists to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues (the black spotin the center).The energy scan illustrated above reveals the presence of breast cancer. Thediseased tissue emits its own unique energy signature, which differs from theenergy emitted by surrounding healthy cells. The energy signatures that passthrough our bodies travel through space as invisible waves that resemble rippleson a pond. If you drop a pebble into a pond, the “energy” carried in the fallingpebble (due to the force of gravity pulling on its mass) is transmitted to thewater. The ripples generated by the pebble are actually energy waves passingthrough the water.If more than one pebble is thrown into the water at the same time, the spreadingripples (energy waves) from each source can interfere with each other, formingcomposite waves where two or more ripples converge. That interference can beeither constructive (energy-amplifying) or destructive (energy-deflating).-1743747241 [images/9781401923112_0114_001.jpg]Dropping two pebbles of the same size, from the same height, and at exactly thesame time, coordinates the wave action of their ripples. The ripples from eachpebble converge on each other. Where the ripples overlap, the combined power ofthe interacting waves is doubled, a phenomenon referred to as constructiveinterference, or harmonic resonance. When the dropping of the pebbles is notcoordinated, their energy waves are out of sync. As one wave is going up, theother is going down. At the point of convergence these out of sync energy wavescancel each other. Instead of a doubling of the energy where the ripplesinterfere with each other, the water is calm … there is no energy wave. Thisphenomenon of canceling energy waves is called destructive interference.-1743747233 [images/9781401923112_0115_001.jpg]Constructive Interference. In 1 above, two sets of ripples are moving across thesurface of water toward each other. As illustrated, both wave A and B are movingtoward each other with their ripples in phase, in this case both waves areleading with their negative amplitude. Their cycle patterns are aligned. Thewaves merge together at the interface where two ripples meet. To illustrate theconsequence of this merger, the waves are drawn with one above the other infigure 2. Where the amplitude of A is +1, the amplitude of B is also +1. Add thetwo together, and the resulting amplitude of the composite wave at that point is+2. Likewise, where A is –1 so is B, together the total amplitude will be –2.The resulting higher amplitude composite wave is illustrated in 3.The behavior of energy waves is important for biomedicine because vibrationalfrequencies can alter the physical and chemical properties of an atom as surelyas physical signals like histamine and estrogen. Because atoms are in constantmotion, which you can measure by their vibration, they create wave patternssimilar to the expanding ripples from the thrown pebbles we talked about above.Each atom is unique because the distribution of its negative and positivecharges, coupled with its spin rate, generates a specific vibration or frequencypattern. (Oschman 2000)-1743747198 [images/9781401923112_0116_001.jpg]Destructive Interference. In figure 1, the ripples derived from first pebble,labeled as Wave A, are moving from left to right. Wave B, moving right to left,represents the ripples from a second pebble dropped shortly after the first.Since the pebbles did not hit the water at the same time, the waves will not bealigned when they merge at the interface, they will be “out of phase.” In theillustration, Wave A is leading with a negative amplitude, and Wave B is leadingwith a positive amplitude. Where they meet in figure 2, the waves aremirror-images of each other, the high amplitude (+1) of one wave is aligned withthe low amplitude (-1) of the other, and vice versa. As shown in 3, theamplitude values of each wave cancel each other out, so that the composite wavehaving 0 amplitude is no wave at all … it’s flat!Scientists have devised a way to stop an atom dead in its tracks by exploitingits energy waves. They first identify the frequency of a specific atom and thentune a laser to emit the same frequency. Though the atom and the photoelectricfrequency emit the same wave pattern, the laser’s waves are designed to be outof sync with those of the atom. When the light wave interacts with the atom’swave, the resulting destructive interference cancels the atom’s vibrations andit stops spinning. (Chu 2002; Rumbles 2001)When you want to enhance rather than stop atoms, you find vibrations that createharmonic resonance. Those vibrations can be of electromagnetic or acousticorigin. When, for example, a skilled vocalist like Ella Fitzgerald maintains anote that is harmonically resonant with the atoms of a crystal goblet, thegoblet’s atoms absorb her sound waves. Through the mechanics of constructiveinterference, the added energy of resonant sound waves causes the goblet’s atomsto vibrate faster. Eventually the atoms absorb so much energy that they vibratefast enough to break free from the bonds that hold them together. When thathappens, the goblet actually explodes.Doctors use constructive interference mechanics to treat kidney stones, a rarecase where the laws of quantum physics have been harnessed as a therapeutic toolin modern medicine. Kidney stones are crystals whose atoms vibrate at a specificfrequency. Doctors non-invasively focus a harmonic frequency on the kidneystone. Constructive interference results when the focused energy waves interactwith the atoms in the kidney stones. Like the atoms in the crystal gobletexample above, the atoms of the kidney stones vibrate so quickly that the stonesexplode and dissolve. The small, remaining fragments can then be easily passedfrom the system without the excruciating pain that accompanies large, unexplodedstones.The science of physics implies that the same harmonic resonance mechanism, bywhich sound waves destroy a goblet or a kidney stone, can enable similar energyharmonics to influence the functions of our body’s chemistry. But biologistshave not explored these mechanisms with the passion with which they pursue newdrugs. That is unfortunate because there is enough scientific evidence tosuspect that we can tailor a waveform as a therapeutic agent in much the sameway we now modulate chemical structures with drugs.There was a time in medicine when electrotherapy was used extensively. At theend of the nineteenth century, the development of batteries and other devicesthat produce electromagnetic fields led to hastily constructed machines thatwere supposed to cure disease. The public sought out practitioners of thisnew-fangled healing art called radioesthesia. Word spread that these deviceswere very effective. In fact, they became so popular that magazines were likelyto tout ads that read something like: “Be a Radioesthe-siast! Only$9.99—includes instructions!” By 1894, over 10,000 U.S. physicians, as well asan untold number of self-trained home consumers, were regularly usingelectrotherapy.In 1895, D.D. Palmer created the science of chiropractic. Palmer recognized thatthe flow of energy through the nervous system is critical to health. He focusedon the mechanics of the vertebral column, the conduit through which spinalnerves provide information to the body. He developed skills to assess and tunethe flow of information by adjusting the backbone’s tensions and pressures.The medical profession became threatened by Palmer’s chiropractors as well ashomeopathic healers, radioesthesiasts, and other drugless practitioners who weretaking away much of their business. The Carnegie Foundation published theFlexner Report in 1910 that called for all medical practices to be based onproven science. Because physicists had not yet discovered the quantum universe,energy medicine was incomprehensible to science. Denounced by the AmericanMedical Association, chiropractic and other energy-based modalities fell intodisrepute. Radioesthesiasts disappeared completely.In the last forty years, chiropractic has made great inroads in the healingarts. In 1990, chiropractors won a lengthy court battle against the medicalmonopoly when the American Medical Association was found guilty of illegalattempts to destroy the profession. Since then, chiropractic has spread itssphere of influence—it is even accepted in some hospitals. And despiteelectrotherapy’s checkered past, neuroscientists are conducting exciting newresearch in the area of vibrational energy therapies.The brain has long been recognized to be an electrical organ, which is whyelectroshock therapy has historically been used to treat depression. Butscientists are now working on less invasive tools to treat the electric brain. Arecent article in Science touted the beneficial effects of transcranial magneticstimulation (TMS), which stimulates the brain with magnetic fields. (Helmuth2001; Hallet 2000) TMS is an updated version of the same 19th centuryradioesthesia healing techniques that were once denounced by conventionalmedicine. New studies suggest that TMS can be a powerful therapeutic tool. Ifused properly, it can ease depression and alter cognition.It is clear that we need interdisciplinary research in this promising andunderstudied area, research that encompasses quantum physics, electricalengineering, chemistry, as well as biology. Such research will be particularlywelcomed because it is likely to result in therapies with far fewer side effectsthan drugs. But the research will only confirm what scientists and nonscientistsalready “know” but may not realize they know: all organisms, including humans,communicate and read their environment by evaluating energy fields. Becausehumans are so dependent on spoken and written language, we have neglected ourenergy sensing communication system. As with any biological function, a lack ofuse leads to atrophy. Interestingly, aborigines still utilize this hyper-sensorycapacity in their daily lives. For them there has been no “sensory” atrophy. Forexample, Australian aborigines can sense water buried deep beneath the sand, andAmazonian shamans communicate with the energies of their medicinal plants.You no doubt on occasion get a glimmer of your ancient sensing mechanism. Haveyou ever walked down a dark street at night and instantly felt drained ofenergy? What were you experiencing? Destructive interference, just likeout-of-sync pebbles thrown into a pond, or, in popular jargon, bad vibes!Remember unexpectedly meeting that special someone in your life and becoming soenergized you felt “high”? You were experiencing constructive interference, orgood vibes.When I gave up my view that we are inert matter, I realized not only that thescience of my chosen career was out of date but also that I needed to promotemore constructive interference in my own life. I needed a personal quantumphysics–inspired tune-up! Rather than focusing on creating harmonic energies inmy life, I was going through life willy-nilly, mindlessly expending energy. Thatis the equivalent of heating a house in the dead of winter while leaving thedoors and windows open. I started closing those doors and windows by carefullyexamining where I was wasting my energy. It was easy for me to close some ofthem. For example, it was easy to get rid of energy-draining activities likethose deadly faculty parties. It was harder to get rid of the energy-drainingdefeatist thinking in which I habitually engaged. Thoughts consume energy assurely as does marathon running, as we’ll see in the next chapter.I needed a quantum tune-up. And so, I’ve made clear, does biomedicine. But as Isaid earlier, we are already in the midst of a very slow shift in medicine,propelled by consumers who are seeking out complementary medicine practitionersin record numbers. It’s been a long time coming, but the quantum biologicalrevolution is nigh. The medical establishment will eventually be dragged, halfkicking and screaming, full force into the quantum revolution."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d41155071]-1743747046 [images/9781401923112_0122_002.jpg]BIOLOGY AND BELIEFIn 1952 a young British physician made a mistake. It was a mistake that was tobring short-lived scientific glory to Dr. Albert Mason. Mason tried to treat afifteen-year-old boy’s warts using hypnosis. Mason and other doctors hadsuccessfully used hypnosis to get rid of warts, but this was an especially toughcase. The boy’s leathery skin looked more like an elephant’s hide than ahuman’s, except for his chest, which had normal skin.Mason’s first hypnosis session focused on one arm. When the boy was in ahypnotic trance, Mason told him that the skin on that arm would heal and turninto healthy, pink skin. When the boy came back a week later, Mason wasgratified to see that the arm looked healthy. But when Mason brought the boy tothe referring surgeon, who had unsuccessfully tried to help the boy with skingrafts, he learned that he had made a medical error. The surgeon’s eyes werewide with astonishment when he saw the boy’s arm. It was then that he told Masonthat the boy was suffering, not from warts, but from a lethal genetic diseasecalled congenital ichthyosis. By reversing the symptoms using “only” the powerof the mind, Mason and the boy had accomplished what had until that time beenconsidered impossible. Mason continued the hypnosis sessions, with the stunningresult that most of the boy’s skin came to look like the healthy, pink arm afterthe first hypnosis session. The boy, who had been mercilessly teased in schoolbecause of his grotesque-looking skin, went on to lead a normal life.When Mason wrote about his startling treatment for ichthyosis in the BritishMedical Journal in 1952, his article created a sensation. (Mason 1952) Mason wastouted in the media and became a magnet for patients suffering from the rare,lethal disease that no one before had ever cured. But hypnosis was in the endnot a cure-all. Mason tried it on a number of other ichthyosis patients, but hewas never able to replicate the results he had had with the young boy. Masonattributes his failure to his own belief about the treatment. When Mason treatedthe new patients he couldn’t replicate his cocky attitude as a young physicianthinking he was treating a bad case of warts. After that first patient, Masonwas fully aware that he was treating what everyone in the medical establishmentknew to be a congenital, “incurable” disease. Mason tried to pretend that he wasupbeat about the prognosis, but he told the Discovery Health Channel, “I wasacting.” (Discovery Health Channel 2003)How is it possible that the mind can override genetic programming, as it did inthe case above? And how could Mason’s belief about that treatment affect itsoutcome? The New Biology suggests some answers to those questions. We saw in thelast chapter that matter and energy are entangled. The logical corollary is thatthe mind (energy) and body (matter) are similarly bound, though Western medicinehas tried valiantly to separate them for hundreds of years.In the seventeenth century, René Descartes dismissed the idea that the mindinfluences the physical character of the body. Descartes’ notion was that thephysical body was made out of matter and the mind was made out of anunidentified but clearly immaterial substance. Because he couldn’t identify thenature of the mind, Descartes left behind an irresolvable philosophicalconundrum: since only matter can affect matter, how can an immaterial mind be“connected” to a material body? The nonphysical mind envisioned by Descartes waspopularly defined as the “Ghost in the Machine” by Gilbert Ryle sixty years agoin his book The Concept of Mind. (Ryle 1949) Traditional biomedicine, whosescience is based on a Newtonian matter-only universe, embraced Descartes’separation of mind and body. Medically speaking, it would be far easier to fix amechanical body without having to deal with its meddling “ghost.”The reality of a quantum universe reconnects what Descartes took apart. Yes, themind (energy) arises from the physical body, just as Descartes thought. However,our new understanding of the universe’s mechanics shows us how the physical bodycan be affected by the immaterial mind. Thoughts, the mind’s energy, directlyinfluence how the physical brain controls the body’s physiology. Thought“energy” can activate or inhibit the cell’s function-producing proteins via themechanics of constructive and destructive interference, described in theprevious chapter. That is why, when I took the first step toward changing mylife, I actively monitored where I was expending my brain’s energy. I had toexamine the consequences of energy I invested in my thoughts as closely as Iexamined the expenditures of energy I used to power my physical body.Despite the discoveries of quantum physics, the mind-body split in Westernmedicine still prevails. Scientists have been trained to dismiss cases like theboy above who used his mind to heal a genetically “mandated” disease, as quirkyanomalies. I believe, on the contrary, that scientists should embrace the studyof these anomalies. Buried in exceptional cases are the roots of a more powerfulunderstanding of the nature of life—“more powerful” because the principlesbehind these exceptions trump established “truths.” The fact is that harnessingthe power of your mind can be more effective than the drugs you have beenprogrammed to believe you need. The research I discussed in the last chapterfound that energy is a more efficient means of affecting matter than chemicals.Unfortunately, scientists most often deny rather than embrace exceptions. Myfavorite example of scientific denial of the reality of mind-body interactionsrelates to an article that appeared in Science about nineteenth-century Germanphysician, Robert Koch, who along with Pasteur founded the Germ Theory. The GermTheory holds that bacteria and viruses are the cause of disease. That theory iswidely accepted now, but in Koch’s day it was more controversial. One of Koch’scritics was so convinced that the Germ Theory was wrong that he brazenly wolfeddown a glass of water laced with vibrio cholerae, the bacterium Koch believedcaused cholera. To everyone’s astonishment, the man was completely unaffected bythe virulent pathogen. The Science article published in 2000 describing theincident stated: “For unexplained reasons he remained symptom free, butnevertheless incorrect.” (DiRita 2000) The man survived and Science, reflectingthe unanimity of opinion on the Germ Theory, had the audacity to say hiscriticism was incorrect? If it is claimed that this bacterium is the cause ofcholera and the man demonstrates that he is unaffected by the germs … how can hebe “incorrect”? Instead of trying to figure out how the man avoided the dreadeddisease, scientists blithely dismiss this and other embarrassing “messy”exceptions that spoil their theories. Remember the “dogma” that genes controlbiology?Here is another example in which scientists, bent on establishing the validityof their truth, ignore pesky exceptions. The problem is that there cannot beexceptions to a theory; exceptions simply mean that a theory is not fullycorrect.A current example of a reality that challenges the established beliefs ofscience concerns the ancient religious practice of fire-walking. Seekers gathertogether daily to stretch the realms of conventional awareness by walking acrossbeds of hot coals. Measurement of the stone’s temperature and duration ofexposure are enough to cause medically relevant burns on the feet, yet thousandsof participants emerge from the process totally unscathed. Before you jump tothe conclusion that the coals were not really that hot, consider the numbers ofparticipants who waver in their beliefs and get scalded walking across the samebed of coals.Similarly, science is unambiguous about its claim that the HIV virus causesAIDS. But it has no conception as to why large numbers of individuals that havebeen infected with the virus for decades do not express the disease? Morebaffling is the reality of terminal cancer patients who have recovered theirlives through spontaneous remissions. Because such remissions are outside thebounds of conventional theory, science completely disregards the fact that theyever happened. Spontaneous remissions are dismissed as unexplainable exceptionsto our current truths or simply, misdiagnoses.When Positive Thinking Goes BadBefore I go on to discuss the incredible power of our minds and how my researchon cells provided insight into how the body’s mind-body pathways work, I need tomake it very clear that I do not believe that simply thinking positive thoughtsalways leads to physical cures. You need more than just “positive thinking” toharness control of your body and your life. It is important for our health andwell-being to shift our mind’s energy toward positive, life-generating thoughtsand eliminate ever-present, energy-draining, and debilitating negative thoughts.But, and I mean that in the biggest sense of “BUT,” the mere thinking ofpositive thoughts will not necessarily have any impact on our lives at all! Infact, sometimes people who “flunk” positive thinking become more debilitatedbecause now they think their situation is hopeless—they believe they haveexhausted all mind and body remedies.What those positive-thinking dropouts haven’t understood is that the seemingly“separate” subdivisions of the mind, the conscious and the subconscious areinterdependent. The conscious mind is the creative one, the one that can conjureup “positive thoughts.” In contrast, the subconscious mind is a repository ofstimulus-response tapes derived from instincts and learned experiences. Thesubconscious mind is strictly habitual; it will play the same behavioralresponses to life’s signals over and over again, much to our chagrin. How manytimes have you found yourself going ballistic over something trivial like anopen toothpaste tube? You have been trained since childhood to carefully replacethe cap. When you find the tube with its cap left off, your “buttons are pushed”and you automatically fly into a rage. You’ve just experienced the simplestimulus-response of a behavior program stored in the subconscious mind.When it comes to sheer neurological processing abilities, the subconscious mindis millions of times more powerful than the conscious mind. If the desires ofthe conscious mind conflict with the programs in the subconscious mind, which“mind” do you think will win out? You can repeat the positive affirmation thatyou are lovable over and over or that your cancer tumor will shrink. But if, asa child, you heard over and over that you are worthless and sickly, thosemessages programmed in your subconscious mind will undermine your best consciousefforts to change your life. Remember how quickly your last New Year’sresolution to eat less food fell by the wayside as the aroma of the bakingturkey dissolved your resolve? We’ll learn more about the origins ofself-sabotaging subconscious programming in Chapter 7, “Conscious Parenting,”and how to quickly rewrite them. But for the moment, be aware that there is hopeeven for those of you who used positive thinking and failed miserably.Mind Over BodyLet’s review what we know about cells. We learned in earlier chapters that thefunctions of cells are directly derived from the movements of their protein“gears.” The movement generated by assemblies of proteins provides thephysiologic functions that enable life. While proteins are the physical buildingblocks, complementary environmental signals are required to animate theirmovement. The interface between environmental signals and behavior-producingcytoplasmic proteins is the cell’s membrane. The membrane receives stimuli andthen engages the appropriate, life-sustaining cellular responses. The cellmembrane operates as the cell’s “brain.” Integral membrane receptor-effectorproteins (IMPs) are the fundamental physical subunits of the cellular brain’s“intelligence” mechanism. By functional definition, these protein complexes are“perception switches” that link reception of environmental stimuli toresponse-generating protein pathways.Cells generally respond to an assortment of very basic “perceptions” of what’sgoing on in their world. Such perceptions include whether things like potassium,calcium, oxygen, glucose, histamine, estrogen, toxins, light, or any number ofother stimuli are present in their immediate environment. The simultaneousinteractions of tens of thousands of reflexive perception switches in themembrane, each directly reading an individual environmental signal, collectivelycreate the complex behavior of a living cell.For the first three billion years of life on this planet, the biosphereconsisted of free-living single cells such as bacteria, algae, and protozoans.While we have traditionally considered such life forms as solitary individuals,we are now aware that signal molecules used by individual cells to regulatetheir own physiologic functions, when released into the environment, alsoinfluence the behavior of other organisms. Signals released into the environmentallow for a coordination of behavior among a dispersed population of unicellularorganisms. Secreting signal molecules into the environment enhanced the survivalof single cells by providing them with the opportunity to live as a primitive“community.”The single-celled slime mold amoebas provide an example of how signalingmolecules lead to community. These amoebas live a solitary existence in the soilforaging for food. When available food in the environment is consumed, the cellssynthesize an excess amount of a metabolic by-product called cyclic AMP (cAMP),much of which is released into the environment. The concentration of thereleased cAMP builds in the environment as other amoebas face starvation. Whensecreted cAMP signal molecules bind to cAMP-receptors on the cell membranes ofother slime mold amoebas, it signals them to activate a swarming behaviorwherein the amoebas congregate and form a large multicellular “slug.” The slugcommunity is the reproductive stage of slime mold. During the “famine” period,the community of aging cells shares their DNA and creates the next generation ofoffspring. The new amoebas hibernate as inactive spores. When more food isavailable, the food molecules act as a signal to break the hibernation,releasing a new population of single cells to start the cycle over again.The point is that single-celled organisms actually live in a community when theyshare their “awareness” and coordinate their behaviors by releasing “signal”molecules into the environment. Cyclic AMP was one of evolution’s earliest formsof secreted regulatory signals that controls cell behavior. The fundamentalhuman signal molecules (e.g., hormones, neuropeptides, cytokines, growthfactors) that regulate our own cellular communities were once thought to havearisen with the appearance of complex multicellular life forms. However, recentresearch has revealed that primitive single-celled organisms were already usingthese “human” signal molecules in the earliest stages of evolution.Through evolution, cells maximized the number of IMP “awareness” proteins theirmembranes could hold. To acquire more awareness, and therefore increase theirprobability of surviving, cells started to assemble, first into simple coloniesand later into highly organized cellular communities. As described earlier, thephysiologic functions of multicellular organisms are parceled out to specializedcommunities of cells forming the body’s tissues and organs. In communalorganizations, the cell membrane’s intelligence processing is carried out by thespecialized cells of the organism’s nervous and immune systems.It was only 700 million years ago, recent in regard to the time frame of life onthis planet, when single cells found it advantageous to join together in tightlyknit multicellular communities, organizations we recognize as animals andplants. The same coordinating signal molecules used by free-living cells wereused in these newly evolved closed communities. By tightly regulating therelease and distribution of these function-controlling signal molecules, thecommunity of cells would be able to coordinate their functions and act as asingle life form. In the more primitive multicellular organisms, those withoutspecialized nervous systems, the flow of these signal molecules within thecommunity provided an elementary “mind,” represented by the coordinatinginformation shared by every cell. In such organisms, each cell directly readenvironmental cues and personally adjusted its own behavior.However, when cells came together in community, a new politic had to beestablished. In community, each cell cannot act as an independent agent thatdoes whatever it wants. The term “community” implies that all of its memberscommit to a common plan of action. In multicellular animals, individual cellsmay “see” the local environment outside of their own “skin,” but they may haveno awareness of what is going on in more distant environments, especially thoseoutside of the whole organism itself. Can a liver cell buried in your viscera,responding to its local environmental signals, make an informed responseregarding the consequence of a mugger that jumps into your environment? Thecomplex behavior controls needed to ensure a multicellular organization’ssurvival are incorporated within its centralized information processing system.As more complex animals evolved, specialized cells took over the job ofmonitoring and organizing the flow of the behavior regulating signal molecules.These cells provided a distributed nerve network and central informationprocessor, a brain. The brain’s function is to coordinate the dialogue of signalmolecules within the community. Consequently, in a community of cells, each cellmust acquiesce control to the informed decisions of its awareness authority, thebrain. The brain controls the behavior of the body’s cells. This is a veryimportant point to consider as we blame the cells of our organs and tissues forthe health issues we experience in our lives.Emotions: Feeling the Language of CellsIn higher, more aware life forms, the brain developed a specialization thatenabled the whole community to tune into the status of its regulatory signals.The evolution of the limbic system provided a unique mechanism that convertedthe chemical communication signals into sensations that could be experienced byall of the cells in the community. Our conscious mind experiences these signalsas emotions. The conscious mind not only “reads” the flow of the cellularcoordinating signals that comprise the body’s “mind” it can also generateemotions, which are manifested through the controlled release of regulatorysignals by the nervous system.At the same time that I was studying the mechanics of the cell’s brain andgaining insight into the operation of the human brain, Candace Pert was studyingthe human brain and becoming aware of the mechanics of the cell’s brain. InMolecules of Emotion, Pert revealed how her study of information-processingreceptors on nerve cell membranes led her to discover that the same “neural”receptors were present on most, if not all, of the body’s cells. Her elegantexperiments established that the “mind” was not focused in the head but wasdistributed via signal molecules to the whole body. As importantly, her workemphasized that emotions were not only derived through a feedback of the body’senvironmental information. Through self-consciousness, the mind can use thebrain to generate “molecules of emotion” and override the system. While properuse of consciousness can bring health to an ailing body, inappropriateunconscious control of emotions can easily make a healthy body diseased, a topicI will expand upon in Chapters 6 and 7. Molecules of Emotion is a veryinsightful book describing the scientific discovery process. It also providessome revealing insights into the struggles encountered when trying to introducenew “ideas” into science’s Old Boys Club, a subject with which I am all toofamiliar! (Pert 1997)The limbic system offered a major evolutionary advance through its ability tosense and coordinate the flow of behavior-regulating signals within the cellularcommunity. As the internal signal system evolved, its greater efficiency enabledthe brain to increase in size. Multicellular organisms gained increasingly morecells that were dedicated to responding to an ever-wider variety of externalenvironmental signals. While individual cells can respond to simple sensoryperceptions such as red, round, aromatic, and sweet, the extra brainpoweravailable in multicellular animals enables them to combine those simplesensations into a higher level of complexity and perceive “apple.”Fundamental reflex behaviors acquired through evolution are passed on tooffspring in the form of genetic-based instincts. The evolution of largerbrains, with their increased neural cell population, offered organisms theopportunity not only to rely on instinctual behavior, but also to learn fromtheir life experiences. The learning of novel reflex behaviors is essentially aproduct of conditioning. For example, consider the classic example of Pavlovtraining his dogs to salivate at the ring of a bell. He first trained them byringing a bell and coupling that stimulus with a food reward. After awhile, hewould ring the bell but not offer the food. By that time, the dogs were soprogrammed to expect the food that when the bell rang, they reflexively startedto salivate even though no food was present. This is clearly an “unconscious,”learned reflex behavior.Reflex behaviors may be as simple as the spontaneous kick of the leg when amallet taps the knee or as complex as driving a car at sixty-five miles per houron a crowded interstate highway while your conscious mind is fully engaged inconversation with a passenger. Though conditioned behavioral responses may beinordinately complex, they are “no-brainers.” Through the conditioned learningprocess, neural pathways between eliciting stimuli and behavioral responsesbecome hardwired to ensure a repetitive pattern. Hardwired pathways are“habits.” In lower animals, the entire brain is designed to engage in purelyhabitual responses to stimuli. Pavlov’s dogs salivate by reflex … not bydeliberate intention. The actions of the subconscious mind are reflexive innature and are not governed by reason or thinking. Physically, this mind isassociated with the activities of all of the brain structures that are presentin animals that have not evolved self-consciousness.Humans and a number of other higher mammals have evolved a specialized region ofthe brain associated with thinking, planning, and decision-making called theprefrontal cortex. This portion of the forebrain is apparently the seat of the“self-conscious” mind processing. The self-conscious mind is self-reflective; itis a newly evolved “sense organ” that observes our own behaviors and emotions.The self-conscious mind also has access to most of the data stored in ourlong-term memory bank. This is an extremely important feature allowing ourhistory of life to be considered as we consciously plan our futures.Endowed with the ability to be self-reflective, the self-conscious mind isextremely powerful. It can observe any programmed behavior we are engaged in,evaluate the behavior, and consciously decide to change the program. We canactively choose how to respond to most environmental signals and whether we evenwant to respond at all. The conscious mind’s capacity to override thesubconscious mind’s preprogrammed behaviors is the foundation of free will.However, our special gift comes with a special pitfall. While almost allorganisms have to actually experience the stimuli of life first-hand, the humanbrain’s ability to “learn” perceptions is so advanced that we can actuallyacquire perceptions indirectly from teachers. Once we accept the perceptions ofothers as “truths,” their perceptions become hardwired into our own brains,becoming our “truths.” Here’s where the problem arises: what if our teachers’perceptions are inaccurate? In such cases, our brains are then downloaded withmisperceptions. The subconscious mind is strictly a stimulus-response playbackdevice; there is no “ghost” in that part of the “machine” to ponder thelong-term consequences of the programs we engage. The subconscious works only inthe “now.” Consequently, programmed misperceptions in our subconscious mind arenot “monitored” and will habitually engage us in inappropriate and limitingbehaviors.If I included as a bonus in this chapter a slithering snake that pops out ofthis page right now, most of you would run from the room or throw the book outof the house. Whoever “introduced” you to your first snake may have behaved insuch a shocked way as to give your impressionable mind an apparently importantlife les-son: see snake … snake baaad! The subconscious memory system is verypartial to rapidly downloading and emphasizing perceptions regarding things inyour environment that are threatening to life and limb. If you were taught thatsnakes are dangerous, any time a snake comes into your proximity, youreflexively (unconsciously) engage in a protective response.But what if a herpetologist were reading this book and a snake popped out? Nodoubt herpetologists would not only be intrigued by the snake, they would bethrilled with the bonus included in the book. Or at least they’d be thrilledonce they figured out that the book’s snake was harmless. They would then holdit and watch its behaviors with delight. They would think that your programmedresponse was an irrational one because not all snakes are dangerous. Furtherthey would be saddened by the fact that so many people are deprived of thepleasure of studying such interesting creatures. Same snake, same stimulus, yetgreatly different responses.Our responses to environmental stimuli are indeed controlled by perceptions, butnot all of our learned perceptions are accurate. Not all snakes are dangerous!Yes, perception “controls” biology, but as we’ve seen, these perceptions can betrue or false. Therefore, we would be more accurate to refer to thesecontrolling perceptions as beliefs.Beliefs control biology!Ponder the significance of this information. We have the capacity to consciouslyevaluate our responses to environmental stimuli and change old responses anytime we desire … once we deal with the powerful subconscious mind, which Idiscuss in more depth in Chapter 7. We are not stuck with our genes or ourself-defeating behaviors!How the Mind Controls the BodyMy insights into how beliefs control biology are grounded in my studies ofcloned endothelial cells, the cells that line the blood vessels. The endothelialcells I grew in culture monitor their world closely and change their behaviorbased on information they pick up from the environment. When I providednutrients, the cells would gravitate toward those nutrients with the cellularequivalent of open arms. When I created a toxic environment, the cultured cellswould retreat from the stimulus in an effort to wall themselves off from thenoxious agents. My research focused on the membrane perception switches thatcontrolled the shift from one behavior to the other.The primary switch I was studying has a protein receptor that responds tohistamine, a molecule that the body uses in a way that is equivalent to a localemergency alarm. I found that there are two varieties of switches, H1 and H2,that respond to the same histamine signal. When activated, switches with H1histamine receptors evoke a protection response, the type of behavior revealedby cells in toxin-containing culture dishes. Switches containing H2 histaminereceptors evoke a growth response to histamine, similar to the behavior of cellscultured in the presence of nutrients.I subsequently learned that the body’s system-wide emergency response signal,adrenaline, also has switches sporting two different adrenaline-sensingreceptors, called alpha and beta. The adrenaline receptors provoked the exactsame cell behaviors as those elicited by histamine. When the adrenalalpha-receptor is part of an IMP switch, it provokes a protection response whenadrenaline is perceived. When the beta-receptor is part of the switch, the sameadrenaline signal activates a growth response. (Lipton, et al, 1992)All that was interesting, but the most exciting finding was when Isimultaneously introduced both histamine and adrenaline into my tissue cultures.I found that adrenaline signals, released by the central nervous system,override the influence of histamine signals that are produced locally. This iswhere the politics of the community described earlier come in to play. Supposeyou’re working in a bank. The branch manager gives you an order. The CEO walksin and gives you the opposite order. Which order would you follow? If you wantto keep your job you’ll snap to the CEO’s order. There is a similar prioritybuilt into our biology, which requires cells to follow instructions from thehead honcho nervous system, even if those signals are in conflict with localstimuli.I was excited by my experiments because I believed that they revealed on thesingle-cell level a truth for multicellular organisms—that the mind (acting viathe central nervous system’s adrenaline) overrides the body (acting via thelocal histamine signal). I wanted to spell out the implications of myexperiments in my research paper, but my colleagues almost died from apoplexy atthe notion of injecting the body-mind connection into a paper about cellbiology. So I put in a cryptic comment about understanding the significance ofthe study, but I couldn’t say what the significance was. My colleagues did notwant me to include these implications of my research because the mind is not anacceptable biological concept. Bioscientists are conventional Newtonians—if itisn’t matter, it doesn’t count. The “mind” is a non-localized energy andtherefore is not relevant to materialistic biology. Unfortunately, thatperception is a “belief” that has been proven to be patently incorrect in aquantum mechanical universe!Placebos: The Belief EffectEvery medical student learns, at least in passing, that the mind can affect thebody. They learn that some people get better when they believe (falsely) theyare getting medicine. When patients get better by ingesting a sugar pill,medicine defines it as the placebo effect. My friend Rob Williams, founder ofPSYCH-K, an energy-based psychological treatment system, suggests that it wouldbe more appropriate to refer to it as the perception effect. I call it thebelief effect to stress that our perceptions, whether they are accurate orinaccurate, equally impact our behavior and our bodies.I celebrate the belief effect, which is an amazing testament to the healingability of the body/mind. However, the “all in their minds” placebo effect hasbeen linked by traditional medicine to, at worst, quacks or, at best, weak,suggestible patients. The placebo effect is quickly glossed over in medicalschools so that students can get to the real tools of modern medicine like drugsand surgery.This is a giant mistake. The placebo effect should be a major topic of study inmedical school. I believe that medical education should train doctors torecognize the power of our internal resources. Doctors should not dismiss thepower of the mind as something inferior to the power of chemicals and thescalpel. They should let go of their conviction that the body and its parts areessentially stupid and that we need outside intervention to maintain our health.The placebo effect should be the subject of major, funded research efforts. Ifmedical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect, theywould hand doctors an efficient, energy-based, side effect–free tool to treatdisease. Energy healers say they already have such tools, but I am a scientist,and I believe the more we know about the science of the placebo, the betterwe’ll be able to use it in clinical settings.I believe the reason the mind has so summarily been dismissed in medicine is theresult, not only of dogmatic thinking, but also of financial considerations. Ifthe power of your mind can heal your sick body, why should you go to the doctorand more importantly, why would you need to buy drugs? In fact, I was recentlychagrined to learn that drug companies are studying patients who respond tosugar pills with the goal of eliminating them from early clinical trials. Itinevitably disturbs pharmaceutical manufacturers that in most of their clinicaltrials the placebos, the “fake” drugs, prove to be as effective as theirengineered chemical cocktails. (Greenberg 2003) Though the drug companies insistthey’re not trying to make it easier for ineffective drugs to get approved, itis clear that effectiveness of placebo pills is a threat to the pharmaceuticalindustry. The message from the drug companies is clear to me: if you can’t beatplacebo pills fairly, simply remove the competition!The fact that most doctors are not trained to consider the impact of the placeboeffect is ironic because some historians make a strong case that the history ofmedicine is largely the history of the placebo effect. For most of medicalhistory, doctors did not have effective methods to fight disease. Some of themore notorious treatments once prescribed by mainstream medicine includebloodletting, treating wounds with arsenic, and the proverbial cure-all,rattlesnake oil. No doubt some patients, the conservatively estimated one thirdof the population who are particularly susceptible to the healing power of theplacebo effect, got better with those treatments. In today’s world, when doctorswearing white coats deliver a treatment decisively, patients may believe thetreatment works—and so it does, whether it is a real drug or just a sugar pill.Though the question of how placebos work has in the main been ignored bymedicine, recently some mainstream medical researchers are turning theirattention to it. The results of those studies suggest that it is not only wacky,nineteenth-century treatments that can foster a placebo effect but also modernmedicine’s sophisticated technology, including the most “concrete” of medicaltools, surgery.A Baylor School of Medicine study, published in 2002 in the New England Journalof Medicine evaluated surgery for patients with severe, debilitating knee pain.(Moseley, et al, 2002) The lead author of the study, Dr. Bruce Moseley, “knew”that knee surgery helped his patients: “All good surgeons know there is noplacebo effect in surgery.” But Moseley was trying to figure out which part ofthe surgery was giving his patients relief. The patients in the study weredivided into three groups. Moseley shaved the damaged cartilage in the knee ofone group. For another group, he flushed out the knee joint, removing materialthought to be causing the inflammatory effect. Both of these constitute standardtreatment for arthritic knees. The third group got “fake” surgery. The patientwas sedated, Moseley made three standard incisions and then talked and actedjust as he would have during a real surgery—he even splashed salt water tosimulate the sound of the knee-washing procedure. After 40 minutes, Moseleysewed up the incisions as if he had done the surgery. All three groups wereprescribed the same postoperative care, which included an exercise program.The results were shocking. Yes, the groups who received surgery, as expected,improved. But the placebo group improved just as much as the other two groups!Despite the fact that there are 650,000 surgeries yearly for arthritic knees, ata cost of about $5,000 each, the results were clear to Moseley: “My skill as asurgeon had no benefit on these patients. The entire benefit of surgery forosteoarthritis of the knee was the placebo effect.” Television news programsgraphically illustrated the stunning results. Footage showed members of theplacebo group walking and playing basketball, in short doing things theyreported they could not do before their “surgery.” The placebo patients didn’tfind out for two years that they had gotten fake surgery. One member of theplacebo group, Tim Perez, who had to walk with a cane before the surgery, is nowable to play basketball with his grandchildren. He summed up the theme of thisbook when he told the Discovery Health Channel: “In this world anything ispossible when you put your mind to it. I know that your mind can work miracles.”Studies have shown the placebo effect to be powerful in treating other diseases,including asthma and Parkinson’s. In the treatment of depression, placebos arestars. So much so that psychiatrist Walter Brown of the Brown University Schoolof Medicine has proposed placebo pills as the first treatment for patients withmild or moderate depression. (Brown 1998) Patients would be told that they’regetting a remedy with no active ingredient, but that shouldn’t dampen the pills’effectiveness. Studies suggest that even when people know they’re not getting adrug, the placebo pills still work.One indication of the power of the placebo came from a report from the UnitedStates Department of Health and Human Services. The report found that half ofseverely depressed patients taking drugs improve versus thirty-two percenttaking a placebo. (Horgan 1999) Even that impressive showing may underestimatethe power of the placebo effect because many study participants figure outthey’re taking the real drug because they experience side effects that are notexperienced by those taking the placebo. Once those patients realize they’retaking the drug, i.e., once they start believing that they’re getting the realpill, they are particularly more susceptible to the placebo effect.Given the power of the placebo, it is no wonder that the $8.2 billionantidepressant industry is under attack by critics who charge that drugcompanies are hyping the effectiveness of their pills. In a 2002 article in theAmerican Psychological Association’s Prevention & Treatment, “The Emperor’s NewDrugs,” University of Connecticut psychology professor Irving Kirsch found thateighty percent of the effect of antidepressants, as measured in clinical trials,could be attributed to the placebo effect. (Kirsch, et al, 2002) Kirsch had toinvoke the Freedom of Information Act in 2001 to get information on the clinicaltrials of the top antidepressants: these data were not forthcoming from the Foodand Drug Administration. The data show that in more than half of the clinicaltrials for the six leading antidepressants, the drugs did not outperformplacebo, sugar pills. And Kirsch noted in a Discovery Health Channel interviewthat “the difference between the response of the drugs and the response ofplacebo was less than two points on average on this clinical scale that goesfrom fifty to sixty points. That’s a very small difference. That differenceclinically is meaningless.”Another interesting fact about the effectiveness of antidepressants is that theyhave performed better and better in clinical trials over the years, suggestingthat their placebo effects are in part due to savvy marketing. The more themiracle of antidepressants was touted in the media and in advertisements, themore effective they became. Beliefs are contagious! We now live in a culturewhere people believe that antidepressants work, and so they do.A California interior designer, Janis Schonfeld, who took part in a clinicaltrial to test the efficacy of Effexor in 1997, was just as “stunned” as Perezwhen she found out that she had been on a placebo. Not only had the pillsrelieved her of the depression that had plagued her for thirty years, the brainscans she received throughout the study found that the activity of herprefrontal cortex was greatly enhanced. (Leuchter, et al, 2002) Her improvementswere not “all in her head.” When the mind changes, it absolutely affects yourbiology. Schonfeld also experienced nausea, a common Effexor side effect. She istypical of patients who improve with placebo treatment and then find out theywere not on the real drug—she was convinced the doctors had made a mistake inthe labeling for she “knew” she was on the drug. She insisted that theresearchers double-check their records to make absolutely sure she wasn’t on thedrug.Nocebos: The Power of Negative BeliefsWhile many in the medical profession are aware of the placebo effect, few haveconsidered its implications for self-healing. If positive thinking can pull youout of depression and heal a damaged knee, consider what negative thinking cando in your life. When the mind, through positive suggestion improves health, itis referred to as the placebo effect. Conversely, when the same mind is engagedin negative suggestions that can damage health the negative effects are referredto as the nocebo effect.In medicine, the nocebo effect can be as powerful as the placebo effect, a factyou should keep in mind every time you step into a doctor’s office. By theirwords and their demeanor, physicians can convey hope-deflating messages to theirpatients, messages that are, I believe, completely unwarranted. Albert Mason,for example, thinks his inability to project optimism to his patients hamperedhis efforts with his ichthyosis patients. Another example is the potential powerof the statement: “You have six months to live.” If you choose to believe yourdoctor’s message, you are not likely to have much more time on this Earth.I have cited the Discovery Health Channel’s 2003 program “Placebo: Mind OverMedicine” in this chapter because it is a good compendium of some of medicine’smost interesting cases. One of its more poignant segments featured a Nashvillephysician, Clifton Meador, who has been reflecting on the potential power of thenocebo effect for 30 years. In 1974 Meador had a patient, Sam Londe, a retiredshoe salesman suffering from cancer of the esophagus, a condition that was atthe time considered 100 percent fatal. Londe was treated for that cancer, buteveryone in the medical community “knew” that his esophageal cancer would recur.So it was no surprise when Londe died a few weeks after his diagnosis.The surprise came after Londe’s death when an autopsy found very little cancerin his body, certainly not enough to kill him. There were a couple of spots inthe liver and one in the lung, but there was no trace of the esophageal cancerthat everyone thought had killed him. Meador told the Discovery Health Channel:“He died with cancer, but not from cancer.” What did Londe die of if notesophageal cancer? Had he died because he believed he was going to die? The casestill haunts Meador three decades after Londe’s death: “I thought he had cancer.He thought he had cancer. Everybody around him thought he had cancer … did Iremove hope in some way?” Troublesome nocebo cases suggest that physicians,parents, and teachers can remove hope by programming you to believe you arepowerless.Our positive and negative beliefs not only impact our health but also everyaspect of our life. Henry Ford was right about the efficiency of assembly lines,and he was right about the power of the mind: “If you believe you can or if youbelieve you can’t … you’re right.” Think about the implications of the man whoblithely drank the bacteria that medicine had decided caused cholera. Considerthe people who walk across coals without getting burned. If they wobble in thesteadfastness of their belief that they can do it, they wind up with burnedfeet. Your beliefs act like filters on a camera, changing how you see the world.And your biology adapts to those beliefs. When we truly recognize that ourbeliefs are that powerful, we hold the key to freedom. While we cannot readilychange the codes of our genetic blueprints, we can change our minds.In my lectures I provide two sets of plastic filters, one red and one green. Ihave the audience pick one color and then look at a blank screen. I then tellthem to yell out whether the image I project next is one that generates love orgenerates fear. Those in the audience that don the red “belief” filters see aninviting picture of a cottage labeled “House of Love,” flowers, a sunny sky andthe message: “I live in Love.” Those wearing the green filters see a threateningdark sky, bats, snakes, a ghost hovering outside a dark, gloomy house and thewords: “I live in fear.” I always get enjoyment out of seeing how the audienceresponds to the confusion when half yell out: “I live in love,” and the otherhalf, in equal certainty, yells out: “I live in fear” in response to the sameimage.Then I ask the audience to change to the opposite colored filters. My point isthat you can choose what to see. You can filter your life with rose-coloredbeliefs that will help your body grow or you can use a dark filter that turnseverything black and makes your body/mind more susceptible to disease. You canlive a life of fear or live a life of love. You have the choice! But I can tellyou that if you choose to see a world full of love, your body will respond bygrowing in health. If you choose to believe that you live in a dark world fullof fear, your body’s health will be compromised as you physiologically closeyourself down in a protection response.Learning how to harness your mind to promote growth is the secret of life, whichis why I called this book The Biology of Belief. Of course the secret of life isnot a secret at all. Teachers like Buddha and Jesus have been telling us thesame story for millennia. Now science is pointing in the same direction. It isnot our genes but our beliefs that control our lives … Oh ye of little belief!That thought is a good entrée into the next chapter, in which I’ll detail howliving in love and living in fear create opposite effects in the body and themind. Before we leave this chapter, I’d just like to emphasize again that notonly is there nothing wrong with going through life wearing the proverbialrose-colored glasses. In fact, those rose-colored glasses are necessary for yourcells to thrive. Positive thoughts are a biological mandate for a happy, healthylife. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi:Your beliefs become your thoughtsYour thoughts become your wordsYour words become your actionsYour actions become your habitsYour habits become your valuesYour values become your destiny"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d41155131]-1743745872 [images/9781401923112_0144_002.jpg]GROWTH AND PROTECTIONEvolution has provided us with lots of survival mechanisms. They can be roughlydivided into two functional categories: growth and protection. These growth andprotection mechanisms are the fundamental behaviors required for an organism tosurvive. I’m sure you know how important it is to protect yourself. You may notrealize though that growth is vitally important for your survival as well—evenif you’re an adult who has reached your full height. Every day billions of cellsin your body wear out and need to be replaced. For example, the entire cellularlining of your gut is replaced every seventy-two hours. In order to maintainthis continuous turnover of cells, your body needs to expend a significantamount of energy daily.By now you won’t be surprised to learn that I first became aware of howimportant growth and protection behaviors are in the laboratory where myobservations of single cells have so often led me to insights about themulticellular human body. When I was cloning human endothelial cells, theyretreated from toxins that I introduced into the culture dish, just as humansretreat from mountain lions and muggers in dark alleys. They also gravitated tonutrients, just as humans gravitate to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and love. Theseopposing movements define the two basic cellular responses to environmentalstimuli. Gravitating to a life-sustaining signal, such as nutrients,characterizes a growth response; moving away from threatening signals, such astoxins, characterizes a protection response. It must also be noted that someenvironmental stimuli are neutral; they provoke neither a growth nor aprotection response.My research at Stanford showed that these growth/protection behaviors are alsoessential for the survival of multicellular organisms such as humans. But thereis a catch to these opposing survival mechanisms that have evolved over billionsof years. It turns out that the mechanisms that support growth and protectioncannot operate optimally at the same time. In other words, cells cannotsimultaneously move forward and backward. The human blood vessel cells I studiedat Stanford exhibited one microscopic anatomy for providing nutrition and acompletely different microscopic anatomy for providing a protection response.What they couldn’t do was exhibit both configurations at the same time. (Lipton,et al, 1991)In a response similar to that displayed by cells, humans unavoidably restricttheir growth behaviors when they shift into a protective mode. If you’re runningfrom a mountain lion, it’s not a good idea to expend energy on growth. In orderto survive—that is, escape the lion—you summon all your energy for your fight orflight response. Redistributing energy reserves to fuel the protection responseinevitably results in a curtailment of growth.In addition to diverting energy to support the tissues and organs needed for theprotection response, there is an additional reason why growth is inhibited.Growth processes require an open exchange between an organism and itsenvironment. For example, food is taken in and waste products are excreted.However, protection requires a closing down of the system to wall the organismoff from the perceived threat.Inhibiting growth processes is also debilitating in that growth is a processthat not only expends energy but is also required to produce energy.Consequently, a sustained protection response inhibits the creation oflife-sustaining energy. The longer you stay in protection, the more youcompromise your growth. In fact, you can shut down growth processes socompletely that it becomes a truism that you can be “scared to death.”Thankfully, most of us don’t get to the “scared to death” point. Unlike singlecells, the growth/protection response in multicellular organisms is not aneither/or proposition—not all of our 50 trillion cells have to be in growth orprotection mode at the same time. The proportion of cells in a protectionresponse depends on the severity of the perceived threats. You can survive whileunder stress from these threats but chronic inhibition of growth mechanismsseverely compromises your vitality. It is also important to note that to fullyexperience your vitality it takes more than just getting rid of life’sstressors. In a growth-protection continuum, eliminating the stressors only putsyou at the neutral point in the range. To fully thrive, we must not onlyeliminate the stressors but also actively seek joyful, loving, fulfilling livesthat stimulate growth processes.The Biology of Homeland DefenseIn multicellular organisms, growth/protection behaviors are controlled by thenervous system. It is the nervous system’s job to monitor environmental signals,interpret them, and organize appropriate behavioral responses. In amulticellular community, the nervous system acts like the government inorganizing the activities of its cellular citizens. When the nervous systemrecognizes a threatening environmental stress, it alerts the community of cellsto impending danger.The body is actually endowed with two separate protection systems, each vital tothe maintenance of life. The first is the system that mobilizes protectionagainst external threats. It is called the HPA axis, which stands for theHypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis. When there are no threats, the HPA axis isinactive and growth flourishes. However, when the brain’s hypothalamus perceivesan environmental threat, it engages the HPA axis by sending a signal to thepituitary gland, the “Master Gland,” which is responsible for organizing thefifty trillion cells of the community to deal with the impending threat.Think back to the cell membrane’s stimulus-response mechanism, thereceptor-effector proteins—the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are behavioralequivalents. Similar to the role of a receptor protein, the hypothalamusreceives and recognizes environmental signals; the pituitary’s functionresembles that of the effector protein in that it launches the body’s organsinto action. In response to threats from the external environment, the pituitarygland sends a signal to the adrenal glands, informing them of the need tocoordinate the body’s “fight or flight” response.The technical details of how stress stimuli engage the HPA axis follow a simplecascade: In response to perceptions of stress registered in the brain, thehypothalamus secretes a corticotropinreleasing factor (CRF), which travels tothe pituitary gland. CRF activates special pituitary hormone-secreting cellscausing them to release adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACTH) into the blood. TheACTH then makes its way to the adrenal glands, where it serves as the signal toturn on the secretion of the “fight-flight” adrenal hormones. These stresshormones coordinate the function of the body’s organs, providing us with greatphysiologic power to fend off or flee from danger.Once the adrenal alarm is sounded, the stress hormones released into the bloodconstrict the blood vessels of the digestive tract, forcing the energy-providingblood to preferentially nourish the tissues of the arms and legs that enable usto get out of harm’s way. Before the blood was sent to the extremities, it wasconcentrated in the visceral organs. Redistributing the viscera’s blood to thelimbs in the fight or flight response results in an inhibition of growth-relatedfunctions; without the blood’s nourishment the visceral organs cannot functionproperly. The visceral organs stop doing their life-sustaining work ofdigestion, absorption, excretion, and other functions that provide for thegrowth of the cells and the production of the body’s energy reserves. Hence, thestress response inhibits growth processes and further compromises the body’ssurvival by interfering with the generation of vital energy reserves.-1743745704 [images/9781401923112_0148_001.jpg]The body’s second protection system is the immune system, which protects us fromthreats originating under the skin, such as those caused by bacteria andviruses. When the immune system is mobilized, it can consume much of the body’senergy supply. To get a sense of how much energy the immune system expends,recall how physically weak you become when you are fighting infections such as aflu or a cold. When the HPA axis mobilizes the body for fight or flightresponse, the adrenal hormones directly repress the action of the immune systemto conserve energy reserves. In fact, stress hormones are so effective atcurtailing immune system function that doctors provided them to recipients oftransplants so that their immune systems wouldn’t reject the foreign tissues.Why would the adrenal system shut down the immune system? Imagine that you arein your tent on the African savannah suffering from a bacterial infection andexperiencing a bad case of diarrhea. You hear the gutty growl of a lion outsideyour tent. The brain must make a decision about which is the greater threat. Itwill do your body no good to conquer the bacteria if you let a lion maul you. Soyour body halts the fight against the infection in favor of mobilizing energyfor flight to survive your close encounter with a lion. Therefore, a secondaryconsequence of engaging the HPA axis is that it interferes with our ability tofight disease.Activating the HPA axis also interferes with our ability to think clearly. Theprocessing of information in the forebrain, the center of executive reasoningand logic, is significantly slower than the reflex activity controlled by thehindbrain. In an emergency, the faster the information processing, the morelikely the organism will survive. Adrenal stress hormones constrict the bloodvessels in the forebrain reducing its ability to function. Additionally, thehormones repress activity in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, the center ofconscious volitional action. In an emergency, the vascular flow and hormonesserve to activate the hindbrain, the source of life-sustaining reflexes thatmost effectively control fight or flight behavior. While it is necessary thatstress signals repress the slower processing conscious mind to enhance survival,it comes at a cost … diminished conscious awareness and reduced intelligence.(Takamatsu, et al, 2003; Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic 1998; Goldstein, et al, 1996)Fear KillsRemember the shell shocked, frozen look on my Caribbean medical students’ faceswhen they failed my test, the medical school equivalent of a voracious lion? Hadmy students stayed frozen in fear, I can guarantee you that they would haveperformed dismally on their finals. The simple truth is, when you’re frightened,you’re dumber. Teachers see it all the time among students who “don’t testwell.” Exam stress paralyzes these students who, with trembling hands, markwrong answers because in their panic, they can’t access cerebrally storedinformation they have carefully acquired all semester.The HPA system is a brilliant mechanism for handling acute stresses. However,this protection system was not designed to be continuously activated. In today’sworld, most of the stresses we are experiencing are not in the form of acute,concrete “threats” that we can easily identify, respond to, and move on. We areconstantly besieged by multitudes of unresolvable worries about our personallives, our jobs, and our war-torn global community. Such worries do not threatenour immediate survival, but they nevertheless can activate the HPA axis,resulting in chronically elevated stress hormones.To illustrate the adverse effects of sustained adrenaline, let’s use an exampleof a track race. An extremely well-trained and healthy group of sprinters stepup to the starting line. When they hear the command: “On your mark!” they get ontheir hands and knees and adjust their feet into the starting blocks. Then thestarter barks out, “Get set.” The athletes’ muscles tighten as they propthemselves up on their fingers and toes. When they shift into “Get set” mode,their bodies release the flight-promoting adrenaline hormones that power theirmuscles for the arduous task ahead. While the athletes are on hold awaiting the“Go” command, their bodies are straining in anticipation of that task. In anormal race, that strain lasts only a second or two before the starter yells,“Go!” However, in our mythical race, the “Go” command, which would launch theathletes into action, never comes. The athletes are left in the starting blocks,their blood coursing with adrenaline, their bodies fatiguing with the strain ofpreparing for the race that never comes. No matter how toned their physique,within seconds, these athletes will physically collapse from the strain.We live in a “Get set” world and an increasing body of research suggests thatour hyper-vigilant lifestyle is severely impacting the health of our bodies. Ourdaily stressors are constantly activating the HPA axis, priming our bodies foraction. Unlike competitive athletes, the stresses in our bodies are not releasedfrom the pressures generated by our chronic fears and concerns. Almost everymajor illness that people acquire has been linked to chronic stress. (Segerstromand Miller 2004; Kopp and Réthelyi 2004; McEwen and Lasky 2002; McEwen andSeeman 1999)In a revealing study published in 2003 in Science, researchers considered whypatients on SSRI antidepressants, such as Prozac or Zoloft, don’t feel betterright away. There is usually at least a two-week lag between starting the drugsand the time the patients feel they are getting better. The study found thatdepressed people exhibit a surprising lack of cell division in the region of thebrain called the hippocampus, a part of the nervous system involved with memory.Hippocampal cells renewed cell division at the time patients first began toexperience the mood-shifting effect of the SSRI drugs, weeks after the onset ofthe drug regimen. This study and others challenge the theory that depression issimply the result of a “chemical imbalance” affecting the brain’s production ofmonoamine signaling chemicals, specifically serotonin. If it were as simple asthat, the SSRI drugs would likely restore that chemical balance right away.More researchers are pointing to the inhibition of neuronal growth by stresshormones as the source of depression. In fact, in chronically depressedpatients, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, the center of higherreasoning, are physically shrunken. A review of this study published in Sciencereported: “Overtaking the monoamine hypothesis in recent years has been thestress hypothesis, which posits that depression is caused when the brain’sstress machinery goes into overdrive. The most prominent player in this theoryis the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.” (Holden 2003)The HPA axis’ effect on the cellular community mirrors the effect of stress on ahuman population. Picture a vibrant community back in the Cold War years, whenthe possibility of a nuclear attack by the Russians weighed heavily onAmericans’ minds. Like cells in a multicellular organism, the members of thisCold War society actively work at jobs that contribute to the community’s growthand usually get along with each other. Factories are busy manufacturing,construction people are building new homes, grocery stores are selling food, andkids are in school learning their ABCs. The community is in a state of healthand growth while its residents constructively interact toward a common goal.Suddenly, the sound of an air raid siren rocks the town. Everyone stops workingto run off, seeking the safety of bomb shelters. The harmony of the community isdisrupted as individuals, acting only in support of their own survival, fighttheir way to a bomb shelter. After five minutes, the all-clear signal sounds.Residents return to their jobs and resume their lives in a growing community.But what would happen if the sirens sound, the residents run into their air raidshelters, and there is no all-clear signal to release them? People would stay intheir protective postures indefinitely. How long can they maintain theirprotection posture? The community eventually collapses in the face of dwindlingfood and water supplies. One by one even the strongest die because chronicstress is debilitating. A community can easily survive short-term stress, likean air raid drill, but when the stress goes on and on it results in cessation ofgrowth and the breakdown of the community.Another illustration of the influence of stress on a population is the story ofthe 9/11 tragedy. Up to the moment the terrorists attacked, the country was in astate of growth. Then immediately after 9/11, as the shock of the news spread toreach not just the people of New York but the entire nation, we experienced athreat to our survival. The impact of government proclamations stressing thecontinued presence of danger in the wake of the attack was like the influence ofthe adrenal signals. They shifted the members of the community from a state ofgrowth to a state of protection. After a few days of this heart-stopping fear,the country’s economic vitality was so compromised that the president had tointervene. To stimulate growth, the president repeatedly emphasized, “America isopen for business.” It took awhile for the fears to subside and for the economyto rebound. However, the residual threats of terrorism are still debilitatingthe vitality of our country. As a nation we should look more carefully at howour fear of future acts of terrorism is undermining our quality of life. In somesense, the terrorists have already won since they have succeeded in frighteningus into a chronic, soul-sapping protective mode.I’d also like to suggest that you examine how your fears and the ensuingprotection behaviors impact your life. What fears are stunting your growth?Where did these fears come from? Are they necessary? Are they real? Are theycontributing to a full life? We’ll deal more with these fears and where we gotthem in the next chapter on conscious parenting. If we can control our fears, wecan regain control over our lives. President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew thedestructive nature of fear. He chose his words carefully when he told the nationin the grips of the Great Depression and looming World War: “We have nothing tofear, but fear itself.” Letting go of our fears is the first step towardcreating a fuller, more satisfying life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3281]-1743745492 [images/9781401923112_0154_002.jpg]CONSCIOUS PARENTING:Parents as Genetic EngineersNo doubt you’ve heard the seductive argument that once parents bestow theirgenes on their children, they take a back seat in their children’s lives—parentsneed only refrain from abusing their children, feed and clothe them, and thenwait to see where their preprogrammed genes lead them. This notion allowsparents to continue with their “pre-kids lives”—they can simply drop theirchildren off at daycare and with babysitters. It’s an appealing idea for busyand/or lazy parents.It’s also appealing for parents like me, who have biological children withradically different personalities. I used to think that my daughters aredifferent because they inherited different sets of genes from the moment ofconception—a random selection process in which their mother and I had no part.After all, I thought, they grew up in the same environment (nurture), so thereason for their differences had to be genetic (nature).The reality, I know now, is very different. Frontier science is confirming whatmothers and enlightened fathers have known forever, that parents do matter,despite best-selling books that try to convince them otherwise. To quote Dr.Thomas Verny, a pioneer in the field of prenatal and perinatal psychiatry:“Findings in the peer-reviewed literature over the course of decades establish,beyond any doubt, that parents have overwhelming influence on the mental andphysical attributes of the children they raise.” (Verny and Kelly 1981)And that influence starts, says Verny, not after children are born, but BEFOREchildren are born. When Verny first posited the notion that the influence ofparents extends even to the womb in his landmark, 1981 book, The Secret Life ofthe Unborn Child, the scientific evidence was preliminary and the “experts”skeptical. Because scientists used to think that the human brain did not becomefunctional until after birth, it was assumed that fetuses and infants had nomemory and felt no pain. After all, noted Freud, who coined the termed“infantile amnesia,” most people do not remember anything that happened to thembefore they were three or four years old.However, experimental psychologists and neuroscientists are demolishing the myththat infants cannot remember—or for that matter learn—and along with it thenotion that parents are simply spectators in the unfolding of their children’slives. The fetal and infant nervous system has vast sensory and learningcapabilities and a kind of memory that neuroscientists call implicit memory.Another pioneer in pre- and perinatal psychology, David Chamberlain writes inhis book The Mind of Your Newborn Baby: “The truth is, much of what we havetraditionally believed about babies is false. They are not simple beings butcomplex and ageless—small creatures with unexpectedly large thoughts.”(Chamberlain 1998)These complex, small creatures have a pre-birth life in the womb that profoundlyinfluences their long-term health and behavior. “The quality of life in thewomb, our temporary home before we were born, programs our susceptibility tocoronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and a multitude of otherconditions in later life,” writes Dr. Peter W. Nathanielsz in Life in the Womb:The Origin of Health and Disease. (Nathanielsz 1999) Recently, an even widerrange of adult-related chronic disorders, including osteoporosis, mooddisorders, and psychoses, have been intimately linked to pre- and perinataldevelopmental influences. (Gluckman and Hanson 2004)Recognizing the role the prenatal environment plays in creating disease forces areconsideration of genetic determinism. Nathanielsz writes: “There is mountingevidence that programming of lifetime health by the conditions in the womb isequally, if not more important, than our genes in determining how we performmentally and physically during life. Gene myopia is the term that best describesthe current all-pervasive view that our health and destiny throughout life arecontrolled by our genes alone. In contrast to the relative fatalism of genemyopia, understanding the mechanisms that underlie programming by the quality oflife in the womb, we can improve the start in life for our children and theirchildren.”The programming “mechanisms” Nathanielsz refers to are the epigeneticmechanisms, discussed earlier, by which environmental stimuli regulate geneactivity. As Nathanielsz states, parents can improve the prenatal environment.In so doing they act as genetic engineers for their children. The idea thatparents can transmit hereditary changes from their life to their children is, ofcourse, a Lamarckian concept that conflicts with Darwinism. Nathanielsz is oneof the scientists now brave enough to invoke the “L” word for Lamarck: “thetransgenerational passage of characteristics by nongenetic means does occur.Lamarck was right, although trans-generational transmission of acquiredcharacteristics occurs by mechanisms that were unknown in his day.”The responsiveness of individuals to the environmental conditions perceived bytheir mothers before birth allows them to optimize their genetic and physiologicdevelopment as they adapt to the environmental forecast. The same life-enhancingepigenetic plasticity of human development can go awry and lead to an array ofchronic diseases in older age if an individual experiences adverse nutritionaland environmental circumstances during fetal and neonatal periods ofdevelopment. (Bateson, et al, 2004)The same epigenetic influences also continue after the child is born becauseparents continue to influence their child’s environment. In particular,fascinating new research is emphasizing the importance of good parenting in thedevelopment of the brain. “For the growing brain of a young child, the socialworld supplies the most important experiences influencing the expression ofgenes, which determines how neurons connect to one another in creating theneuronal pathways which give rise to mental activity,” writes Dr. Daniel J.Siegel in The Developing Mind. (Siegel 1999) In other words, infants need anurturing environment to activate the genes that develop healthy brains.Parents, the latest science reveals, continue to act as genetic engineers evenafter the birth of their child.Parental Programming: The Power of the Subconscious MindI’d like to tell you about how I—who put myself in the category of those whowere not prepared to have children—came to question my ingrained assumptionsabout parenting. You won’t be surprised to hear that I started my reevaluationin the Caribbean, the place where my shift to the New Biology took root. Myreassessment was actually inspired by an unlucky event, a motorcycle accident. Iwas on my way to present a lecture when I went off a curb at high speed. Thebike wound up upside down. Luckily I was wearing a helmet because I sustained amajor blow to my head when the bike hit the ground. I was unconscious for halfan hour and for a while my students and colleagues thought I was dead. When Icame to, I felt as if I had broken every bone in my body.For the next few days I could hardly walk, and when doing so, I resembled ayelping version of Quasimodo. Every step was a painful reminder that “speedkills.” As I creaked out of the classroom one afternoon, one of my studentssuggested that it might help if I visited his roommate, a fellow student, whowas also a chiropractor. As I explained in the last chapter, I not only hadnever been to a chiropractor, I had been taught by my allopathic community toshun chiropractors as quacks. But when you’re in that much pain and you’re in anunfamiliar setting, you wind up trying things you would never consider in yourcushier moments.At the chiropractor’s make shift dormitory “office” I was introduced for thefirst time to kinesiology, popularly known as muscle testing. The chiropractortold me to hold out my arm and resist the downward pressure he applied to it. Ihad no problem resisting the light force he put on my arm. Then he asked me tohold out my arm and resist him again while I said, “My name is Bruce.” Again, Ihad no trouble resisting him, but by now I was starting to think that theadmonishments of my academic colleagues were right on the mark—“This is nuts!”Then, the chiropractor told me to hold out my arm and resist his pressure whilesaying earnestly, “My name is Mary.” To my amazement, my arm flopped down,despite my strong resistance. “Now wait a minute,” I said. “I must not have beenresisting enough, try that again.” So we did, and this time I concentrated evenmore forcefully on resisting. Nevertheless, after repeating, “My name is Mary,”my arm sunk like a stone. This student, who was now my teacher, explained thatwhen your conscious mind has a belief that is in conflict with a formerlylearned “truth” stored in the subconscious mind, the intellectual conflictexpresses itself as a weakening of the body’s muscles.To my astonishment, I realized that my conscious mind, which I exercised soconfidently in academic settings, was not in control when I voiced an opinionthat differed from a truth stored in the unconscious mind. My unconscious mindwas undoing the best efforts of my conscious mind to hold up my arm when Iclaimed my name was Mary. I was amazed to discover that there was another“mind,” another force that was co-piloting my life. More shocking was the factthat this hidden mind, the mind I knew little about (except theoretically inpsychology) was actually more powerful than my conscious mind, just as Freud hadclaimed. All in all, my first visit to a chiropractor turned out to be alife-changing experience. I learned that chiropractors could tap into the body’sinnate healing power using kinesiology to target spinal misalignments. I wasable to saunter out of that dorm feeling like a new man after a few simple,vertebral adjustments on the “quack’s” table … all without the use of drugs. Andmost importantly, I was introduced to the “man behind the curtain,” mysubconscious mind!As I left the campus, my conscious mind was awhirl over the implications of thesuperior power of my formerly hidden subconscious mind. I also coupled thosemusings with my study of quantum physics, which taught me that thoughts couldpropel behavior more efficiently than physical molecules. My subconscious “knew”that my name was not Mary and balked at my insistence that it was. What else didmy subconscious mind “know,” and how had it learned it?To understand better what had happened in that chiropractor’s office, I firstturned to comparative neuroanatomy which reveals that the lower an organism ison the Tree of Evolution, the less developed its nervous system and thus themore it relies on preprogrammed behavior (nature). Moths fly toward the light,sea turtles return to specific islands and lay their eggs on the beach at theappropriate time, and the swallows return to Capistrano on a specific date, yet,as far as we know, none of these organisms have any knowledge of why they engagein those behaviors. The behaviors are innate; they are genetically built intothe organism and are classified as instincts.Organisms higher in the Tree have more complexly integrated nervous systemsheaded by bigger and bigger brains that allow them to acquire intricatebehavioral patterns through experiential learning (nurture). The complexity ofthis environmental learning mechanism presumably culminates with humans, who areat the top, or at least near the top, of the Tree. To quote anthropologistsEmily A. Schultz and Robert H. Lavenda: “Human beings are more dependent onlearning for survival than other species. We have no instincts thatautomatically protect us and find us food and shelter, for example.” (Schultzand Lavenda 1987)We do have, of course, behavioral instincts that are innate—consider theinfant’s instinct to suckle, to quickly move his hand away from fire, and toautomatically swim when placed in water. Instincts are built-in behaviors thatare fundamental to the survival of all humans, independent of what culture theybelong to or what time in human history they were born. We are born with theability to swim; infants can swim like graceful porpoises moments after they areborn. But children quickly acquire a fear of water from their parents—observethe response of parents when their unattended child ventures near a pool orother open water. Children learn from their parents that water is dangerous.Parents must later struggle to teach Johnny how to swim. Their first big effortis focused on overcoming the fear of water they instilled in earlier years.But through evolution, our learned perceptions have become more powerful,especially because they can override genetically programmed instincts. Thebody’s physiological mechanisms (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, bloodflow/bleeding patterns, body temperature) are, by their nature, programmedinstincts. However, yogis as well as everyday people using biofeedback can learnto consciously regulate these “innate” functions.Scientists have focused on our big brains as the reason for our ability to learnsuch complex behavior. However, we should temper our enthusiasm for the bigbrain theory by considering that cetaceans (porpoises and dolphins) have agreater cerebral surface area packed into their craniums than we do.And the findings of British neurologist Dr. John Lorber, highlighted in a 1980article in Science “Is your Brain Really Necessary?” also call into question thenotion that the size of the brain is the most important consideration for humanintelligence. (Lewin 1980) Lorber studied many cases of hydrocephalus (“water onthe brain”) and concluded that even when most of the brain’s cerebral cortex,the brain’s outer layer, is missing, patients can live normal lives. Sciencewriter Roger Lewin quotes Lorber in his article:There’s a young student at this university (Sheffield Uni-versity) who has an IQof 126, has gained a first-class honors degree in mathematics, and is sociallycompletely normal. And yet the boy has virtually no brain … When we did a brainscan on him, we saw that instead of the normal 4.5 centimeter thickness of braintissue between the ventricles and the cortical surface, there was just a thinlayer of mantle measuring a millimeter or so. His cranium is filled mainly withcerebrospinal fluid.Lorber’s provocative findings suggest that we need to reconsider our long-heldbeliefs about how the brain works and the physical foundation of humanintelligence. I submit in the Epilogue of this book that human intelligence canonly be fully understood when we include spirit (“energy”) or what quantumphysics–savvy psychologists call the “superconscious” mind. But for the moment,I’d like to stick to the conscious and subconscious minds, concepts thatpsychologists and psychiatrists have long grappled with. I’m grappling with ithere to provide the biological foundation for conscious parenting as well asenergy-based psychological healing methods.Human Programming: When Good Mechanisms Go BadLet’s go back to the evolutionary challenge for human beings, who have to learnso much so quickly to survive and become a part of their social community.Evolution has endowed our brains with the ability to rapidly download anunimaginable number of behaviors and beliefs into our memory. Ongoing researchsuggests that a key to understanding how this rapid downloading of informationworks is the brain’s fluctuating electrical activity as measured byelectroencephalograms. The literal definition of electroencephalograms (EEGs) is“electric head pictures.” These increasingly sophisticated head pictures reveala graded range of brain activity in human beings. Both adults and childrendisplay EEG variations that range from low frequency delta waves through highfrequency beta waves. However, researchers have noted that EEG activity inchildren reveals, at every developmental stage, the predominance of a specificbrain wave.Dr. Rima Laibow in Quantitative EEG and Neurofeedback describes the progressionof these developmental stages in brain activity. (Laibow 1999 and 2002) Betweenbirth and two years of age, the human brain predominantly operates at the lowestEEG frequency, 0.5 to 4 cycles per second (Hz), known as delta waves. Thoughdelta is their predominant wave activity, babies can exhibit periodic shortbursts of higher EEG activity. A child begins to spend more time at a higherlevel of EEG activity characterized as theta (4-8 Hz) between two and six yearsof age. Hypnotherapists drop their patients’ brain activity into delta and thetabecause these low frequency brain waves put them into a more suggestible,programmable state.This gives us an important clue as to how children, whose brains are mostlyoperating at these same frequencies between birth and six years of age, candownload the incredible volume of information they need to thrive in theirenvironment. The ability to process this vast quantity of information is animportant neurologic adaptation to facilitate this information-intense processof enculturation. Human environments and social mores change so rapidly that itwould not be an advantage to transmit cultural behaviors via geneticallyprogrammed instincts. Young children carefully observe their environment anddownload the worldly wisdom offered by parents directly into their subconsciousmemory. As a result, their parents’ behavior and beliefs become their own.Researchers at Kyoto University’s Primate Research Institute have found thatbaby chimps also learn by simply observing their mothers. In a series ofexperiments, a mother was taught to identify the Japanese characters for avariety of colors. When the Japanese character for a specific color was flashedon a computer screen, the chimp learned to choose the right color swatch. Uponselecting the right color, the chimp received a coin that she could then put ina vending machine for a fruit treat. During her training process, she washolding her baby close. To the surprise of researchers, one day, as the motherwas retrieving her fruit from the vending machine, the infant chimp activatedthe computer. When the character appeared on the screen, the chimp selected thecorrect color, received a coin, and then followed his mother to the vendingmachine. The astonished researchers were left to conclude that infants can pickup complex skills solely by observation and don’t have to be actively coached bytheir parents. (Science 2001)In humans as well, the fundamental behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes we observein our parents become “hard-wired” as synaptic pathways in our subconsciousminds. Once programmed into the subconscious mind, they control our biology forthe rest of our lives … unless we can figure out a way to reprogram them. Anyonewho doubts the sophistication of this downloading should think about the firsttime your child blurted out a curse word picked up from you. I’m sure you notedits sophistication, correct pronunciation, its nuanced style, and contextcarrying your signature.Given the precision of this behavior-recording system, imagine the consequencesof hearing your parents say you are a “stupid child,” you “do not deservethings,” will “never amount to anything,” “never should have been born,” or area “sickly, weak” person. When unthinking or uncaring parents pass on thosemessages to their young children, they are no doubt oblivious to the fact thatsuch comments are downloaded into the subconscious memory as absolute “facts”just as surely as bits and bytes are downloaded to the hard drive of yourdesktop computer. During early development, the child’s consciousness has notevolved enough to critically assess that those parental pronouncements were onlyverbal barbs and not necessarily true characterizations of “self.” Onceprogrammed into the subconscious mind, however, these verbal abuses becomedefined as “truths” that unconsciously shape the behavior and potential of thechild through life.As we get older, we become less susceptible to outside programming with theincreasing appearance of higher frequency alpha waves (8-12 HZ). Alpha activityis equated with states of calm consciousness. While most of our senses, such aseyes, ears, and nose, observe the outer world, consciousness resembles a “senseorgan” that behaves like a mirror reflecting back the inner workings of thebody’s own cellular community; it is an awareness of “self.”At around twelve years of age, the child’s EEG spectrum begins to show sustainedperiods of an even higher frequency defined as beta waves (12-35 Hz). Beta brainstates are characterized as “active or focused consciousness,” the kind of brainactivity used in reading this book. Recently, a fifth, higher state of EEGactivity has been defined. Referred to as gamma waves (>35Hz), this EEGfrequency range kicks in during states of “peak performance,” such as whenpilots are in the process of landing a plane or a professional tennis player isengaged in a rapid-fire volley.By the time children reach adolescence, their subconscious minds are chock-fullof information that ranges from the knowledge of how to walk to the “knowledge”they will never amount to anything or the knowledge, fostered by loving parents,that they can do anything they set out to do. The sum of our geneticallyprogrammed instincts and the beliefs we learned from our parents collectivelyform the subconscious mind, which can undo both our ability to keep our armraised in a chiropractor’s office and our best New Year’s resolutions to stopsabotaging ourselves with drugs or food.Again I go back to cells, which can teach us so much about ourselves. I’ve saidmany times that single cells are intelligent. But remember, when cells bandtogether in creating multicellular communities, they follow the “collectivevoice” of the organism, even if that voice dictates self-destructive behavior.Our physiology and behavior patterns conform to the “truths” of the centralvoice, be they constructive or destructive beliefs.I’ve described the power of the subconscious mind, but I want to emphasize thatthere is no need to consider the subconscious a scary, super-powerful, Freudianfont of destructive “knowledge.” In reality, the subconscious is an emotionlessdatabase of stored programs, whose function is strictly concerned with readingenvironmental signals and engaging in hardwired behavioral programs, noquestions asked, no judgments made. The subconscious mind is a programmable“hard drive” into which our life experiences are downloaded. The programs arefundamentally hardwired stimulus-response behaviors. Behavior activating stimulimay be signals the nervous system detects from the external world and/or signalsthat arise from within the body such as emotions, pleasure, and pain. When astimulus is perceived, it will automatically engage the behavioral response thatwas learned when the signal was first experienced. In fact, people who realizethe automated nature of this playback response frequently admit to the fact thattheir “buttons have been pushed.”Before the evolution of the conscious mind, the functions of animal brainsconsisted only of those that we link with the subconscious mind. These moreprimitive minds were simple stimulus-response devices that automaticallyresponded to environmental stimuli by engaging genetically programmed(instincts) or simple learned behaviors. These animals do not “consciously”evoke such behaviors, and in fact, may even be oblivious to them. Theirbehaviors are programmed reflexes, like the blink of an eye in response to apuff of air or the kick of a leg after tapping the knee joint.The Conscious Mind: The Creator WithinThe evolution of higher mammals, including chimps, cetaceans, and humans,brought forth a new level of awareness called “self-consciousness,” or, simply,the conscious mind. The newer conscious mind is an important evolutionaryadvance. The earlier, subconscious mind is our “autopilot”; the conscious mindis our manual control. For example, if a ball comes near your eye, the slowerconscious mind may not have time to be aware of the threatening projectile. Yetthe subconscious mind, which processes some 20,000,000 environmental stimuli persecond v. 40 environmental stimuli interpreted by the conscious mind in the samesecond, will cause the eye to blink. (Norretranders 1998). The subconsciousmind, one of the most powerful information processors known, specificallyobserves both the surrounding world and the body’s internal awareness, reads theenvironmental cues, and immediately engages previously acquired (learned)behaviors—all without the help, supervision, or even awareness of the consciousmind.-1743744865 [images/9781401923112_0166_001.jpg]Visualizing the information-processing powers of the conscious and subconsciousminds. Consider that the image of Machu Picchu above is comprised of 20,000,000pixel dots, each representing a BIT of information received by the nervoussystem in one second. How much of that information enters the conscious mind? Inthe lower picture, the dot represents the total amount of information that isprocessed by the conscious mind. (Actually the dot is 10X more than entersconsciousness, I had to enlarge it because it was barely visible.) In contrast,the powerful subconscious mind processes all the remaining incoming information(the black area) in the same second.-1743744847 [images/9781401923112_0166_003.jpg]The two minds make a dynamic duo. Operating together, the conscious mind can useits resources to focus on some specific point, such as the party you are goingto on Friday night. Simultaneously, your subconscious mind can be safely pushingthe lawn mower around and successfully not cutting off your foot or running overthe cat—even though you are not consciously paying attention to mowing the lawn.The two minds also cooperate in acquiring very complex behaviors that cansubsequently be unconsciously managed. Remember the first day you excitedly satin the driver’s seat of a car, preparing to learn how to drive? The number ofthings that had to be dealt with by the conscious mind was staggering. Whilekeeping your eyes on the road, you had to also watch the rear and side viewmirrors; pay attention to the speedometer and other gauges; use two feet for thethree pedals of a standard shift vehicle; and try to be calm, cool, andcollected as you drove past observing peers. It took what seemed to be a longtime before all these behaviors were “programmed” into your mind.Today, you get in the car, turn the ignition on, and consciously review yourshopping list as the subconscious mind dutifully engages all the complex skillsyou need to successfully navigate through the city—without even once having tothink about the mechanics of driving. I know I am not the only one out there whohas experienced this. You are driving and having a delightful discussion withthe passenger sitting next to you. In fact, your consciousness gets so caught upin the conversation, that somewhere down the road it dawns on you that youhaven’t even paid attention to your driving for five minutes. After a momentarystart, you realize that you are still on your side of the road and steadilymoving along with the flow of traffic. A quick check of the rear view mirrorreveals that you did not leave a wake of crumpled stop signs and smashedmailboxes. If you weren’t consciously driving the car during that time, then whowas? The subconscious mind! And how well did it do? Although you didn’t observeits behavior, the subconscious mind apparently performed just as well as it wastaught during your driver’s education experience.In addition to facilitating subconscious habitual programs, the conscious mindalso has the power to be spontaneously creative in its responses toenvironmental stimuli. In its self-reflective capacity, the conscious mind canobserve behaviors as they’re being carried out. As a preprogrammed behavior isunfolding, the observing conscious mind can step in, stop the behavior, andcreate a new response. Thus the conscious mind offers us free will, meaning weare not just victims of our programming. To pull that off however, you have tobe fully conscious lest the programming take over, a difficult task, as anyonewho’s tried willpower can attest. Subconscious programming takes over the momentyour conscious mind is not paying attention.The conscious mind can also think forward and backward in time, while thesubconscious mind is always operating in the present moment. When the consciousmind is busy daydreaming, creating future plans, or reviewing past lifeexperiences, the subconscious mind is always on duty, efficiently managing thebehaviors required at the moment, without the need of conscious supervision.The two minds are truly a phenomenal mechanism, but here is how it can go awry.The conscious mind is the “self,” the voice of our own thoughts. It can havegreat visions and plans for a future filled with love, health, happiness, andprosperity. While we focus our consciousness on happy thoughts, who is runningthe show? The subconscious. How is the subconscious going to manage our affairs?Precisely the way it was programmed. The subconscious mind’s behaviors when weare not paying attention may not be of our own creation because most of ourfundamental behaviors were downloaded without question from observing otherpeople. Because subconscious-generated behaviors are not generally observed bythe conscious mind, many people are stunned to hear that they are “just liketheir mom or their dad,” the people who programmed their subconscious minds.The learned behaviors and beliefs acquired from other people, such as parents,peers, and teachers, may not support the goals of our conscious mind. Thebiggest impediments to realizing the successes of which we dream are thelimitations programmed into the subconscious. These limitations not onlyinfluence our behavior, they can also play a major role in determining ourphysiology and health. As we’ve seen, the mind plays a powerful role incontrolling the biological systems that keep us alive.Nature did not intend the presence of the dual minds to be our Achilles heel. Infact, this duality offers a wonderful advantage for our lives. Consider it thisway: what if we had conscious parents and teachers who served as wonderful lifemodels, always engaging in humane and win-win relations with everyone in thecommunity? If our subconscious mind were programmed with such healthy behaviors,we could be totally successful in our lives without ever being conscious!The Subconscious Mind:I Keep Calling and No One AnswersWhile the “thinking-self” nature of the conscious mind evokes images of a “ghostin the machine,” there is no similar self-awareness operating in thesubconscious mind. The latter mechanism is more akin to a jukebox loaded withbehavioral programs, each ready to play as soon as appropriate environmentalsignals appear and press the selection buttons. If we don’t like a particularsong in the jukebox, how much yelling at or arguing with the machine will causeit to reprogram its play list? In my college days, I saw many an inebriatedstudent, to no avail, curse and kick jukeboxes that were not responsive to theirrequests. Similarly, we must realize that no amount of yelling or cajoling bythe conscious mind can ever change the behavioral “tapes” programmed into thesubconscious mind. Once we realize the ineffectiveness of this tactic, we canquit engaging in a pitched battle with the subconscious mind and take a moreclinical approach to reprogramming it. Engaging the subconscious in battle is aspointless as kicking the jukebox in the hope that it will reprogram its playlist.The futility of battling with the subconscious is a hard message to get acrossbecause one of the programs most of us downloaded when we were young is that“willpower is admirable.” So we try over and over again to override thesubconscious program. Usually such efforts are met with varying degrees ofresistance because the cells are obligated to adhere to the subconsciousprogram.Tensions between conscious willpower and subconscious programs can result inserious neurological disorders. For me, a powerful image of why we should notchallenge the subconscious comes from the movie Shine. In the movie, based on atrue story, Australian concert pianist David Helfgott defies his father by goingoff to London to study music. Helfgott’s father, a survivor of the Holocaust,programmed his son’s subconscious mind with the belief that the world wasunsafe, that if he “stood out” it might be life threatening. His father insistedhe would be safe only if he stayed close to his family. In spite of his father’srelentless programming, Helfgott knew that he was a world-class pianist whoneeded to break from his father to realize his dream.In London, Helfgott played the notoriously difficult Third Piano Concerto ofRachmaninoff in a competition. The film shows the conflict between his consciousmind wanting success and his subconscious mind concerned that being visible,being internationally recognized, was life-threatening. As he labors through theconcerto, sweat pouring from his brow, Helfgott’s conscious mind fights to stayin control, while his subconscious mind, fearful of winning, tries to takecontrol of his body. Helfgott consciously forces himself to maintain controlthrough the concerto until he plays the last note. He then passes out, overcomeby the energy it took to battle his subconscious programming. For that “victory”over the subconscious, he pays a high price: when he comes to, he is insane.Most of us engage in less dramatic battles with our subconscious mind as we tryto undo the programming we received as children. Witness our ability tocontinually seek out jobs that we fail at, or remain in jobs we hate, because wedon’t “deserve” a better life.Conventional methods for suppressing destructive behaviors include drugs andtalk therapy. Newer approaches promise to change our programming, recognizingthat there is no use “reasoning” with the subconscious tape player. Thesemethods capitalize on the findings of quantum physics that connect energy andthought. In fact, these modalities that reprogram previously learned behaviorscan be collectively referred to as energy psychology, a burgeoning field basedon the New Biology.But how much easier would it be to be nurtured from the beginning of life sothat you can reach your genetic and creative potential? How much better tobecome a conscious parent so that your children and their children will beconscious parents, making reprogramming unnecessary and making for a happier,more peaceful planet!A Twinkle in Your Parents’ Eyes:Conscious Conception & Conscious PregnancyYou all know the expression, “When you were only a twinkle in your parents’eyes.” A phrase that conjures up the happiness of loving parents who truly wantto conceive a child. It turns out it is also a phrase that sums up the latestgenetic research suggesting that parents should cultivate that twinkle in themonths before they conceive a child. That growth-promoting awareness andintention can produce a smarter, healthier, and happier baby.Research reveals that parents act as genetic engineers for their children in themonths before conception. In the final stages of egg and sperm maturation, aprocess called genomic imprinting adjusts the activity of specific groups ofgenes that will shape the character of the child yet to be conceived. (Surani2001; Reik and Walter 2001) Research suggests that what is going on in the livesof the parents during the process of genomic imprinting has a profound influenceon the mind and body of their child, a scary thought given how unprepared mostpeople are to have a baby. Verny writes in Pre-Parenting: Nurturing Your Childfrom Conception: “It makes a difference whether we are conceived in love, haste,or hate and whether a mother wants to be pregnant … parents do better when theylive in a calm and stable environment free of addictions and supported by familyand friends.” (Verny and Weintraub 2002) Interestingly, aboriginal cultures haverecognized the influence of the conception environment for millennia. Prior toconceiving a child, couples ceremonially purify their minds and bodies.Once the child is conceived, an impressive body of research is documenting howimportant parents’ attitudes are in the development of the fetus. Again Vernywrites: “In fact, the great weight of the scientific evidence that has emergedover the last decade demands that we reevaluate the mental and emotionalabilities of unborn children. Awake or asleep, the studies show, they (unbornchildren) are constantly tuned in to their mother’s every action, thought, andfeeling. From the moment of conception, the experience in the womb shapes thebrain and lays the groundwork for personality, emotional temperament, and thepower of higher thought.”Now is the time to stress that the New Biology is not a return to the old daysof blaming mothers for every ailment that medicine didn’t understand—fromschizophrenia to autism. Mothers and fathers are in the conception and pregnancybusiness together, even though it is the mother who carries the child in herwomb. What the father does profoundly affects the mother, which in turn affectsthe developing child. For example, if the father leaves and the mother startsquestioning her own ability to survive, his leaving profoundly changes theinteraction between the mother and the unborn baby. Similarly, societal factors,such as lack of employment, housing, and healthcare or endless wars that pullfathers into the military, can affect the parents and thus the developing child.The essence of conscious parenting is that both mothers and fathers haveimportant responsibilities for fostering healthy, intelligent, productive, andjoy-filled children. We surely cannot blame ourselves nor our parents forfailures in our own or our children’s lives. Science has kept our attentionfocused on the notion of genetic determinism, leaving us ignorant about theinfluence beliefs have on our lives and more importantly, how our behaviors andattitudes program the lives of our children.Most obstetricians are also still uneducated about the importance of parentalattitudes in the development of the baby. According to the notion of geneticdeterminism that they were steeped in as medical students, fetal development ismechanically controlled by genes with little additional contribution from themother. Consequently, ob-gyns are only concerned with a few maternal prenatalissues: Is she eating well? Taking vitamins? Does she exercise regularly? Thosequestions focus on what they believe is the mother’s principal role, theprovision of nutrients to be used by the genetically programmed fetus.But the developing child receives far more than nutrients from the mother’sblood. Along with nutrients, the fetus absorbs excess glucose if the mother isdiabetic and excess cortisol and other fight or flight hormones if the mother ischronically stressed. Research now offers insights into how the system works. Ifa mother is under stress, she activates her HPA axis, which provides fight orflight responses in a threatening environment.Stress hormones prepare the body to engage in a protection response. Once thesematernal signals enter the fetal blood stream, they affect the same targettissues and organs in the fetus as they did in the mother. In stressfulenvironments, fetal blood preferentially flows to the muscles and hindbrain,providing nutritional requirements needed by the arms and legs and by the regionof the brain responsible for life-saving reflex behavior. In supporting thefunction of the protection-related systems, blood flow is shunted from theviscera organs and stress hormones suppress forebrain function. The developmentof fetal tissue and organs is proportional to both the amount of blood theyreceive and the function they provide. When passing through the placenta, thehormones of a mother experiencing chronic stress will profoundly alter thedistribution of blood flow in her fetus and change the character of herdeveloping child’s physiology. (Lesage, et al, 2004; Christensen 2000; Arnsten1998; Leutwyler 1998; Sapolsky 1997; Sandman, et al, 1994)At the University of Melbourne, E. Marilyn Wintour’s research on pregnant sheep,who are physiologically quite similar to humans, has found that prenatalexposure to cortisol eventually leads to high blood pressure (Dodic, et al,2002). Fetal cortisol levels play a very important regulatory role in thedevelopment of the kidney’s filtering units, the nephrons. A nephron’s cells areintimately involved with regulating the body’s salt balance and consequently areimportant in controlling blood pressure. Excess cortisol absorbed from astressed mother modifies fetal nephron formation. An additional effect of excesscortisol is that it simultaneously switches the mother’s and the fetus’s systemfrom a growth state to a protection posture. As a result, the growth-inhibitingeffect of excess cortisol in the womb causes the babies to be born smaller.Suboptimal conditions in the womb that lead to low birth-weight babies have beenlinked to a number of adult ailments that Nathanielsz outlines in his book LifeIn The Womb, (Nathanielsz 1999) including diabetes, heart disease and obesity.For example, Dr. David Barker (ibid.) of England’s University of Southampton hasfound that a male who weighs fewer than 5.5 pounds at birth has a 50 percentgreater chance of dying of heart disease than one with a higher birth weight.Harvard researchers have found that women who weigh fewer than 5.5 pounds atbirth have a 23 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease than women bornheavier. And David Leon (ibid.) of the London School of Hygiene and TropicalMedicine has found that diabetes is three times more common in 60-year-old menwho were small and thin at birth.The new focus on the influences of the prenatal environment extends to the studyof IQ, which genetic determinists and racists once linked simply to genes. Butin 1997, Bernie Devlin, a professor of psychiatry at the University ofPittsburgh School of Medicine, carefully analyzed 212 earlier studies thatcompared the IQs of twins, siblings, and parents and their children. Heconcluded that genes account for only forty-eight percent of the factors thatdetermine IQ. And when the synergistic effects of mingling the mother andfather’s genes are factored in, the true inherited component of intelligenceplummets even further, to thirty-four percent. (Devlin, et al, 1997; McGue 1997)Devlin, on the other hand, found that conditions during prenatal developmentsignificantly impact IQ. He reveals that up to fifty-one percent of a child’spotential intelligence is controlled by environmental factors. Previous studieshad already found that drinking or smoking during pregnancy can cause decreasedIQ in children, as can exposure to lead in the womb. The lesson for people whowant to be parents is that you can radically shortchange the intelligence ofyour child simply by the way you approach pregnancy. These IQ changes are notaccidents; they are directly linked to altered blood flow in a stressed brain.In my lectures on conscious parenting, I cite research, but I also show a videofrom an Italian conscious parenting organization, Associazione NazionaleEducazione Prenatale, which graphically illustrates the interdependentrelationship between parents and their unborn child. In this video, a mother andfather engage in a loud argument while the woman is undergoing a sonogram. Youcan vividly see the fetus jump when the argument starts. The startled fetusarches its body and jumps up, as if it were on a trampoline when the argument ispunctuated with the shattering of glass. The power of modern technology, in theform of a sonogram, helps to lay to rest the myth that the unborn child is not asophisticated enough organism to react to anything other than its nutritionalenvironment.Nature’s Head Start ProgramYou may be wondering why evolution would provide such a system for fetaldevelopment that seems so fraught with peril and is so dependent on theenvironment of the parents. Actually, it’s an ingenious system that helps ensurethe survival of your offspring. Eventually, the child is going to find itself inthe same environment as its parents. Information acquired from the parents’perception of their environment transits the placenta and primes the prenate’sphysiology, preparing it to more effectively deal with future exigencies thatwill be encountered after birth. Nature is simply preparing that child to bestsurvive in that environment. However, armed with the latest science, parents nowhave a choice. They can carefully reprogram their limiting beliefs about lifebefore they bring a child into their world.The importance of parental programming undermines the notion that our traits,both positive and negative, are fully determined by our genes. As we have seen,genes are shaped, guided, and tailored by environmental learning experiences. Wehave all been led to believe that artistic, athletic, and intellectual prowessare traits simply passed on by genes. But no matter how “good” one’s genes maybe, if an individual’s nurture experiences are fraught with abuse, neglect, ormisperceptions, the realization of the genes’ potentials will be sabotaged. LizaMinnelli acquired her genes from her superstar mother Judy Garland and herfather filmmaker Vincent Minnelli. Liza’s career, the heights of her stardom,and the lows of her personal life are scripts that were played out by herparents and downloaded into her subconscious mind. If Liza had the same genesbut was raised by a nurturing Pennsylvania Dutch farming family, thatenvironment would have epigenetically triggered a different selection of genes.The genes that enabled her to pursue a successful entertainment career wouldhave likely been masked or inhibited by the cultural demands of her agrariancommunity.A wonderful example of the effectiveness of conscious parenting programming issuperstar golfer Tiger Woods. Although his father was not an accomplishedgolfer, he made every effort to immerse Tiger in an environment that was richwith opportunities to develop and enhance the mindset, skills, attitudes, andfocus of a master golfer. No doubt, Tiger’s success is also intimately connectedwith the Buddhist philosophy that his mother contributed. Indeed, genes areimportant—but their importance is only realized through the influence ofconscious parenting and the richness of opportunities provided by theenvironment.Conscious Mothering and FatheringI used to close my public lectures with the admonition that we are personallyresponsible for everything in our lives. Such a closure did not make me popularwith the audience. That responsibility was too much for many people to accept.After one lecture, an older woman in the audience was so distressed by myconclusion that she brought her husband backstage and in tears vehementlycontested my conclusion. She did not want any part of some of the tragedies shehad experienced. This woman convinced me that my summary conclusion had to bemodified. I realized that I didn’t want to contribute to foisting blame andguilt on any individual. As a society, we are too apt to wallow in guilt orscapegoat others for our problems. As we gain insights over a lifetime, webecome better equipped to take charge of our lives.After some deliberation, this woman from the audience happily accepted thefollowing resolution: you are personally responsible for everything in yourlife, once you become aware that you are personally responsible for everythingin your life. One cannot be “guilty” of being a poor parent unless one isalready aware of the above-described information and disregards it. Once youbecome aware of this information, you can begin to apply it to reprogram yourbehavior.And while we’re on the subject of myths about parenting, it is absolutely nottrue that you are the same parent for all of your children. Your second child isnot a clone of the first child. The same things are not happening in your worldthat happened when the first child was born. As I said above, I once thoughtthat I was the same parent for my first child as I was for my very differentsecond child. But when I analyzed my parenting, I found that was not true. Whenmy first child was born, I was at the beginning of my graduate school training,which was for me, a difficult transition fraught with a high workloadaccompanied by high insecurity. By the time my second daughter was born, I was amore confident, more accomplished research scientist ready to start my academiccareer. I had more time and more psychic energy to parent my second child and tobetter parent my first daughter, who was now a toddler.Another myth I’d like to address is that infants need lots of stimulation in theform of black and white flash cards or other learning tools marketed to parentsto increase the intelligence of their children. Michael Mendizza and JosephChilton Pearce’s inspiring book Magical Parent-Magical Child makes it clear thatplay not programming is the key to optimizing the learning and performance ofinfants and children. (Mendizza and Pearce 2001) Children need parents who canplayfully foster the curiosity, creativity, and wonder that accompanies theirchildren into the world.Obviously, what humans need is nurture in the form of love and the ability toobserve older humans going about their everyday lives. When babies inorphanages, for example, are kept in cribs and only provided with food but notone-on-one smiles and hugs, they develop long-lasting developmental problems.One study of Romanian orphans by Mary Carlson, a neurobiologist at HarvardMedical School, concluded that the lack of touching and attention in Romanianorphanages and poor-quality day care centers stunted the children’s growth andadversely affected their behavior. Carl-son, who studied sixty Romanian childrenfrom a few months to three years of age, measured their cortisol levels byanalyzing samples of saliva. The more stressed a child was, as determined by thehigher than normal levels of cortisol in its blood, the poorer the outcome forthe child. (Holden 1996)Carlson and others have also done research on monkeys and rats demonstratingcrucial links among touch, the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol, andsocial development. Studies by James W. Prescott, former director of theNational Institutes of Health’s section on Human Health and Child Development,revealed that newborn monkeys deprived of physical contact with their mothers orsocial contact with others, develop abnormal stress profiles and become violentsociopaths. (Prescott 1996 and 1990)He followed up these studies with an assessment of human cultures based on howthey raise their children. He found that if a society physically held and lovedits children and did not repress sexuality, that culture was peaceful. Peacefulcultures feature parents who maintain extensive, physical contact with theirchildren, such as carrying their babies on their chests and backs throughout theday. In contrast, societies that deprive their infants, children, andadolescents of extensive touch are inevitably violent in nature. One of thedifferences between populations is that many of the children not receiving touchsuffer from somatosensory affective disorder. This disorder is characterized byan inability to physiologically suppress surging levels of stress hormones, aprecursor to violent episodes.These findings provide insight into the violence that pervades the UnitedStates. Rather than endorsing physical closeness, our current medical andpsychological practices often discourage it. From the unnatural intervention ofmedical doctors in the natural process of birthing, for example, separating theneonate for extensive periods from the parents into distant nurseries, and theadvising of parents not to respond to their babies cries for fear of spoilingthem. Such practices, presumably based upon “science,” undoubtedly contribute tothe violence in our civilization. The research regarding touch and itsrelationship to violence is described in full at the following website:www.violence.de [http://www.violence.de].But what about the Romanian children who come out of deprived backgrounds andbecome what one researcher called “the resilient wonders”? Why do some childrenthrive despite their backgrounds? Because they have “better” genes? By now youknow that I don’t believe that. More likely, the birth parents of theseresilient wonders provided a more nurturing pre- and perinatal environment aswell as good nutrition at crucial points in the child’s development.The lesson for adoptive parents is that they should not pretend their children’slives began when they came into their new surroundings. Their children may havealready been programmed by their birth parents with a belief that they areunwanted or unlovable. If more fortunate, they may have, at some crucial age intheir development, received positive, life-affirming messages from theircaretakers. If adoptive parents are not aware of pre- and perinatal programming,they may not deal realistically with post-adoption issues. They may not realizethat their children did not come to them as a “blank slate” anymore thannewborns come into the world as blank slates, unaffected by their nine months intheir mother’s womb. Better to recognize that programming and to work, ifnecessary, to change it.For adoptive and non-adoptive parents alike, the message is clear: Yourchildren’s genes reflect only their potential, not their destiny. It is up toyou to provide the environment that allows them to develop to their highestpotential.Notice I do not say that it is up to parents to read lots of parenting books.I’ve met lots of people who are intellectually attracted to the ideas I presentin this book. But intellectual interest is not enough. I tried that myself. Iwas intellectually aware of everything in this book, but before I made theeffort to change, it made no impact on my life. If you simply read this book andthink that your life and your children’s lives will change, you’re doing theequivalent of accepting the latest pharmaceutical pill thinking it will “fix”everything. No one is fixed until they make the effort to change.Here is my challenge to you. Let go of unfounded fears and take care not toimplant unnecessary fears and limiting beliefs in your children’s subconsciousminds. Most of all, do not accept the fatalistic message of genetic determinism.You can help your children reach their potential and you can change yourpersonal life. You are not “stuck” with your genes.Take heed of the growth and protection lessons from cells and shift your livesinto growth whenever possible. And remember that for human beings the mostpotent growth promoter is not the fanciest school, the biggest toy, or thehighest-paying job. Long before cell biology and studies of children inorphanages, conscious parents and seers like Rumi knew that for human babies andadults the best growth promoter is love.A lifetime without Love is of no accountLove is the Water of LifeDrink it down with heart and soul"},{"pageContent":"Epilogue [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3311]-1743744354 [images/9781401923112_0182_002.jpg]SPIRIT AND SCIENCEThe most beautiful and profound emotion we can experience is the sensation ofthe mystical. It is the power of all true science.— Albert EinsteinWe’ve come a long way since Chapter 1, when I faced my panicked medical studentsand started my journey to the New Biology. But throughout the book I have notstrayed far from the theme I introduced in the first chapter—that smart cellscan teach us how to live. Now that we’re at the end of the book, I’d like toexplain how my study of cells turned me into a spiritual person. I also want toexplain why I am optimistic about the fate of our planet, though I concede thatoptimism is sometimes hard to maintain if you read the daily newspaper.I’ve specifically separated my discussion of Spirit and Science from thepreceding chapters of the book by entitling this section the Epilogue. Anepilogue is generally a short section at the end of the work that details thefate of its character … in this case moi. When the awareness that prompted thisbook first came into my head twenty years ago, I saw something in it that was soprofound it immediately transformed my life. In the first instant of my big“aha,” my brain was reveling in the beauty of the newly envisioned mechanics ofthe cell membrane. A few heartbeats later I was overtaken by a joy that was sodeep and wide, my heart ached and tears flowed from my eyes. The mechanics ofthe new science revealed the existence of our spiritual essence and ourimmortality. For me, the conclusions were so unambiguous that I instantly wentfrom nonbeliever to believer.I know that for some of you the conclusions I am going to present in thissection are too speculative. Conclusions drawn in the previous chapters of thebook are based upon a quarter of a century of studying cloned cells and aregrounded in the astonishing new discoveries that are rewriting our understandingof the mysteries of life. The conclusions I offer in this epilogue are alsobased upon my scientific training—they do not spring from a leap of religiousfaith. I know conventional scientists may shy away from them because theyinvolve Spirit, but I am confident in presenting them for two reasons.One reason is a philosophical and scientific rule called Occam’s razor. Occam’srazor holds that when several hypotheses are offered to explain a phenomenon,the simplest hypothesis that accounts for most of the observations is the mostlikely hypothesis and should be considered first. The new science of the magicalmem-Brain in conjunction with the principles of quantum physics offer thesimplest explanation that accounts for the science of not only allopathicmedicine but also for the philosophy and practice of complementary medicine andspiritual healing as well. Also, after so many years of personally applying thescience I have outlined in this book, I can attest to its power to change lives.However, I concede that while science led me to my euphoric moment of insight,the experience resembled instantaneous conversions described by mystics.Remember the biblical story of Saul who was knocked off his horse with alightning bolt? For me, there was no lightning bolt that came forth from theCaribbean skies. But I ran wild-eyed into the medical library because the natureof the cell’s membrane that was “downloaded” into my awareness in the wee hoursof the morning convinced me that we are immortal, spiritual beings who existseparately from our bodies. I had heard an undeniable inner voice informing methat I was leading a life based not only on the false premise that genes controlbiology but also on the false premise that we end when our physical bodies die.I had spent years studying molecular control mechanisms within the physical bodyand at that astounding moment came to realize that the protein “switches” thatcontrol life are primarily turned on and off by signals from the environment …the Universe.You may be surprised that it was science that led me to that moment of spiritualinsight. In scientific circles, the word “spirit” is as warmly embraced as theword “evolution” is in fundamentalist circles.As you know, spiritualists and scientists approach life in vastly differentways. When life is out of whack for spiritualists, they beseech God or someother invisible force for relief. When life is out of whack for scientists, theyrun to the medicine cabinet for a chemical. It is only with a drug like Rolaidsthat they are able to spell relief.The fact that science led me to spiritual insight is appropriate because thelatest discoveries in physics and cell research are forging new links betweenthe worlds of Science and Spirit. These realms were split apart in the days ofDescartes centuries ago. However, I truly believe that only when Spirit andScience are reunited will we be afforded the means to create a better world.A Time of ChoiceThe latest science leads us to a worldview not unlike that held by the earliestcivilizations, in which every material object in nature was thought to possess aspirit. The Universe is still thought of as One by the small number ofaborigines who survive. Aboriginal cultures do not make the usual distinctionsamong rocks, air, and humans; all are imbued with spirit, the invisible energy.Doesn’t this sound familiar? This is the world of quantum physics, in whichmatter and energy are completely entangled. And it is the world of Gaia that Ispoke of in Chapter 1, a world in which the whole planet is considered to be oneliving, breathing organism, which needs to be protected from human greed,ignorance, and poor planning.Never have we needed the insights of such a worldview more. When Science turnedaway from Spirit, its mission dramatically changed. Instead of trying tounderstand the “natural order” so that human beings can live in harmony withthat order, modern science embarked on a goal of control and domination ofnature. The technology that has resulted from pursuing this philosophy hasbrought human civilization to the brink of spontaneous combustion by disruptingthe web of nature. The evolution of our biosphere has been punctuated by five“mass extinctions,” including the one that killed the dinosaurs. Each wave ofextinction nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Some researchers believe, asI mentioned in Chapter 1, that we are “deep” into the sixth mass extinction.Unlike the others caused by galactic forces such as comets, the currentextinction is being caused by a force much closer to home—humans. As you sit onyour porch and watch the sunset, note its spectacular color. The beauty in thesky reflects the pollution in the air. As the world we know decays, the Earthpromises us an even greater light show.Meanwhile we are leading lives without a moral context. The modern world hasshifted from spiritual aspirations to a war for material accumulation. The onewith the most toys wins. My favorite image for the scientists and technologistswho have led us into this spiritless world comes from the Disney movie,Fantasia. Remember Mickey Mouse as the hapless apprentice to a powerfulsorcerer? The sorcerer instructs Mickey to do the chores of the lab while he isaway. One of the chores is to fill a giant cistern with water from a nearbywell. Mickey, who had been observing the sorcerer’s magic, tries to bypass thechore by applying a spell to a broom, which turns it into a waterbucket-carryinglackey.When Mickey falls asleep, the robotic broom fills and then overfills thecistern, flooding the lab. Upon awakening, Mickey tries to stop the broom. Buthis knowledge is so limited, he fails and the situation gets even worse. Thewater takes over, until the sorcerer, who does have the knowledge to quiet thebroom, returns and restores balance. Here’s how Mickey’s predicament isdescribed in the movie: “This piece is a legend about a sorcerer who had anapprentice. He was a bright young lad, very anxious to learn the business. As amatter of fact, he was a little too bright because he had started practicingsome of the boss’s magic tricks before learning how to control them.” Today’svery bright scientists are “Mickey Mousing around” with our genes and ourenvironment without understanding how interconnected everything on this planetis—a course of action bound to have tragic results.How did we get to this point? There was a time when it was necessary forscientists to split from Spirit, or at least the corruption of Spirit by theChurch. This powerful institution was in the business of suppressing scientificdiscovery when it was at odds with Church dogma. It was Nicolaus Copernicus, asavvy politician as well as a gifted astronomer, who launched the Spirit/Sciencesplit when he released to the public his profound manuscript De revolutionibusorbium coelestium (On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres). The 1543manuscript boldly declared that the sun, not the Earth, was the center of the“Heavenly Spheres.” This is obvious today, but in Copernicus’ time it was heresybecause his new cosmology was at odds with an “infallible” Church, which haddeclared the Earth to be the center of God’s firmament. Copernicus believed thatthe Inquisition would destroy both him and his heretical beliefs, so heprudently waited until he was on his deathbed to publish his work. His concernfor his safety was fully justified. Fifty-seven years later Giordano Bruno, aDominican monk who had the temerity to speak out and defend Copernicus’cosmology, was burned at the stake for this heresy. Copernicus outsmarted theChurch—it is hard to torture an intellectual when he is in his grave. Unable tokill the messenger, the Church eventually had to deal with Copernicus’s message.A century later French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes insisted onusing scientific methodology to examine the validity of all previously accepted“truths.” The invisible forces of the spiritual world clearly didn’t lendthemselves to such analysis. In the post-Reformation era, scientists wereencouraged to pursue their studies of the natural world and spiritual “truths”were relegated to the realms of religion and metaphysics. Spirit and othermetaphysical concepts were devalued as “unscientific” because their truths couldnot be assessed by the analytic methods of science. The important “stuff” aboutlife and the Universe became the domain of rational scientists.If the Spirit/Science split needed any more reinforcement, it got it in 1859when Darwin’s theory of evolution made an instant splash. Darwin’s theory spreadacross the globe like today’s Internet rumors. It was readily accepted becauseits principles dovetailed with people’s experiences in breeding pets, farmanimals, and plants. Darwinism attributed the origins of humanity to thehappenstance of hereditary variations, which meant that there was no need toinvoke divine intervention in our lives or our science. Modern scientists wereno less awed by the Universe than the cleric/ scientists who preceded them, butwith Darwin’s theory in hand they no longer saw a need to invoke the Hand of Godas a grand “designer” of nature’s complex order. Preeminent Darwinist Ernst Mayrwrote: “When we ask how this perfection is brought about, we seem to find onlyarbitrariness, planlessness, randomness, and accident … ” (Mayr 1976)While Darwinian theory specifies that the purpose of life’s struggles issurvival, it does not specify a means that should be used in securing that end.Apparently, “anything goes” in the perceived struggle because the goal is simplysurvival—by any means. Rather than framing the character of our lives by thelaws of morality, the neo-Darwinism of Mayr suggests that we live our lives bythe law of the jungle. Neo-Darwinism essentially concludes that those who havemore deserve it. In the West, we have accepted the inevitability of acivilization that is characterized by the “haves” and the “have-nots.” We don’twant to deal with the fact that everything in this world has a price.Unfortunately this includes, along with the ailing planet, the homeless, as wellas the child laborers who sew our designer jeans … they are the losers in thisstruggle.We Are Made in the Image of the UniverseOn that early morning in the Caribbean, I realized that even the “winners” inour Darwinian world are losers because we are one with a bigger Universe/God.The cell engages in behavior when its brain, the membrane, responds toenvironmental signals. In fact, every functional protein in our body is made asa complementary “image” of an environmental signal. If a protein did not have acomplementary signal to couple with, it would not function. This means, as Iconcluded in that “aha!” moment, that every protein in our bodies is aphysical/electromagnetic complement to something in the environment. Because weare machines made out of protein, by definition we are made in the image of theenvironment, that environment being the Universe, or to many, God.Back to the winners and losers. Because humans evolved as complements of theirsurrounding environment, if we change the environment too much, we will nolonger be complementary to it … we won’t “fit.” At the moment, humans arealtering the planet so dramatically that we are threatening our own survival aswell as the survival of other, rapidly disappearing organisms. That threatencompasses Hummer drivers and fast food moguls with lots of money, the“winners,” along with poverty-stricken laborers, the “losers,” in thiscompetition for survival. There are two ways out of this dilemma: to die ormutate. I think you should seriously ponder this as the need to sell Big Macsleads us to decimate the rain forests, as the staggering numbers of gas-guzzlingvehicles foul the air, or as petrochemical industries erode the Earth andpollute the water. We were designed by nature to fit an environment but not theenvironment we are now making.I learned from cells that we are part of a whole and that we forget this at ourperil. But I also recognized that each one of us has a unique, biologicalidentity. Why? What makes each person’s cellular community unique? On thesurface of our cells is a family of identity receptors, which distinguish oneindividual from another.A well-studied subset of these receptors, called self-receptors, or humanleukocytic antigens (HLA), are related to the functions of the immune system. Ifyour self-receptors were to be removed, your cells would no longer reflect youridentity. These self-receptor-less cells would still be human cells, but withoutan identity they would simply be generic human cells. Put your personal set ofself-receptors back on the cells and they again reflect your identity.When you donate an organ, the closer your set of self-receptors matches thereceptors of the person who is to receive the organ, the less aggressive therejection reaction launched by the recipient’s immune system. For example, let’ssay that a set of 100 different self-receptors on the surface of each cell isused to identify you as an individual. You are in need of an organ graft tosurvive. When my set of 100 self-receptors is compared to your self-receptors,it turns out that we have only 10 receptors that match. I would not be a greatorgan donor for you. The very dissimilar nature of our self-receptors revealsthat our identities are very different. The vast difference in membranereceptors would mobilize your immune system, shifting it into hyper-drive toeliminate the foreign, i.e., not-self, transplanted cells. You would have agreater chance of success if you could find a donor whose self-receptors moreclosely match the ones on your cells.In your search for a better donor, however, you will not find a perfect 100percent match. So far scientists have never found two individuals who arebiologically the same. However, it is theoretically possible to create universaldonor tissues when you remove the cells’ self-receptors, though scientists haveyet to carry out such an experiment. In such an experiment, the cells would losetheir identity. These self-receptor-less cells would not be rejected. Whilescientists have focused on the nature of these immune-related receptors, it isimportant to note that it is not the protein receptors but what activates thereceptors that give individuals their identity. Each cell’s unique set ofidentify receptors are located on the membrane’s outer surface, where they actas “antennas,” downloading complementary environmental signals. These identityreceptors read a signal of “self,” which does not exist within the cell butcomes to it from the external environmental.Consider the human body a television set. You are the image on the screen. Butyour image did not come from inside the television. Your identity is anenvironmental broadcast that was received via an antenna. One day you turn onthe TV and the picture tube has blown out. Your first reaction would be, “Oh,#*$?!! The television is dead.” But did the image die along with the televisionset? To answer that question you get another television set, plug it in, turn iton, and tune it to the station you were watching before the picture tube blewout. This exercise will demonstrate that the broadcast image is still on theair, even though your first television “died.” The death of the television asthe receiver in no way killed the identity broadcast that comes from theenvironment.In this analogy, the physical television is the equivalent of the cell. The TV’santenna, which downloads the broadcast, represents our full set of identifyingreceptors and the broadcast represents an environmental signal. Because of ourpreoccupation with the material Newtonian world, we might at first assume thatthe cell’s protein receptors are the “self.” That would be the equivalent ofbelieving that the TV’s antenna is the source of the broadcast. The cell’sreceptors are not the source of its identity but the vehicle by which the “self”is downloaded from the environment.When I fully understood this relationship I realized that my identity, my“self,” exists in the environment whether my body is here or not. Just as in theTV analogy, if my body dies and in the future a new individual (biological“television set”) is born who has the same exact set of identity receptors, thatnew individual will be downloading “me.” I will once again be present in theworld. When my physical body dies, the broadcast is still present. My identityis a complex signature contained within the vast information that collectivelycomprises the environment.Supporting evidence for my belief that an individual’s broadcast is stillpresent even after death comes from transplant patients who report that alongwith their new organs come behavioral and psychological changes. Oneconservative, health-conscious New Englander, Claire Sylvia, was astonished whenshe developed a taste for beer, chicken nuggets, and motorcycles after herheart-lung transplant. Sylvia talked to the donor’s family and found she had theheart of an eighteen-year-old motorcycle enthusiast who loved chicken nuggetsand beer. In her book called A Change of Heart, Sylvia outlines her personaltransformational experiences, as well as similar experiences of other patientsin her transplant support group. (Sylvia and Novak 1997) Paul P. Pearsallpresents a number of other such stories in his book, The Heart’s Code: Tappingthe Wisdom and Power of Our Heart Energy. (Pearsall 1998) The accuracy ofmemories that accompany these transplants is beyond chance or coincidence. Oneyoung girl began having nightmares of murder after her heart transplant. Herdreams were so vivid that they led to the capture of the murderer who killed herdonor.One theory about how these new behaviors become implanted into the transplantrecipient along with the organ is “cellular memory,” i.e., the notion thatsomehow memories are embedded in cells. You know I have immense respect for theintelligence of single cells, but I have to draw a line here. Yes, cells can“remember” that they are muscle cells or liver cells, but there is a limit totheir intelligence. I do not believe cells are physically endowed withperception mechanisms that can distinguish and remember a taste for chickennuggets!Psychological and behavioral memory does make sense if we realize that thetransplanted organs still bear the original identity receptors of the donor andare apparently still downloading that same environmental information. Eventhough the body of the person who donated the organs is dead, their broadcast isstill on. They are, as I realized in my flash of insight while mulling over themechanics of the cellular membrane—immortal, as I believe we all are.Cells and organ transplants offer a model not only for immortality but also forreincarnation. Consider the possibility that an embryo in the future displaysthe same set of identity receptors that I now possess. That embryo will be tunedinto my “self.” My identity is back but playing through a different body. Sexismand racism become ridiculous as well as immoral when you realize that yourreceptors could wind up on a white person, a black person, an Asian, or a maleor female. Because the environment represents “All That Is” (God) and ourself-receptor antennas download only a narrow band of the whole spectrum, we allrepresent a small part of the whole … a small part of God.Earth LandersWhile the TV analogy is useful, it is not a complete one because a television isonly a playback device. In the course of our lives, what we do alters theenvironment. We change the environment simply by being here. So a more completeway of understanding our relationship to Spirit is to compare a human to theMartian rovers “Spirit” and “Opportunity” or the other NASA landers we have sentto the Moon and Mars. Humans are not yet able to go physically to Mars, but wereally want to know what it would be like to land on Mars. So we send up theequivalent of a human explorer. Although the Mars rovers don’t physicallyresemble a human, they have functions of humans. These vehicles have cameras,which are the “eyes” that see the planet. They have vibration detectors, whichare “ears” that hear the planet. They have chemical sensors, which “taste” theplanet, etc. So the lander is designed with sensors that can experience Marssomewhat as a human would experience it.But let’s look a little more closely at how the Mars rovers work. The rovershave antennas (“receptors”) that are tuned to receive information broadcasts bya human being in the form of a NASA controller. The Earth-bound controlleractually sends information that animates the Mariner on Mars. But theinformation is not a one-way street. The NASA controller also learns from thelander, because the vehicle transmits information about its Mars experiencesback to Earth. The NASA controller interprets the information about the lander’sexperiences and then applies that new awareness to better navigate the Martianterrain.You and I are like “Earth landers” who receive information from an environmentalcontroller/Spirit. As we live our lives, the experiences of our world are sentback to that controller, our Spirit. So the character of how you live your lifeinfluences the character of your “self.” This interaction corresponds to theconcept of karma. When we understand it, we must take heed of the life we liveon this planet because the consequences of our life last longer than our bodies.What we do during our lifetime can come back to haunt us or a future version ofourselves.In the end, these cellular insights serve to emphasize the wisdom of spiritualteachers throughout the ages. Each of us is a spirit in material form. Apowerful image for this spiritual truth is the way light interacts with a prism.When a beam of white light goes through a prism, the prism’s crystallinestructure refracts the exiting light so that it appears as a rainbow spectrum.Each color, though a component of the white light, is seen separately because ofits unique frequency. If you reverse this process by projecting a rainbowspectrum through the crystal, the individual frequencies will recombine, forminga beam of white light. Think of each human being’s identity as an individualcolor frequency within the rainbow spectrum. If we arbitrarily eliminate aspecific frequency, a color, because we don’t “like it,” and then try to put theremaining frequencies back through the prism, the exiting beam will no longer bewhite light. By definition, white light is composed of all of the frequencies.-1743743760 [images/9781401923112_0193_002.jpg]Many spiritual people anticipate the return of White Light to the planet. Theyimagine that it will come in the form of a unique individual like Buddha, Jesus,or Muhammad. However, from my newly acquired spirituality, I see that WhiteLight will only return to the planet when every human being recognizes everyother human being as an individual frequency of the White Light. As long as wekeep eliminating or devaluing other human beings we have decided we don’t like,i.e., destroying frequencies of the spectrum, we will not be able to experiencethe White Light. Our job is to protect and nurture each human frequency so thatthe White Light can return.Fractal Evolution—A Theory We Can Live WithI’ve explained why I am now a spiritual scientist. Now I’d like to explain why Iam an optimist. The story of evolution is, I believe, a story of repeatingpatterns. We are at a crisis point, but the planet has been here before.Evolution has been punctuated with upheavals, which virtually wiped out existingspecies, including the best-known casualties, the dinosaurs. Those upheavalswere directly linked to environmental catastrophes just as today’s crisis is. Asthe human population increases, we are competing for space with the otherorganisms with whom we share the planet. But the good news is that similarpressures in the past have brought into being a new way of living and will do soagain. We are concluding one evolutionary cycle and preparing to embark uponanother. As this cycle comes to an end, people are becoming understandablyapprehensive and alarmed by the failures in the structures that supportcivilization. I believe, however, that the “dinosaurs” that are currently rapingnature will become extinct. The survivors will be those who realize that ourthoughtless ways are destructive to the planet and to us.How can I be so sure? My certitude comes from my study of fractal geometry.Here’s a definition of geometry, which will explain why it is important forstudying the structure of our biosphere. Geometry is a mathematical assessmentof “the way the different parts of something fit together in relation to eachother.” Until 1975, the only geometry available for study was Euclidean, whichwas summarized in the thirteen-volume ancient Greek text, The Elements ofEuclid, written around 300 B.C. For spatially oriented students, Euclidiangeometry is easy to understand because it deals with structures like cubes andspheres and cones that can be mapped on graph paper.However, Euclidian geometry does not apply to nature. For example, you cannotmap a tree, a cloud, or a mountain using the mathematical formulas of thisgeometry. In nature, most organic and inorganic structures display moreirregular and chaotic-appearing patterns. These natural images can only becreated by using the recently discovered mathematics called fractal geometry.French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot launched the field of fractal mathematicsand geometry in 1975. Like quantum physics, fractal (fractional) geometry forcesus to consider those irregular patterns, a quirkier world of curvy shapes andobjects with more than three dimensions.The mathematics of fractals is amazingly simple because you need only oneequation, using only simple multiplication and addition. The same equation isthen repeated ad infinitum. For example, the “Mandelbrot set” is based on thesimple formula of taking a number, multiplying it by itself and then adding theoriginal number. The result of that equation is then used as the input of thesubsequent equation; the result of that equation is then used as the input forthe next equation and so on. The challenge is that even though each equationfollows the same formula, these equations must be repeated millions of times toactually visualize a fractal pattern. The manual labor and time needed tocomplete millions of equations prevented early mathematicians from recognizingthe value of fractal geometry. With the advent of powerful computers Mandelbrotwas able to define this new math.Inherent in the geometry of fractals is the creation of ever-repeating,“self-similar” patterns nested within one another. You can get a rough idea ofthe repeating shapes by picturing the eternally popular toy, hand-paintedRussian nesting dolls. Each smaller structure is a miniature, but notnecessarily an exact version of the larger form. Fractal geometry emphasizes therelationship between the patterns in a whole structure and the patterns seen inparts of a structure. For example, the pattern of twigs on a branch resemblesthe pattern of limbs branching off the trunk. The pattern of a major river lookslike the patterns of its smaller tributaries. In the human lung, the fractalpattern of branching along the bronchus repeats in the smaller bronchioles. Thearterial and venous blood vessels and the peripheral nervous system also displaysimilar repeating patterns.Are the repetitive images observed in nature simply coincidence? I believe theanswer is definitely “no.” To explain why I believe fractal geometry defines thestructure of life, let’s revisit two points.First, the story of evolution is, as I’ve emphasized many times in this book,the story of ascension to higher awareness. Second, in our study of themembrane, we defined the receptor-effector protein complex (IMPs) as thefundamental unit of awareness/ intelligence. Consequently, the morereceptor-effector proteins (the olives in our bread and butter sandwich model)an organism possesses, the more awareness it can have and the higher it is onthe evolutionary ladder.However, there are physical restrictions for increasing the number ofreceptor-effector proteins that can be packed into the cell’s membrane. The cellmembrane’s thickness measures seven to eight nanometers, the diameter of itsphospholipid bilayer. The average diameter of the receptor-effector “awareness”proteins is approximately the same as the phospholipids in which they areembedded. Because the membrane’s thickness is so tightly defined, you can’t cramin lots of IMPs by stacking them on top of one another. You’re stuck with aone-protein-thick layer. Consequently, the only option for increasing the numberof awareness proteins is to increase the surface area of the membrane.Let’s go back to our membrane “sandwich” model. More olives mean moreawareness—the more olives you can layer in the sandwich, the smarter thesandwich. Which has more intelligence capacity, a slice of cocktail rye or alarge slab of sour dough? The answer is simple: the larger the surface area ofthe bread, the greater the number of olives that can fit into the sandwich.Relating this analogy to biological awareness, the more membrane surface areathe cell has, the more protein “olives” it can manage. Evolution, the expansionof awareness, can then be physically defined by the increase of membrane surfacearea. Mathematical studies have found that fractal geometry is the best way toget the most surface area (membrane) within a three-dimensional space (cell).Therefore, evolution becomes a fractal affair. Repeating patterns in nature area necessity, not a coincidence, of “fractal” evolution.My point is not to get caught up in the mathematical details of the modeling.There are repetitive fractal patterns in nature and in evolution as well. Thestrikingly beautiful, computer-generated pictures that illustrate fractalpatterns should remind us that, despite our modern angst and the seeming chaosof our world, there is order in nature, and there is nothing truly new under thesun. Evolution’s repetitive, fractal patterns allow us to predict that humanswill figure out how to expand their consciousness in order to climb another rungof the evolutionary ladder. The exciting, esoteric world of fractal geometryprovides a mathematical model that suggests that the “arbitrariness,planlessness, randomness, and accident” that Mayr wrote about is an outmodedconcept. In fact, I believe it is an idea that does not serve humanity andshould, as rapidly as possible, go the way of the pre-Copernican Earth-centereduniverse.Once we realize that there are repeating, ordered patterns in nature andevolution, the lives of cells, which inspired this book and the changes in mylife, become even more instructive. For billions of years, cellular livingsystems have been carrying out an effective peace plan that enables them toenhance their survival as well as the survival of the other organisms in thebiosphere. Imagine a population of trillions of individuals living under oneroof in a state of perpetual happiness. Such a community exists—it is called thehealthy human body. Clearly cellular communities work better than humancommunities—there are no left-out, “homeless” cells in our bodies. Unless ofcourse, our cellular communities are in profound disharmony causing some cellsto withdraw from cooperating with the community. Cancers essentially representhomeless, jobless cells that are living off the other cells in the community.If humans were to model the lifestyle displayed by healthy communities of cells,our societies and our planet would be more peaceful and vital. Creating such apeaceful community is a challenge because every person perceives the worlddifferently. So essentially, there are six billion human versions of reality onthis planet, each perceiving its own truth. As the population grows, they arebumping up against each other.Cells faced a similar challenge in early evolution as described in Chapter 1,but the point bears repeating. Shortly after the Earth was formed, single-celledorganisms rapidly evolved. Thousands of variations of unicellular bacteria,algae, yeast, and protozoa, each with varying levels of awareness, appeared overthe next three-and-a-half billion years. It is probable that, like us, thosesingle-celled organisms began to multiply seemingly out of control and toover-populate their environment. They began to bump up against each other andwonder, Will there be enough for me? It must have been scary for them, too. Withthat new, enforced closeness and the consequent change in their environment,they searched for an effective response to their pressures. Those pressures ledto a new and glorious era in evolution, in which single cells joined together inaltruistic multicellular communities. The end result was humans, at or near thetop of the evolutionary ladder.Similarly, I believe that the stresses of the increasing human population willbe responsible for pushing us up another rung on the evolutionary ladder. Wewill, I believe, come together in a global community. The members of thatenlightened community will recognize that we are made in the image of ourenvironment, i.e., that we are divine, and that we have to operate, not in asurvival of the fittest manner, but in a way that supports everyone andeverything on this planet.Survival of the Most LovingYou may agree that Rumi’s words on the power of love are noble ones, but you maynot believe that they fit these troubled times, when survival of the fittest mayseem more appropriate. Isn’t Darwin right that violence is at the core of life?Isn’t violence the way of the natural world? What about all those documentariesthat show animals stalking animals, animals snaring animals, animals killinganimals? Don’t humans possess an inborn inclination to violence? The logic goes:animals are violent, humans are animals, and therefore humans are violent.No! Humans are not “stuck” with an innate, viciously competitive nature any morethan we are stuck with genes that make us sick or make us violent. Chimps, whoare the closest to humans genetically, offer evidence that violence is not anecessary part of our biology. One species of chimps, the bonobos, createpeaceful communities with co-dominant males and females in charge. Unlike otherchimps, the community of bonobos operates not with a violence-driven ethic butan ethic that can be described as “make love, not war.” When the chimps in thissociety become agitated, they don’t engage in bloody fights; they diffuse theirdivisive energy by having sex.Recent research by Stanford University biologists Robert M. Sapolsky and Lisa J.Share has found that even wild baboons, among the most aggressive animals onthis planet, are not genetically mandated to be violent. (Sapolsky and Share2004) In one well-studied baboon troop, the aggressive males died out fromcontaminated meat they foraged from a tourist garbage pit. In the wake of theirdeaths the social structure of the troop was reinvented. Research suggests thatfemales helped steer the remaining, less aggressive males into more cooperativebehaviors, which led to a uniquely peaceful community. In an editorial in PublicLibrary of Science Biology where the Stanford research was published, chimpresearcher, Frans B. M. de Waal of Emory University, wrote: “even the fiercestprimates do not forever need to stay this way.” (de Waal 2004)In addition, no matter how many National Geographic specials you’ve watched,there is no dog-eat-dog imperative for humans. We are at the top of thepredator/prey food chain. Our survival is dependent on eating organisms lower inthe hierarchy, but we are not subject to being eaten by organisms higher in thechain. Without natural predators, humans are spared from becoming “prey” andfrom all the violence that the term implies.That does not mean that humans are outside the laws of nature, of course, foreventually, we too shall be eaten. We are mortal, and following our demise, onewould hope after a long and violence-free life, our corporeal remains will beconsumed and recycled back to the environment. Like a snake turning on itself,humans at the top of the food chain will eventually be devoured by organismsthat are the lowest in the chain, the bacteria.But before that snake turns, we may not live a violence-free life. Despite ourlofty position on the food chain, we are our own worst enemy. More than anyother animal, we turn on ourselves. Lower-level animals sometimes turn onthemselves, but most aggressive encounters among members of the same species arelimited to threatening postures, sounds, and scents, not death. And in socialpopulations other than humans, the primary cause of intraspecies violence iseither the acquisition of air, water, and food required for survival or theselection of mates for propagation.In contrast, the violence among humans that is directly linked to securingsustenance or in the process of mate selection is quite minimal. Human violenceis more often associated with the acquisition of material possessions beyondwhat is necessary for sustenance or the distribution and purchase of drugs toescape the nightmare world we have created or child and spousal abuse passeddown generation after generation. Perhaps the most widespread and insidious formof human violence is ideological control. Throughout history, religiousmovements and governments have repeatedly prodded their constituents intoaggression and violence to deal with dissenters and nonbelievers.Most human violence is neither necessary nor is it an inherent, genetic,“animal” survival skill. We have the ability, and I believe an evolutionarymandate, to stop violence. The best way to stop it is to realize, as Iemphasized in the last chapter of this book, that we are spiritual beings whoneed love as much as we need food. But we won’t get to the next evolutionarystep by just thinking about it just as we can’t change our children’s and ourlives simply by reading books. Join communities of like-minded people who areworking toward advancing human civilization by realizing that Survival of theMost Loving is the only ethic that will ensure not only a healthy personal lifebut also a healthy planet.Remember those under-prepared, under-appreciated Caribbean students who bandedtogether, like the cells they studied in their histology course, to form acommunity of successful students? Use them as role models, and you will helpensure a Hollywood ending not just for individuals mired in self-sabotagingbeliefs but also for this planet. Use the intelligence of cells to propelhumanity one more rung up the evolutionary ladder where the most loving do morethan just survive, they thrive."},{"pageContent":"Addendum [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3341]The science revealed in this book defines how beliefs control behavior and geneactivity and, consequently, the unfolding of our lives. The chapter on ConsciousParenting describes how most of us unavoidably acquired limiting orself-sabotaging beliefs that were downloaded into our subconscious minds when wewere children.As I mentioned in that chapter, there are a variety of “energy” psychologytechniques, which exploit the latest mind-body research to quickly access andreprogram those subconscious programs. Before I leave you, I’d like to talk alittle about one of these energy psychology techniques called PSYCH-K because Ihave personal experience with it, and I am confident of its integrity,simplicity, and effectiveness.I met Rob Williams, the originator of PSYCH-K, at a conference in 1990, where wewere both presenters. As usual, at the conclusion of my presentation, I told myaudience that if they changed their beliefs they could change their lives. Itwas a familiar conclusion with a familiar response from the participants: “Well,Bruce, that’s great, but how do we do that?”In those days I didn’t fully realize the crucial role the subconscious mindplays in the change process. Instead, I relied mostly on trying to power throughnegative behavior using positive thinking and willpower. I knew, though, that Ihad had only limited success in making personal changes in my own life. I alsoknew that when I offered this solution, the energy in the room dropped like alead balloon. It seems my sophisticated audiences had, like me, already triedwillpower and positive thinking with limited success!As fate would have it, I returned to my seat, and looked up to see that the nextpresenter was psychotherapist Rob Williams. Rob’s opening remarks quickly hadthe entire audience on the edge of our seats. In his introduction, Rob statedthat PSYCH-K can change long-standing, limiting beliefs in a matter of minutes.Rob then asked the audience if there was anyone who would like to address anissue that had been troubling them. One woman caught both Rob’s and myattention. She raised her hand tentatively, first up, then down, then up again.Her timidity was palpable. When Rob asked what her issue was, her face turnedred and her response was inaudible. Rob actually had to leave the podium andconfer with her, one-on-one. It was Rob who had to inform the audience that herproblem was “speaking in public.” Rob returned to the stage and the womanhesitantly followed. Rob asked her to tell the audience of nearly a hundredpeople a bit about her fear. Again she could hardly speak.Rob worked with the woman for about 10 minutes, using one of the PSYCH-K changetechniques. Then he again asked the woman to tell the audience how she feltabout speaking to them. The change was astonishing. Not only was she visiblymore relaxed, she began talking to the audience in an excited, yet confidentvoice. The eyes of the conference attendees became like saucers and their mouthsdropped as this woman took over the stage for the next five minutes. The womangot so carried away that Rob had to ask her to stop speaking and take her seatso he could finish his presentation!Because this woman was a regular attendee at an annual conference, and I was afrequent presenter, I was able to witness her amazing transformation over thenext several years. She not only had gotten over her fear of public speaking,but even went on to organize Toast Masters in her community. Eventually, shebecame an award-winning public speaker! This woman’s life was truly transformedin just a few minutes. In the fifteen years since I witnessed that woman’s quicktransformation, I have seen other people rapidly improve their self-esteem andchange their relationships, their finances, and their health using PSYCH-K.The PSYCH-K process is simple, direct, and verifiable. It utilizes the mind/bodyinterface of muscle testing (kinesiology) that I first discovered in astudent-chiropractor’s makeshift office in the Caribbean, to access theself-limiting “files” of the subconscious mind. It also makes use of leftbrain/right brain integration techniques to effect swift and long-lastingchanges. In addition, PSYCH-K integrates Spirit into the change process, just asI have integrated Spirit into my understanding of Science. Using muscle testing,PSYCH-K accesses what Rob calls the “superconscious” mind to make sure that theperson’s stated goals are safe and appropriate. These built-in safeguards allowthis system of personal change to be taught to anyone who is interested intaking charge of their lives by moving out of fear and into love.I use PSYCH-K in my own life. PSYCH-K has helped me undo my self-limitingbeliefs, including one about not being able to finish my book. The fact that youare holding this book is one indication of the power of PSYCH-K! I also lectureregularly with Rob. Instead of offering positive thinking and willpower at theend of my lectures, I instead happily turn audiences over to Rob. While thisbook is about the New Biology, I believe that PSYCH-K represents an importantstep toward the New Psychology for the 21st century and beyond.

During this time of great personal transformation, I was blessed andguided by both spiritual and incarnate muses—the inspiring spirits of the arts.I am particularly indebted to the following muses who have helped make this booka reality.The Muses of Science: I am indebted to the spirits of science, for I am fullyaware that forces outside of myself have guided me in bringing this message tothe world. Special blessings to my heroes, Jean-Baptiste de Monet de Lamarck andAlbert Einstein, for their world-changing spiritual and scientificcontributions.The Muses of Literature: The intention to write a book on the New Biology wasspawned in 1985, though it was not until Patricia A. King came into my life in2003 that this book could come into reality. Patricia is a Bay Area freelancewriter and former Newsweek reporter who worked for a decade as the magazine’sSan Francisco Bureau Chief. I will never forget our first meeting wherein Ioverwhelmed her with a lengthy New Science tutorial and then burdened her with atruckload of aborted manuscripts, sheaves of innumerable articles I had written,boxes overflowing with videotaped lectures, and stacks of scientific reprints.Only as she was driving away did I realize the monumental nature of the task Iwas asking of her. Without formal training in cell biology and physics, Patriciaaccomplished miracles in downloading and understanding the New Science. In avery short time, she not only learned the New Biology, she was even able toexpand on its topics. Her amazing skills at integrating, editing, andsynthesizing information are responsible for the clarity of this book.Patricia works on book projects and newspaper and magazine stories that focus onhealth issues, especially mind-body medicine and the role stress plays indisease. Her work has appeared in publications such as the Los Angeles Times,Southwest Airline’s Spirit magazine, and Common Ground magazine. A native ofBoston, King lives in Marin with her husband, Harold, and their daughter, Anna.I am in deep appreciation and gratitude to Patricia for her efforts and lookforward to the opportunity of writing another book with her in the future.The Muses of the Arts: In 1980 I left academia and went “on the road” presentinga touring light show called The Laser Symphony. The heart and brains of ourspectacular laser production was Robert Mueller, a visionary artist and computergraphics genius. Wise beyond his teenage years, Bob drank in the New Science Iwas working on, first as a student and later as my “spiritual son.” Years ago heoffered, and I accepted, his bid to create a cover for the book whenever itwould appear.Bob Mueller is cofounder and creative director of LightSpeed Design, Bellevue,Washington. He and his company have produced award winning 3-D light and soundshows for science museums and planetariums around the world. Their edutainmentshow on the fragile ecology of our oceans was an honored presentation, seen by16,000 viewers daily at the World’s Expo held in Lisbon, Portugal (1998). Bob’screative endeavors can be sampled at www.lightspeeddesign.com[http://www.lightspeeddesign.com].Bob’s work, inspired by science and the Light, is beautiful and profound. I amhonored to have his contribution as the cover art—the image that will introducethis new awareness to the public.Muses of Music: From the conception of this New Science to the submission of thebook, I have been continuously encouraged and energized by the music of Yes andespecially the lyrics of their vocalist Jon Anderson. Their music and messagereveal an inner knowing and understanding of the new science. The music of Yesspeaks to the fact that we are all connected to the Light. Their songs emphasizehow our experiences, our beliefs, and our dreams shape our lives and influencethose of our children. What takes me pages of text to explain, Yes can say in afew powerful and poignant lines. You guys are great!Regarding the physical production of this book, I sincerely want to thank theNew York publishers who turned down the book proposal. Without you, I was ableto create my own book—just like I wanted to do. I am indebted to Mountain ofLove Productions, Inc. for investing time and resources into publishing thisbook. Toward that end, special appreciation goes out to Dawson Church ofAuthor’s Publishing Cooperative. Dawson enabled us to have the best of bothworlds, the personal management afforded by self-publishing and the marketingexperience of a major publishing house. Thanks to Geralyn Gendreau for hersupport of this work and bringing it to the attention of Dawson Church. Dearfriend and public relations specialist, Shelly Keller, has given generously ofher time in providing professional editing skills.Thanks to all of the students and attendees of my classes, lectures, andseminars who over the years persistently inquired, “Where’s the book???” Okay,okay, here it is! Your continued encouragement is deeply appreciated.I would like to honor some very important teachers who have provided guidance inmy scientific career. First and foremost, my father, Eli, who instilled in me asense of purpose and, just as important, encouraged me to “think outside of thebox.” Thanks, Dad.David Banglesdorf, the elementary school science teacher who introduced me tothe world of cells and ignited my passion for science. The brilliant Irwin R.Konigsberg, Ph.D., who took me under his wing and mentored my doctoraleducation. I shall forever remember our eureka moments and the passion forscience we shared.I am indebted to Professor Theodore Hollis, Ph.D. (Penn State University); andKlaus Bensch, M.D., Chairman of Pathology (Stanford University), the first“real” scientists who understood my heretical ideas. Each of these distinguishedresearchers encouraged and supported my efforts by providing me with space intheir laboratories to investigate the ideas presented in this book.In 1995 Gerard Clum, D.C., President, Life College of Chiropractic West, invitedme to teach Fractal Biology, my very own course on the New Science. I amgrateful for Gerry’s support, for he introduced me to the life-enhancing worldsof chiropractic and complementary medicine.At the first public presentation of this material in 1985 I met Lee Pulos,Ph.D., Assistant Professor Emeritus, Department of Psychology at the Universityof British Columbia. Over the years, Lee has been a great supporter of andcontributor to the New Biology presented in this book. My partner and esteemedcolleague Rob Williams, M.A., developer of PSYCH-K, contributed to this projectby helping bridge the science of cells with the mechanics of human psychology.Discussions of science and its role in civilization with Curt Rexroth, D.C., adear friend and wizard of philosophy, have brought great awareness and joy to mylife. Collaboration with Theodore Hall, Ph.D. offered wonderful and profoundinsights correlating the histories of cellular evolution and human civilization.I sincerely want to thank Gregg Braden for his wonderful scientific insights,his suggestions regarding publishing, and for providing the intriguing subtitleof this book.Each of the following, dear and trusted friends read and critiqued this work.Their contributions were vital in bringing this book to you. I personally wantto thank each of them: Terry Bugno, M.D., David Chamberlain, Ph.D., BarbaraFindeisen, M.F.T., Shelly Keller, Mary Kovacs, Alan Mande, Nancy Marie, MichaelMendizza, Ted Morrison, Robert and Susan Mueller, Lee Pulos, Ph.D., CurtRexroth, D.C., Christine Rogers, Will Smith, Diana Sutter, Thomas Verney, M.D.,Rob and Lanita Williams, and Donna Wonder.I am grateful for the love and support offered by my sister, Marsha, andbrother, David. I am particularly proud of David for what he jokingly refers toas “breaking the circle of violence” and becoming a great dad to his son, Alex.Much appreciation goes out to Doug Parks of Spirit 2000, Inc., for hisoutstanding support of this project. Upon hearing the New Biology, Doug fullydedicated his efforts to getting this message out to the world. Doug hasproduced video lectures and workshops that have broadened public awareness ofthis material and have opened the doors to many seeking self-empowerment. Thankyou, dear brother.These acknowledgments would not be complete without a most special thank you toMargaret Horton. Margaret has been the driving force behind the scenes and hasempowered the writing and materialization of this book. What ever I write andsay, my darling … it was done in love for you!"},{"pageContent":"Endnotes [chap7_biologyb_9781401923440_epub_part7.html#d3401]IntroductionLipton, B. H.

He has been a guest speaker on dozens of TV and radio showsas well as keynote presenter for national conferences.Dr. Lipton began his scientific career as a cell biologist. He received hisPh.D. from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville before joining theDepartment of Anatomy at the University of Wisconsin’s School of Medicine in1973. Dr. Lipton’s research on muscular dystrophy, studies employing clonedhuman stem cells, focused upon the molecular mechanisms controlling cellbehavior. An experimental tissue transplantation technique developed by Dr.Lipton and colleague Dr. Ed Schultz and published in the journal Science wassubsequently employed as a novel form of human genetic engineering.In 1982, Dr. Lipton began examining the principles of quantum physics and howthey might be integrated into his understanding of the cell’s informationprocessing systems. He produced breakthrough studies on the cell membrane, whichrevealed that this outer layer of the cell was an organic homologue of acomputer chip, the cell’s equivalent of a brain. His research at StanfordUniversity’s School of Medicine, between 1987 and 1992, revealed that theenvironment, operating though the membrane, controlled the behavior andphysiology of the cell, turning genes on and off. His discoveries, which rancounter to the established scientific view that life is controlled by the genes,presaged one of today’s most important fields of study, the science ofepigenetics. Two major scientific publications derived from these studiesdefined the molecular pathways connecting the mind and body. Many subsequentpapers by other researchers have since validated his concepts and ideas.Dr. Lipton’s novel scientific approach transformed his personal life as well.His deepened understanding of cell biology highlighted the mechanisms by whichthe mind controls bodily functions, and implied the existence of an immortalspirit. He applied this science to his personal biology, and discovered that hisphysical well-being improved, and the quality and character of his daily lifewas greatly enhanced.Dr. Lipton has taken his award-winning medical school lectures to the public andis currently a sought after keynote speaker and workshop presenter. He lecturesto conventional and complementary medical professionals and lay audiences aboutleading-edge science and how it dovetails with mind-body medicine and spiritualprinciples. He has been heartened by anecdotal reports from hundreds of formeraudience members who have improved their spiritual, physical, and mentalwell-being by applying the principles he discusses in his lectures. He isregarded as one of the leading voices of the New Biology."},{"pageContent":"NOTES-257639335 [images/9781401923112_0235_002.jpg]-257639334 [images/9781401923112_0235_003.jpg]"}]
