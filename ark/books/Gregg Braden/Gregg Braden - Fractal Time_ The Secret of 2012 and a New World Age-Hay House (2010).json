Modern science seems to agree. In the language of physics, time mergeswith the space it travels through to create space-time, ripples in the quantumocean that makes the universe possible.A growing body of evidence suggests that time's waves, and the history withinthem, repeat as cycles within cycles. As each new cycle begins, it carries thesame conditions as the past, but with a greater intensity. It's this fractaltime that becomes the events of the universe and life.Using a code that we're only beginning to understand, the ancient Maya chartedfractal time on a series of calendars unlike anything the world has seen since.Because they understood the cycles, they knew that the conditions of the futureare also etched into the record of the past. This includes the mysterious enddate of the present world-age cycle: December 21, 2012. The key to understanding2012 and what it means for us today is to know how to read the map of time.This book is dedicated to our discovery of time as the language of our past, themap to our future, and the world to come.[images/00067.jpg][images/00017.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS[images/00016.jpg]Introduction .........................................1Chapter 1: The Time Code Program: Finding Our Future in the Cycles of thePast.... 19Chapter 2: Our Journey Through Time: The Doctrine of World Ages................. 35Chapter 3: The End of Time: Our Date with 2012 ......... 57Chapter 4: The Key to the Universe: Time and Nature's Most BeautifulNumbers..... 75Chapter 5: History Repeats in Love and War: Fractal Warnings for the Future[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_003.html#filepos246230] ............. 113Chapter 6: The End of Time Revisited: What Can We Expect?[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_003.html#filepos316068].................... 147Chapter 7: Choice Point 2012: Armageddon or the Second Eden?[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos376871] ........... 177Appendix A: The Time Code Calculator ................... 205[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos436135]Appendix B: Global Flash Points for the Future[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos464265] ............. 219Appendix C: Reference Dates for 2012 Conditions[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos498196] .......... 236Acknowledgments .....................................239[Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos503479]Endnotes [Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos509014]........................................... 243About the Author [Fractal_Time__The_Secret_of_201_split_004.html#filepos539620]..................................... 253[images/00019.jpg]\"For I dipped into the future, far as human eye could see, Saw the Vision of theworld, and all the wonder that would be.\"- Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892), poetWe're living the end of time.Not the end of the world, but the end of a world age-a 5,125year cycle oftime-and the way we've known the world throughout that time. The present worldage began in 3114 B.c. and will end in A.D. 2012. Because the end of anythingalso marks the beginning of what comes next, we're also living the start of whatfollows the end of time: the next world age, which ancient traditions called thegreat cycle.From the epic poems of India's Mahabharata to the oral traditions of indigenousAmericans and the biblical story of Revelation, those who have come before usknew that the end of time was coming. They knew, because it always does. Every5,125 years, the earth and our solar system reach a place in their journeythrough the heavens that marks the end of precisely such a cycle. With that end,a new world age begins. Apparently it's always been this way.For at least four such cycles (or five, according to the Mesoamerican traditionsof the Aztec and the Maya peoples), our ancestors endured the changes in globalmagnetic fields and climate, diminishing resources, and rising sea levels thatcome with the end of time. They did so without satellites and the Internet orcomputer models to help them prepare for such a radical shift.The fact that they lived to tell the story stands as a powerful testament to anundeniable truth: it tells us beyond any reasonable doubt that the inhabitantsof our planet have survived the end of world ages in the past. Beyond simplysurviving, our ancestors learned from the difficulties that can accompany thechange. In the words of their day, they did their best to tell us what it meansto live such a rare moment in history. It's a good thing they did, because suchevents are few and far between. Only five generations in the last 26,000 yearshave experienced the shift of world ages. We will be the sixth.The present world age isn't something that will simply fade away into the sunsetof a time that seems to perpetually linger somewhere \"out there\" in our future.Just the opposite: our world age has an expiration date. It ends at a specifictime, with a specific event, on a day that was marked on a calendar more than2,000 years ago. There is no secret about that date. The Maya who calculated italso inscribed it as a permanent record for future generations. The date isetched into stone monuments that were built to last until the end of time.Using the format of the ancient Long Count calendar-the system of timekeepingthat the Maya developed to track extremely long periods-the last day of thepresent world age is written as a five-part code. Read from left to right, theparts have unique names that represent decreasing units of time. The leftmost isthe baktun and represents 144,000 days. Moving right, the katun corresponds to7,200 days; the tun, 360 days; the uinal, 20 days; and the kin, 1 day.' Withthis code in mind, the Mayan calendar places the end date of our age at13.0.0.0.0 (13 baktun cycles, and 0 cycles for the rest of the units).When the date is translated to our familiar system of time, the message becomesclear. It tells us that our present world cycle will conclude with the wintersolstice that takes place on December 21 in the year 2012. It's on this datethat the mysterious Maya identified the astonishing astronomical events thatwill mark the end of our age ... and they did so more than two millennia ago.Time Code 1: We're living the completion of a 5,125-year-long cycle of time-aworld age-that the ancient Maya calculated would end with the winter solstice onDecember 21, 2012.To put into perspective just how rare the ending of such a cycle really is,consider that the last humans to witness the shift from one world age to thenext lived in the year 3114 B.C., approximately 1,800 years before the time ofMoses and the biblical Exodus.New Meaning to the End of TimeIt's only recently that the meaning of a world age has made sense to modernscientists. Although the countdown to the end of time is etched deeply into ourunconscious psyche (almost universally, people throughout the world share theirsense of a feeling that something is \"up\"), the conditions that it brings areonly now being recognized by scientific disciplines, ranging from geology andoceanography to astronomy and climatology.The reason scientists seem to be so late in jumping on the bandwagon of 2012 isbecause of technology, or the lack of it. Only in the last 60 years or so havewe had the computers, satellites, and remote-sensing equipment capable ofverifying the connection between the end of a world age and the changes itbrings to our lives. The global climate, patterns of war and peace, and even ourspiritual relationship with God and the universe all appear to be directlyinfluenced by the planetary changes that are being documented now by the bestscience of today.Just as we are cautioning future generations about our 20thcentury experience ofnuclear weapons and global warming, the civilizations of our past cautioned usabout their experience of the end of time. Having just lived the end of the lastgreat cycle in their day, Earth's inhabitants did what humans do following anepic event that forever changes the world: they recorded the events for futuregenerations. In doing so, they ensured that we would know what to expect, aswell as how to prepare. And our ancestors did it from direct experience.More than 51 centuries ago, our ancestors did their best to inform and warn usof what that they knew would be an era of powerful transition in a future thatthey could only imagine in their dreams. That era is now. To understand theirmessage is to understand our journey through the heavens and time. It's allabout cycles.Time Code 2: Our ancestors recorded their experience of the last \"end of time,\"showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the close of one world age is thebeginning of the next, and not the end of the world.The very nature of a cycle is that it repeats itself. So every time the end ofone appears, by definition it's also the beginning of the next. The key here isthat to get to the beginning of what's new, the cycle must pass through the endof what exists. While this repeating nature of cycles is obvious on the smallscale of things, like seasons of the year and phases of the moon, it's notalways so obvious when we're talking about cosmic cycles of solar systems movingthrough the galaxy.This is where the message of our Mayan ancestors comes in. They recognized thenature of time's cycles long before science described our journey through theheavens. Their timekeepers preserved what they knew and incorporated theirknowledge into stories about the universe and life: nonscientific descriptionsof creation and destruction, birth and death, beginnings andendings-descriptions that remain today. While the specifics regarding theend-time vary across traditions, cultures, and religious beliefs, there is acommon theme that seems to run through all of them. Almost universally, ancientpredictions for our time in history describe an age filled with an epic\"darkness.\"From the Hindu chronicling of the yugas to the Mayan Long Count marking theremaining days of the current great cycle, the close of our age has beenanticipated as an era of war, suffering, excess, and inequality. While thesedescriptions sound ominous, there is a bright side: although the darknessappears to be necessary, it also appears to be briefThe reason: Physically, our solar system is moving through the shortest part ofan orbit that looks like a flattened circle, an ellipsis whose far end carriesus to the most distant point from the core of our home galaxy, the Milky Way.The physical effect: Both ancient traditions and modern science tell us that ourlocation in this cyclic orbit determines how we experience the powerful sourcesof energy, such as the \"massive magnetic fields,\" which radiate from ourgalaxy's core.2 Recent studies suggest that it is precisely such cycles that mayexplain the mysterious patterns of biodiversity-the rise and fall of life onEarth, such as the mass extinctions that happened 250 million and 450 millionyears ago.' Additionally, modern discoveries confirm that Earth's position(orbit, tilt, and wobble) throughout the journey creates the ever-changingcycles that influence everything from temperature and climate to polar ice andthe planet's magnetic fields.4 Details of these effects will be discussedthroughout the book.The emotional/spiritual effect: As we travel farther from our galaxy's core, ourdistance from the energy located there was described by ancient traditions asthe loss of a connection that we sense both spiritually and emotionally.Scientific links between the quality of Earth's magnetic fields, how they'reaffected by cosmic conditions, and our feeling of well-being seem to preciselysupport such ancient beliefs.-'In the same way that Earth's rotation makes the darkest part of the night appearjust before the dawn, our position in the heavens is such that the darkest partof our world age appears right before our heavenly orbit begins the return thatbrings us closer to our galaxy's core. With that return, we experience relieffrom the cataclysmic forces of the cycle's darkness. And just as the night mustpass in order to get to the new day, the only way to arrive at the light of thenext cycle is to finish the darkness of this one.We all know that dark experiences definitely exist in our world, and we don'tneed to look far to find them; however, there's also more to life than thesuffering that the ancients foresaw-much more. Even in our time of greatdarkness, the polarities of peace, healing, love, and compassion are alive,well, and abundant.Our ancestors had an amazingly deep grasp of just what our experience of cosmiccycles means on multiple levels. Somehow they knew that Earth's position in theheavens would affect the physical conditions in our world, as well as theemotional and spiritual experiences that we need to embrace them. Through myth,analogy, and metaphor, they reminded us that the farther we travel away from thesource of such powerful energy, the deeper we are in darkness and the more outof sync we find ourselves with the fields that influence life here on Earth.From the traditions of the Hopi to the ancient Vedas, it's this experience ofseparateness that is credited with our sense of being lost as well.Our ancestors cautioned that at the most distant point in our cycle, we wouldforget who we are-our connectedness to one another and the earth. They told usthat we would forget our past. It's precisely this disconnected feeling thatseems to be the consequence of the cyclic journey that carries us to the far endof our galactic orbit. It's also the fear that is spawned by such feelings thathas led to the chaos, war, and destruction at the end of cycles past.At the conclusion of the last two world ages, for example, the Hopi describe thegreed and wars that led to the loss of the very things that we cherish the most:our families, our civilization, and ourselves. Archaeological discoveries of anadvanced civilization located in the Indus River valley between what is nowIndia and Pakistan seem to support the Hopi myths, as well as those of the100,000-line epic of the Hindu Mahabharata.6The site has revealed the bodies of humans that appear to be in what thearchaeologists called \"postures of flight,\" suggesting that they were fleeingfrom whatever it was that destroyed their civilization. Students of theMahabharata suggest that the work describes a great war fought in the valleymarking the precise location of the new discoveries. The remains are dated atapproximately 10,000 years old, placing them into the time frame of two worldages past.When we understand what the darkness of our cycle means and why it's necessary,we begin to see the great challenges of our time in a new light. With thatlight, our moment in history and our response to the changes that come with ittake on new meaning. With these ideas in mind, it becomes even clearer that nowis the best time for us to go through such a cycle.The reason is that now is the first time we have the understanding, the need,and the technology to reach into the realm of all possibilities and choose thekind of future that will arise from the chaos of the present. This is somethingthat would have been impossible even 50 years ago.If we look closely at the stories and records that have been handed down to usfor more than 250 generations, it becomes obvious that those who experienced theend of the last world age worked hard to make sure we know precisely what itmeans to do so. We find the fruits of their labor preserved for us today intheir temples, texts, traditions, and cultures.The Alignment We've All Been Waiting ForAlthough the creation stories from ancient civilizations, such as the Hopi,Hindu, and Mayan cultures, differ in specifics, they generally agree when itcomes to the cyclic nature of the universe. They state that at least threeworlds have existed, and been destroyed, before the one we're living today.While different traditions use different signs to tell us where we are in ourworld-age cycle, it seems that all the signs are essentially telling us the samething: the shift from our present age into the next is now.What sets the calendar of the Maya apart from the oral traditions, such as theHopi, is that their timeline for the shift ends on a specific date. While theirsystem of calendars accurately identifies the alignment that marks the shift (arare astronomical configuration that modern computers have now confirmed), it'swhat the Maya knew about Earth's journey through the heavens that makes theirstory even more astounding.Specifically, they knew that during a zone of time before and after the 2012winter solstice, Earth and our entire solar system would move into a positionthat is extraordinary by any standards. It's during this time that we pass animaginary line that defines the two halves of our disk-shaped galaxy. In justthe way the equator of the earth divides the Northern and Southern hemispheres,the equator-like line that we cross in the Milky Way separates the \"top\" of thegalaxy's disk from the \"bottom.\" As the planets of our solar system line up withone another and our sun, our crossing of the galaxy's equator also aligns uswith the mysterious source of energy that lies at the heart of the Milky Way.This alignment and the conditions that it creates signal the completion of thegreat cycle, as indicated by the Mayan calendar.'To be absolutely clear, this is not an event that happens suddenly in a singleday. In other words, our crossing of the imaginary line that divides our galaxydoes not suggest that we'll all go to bed on December 20, 2012, in one world andwake up the next morning to a radically different world on the 21st. Rather, thewinter solstice appears to be the astronomical marker that the Maya chose todesignate the center of the transition zone. That zone begins well before andends well after 2012.Because of the size and relative distances of heavenly bodies, to us here onEarth this alignment appears as a slow, gradual shift over a period of time. Ourfamiliar experience of an eclipse is a perfect illustration of how such agradual shift occurs.If you've ever watched a lunar eclipse, it probably didn't take long for you todiscover that it wasn't going to be over quickly. Once it began, you could duckinto the house, fix a cup of tea, make a couple of phone calls, and feed thepets before going back outdoors to observe the eclipse's progress. Even thoughthe earth is hurtling through space at about 65,000 miles per hour, on the nightof a lunar eclipse, such an enormous speed isn't obvious. That's the effect ofhuge objects like planets moving through space at tremendous speeds across vastdistances. To us, they look like they're in slow motion.So in the case of the sun moving into an alignment with the equator of the MilkyWay, the winter solstice of 2012 marks a point within the zone of a shift thatactually began years ago. In his landmark work identifying the 2012 crossover ofthe galaxy's equator and its significance, Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, John MajorJenkins describes how such a transition is a process rather than an event. Usingcalculations made by Belgian astronomer jean Meeus, Jenkins suggests that theprogression of the sun across the zone of the Milky Way's equator covers acorresponding zone of time that began in 1980 and ends in 2016.8 Even with amargin of error of plus or minus a few years, this means that we're already wellinto the alignment that the Maya predicted more than 2,000 years ago.[images/00018.jpg]What does such a rare moment in astronomical history mean in our lives today?The truth is that no one knows for sure. We can't, because no one living todayhas a direct experience of the last time something like this happened. What wedo have, however, are good indicators of what we can expect. We have facts.When we marry the facts of today's science with the wisdom and the historicalrecords of the past, we find a story that's almost beyond belief. It's the storyof a journey-our journey-that began so long ago that it has taken more than 256generations and five millennia to reach the end. Now that it's doing so, wediscover that the end is actually the start of a new journey. Perhaps poet andvisionary T. S. Eliot best described the irony of an end being a beginning: \"Weshall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be toarrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.\"9While the story of a shifting world age based in our planet's orbit through thecosmos may sound like the plot of a Star Trek episode, the celestialcalculations that our ancestors left us are surprisingly consistent with thescientific findings of today. When we put it all together, they tell the samestory. With that story, we suddenly have a new meaning for the greatestmysteries of our past, as well as the clues that tell us what to expect in ourfuture.Fortunately, our ancestors left us everything we need to meet the challenges ofa great world age. It's not only about cycles. It's about our ability torecognize patterns and where we are within the cycles.The Code of TimeIn the 1980s, I worked in the defense industry writing software to look forpatterns in data. It was during this time that the world experienced one of themost frightening and secretive eras in history: the Cold War. With more than70,000 nuclear-tipped weapons poised to strike the largest cities in Europe andNorth America at a moment's notice, I found myself searching for a way to makesense of war within the context of a bigger picture.Was the Cold War part of a cycle? Could the seemingly random events leading tothe wars of the past actually be part of a great, evolving pattern that beganlong ago? And if such a thing is possible, then do the patterns extend beyondthe experience of war into the things that happen in our daily lives, like loveand betrayal?If we were to find that every aspect of our world is part of an ancient andongoing cycle, such a discovery would give us a powerful new way to think ofourselves. It would imply that everything from the beginnings and endings ofjobs and relationships to the exact years when war is waged and peace isdeclared is all part of a cycle-a pattern that makes it possible to reveal theconditions for the future that we've already experienced in the past. If such apattern actually exists, then we could even take its meaning one step further.It would allow us to pinpoint an experience, any experiencefrom romance tohurt-and find that it's part of a pattern that can be known and, more important,be predicted. Such a vantage point would go a long way toward helping us makesense of our world. It would also be of immense value as we embark upon ourjourney into the 21st century and find ourselves in the uncharted territory ofmerging the knowledge and ideas of East and West, and ancient wisdom and modernscience, to solve the great challenges that threaten our survival.Well, you've probably guessed that the answer to each of my questions regardingcycles is the same. It's yes! The reason for the answer could fill volumes andis the subject of this book. The key to such a powerful view of time and historyis that we can only understand how cycles relate to life by crossing the fuzzyline that has traditionally separated science from the spiritual traditions ofour ancestors.For example, when we marry the ancient understanding of time's cycles with NoblePrize-winning physicist Albert Einstein's 20th-century discovery of the unity oftime and space, something wonderful begins to happen. Three facts emerge withimplications that change everything we've been led to believe about our lives inthe world:[images/00277.jpg][images/00365.jpg][images/00282.jpg]These facts carry two powerful implications that lay the foundation for the restof this book and are summarized below.Time Code 3: New discoveries show that we can think of time as an essence thatfollows the same rhythms and cycles that govern everything from particles togalaxies.Time Code 4: We can think of the things that happen in time as places withincycles-points that can be measured, calculated, and predicted.With Time Codes 3 and 4 in mind, we have the reasons and the tools to think oftime in a powerful new way. Rather than considering the minutes of each day asnature's way of keeping everything from happening at once, as pioneeringphysicist John Wheeler once remarked, now we can envision time as a kind of codethat connects the past with the future. Just as any other code can be crackedand understood, the message of the ancient Mayan calendar may be deciphered andread like the pages of a book.For some people, this perspective of time and life is a very different way ofthinking about things. For others, while it is certainly unconventional, it alsomakes perfect sense. The idea is fascinating. The implications are deep,mysterious, and exhilarating. While they challenge much of the way we've beentaught to think of the universe, we also find ourselves powerfully drawn to sucha possibility. We want to know more. We find ourselves wanting to apply this newunderstanding of time to the real world to make sense of everything from thetragedies of life to the mysteries of the future. And we can.Although quantum scientists tell us that we can never predict an exact future,what we can predict are probabilities for the future. This is precisely what theexistence of repeating cycles of time demonstrates. Each time a cycle appears,it repeats the general conditions that make something possible, rather than aprecise outcome. Just as the conditions in Earth's atmosphere can create theperfect environment for a tornado without ever actually forming one, time'scycles can bring together all of the circumstances that led to an event inhistory, without that event occurring again in the present.The key here is that the ingredients for repetition are present and thesituation is \"primed.\" The way those conditions play out, however, is determinedby the choices we make in life. Knowing in advance where our choices can havethe greatest impact tips the scales in our favor as we complete the cycle thatholds our wellbeing and, ultimately, our survival in the balance.Time Code 5: If we know where we are in a cycle, then we know what to expectwhen it repeats.If we can really think of time in the universe in the same way that we think ofthe stuff that happens in life-as the events that fill it-then the cycles withintime can be measured in the same way we measure the stuff that happens. Just aswe are able to predict the cyclic return of a comet streaking through theuniverse, suddenly we can also pinpoint the year when the conditions that led tothe rise of a civilization or an act of war will come around again. The beautyof such an understanding is that along with the moments in our time that areripe for chaos, we can also identify the moments in our future that are ripe forpeace.Because all such cycles are based on natural rhythms, we can use the universalcodes that govern everything from the movement of quantum particles to the shapeof our galaxy in a formula that takes the guesswork out of finding the places intime we're searching for. That is precisely what we'll do in the chapters thatfollow.Once we develop the ideas of time's cycles, we can use our understanding in oneof two ways: (1) we can follow the instructions in this book to make our ownTime Code Calculator that tells us how to find the times in our future when wecan expect a repeat of conditions past, or (2) we can use the automatedWeb-based version that does the same thing for us.Either way, we'll be able to plug in a specific year, such as the end of theMayan cycle in 2012, to find the time(s) in the past that tell us what to expectwhen the cycle returns. In doing so, we give ourselves an unprecedented viewinto time, and something concrete to anchor our expectations for the end of thepresent great age.But the Time Code Calculator is not limited only to major events on a globalscale. It works for the things that happen in everyday life as well. It appearsthat the conditions leading to the pivotal moments we experience-from the joysand crises in our personal lives to the wars and peace between nations-repeatthemselves as cycles, large and small, and follow the same natural rhythms. Touse the cycles in our lives, we must recognize the patterns: when they begin,how they play out, and how to read their timing.Time Code 6: The Time Code Calculator shows us when we can expect the conditionsof the past to repeat, not the events themselves.This is precisely why the Time Code Calculator is so valuable. Along with therepeating cycles that make the conditions possible, each cycle also containschoice points, moments when change seems to come easier and be most effective.So while the themes of global war, personal betrayal, and peace themselves maybe set into the timeline, the outcome for each of these specific themes is not.As is the case with all of human experience, it's what we do with the conditionpresented to us that dictates the next phase of our lives.In Chapter 1, for example, we'll see how the conditions for a surprise attack onAmerican soil have been present three times throughout the 20th and 21stcenturies. Based on repeating cycles of time, the Time Code Calculator clearlyidentifies the two dates when the conditions for such an attack would be presentfollowing the seed event in 1941. But while we were attacked on one of those twodates, on the second we were not. Although the conditions were present, humanchoices (which will be described in Chapter 7) prevented the third attack.The key to using our choice points is that for us to affect our future in aconscious way, we must recognize where we are in the cycle. This all begins withour realizing that we're actually living a Time Code of sorts, a pulsating fieldof energy that has a beginning, is ever-expanding, and carries what scientistshave called the \"forward march of time.\"[images/00022.jpg]With these ideas in mind, questions arise: What is possible? Does the pastreally hold a blueprint for the future? What could something that happened athousand years ago possibly tell us about today? What about the mysterious enddate of the Mayan cycles? Is there a way to look backward in time to give us anidea of what may be in store for us come 2012? These are the questions that ledto the research for this book. The chapters that follow are their answer.Why This Book?There is certainly no shortage of books and media coverage regarding the Mayancalendar and the year 2012. It seems like every month new volumes show up on thebookshelves and in Internet bookstores. As with any topic that strikes apowerful chord within people's hearts and minds, the new books offer verydifferent, often conflicting perspectives. Ranging from scholarly predictionsthat have taken years to research to stream-of-consciousness dictations claimedto be from off-planet intelligence, all serve a purpose. All add to thecollective momentum that appears to be building as we approach the wintersolstice of December 21, 2012. The revolutionary insights of philosopher andethnobotanist Terence McKenna in his books True Hallucinations (1993) and TheInvisible Landscape (1975), and the scholarly work of researchers such as JohnMajor Jenkins, have already explored the mystery and meaning of the 2012 enddate ... and have done so beautifully.It's precisely because such powerful works already exist that I had to be clearabout my contribution to the 2012 literature. What could I possibly say that hasnot already been said? Perhaps the best way to answer this question is to stateexplicitly what this book is, what it's not, and what it offers.In the pages that follow, you will ...> ... discover how the conditions for the Mayan end date of A.D. 2012 have> already happened in our past as a fractal of what we can expect in our future.> ... see how nature's \"most beautiful numbers\" guide us to the places in the> past that describe what is to come.> . . . identify the \"hot dates\" that hold the greatest threats of war and the> greatest opportunities for peace in our immediate future.> ... calculate your own Time Code for the key events and relationships in your> life.> ... discover the personal and collective choice points of life and> history-moments in time when change seems to come easier than it does at> others.Through the seven concise chapters in this book, I invite you into a powerfuland practical way of thinking about your relationship to time, history, and thefuture. It's important to know up front what you can expect from any new path ofself-discovery. For that reason, the following describes precisely what thisbook is-and what it is not:> - This book is not a science publication. Although I will share the> leading-edge science that invites us to rethink our relationship to time, this> work has not been written to conform to the format or standards of a classroom> science text or technical journal.> - This book is not a peer-reviewed research paper.

If youhave always sought to answer the questions Does history repeat itself? and Howis the future connected with the past? then you will appreciate this book.The key to 2012 and our time in history is understanding the language ofnature's cycles and using that language today to prepare for the future.Ultimately we may discover that our ability to understand and apply the \"rules\"of Fractal Time holds the key to our deepest healing, our greatest joy, and oursurvival as a species.Fractal Time is written with one purpose in mind: to read the map of the pastand apply what we learn as we approach 2012 and the world beyond. In doing so,we give meaning to the past while unlocking the code of life's possibilities inthe future-both opportunities that generations to come will have to wait another26,000 years to see again.- Gregg BradenTaos, New Mexico, 2009[images/00024.jpg][images/00025.jpg]\"I believe the future is only the past again, entered through another gate.\"- Sir Arthur Wing Pinero (1855-1934), dramatist\"Time is an indivisible whole, a great pool in which all events are eternallyembodied ..- Frank Waters (1902-1995), author and biographerWe live in a universe of cycles.From the tiny pulses of energy generated by an atom to the rise and fall ofenormous magnetic fields within the sun ... from the constant rhythm of theocean's tides to the thousands of miles traveled by a tiny hummingbird as itmigrates to warmer climates every year, our world is a never-ending dance ofnature's repeating cycles. They're part of everything.Intuitively we know about cycles through direct experience. A woman's menstrualrhythm, for example, is governed by a 28-day cycle that is also linked to thecyclic phases of the moon. Each day our bodies follow the rhythms of a 24-hourperiod (the circadian cycle of light and dark)-which regulate such things aswhen we sleep, when we're alert, and when we're hungry. And while the use of60-watt lightbulbs and the consumption of late-night cappuccinos may haveforever changed the way we respond to nature's rhythms, the fact is that thecycles are still there.When we look a little closer at nature's cycles, we find that each is part of alarger one that unfolds within an even larger one and so on-nested cycles oftime and energy that govern the rhythms of the universe and life. The familiarexperience of day and night is a perfect illustration of how these nested cycleswork. The hours of light and dark that we see daily are due to the way Earthrotates with respect to the sun, a cycle that takes about 24 hours. How long thelight and the dark of each day last, in turn, is linked to the way Earth tiltstoward or away from the sun while it's orbiting: the cycles that create theseasons of the year. How much our planet tilts is part of an even greater cyclethat determines how long the seasons last over thousands of years.While the experience of day, night, and the seasons offers a clear example ofnature's cycles, there's much more to them than the length of a day or whensummer begins. In the words of poetry, Ralph Waldo Emerson described ourrelationship to nature's cycles simply and beautifully: \"Our life is anapprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn; thatthere is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning.\"Both Emerson's words and our understanding of cycles lead us to the questionsthat must be asked: If nature's cycles are everywhere, could it be thateverything from our romantic and business relationships to our globalrelationships, everything from the light of a new birth to the darkness ofSeptember 11, 2001, is part of the great cycles that we are just learning torecognize? If so, can we prepare for the future by recognizing the past?If such a relationship really exists, it changes everything we've been led tobelieve about our world and ourselves. We may well discover, for instance, thatthings as varied as the frequency of our accomplishments and failures, thesuccess of our relationships and careers, and even the length of our lives stemfrom cycles that we're just beginning to understand. With our new understanding,we may also find that we're no longer the victims of a mysterious fate that weattributed so much of our experience to in the past. To explore such arelationship, however, we must begin by recognizing the patterns that surroundus.The Firefly CodeWith my feet dangling just inches above the water, I sat motionless on a lognear the stream behind my family's house. In the summer of 1965, I rememberbreathing the hot, thick Missouri air as the last light of the day faded.Everything changes at night in the woods of America's Midwest. Although I couldstill see the twilight sky above, the dense growth of moss and vines hangingfrom the ancient forest blocked the sunset on the ground. I stared into thedarkness and waited. Experience had taught me that patience and silence were thekeys to studying anything in nature. Over the years I'd gotten very good atboth.At first I saw only one out of the corner of my eye. Then there was another, andanother. Suddenly they were all around. It was as if someone had just flipped aswitch that said Now! and the fireflies of summer were everywhere. Watching themperform their mystical dance of movement and light and then seeing themdisappear as suddenly as they appeared was an after-dinner ritual that I lookedforward to every year. But for me it was more than simply watching lights flashand vanish. It was about something hidden, something secret and mysterious. Itwas the rhythm and the cycles. It was the patterns.As a child, I looked for patterns everywhere. Sometimes they were silly ones,like how many times the lights on our Christmas tree would blink off and onbefore they went dark and began the next cycle, or how many cars of the samecolor there were in one row of a grocery-store parking lot. At other times thepatterns seemed to call out for someone to find them, like the number of times afirefly would flash its eerie glow before it rested and began again. Surroundedby hundreds of them, I remember thinking that there must be more to the lightshow than just the random flashes on a summer night.Maybe the lights were actually a code of some kind, carrying a message fromnature itself. Because insects can't speak, perhaps the lights were the way inwhich they were communicating, with long and short bursts of light representingthe dots and dashes of a language-like nature's Morse code. If I could justcount the flashes, and the time between each pause, maybe I could \"read\" thecode.A Universe of PatternsWell, I never found the \"firefly code,\" at least not in the way I had originallyimagined. While the summer light shows did turn out to be coded signals ofnature, they were part of something even more primal and mysterious than I hadsuspected. In a high school biology class, I learned that the flashes of lightI'd seen on those hot Missouri nights were actually part of a mating ritual ofsignals-a sex code-from male fireflies looking for their perfect female fireflymates. Sitting on that log, I had placed myself right in the middle of animmense dating ceremony that was driven by the ancient and deeply rooted urge toreproduce.Although the reality of the firefly code may not have materialized, the ideathat time itself could be part of nature's code did. On my seventh birthday, mymother supported my fascination with ancient history and gave me a gift that Iwould cherish well into my adult life. It was a book by C. W. Ceram describing\"lost\" civilizations that had been rediscovered in modern times; and featuredGreek, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and South American archaeology. Called Gods,Graves & Scholars, it had a profound influence on my way of thinking of the pastthat continues to this day.'I was especially awed by the fact that powerful civilizations with advancedknowledge, such as the ancient Maya, could have existed so long ago, only todisappear and be lost for centuries. As I studied the glossy photographs showingthe tops of their temples rising above the dense Mexican jungles, I wonderedwhat it was that the Maya knew that we'd forgotten, especially when it came totheir concept of time. With discoveries that range from new revelations aboutthe Mayan calendar to the profound mathematics of fractal patterns, we can nowbegin to answer that question today.[images/00026.jpg]As an adult, I recognized that the patterns I'd studied as a child are more thanjust random oddities. Our world is made of those patterns. Not just chance oneshere and there, but patterns within patterns that form order and structure. Manyof nature's patterns can be measured and predicted easily-the crescent-shapeddunes of sand that continually drift through the Great Sand Dunes National Parkand Preserve high in the mountains of southern Colorado, for instance, or thebranching patterns that we see in the veins on an oak leaf or as the water froma garden hose runs downhill. At other times the patterns of nature are not soeasy to see, like the invisible winds that move an entire mass of air across acontinent, or the psychological forces that drive the world's stock markets.Whether we see them or not, the patterns of nature are everywhere. If I reallywanted to understand how things work, it was clear that I needed to understandthe patterns they're made of. During the last years of the Cold War, I foundmyself working as a senior computer-systems designer in the defense industrydoing precisely that. Perhaps not surprisingly, one of my first assignments wasin a specialized area of computer programming known as pattern recognition.One day while I was searching for patterns in nature to use as a model forsoftware to track data, I came across the work of a scientist/ philosopher fromthe early 20th century, R. N. Elliott. Before his death in 1948, Elliott hadwritten a powerful synthesis of how natural laws seem to govern many aspects ofeveryday life, including nature's cycles. It was that book, modestly titled TheMajor Works of R. N. Elliott, which forever changed the way I thought about theuniverse, civilization, and, most important, time.2What I found so fascinating about Elliott's work was that he had not onlyrecognized patterns and cycles in nature; he also described ways to apply whathe had discovered in the real world. A cornerstone in Elliott's research was onevery special number that is found throughout our bodies, our lives, and ourworld, in ways that I had never been told about when I was in school: the goldenratio. In words that were clear and direct, Elliott showed how it applied toeverything from the number of males and females in a natural population to theeconomies of nations.It was during the same time that a specialist in stock-market forecasting,Robert R. Prechter, Jr., discovered Elliott's work as well. Recognizing thatglobal economics and the stock market are indicators of the investor community'soptimism or pessimism-part of a natural cycle-Prechter took Elliott's ideas onestep further and created the most successful market-prediction tool in thehistory of the New York Stock Exchange. Called the Elliott Wave Principle, it isstill used today.The key to the success of the Elliott Wave Principle is found in two basicassumptions:> 1. The market will always advance and decline in precise intervals-the \"waves\"> of the Elliott Wave theory.> 2. If you know where the advance begins, you can calculate when and how often> the declines will occur.My thinking was that if life and nature follow the patterns of such a code, thenit made perfect sense that time itself should do so as well-a time code ofsorts. Just like the intervals of the stock market, if we could recognizenature's Time Code, then the cycles it creates could be measured and calculated.In other words, if we know when a cycle begins and the pattern that it follows,then we also know where and how it will end. Perhaps most important, if we knowthe conditions that a cycle brings, then we also know what to expect each timeit reappears. It took many years and many attempts to find a way to apply whatI'd learned about cycles to the events of our world. Once I did, there was noturning back.The reason is because nature's Time Code works. What it reveals is both soberingand astounding. To step back and recognize the patterns we've lived in the past,and are living right now, is perhaps one of the most empowering things we can doas individuals and as a civilization. It's as if our willingness to recognizethe interconnectedness of nature's patterns is the gateway to the opportunity ofconscious participation in the very cycles that the patterns reveal. In my wayof thinking, that's nothing less than the miracle of a second chance.Perhaps the best way to illustrate how the cycles of time repeat in predictableways is through an example. What could offer a better one than to find that thedefining event for the early 21st century-9/11-is actually part of a largercycle that began 60 years before the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed?Could We Have Known?The sound of the phone jolted me from the bizarre sleep that often follows the13-plus hours of a flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne, Australia. As I sat upin bed, a stream of nonstop questions flooded my mind: Where am I? What time isit? Who could possibly be calling me in Australia before the sun has even comeup? In the faint glow of a streetlight shining through a crack in the windowshades, I found the phone on the nightstand beside me. Pressing the button thatwas flashing \"Line 1,\" I didn't have to wait long for the answer to my lastquestion.Immediately the frantic yet familiar voice of a friend on the other end of theline launched into a barrage of information that made little sense to me. Therewas no \"Good morning\" or \"How are you?\" or any of the typical greetings thatcome from friends and family half a world away. The first thing I heard was,\"Turn on your television! Now! Something is happening ... I don't know ... OhGod!\"Reaching for the TV's remote, I flipped through the channels on the screensuspended from a bracket in the corner of the room. Although the stationsweren't familiar, the skyline of the city that they were featuring was. Eachchannel was showing the same horrible images that looked like something from thefinale of a Hollywood thriller. Due to the time difference, while it was dark inAustralia, the images I was seeing showed the smoke-filled sky above New YorkCity on the morning of September 11, 2001.Along with the rest of the world, I was both shocked and mesmerized by what Iwas seeing. I felt disoriented and uncertain, mystified by the images that werenow flowing nonstop on every station. Quickly I dressed and bolted for the hotellobby. I was not prepared for what I saw. When the elevator doors opened, therewere people everywhere, all jammed together, vying for a view of the hugetelevision mounted above the lobby's reception area. Some were red-eyed andcrying openly, some were moaning, some were simply standing in the stoic silencethat comes from seeing something that makes no sense to us, yet that we know isreal.As I made my way through the crowd onto the street, I could see masses of peoplein motion everywhere. Although it was early, cafes had opened and appliancestores had turned on every television in their showroom windows so the people onthe streets could look on, as America experienced one of the most horrifyingdays in its history, which was also a turning point for the world.I walked briskly along the street past cafe after cafe. Everywhere it was thesame: confusion, uncertainty, fear, and the nonstop images on the televisions. Ifound myself asking two questions over and over.The first was simply Why? Why would anyone do something so bizarre, so brutal,so heartless?The second question was not as simple. It took me back to my childhoodinclination to see a world full of patterns. While my mind tried to make senseof what was happening, I suddenly found myself reeling from my own question:Could we have known? I heard myself whisper under my breath, \"If life and worldevents really follow patterns and cycles, is today part of a pattern? Is there away we could have prepared for this day or even prevented it?\"To be absolutely clear, I was not asking if we could have known precisely whatwould happen on that date or how it could have changed the world so much and sofast. And I was not suggesting that we could have predicted that someone woulduse jet planes as lethal weapons to level huge skyscrapers and take the lives ofmore than 2,000 people. That's not what my questions were about.At that moment, for me it was about patterns, my need to make sense of somethingso senseless and to find a place for it to fit in a world of cycles.Fractal History/Fractal TimeThe crowds that filled Melbourne's busy cafes spilled out of the buildings andonto the sidewalks throughout the morning of September 11, 2001. For as far as Icould see, there were people everywhere doing their best to go about life asusual. But the morning was anything but usual. As office workers and studentswere going through the motions of the day, it was clear that they were stunnedand uncertain. Two times within one city block I'd seen drivers turn intooncoming traffic as if there was no one else on the road, only to be jolted fromtheir driving trance by the sound of the screeching brakes and the horn from thecar that was bearing down on them.In the midst of the confusion, I cautiously crossed from light signal to lightsignal, making my way back to the hotel. My mind darted between staying aware ofthe chaos swirling around me and the events I'd witnessed earlier in the day. Asingle question kept repeating in my mind: Could the horror of the World TradeCenter and the Pentagon attacks be part of something greater? Beyond terrorists,politics, and conspiracies, was there a bigger pattern unfolding in front of oureyes, a pattern that could only be seen when we stepped back and looked at thebig picture from a different perspective?It wouldn't be until 2008 that I would have my answer. In the clarity of thatanswer, a pattern would emerge that was so obvious that my question changed fromCould we have known? to How could we have missed it?My thinking was that there must be a very good reason why ancient mystics, suchas the Vedic and Mayan timekeepers, dedicated so much energy and resources tostudying time. Because their perspective on history's cycles was so differentfrom our views today, and since both have been found to be so accurate, the twoways of thinking must be part of a greater wisdom. So it would make tremendoussense to combine the wisdom of our past with the best science of today to giveus a powerful new way of thinking about life and ourselves.Merging everything I'd learned while searching for patterns as a computerprogrammer with what I knew of the ancient Egyptian, Hindu, and Mayan views ofcycles, the golden ratio, and nature's fractals, I found a model of time-a TimeCode program-that offers a powerful window into the events of our past as wellas our future. The key is that time repeats in cyclic patterns and that eachrepetition is similar to the last (fractal), with a greater intensity.The Time Code program can be used in three different ways to reveal the cyclesof specific events. These are:> • Mode 1, which tells us when we can expect the conditions for something that> has happened in the past to occur again> • Mode 2, which tells us which date in the past holds the conditions we can> expect for the future> • Mode 3, which tells us when we can expect the conditions of a personal> experience, either positive or negative, to repeat in our livesFor the events of September 11, 2001, I used Mode 1. For ease of reading, I haveplaced the description and specifics of this process in Appendix A. To find theconditions that may have led to a pivotal date in the past, such as September11, 2001, or those we can expect for a date in the future, such as December 21,2012, I needed two pieces of information:> 1. The date of the event in question> > • This can be a time in the future when we want to know what conditions to> > expect.> > • This can be a time in the past when the seed of an obvious pattern began,> > examined for the purpose of discovering when it will repeat in the future.> 2. The total length of the present cycle we're exploring: the 5,125-year-long> world-age cycle or the larger cycles that define even greater agesTo explore September 11, I used the Time Code program to find the seed that mayhave led to the events that changed the world. The first piece of informationrequired some research. To discover what pattern September 11 might be a partof, I needed a date that may have started the cycle before the World TradeCenter attack. To have the certainty of a date that could not be questioned, Ineeded to find one with the same characteristics-the same patterns-that playedout on September 11.Although the controversy and unanswered questions remain in the minds of manypeople to this day, the one thing that is generally agreed upon regardingSeptember 11, 2001, is that the United States of America was attacked on thatday. Regardless of how or why it happened, there is a consensus that America andAmericans were the target of what can only be described as a vicious attack.For most people, there wasn't even a hint that something of such magnitude couldpossibly happen. So it's fair to say that the events of September 11, 2001, tookthe nation and the world by surprise. As such, the words describing the theme ofthe seed date I was searching for was one of America being surprised andattacked.With the knowledge that past conditions repeat themselves in cycles, a search ofhistory revealed a date that unquestionably matched the criteria. In this case,it even matched the precise words of surprise and attack used to describe theevents of 9/11. The date was December 7, 1941: one that President Franklin D.Roosevelt forever marked in the psyche of the world as the \"date which will livein infamy.\" On that day America's naval base in Pearl Harbor was attacked bysurprise, and 2,117 American lives were lost. It was also the day that theUnited States of America officially entered World War II. After this date wassettled on, the year 1941 became the first input point for the Time Codeprogram.The second piece of information-the length of the cycle within which everythingis happening-was easy, because all of recorded human history has happened inessentially the same cycle. Perhaps it's no coincidence that this is the greatcycle of 5,125 years described by the Mayan calendar. Although this may soundlike an arbitrary choice, there are two facts that make the Mayan calendarunique among the timekeeping systems of the world. While we will explore thesefacts later in the book, briefly they are:> - First, the calendar is the single most accurate system of tracking nature's> cycles of galaxies, planets, and our relationship to the sun known until the> 20th century.> - Second, the cycle that we're now in is approximately onefifth of the bigger> cycle (the fifth and last world of the Mesoamerican traditions) that describes> the precession of the equinoxesour 25,625-year journey through the 12> constellations of the zodiac, commonly rounded to 26,000 years.The input into the Time Code program was ready. The seed date was 1941. Thecycle length was 5,125 years. With all of the information at my fingertips, Ibegan the calculations. Immediately, two dates emerged. Each indicated a timewhen America could reasonably expect the same themes of \"surprise\" and \"attack\"it experienced on that historic day of infamy.The Time Code WorksThe first date that the program identified was 1984. When I saw it, the yearsurprised me and didn't make much sense-that is, until I discovered alittle-known and frightening fact that was revealed to the world only after theend of the Cold War.History shows that 1984 marked a time of some of the greatest tension betweenthe United States and the former Soviet Union. The threat of a nuclear exchangewas so great during that year that the hand of the famous Doomsday Clock(maintained since 1947 at the University of Chicago by the board of directors ofthe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to keep the world informed of the threatof global catastrophe) was moved to five minutes before the worst possible timeof midnight.3 The move represented only the second time since the clock was putinto place that the world had been so close to atomic war. It was not until theend of the Cold War, however, that we really knew just how close. In the early1990s, Russian authorities declassified the records describing an event thatbrought us even closer to that war than we had known.[images/00028.jpg]In September 1983, the Soviet military mistakenly shot down Korean Air LinesFlight 007, a civilian jumbo jet that had strayed into Russian airspace. All ofthe Boeing 747's 269 passengers and crew were killed, including U.S. CongressmanLawrence McDonald. During that time, the tension between the superpowers was sohigh that the Russians feared America would view the mistake as an act of war.Recently declassified records show that the Soviet Union, assuming that it wasonly a matter of time before the United States acted in retaliation, hadactually planned a preemptive attacka nuclear attack-to preserve theirfirst-strike advantage.`For reasons that could fill a book, history will show that, fortunately, theattack did not occur. The key here is that the conditions for a surprise attackagainst America did exist and were in place in 1984, just as the Time Codeprogram predicted they would be.The next date that arose was a time when America wasn't so lucky. The programcalculated that the next time we could expect the conditions leading to\"surprise\" and \"attack\" would come precisely when it did, in the year 2001(Figure 1).[images/00320.jpg]Figure 1. Example of how fractal patterns play out as events in time. Thesurprise attack upon the United States in 1941 planted the \"seed\" for a cyclethat continues today. The Time Code program uses the principles of fractalpatterns and natural cycles to tell us when we can expect the conditions of the1941 surprise and attack to repeat (see Appendix A).While the relationship between these dates certainly deserves additional study,there are three facts that we cannot discount:> 1. Based upon a documented seed date, when the conditions of \"surprise\" and> \"attack\" were set into motion, the Time Code formula successfully identified> the next two times when America could expect those conditions to repeat> themselves.> 2. On both of the predicted dates, a plan to surprise and attack America> actually existed.> 3. On one date, the plan was actually carried out.The data are clear. While this example is for a single, graphic, and horribleevent that is now part of our history, it is just that: an example to illustratehow events within a cycle can be related. The Time Code Calculator works forother occurrences as well. From the joys and crises in our personal lives to thewars and peace between nations, it appears that the conditions leading to thepivotal moments of life repeat themselves as cycles. Now we must ask ourselvesthe following:> • What do such patterns mean for today?> • What can they tell us about our future?> • Can nature's Time Code shed any light on the frightening predictions for the> mysterious Mayan date of 2012?> • Can the program give us a solid basis for the beliefs of many New Age gurus,> numerous self-help prophets, and every major religious and spiritual tradition> of the last 5,000 years?In the chapters that follow, we will answer each of these questions in detailand learn to think of time and the things that happen in the world from apowerful new perspective. With our new understandings firmly in hand, we'llapply what we know to everything from our personal lives to our global future.For such a perspective to make sense, however, we've got to think about ourworld from the vantage point of those who dedicated their lives to understandingvast cycles of time-the timekeepers of the past. What better way to begin thanby exploring their view of time and the great world ages of long ago?[images/00023.jpg][images/00027.jpg]\"The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to theidea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number ofdeaths and rebirths.\"- Carl Sagan (1934-1996), pioneering astronomer\"Our distant ancestors understood the true astronomical meaning behind thedoctrine of World Ages.\"- John Major Jenkins, contemporary expert on Mesoamerican cosmologyThere is little doubt in the minds of the world's indigenous elders thatpresent-day events are the fulfillment of their ancestors' prophecies for theend of time. Although many of the details for such prophecies have been shroudedin secrecy to preserve their integrity, those who have held them sacred are nowopenly sharing them with the world. Sensing that now is \"the time,\" they believethat people of all nations and beliefs can benefit from the wisdom of the past.While the specifics of how we may recognize the significance of the early 21stcentury vary from tradition to tradition and from telling to telling, commonthemes weave the different prophecies into a consistent story. Those of the Hopiof America's Desert Southwest offer a beautiful example.The Four Worlds of the PastIn words that are simple and direct, the Hopi recount a story that many peopletoday prefer to think of as a metaphor for the past rather than a factualhistory. Maybe it is easier to think of the following prophecy in that way. Ifthe story is true, it tells of a past that is just too frightening and toopainful for many to accept.It's the story of Earth, and human history on it, punctuated with times when theunthinkable has happened: the planet changed so quickly and drastically thatlife as it was known before the change forever disappeared. In his landmark bookMeditations with the Hopi (1986), scholar Robert Boissiere illustrates theclarity and simplicity of the Hopi worldview. Following are brief excerpts froma longer narrative he gathered while living among the Hopi for years, havingbeen accepted as family.> On the destruction of the first world:> The remnants of the first people moved in with the ant people to be safe when> Sotuknang [the sky God] destroyed Tokpela, the first world, with fire.'> On the destruction of the second world:> [Then] some became greedy!-though life was plentiful. Greed made them fight> one another.... So Taiowa [the Creator] said to Sotuknang, \"Destroy this> second world!\" ... The [second] world froze solid from pole to pole, and in> its imbalance, the world stopped spinning for a while.2> On the destruction of the third world:> In this [third] world, humankind grew and grew, spreading everywhere.... Some> became so powerful, they waged war on the others, annihilating them with their> machines.... Then Sotuknang destroyed the third world. A great flood covered> the Earth; it rained for a full moon.3These excerpts describe three vast cycles of time, three previous worlds thatexisted before the fourth one of today. Each of the preceding worlds concludedwith a great cataclysm: the first with earthquakes and the sinking ofcontinents, the second with the earth covered in ice, and the third with a greatflood. The prophecy says that the fourth world will end in our lifetime and thatwe will soon be living in the fifth.Although the words are nonscientific, the Hopi description of the events thatended each era is eerily similar to the history of the earth that is preservedin the geological record. Recent data from ocean sediment and polar ice coresconfirm that the planet has, in fact, undergone a cyclic history of cataclysmfrom fire, ice, and water, as well as recovery periods. There was a period ofearthquakes and volcanic activity around 20,000 years ago. The ice age peakedabout 11,000 years ago, and there was a deluge that is believed to have been thebiblical Flood, which occurred approximately 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.According to the Hopi, the same cycles of time and nature that have heraldedsuch changes in the past are now bringing the present world to an end as thenext begins. What makes the Hopi worldview so important going forward is itsaccuracy regarding the past. The key here is that the Hopi knew of these cycleslong before modern researchers could confirm them scientifically. If suchindigenous knowledge of cycles is so accurate for the past, then what does thatmean for their predictions of what's to come in the future?Our Journey Through the ZodiacFrom the oral traditions of the Hopi to the 5,000-year-old records of theancient Sumerians, among others, a growing body of evidence suggests that humanshave long understood our journey through the heavens. In their understanding,they also recognized that the familiar stars and constellations of the night skyseemed to change their positions in space during that journey.Just the way the sun shining on the Northern Hemisphere appears lower in the skyduring the winter than in the summer, the constellations appear to rise and setat different times and locations depending upon where we are in our journey.This change, known as the precession of the equinoxes, has been recognized bymany civilizations, from ancient India to Egypt. The bottom line to theprecession is that the scenery of the night sky changes as we trace our paththrough the heavens over time.Historically, our journey across the universe has been described as a circularpath that carries us through the 12 familiar zodiac signs. Because there are 12constellations that we pass through, each is assigned one piece of the circle(12 constellations x 30 degrees each = 360 degrees of the orbit).Historical records show that our speed through the heavens has varied throughouthistory. Modern satellites reveal that it takes Earth about 72 years to passthrough 1 degree of our zodiac orbit. This means that at the present time ittakes us about 2,160 years to pass completely through one zodiac sign. Thismakes perfect sense, as the present Age of Pisces is believed to have begunabout 2,000 years ago, and we are nearing its end as we transition into the newAge of Aquarius.Based on Earth's current speed through the cosmos, this also means that ourentire journey through all 12 constellations takes about 25,625 years. For easeof use, this number is commonly rounded to 26,000 years. This is our voyagethrough the zodiac, our \"precession\" through the equinoxes. Our knowledge ofthis journey gives even greater meaning to the doctrine of World Ages, as wellas to our passage through the cosmos.[images/00030.jpg]Figure 2. Ancient civilizations, such as the Greeks and Egyptians, used thechanging constellations of the night sky to mark the progress of our 25,625-yearjourney through the zodiac. Left: Within that period of time, Earth passesthrough five world ages lasting 5,125 years each. Right: When we divide thelength of the full zodiac cycle (25,625 years) by the length of the presentworld age (5,125 years), the number is exactly S. In other words, there are fiveworld ages in a full cycle of our journey through the zodiac signs.Time Code 7: Ancient traditions divide Earth's 25,625year orbit through the 12constellations of the zodiac-the precession of the equinoxes-into five worldages lasting 5,125 years each.The Meaning of the AgesBecause the speed of our journey through the constellations has varied in thepast, there are different ideas of precisely when one zodiac age ends and thenext begins. This is important because the name that we give to our time inhistory-our zodiac age-is determined by which constellation provides thebackdrop for the rising sun on the day of the spring (vernal) equinox each year.At the present time, for example, we're in the Age of Pisces.The Piscean Age is believed to have begun 2,160 years ago, just before the timeof Jesus. As of 2008, we are transitioning from the Age of Pisces toward the Ageof Aquarius. But don't expect the transition to be a fast one. As mentionedpreviously, the change is a process rather than an event. The problem is thatthere are no clear boundaries between the zodiac signs telling us an exact timewhen one ends and the next begins. Instead, there is an overlap as we phase outof one and into the next. So it would be fair to say that although we aretechnically in the Age of Pisces, we have entered into the zone of the AquarianAge as well.I find this particularly interesting, as each zodiac sign has been associatedwith traits that are unique to its time in history. It's probably not acoincidence that before the present Piscean Age, the ram's head that signifiedthe constellation Aries played such a powerful role in the ancient world. TheEgyptians of the New Kingdom era (16th century B.C. to 11th century B.c.), forexample, embodied the symbol of Aries in their representation of the god of thesun, the ram-headed Amen Ra. And it's probably not by accident that the earlyChristians chose for their religion the same symbol as that of their zodiac age,the two opposing fish of Pisces.In her beautifully worded interpretation of the significance of the zodiac ages,author and medical intuitive Caroline Myss describes the duality of the Pisceansymbol:> ... the fundamental blueprint of Pisces (two fish swimming in opposite> directions) expressed itself in a continual need to divide and conquer,> separate and study, split East and West, body and soul, male and female, yin> and yang, the left-brained from the right-brained, the intuitive from the> intellectual .. .4These are arguably the characteristics of our world for the last 2,000 years.Because there is no clear boundary between the end of one age and the beginningof the next, today we are experiencing the transition that embodies thequalities of both: the Aquarian Age, and the qualities that it brings, with theattributes of the Piscean Age. Once again, Myss eloquently characterizes thisshift:> ... Aquarian consciousness holds the template of holism (holy)-to draw> humanity together. Thus, holism has become the template for medicine, the> environment for the beginnings of a global community, and for how we now model> ourselves: body/mind/spirit. Holism has become the new soul impulse. We are> now living between eras-half in Pisces, an age of separation-and Aquarius, an> age of unity and holism.'While the precise timing of the zodiac ages varies, from about 9600 B.C. untilthe present, the general descriptions for what happened during the last six ofthem do not. To identify each age, scholars and historians have chosen onedefining event that marks each period of time. Following is a brief summary ofthose characteristics:[images/00346.jpg]Figure 3. The last six zodiacal ages and their defining events. While otherthings certainly happened during the ages, these events are used as touchstonesto give meaning to historical comparisons.There are places in the world where ancient timekeepers used explicit symbols todescribe the cycles of zodiac ages, as well as the longer world ages. Thelasting rock of the temple walls where they engraved their time maps haspreserved their message in a way that cannot be mistaken. With the clarity oftheir records, any doubt as to whether or not our ancestors, or at least some ofthem, understood Earth's movement through the ages quickly disappears.One the clearest, as well as one of the most mysterious, of these artifacts isthe beautiful zodiac disk embedded into the stone ceiling of the Dendera templecomplex on the west bank of the Nile River in Egypt.The Mystery of the Dendera ZodiacThe sun had already descended into the thick evening mist of the Nile Valley bythe time we reached the temple complex. Our day of exploring Egypt's Valley ofthe Kings near Luxor had started before sunrise that morning. What a beautifulplace to end this day, I thought, the 1st-century B.c. Dendera temple dedicatedto the goddess Hathor and to ancient principles of healing.I had met with the Egyptologist John Anthony West in a hotel lobby in Cairo afew days earlier. As we each had our respective groups touring Egypt during thesame time, we agreed to combine them briefly for an evening of dialogue andconversation. It was during that time that West had given me a copy of his newlyreleased book, The Traveler's Key to Ancient Egypt. In Chapter 17, I had foundthe image and description of the place that was one of the primary reasons whyI'd invited my group to take this trip. It was a chamber among the rooftopchapels in the temple where we had just arrived: the Temple of Hathor atDendera.6The eerie afterglow of sunset was settling into the valley, and now every minutecounted. I knew that we had less than a half hour of light remaining before theauthorities closed the site for the day and we would be forced to leave. While aportion of the group followed our Egyptian guide through the halls filled withimmense columns and high-relief hieroglyphs, others followed me to the tall,narrow passages to the roof of the complex. As I turned the corner, I found thesteep stairs that led to the elevated sanctuaries above. This was the place I'dbeen looking for.I knew that just beyond the top of the stairs was the room I'd discussed withWest in Cairo-the one that I'd come halfway around the world to see for myself.Stepping from the stairway into the remaining light illuminating the temple'sroof, I followed the walkway directly into a small room with a ceiling so lowthat we had to stoop as we passed through the entrance. The faint light ofsunset that filtered through the doorway had little effect inside the tinychamber, and I closed my eyes for a few seconds to acclimate to the shadows.\"There it is!\" I heard someone whisper in awe under his breath. \"It's sobeautiful!\" Turning my gaze to the place where the people in the room werepointing, I found that I was directly beneath the ancient relic that made seeingthis temple so worthwhile to me. Directly above my head was aneight-foot-diameter sandstone disk embedded into the stone of the ceiling itselfthe mysterious Dendera zodiac.[images/00029.jpg]Figure 4. Left: Looking up to the zodiac disk on the ceiling of Egypt's Templeof Hathor at Dendera, which is near Luxor, Egypt. Right: A schematic drawing ofthe Dendera zodiac showing the constellations as they appeared during the timethe disk was constructed.In high relief and with perfect detail, this ancient celestial map held all ofthe information needed to calculate Earth's journey from one zodiac sign to thenext across an entire 25,625-year precessional cycle. While controversy remainsas to whether or not ancient civilizations understood this cycle, I had no doubtthat I was staring directly into undeniable evidence that the sculptors of theDendera zodiac did understand-and they understood really well.As I studied the disk above me, I was mesmerized. It was even more beautiful anddetailed than I had imagined. This was more than just a two-dimensional outlineof the familiar signs of the zodiac. From the images in the center of the diskrepresenting the polestars, which change over a span of 15,000 years (Thuban,the polestar during the time of the biblical Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt;Polaris, our current polestar; and Vega, the polestar of the coming world age),to the alignment of the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpio, which show theway to the mysterious center of our galaxy, it was clear that the designers ofthis amazing artifact could track the movement of our planet through the stars.If there was any lingering doubt regarding the zodiac's accuracy, it quicklydisappeared when I recognized the intentional alignment of the temple with thebrightest star in the sky, Sirius. In Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, thiscelestial body is commonly associated with Horus, a form of the Egyptian god oflight. On the Dendera zodiac, we find Horus portrayed in two places: he issimultaneously perched on a papyrus stalk located precisely along the axis ofthe temple itself (see Figure 4, arrow A) as well as on the true north/southaxis touching the sign of Cancer, which is where the sun would have risen andilluminated the sky map of the disk itself during the summer solstice when thetemple was built (see Figure 4, arrow B).'It's precisely because the Dendera zodiac appears to be so accurate that one ofits unsolved mysteries with regard to the way it depicts an aspect of our timein history is significant: the shift between the ages of Pisces and Aquarius. Asyou can see in Figure 4, the familiar 12 zodiac signs are arranged reasonablyclose to one another on the disk. Each one follows the previous sign andprecedes the next so closely that there is no room for other symbols to beinserted between them, except in the case of the world's zodiac sign for thelast 2,000 years, Pisces, and the sign we are transitioning to next, Aquarius.There's an inordinate amount of space between the Piscean fish and the AquarianWater Bearer that's sometimes called the \"anomaly\" or \"discontinuity\" betweenthe two signs. What makes this spacing on the Dendera zodiac disk particularlyinteresting is that the area also contains a peculiar symbol known as the Squareof Pegasus (see Figure 4, arrow C), which appears between the two fish of Piscesand has markings that can't be read on the disk itself. Tradition associatesthis symbol with an actual artifact-a physical tablet-that holds what are calledthe programs of destiny.How might the programs of destiny relate to our experience of the shift betweenthe zodiac signs, as well as to the world ages? How does the curious space thatonly appears between the two zodiac signs matching our time in history relate tothe close of our world age?While the experts continue to speculate on the answers to both questions, we maynot have to wait much longer to understand what the disk is telling us. It'sobviously about here and now. Clearly the Dendera zodiac is a message of time.Specifically, the disk I saw above my head in the rooftop chapel is an ancientmap of our journey through time, a celestial clock that is still ticking awaythe changes in our relationship to the heavens.The Dendera zodiac is the only artifact of its kind known to exist today. Whilethere's controversy surrounding whether the disk originated somewhere else andwas transported to the temple or whether the Egyptians who constructed thetemple also built the disk, one thing is certain: whoever created the zodiacdisk at Dendera understood our journey through the heavens. In thatunderstanding, they also showed us when to expect the great shift from one worldage to the next.[images/00032.jpg]I later learned that the disk installed in the Dendera temple roof today is anexact replica of the original, which was sold to the Louvre museum in Paris. Inan effort to re-create the most delicate details of the original disk, thereplica has even been blackened in the way the original artifact was discovered,the result of centuries of smoke and soot burning on the floor just below it. (Idid have the opportunity to see the original Dendera zodiac disk in Paris ashort time later and was happy to see that the reproduction appeared to be aprecise replica of the one in the Louvre.)The Doctrine of World AgesThe Dendera zodiac tells us that long before modern scientists began lookingseriously at the implications of Earth's location in the heavens, ancientcivilizations had already done so. From the oral traditions of the indigenousNorth and South Americans to the written records of cultures that inhabitedancient India, Tibet, and Central America, we learn that civilizations of ourpast identified key locations along our planet's path through the heavens, aswell as patterns of stars that would tell us when we have reached thoselocations. They did so using more than guesswork or superstition. They usedscience.Specifically, they used their knowledge that Earth's orbit around the sun andits radiant energy is part of a larger orbit that carries us around the energyradiating from the core of our galaxy. Also, they knew that at certain placesalong our journey, Earth's orientation would create changes that would affectthe planet's life and civilizations. While the knowledge of the earth's passageduring such huge periods of time may have originated long ago, it's far from aprimitive idea. In fact, it is based upon a very sophisticated understanding ofplanetary and galactic cycles and how they influence our journey through theheavens.Every 5,125 years, the natural changes in Earth's position in space create anastronomical alignment that signals the end of one cycle around the galaxy andthe beginning of the next. The ancients called the periods of time between suchalignments worlds or world ages. The changes in climate, sea level,civilization, and life that have accompanied the shifts in the past have been sogreat that when they've occurred, the existing world is said to have ended. Forclarity here, it's not the planet itself that ends, but our location in an orbitthat changes.Just as the end of the night is a necessary part of our 24-hour day and makesthe day that follows possible, the end of one age is a necessary part of our5,125-year cycle that gives birth to the next. As John Major Jenkins describesbeautifully in Maya Cosmogenesis, the Maya actually viewed the time within aworld age as a gestation period.'Rather than giving birth to an individual life, like at the end of a humangestation, the Maya foresaw something much grander. They viewed the conditionsof the galaxy as converging in a perfect way to serve as a cosmic midwife. Fromthis perspective, the great birth that 2012 is facilitating is a spiritual one:humankind's evolutionary leap in response to the cyclic changes of Earth'sorbit. The knowledge that such cycles occur, and of what happens when they do,is known today as the doctrine of World Ages.Time Code 8: The position of the earth within our galaxy creates powerfulchanges that signal the end of one world age and the beginning of the next. Theknowledge of these cyclic changes is known as the doctrine of World Ages.The study of the vast cycles of time required for a world age is a science thatwe are only beginning to recognize in the modern world. It's a good thing weare, because the secret preserved by such high knowledge may hold the key toavoiding the suffering that our ancestors experienced during the last time a5,125-yearlong great cycle came to a close.The World Ages AgreeAmong the most ancient and cherished traditions of our past there is aremarkable consistency with respect to the descriptions of previous worlds andhow each one ended. Perhaps the most ominous thread they share is that thecataclysmic event that brought each to a close and began the next was seen as anecessary \"cleansing\" that paved the way for the upcoming cycle.[images/00283.jpg]Figure S. A brief comparison of diverse ancient traditions shows the commontheme of world ages and cycles. While the number of them varies, the way inwhich each ends does not. Each tradition describes an event that \"cleanses\" oneage and prepares the world for the next.It's generally accepted that the first written documentation of world ages isfound in the Vedas, the traditional literature of ancient India. While oraltransmission of the same stories probably existed for thousands of years priorto the literature, the formal texts were not written until about 1500 B.C. Whilethe Vedas were intended for scholars, another set of texts was created foreveryday use by nonscholars. These are the 18 books known as the Puranas, whichtogether contain the essence of the Vedic literature.The Vedas describe huge expanses of time lasting so long that they challenge ourmodern notion of the past. These texts include the familiar Rigveda, as well asthe Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. In them we find some of the earliestdescriptions of how the universe is periodically created, destroyed, and rebornover vast spans of time called yuga cycles, or simply yugas.Interestingly, the actual length of each yuga is determined by theinterpretation of the texts themselves. As is the case with many ancientwritings, interpretations vary. In his scholarly investigation of Vediccosmology Mysteries of the Sacred Universe, mathematician Richard L. Thompsonacknowledges these varying points of view. \"There is some controversy regardingthe history of the yuga system. The traditional view in India is that the yugasare real and have therefore been going on for millions of years. The view ofmodern historians is that the yugas are mere ideas that developed historicallythrough a series of stages.\"9 Regardless, though, scholars seem to be in generalagreement as to the way the yugas work.Vedic cycles of creation and destruction are based in the repeating series offour yugas, each representing a different length of time. Together, they form asteplike progression of increasingly longer periods determined by multiplyingthe shortest yuga by the simple formula of 1:2:3:4. In the traditionalinterpretation, the Kali Yuga is the briefest cycle, lasting for a period of1,200 years, which is multiplied by the first number of the formula, 1, toarrive at its length. The Dvapara Yuga, the next cycle in the series, iscomputed by multiplying the length of Kali by the next number in the formula, 2,to arrive at its own length of 2,400 years.Following the same formula, the Treta Yuga and the Satya (also known as Krita)Yuga last for 3,600 years and 4,800 years, respectively.Human Time or Divine Time?So far, so good. But here's the catch: the texts identify the yugas as beingdivine years.10 This is where the uncertainty comes in. Scholars have differentopinions as to precisely what a divine year means to us here on Earth. Thompsonsummarizes this uncertainty when he asks, \"Could it be that divine and humancycles of 12,000 years are both intended by the yuga system-with onerepresenting events on a cosmic scale and the other mirroring the petty pace ofhuman affairs?\"\"I find this possibility fascinating because of the nature of the universe andtime itself. Scientists tell us that both are made of little cycles withinbigger cycles within bigger cycles and so on. In other words, they are fractal.The very definition of a fractal is a pattern that repeats itself in similarways on different scales.We may well discover that whoever designed the ancient yugas understood suchfractal principles beautifully. If so, then we may use the Vedic system of timeto go beyond simply tracking days, centuries, and millennia. It may be, in fact,that the yugas describe a special relationship between us and time: a fractalinterplay between planets, galaxies, and our lives, which is described by anancient axiom: \"As above, so below.\"While Vedic scholars may not agree on the length of a divine year, they do agreethat the four traditional yugas are equal to one divine yuga. In other words,12,000 divine years equal 4,320,000 years of Earth time. When we consider that asingle day of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, is 1,000 of these cycles(4,320,000,000 Earth years), it may be no coincidence that this number is soclose to the scientific estimates of the earth's age, now placed at about4,500,000,000 years old!In the traditional texts, each of the yugas is multiplied by a sacred numberthat converts it from divine years into the longer human equivalent. Theconversion factor is the single elegant and powerful number that defines one ofthe most mysterious shapes in the universe-the circle. The number that definesit is 360. When we apply this factor of 360 to the yugas described previously,we see where the controversy and the uncertainty come from.Multiplying the traditional 1,200 years of the Kali Yuga by 360 increases thefigure to 432,000 years. When we do the same multiplication, the Dvapara Yugajumps from 2,400 years to 864,000 years. The Treta Yuga goes from 3,600 years to1,296,000 years, and the Satya Yuga from 4,800 years to 1,728,000 years.Suddenly these cycles become such vast periods of time that they stretch oursensibilities and challenge our present ideas of time and human history.As mentioned before, some scholars have suggested that these values are based onan esoteric interpretation of the original texts, one that doesn't apply toactual human years on Earth. It may be for precisely this reason thatalternative interpretations of the original texts are gaining popularity today.While such readings still describe four yuga cycles, they do so with shorterperiods of time. The work of Sri Yukteswar Giri12 and renowned Jyotishastrologer Dr. David Frawley (Vamadeva Shastri),13 illustrate these updatedinterpretations.Frawley describes yuga cycles of approximately 2,400 years long based on hisrendering of the traditional Manu Samhita text.14 Modern scholars are drawn tothis interpretation because it makes more sense with what we now know about theprecession of the equinoxes. Frawley also suggests that the shorter yugas placethe age of important historical Indian figures, like Lord Krishna, into ameaningful context that makes sense with the accepted age of human history.I mention both the traditional and alternative perspectives of the yugas here toshow that even the Vedic experts are divided when it comes to the lengths andthe timing of the cycles. What's important is that while the interpretation ofyuga lengths varies, from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, thenumber of yugas in a given cycle does not. The Vedas, like the Mayan calendar,agree that the history of the world exists as four great cycles. Both systemsagree that we are in the final one of those cycles.Signs of the AgeIn addition to the consensus among Vedic scholars that there are four yugascontained within each cycle, it's also agreed that each one has a specificquality that it brings to the age when it appears. Each of these qualitiesdescribes a form of self-realization that relates to Earth's position in theheavens. The closer we are to our galaxy's core, the greater our degree ofenlightenment. At the most distant portions of our orbit, we must make greaterefforts to find our personal enlightenment.Tradition states that within each age there is a 25 percent change in the degreeof enlightenment of the collective culture from the previous cycle. So when weare in the ascending portion of the orbit that carries Earth closer to the MilkyWay's core, we become more conscious. When we're in the descending orbit thatcarries Earth away from the core, it's just the opposite. It's through thesequalities that we can see the gradual and temporary rise and fall of spiritualawareness that comes with our progression from the lightest to darkest cycles.> - According to traditional interpretations, the Satya Yuga is said to have> been the last golden age of light.

It's the similarities between thesequalities identified in ancient times and those that seem to permeate our worldtoday that make this ancient perspective so interesting. The dominant theme of aKali cycle is one of discord, contention, and quarrel. Examples of these traits\"include:> • The appearance of rulers who are unreasonable and levy taxes unfairly> • The time when people become addicted to intoxicating drinks> • The period when famine and death are common> • The age when the helpless become targets to be preyed uponMany of the preceding characteristics look surprisingly similar to those we findin our world today. If we are, in fact, living at the close of the Kali Yuga,then they are surprisingly accurate as well, especially when we consider thatthey were documented thousands of years ago.According to the Puranas, the traditional date for the beginning of the KaliYuga is February 18, 3102 B.C. On this date, mythology states that the Hindu godLord Krishna left the earth. While it's certainly difficult to confirm thedetails of Krishna's departure from this world more than 5,000 years ago, thereare astronomical events that mark this time as well. Their dates can be verifiedin historical accounts.The anonymous author of a 9th-century text, The Book of Thousands, describes apattern of galactic cycles that last for 180,000 years each, ending with theconjunction of all the planets of our solar system in the beginning of thezodiac sign of Aries.16 What makes this account so interesting is that the lastoccurrence of such a conjunction was the same time that a global \"deluge\" (whichsounds hauntingly like the biblical Great Flood) covered the earth. According tothe author's calculations, the date of the conjunction was the day before theKali Yuga began: February 17, 3102 B.C.While the traditional (divine) interpretation of the yuga cycles places the endof the Kali Yuga well into our future, it also states that a rare sub-cycleoccurs 5,000 years after the yuga begins. If, as tradition suggests, we are fivemillennia into the dark yuga that began in 3102 B.C., this places us more than110 years into the unique sub-cycle that began around 1898.This sub-cycle is akin to an oasis in the middle of a vast desert. It suggeststhat 5,000 years into the darkest portion of our journey through the stars, anawakening occurs that prepares us for the remainder of the dark cycle and forthe transition into the next yuga of light. This cycle-within-a-cycle isdescribed as a time of increased bhakti (Sanskrit for \"devotion\") influence. Itis a period of heightened devotion believed to last for about 10,000 years.\"While the realistic nature of such vast periods of time is still debated byscholars today, I describe this cycle and its duration here for one reason. Thefact that it lasts so long is a powerful indication that the Vedic traditions donot see 2012 and the end of our world age as the end of the planet itself.Rather, they seem to agree that the Kali Yuga's \"darkness\" is a time ofnecessary turmoil that makes way for our evolution from one way of being to thenext.Time Code 9: The Vedic traditions describe an extended time of devotion,expressed in action (bhakti), that began around 1898 and lasts well beyond the2012 Mayan end date.Regardless of whether or not we use the traditional interpretation of the yugas,the message of the cycles is the same. Either we are near, or at, the end or weare now in a special sub-cycle of the Kali Yuga, the briefest and darkest timein the Vedic worldview. Perhaps it's no coincidence that this dark yuga occursonly during the times when the Mayan calendar indicates that we're at thefarthest point from the center of the Milky Way.To get to such a point means that we have traveled a predictable path, marked bypredictable milestones, during a predictable length of time. While this iscommon knowledge to the Vedic scholars of today, just how well our ancestorsunderstood Earth's journey through the stars remains a topic of heated debate inscholarly circles.The Ancient Ages of an Ancient SkyTo help scientists validate astronomical alignments such as those of the Vedas,advanced computer programs now take the guesswork out of what the night sky mayhave looked like during the cycles of history in times past. Using simulationsproduced by software, such as SkyGlobe'\", we can now re-create any portion ofthe night sky from any period in the past, as well as project what the sky willlook like at any time in the future.1' The use of such software has become apowerful tool in exploring the theory that ancient temples, pyramids, andmonuments were built the way they were to match precise alignments with starsand constellations as they would have appeared in the past. In the mystery ofEgypt's Great Sphinx, for example, this kind of exploration adds to the mountingevidence that the structure was built long before the 2450 B.c. datetraditionally found in textbooks.Because Egypt's mysterious Sphinx is made in the image of half-man andhalf-lion, a growing number of scholars now suspect that it was built as alasting marker for the transition from the age of Virgo, the virgin, to that ofLeo, the lion, at the time when the world ages shifted in our distant past. Butif the transition from age to age is so gradual, then the question becomes:precisely when did it occur? Author and researcher Graham Hancock has pioneereda revolutionary perspective of our past and offers concrete evidence that mayfinally answer this question.In his book Heaven's Mirror, Hancock explains:> Computer simulations show that in 10,500 B.C. the constellation of Leo housed> the sun on the spring equinox. Specifically, the simulations show that during> the hour before dawn, the lion in the stars would have looked like it was> reclining to the east along the horizon, in precisely the place where the sun> would rise.Hancock elaborated on the significance of this correlation, stating:> This means that the lion-bodied Sphinx, with its due-east orientation, would> have gazed directly on that morning at the one constellation in the sky that> might reasonably be regarded as its own celestial counterpart.19That constellation is Leo.What does such a correlation tell us? Is it just a coincidence that the timelesssentinel of half-man and half-lion in Egypt's desert is precisely aligned withthe only constellation that bears its namesake? While this correlation may go along way toward solving the mystery of one of the best-known monuments in theworld, it also opens the door to even deeper questions.If the Sphinx was truly built to commemorate Earth's transition from theconstellation of Virgo to Leo, and it was built during the years around 10,500B.C. (approximately the time when the last ice age ended), who was here to buildit? Who in Egypt was tracking cycles of time that are so vast that it would taketechnology developed over 500 generations later to confirm them? Maybe moreimportant, why were they tracking those cycles?Why did civilizations from Egypt to the Yucatan dedicate entire temples, texts,and monuments in their time to immortalize a single date that would not occuruntil the end of time, more than 50 centuries into their future?[images/00034.jpg][images/00037.jpg]\"The ancients knew something which we seem to have forgotten.'- Albert Einstein (1879-1955), physicist\"By examining these core [Mayan] traditions, we can reconstruct and revive theoriginal 2012 revelation.\"- John Major Jenkins, contemporary expert on Mesoamerican cosmologyIt was a headline seen around the world. On July 6, 2008, the first news itemthat flashed to users across the Internet was an article titled \"ThousandsExpect Apocalypse in 2012,\" excerpted in part from an ABC News investigation ofthe global rise in \"doomsday cults.\" The first sentence of the article said itall: \"Survival groups around the world are gearing up and counting down to amysterious date that has been anticipated for thousands of years: December 21,2012.\"1Only weeks before, approximately two dozen members of a Russian survivalistgroup-mostly grown women, but including four children-had emerged from aunderground bunker where they had sealed themselves from the outside world inNovember 2007. The group was convinced that the unthinkable would happen wellbefore 2012. They fully believed that the world would end by May 2008, withinsix months of their entry. When it did not, the group's followers had begun totrickle out a few at a time over the winter. Following the tragic deaths andburials of two members within the bunker, the partial collapse of the cave'sceiling due to spring snowmelt, and a shortage of food, the remnants of thegroup emerged in May 2008.According to the article, while they seemed mystified as to why the world wasstill here, they were convinced that it was only their calculations that wereoff. They still believed that a great apocalypse and the end of the known worldwere just around the corner.As extreme as such beliefs and reactions may sound, they're not all that unusualthese days. The same article states, \"From across the United States, Canada andthroughout Europe, apocalyptic sects and individuals say that is the day[December 21, 2012] that the world as we know it will end.\"2While it's obvious that the year 2012 is on the minds of a lot of people today,when we step back for a bigger historical perspective, we discover that thesebeliefs are actually part of a tradition that began a very long time ago. Whilethere seem to be as many different ideas of what we can expect as there arepeople with such ideas, there also seems to be a general agreement as to thereason for the 2012 focus. It's all about our location in the heavens and thecycles of time that bring about the changes.History Points to NowAs we saw in Chapter 2, there is a universal consensus among the indigenouspeoples of the earth that our time-spanning the last years of the 20th centuryand the early years of the 21st century-is no ordinary period in the history ofhumankind or of the earth. With their prophecies, traditions, and systems oftimekeeping, they remind us that during our lifetime we'll experience a repeatof the cycle that sparked the dawn of recorded history.Over the centuries that followed the last shift of world ages, the themes ofwhat happened then, and humankind's response to it, have been incorporated intomyriad religious and spiritual practices. As diverse as they appear, the commonthread that joins them together offers a clear message for us today. It's onlyin recent times, with the aid of 20th-century science, that their message hasstarted to make sense.What a message it is! Using everything from prophetic visions to the dates ofprecise astronomical alignments, our ancestors devised every method imaginableto alert us to a single fact: now is the time of the most extraordinaryconditions and opportunities that accompany the rarest of events, the shift fromone world age to the next.[images/00031.jpg]The ancient Aztec traditions of central Mexico share the Mayan belief that theuniverse exists as great waves of energy that repeat as cycles of time. A keyaspect of their understanding is that each cycle has a unique characteristicbased upon the wave that carries it. As the wave ripples through creation, itsmovement synchronizes nature, life, and time with its passing. It's from theirunderstanding of such waves that the ancient Aztec timekeepers knew that ourmoment in history would bring the beginning of a new cycle that they simplycalled a \"sun.\"The Aztec cosmology describes the history of the Earth as a series of such suns.The first, named Nahui-Ocelotl, was characterized as a time when giant creatureslived within the earth. As strange as it may sound, this account actually soundssimilar to biblical ones that describe a time in our past when humansencountered larger-than-life creatures. According to the Aztecs, this periodended when the animal kingdom overcame the human kingdom.The second sun, named Nahui Ehecatl, was noted as a time when humans learned tocultivate and crossbreed plants. This cycle ended with what is described as agreat wind that swept across the earth, clearing everything in its path.During the third sun, Nahui Quiahuitl, the people of the earth formed hugecities and great temples. The Aztecs describe a phenomenon that occurred duringthis time: the Earth opened and the sky was filled with a \"rain of fire.\" Thegeological record does, in fact, show a time in our past when portions of theearth were covered with fire. The ash that is found in the rock record isgenerally believed to have come from the impact of a huge object from space,possibly an asteroid, about 65 million years ago. The fourth sun ended with aglobal cooling that is also confirmed in the geological record.According to the Aztec traditions, today we are living in the last days of thefifth sun. The timing for the next Aztec sun is based on the same cycles thatthe Maya used in their calendar. With these relationships in mind, the fifth sunof the Aztecs is believed to occur within the same zone of time as the Mayan2012 alignment. As with the other Mesoamerican traditions, modern Aztecs andMaya believe that the chaos triggered by the end-ofcycle changes is a necessarypassage of purification to pave the way for a better world to follow.Modern Prophets of the New World AgeThe visions of a world-age transition, and what follows it, extend far beyondthe ancient and indigenous worldviews into the era of recorded history. For morethan 400 years such visions of the future have fallen into the realm ofprophecy, and the word itself has been nearly synonymous with the names of greatseers such as Edgar Cayce and Nostradamus.Born in 1503, Nostradamus was fascinated by the profound visions of ancientoracles and studied them to work on his own techniques of prophecy. Using whathe learned, Nostradamus developed a gift of second sight that allowed him topeer-to remote-view-well into his future and even beyond ours, to witness eventsthat had yet to occur with extraordinary detail and accuracy. In what isarguably his best-known work, Centuries, he recorded what he saw from hisvantage point in the 16th century, through the next ten centuries, and then evenbeyond our time, ending in the year A.D. 3797. Some scholars believe his futuresight may have extended even further.Because of the stigma surrounding the use of prophecy in his time, Nostradamuscouldn't write about his visions directly. Instead he recorded them in a codedformat called quatrainsmysterious verses of four lines each. By the time of hisdeath, Nostradamus had set down his visions for each century as 100 verses ofsuch quatrains. While many of the things that Nostradamus recorded do appear tobe surprisingly accurate, just as we find for other prophecies, without specificdates they are open to interpretation.Among the dates that are noted, however, are the specifics for the two worldwars that cannot be mistaken. Nostradamus also recorded Hitler's name and adescription of the swastika; the discoveries of penicillin, nuclear energy, andthe AIDS virus; the failure of Communism; and the assassination of U.S.President John F. Kennedy. Even though the interpretations are subjective,scholars generally agree that he did foresee a great change on a global scalearound the transition from the 20th to the 21st century. Similar to the NativeAmerican and biblical traditions, the changes that Nostradamus witnessed in hisvisions were accompanied by tremendous cataclysm.Only when he felt that the event in his vision was critical or urgent didNostradamus include an actual date. On the rare occasions that he did so, thosedates have become the touchstones to orient us in history for the things thathappen before and after. For this reason, I find it fascinating that one ofthose rare dates occurs in the late 20th century. In his book Centuries X,quatrain number 72 reads: \"In the year 1999 and seven months, / A great King ofTerror will come from the sky. / He will bring back the great King Genghis Khan[of the Mongols] / Before and after Mars [war] rules happily. \"3In the Epistle to Henry II, verse 87, Nostradamus further clarifies this time inhistory, stating, \". . . this will be preceded by a solar eclipse more obscureand more dark . . . than any since the creation of the world except that afterthe death and passion of Jesus Christ. \"4A solar eclipse that was visible throughout much of Europe did occur on August11, 1999. In verse 88, Nostradamus continues describing the cataclysmic natureof his millennial vision, identifying a specific month of Earth changes: \". . .and there shall be in the month of October a great movement of the globe, and itwill be such that one will think the Earth has lost its natural [gravitational]movement ... there will be initial omens in the spring, and extraordinarychanges in rapid succession thereafter, reversals of kingdoms and mightyearthquakes ...\"5While there have, in fact, been record-setting earthquakes (the 2004 IndianOcean quake registered between 9.1 and 9.3 on the Richter scale) and nations,such as Iraq and Afghanistan, have certainly changed their affiliations andforms of government, it's difficult to say that these are precisely the thingsthat Nostradamus saw in his visions. What's important here is that although thespecifics of Nostradamus's future sight may vary from those of other prophetsand prophecies, the general theme of a great change at century's end does not.Although they were born 374 years apart, there is a surprising consistencybetween Nostradamus and the man known as the \"Sleeping Prophet\" in the 20thcentury, Edgar Cayce.In what have become some of his best-known prophecies, Cayce stated that thelate 20th and early 21st centuries would herald a time of unprecedented shiftsupon the earth. Just as many ancient prophecies described two paths that couldcarry humankind through such an upheaval, Cayce foresaw the possibility of afuture brought about by gradual change as well as a time of tumultuous shiftsthat are obviously catastrophic in nature. What makes his prophecies especiallysignificant, however, is that he saw both possibilities happening during thesame period of time.During his lifetime, Cayce gave approximately 14,000 readings that cover topicsranging from the diagnosis of ailments for specific individuals to the futureand fate of humankind and the world. In reading number 826-8, which is datedAugust 1936, Cayce was asked specifically about the kind of changes he foresawfor the millennium that would not happen for another 64 years into his future.His response was a tangible statement regarding a measurable change for theEarth: \"... there is the shifting of the pole. Or a new cycle begins.\"6The rapid decline in the magnetic fields of the Earth-the kind that precedes amagnetic reversal of the poles-has led some scientists to speculate that we maybe in the early stages of just such a shift. In the absence of extenuatingcircumstances, however, and with the insights from our Time Code Calculator (seeChapter 6), it appears unlikely that such a shift will occur in the yearsimmediately before or following 2012.Although a number of Cayce's early predictions for the new millennium soundcatastrophic, later readings take on an interesting, although subtle, change.Reading number 1152-11 in 1939 describes the close of the century as a series ofgradual changes rather than the sudden shifts he previously foresaw. Once again,Cayce shares his future visions with the specifics of an actual date. He states,\"In 1998 we will find a great deal of activity that has been created by thegradual changes that are coming about.\"'He continues: \"As to the changes, the change between the Piscean and theAquarian Age is gradual, not a cataclysmic one.\"8In Chapter 7, we will explore the concept of choice points, a physics term thatdescribes moments in time where our choices seem to have a greater impact on theway something turns out. While Princeton University's Hugh Everett III coinedthe term itself in 1957, Cayce seems to be describing just such a point in hisreading numbered 311-10. Here, he suggests that our response to the challengesof our lives may determine, at least in part, how much of the changes he foresawfor the millennium shift we would actually experience: \"[It] may depend uponmuch that deals with the metaphysical.... There are those conditions that in theactivity of individuals, in line of thought and endeavor, keep oft many a cityand many land intact through their application of spiritual laws. \"The prophecies of Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, the Aztecs, the Hopi, the Maya, andothers have sent the reverberations of an unmistakable message throughout time.Separated by hundreds of years of history and thousands of miles of distance,all point to now. They all see something powerful, possibly wonderful andpossibly destructive, happening on a global scale during a time that spans thelast years of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st century.The odds against such similar stories developing \"out of nowhere\" for suchvastly different people and places suggest that this is more than simply acoincidence. What did they know that we've forgotten? Why did the Mayantimekeepers choose 2012 rather than the 2000 millennium date as the end of theircalendar? What difference could those 12 years possibly make in the ending of a5,125-year-long cycle?Perhaps the best way to answer that question is through a better understandingof the Maya themselves. To appreciate just what the Mayan calendar and the endof time means, we must look beyond the calendar itself. Its symbols and codesare the lasting legacy of an obsession with vast cycles of time and ourrelationship to that time. It's the Maya's advanced knowledge of the cosmos andtheir ability to preserve it for generations to come that modern archaeologistshave called the \"Mayan mystery.\"The Mayan MysteryThe Mayan civilization itself is an anomaly in the traditional view of historyand culture. Archaeological studies in Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of Hondurasand Belize show that the advanced architecture, cosmic observatories, andprecise calendars that come to mind when we think of the Maya appeared\"suddenly\" in the historical sense.In his exploration of this ancient mystery, archaeologist Charles Gallenkamp,the author of Maya: The Riddle and Rediscovery of a Lost Civilization,graphically summarizes the irony of the Mayan presence. \"No one hassatisfactorily explained where [or when] Maya civilization originated,\" hestates, \"or how it evolved in an environment so hostile to human habitation.\"10It's the advanced technology used by the Classic Maya that sets them apart fromthe village cultures that came before. Michael D. Coe, emeritus professor ofanthropology and emeritus curator in the Peabody Museum of Natural History atYale University, describes this technology beautifully in his book The Maya:> The Classic Maya of the lowlands had a very elaborate calendar; writing;> temple-pyramids and palaces of limestone masonry with vaulted rooms;> architectural layouts emphasizing buildings arranged around plazas with rows> of stellae lined up before some; polychrome pottery; and a very sophisticated> art style expressed in bas-reliefs and in wall paintings.11It is this high level of sophistication and the widespread influence of theircivilization that makes the collapse of the Classic Maya so mysterious. Althoughthere are many theories, no one has definitively solved what is called the\"Mayan riddle.\" Charles Gallenkamp elaborates on how little we may actually knowabout our ancient ancestors, observing that whatever it was that led to \"thesudden abandonment of their greatest cities during the ninth century A.D.-one ofthe most baffling archaeological mysteries ever uncovered-is still deeplyshrouded in conjecture.\"12While the experts may not agree on precisely why such a powerful civilizationseems to have disappeared, they can't argue over the marvel of what was leftbehind: temples, observatories, and sophisticated calculations of time.To put the Mayan phenomenon into perspective, their science and their messagecould only make sense to the modern world with the emergence of computers andsatellite probes in recent years. How could a group of people living in thejungles of Mexico a millennia and a half ago have known so much? To answer thisquestion we must begin with another one: that is simply ... why?Why did an advanced civilization suddenly appear more than 2,000 years ago,build massive temples and observatories focused on huge galactic cycles, andthen vanish? Why does their calendar, identifying cycles that coincide with the5,000 years of recorded human history, abruptly end on such a precise date-onethat occurs within our lifetime?[images/00033.jpg]Figure 6.

(Stela Copyright (0 2000, 2001, 2002 used with permissionunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Free Software Foundation,Inc.)It's impossible to answer these questions by simply looking at the Mayancalendar itself. It's also impossible to unlock the secret of Mayan timekeepingby looking at traditional history itself. To do either is to miss the power andelegance of the message that our Mayan ancestors left to us. There is only oneway to answer these questions, and that is to think differently about ourrelationship to the universe than we have since the birth of science 300 yearsago.We must cross the traditional boundaries that have separated science, religion,spirituality, and history-both past and presentand marry these many sources ofknowledge into a single new wisdom. When we do, something remarkable happens!Mayan TimeAny discussion of Mayan accomplishments must acknowledge what is arguably thesingle most sophisticated achievement of all: their unsurpassed calculation oftime. Even today, modern Maya keep track of great cycles, as well as local time,using this system that experts such as archaeologist and anthropologist MichaelD. Coe tell us has \"not slipped one day in over twenty-five centuries. 1113Their calculations were based upon their calendar. But it represents much morethan simply counting the number of days between the full moon and the new moon.The Maya were tracking cosmic cycles of time, along with the celestial eventsthat occur during that time. Using the most advanced system of calendars theworld has seen until modern times, they did something that is almost unthinkableto us today. In the absence of high-speed computers and complex software, theycalculated the movement of the earth and our entire solar system as it relatesto the core of our own Milky Way galaxy.The key to the Mayan \"galactic timer\" was a 260-day count called the Tzolkin, orSacred Calendar. Intermeshed with another 365-day calendar, called the VagueYear, the Maya viewed these two cycles of time as progressing like the cogs oftwo wheelsprogress that would continue until the rare moment when one day on theSacred Calendar matched the same on the Vague Year. That rare and powerful daymarked the end of a 52-year cycle and was part of the even larger expanse oftime known by the Maya as the great cycle.At present, there is no one artifact known to represent the Mayan calendar inits entirety. While modern scholars are able to interpret the Mayan system oftimekeeping from their inscriptions, there is another ancient artifact fromanother culture that has preserved the Mayan view of time as a single calendarand is still in use today. It's the Aztec Stone of the Sun (Piedra del Sol), theancient calendar disk pictured in Figure 7. This monolithic artifact wasdiscovered during excavations in Mexico City's main plaza in 1790.[images/00036.jpg]Figure 7. There is no single artifact that represents the entire system of Mayancalendars. The ancient Aztec calendar on the left is believed to be derived fromthe Mayan calculations of time. The themes of the present world age and the fourprevious world ages can be seen clearly in the magnified illustration of thecalendar on the right.The huge basalt disk measures about 12 feet in diameter, is almost 4 feet thick,and weighs nearly 53,000 pounds.'` While the interpretations of the disksometimes differ in specifics, with new understandings of the Aztec symbols,there seems to be a general agreement as to what it represents. What follows isa high-level description of the key glyphs on the Stone of the Sun. I offer ithere to show that the architects of the disk had a deep understanding of cosmiccycles and their relationship to the days of the month.15When we look at the Aztec calendar in Figure 7, the most striking image is theface in the center of the disk. The Aztecs accepted the doctrine of World Agesand, like the Maya, believed that we are living in the fifth and final world ofa cycle that included four previous ones. The center image is Tonatiuh, meaning\"movement of the sun\" or \"sun of movement,\" the god of our fifth world. Somescholars interpret the movement implied by the Tonatiuh's role in the cycle as apossible clue to the mystery of what happens at the end of the age.Surrounding Tonatiuh, four boxes represent where we've been in this cycle: thefour suns of ages past. The glyph for each is the deity associated with thatparticular age. Moving clockwise from the upper left, we find the symbols forwind, jaguar, water, and fire. There is still uncertainty as to whether or notthese glyphs represent the dominant theme of the age or the cause of its end.Moving outward from the circle of world ages, the next ring we see contains 20squares that depict the 20 days of the Aztec month. The eight arrows (angles)that point away from this circle are the eight cardinal points of the sun's rays(north, northeast, east, southeast, and so on).At the bottom of the disk (not pictured) are the symbols of two serpents. Eachis divided into sections believed to represent the limbs of jaguars and flames.While scholars have yet to arrive at a consensus as to precisely what thesesymbols mean, it is generally believed that they represent the 52-year cycles ofthe Aztec century, which is also 52 years long.The images on the Aztec disk are intact, readable, and still used today by theindigenous peoples of Central America. On replicas found throughout Mexico andthe Yucatan, this ancient map of time is the standard for everything fromsetting daily watches to planting annual crops. To those knowing the language ofthe disk, it's a beautiful map of our relationship to time, covering everythingfrom thousands of years to the present moment.Reading the Mayan Map of TimeThe Aztec calendar is just one artifact, representing only a partialunderstanding of the Mayan system of timekeeping. While many of the subtletiesare missing, the Stone of the Sun still conveys the big message of the greatcycle.The date that both the Mayan and Aztec calendars indicate as the end of thepresent cycle is the same: December 21, 2012. On this day, the winter solsticesignals the close of the present world age, the calendar resets itself, and webegin a new world age. Similar to the way the odometers on some cars return toall zeros after reaching the 100,000-mile mark, the Mayan calendar \"resets\" to anew start date of zero and the cycle begins anew. The Mayan timekeepers encodedthe end date and the system that keeps track of it into the massive tablets andtemples they built throughout territory that is now Mexico and Guatemala.While Mayan priests marked the key dates for these cycles on their monumentsmore than 2,000 years ago, it was not until early in the 20th century that theirmessage made sense within the framework of our familiar Gregorian calendar. Itwas during this time that the original calculation of Mayan scholar Joseph T.Goodman (1905) was confirmed by Yucatan scholar Juan Martinez Hernandez (1926)and English archaeologist J. Eric S. Thompson (1935) and has become thegenerally accepted date for the beginning of the Mayan great cycle.In recognition of each man's contribution to it, the result of the mutual effortuses one letter from each scholar's name and is called the GMT correlation.Based on this understanding and the traditions of the Mayan priests themselves,the calendars indicate that the last great cycle began on the Mayan date0.0.0.0.0, which translates to August 11, 3114 B.C.16When I read about such an ancient date, if I can think of it in terms ofsomething else that was happening at the same time, it helps me to grasp itsmeaning. So as a reference point for the start of the current great cycle, thebeginning identified by the ancient calendar is about the same time that thefirst hieroglyphs appeared in ancient Egypt. From that point to today, thebalance of the cycle encompasses the entire span of time that we typically thinkof as recorded human history.What Does It Mean?The Mayan timekeepers were obviously tracking more than the minutes of the daywith their calendars. They were using their sophisticated timepieces to countdown the years that would culminate with a rare celestial event. Through hisscholarly diligence, John Major Jenkins recognized that event in the 1980s, andwith that recognition, we now know why the end of our particular cycle was soimportant and so anticipated by the Maya.At the end of the cycle, our solar system, our sun, and our planet move into analignment with the core of the Milky Way galaxy, or more precisely, with theequator of the galaxy-an alignment that will not happen again for another 26,000years.\" While it does mark the end of this particular great cycle, the Mayantradition says that the end is the beginning that we've been waiting for.From the Mayan perspective of cosmology and myth, consciousness and humanawareness progress through stages of growth that cover the vast periods of timeencompassed by the cycles. With each new cycle, we have the opportunity to movebeyond the thinking that has limited or destroyed us in the past. This growth isachieved as cycles within cycles that create the gestation period mentioned inthe last chapter.Jenkins eloquently describes this idea of human life cycles within cosmic,spiritual cycles: \"The 260-day tzolkin calendar is based upon the 260-day periodof human embryogenesis, and, on a higher level, the 260-day tzolkin symbolizes,or structures, the 26,000-year period of precession, what we might call humanspiritual embryogenesis.\"18Time Code 10: The present world age began on August 11, 3114 B.C. Its end issignaled by the rare alignment of our solar system with the core of the MilkyWay galaxy on December 21, 201 2-an event that last occurred approximately26,000 years ago.Modern scientists acknowledge that this galactic alignment is happening. Theyalso acknowledge that the Mayan calendar marks the event. \"There's no questionthat one of the great cycles of the traditional ancient Mayan calendar comes toa completion of its count at that time in 2012,\" says E. C. Krupp, Ph.D.,director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California.\" The questionmost often asked is simply, \"What does it mean?\" On the one hand, there arethose who discount the phenomenon as little more than an interesting oddity thatwe are lucky to see in our lifetime. Others suggest that the close of the greatcycle marks the convergence of rare cosmic processes, with implications thatrange from the joyous to the frightening.Jose Arguelles, Ph.D., author of The Mayan Factor, which sparked a moderninterest in Mayan time during the 1980s, suggests, for example, that the firstyears of the new millennium are part of a sub-cycle that began in 1992 and markthe emergence of what he calls \"non-materialistic, ecologically harmonictechnologies ... to complement the new decentralized mediarchy informationsociety ...\"20Using the same information, however, other scientists and researchers have avery different idea of just what the Mayan calendar is showing. They warn thatthe end of the Mayan great cycle coincides with celestial events that may holdprofound and even dangerous consequences for life on Earth as we know it. IndiaDaily, an online magazine based in India, for example, carried an editorialarticle in the March 1, 2005, edition describing the results of the HyderabadComputer Model for a polar shift to coincide with calendar's end date. Itsfrightening headline reads: \"Computer Models Predict Magnetic Pole Reversal inEarth and Sun Can Bring End to Human Civilization in 2012,\" and the editorialdescribes a worst-case scenario of what a world without a magnetic field couldmean .21These are obviously two very different ideas of what we can expect the end ofthe great cycle to bring our way. That is precisely why I'm sharing them here.While in later chapters we will explore possibilities ranging from peace to apolar shift, the point is that Mayan timekeepers were trying to tell us about adate that none of them would even live to see.While there are many ideas of what we may expect as the end date of the Mayancalendar draws near, most people feel that something is going to happen. Because2012 is only a few short years away and it happens to coincide withunprecedented changes that are already happening in our solar system as wespeak, a growing number of scientists suggest that it is in our best interest tounderstand what the Mayan timekeepers were trying to tell us.The best place to begin is with the Mayan calendar itself. Perhaps retiredCalifornia State University professor Ricardo Duran says it best. In aninterview discussing the significance of the 2012 end date, Duran explains, \"It[the last day of the cycle] is called a four movement day. That's the name ofthe date, and this means a very profound change by movement.\"22Two Cycles, Same End DateIn addition to the 2012 winter solstice marking the end of the Mayan GreatCycle, December 21 also signals the completion of an even larger cycle: thegreat or precessional year that began approximately 26,000 years ago. It wasthen that we began the journey that carries us through the celestial path of all12 signs of the zodiac. As we cross the threshold of the Milky Way's equator inthe 2012 time frame, we not only begin a new 5,125-year-long world age, but wealso complete one precessional year of all 12 zodiac constellations and beginthe next.The rarity of these two cycles completing simultaneously, and the fact that weare living at a time when they converge, tells us beyond any doubt that theseare truly extraordinary days. This also adds credibility to the wisdom of theancient timekeepers who have held the knowledge of this convergence of cyclesfor thousands of years until modern science could accept its meaning.Although the details of the Mayan cycles sometimes differ from those of theworld's oldest cosmologies, in general the similarities are striking. Thefollowing chart summarizes parallels to the Vedic system of yugas.[images/00021.jpg]Figure 8. The accounts of world ages recorded in Vedic and Mayan writings arestrikingly similar. Both describe the beginning of our present age approximately5,000 years ago as a portion of a greater cycle. Both describe a momentouschange expected approximately 5,000 years into the cycle that coincides with arare astronomical alignment that will not recur for another approximately 26,000years.Both traditions state that we are presently in the last cycle of a great worldage. Both cycles are believed to have started approximately 5,000 years ago, andthere is a difference of only 12 years between their dates of origin. With suchclose agreement between two very different civilizations existing on twodifferent parts of Earth, and in light of the accuracy of additional cosmictimelines (such as the agreement between the scientific and Hindu versions ofEarth's age), we owe it to ourselves to ask, \"What are these cycles of timetelling us?\"To answer such a question, we must take a deeper look into an experience socommon that we seldom give it a second thought. At the same time, it's one thatis so puzzling to scientists that modern physicists even have a special way ofreferring to it when they consider solutions to the mysteries of the universe.As we'll see in the next chapter, it's called the \"problem of time.\" The answerto what 2012 means in our lives comes down to our understanding of themysterious essence of time itself.[images/00041.jpg][images/00042.jpg]\"Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.\"- Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), astronomer\"God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world.\"- Paul Dirac (1902-1984), physicist, 1933 Nobel Prize laureateAny discussion of time and the 2012 Mayan calendar end date would be incompletewithout mention of ethnobotanist and visionary author Terence McKenna. Beforehis death in April 2000, McKenna was exploring time in a way that sounds morelike the wisdom of an ancient shaman than that of a 20thcentury researcher. Thatmay be precisely where the inspiration for his powerful ideas came from.Co-authored with his brother, Dennis, McKenna's books True Hallucinations andThe Invisible Landscape describe how their experiences with indigenous people inthe jungles of Colombia led them to think of time and the way things changewithin it as waves that have structure and lead somewhere.'Time Wave Zero"},{"pageContent":"In 1998, McKenna sent me a copy of his TimeWave Zero software, a computerprogram he had developed to open a window of insight into the past, as well asour present time in history. Due to compatibility issues between his program andmy computer, I never had the opportunity to actually use TimeWave Zero. It wasthe letter that McKenna included in his correspondence, his innovative thinking,and his marriage of science and indigenous tradition that intrigued me. Just asI had found in my pilgrimages from Egypt to Peru, he agreed with the ancientidea of time as a moving essence that travels in cycles across the universe. Itwas the way he thought of those cycles that made me want to read more.Using the King Wen sequence of the I Ching (the ancient Chinese \"Book ofChanges\") as a key, McKenna believed that he had found a way to plot the newnessand growing complexity of change throughout the course of time. He called theseunique conditions \"novelty.\" According to McKenna, when novelty is plotted on achart, a special waveform known as timewave zero, or simply the timewave,results.2The reason why I mention McKenna's TimeWave Zero program here is because of itsresults. There is a single year that it identifies as the point when we canexpect what he called maximum complexity and novelty in our world. It probablycomes as no surprise that it's also the one that's already deeply ingrained intoour collective psyche: the 2012 end of the Mayan great cycle.In McKenna's own words, he described the significance of his program and what hebelieved it revealed. \"We are on the brink of possibilities that will make usliterally unrecognizable to ourselves,\" he stated, \"and those possibilities willbe realized, not in the next thousand years but in the next 20 years because theacceleration of invention and novelty and information transfer is at this pointso rapid.\"3 In other words, McKenna's program identified 2012 as the time whenall combinations of everything that we may conceive of in our minds becomepossible at once.Without a doubt, McKenna's idea of novelty has opened the door to newpossibilities in our understanding of time. The mathematics supporting his workis complex. To some, it's also controversial. Before his death, he andmathematician Matthew Watkins worked together to identify the strengths andweaknesses in his program.' Using Watkins's discoveries, nuclear physicist JohnSheliak then revised McKenna's original software to correct for the errors thatwere identified.'As we approach 2012, McKenna's ideas and his TimeWave Zero program continue tooffer the framework for insights into the meaning of this date. Even after itpasses, however, I have no doubt that his work will continue to pave the way fornew understandings of nature's cycles.While McKenna's ideas offer powerful insights into life's complexity, to answermy questions about 2012 I needed more than the information his program couldprovide. If the events of the past do, in fact, become the seeds of futureconditions, I had to understand the patterns themselves. I needed to find therhythms that repeat from cycle to cycle, rather than the novelty of events andwhen they converge.The Simple UniverseEdward Teller, the man known as the \"father\" of the hydrogen bomb, once said,\"The main purpose of science is simplicity.\" Clarifying what he meant, Tellerconcluded, \"As we understand more things, everything is becoming simpler.\"6 Frommy experience as a scientist and a student of ancient cultures, I have foundthat this principle seems to be universal. The more we understand about life andnature, the simpler things appear to become. This includes the secrets of theuniverse itself.We can describe the forces of nature in technical terms that give scientists thevocabulary to explore our world. But my sense is that we don't need to. When weget right down to the essence of what makes the universe tick, thoseunderstandings are, in fact, based in simple ideas. While the laws of nature andtime certainly exist in the universe on a huge scale, they are still grounded invery simple concepts. They unfold in simple ways in our lives. And they can beshared simply through words and examples that make them meaningful. So itappears that nature and time are only as complex as we choose to make them.The key to making sense of the big things in the universe is to understand whatmakes those things work on a small scale. Then we can apply what we've learnedto the larger world. That's precisely how one of the greatest minds of the 20thcentury reached one of the most profound conclusions about reality itself. Hetook a principle that he was developing on a small scale at his desk andwondered if it could apply to the whole universe. The implications of what hefound now form the basis for an entire branch of science, one that is justcoming into its own during the early years of the 21st century.Nature's ProgramsIn the 1940s, Konrad Zuse, the man credited with developing the first moderncomputers, had a flash of insight into the way the universe may work. While hewas developing the simple programs to run those early computers, he asked aquestion that sounds more like the plot of a novel than something meant to betaken as a serious scientific possibility.What Zuse wondered was simply this: is it possible that the entire universeoperates like the computers I am building? This is clearly a huge question, withimplications that rattle everything from the ideas of life and evolution to thebasis of religion itself. These are the same implications that spawned thehugely popular 1999 film The Matrix.In the 1940s, Zuse was obviously a man ahead of his time. In recent years, newdiscoveries have directed scientists right back to his original ideas. In 2006,Seth Lloyd, the designer of the first feasible quantum computer, took Zuse'sthought of a computerlike universe one step further. In light of new technologyand new discoveries, he elevated it from a question of \"What if\" to thestatement of \"It is.\" Based upon his research in the new field of digitalphysics, Lloyd describes the implications of an emerging view of reality: \"Thehistory of the universe is, in effect, a huge and ongoing quantum computation.\"'Just in case there is any doubt in our minds about precisely what Lloyd issaying here, he clarifies his ideas. Rather than suggesting that the universemay be like a quantum computer, he blasts us into the most radical descriptionof reality to emerge in the last 2,000 years, stating: \"The universe is aquantum computer.\"8 From Lloyd's perspective, everything that exists is theoutput of the universe's computer. \"As the computation proceeds, realityunfolds,\" he explains.The reason comparing the universe to a computer is important is that regardlessof its size or how sophisticated it may appear, each computer follows the samebasic principle: it uses programs to get things done. With this in mind, thesimilarities between nature and a computer become obvious. In both, there arecodes that make things happen. If we can understand the codes, then we canunderstand how things work and how to make changes when we need to.While some people may find the thought of life's beauty stemming from a\"program\" somewhat unsettling, except for the language it may not be sodifferent from what our own science has already discovered. The definition of aprogram is that it's a code that \"sets a series of events into motion.\" We knowthat from atoms to cells, from orbits to seasons, the universe keeps itselfgoing by following patterns. We also know that those patterns repeat as cycles.These are the programs of nature.Nature's programs exist because something, or someone, has put them there. Whilethe descriptions of that something or someone range from \"colliding particlesreleasing energy\" to \"God,\" the principle is the same: there is a great cosmicengine that drives things forward. So it's really not such a stretch to say thatthe universe, and everything in it, is what and where it is because acode-nature's program-has put it there.The key to understanding such a cosmic program is to recognize what it does-thepatterns that it creates. And to work with those patterns, we must understandthe numbers that make them possible. Because nature operates on simpleprinciples, it should come as no surprise to discover that the numbersdescribing nature's cycles are simple as well.Nobel Prize-winning physicist Paul Dirac captured the essence of thissimplicity: \"God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world.\"10 The beautyis found in the elegant simplicity. In a very real sense, when we understand thenumbers that make natural cycles possible, we are also learning the language ofGod. When we learn to apply those numbers to bridge the past and the future, weare speaking the divine language of the great programmer of the universe.While there are textbooks full of complex mathematics that describe nature'scodes, our ancestors left us the same ideas as the two simple keys that areexplained in the following section. Through the powerful number that seems togovern so many of nature's patterns and their precise repetition, thescientistshamans of our past created a beautiful bridge between the worlds ofsensual beauty and time's cycles. Through that bridge, the secret of timebecomes obvious: it's all about recognizing the way cycles of patterns play outin our lives.Patterns: Nature's Keys to the UniverseMy first winter in northern New Mexico's high desert happened to be one of thecoldest ever entered in the record books. Even the elders of the nearby nativepueblos said that no one remembered it having been so cold, for so long, asduring the dry winters of the early 1990s. While my scientific mind knew thatcold air is heavier than warm air and tends to settle in the valleys at night,until that first winter I never really realized just how cold those nights couldbe. The first December evening that I walked outside my house to look at thestars and check the thermometer near the woodpile, I found out.I quickly learned that high-desert valleys could create dangerous conditionswhere bare skin can freeze in minutes. After I tapped the mercury a couple oftimes to make sure the reading wasn't stuck, I dashed back inside for a warmercoat. The temperature was 50 degrees below zero!When the sun came up the next morning and temperatures rose into the mid-40sabove zero, I drove into town. Everywhere I went the conversation was the same.People were talking about the record cold and what it had done to theirlivestock, water pipes, and crops the night before. One man at the localhardware store, who'd had to be on the job before the sun warmed the world,found that morning as he rolled out of his driveway that the rubber on his tireshad become so brittle from the cold that they had actually cracked and broken.Later that night, the temperatures dropped again, and once more thermometersread nearly 50 degrees below zero.While I was walking in the fields surrounding my home the next day, I noticedthat the occasional anthills dotting the property seemed to be larger thannormal-and not just a little larger: these were anthills that measured a footand a half or more above the ground and could be seen for acres before I got tothem! There were some that even towered above the sage plants and desert shrubsthat grow wild in the valley. I knew that for the mounds to be so large, theants had to go really deep into the ground. I also knew that the deeper antcolonies built their tunnels into the earth, the warmer the temperatures of theground surrounding them became. What I didn't know was if there was a linkbetween these facts and the record temperatures. In other words, had the antssomehow \"known\" that an extremely cold winter was on the way and built theirhomes accordingly?The next winter, the weather patterns changed. While the December temperatureswere still cold and well below the zero mark, they were not 50 degrees below.Throughout the autumn I had watched the anthills across the fields and noticedthat they didn't seem to be as big as the year before. Hmm, I thought, maybe theants are telling us that this won't be such a cold winter.I soon discovered that what I'd seen in my fields is part of wellknown loreamong the native people and historical residents of the high deserts. It's apattern. And that pattern is part of a cycle. It's as predictable and reliableas any high-tech forecasts from the computer models, but it comes even earlierthan they do.The pattern is clear: the higher the mounds, the deeper the ants have tunneledinto the ground, and the colder the winter will be. By the time the trees beginto turn in the fall, if the ants go really deep, it means that I can eitherschedule my seminars in a part of the world where the temperatures are at leasta little above zero at night ... or stock up on some extra firewood. The pointis that the anthills and the weather are patterns that can be recognized.Together, their cyclic patterns are part of even larger patterns of seasons. Thepatterns are consistent, and they appear like clockwork.The more we learn about our relationship to nature and time, the clearer it isthat patterns and the cycles of time are more than simply an interestingphenomenon of life. The cycles of time are life. In fact, it's fair to say thatfor everything from the biology of DNA and the laws of physics to the history ofour planet and the evolution of the universe, our world of matter follows veryprecise rules that allow things to \"be\" as they are.While it may sound like the only time we escape the effect of cycles is at theend of life, even in death we appear to be part of a larger cycle. Almostuniversally, our most cherished spiritual traditions remind us that death ismerely the end of one cycle and part of a greater one that mirrors thecreation/destruction/birth/death theme of the universe itself.With these ideas in mind, nature offers us two powerful keys that make itpossible to predict repeating patterns in the cycles of time. Regardless of thescale, whether the cycles last for a nanosecond or for tens of thousands ofyears, the keys work the same way.> • The first key is the principle of fractals. These are the patterns that> nature uses to fill the space of the universe.> • The second key is the golden ratio. This is the number that determines how> frequently nature repeats the fractals that fill space.Separately, each key stands on its own as a powerful tool to understandingeverything from the secrets of atoms and the inner workings of solar systems tothe cycles of personal success and betrayal. Combined, they offer anunprecedented insight into the language of time itself.As we'll see in the following chapters, when we apply these two simple keys totime-past, present, and future-we open the door to powerful insights into whenand how often we can anticipate the greatest threats to our careers, our way oflife, our civilization, and even our future. If we know when to expect theconditions, we also know how to change the circumstances.Before we can do any of this, however, we must understand our two keys: thenature of fractal patterns and the ancient secret of the golden ratio.Fractals: The Code Within the Code Within the Code ...In the late 1990s, I had the opportunity to put all of the organizational andplanning skills I'd developed in the corporate world to good use for my ownfamily. It was time to move my mother from her home in one city to a differenthome in a different city. I quickly found, as anyone who has ever embarked uponsuch a mission has already discovered, that the move itself was the easy part.It was the preparation that had to happen before that became the project of alifetime.Mom had made the decision that this move was a special one and she was going todo it differently than any she had ever done in the past. Celebrating goodhealth, new beginnings, and new surroundings, in an effort to streamline herlife she had chosen this move as the one to downsize. This meant that everythingshe had accumulated for decades would be examined and evaluated, and the thingsthat she no longer needed would find a new home. So before we could even beginto pack, we had to choose what would make the journey.As we sifted through the boxes and bags that held the accumulated history of ourentire family, we found ourselves engrossed in the memories and the meaning thatthe contents brought to mind. Every few minutes I would hear Mom's excited voicecoming from somewhere behind a stack of boxes taller than she was, asking me tolook at the treasures she had rediscovered. \"Oh, look at this,\" she would say,holding up something that my brother or I had made for her more than 30 yearsbefore.There was the Valentine's Day card that still had two Tootsie Roll chocolates(now nearly fossilized) taped inside. My brother had made the card and given itto her when he was in the second grade. There were the black-and-whitemetal-plated photographs of our stern-faced ancestors taken in the late 19thcentury. Apparently, having a personal photo taken a century ago was seriousbusiness. Not one of them was smiling! Then there was my artwork. Mom had all ofit, showing the evolution from the simple drawings of nature I'd made inkindergarten to the Asian watercolors of martial artists I'd painted in highschool. It was those early drawings that bring this story to mind in thischapter.As I unfolded the brittle construction paper and darkened crayon images, I wasamazed by what I was seeing. As I child, I had done my best to reproduce thebeauty of northern Missouri's trees and the changing of the seasons. The thingwas that the drawings on the paper looked nothing like the trees that made upthe forested bluffs overlooking the Missouri River. My trees resembled triangleson skinny poles! The puffy clouds that dotted the sky were empty circles hangingabove the horizon, and the rocks on the ground looked like a pile of tinysquares.What I had recorded on paper was a primitive rendition of what I had actuallyseen with my eyes. What's important here is that I expressed what I'd seen usingthe tools that I'd been taught represent our world: the geometry of shapes.Because the geometry that we've typically learned in the past is based on formsthat we don't find in nature, the drawings were approximations. I'd expressedwhat I'd seen as a child through the shapes with the closest resemblance. Now weknow that this type of geometryEuclidean geometry-simply can't do the job. Thereason is that nature isn't made of circles, triangles, and squares. Clearly, weneed a different kind of geometry to describe the world that we experiencethrough our senses.Now we have one. A new mathematics has burst onto the scene, forever changingthe way we think of everything from nature and our bodies to wars and the stockmarket. It's called fractal mathematics, or simply, fractals.In the 1970s, a mathematics professor at Yale University, Benoit Mandelbrot,developed a way for us to see the underlying structure that makes the world asit is. That structure is made of patterns-specifically, patterns within patternswithin patterns ... and so on. He called his new way of seeing things fractalgeometry. His work The Fractal Geometry of Nature is now recognized as one ofthe most influential books of the 20th century.\"Before Mandelbrot's discovery, mathematicians employed the Euclidean geometrythat I'd used as a child to describe our world. The belief has been that natureis too complex and too fragmented to have a single mathematical form, orformula, that represents it accurately. It's for precisely this reason thatchildren's first drawings of trees usually look like lollipops on sticks. It wasfrom an epiphany that Mandelbrot experienced as an adult studying the world'sarchitecture and the inadequate tools he had to re-create what he saw, that hebegan a search for a new way to express his experiences.Describing this realization, he said, \"I don't feel that Euclid is the way tostart learning mathematics. Learning mathematics should begin by learning thegeometry of mountains, of humans. In a certain sense, the geometry of ... well,of Mother Nature, and also of buildings, of great architecture. 1112With these words, Mandelbrot stated what we all know intuitively. Nature doesnot use perfect lines and curves to build mountains, clouds, and trees. Rather,it uses irregular fragments that, when taken as a whole, become the mountains,clouds, and trees. The key in a fractal is that each fragment, no matter howsmall, looks like the larger pattern that it's a part of. This will be importantwhen we begin to think of time as fractal patterns in the next chapter.When Mandelbrot programmed his simple formula into a computer, the output wasstunning. By depicting everything in the natural world as small fragments thatlook a lot like other small fragments, and by combining these similar fragmentsinto larger patterns, the images that were produced did more than simplyapproximate nature. They looked exactly like nature.[images/00044.jpg]Figure 9. In the 1970s, Benoit Mandelbrot programmed a computer to produce thefirst fractal images, such as the one seen here on the left, called theMandelbrot set. When we zoom in on each piece of the pattern, we find that nomatter what the scale is, the overall pattern repeats itself and looksremarkably self-similar. Scientists have found that self-similar principlesdescribe nature and can mimic even the most complex patterns, such as the fernleaf on the right.This is precisely what Mandelbrot's new geometry was showing us about our world.Nature builds itself in fragments, and each one is made of patterns that aresimilar yet not identical. The term to describe this kind of similarity isself-similarity.Time Code 11: Nature uses a few simple, self-similar, and repeatingpatterns-fractals-to build energy and atoms into the familiar forms ofeverything from roots, rivers, and trees to rocks, mountains, and us.Seemingly overnight, it became possible to use fractals to replicate everythingfrom the coastline of a continent to an alpine forest-and even the universeitself. The key was to find the right formula-the right program. This is theidea that brings us back to thinking of nature as a program that drives theuniverse.[images/00043.jpg]Figure 10. Examples of fractals in nature. The image on the left is of Roma-nesco broccoli. From the individual flowers to the entire stalk, the samepatterns repeat on varying scales to create the head of broccoli. The image onthe top right is of a bolt of electricity discharging as lightning from theatmosphere to the ground. The image below the lightning is of a magnifiedneuron-a specialized cell of the nervous system that carries electricalinformation within the body. Both sets of images illustrate how self-similar,repeating patterns can be used to describe the universe from the very small tothe very large, while differing only in scale.If the entire universe is really the output of an unimaginably huge, ancient,and continuously running program, such as Zuse and Lloyd have suggested, thenthat program must be producing the fractal patterns that we see as the worldaround us. This fractal view of the universe implies that everything from asingle atom to the entire cosmos is made of just a few natural patterns. Whilethey may combine, repeat, and build themselves on larger scales, in theircomplexity they can still be reduced to a few simple forms.The idea is certainly attractive. In fact, it's beautiful. Thinking of theuniverse as a fractal reality crosses the artificial separation that we haveplaced on our knowledge in the past, weaving very different disciplines ofscience and philosophy together into one great, elegant story of how theuniverse is constructed. The fractal view of the cosmos is so complete that iteven accounts for the aesthetic qualities of balance and symmetry that artists,mathematicians, philosophers, and physicists aspire to in the highest forms oftheir crafts.The universal appeal of this way of thinking certainly fulfills pioneeringphysicist John Wheeler's prophetic statement of simplicity's time-tested truth.Before his death in 2008, Wheeler predicted that everything must be based on asimple idea. Once we discover that idea, he said, it would be \"so simple, sobeautiful, so compelling that we will all say to each other, 'Oh, how could ithave been otherwise?\"' A universe of fractal patterns certainly fits Wheeler'sprediction.In addition to accommodating the requirements of so many different ways ofthinking, the fractal model of our universe has another important advantage aswell. It holds the key to unlocking nothing less than the inner workings ofnature's patterns. If we can understand the pattern of an atom on the smallscale, for example, then the fractal pattern of a solar system will begin tomake sense. From our understanding of a solar system, the patterns of a galaxyshould begin to fall into place. While each of these systems is very differentin size, they are expressions of a common pattern; they are fractals of oneanother.Time Code 12: Everything we need to understand the universe lives in thesimplicity of each piece of it.Through his unique gift of finding just the right words to create just the rightmental images, poet William Blake captured the essence of a fractal universe inthe simplicity of only four short verses. Preserved in what may be his mostpopular poem, \"Auguries of Innocence,\" Blake reminds us:[images/00331.jpg]Through the beauty of these words, we're reminded that everything we need inorder to understand the vastness of the universe lives in the simplicity of eachfragment.Nature's Most Beautiful NumberIn January 1986, I walked onto Egypt's Giza plateau for the first time. Toweringinto the sky above me was the marvel that represents one of the greatestunsolved mysteries in the history of our species and the monument that hadfascinated me since the first time I saw an image of it as a child. I wasstanding at the base of the Great Pyramid.It looked different up close, even more weathered and ancient than in theclassic photographs that fill the pages of the travel guides. Although I shouldhave been jet-lagged from the long flights and unexpected delays that it tookfor me to be in the shadow of the pyramid, I felt none of that in the moment.Immediately, I wanted to know more. How could such a mystery remain in thetechnological world of the 20th century? Who put it there? And how?The Great Pyramid is one of those enigmas that seem to be a bottomless pit forquestions. Rather than the traditional process of solving the puzzle bydiscovering facts, the more we know about this ancient mystery, the more wediscover that we don't know. But even in the light of all of the mystery, onefact about Egypt's Great Pyramid has become abundantly clear: Whoever built itunderstood the power of the single number that seems to permeate life and formthroughout the universe. It's the same number that became the focus for one ofthe most successful mystery novels in history.In Dan Brown's best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code, the main character, RobertLangdon, leads his students through the exploration of a powerful number-acode-that the ancients recognized as a constant that exists throughout natureand the universe. Using words that sound more like a reference to a magnificentwork of art than a code to history's greatest secret, Langdon states that thenumber, named phi (usually pronounced with a long i, like the word eye), is\"generally considered the most beautiful number in the universe. 1113While phi may be secretly encoded into the work of great masters such asMichelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, it was certainly no secret to the architectsof the Great Pyramid. The consistent accuracy of the pyramid's constructionleaves little doubt that the numbers and relationships used to build it wereapplied with great care.The Great Pyramid is made of an estimated 2.3 million individually formedstones, some weighing up to 70 tons each. It covers 13 acres of native rock andis nearly perfectly level across the entire area (it's believed that thestructure was once exactly level and that the small variance seen today is dueto shifting earth over the centuries). The pyramid's height is 5,449 inches, thesame number as the average height of the Earth's landmass above sea level, andits location in Egypt is also the geographic center of the landmass for theplanet.With these facts in mind, we can be sure that the use of nature's most beautifulnumber in the pyramid's construction is intentional. It should come as nosurprise, then, that the very dimensions that make this mysterious monumentpossible are due to the use of phi. A line drawn from the projected top (apex)of the capstone to the edge at the base of each face produces a measurement thatis phi units.The ongoing controversy over the age of the Great Pyramid gives suchmeasurements an even greater significance. If the revised date for the buildingof the structure turns out to be older than the conventional theory of 2560B.C., then it means that its builders not only had the advanced knowledge tocreate such a structure, but they also encoded it with the essence of the numberthat seems to govern much of the universe: the mysterious phi.The Mystery of PhiPhi is the number that we get when we compare one part of a \"something\" toanother part of itself, after that something is divided in a very precise way.The result of the comparison is the ratio.While there are an infinite number of ways that something may be divided intotwo parts of different sizes, the one that the universe seems to favor has beenrecognized for hundreds of years. During that time, it's been given names thatvary, from the golden proportion and the divine ratio to the golden ratio.Although the names vary, the number they represent is always the same: Phi withan uppercase P is 1.618; and its close relative, phi with a lowercase p, is.618. Both are a form of the golden ratio. For the following chapters, we willuse phi as .618 for the Time Code calculations.\" The illustration that followsoffers an example of precisely what these ratios are and how they work.[images/00046.jpg]Figure 11. The golden ratio describes a special relationship between two partsof a whole. In this illustration, we can demonstrate this for ourselves bytaking the large section length (A) and dividing it by the smaller section (B).No matter what number we assign to the overall length of the line (C), when wedivide it with the proportions shown above, the relationship of the smallersection to the larger one will always approximate 1.618, while the larger to thesmaller will approximate .618.During the early 14th century, Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician,discovered what is believed to be the never-ending series of numbers thatcreates the golden ratio. The best way to see how this works is to look at anexample. Following are the first 20 members of Fibonacci's numbers, which areknown as the Fibonacci sequence: 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; 89; 144; 233;377; 610; 987; 1,597; 2,584; 4,181; 6,765.. .A closer look at each number will show that it is the result of adding the twonumbers before it. For example, 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; 3+2=5; 5+3=8; and so on.The next thing we see is that if we divide any number in the sequence by the onethat immediately precedes it, the result is close to the golden ratio-veryclose, but never it exactly. The division always gives us a value that is eitherslightly higher or lower, but never equal to, the golden ratio.The reason is that such a division creates a number that falls into a class ofnumbers that simply cannot exist in our way of thinking of numbers. (It's anirrational number, which simply means that it can't be described as an exactfraction.)\" So each number in the sequence dances just above or just below thegolden ratio. The larger the numbers we divide, the tighter the dance and thecloser we get to the precise number of 1.618.Once again, the best way to illustrate how nature approximates the golden ratiois by example. Following are a few showing that the ratio of each pair ofFibonacci's numbers is either slightly higher or slightly lower than the goldenratio itself:[images/00322.jpg]Whether we're talking about the proportions of the human body or those of theelegant temples in ancient Greece, this universal ratio seems to be the templatefor what we accept as beautiful in the world.Fact: The proportions of the human body are governed by the golden ratio:> • Ratio of navel height to total body height is .618.> • Ratio of length of hand to that of forearm is .618.> • Ratio of human face from the brow to the chin is .618 of that from the chin> to the crown.> • The body's ratios continue with additional proportions and even the location> of organs determined by .618.Fact: The orbits of planets, such as Mercury and Venus, are approximated by thegolden ratio.Fact: The spirals that form everything from the arms of the Milky Way galaxy andthe vortices of a hurricane to the way hair grows on the human head and thepattern of seeds in a sunflower are governed by the golden ratio.Fact: The spiral paths traveled by quantum particles in a laboratory bubblechamber are governed by the golden ratio.The golden ratio is everywhere. Because it surrounds us, it's probably noaccident that it embodies the proportions of things that we are most comfortablewith. While the precise reason why things based upon these proportions are sopleasing to us remains a mystery, the fact is that they are. It's almost as ifwe're hardwired to be drawn to such a powerful standard of beauty-and maybe weare.In addition to being the number that governs much of the world around us and theparts of our body that we can see, it's also key for the things we can't see.The golden ratio applies to everything from the brain states of consciousness tothe proportions of DNA itself. For example, one complete turn of a DNA strand is34 (angstrom units) in length and 21 wide. Each of these lengths is a member ofFibonacci's sequence shown previously, and as with the other such numbers, 21 to34 approximates the golden ratio of .618.While we all may know this intuitively, it's important to understand that ouridea of beauty may not be the universal one. If we suddenly find ourselves on analien world someday, with beings that are based upon a different proportion,because we are so powerfully compelled to hold the golden ratio as our standardof beauty they may seem strange and unpleasing to us.At the same time, however, if our alien friends do happen to have bodies basedon a different proportion-say, one that represents half of the golden ratio, of1:309-then we may find that we look just as strange to them as they do to us.Knowing where our ideas of beauty come from may help us be more tolerant ofother possibilities. This simple understanding of our local world could actuallygo a long way in developing good relations in our galactic neighborhood.For reasons so numerous that they've filled entire books in the past, the goldenratio seems to be the guiding principle in nature's cycles of growth andproportion, as well as in the timing that separates the things that happen inlife.It's precisely because the golden ratio applies to the natural world in a waythat is so universal that we shouldn't be surprised to find that it applies tothe mysterious essence separating one moment of life from the next. The goldenratio applies to time itself.The Mystery of TimeWhen physicist John Wheeler was once asked to define \"time,\" he did so with asimplicity that we might expect from an ancient mystic isolated in a remotemonastery at the summit of a snowpacked mountain in the Himalayas. \"Time,\" hesaid, \"is what prevents everything from happening at once.\" While we may laughwhen we first hear such a simple answer from such a brilliant man, if we reallythink about it, it is clear that Wheeler had a deep understanding of what may bethe most common yet mysterious relationship that each of us will experience inlife-our relationship with the time that defines our existence.Our bizarre relationship with time, as well as our attempts to describe it, isnothing new. In words that are as meaningful today as they were in his time,Saint Augustine identified the irony of our relationship with time. \"What istime?\" he began. \"If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain itto him who asks, I do not know.\" Sixteen hundred years ago, Saint Augustineseems to have zeroed in on the crux of time's mystery.Without a doubt, time is the most elusive experience to define and the mostdifficult to explain. The reason is that no one has ever seen it, measured itdirectly, or experienced it by itself. We can't capture it or photograph it.Contrary to what \"daylight saving time\" seems to suggest, it's impossible tocollect it in one place and use it later somewhere else. When we do try todescribe what time means in our lives, we find that the only way to do so is todescribe our experiences within time, rather than the time itself. We say thatsomething happened then in the past, that it's happening now in the present, orthat it will happen at some point in the future.In other words, it's as if time cannot be separated from the events themselves.This is precisely the key to what may well be one of humankind's greatest leapsin understanding the way the universe works: the fact that time and the thingsthat happen within it are intimately connected as two parts of the sameessence-they cannot be separated.Two revolutionary discoveries of the 20th century forever changed the way wethink of time. With those discoveries, it became possible to link time with thethings that happen within it. In other words, it became scientifically \"legal\"for us to think of time as stuff. If it behaves like stuff, then we can measureit as stuff.Because time is a natural process and so much of nature is governed by thegolden ratio, it would make sense that time would follow the same patterns offractals and the golden ratio as well. And it does. To understand how thisparadigm-shattering way of thinking connects the things that happen in thefuture with those of the past, we must first take a closer look at the mysteryof time itself.Space and Time ReduxUntil the 20th century, the Western world typically thought of time in a poeticsense, as something that exists only because we need it to exist in ourexperience. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described time as \"a special kind ofseparation\" between the events of life. It's this separation that creates whathe called a \"division that reunites.\"The Greek philosophers were among the first who tried to give a definition totime. In his work Timaeus, for example, Plato describes how time was createdalong with the heavens for a specific reason. \"[The Creator] sought to make theuniverse eternal, so far as might be,\" he begins. But recognizing that the lifewithin the universe would not share the eternal attribute of the universe, Platoreasoned that the Creator \"resolved to have a moving image of eternity, and whenhe set in order the heavens, he made this image eternal but moving according tonumber, while eternity itself rests in unity; and this image we call time. 1116From this description, we see that Plato believed time originated with the birthof the universe and was God's way of assuring a lasting creation.With the birth of science in the 17th century, time began to take on a newmeaning. When Isaac Newton formalized the laws of motion in 1687, he recognizedthat his theories, as well as his equations, were based upon time. So toidentify the nature of the stuff that his work depended on, he defined pure timeas something that \"flows equably without relation to anything external.\"\"In other words, Newton thought of time as an absolute quantity. It \"is\" what it\"is\" and isn't influenced by the universe or events of the world. This view oftime works as if there were an independent clock ticking away somewhere outsideof the universe tirelessly tracking the constant flow of time. Newton's ideaswere accepted quickly because they seemed to work well-so well, in fact, that hedeveloped calculus, an entire mathematical system based upon his notions oftime.The implications of Newton's view of time as an absolute quantity are still withus today. If his ideas are correct, then it means that we should be able tocalculate the location of every particle in the universe. And if we could knowwhere each particle is and how fast it's moving, then we should be able tocalculate its precise location at another moment in time.With the acceptance of Newton's ideas, the whole universe began to look like abig machine made of particles that could be tracked from one place to another.It's this mechanical view of reality and our bodies that has led to thepresent-day split between thinking of our world as individual particles that canbe known and measured absolutely (classical physics) and conceptualizing it aszones of energy described by probabilities (quantum physics).With Einstein's theory of relativity in 1905, these poetic views changedforever. Rather than thinking of time as its own experience and separate fromeverything else, Einstein suggested something so radical that even scientistshad to rethink the foundation of physics to grasp what he was saying. The bottomline of Einstein's theory was simply this: time is part of the universe andcannot be separated from the space it travels in.In other words, time and space are two parts of the same stuff. And just the waytwo threads become intimately enmeshed in the same strand of yarn, time cannotbe separated from the space it moves through. It is space and time, marriedtogether as spacetime, Einstein said, that forms a realm beyond our familiarworld of three dimensions of length, width, and height. He called this realm thefourth dimension. With the acceptance of Einstein's ideas, time became more thana casual philosophical concept. Suddenly, it was a force of nature thatscientists had to seriously deal with.[images/00045.jpg]Figure 12. What does space-time look like? Scientists often illustrate itthrough images that look like the one above, where the waves of space are bentand shaped by things like black holes and the gravity of planets. Because timeand the events of life cannot be separated, however, in reality we seespace-time all around us as our everyday world. From the waves of the ocean tothe person sitting next to you, all that we know as our world is the space-timeof the universe frozen into the \"now\" of the present moment.While Einstein is credited with the publication of the theory of relativity, theidea of time and space woven together actually arose from one of his colleaguesand friends, Hermann Minkowski. It was Minkowski's elaboration upon Einstein'sideas that he described at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists andPhysicians in 1908. Minkowski began the program with the following nowfamouswords:> The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from> the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are> radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade> away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an> independent reality.\"Acknowledging that both Einstein's relativity and Minkowski's revisions led toone of the most revolutionary ideas in science, the complete term for the realmthat Minkowski was describing is now known as Einstein-Minkowski space-time.Einstein knew that what he had proposed in his original papers of relativity wascomplex. In a letter to Heinrich Zangger in 1915, he stated: \"The theory isbeautiful beyond comparison. However, only one colleague has really been able tounderstand it and [use it].\"19 (That colleague was mathematician David Hilbert.)Once the idea of relativity caught on, however, there was no turning back.Suddenly everyone seemed to be talking about it, and more than 30 years laterEinstein was still baffled by why his ideas of space and time were received sowell by the public at large.In a letter to Philipp Frank, for example, in 1942, Einstein wrote: \"I neverunderstood why the theory of relativity ... should have met with such a lively,indeed passionate, reception among a broad segment of the public.\" In anotherletter to his friend and colleague Marcel Grossmann, Einstein described just howmuch his ideas of relativity had permeated the public at large: \"At presentevery coachman and every waiter argues about whether or not relativity theory iscorrect. 1120In words that gave an entirely new meaning to our idea of time, Einsteindescribed its mysterious nature, explaining, \"Time cannot be absolutely defined,and there is an inseparable relation between time and signal velocity [speed ofa wave].\"21 With this single sentence, 300 years of the way we think of time andthe things that happen within time changed forever. We continue to talk aboutthe implications today, and many of the questions that were sparked byEinstein's ideas still have not been answered.The \"Problem\" of TimePerhaps the two questions of time that baffle scientists the most are thefollowing:> 1. Is time real?> 2. Why does time seem to flow only in one directionforward?While these two questions may sound like something we'd expect to hear on thefirst day of a college philosophy course, the answers are the key to the meaningof the Mayan calendar and the mystery of 2012. Mainstream scientists areseriously asking both. The reason is that they must be answered beforescientists can move on and solve some of the greatest mysteries of physics andthe universe.The effort is paying off. Recent studies are producing new evidence that hascatapulted physicists into a new way of thinking of the universe. This new wayof thinking is leading to precisely what we need to solve the mystery of 2012.So let's take a deeper look at each question and see where the evidence leads.1. Is Time Real?If we ask anyone who is stuck in traffic on one of America's gridlocked freewaysif time is real, the answer will be the same. Most will find a directcorrelation between the level of their blood pressure and the time of theircommute. Their answer would be: \"Yes! You bet, time is real.\" And, from thequantum perspective of creating our reality in terms of the way we perceive ourworld, they are absolutely right.Time is as real as we agree it is. But while \"watch time\" ticks away the minutesit takes us to get from one stoplight to the next, maybe there's another kindwe're also dealing with: the time that is the container for the things happeningin the world. While he did not have the rush-hour traffic to contend with whilehe was asking this question, this is precisely the kind of time that Einsteinchose to see differently a century ago. When he did, everything changed.While Einstein's 1905 and 1915 theories of relativity definitely propelled usinto a new way of thinking of time, they also created a problem that physicistsare still struggling with today. Here's the bottom line to the quandary: therules that describe the world on the large scale of universes and apples fallingfrom trees (classical physics) do not seem to work with the rules that describethe tiny realm of subatomic particles that the apples and universes are made of(quantum physics). It's all about what time means to us in our reality. Its rolehas been in question for so long that physicists even have their own lingo todescribe the mystery ... it's simply called \"the problem of time.\"In 1967, two of the 20th century's most brilliant minds proposed a way to unifythe quantum and classical worlds. Physicists John Wheeler (a PrincetonUniversity colleague and peer of Einstein) and Bryce DeWitt (of the Universityof North Carolina) published a paper with an equation that seemed tosuccessfully merge both ways of thinking of the world into a single unified viewknown as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.22 For those trying to reconcile the twogreat theories of physics, this appeared to be great news.While the specifics of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are complex, the idea issimple. It's a way to think of the universe from a perspective that weaves thequantum world and classical physics into a single story. There is one small\"catch,\" however: to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we have to forget abouttime. That's rightit seems that in arriving at the solution, time simplydisappears from the equation.In other words, just when it seems that a couple of the best minds of the 20thcentury have solved one of the greatest mysteries in the history of science, wefind that the only way for them to do so is to discount the very essence of thestuff that keeps everything from happening all at once. So just what is such adiscovery really telling us? Could it be that at the deepest levels of reality,time doesn't truly exist?This is precisely the conclusion that studies at Germany's Max Planck Instituteof Quantum Optics seem to be leading to. It's there that physicist Ferenc Krauszhas been using laser light to explore the tiniest intervals of time imaginable:quantum time. His work has taken him to a place that sounds more like afairytale world of imagination than the reality of a laboratory experiment. InKrausz's lab, the things that happen during the study occur so quickly, and onsuch a small scale, that scientists have had to create a whole new vocabularyjust to describe them.An attosecond, for example, is a measure of time that's equal toone-quintillionth of a second. That is the number 1 followed by 18 zeros. It'sin these mind-bogglingly tiny instants of time that scientists have discovered aplace where there is no time, a realm where the space between one thinghappening and the next has no meaning and makes no sense. It's called Plancktime. Planck time is measured as anything that happens in an interval of 10-43seconds or less (that's minus 10 with 43 zeros after it). Just for scale, oneunit of Planck time is less than a trillionth of a trillionth of the attoseconddescribed above! At least for now, it is the smallest unit of time that has anymeaning in the physical world.This brings us back to the reality of time itself and what happens at intervalsthat are less than Planck time. The bottom line is this-for things that happenbelow the Planck scale, time disappears. In other words, the things that happenat such small scales appear to have no meaning in our physical world. This hasled to the controversial idea that time may not be as important as we oncethought it was, or it may be that it doesn't exist in the way we've thought ofit in the past. Carlo Rovelli, a physicist at the University of theMediterranean in Marseille, France, sums up this possibility: \"It may be thatthe best way to think about quantum reality is to give up the notion oftime-that the fundamental description of the universe must be timeless.\"23With these words Rovelli describes just how far we have come in our thinking ofwhat time means to us. While we used to think of it as the basis of life and theuniverse, we may be discovering that time, at least in some places, doesn't evenmatter. We now have everything we need to address the question that began thissection: does time really exist, or is it our experience that gives it meaning?Interestingly, the answer to both parts of the question appears to be the same.It's yes. It all depends upon what level of reality we're talking about and ourplace in that reality.When \"Then\" Is \"Now\": The Language That Mirrors RealityWhile modern science is still coming to terms with the reality of time and whatit means for the concepts of past and future, our indigenous ancestors werealready well aware of these relationships. When linguist Benjamin Lee Whorfexplored the language of the Hopi during the mid-20th century, for example, hediscovered that their words directly reflected their view of the timeless natureof the universe. Their idea of time and our place in it was very different fromthe way we typically think of ourselves. They saw the world as a single entity,with everything connected and happening in the present of \"now.\"In his pioneering book Language, Thought, and Reality, Whorf summarized the Hopiworldview: \"In [the] Hopi view, time disappears and space is altered, so that itis no longer the homogeneous and instantaneous timeless space of our supposedintuition or of classical Newtonian mechanics.\"24 In other words, the Hopisimply don't think of time, space, distance, and reality in the way we do. Intheir eyes, we live in a universe where everything is alive and connected.Perhaps most important, they see everything as happening \"now.\" Their languagemirrors their view.When we look at an ocean, for example, and see a wave, we would typically say,\"Look at that wave.\" But we know that in reality, the wave we're looking atdoesn't exist alone. It's there only because of other waves. \"Without theprojection of language,\" said Wharf, \"no one ever saw a single wave.\"25 What wesee is a \"surface in everchanging undulating motions,\" he explained. In thelanguage of the Hopi, however, they would say that the ocean is \"waving\" todescribe the action of the water in the moment they see it. More precisely,clarified Whorf, \"Hopi say walalata, `plural waving occurs,' and can callattention to one place in the waving just as we can.\"26 In this way, although itmay sound odd to us, they are actually more accurate in how they describe theworld.In this expanded view of the universe, time as we tend to think of it takes on abrand-new meaning within the traditional beliefs of the Hopi. Whorf's studiesled him to discover that the \"manifested comprises all that is or has beenaccessible to the senses, the historical physical universe ... with no attemptto distinguish between present and past, but excluding everything that we callfuture. \"27In other words, the Hopi language uses the same words whether describing what\"is\" or what has already happened. Knowing that the quantum world holds theblueprint of all possibilities, this view of time and language makes perfectsense. When the Hopi say that something \"is,\" they are describing the quantumpossibility that has become manifest, while also leaving the future open toother possibilities.From the implications of the Hopi language to the nowcommon laboratory examplesproving that observation affects reality, it's obvious that there is more to ourrelationship with time than using it to gauge when we are at the right place atthe right moment of the day. While it may not exist in the unseen quantum world,time definitely exists in the world of big things like universes, patterns, andcycles. Where there's time, it seems to always flow in the same direction. Thisleads us to our second mystery.While the mathematics describing time appear to allow for it to move eitherforward or backward, our everyday world seems to be locked into a place where weexperience only the future motion physicists refer to as the forward \"arow oftime.\"2. Why Does Time Seem to Flow Only in One Direction?When physicists talk about time, their ideas generally follow one of two ways ofthinking. One way says that time is a subjective experience and that the way weexperience it is determined by whoever is doing the experiencing. From thisperspective, the past, present, and future all exist, all of the time. In everymoment, they each exist as a flow of energy and events that we experience as\"now.\"Perhaps this way of thinking of time is best described by Einstein himself in aletter sometime around 1931. \"For those of us who believe in physics,\" he said,\"this separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion, althougha persistent one.\"28 While many physicists believe that our \"illusion\" of timemay be the way the universe really works, when it comes to the mathematics thatdescribe time, there's a mystery that seems to be as persistent as the illusionitself. It's called the arrow of time or, more commonly, the \"problem of time.\"Simply stated, the problem is this: Time seems to flow only in one direction. Itmoves from the present to the future. While there is nothing in physics thatsays time must go in one direction, we all know that it does. Or at least that'sthe way it seems to us. Any doubt of this fact quickly disappears when we thinkof the way things work in our everyday world.If an egg slips from our fingers and shatters onto the kitchen floor, forexample, while we're rushing around to make breakfast in the morning, that eggis pretty much irreversibly broken. And we can safely assume that it will remainthat way forever. The possibility that the fragmented, shattered shell willreassemble itself into the familiar shape of the original egg, coupled with thepossibility that the yolk spread across the floor will suddenly gather itselfback into a round mass that was neatly packed inside of the shell, is slim.What makes this so interesting, however, is that there is nothing in ourunderstanding that prevents these things from happening. Just to be clear,there's absolutely nothing in the laws of physics, at least as we know themtoday, that states that the egg must remain broken forever. In fact, the physicssuggest just the opposite: the principles that determine the flow of time in theuniverse are said to be symmetrical-that is, they can go in either direction.But we know that they don't. All we have to do is to think about that shatteredegg on the kitchen floor, the flow of money from our checkbook, or the way wechange as we age to be a firsthand witness to the arrow of time. The question iswhy? What is it that seems to force time to flow in one direction, and why isthat direction always toward the future?The answer to this question is the second key to understanding the mystery of2012. It all comes back to Einstein's brilliant realization that time and spaceare inseparable.For the most part, the prevailing view of the way things began in the universeis encapsulated as part of what is called the big bang theory. Simply stated,the big bang proposes that a primal release of energy set the universe intomotion. While there is controversy as to precisely when this event happened andwhat, if anything, existed before it, the data strongly suggest that it did takeplace. Recent information from satellites, such as NASA's Chandra Observatoryand the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), shows what are believed to be theremains of the massive release of energy that birthed our universe about 14billion years ago.29 What's important here is that the energy appears to bemoving away from one place in the center of the universe. As it does, the datashow that it is expanding and cooling.[images/00038.jpg]Figure 13. Left: NASA image from the COBE satellite showing the concentration ofenergy left over from the original release of the big bang. Right: Artist'sillustration showing the energy of the universe expanding outward and movingaway from a central point. Because time and the space it travels in cannot beseparated, the outward and ongoing expansion of the universe may explain themystery of why time appears to move only in one direction and always toward thefuture.It's in the outward expansion of the universe from a central point that we mayfind the clue to time's mysterious flow in one direction. Just as our egg on thekitchen floor does not reverse the sequence of events that led to itsshattering, the universe does not reverse the flow of the outward expansion thatbegan with the big bang-or at least not in the current cycle of the universe aswe know it. Because time is the space it travels in, it expands with the flow ofspace: outward and away from its source.So while the laws of physics may allow time to move either forward orbackward-to the future or the past-it's the outward flow of the universe itselfthat makes its arrow march in one direction. With this idea in mind, what wouldhappen to time if the universe stopped expanding and began to shrink? Would itstart to move in the opposite direction and become \"smaller\"? This is preciselywhat the traditional Hindu texts suggest is our ultimate fate.In the creation story of the Puranas, the existence of the universe isattributed to the inhalation and exhalation of Brahma's breath. Similar to theway scientists describe the big bang as the release of energy that began theuniverse, the ancient myth traces the beginning of the universe to the releaseof energy from the god's exhaling breath. As long as Brahma continues to breatheoutward, the universe continues to grow and expand.Furthermore, just as scientific theories identify a time when the forces ofgravity and electromagnetism will reach a balance, stop expanding, and begin tocontract, the Hindu texts describe a moment when Brahma completes his exhale,pauses, and begins the next part of his breath as an inhale. If space-time trulyexists in the way that relativity describes it today, then during this period wewould experience time in a very different way than we do now. This is wherethings get even more interesting.According to the current theories, the contraction of the universe would causespace to flow in the opposite direction from what we see today. In other words,all of the particles that have moved away from the place where the big bangoriginated would begin a journey backward toward their point of origin. Becausespace is time, time would reverse its flow as well.So we may well discover that the reason time seems to move only toward thefuture is simply that it's following the movement of space. If we ever findourselves in a place where space is contracting, such as a wormhole or hiddendimensions, the mathematics that we know today would still apply, only in theopposite direction.The Shape of TimeBecause space and time are different parts of the same stuff, and \"stuff\" hasform, the question that comes to mind when we think of time as a wave is: Whatdoes it look like? What is the shape of time? While it may take a second or twoto really wrap our minds around the possibility that time can take on a form,it's certainly not a new idea. In fact, it's precisely the conclusion that someopen-minded and far-thinking scientists arrived at early in the last century.In 1913, the mathematician Elie Joseph Cartan (1869-1951) proposed a new kind ofmathematics that would explain some of the mysteries of space-time thatEinstein's relativity theories couldn't account for. The result was theEinstein-Cartan theory describing space-time as something that moves in aspecial way and follows a special path, which creates a special effect. The pathis that of a spiral, and the effect is called a torsion field .30Thinking of the stuff that the universe is made of in terms of a torsion fieldcarries a number of profound implications. Perhaps the most obvious is that theshape of space-time is the template for the way matter forms in nature. We don'tneed to look far to find evidence that this is precisely the case. We seenature's spirals everywhere. In fact, they seem to be the pattern for much ofthe universe as we know it. If we begin with big things, like galaxies, and workour way down to the tiniest that cannot be seen with the naked eye, it becomesclear that spirals of space-time are key to nature's code.Here is a brief listing of just how universal this form is and how frequently itappears in our world and beyond:> • The spiral that governs the shape of the Milky Way and other \"spiral\"> galaxies> • The spiral orbits of the planets as they revolve around the sun> • The spiral patterns of the weather systems that move across the face of the> earth> • The spiral vortex that drains the water in our sink one direction in the> Northern Hemisphere and the opposite way in the Southern Hemisphere> • The spiral winds that form the familiar funnel shape of hurricanes,> tornados, and dust devils> • The spiral configuration of the seeds that grow in the head of flowers such> as the sunflower> • The spiral patterns that form the protective coverings we see as the> beautiful shells we find on a beach> • The spiral pattern that defines much of the human bodyAnd the list goes on and on.While we may not put a lot of time into thinking about the role of spirals innature, visionary naturalists, such as Theodor Schwenk (1910-1986) and ViktorSchauberger (1885-1958), have dedicated their lives to doing just that. Throughthe legacy of their unifying studies, we have clear documentation of the rolethat spiral energy plays in everything from the motion of water in Earth'sstreams and rivers to the motion of the blood that courses through our veins togive us life. It's precisely because the spiral pattern and torsion effectappear to be so universal that it makes perfect sense to find this powerfulshape in the stuff that the universe is made of, as well.It's this very idea that brings us back to nature's most beautiful number. Thespiral that we see so commonly in the world is actually a special kind that ismade from the numbers we explored previously as the Fibonacci sequence. It'scalled a Fibonacci spiral. So the beautiful number phi that determines how oftenthings in nature repeat also appears to govern the very shape of the stuff(space-time) that those patterns are filling.So now we can answer the question that began this section: what is the shape oftime? The evidence of spirals in energy and nature suggests that the waves oftime follow the paths of those spirals. As they do, they create the torsionfields that move in cycles throughout the universe. With these ideas in mind, itnow makes even more sense to think of the things that happen in life and theworld as places appearing along time's ever-expanding spirals. Whether we'retalking about that time in terms of seconds, years, or eons, those places can bemeasured, calculated, and even predicted.Armed with our understanding of time's shape (spiral) and motion (outward),let's apply what we know to the everyday world. We've all heard that historyrepeats itself, but what does that really mean? How much of history repeats, andcan we know when a bad experience from our past (or a good one, for that matter)is likely to show up again in our lives?In the next chapter we'll use the simplicity of nature's programs to answerthese questions. If we know where we are in the spiral of time, then we candiscover the seed event that begins a cycle and determine when the personal andglobal conditions of the past will show up again in our future.[images/00047.jpg][images/00048.jpg]\"There are cycles in everything. There are cycles in the weather, the economy,the sun, wars, geological formations, atomic vibrations, climate, human moods,the motions of the planets, populations of animals, the occurrence of diseases,the prices of commodities and shares and the large scale structure of theuniverse.\"- Ray Tomes, contemporary philosopher\"The eternal flow of time goes through cyclical periods of manifestation of theuniverse ... \"- Alexander Friedman (1888-1925), cosmologistThe look on my teacher's face that day is something I'll always remember. Shewas obviously shaken as she walked into our classroom and asked us to remaincalm, collect our coats and supplies, and walk quickly to the buses that werewaiting for us outside. It was the middle of the day and much too early forclasses to end. I remember thinking that our teacher knew something she wasn'ttelling us. Why else would she be wiping tears from her eyes while asking us tostay calm?It was a different world in 1963. The Cold War between the Soviet Union and theU.S. was at its peak. The frightening image broadcast around the world of Sovietleader Nikita Khrushchev holding his shoe and pounding it against a desk whileshouting to America, \"We will bury you!\" was still fresh in my memory. Iremember thinking of it each week as our class practiced dropping to our kneesand ducking under our desks to protect ourselves in the event of a surpriseatomic attack. I also remember thinking that if we were ever actually bombed, mydesk probably wouldn't be much protection from the force of an atomic blast!Only a year earlier, in October 1962, everyone had breathed a sigh of relief asthe two superpowers backed away from one of the Cold War's most visibleconfrontations and the brink of nuclear war-the Cuban missile crisis. The girlin the seat next to me remembered it, too, and whispered that maybe the missileswere \"back.\" We all knew that something had happened. We just didn't know what.It's with the backdrop of such a world that I joined hundreds of thousands ofother children across the country who left school early that day. It wasNovember 22, 1963.As we filed toward the only door leading out of the classroom, the last thing Iheard was my teacher's voice attempting to provide some kind of explanation.\"Your parents will have to tell you what has happened,\" she said. \"We're notallowed to do so in school.\" And just like that, I walked with my classmates toour buses with absolutely no indication of when, or even if, we would return.When I arrived home, our family living room was like a replay of what I hadexperienced at school. My mother's eyes were red from crying, and she wasobviously frightened. \"Here, take a look at the television,\" she said. Togetherwe watched our family's tiny black-and-white TV as the unthinkable unfolded.Each station was showing the same images, with the same story: the President ofthe United States had been assassinated. The nation was in shock. There were somany unanswered questions. Who did it? Why? How could such a thing havehappened?Deja Vu, 100 Years LaterJust a couple of days after John F. Kennedy's assassination, our local newspaperprinted a story that rekindled my fascination with patterns. While I was movedby the life, ambition, and vision of Kennedy himself, the story was about thecurious circumstances that surrounded his death. I read it and reread it. Thetitle of the article was \"History Repeats Itself.\" Its focus was on the eerieset of \"coincidences\" that connect the 1963 assassination of President Kennedyto another that had occurred nearly 100 years beforethat of Abraham Lincoln.While I had always been interested in patterns and cycles, I had never reallythought of them in terms of things like the deaths of Presidents.At first I simply skimmed the statistics out of curiosity. While they wereinteresting, they seemed so generalized that I was unconvinced that there wasany great mystery. My thought was that any similarities were just that:parallels that the staff writers were drawing to create a flashy story. BothPresidents, for example, had been deeply involved with racial equality and civilrights. Both had wives who had lost children while living in the White House.Both had been shot on a Friday. Both had died from a gunshot wound to the head.All were certainly uncanny coincidences, but not enough to convince me thatanything out of the ordinary was being revealed. The more I read, however, themore specific and bizarre the parallels became.Lincoln, for example, was sitting in box number 7 of Ford's Theatre when he waskilled. Kennedy was riding in car number 7 -the make was a Lincoln offered bythe Ford Motor Companywhen he died. Both were with their wives at the time.Before his presidency, Lincoln had been elected to Congress in 1846. One hundredyears later, in 1946, Kennedy was elected to Congress. Lincoln became Presidentin 1860, Kennedy 100 years later in 1960. The last name of the men who replacedthem in office was the same Johnson-and both Johnsons were born 100 years apart.Andrew Johnson was born in 1808, while Lyndon Johnson was born in 1908.As the comparisons continued, the similarities certainly seemed to be more thancoincidence. They even went beyond the assassinations themselves, weaving theirway throughout the personal lives of the men, their families, and their friends.Both Presidents had four children, and both had lost two of them before theyreached their teens. Both had lost a son while they were serving in the WhiteHouse. The doctors for Lincoln and Kennedy had the same name: Charles Taft. Thename of Lincoln's private secretary was John (Kennedy's first name), and that ofKennedy's secretary was Lincoln (Abraham's last name).The patterns even extended into the lives of the men who killed them-into theirpersonal histories, their motivations, and their captures. A law-enforcementagent named Baker, for example, detained Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth.An officer who was also named Baker held Kennedy's shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald,in custody.It seemed that the patterns were endless. But perhaps more important, they areundeniable. Regardless of why or how these two events separated by 100 yearscould be so similar, the fact is that they are. While this example could bechalked up to some sort of bizarre karma between these two men, the reality isthat it exists. Whether we like to admit the similarities or not, the answer toour question of whether or not history repeats itself appears obvious. For atleast these two events, it appears to be yes.Along with our answer comes an even deeper question: Are the similarities thatwe see between the assassinations of two American Presidents separated by 100years part of a greater pattern? If so, what is the pattern, and what does ittell us about the cyclic nature of time?The 20-Year \"Curse\"In the same way we search for patterns to find meaning in the mysterious eventsof our day, scholars do the same thing with historic moments of the past.Following the tragic death of President Lincoln in the 1860s, for example,historians began to suspect that his assassination might be part of a patternthat was emerging. Little more than 20 years earlier, another President hadtragically died in office. In 1841, William Henry Harrison had become ill anddied of pneumonia.With President Harrison's death, it seemed that the seed had been planted for apattern of such tragedies. In the years that have followed, the suspicions ofthose early scholars have been confirmed. For reasons that are as eerie as theyare mysterious, in the nearly 160 years that followed Harrison's deathapproximately every 20 years the U.S. President has either died in office or hassurvived an attempt on his life (see Figure 14).With the unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush,the conditions of the pattern seem to have held true. The question thathistorians are now asking is whether or not their survival after theseassassination attempts has put an end to the \"20-year curse\" of AmericanPresidents. The presidential cycle of 2020 will tell the story. When we look atthe statistics, however, they seem to speak for themselves.[images/00326.jpg]Figure 14. Since the election of the United States President in 1840, thecountry has lost a sitting President to illness or violence every 20 years. (Theelection years given for McKinley and Roosevelt are for reelections.)Whether we're talking about the 100-year coincidences between Kennedy andLincoln or the 20-year presidential \"curse,\" three facts are obvious:Fact 1: There are cycles underlying both events.Fact 2: Both cycles are \"triggered\" by a seed event.Fact 3: The conditions of the seed event repeat at regular intervals.The facts are undeniable. The question for us is, what do they mean? What aresuch obvious cycles telling us about the nature of our lives, our world, andeven time itself?We may find that the message encoded into a 3,000-year-old manuscript holds theanswer. But, as is so often the case, with it we open the door to an evengreater mystery.The 3,000-Year-Old Map of TimeIn November 1995, Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel, was assassinatedin the city of Tel Aviv. While the event itself shocked the world, there was anaspect of Rabin's assassination that rumbled like an earthquake through thescientific community, with aftershocks that continue to this day. Before the dayof his death, Rabin had been warned that he was the target of an assassin. Whatmade the warning so unusual, however, was that it didn't come from a secretinformer or as a result of a detective's work-at least not one working in lawenforcement. Instead, the information regarding Rabin's death was based upon aprophetic code discovered in a document created more than 3,000 years ago: theBible.'Specifically, the researchers who had warned Rabin had discovered the details ofhis death in a particular portion of the Bible. The first five books of theChristian Old Testament are the same mysterious five books that form the HebrewTorah, one of the stablest documents in human history. A comparison of today'sTorah with the oldest known versions shows that it has not undergone the editsand revisions of other sections of the Bible. In fact, only about 23 lettershave changed in 1,000 years.So when we study the Torah, we can trust that we are reading the original text,just as it was intended more than 30 centuries ago. It's for this very reasonthat Rabin followed the schedule on the day he was killed. He was a deeplyspiritual man and believed in the Torah so much that he felt that if his lastday on Earth was truly encoded into such an ancient and holy text, then theevents of that day must be destined to occur. On November 4, they did.It is within the Torah, and only the Torah, that Israeli mathematician EliyahuRips, Ph.D., discovered \"the Bible Code,\" which has been reviewed and validatedby scientists in leading universities worldwide, as well as technical agenciesthat specialize in encryption decoding, such as the U.S. Department of Defense.Rips and Michael Drosnin, the journalist who wrote the first book describing thecode, uncovered details that they shared with Rabin. The Bible Code describedthe specifics of the event and did so with such accuracy that there could be nodoubt as to what was being revealed.The prime minister's name, Rabin, had been spelled out, along with the date ofthe assassination, the name of the city it would occur within, and even theassassin's name: Amir.2In some ancient and mysterious way, the details of theevent that changed the course of history for Israel had been encoded into thefabric of the most beloved book in the world, a text that appeared upon theearth more than 1,000 years before the time of Jesus.The Code Within the CodeFor more than 200 years, scholars have suspected that the Torah holds more thanthe words that are read sequentially on each page. An 18th-century scholar knownas the Genius of Vilna once stated: \"The rule is that all that was, is, and willbe unto the end of time is included in the Torah, from the first word to thelast word. And not merely in a general sense, but as to the details of ...everything that happened to him from the day of his birth until his end. \"3Mathematicians study the Torah's encrypted messages of time, past and future, bycreating a matrix from the letters of the Bible's first five books: Genesis,Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Beginning with the first letter ofthe first word, all spaces and punctuation are removed until the last letter ofthe last word is reached, leaving a single sentence thousands of characters inlength.Using sophisticated search programs, the matrix of letters is examined forpatterns and intersecting words. In the book of Genesis, for example, the wordTorah is actually spelled out with sequences of 50 characters between eachletter of the word. The same sequence is found in the books of Exodus, Numbers,and Deuteronomy. Only in Leviticus is the code absent, for mysterious reasonsthat may unlock an even greater secret within it. As early as the 1940s, RabbiM. D. Weissmandel found these sequences, and the word Torah became the key tounraveling the code within the code of the text.With the development of high-speed computers, the extent of the Bible Code wasfinally recognized. The new computers replaced the tedious manual decoding thathad driven Bible scholars to madness for centuries. Running against controlgroups of other texts, such as War and Peace, Moby-Dick, and even the YellowPages telephone directories, only the Bible was found to have the encodedmessages. According to Harold Gans, a former code breaker with the U.S. NationalSecurity Agency (NSA), there is about a 1-in-200,000 chance that the informationrevealed in the Bible Code is a coincidence. Vertically, horizontally, anddiagonally, the names of countries, events, dates, times, and people intersectwith one another in a way that sets the Bible apart from any other text, givingus a snapshot into the events of our past and a window into our future.While the reasons why such an ancient prediction tool could see into 3,000 yearsof time so accurately remain a mystery, the big question is, how does it relateto our future? In light of its accuracy for events ranging from World War II,the Shoemaker-Levy comet impact with Jupiter, the Scud missiles discoveredduring the first Gulf War in Iraq, and the Kennedy assassination, how reliablecan this ancient matrix be when peering into the years to come?In answer to this question, Dr. Rips suggests that the entire Bible Code had tobe written all at once, as a single act, rather than developing over time. Theimplication of such a statement is mind-boggling. It means that when the Torahwas transcribed, all possibilities and all possible futures already existed andwere already in place. \"We experience it like we experience a hologram,\" hesuggests. \"It looks different when we look at it from a new angle-but the image,of course, is pre-recorded.\"4 The key to applying this ancient Time Code tofuture events may lie in thinking of it through the eyes of what we now knowabout cycles of time.Planting the Seeds of TimeWhether we're talking about world ages that last for 5,125 years at a time orthe link between the events of 1941, 1984, and 2001, it's clear that cycles areinvolved and that each has a beginning. In every instance, that beginning-theseed event-sets the conditions that will repeat at various future dates. Fromour understanding of natural rhythms and cycles, we can calculate when similarconditions and events will repeat throughout the cycles of time.So here's the question: Is it possible that everything from the war and peacebetween nations to the love and heartbreaks of life began with a seed eventsomewhere in our distant past? In other words, are we living out a pattern thatwas initiated with the beginning of time-the beginning of our cycle in 3114s.c.-and will complete with the end of the cycle in A.D. 2012? If so, is theBible Code the \"map\" that describes the cycles, as well as the seed events thatset into motion all the human dramas playing out across our world today?Admittedly, these are huge questions and deserve more attention than we can dojustice to in this book alone. But the ideas are worth considering and may go along way to help explain the mystery of the Bible Code and what the Torah isreally telling us about our future. Whether or not we actually believe in theliteral accuracy of this sacred book is less important than our understanding ofthe themes it describes.In the fourth chapter of Genesis, for example, the Torah \"time map\" describesthe first betrayal of one human by another, the violence of brother againstbrother when Cain took the life of Abel. From the perspective of repeatingpatterns and cycles, we can think of this primal act of betrayal as the seedevent that anchors the repeating pattern of betrayal throughout the history ofall remaining cycles.Not long after this original betrayal, in the same chapter we also find thefirst acts of forgiveness. Among them is the story of Joseph, who was one of 11brothers. As Joseph was his father Jacob's favored son, his brothers becamejealous and sold Joseph into slavery. In the second confrontation betweenbrothers in Genesis, this story has a different outcome from the first, that ofCain and Abel. The powerful act of forgiveness Joseph shows his brothers manyyears later becomes a seed event for the conditions of forgiveness that permeatethe rest of the biblical traditions and our lives today.Just as the seeds of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" began in 1941 and repeat atintervals that can be known and predicted, the Torah may actually be the map ofall possibilities that the Genius of Vilna was describing in the 18th century.Since it's a map based upon cycles that begin with a seed event, and as theseeds are described within it, we should not be surprised to discover that theTorah also contains the patterns showing when and how those patterns repeat.It's all about the cycles.If the cycles are still repeating and we're part of them, what can they tell usabout our personal lives and our global future?Hot Spots and Flash Points for the Future\"In a time of drastic change, it is the learners who inherit the future. Thelearned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longerexists [my emphasis].\" With these words, social philosopher Eric Hofferbeautifully described the difference between meaningful knowledge andinformation without meaning. In a world of constant change, to simply know thefacts as the \"learned\" is not enough. To know that a village pump brings thewater of a well to the surface, for example, is great as long as the pump isworking. If it fails, however, and the mechanism that makes it work is amysterious \"black box\" that no one understands, then it may be a long time untilthe village has its own water again.I've witnessed such a crisis personally in a Tibetan village. The entirepopulation relied upon a single well with an antiquated pump for all of theirwater. During one of our visits in the late 1990s, the village elders informedus that the pump had not worked for nearly a month. A closer inspection of themachinery quickly revealed the problem.The pump had been built in 1910, and no one in the village knew how it worked orhow to fix it. When the villagers understood that they could bypass the pump andbring their water up by hand using a \"dip\" system, they no longer had to travelto a nearby town for the tedious task of importing their water. They could gettheir own from the same well that they had always used in the past; it's justthat to do so was a manual effort. It's all about bringing what we know to bearupon the conditions of the moment.Hoffer's simple yet profound statement brings the idea of time's cycles directlyto our lives today. As noted in the Introduction, both the scientific expertsand the ancient traditions tell us that we're living a time like no other in therecorded history of humankind. While there seems to be agreement that the early21st century is a period of great change, the reasons behind the change couldnot appear more different.Scientists describe our time of change as a series of separate crises that justhappen to be occurring at the same time. From the shift in climate; rising sealevels; and depletion of food, water, and oil to the tilt of the earth's axisand one of the strongest solar cycles in history, modern experts see our time asa convergence of multiple-yet separate-challenges that face our planetsimultaneously.While many indigenous traditions acknowledge the same problems, from theirancient worldview they are anything but separate. Following the wisdom of theirancestors' instructions, those who live a little more aligned with theprinciples of nature see modern crises as a by-product of something greater, asthe changes that always seem to come with the end of time and the beginning of anew world age.If we bear this idea in mind, what can we learn from studying the cycles oftime? Now that we know that they exist and how they work, are there pitfallsfrom the past that we may recognize, prepare for, and even prevent in thefuture? Once again, our Time Code Calculator helps us answer this question.[images/00040.jpg]History will show that the 20th century witnessed the greatest suffering, withthe greatest number of lives lost at the hands of other humans, in the entirehistory of the species. Any doubt as to the truth of this statement disappearswith historian Eric Hobsbawm's direct assessment of the 20th century as the\"most murderous century in recorded history.\"5Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former U.S. national security advisor under the Carteradministration, estimated that by the 1990s, before the century was evencomplete, violence stemming from what has been called \"man's inhumanity to man\"cost between 167 and 175 million lives-roughly the equivalent of the populationsof Great Britain, France, and Italy !6 The cause of the deaths was largely dueto two world wars; the violent competition for land, oil, minerals, and otherresources; and the seemingly relentless efforts to \"cleanse\" entire societiesbased on principles of race, religion, and ethnic background.While the same century that witnessed so much suffering saw many good thingshappen as well, it's the great tragedies that leave us reeling and asking thequestion \"Can the same thing happen again?\" From the perspective of cycles, theanswer is yes. It seems that once the patterns that spawn such tragedies arecreated, they continue to repeat at rhythmic intervals until something changesthem.While I've stated this before, it's important to note that it's the conditionsthat repeat, not the events themselves. If we know that the time is ripe for theconditions to appear, we can take extra steps-such as global prayer, sensitivedialogue, and measured tolerance during tense situations-to be certain that wedon't fall into the ancient trap of where the cycles may have led in the past.Time Code 13: Our knowledge of repeating cycles allows us to pinpoint times inthe future when we can expect to see the repeating conditions of the past.Is it possible to look ahead and anticipate the flash points of the future sothat we can prepare for them in the present? Absolutely! The Time CodeCalculator can help us identify precisely where they are. Let's begin by lookingat the events in the last century that led to some of the greatest tragedies inhistory. If we recognize these cycles of possibility and when they willreappear, then they also represent the greatest window of opportunity to avoidthe suffering and replace it with healing and peace.In the following section, we will identify key events of the last century todetermine when the conditions that they created will repeat again. The cyclesthat stem from each event will be summarized in the familiar format that we usedin Chapter 1. As before, the actual calculations have been placed in theappendices (see Appendix B) for continuity and ease of reading.So let's begin where we left off in Chapter 1, with the relationship between1941, the year of the seed event, and the conditions for September 2001 that itspawned. The dates for the return of the 1941 cycle after 2001 wereintentionally omitted. To list them would have made little sense until we hadthe opportunity to explore the nature of cycles-how they work and why theyrepeat.Now that we've done so, we can answer the lingering question as to when, or evenif, any dates between 2001 and the 2012 end of our present world age hold thepotential for repeating the conditions of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" for America.The following chart summarizes the output from the Time Code perspective.Summary 1Cyclic Surprise for Attack on the United States Created in 1941 Conditions[images/00357.jpg][images/00411.jpg][images/00333.jpg]While historians analyze and dissect the wars of the last century, in manyrespects, a strong argument can be made that they essentially originate with thefirst great conflict of the century: World War I. Although technically the warended and peace treaties were signed, the root causes of the political unrestremained; and the rise of dictatorships throughout Europe, including those ofthe Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Spain, can be directly linked to the way theFirst World War ended.It's for this reason that some historians suggest that, in effect, there wasonly a single great war in the 20th century, one that never really ended and hascontinued through subsequent conflicts since that time. Whether we subscribe tosuch a perspective or not, the fact remains that World War I, and the loss ofmore than 40 million human lives, began with the seed events of 1914. Theconditions of 1914 are the primer for the effects that are still seen to thisday. So it makes tremendous sense to begin with this date to calculate when thepatterns that it set into motion will return as the ripples of its repeatingcycle.As with any pattern, the conditions that it creates continue until they arebroken by the introduction of a new pattern. Knowing when and how the cycles ofthe 1914 seed date will appear in our lives gives us the edge to do just that:recognize the symptoms of war-producing conflict when it appears and prepare forwhat it may bring, while working at the same time to break the cycle byintroducing a new pattern of peace.The following summary tracks the Time Code calculations from 1914 to the end ofthe 2012 great cycle to show us when the choice points of peace (see Chapter 7)reappear. Similar to the way McKenna's TimeWave Zero program exhibited morecomplexity compressed into briefer periods of time toward the end of the cycle,the Time Code calculations after 2011 are so frequent that I have shown only thefirst as an indicator of when the window of opportunity appears.Summary 2The Cyclic Conditions of World War Created in 1914[images/00353.jpg][images/00348.jpg][images/00201.jpg]The years shown in Summary 2 are the times when the cyclic conditions for globalwar have been, are, or will be present. Just as we discovered with the 1984expression of the 1941 seed date in Chapter 1, the presence of the conditionsdoes not always mean that what happened on the seed date will occur again. Ittells us that the conditions are in place and that the event may repeat. TheArab-Israeli war of 1973 is a perfect example of what I mean here.Known by names that range from the Yom Kippur War and the Ramadan War to theOctober War of 1973, the conflict began when a coalition of Arab states led byEgypt and Syria attacked Israel on October 6, 1973, in a dispute over borders.While the entire war lasted only 20 days, it occurred within the context of theglobal tension created by the Cold War. As is so often the case in regionalwars, the two sides directly involved had ties with the larger nations andsuperpowers. It is those ties that carry the potential to escalate the conflictinto a larger war, one even on a global scale. This is precisely what happenedduring in 1973.A request from Egypt's president, Anwar el-Sadat, asking the Soviet Union formilitary aid; the Russian response to mobilize troops in preparation forbestowing that aid; and the U.S. decision to move American military forces to aDefense Condition (DEF- CON) 3, a rare heightened state of alert used inpreparation for possible war, were the catalyst for yet another crisis thatbrought the world to the brink of a confrontation between the two Cold Warsuperpowers. Fortunately, through a series of sensitive negotiations, whichexcluded the United States President at the time, cooler heads prevailed. TheEgyptians retracted their request for help from the Soviet Union, and the UnitedNations Security Council passed Resolution 339 on October 23 asking the warringstates to honor an earlier cease-fire.The point here is that the conditions were in place and the stage was set for aregional conflict to escalate to a global war during the year when the cyclecarrying those conditions was repeating. The Time Code Calculator demonstratesthis beautifully, showing that 1973 is precisely the year when the 1914conditions of world war would appear as a repeating cycle (see Appendix B,example 5). Now that we know how the cycles appear, the additional dates inSummary 2 will be the opportunity to put into place what we've learned to headoff such close calls.[images/00049.jpg]Only two atomic weapons have ever been used in wartime against civilianpopulations. Both were detonated by the United States. Both events happened inthe same year, 1945, at the end of World War II.The following example clearly shows how the conditions created by this singleevent planted the seeds for a cycle that has repeated these conditionsthroughout time. In each year indicated, the stage was set for the conditions ofatomic capabilities to threaten the world once again. Fortunately, while theconditions have been present and there has been a focus upon nuclearcapabilities, the events themselves haven't lived up to the fullest expressionof the cycle's potential. The year 2010 will be the next opportunity for thereturn of the conditions of 1945, as well as the opportunity to break the cycleand set a new pattern for the new world age.Summary 3The Cyclic Weapons Nuclear and of (Use 1945 in Created Conditions the WWII) ofEnd[images/00171.jpg][images/00359.jpg][images/00410.jpg]While our ability to recognize such cycles doesn't necessarily change them orprevent their parallel conditions from recurring, it does give us a powerfulinsight into when to be on the alert for a repeated cycle. It offers us theopportunity to respond to the parallel conditions in a responsible manner whenthey show up. If we know, for example, that a nation's acts of aggression, suchas the 1990 invasion of Kuwait's oil fields by Iraq, is happening during a cyclethat carries the 1914 conditions of World War I, then we also know that clearcommunication and sensitive diplomacy will be especially important during thisvulnerable period of time in order to keep the conflict from blowing out ofcontrol and fulfilling the cycle's seed potential.It's at precisely such times that a response meant to send a clear signal that\"enough is enough\" can be misread and escalate before we know it. Asdeclassified NSA documents revealed in 2005, Vietnam's Gulf of Tonkin incidentis a perfect example of just how easily unnecessary results can be triggered bywartime fears.'In the midst of the Cold War tensions in 1964, the actions of two reported navalengagements between the United States and North Vietnam sparked America's firstlarge-scale troop deployments into Southeast Asia. The incidents occurred withintwo days of one another in the waters of the Tonkin Gulf. The declassifieddocuments show, however, that only one of the reported events actually occurred.The first incident, between the U.S. destroyer Maddox and three North Vietnamesetorpedo boats on August 2 of that year, is verified and well documented. Thesecond incident is where the uncertainty, and mystery, lies. What thedeclassified documents show is that the \"attack\" that the U.S. destroyersreported, and returned fire to, never happened. While the American destroyersdid fire at what they believed was a threat at the time, the reports show that,in fact, there was none. The exact words of the declassified report state: \"Intruth, Hanoi's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two ofthe boats damaged on 2 August.\"8Under the suspicious atmosphere that became the hallmark of the Cold War, andwith the crew's anxious state of mind following the artillery exchange only twonights before, some historians suggest that the U.S. sailors may have mistakenlyread unusual radar blips on the night of August 4. Believing that they wereunder a second attack from the North Vietnamese, they fired in response to whatthey thought was a follow-up attack. While the mystery of that night may remainunsolved, the fact is that the American response meant to signal strength andresolve to ease the rising tensions actually had the opposite effect and was adirect factor leading to the escalation of the war that would last into the nextdecade and cost approximately 58,000 American lives.America's Economic Collapse: No Secret to the Cycles!\"It's official: the crash of the U.S. economy has begun.\" With these words,writer and consultant Richard C. Cook began an article published by the Centrefor Research on Globalization. While such captions were common during the autumn2008 meltdown of the world's financial markets, at the time when this headlineappeared nothing could have sounded more ominousor more unlikely. Ominousbecause of what such a crash would mean. Unlikely because, at least on thesurface, America's economy appeared to be nowhere near any kind of collapse. Thedate was June 13, 2007: full 14 months before the actual crisis of 2008occurred.Cook's article describes the work of two leading economists who were lookingbeyond the outward signs of America's seemingly booming economy at somethingmuch deeper. Steven Pearlstein, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for businessand economy who writes for The Washington Post, and Robert Samuelson, acontributing editor for Newsweek and The Washington Post since 1977, both sawthe same fracture in the economy at the same time. And what they saw wasfrightening.They were concerned about the growing number of companies that had huge amountsof debt compared to their profits and the vulnerability of those companies tobuyouts that were financed through borrowing even more money (leveragedbuyouts). In words that clearly reflected his concern, Pearlstein stated:\"Across the board, stock prices and company valuations will fall. Banks willannounce painful write-offs, some hedge funds will close their doors, andprivate equity funds will report disappointing returns. Some companies will beforced into bankruptcy or restructuring.\" 10 Even for those not familiar withthe technical-sounding lingo of stock-market analysts and economists, themessage was clear. This was a warning, and those with interests in the Americaneconomy were being warned.What these economists and others like them were telling the rest of us was that2007 marked the year when the conditions fell into place for the perfect globaleconomic storm to unleash its fury. Whenever it happened, the U.S. economy wouldbe directly in its path. While they accurately predicted the scenario, it'sunclear if even Pearlstein and Samuelson could have known how the storm theydescribed would trigger the collapse of an entire world's economy.We've all heard it said that vision is always 20/20 in hindsight. In otherwords, it's easy to look back at everything, from a military crisis to the lossof an NFL championship-or even to the end of a marriage-after it is over and beable to see all of the things that could have averted the crisis. Hindsight iseasy. And it's accurate for one obvious reason: everything we're looking at hasalready happened!All the same, as I watched the earnings of the New York Stock Exchange plungefurther and further into negative territory on September 29, 2008, I had thesame feeling and asked the same questions that had occurred to me on September11, 2001: Is this crisis part of a larger pattern? If so, could we have known inadvance and acted differently to avert it?Unlike the seven years that separated the crisis of September 11 and thedevelopment of the Time Code Calculator, I didn't have to wait long for myanswer. I had watched America's financial meltdown from a series of cities andhotel rooms where I was doing business at the end of September 2008-withoutaccess to the Time Code Calculator. As soon as I returned home, I immediatelywent to the appendices for this book to discover what role, if any, economiccycles were playing in the world's financial chaos.Using the same process described earlier in this chapter, I went through thesteps of Mode 1 of the calculator in order to find out when the conditions of apast event were most likely to reappear. I began by identifying the date whenthe seeds of the 2008 economic collapse could have been planted. From theexperts along Wall Street to the commentators in the nation's media, thecomparison was obvious and nearly unanimous.Before the stock market lost 777 points in the largest singleday drop in thehistory of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the previous record had been heldby another loss that occurred in the same market 79 years earlier. Over thecourse of two autumn days in 1929, the \"Black Thursday\" of October 24 followedby the \"Black Tuesday\" of October 29, America's young stock market lost 23percent of its previous value. The panic and sell-off that followed led to adecline in the American financial system that would continue until it bottomedout nearly three years later. It was then that the Dow Jones Industrial Averageclosed at a reading that sounds impossible by today's standards. Incredibly, byJuly 8, 1932, the New York Stock Exchange had lost 89 percent of its previousvalue and closed with a reading of only 41.22 points. Clearly, the conditions of1929 are the logical comparison for the crash of 2008. Except for the magnitudeof the loss, at first glance the outward conditions seem eerily similar.Using 1929 as the seed year for the Time Code calculations, the process quicklyrevealed the next date when we could expect the conditions of an economiccollapse to reappear. That date was 1979.42. Just as we did in the previousexamples, 1979.42 then became the new seed date for the next round ofcalculations, yielding the second opportunity for economic chaos to repeat:1999. These calculations were performed two more times to find the remainingyears before 2012 when the cycles for economic collapse in the U.S. and theworld were likely to repeat. Summary 4 shows the results for the calculationslocated in Appendix A (beginning with Example 10).Summary 4The Cyclic Economy) U.S. the of (Crash 1929 in Created Conditions[images/00363.jpg][images/00196.jpg][images/00332.jpg]Because the stock-market crash that I was seeing in real time was taking placein 2008, at first the dates made little sense. Why did the calculator indicate2007, for example? Why not 2008? I searched the literature and returned toPearlstein and Samuelson's findings for a deeper understanding of what thecycles were actually showing. In two sentences I found the bridge between thecalculator's results and the reality of the September stock-market collapse. \"Itis impossible to predict when the magic moment will be reached and everyonefinally realizes that the prices being paid for these companies, and the debttaken on to support the acquisitions, are unsustainable [my emphasis],\"Pearlstein stated. Leaving little doubt about the consequences of such arealization, his next sentence said everything: \"When that happens, it won't bepretty.\" From an economist's perspective, the \"magic moment\" arrived onSeptember 29, 2008.With this observation, my questions had been answered.The calculator was showing that the conditions for the economic chaos predictedby the article had arrived precisely on schedule in 2007. As Pearlstein stated,however, the unknown factor was when investors would recognize the conditionsand react to what they had discovered. What's important here is that experts \"inthe know\" saw what was happening beforehand, such as the sharp rise in oilprices that seems to precede such chaos, and realized that the crash wasinevitable. They announced what they knew when the conditions were in place in2007.But what about the other two dates: 1979 and 1999? Obviously there was nofinancial meltdown anywhere near the size of those during 1929 and 2008. Whatwas the calculator telling us?As I researched both dates, I realized that we were very lucky on bothoccasions. In the same way that a sharp rise in oil prices had triggered adomino effect that highlighted the weakness of the economy in 2008, somethingvery similar had happened in 1979 and 1999. During both years another perfecteconomic storm was looming when unexpected conditions converged. And during botha global economic crisis had been a very real possibility. Fortunately, it wasonly the conditions that were present. For reasons that will follow, the stormthat the conditions could have spawned never materialized. The year 1979 is aperfect example of a crisis averted.At the beginning of the year, the indicators used by experts to gauge the healthof the economy (things like customer demand, strong sales, and lean inventories)looked promising. There was every reason to believe that it would be a good yearfor the nation's finances. But there was one factor that even the experts hadn'ttaken into account, the same one that began the decline in the 2008 economy: theprice of oil. Through increases that occurred during two critical times of theyear, at the beginning and again at the end, the price of crude oil rose nearly100 percent. When it did, shock waves of reduced spending rippled throughout theAmerican economy. Similar conditions led to a loss of 630 points on the NYSE inOctober 1999 and set into motion the conditions for the economic slowdown thatfollowed in 2000.While there are probably a number of reasons why the economy didn't completelycollapse during the 1979 time frame, an analysis by the Economic ResearchDepartment of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis may explain one of themost significant. According to the report, the 1979 rise in oil pricesautomatically caused the federal budget to tighten in response.\" In doing so,individual incomes were placed into higher tax brackets, which forced a decreasein the spending habits of some citizens. In other words, the higher taxesreduced the amount of money available, and spending was curbed, which ultimatelyslowed the growth of the economy.Unfortunately, for reasons that are beyond the scope of this section, thatsystem didn't operate as it was designed to when the oil prices skyrocketed totheir highest in history during summer 2008. The key here is that such marketextremes appear to be linked to a cycle, one that may be known and predicted.The Time Code Calculator indicates that we may be faced with similar economicconditions and the possibility of yet one more financial crisis before thepresent cycle ends in 2012. Interestingly, the year that it indicates is thesame one when the conditions of a number of other seed dates may reappear aswell: the year 2010. As different and disparate as the seed dates appear, fromthe cycle of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" that began in 1941 and reappeared in 2001,to the use of atomic weapons in 1945, and the crash of the United States'economy in 1929, the opportunity for the next appearance of each of theseconditions occurs within the same year.While it's probably not insignificant that so many cycles are converging duringsuch a small window of time, it's important to remember that the end of anycycle also marks the beginning of the next. As we'll discuss in Chapter 7, thisis the good news that the convergence of so many cycles may be calling to ourattention. At the end of one and the beginning of the next, nature offers us thegreatest chance for change. So it's precisely because so many differentcycles-of such great magnitude, representing so many different kinds ofexperiences-are ending within the same period of time that the 2010 time framemay well represent one of our best junctures to make new choices. As the oldcycles end and the new ones begin, we share the rare opportunity to reset thecourse of our personal and global paths for the future. We may also find thatit's the perfect time to do so, well before the 2012 window arrives.As with any window of change, the power of the opportunity begins withacknowledgment that a choice is possible.The Seeds of Love and BetrayalThe cycles of nature apply to our personal lives as well as to global events.While we probably know this relationship intuitively, it often shows up in ourlives in ways, and at times, that are the least opportune or that we leastexpect. For example, we've all heard of people who leave their relationships,jobs, and friends and move to a new city for a \"fresh start.\" You can probablyguess what often happens to those of us who do.While a change of scenery can sometimes be just what the doctor ordered, it'snot uncommon to find that while the people, weather, and skylines changed, thecircumstances that we thought we were leaving behind us may not. Why would they?The cycles of our world and our lives are made of time and space, the stuff ofthe universe that cannot be bound by a building or a city. When we think aboutour lives from this perspective, it should come as no surprise that the cyclesthat play such a powerful role in the world play an equally powerful role in ourpersonal lives. Once again, the key to uncovering such patterns is to recognizewhere they begin.[images/00039.jpg]The house felt different that morning. Although it was a Saturday, a day that myfather normally used to catch up on the sleep he'd lost from working long hoursearlier in the week, he and my mom were up early. It just didn't feel like atypical weekend. There was no singing from my mom as she went about her endlessroutines of homemaking. The TV screen that would normally echo the news of theweek was black and cold; and there was no radio blaring Peter, Paul and Marysongs from my parents' bedroom. Even though my mom and dad were up, except forthe shuffling of footsteps moving from one room to another across the hardwoodfloors, the house was absolutely silent.Cautiously, I tiptoed from my room down the hallway and peeked into Mom andDad's bedroom. My father was there with a small suitcase open on the bed,packing his crisp corporate shirts. \"Good morning, son,\" he said as he caughtsight of me from out of the corner of his eye. \"Come in here for a minute. Iwant to talk to you.\" Things had been tense in our house for a while. I knewthat my parents were having a tough time, and my first thought was that I wasgoing to get an explanation at last. I was right, but it wasn't the one that I'dexpected.\"I'm going away for a while,\" my father said, \"and I'm not sure when I'm comingback.\" That was it. I watched as he closed his suitcase and followed him as hewalked down the hallway and passed my mom in the kitchen. Her eyes were stillred from crying after the conversation they'd had the night before. Together,she and I watched as my dad left our house that day. I didn't know it at thetime, but I had just witnessed the ending of my parents' marriage. I was 11 atthe time.It wasn't until years later that I began to understand how much that momentaffected me. As I came to terms with what that day had meant to me, I realizedthat I had lost not only my father, but also my family-at least the way I hadknown them for the first 11 years of my life.At first I believed that, except for not having my dad around, everything in mylife would continue as normal-everything, that is, except those things whereother boys my age had their fathers present and I didn't. From parent/teachernights at school and father/son weekends with the Boy Scouts, to my first publicspeech to our church congregation and awards presentations at my swim meets, Ibegan to realize that something was missing in my life and that I'd lostsomething else on that Saturday morning as well.The reason why I'm sharing this story here is because it offers an example ofhow an experience carrying a strong emotional imprint at one time in life canbecome the primer for the conditions of that experience to repeat throughoutother times. Just as the seed event that established the pattern for \"surprise\"and \"attack\" on American soil was set in 1941, the meaning that we give to atraumatic experience can set into motion a cyclic pattern that can follow usthroughout our lives.If the experience is a positive one of love and life-affirming emotions, thenit's probably not a problem. There's certainly no need to recognize it and healanything. My sense is, however, that we seldom complain of finding ourselves\"stuck\" in mysterious patterns of joy, healing, and peace in our lives. When wedo, it's probably not something that we want to change.It's the negative patterns that will inevitably arise from the situations ofeveryday life-moments of loss, hurt, and betrayal, for example-that can becomethe unconscious seeds for a pattern that shows up again and again. Fortunately,just as repeating cycles are also opportunities to change the patterns for warand aggression on a worldwide scale, if we know our individual cycles and howthey work, they can become powerful allies in healing some of the greatest hurtsof our personal lives.Calculating Personal CyclesThe Time Code Calculator can help us find such cycles in our lives. To thecalculator, a cycle is a cycle, whether it is personal or global. The key is torecognize that life follows nature's rhythms, and our emotional patterns arepart of life.Time Code 14: The Time Code Calculator can pinpoint personal cycles of love andhurt, as well as global cycles of war and peace.Using Mode 3 of the Time Code Calculator, we can calculate the times in ourlives for the repeating conditions of any emotional experience that has left itsimprint on our hearts. It's amazing to see how deeply the experiences from onetime in life-from our greatest loves to our deepest hurts-can impact otherrelationships after the seed is planted.If we can identify one of two keys, then we can also bring to light thosepatterns and be aware of when they may repeat in our business, casual, andintimate relationships. So let's begin with the example that we started thissection with: my feeling of losing my family.Although my mom, my younger brother, and I were still together and outwardly westill worked as a family unit, the key is that I felt I'd lost my family. Inthat feeling, I also experienced a sense of loss and betrayal. So just as\"surprise\" and \"attack\" are the clear descriptors for what happened on September11, 2001, loss and betrayal are those for my personal experience. They becamethe seed for a pattern that would continue until I recognized its presence.In the example that follows, I use my experience of loss and betrayal toillustrate this point. Because the calculations are brief, I have included themhere in the text rather than creating a separate appendix.Mode 3: Find the time we can expect the conditions of a personal experience fromthe past to happen again. To answer this question, we need a single piece ofinformation.> • Input: Our age when an obvious momentous event (the seed) occurredThe Time Code Calculation[images/00308.jpg][images/00261.jpg][images/00120.jpg]In my case, this would look as follows:[images/00323.jpg][images/00338.jpg][images/00340.jpg]From this simple calculation, it's evident that the age of 17.798 is when theconditions of betrayal and loss that I experienced at 11 years old could beexpected to repeat. As the examples of global war and peace in the precedingsection illustrate, although the conditions may lead to a repeat of the seedexperience, the presence of the conditions isn't a promise that it will repeat.However, in my case, it did.It was during this time that I lost two relationships in my life, both for thesame reason. One was a friendship and the other was a romance; and both involvedwhat I perceived as betrayal of trust, confidences, and promises. (If I hadknown then what I now understand about cycles, I might have saved myself yearsof asking why.)When we use these calculations in our lives, there are seldom absolutes andrarely exact repeats of earlier situations. What we are looking for are generalpatterns that can give us a \"heads-up\" in business or romance. Following is apartial list of how the cycles of betrayal and loss continued for a number ofyears in personal and business relationships, until they were recognized andreplaced with a new pattern of clear communication and discernment.Summary 4Cycles-the Personal Cyclic Family of Loss the from Created Conditions[images/00398.jpg][images/00327.jpg][images/00335.jpg]The cycles identified by the Time Code Calculator work for positive experiencesof success and accomplishment as well as for the lessons of hurt. Just as thefirst experience of emotional trauma creates the pattern of repeating cycles,the gratifying feelings of accomplishment and success are the conditions createdas the seed events following their first appearance in life.In all likelihood, our very first examples of such gratifying experiences mayhave faded from memory by the time we reach adulthood, so our earliestrecollection of accomplishment that follows the original experience will serveas the seed event for these calculations. To find patterns related to anexperience of success and accomplishment, we again turn to Mode 3 of the TimeCode Calculator.Mode 3: Find the times we can expect the conditions of a success andaccomplishment from the past to happen again. To answer this question, we need asingle piece of information.> • Input: Our age when an obvious pattern (the seed) occurredWhile I was still in high school, I knew that I wanted to study earth and spacesciences at the college level. I also knew that I would be the first person inmy family to obtain a university degree, and that the tuition to do so would bemy responsibility. Looking for a way to earn and save as much money as I couldas quickly as possible, I found a copper mill in a nearby town that paid unionwages, had a full-time night shift, and could help me turn my college dream intoa reality. Each Wednesday I would walk directly onto the factory floor and talkto the supervisor about a job. Each week for four months he said there were noopenings.Just after my 16th birthday, all of that changed. I was hired as a full-timeemployee on the 4 P.M. to midnight shift. Two years later I had saved enoughmoney to pay the out-of-state tuition at the Florida Institute of Technology inMelbourne, Florida. The elation and sense of accomplishment I felt the day I washired was the seed for a pattern that has repeated like clockwork throughout myentire adult life since then.Here is how a calculation based on the seed of my successful life experiencelooks:[images/00123.jpg][images/00403.jpg][images/00176.jpg]The age of 25.88 is when the conditions of accomplishment that I experienced atthe age of 16 could be expected to repeat. Following is a partial list of howthe cycles of accomplishment and success continued for a number years in mypersonal and business relationships. Interestingly, some of them actuallyoverlap with the earlier cycles of loss and betrayal that I described. That'sprecisely what cycles do: they play out again and again as nested experienceswithin nested experiences.Summary 5Personal Cycles-the Cyclic Conditions Created From Success and Accomplishment[images/00324.jpg][images/00103.jpg][images/00337.jpg]When we look to the cycles of our lives, it's important to remember that thereare no absolutes. Because we are dealing with natural processes that follow therhythms of natural cycles, the choices that we make at any time in our lives canforever change the course of a given cycle. When they do, we begin the newpatterns of a new one.The key in exploring personal cycles is to recognize, first, that it'shappening; and, second, the frequency with which it repeats. In doing so, we canprepare for the conditions the cycle offers while making the choices that becomethe new patterns of the future.Herein we find the value of using the Time Code Calculator for the 2012 enddate. Just as we can explore our personal histories to find the seeds of what wecan expect in the future, we can use our knowledge of fractal patterns andnature's cycles to discover the key dates that tell us where to look in the pastfor the conditions that we can expect for 2012... and beyond.[images/00052.jpg][images/00055.jpg]\"The future has already happened, it just isn't very well distributed.\"- William Gibson, contemporary science-fiction writer\"Will you change it?\"- Coded message regarding prophecies of destruction, discovered in the ancientTorah\"7.8 Earthquake Rocks China.\"\"Baton Rouge Takes Brunt of Hurricane Gustav.\"\"Southern California Declared Disaster Area.\"What were once rare captions that commanded our attention have become all toofrequent. While we're still in awe of the power of Mother Nature to destroycenturies of history and lifetimes of human effort in a single day, we'reprobably less surprised because we've seen it happen so many times. In the firstyears of the 21st century, tornados, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, massiveflooding, earthquakes, and droughts have taken an unprecedented toll upon humanlife, property, and a major portion of the world's infrastructure.One earthquake alone in China's Sichuan Province, for example, killed more than69,000 people and caused an estimated $20 billion in damages. Cyclone Nargis inMyanmar killed at least 84,000 people and left in excess of $10 billion indamages. In North America, Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans,leaving over 1,000 people dead and more than $81 billion in damages.There can be little doubt in the minds of anyone in the world today that life onplanet Earth simply isn't business as usual. It's clear that something ishappening-and it's big. But just what, and how big, is \"it\"? Maybe Peggy Noonan,a journalist for The Wall Street Journal, best summarizes the uniqueness of ourtime: \"We are living Days of Lore. Days of big history.\" Clarifying what shemeans by \"big history,\" she continues, \"We are living through an epoch scholars50 years hence will ask about and study.... They will see us, you and me, asgrizzled veterans of something big.\"From the 8,000-year-old Hindu Vedas and the ancient Mayan calendar to theindigenous prophecies of Asia and the Americas, the timekeepers of the worldseem to agree with Noonan. They have predicted, anticipated, welcomed, andfeared the events of our time. As frightening as some of the stories andprophecies are, however, it's important to note that there is nothing in any ofthem that tells us unconditionally that the world itself ends, or leaves anydoubt that we will survive what lies before us. What they do say is that thecycle that has spawned the world as we know it is over and the next begins. Aswe've seen in the preceding chapters, it all happens in our lifetime.[images/00056.jpg]\"There it is!\" I heard someone exclaim as we rounded the curve that marked thetop of the mountain pass. Holding on to the overhead rail where I was standing,I ducked my head to see out the dusty window on the right side of the bus. As myeyes scanned the barren rock that filled my entire view, the landscape suddenlychanged. The dark cliffs gave way to the blue-white ice of a glacier that seemedto hang suspended from the jagged cliffs above.\"How beautiful,\" I whispered to myself. \"How absolutely beautiful.\" The steamfrom my breath hung in the early-morning chill inside our vintage bus. It hadbeen driven from the Chinese mainland and into Tibet at our request, just forthis journey across the high plateau. While it was definitely old, we also knewthat this ancient-looking bus was more rugged and reliable than the newervehicles-shiny low-riding tour vans that could never have made it over thetrails and washed-out roads that led to this glacier. \"Rest stop,\" I heard ourtranslator blurt out as our bus slowed to a halt on the side of the road.Revelation at 16,000 FeetWe had just crossed a pass that was 16,000 feet above sea level, the highestpoint of the day on our journey out of Tibet toward the Nepalese border. The airunder the mountain clouds was cold, thin, and magnificent. As I hopped from thelast step of the bus onto the smooth rocks that marked the edge of the valley, Iwas greeted in a way that I would never have expected in a million years.The flap of a primitive-looking tent made of thick, dark yak fur flew open and abeautiful young Tibetan woman emerged, looking more than a little surprised tosee us. Dressed in brightly colored skirts and robes, she was a powerfulcontrast to the dark hues of the mountain as she walked directly toward me.Without taking her eyes from my face, she directed a question to our translatorwhere he stood nearby. Following suit, he turned his face toward her, even as headdressed me with his translation of her words. \"She has asked who we are andwhy we are here,\" he said.\"Please tell her that we've come halfway around the world for a visit,\" I said,hoping that a little humor would translate well and put her at ease. As theTibetan version of my answer reached the woman, her concerned expression gaveway to a widening grin. The translator continued. \"She says that she doesn't getmany visitors here,\" he said, \"and she says that we are welcome.\"With that, everyone was smiling. Our group of 22 (too many to fit into one tent)was immediately divided into smaller groups and escorted out of the wind andinto the shelter of various tents for hot yak-butter tea. Our guide and Ifollowed the woman who had greeted us. Suddenly she stopped in her tracks andturned to me. Right there in the middle of the field, she began firing sentencesat me so fast that I could only wait for the translations to catch up. When theydid, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.\"Do you know how special this time is in the history of the world?\" she began.\"Do you know that everything is about to change?\" For the next ten minutes orso, I listened as the woman shared the tradition that her people have heldsacred for centuries: preparing for global change and doing so now. Except forthe specifics, such as the local names for constellations, the ages of theworld, and so forth, she was describing in her language the same change that isso familiar throughout other indigenous traditions of the world."},{"pageContent":"She described the recent extremes in her valley's weather, pointing to theglacier that had hovered for generations over her family's camp, providing waterfrom its melting ice. Due to the warmer summers, it was shrinking. It hadalready retreated nearly a third of the way up the mountainside. At the presentrate, it would disappear altogether in a few more years.Suddenly tears filled her eyes as she described how many people in neighboringtribes, and even some closest to her in her own family, had died recently. Itseemed that a new disease had swept through the local villages and camps,claiming those whose immune systems were the weakest, mostly the elders and thechildren. I was never clear on precisely what the disease was or where it camefrom. But from the way she described what had happened, it had obviously passedfrom person to person and was apparently something so new that their bodieshadn't been able to fend it off.Then she began describing how all of humankind is making the choice now thatwill determine the outcome for our time in history. While I had heard similarthemes discussed by people from the deserts of the American Southwest to theAndes of Peru and Bolivia, after 18 days of travel it was the last thing that Iexpected in one of the most remote and pristine places remaining in the world,at a mountain pass over three miles above sea level. Except for the specifics,the words I was hearing could have easily come from a New Age program regardingthe prophecies of a planetary cleansing.How powerful, I thought. The uniqueness of our time in history is such commonknowledge that even this nomadic woman, living isolated from the rest of theworld in one of the highest inhabited lands remaining on Earth today, knowsabout it! Her culture has preserved it, and her traditions allow for it. It'slike the big secret that everyone on the planet knows except those of us in the\"modern\" world.The Signs of the TimeIn some traditions, like that of the Tibetan woman, people just seem to sensethat now is the time of change that their ancestors described. In their ruraland often isolated existence, with little or no contact from people in thetechnological world, the things that they know best are their surroundings: theland, the elements, and nature. These are precisely the things that they seechanging.For centuries, their ancestors told them that when they can no longer grow theircrops at the right time, when the rivers flood, and when their land and the iceof the mountains begin to disappear, these will be indicators that they areliving the time of the great change. From their ancestors' instructions and thesigns of nature, they will know when to prepare for the end of one great cycleand the beginning of the next.Using nature's signs to mark world changes extends beyond the knowledge oftoday's indigenous people. The \"lost\" biblical book of Enoch the Prophet offersa perfect example. Enoch is one of the most honored and mysterious of the OldTestament prophets for a number of reasons-not the least of which is the accountthat states he never died! Instead, at 365 years of age, Enoch left the earthand, as one passage relates, \"walked with God.\"The wisdom and message of Enoch were greatly revered by the earlyChristians-that is, before the book of his powerful visions was removed from theofficial biblical texts. We see evidence from some of the world's great scholarsthat his wisdom was considered divine, and the Book of Enoch was regarded as aholy scripture. The Roman historian Tertullian, for example, stated that thewords of Enoch were \"spoken in the same scripture of the Lord, and everyscripture suitable for edification is divinely inspired.\"'Before he walked with God, Enoch revealed his visions of a great change inEarth's future, which the angels had shown him at his request. During thecataclysmic change that he describes as occurring in \"those days\" when the earthshifts on its axis, Enoch states: \"The rain shall be restrained, and heavenshall stand still ... the fruits of the Earth shall be late, and not flourish intheir season; and in their season the fruits of the trees shall be withholden.The moon shall change its laws, and not be seen at its proper period.\"2Using the astronomical tables in the Book of Enoch, historians have determinedthat his prophecies extend from about 5,000 years ago to the present and thencontinue about a thousand years beyond the 20th century. There is an obviousconsistency between Enoch's description of a changing world and the Hopi recitalof changes at the end of the fourth world. In no uncertain terms, the Hopiprophecy states: \"When earthquakes, floods, hailstorms, drought, and famine willbe the life of every day, the time will have then come for the return to thetrue path ...\"3As much as such descriptions seem to apply to our world today, the problem withEnoch's is that without specific dates or events, it remains open tointerpretation. His phrase in those days could apply to many times in the fivemillennia between his era and ours. Without something concrete to relate to, wefind ourselves back to the question that began this book: what can werealistically expect to see in our world as we approach the time that has beencalculated, predicted, feared, and welcomed for more than 5,000 years?Until now, the answers have been as varied as those who were surveyed. Becausewe've had few facts to base our ideas of 2012 on, much of the popular opinionhas been precisely that: opinion and theory with little concrete information torest upon. Now, all of that has changed.With our understanding of nature's cycles, fractal time, and the Time CodeCalculator, we can look to the past to see what the future may bring.Specifically, we can examine the years for cycles that have already happened tosee what conditions they will carry when they return. As we discovered inChapter 5, the key is that if we know where to look in the past, then we canpredict what patterns to expect in the future.The Time Code TemplateFollowing the success of the Time Code Calculator in correlating the datesleading to September 11, 2001, I began to apply the same principles to explorehistoric events of the past. While I wasn't surprised by the accuracy of thecalculator, I was in awe of the patterns. The undeniable relationship betweencycles of time and the events of our past clearly deserves more study. From theresults revealed to date, however, three principles have become apparent:> 1. The conditions of nature, including human events, do repeat themselves in> cycles.> 2. The conditions of one cycle often repeat with a greater magnitude of> expression in a later cycle.> 3. It's the return of the conditions, rather than the events themselves, that> can be predicted.It's clear beyond any reasonable doubt: from experiences of marriage, divorce,success, and loss to the cycles of war and peace, the same pattern can show upin life time and again. When it does, it's not uncommon for the repeatingpattern to make itself known as an even stronger pattern than before, and oftenone that really catches our attention. We saw an example of this in theIntroduction to this book with the patterns of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" on theUnited States that began in 1941. The crisis that drew America into the SecondWorld War became the seed event for the next two times the conditions wererepeated, the fractal expressions of that event: the plans in 1984 for asurprise nuclear attack during the Cold War and the reality of the surpriseterrorist attacks in 2001.If the 1984 strike against the United States had actually come to fruition,although it was the same pattern, it would be fair to say that the magnitude ofits expression-a nuclear attack against America-would have been greater than theoriginal seed event. The facts of the September 11 attacks followed this patternas well with respect to the manner and the location in which they were carriedout. The key is that patterns identified for an earlier time in history tend torepeat themselves with greater intensity at later dates.Time Code 15: Patterns identified for an earlier time in history tend to repeatthemselves with greater intensity at later dates.To know what conditions the 2012 calendar end date may hold in store, it'simportant to bear in mind that 2012 marks the completion of not only one, buttwo nested cycles of time. The 5,125-year great cycle or world age that endsthen is part of the larger 26,000-year precessional cycle that's also coming toa close at the same time. If we know how to \"read\" the key patterns for both,they will each tell us something different about our respective time in history.The great cycle of 5,125 years, for example, covers about the same period oftime as most of what is regarded as recorded history. So we can look to thiscycle to see how civilization has been influenced by the changes of the past.This includes things like patterns of war and peace and the rise and collapse ofnations and superpowers.Since the 2012 end date is marked by an alignment of planets and stars thathappened before recorded human history, we must go back-way back-to the lasttime such a pattern occurred to get the big picture. This was long before thecurrent world age. It's during this time of an even older cycle that the largerpatterns we are living today become clear. These patterns are seen in suchthings as changes in temperature, the melting of the polar ice caps, solarcycles, and shifts in the magnetic fields of the earth.So, to answer our question of what 2012 means for us, we must take both of thesenested cycles into account. Only then can we give ourselves a realistic pictureof the ancient seeds for what we can expect today.A Window into the PastAs we saw in previous chapters, the Time Code Calculator points us to precisedates in history. But without a way to explore what they mean, they are justinsignificant numbers. To give meaning to our historic dates, we need a way tolook at different points in time through the same kind of window.Based upon the conversations I've had throughout the world since my seminarsbegan in 1986, as well as the questions that have followed, I have chosen threecategories with which to do just that. The window that will help us make senseof the past is a template made of human events, Earth events, and celestialevents.Time Code 16: Using a template of human events, Earth events, and celestialevents gives us a consistent way to view the past as a realistic window to 2012.As we use the Time Code Calculator to search the cycles of time, these simplecategories will give us a consistent way to keep track of what we've found. Oncewe do so, the patterns for what we can expect for 2012 will become clear. Solet's begin with a brief explanation of each class of events, depicting what itis and why it's important.Human EventsHuman events are those things that happen with regard to civilization and theway we respond to the challenges we face as a collective population. Theseinclude the rise and fall of superpowers, cycles of war and peace, and theexpansion and collapse of empires.This is an important category for us today. Historical records suggest a stronglink between the physical changes of the climate that come with a shift in worldages (temperature, rainfall or drought, sea levels, and the depletion ofresources); the cycles of war; failing economies; and the decline ofcivilizations.Earth EventsThe category of Earth events includes the systems of nature that tend to be mostaffected by world-age transitions. History has shown that these are theconditions that drive rapid change in populations and entire civilizations. Theyalso tend to be the events that force us to choose between competition andcooperation as we respond to the changes.Following is a brief discussion of Earth's magnetic fields, perhaps the mostsignificant factor for changes in global temperature, how much energy we receivefrom the sun, the melting of polar ice, and the rise and fall of sea levels.> - Earth's mysterious magnetic fields: Since the discovery of Earth's> magnetosphere in 1958, scientists have recognized that one of the most> significant roles it plays is serving as the shield that protects us from the> harsh effects of solar wind. Every moment of each day, there is a constant> emission of radiation and highenergy particles that stream toward us from the> sun. It is only because of our magnetic \"shroud\" that we are saved from the> dangerous effects such radiation would certainly have on the delicate tissues> of our bodies. It's also due to the strength of the magnetic fields that> Earth's temperatures remain within a constant range over long periods of time.> And this is where the change associated with world-age cycles comes in.> - Magnetic fields and climate: The relationship between the strength of> Earth's magnetic fields and the abrupt climate change that seems to accompany> their shifts is a controversial area of ongoing study. While scientists have> yet to arrive at a consensusat least at one that is published in the> peer-reviewed journals-the documented effects of magnetism on major climate> indicators are clear.Recently two teams of scientists completed a monumental task that gives us anunprecedented snapshot of this relationship for a period of time greater thananything we've seen in the past. In June 1999, a press release announced thesuccessful completion of a drilling project that went deeper into the ice ofAntarctica than anyone had ever drilled before.` For hundreds of thousands ofyears a natural process has created and preserved a record of the earth'sclimate as a layer of air bubbles captured in the Antarctic ice. Each year thetopmost layer \"freezes\" the airborne elements and compounds (oxygen, carbondioxide, and so on); rain; snow; microscopic life; and the microdust present inthat moment of time into a permanent record of that year that adds to thethickness of the ice.As long as the ice remains, we have a virtual library of our planet's historycaptured in the thousands of layers that have accumulated over thousands ofyears. This history includes indicators of global temperatures, availablesunlight, sea levels, and thickness of the ice caps.A new method of using these elements to tell us how strong the magnetic fieldswere in the past now makes the ice cores even more valuable.-' While scientistshave sampled Antarctic ice before, the 1999 completion of the core samples tothe bottom of the ice sheet now gives us an uninterrupted record of Earth'sclimate for the last 420,000 years-the longest continuous period of time thatscientists have ever been able to evaluate. The data revealed from the Antarcticcores give us a powerful key to understanding the many roles that our planet'sfields of magnetism play in our climate and in our lives.In general, it appears that the relationship is as follows: When the fieldlessens, even a little, the weaker shield allows more of the sun's energy toreach Earth's surface. It's this increased solar energy that begins a period ofglobal warming. As the land, oceans, and atmosphere heat up, their warming setsinto motion the events that lead to the climate change seen in the geologicalrecord. We don't have to be climate experts to understand what happens next.The warmer temperatures begin to melt the polar ice, where huge amounts of waterhave been stored for thousands of years. This melting, in turn, releases thewater into the oceans and changes the delicate balance that drives our weatherpatterns. As the melted water mingles with the ocean currents, it changes thesalinity and temperature-two powerful factors that have a direct effect onweather patterns across the planet.This cycle helps give perspective to what scientists are calling the \"abrupt\"climate change of today. While the periods of warming are certainly associatedwith greater levels of \"greenhouse\" gases, such as carbon dioxide, theseprocesses can clearly be seen on a cyclic basis during times when there was nohuman industry. In other words, while civilization has certainly contributed tothe levels of carbon dioxide that normally exist in the atmosphere, the amountof that contribution appears to have accelerated the effects of a natural cyclethat was already under way.`> - Magnetic flip-flops: When we think of things that are certain in life, we> tend to count the magnetic fields of our planet among those certainties. For> as long as anyone living today can remember, every time we have looked at the> needle of a compass, the northern tip has pointed in the same direction: \"up> there\" toward the North Magnetic Pole of the earth. While we tend to think of> Earth's North and South poles as a sure thing, the reality is that our> planet's magnetism is anything but certain. In fact, it's a moving mystery.We know, for example, that every once in a while something almost unthinkableand truly mind-boggling happens. For reasons still not fully understood, and attimes that appear to be unpredictable, our familiar North and South poles tradeplaces. The magnetic field of the Earth does a complete a flip-flop.Although polar reversals haven't happened in the 5,000-year history ofcivilization, the evidence shows that they have taken place routinely in termsof Earth's history. The geological record shows that such magnetic reversalshave already happened 171 times in the last 76 million years, with at least 14of those occurring in the last 4.5 million years alone. And although thegeological record indicates that we have come close to a reversal a number oftimes, scientists believe that the last complete one happened 780,000 years agoduring a time called the Matuyama-Brunhes traii- sitionl, suggesting that we maybe \"overdue\" for the next.7> - Magnetic fields and life: There are countless studies in the scientific> literature that describe how many species of animals, from whales and dolphins> to hummingbirds and wildebeests, rely on Earth's magnetic \"superhighways\" to> navigate their way to feeding and mating grounds. While we may not use them in> quite the same way, it appears that humans are no exception.In 1993, an international team studying magnetoreception, the ability of ourbrains to detect magnetic changes in the earth, announced a discovery that makes2012, the Mayan cycles, and Earth's magnetic fields even more important to ustoday. The team published the remarkable finding that the human brain contains\"millions of tiny magnetic particles.\"8 These particles connect us, just as theydo other animals, to the magnetic field of the earth in a powerful, direct, andintimate way. This connection carries powerful implications. If Earth's magneticfields are changing in the 2012 time frame, then we are affected!We know, for example, that magnetic fields have a profound influence on ournervous systems; our immune systems; and our perceptions of space, time, dreams,and even reality itself. While the strength of our planet's magnetic field maybe measured as a general reading, it varies locally from place to place. Earlyin the 20th century these ribbonlike patterns were charted and published byscientists as a contour map of the world.9 The maps display the strength of themagnetic lines overlaying the continents, showing the places on Earth where thepeople of the world experience the strongest, and the weakest, effects of theplanet's magnetic fields. To understand why this is important for the 2012cycle, we need look no further than consciousness itself.> - Magnetic fields and consciousness: If we think of Earth's magnetic fields as> a form of energetic \"glue,\" then we can use this metaphor as a possible> explanation for why change seems to come faster in some places and slower in> others. Such a \"magnetic glue\" model suggests that the locations with the> stronger magnetic fields (more glue) are more deeply entrenched in tradition> and existing beliefs and ideas. In places where the field is weaker, the> opposite is true. In these places people seem to be compelled to create> change. The key is that although areas of low magnetism may be ripe for> something new, how that change is expressed is up to those living in the> fields.Even without such evidence, however, all know intuitively that we are affectedby planetary magnetic forces. Any lawenforcement worker or health-carepractitioner will attest to the intense and sometimes bizarre behavior that isseen during the full moon each month. When the magnetic strength changessuddenly, it affects the way we feel, and that change can be disorienting if wedon't understand why it happens.To those who do understand, however, such moments can be a powerful gift: anopportunity to release the patterns of belief that have caused pain in theirlives, hurt in their families, and disease in their bodies and a chance toembrace new and life-affirming beliefs in their place. Artists and musiciansknow this and often anticipate the full-moon cycles as periods of greatcreativity. These existing examples of consciousness and magnetism offerimportant insights into how future changes in magnetic strength may affect usduring the 2012 cycle.Celestial EventsAlthough the mystery of Earth's magnetic fields remains, one factor appearscertain. Regardless of the reason why Earth's magnetic fields to shift overtime, the changes begin with a trigger. And that trigger appears to be linked tothings that happen beyond the earth: celestial events throughout the solarsystem, and possibly even the galaxy.For the purposes of our 2012 exploration, the category of celestial eventsfocuses upon the natural cycles of our sun. Through the geological record andthe correlations described previously, we have a reliable record of how muchradiant energy-solar lumiiiosity -has reached the earth in the past. This factorhas been shown to play a key role in driving changes of climate andcivilization's response to those changes.> - Cycles of the sun: From the time Galileo's first telescopes allowed sky> gazers to observe the heavens, European astronomers have known that our sun> experiences regular cycles of intense magnetic storms-sunspots-followed by> predictable periods of quiet. These cycles have been observed on a regular> basis since 1610. Since the measurements began, 23 cycles of sunspots> averaging 11 years each have occurred, with the last beginning in May of 1996.> Precisely when cycle 23 would end remained a mystery until the spring of 2006> when NASA reported the event that astronomers had been waiting for. On March> 10 of that year, the magnetic storms and solar flares suddenly stopped, and> the sun became \"quiet,\" signaling the end of the 23rd sunspot cycle. The> quiet, however, is misleading.The end of a cycle is an indication that a new one, with new storms, isbeginning. What makes the coming cycle so different is that the strength ofsunspots observed from 1986 to 1996 suggests that cycle 24 is going to be one ofthe most intense ever recorded. \"The next sunspot cycle will be 30 percent to 50percent stronger than the previous one,\" says Mausumi Dikpati of the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado.\"' David Hathaway ofthe National Space Science and Technology Center agrees, suggesting that thesunspots created in the previous cycle are expected to amplify themselves and\"reappear as big sunspots\" in the new cycle. 11An unexpected twist regarding when the new cycle will peak with its greatestintensity occurred in the spring of 2008. Even though cycle 24 had definitelystarted, three sunspots with the characteristics of the previous one appeared onthe 28th of January. NASA's Hathaway explained what this means in a technicalbulletin: \"We have two solar cycles in progress at the same time. Solar Cycle 24has begun (the first new-cycle spot appeared in January of 2008), but SolarCycle 23 has not ended.\"12 In other words, the cycles are overlapping! Whilesuch activity has occurred in the past, it is generally short-lived. This isimportant to us because the peak of the new cycle is directly related to the oldone's activity.Based upon the behavior of the present sunspots, and taking into considerationthe observations of the 1986-1996 solar cycles, both NASA and NCAR team leaderMausumi Dikpati have calculated the same year for solar maximum: the time ofsolar cycle 24's greatest intensity. Perhaps it is no surprise that theprojected time coincides with the Mayan calculations of our sun's alignment withthe center of our galaxy: the year 2012.If these predictions are accurate, the solar magnetic storms will be second inintensity only to those of 1958 when the aurora borealis lit up the night sky asfar south as Mexico. At that time, however, we didn't have communicationstechnology that could be disrupted by such storms.Building the 2012 TemplateThe first known civilization is widely accepted by scholars as occurring inMesopotamia, sometimes called the \"Cradle of Civilization,\" approximately 5000B.C. While there were certainly people living well before this time, it'sbelieved that organized hubs of human cities originated about 7,000 years ago.Because this span of time starts before the beginning of our great cycle, theterm civilization includes everything that has happened during our current worldage, lasting from 3114 B.C. to the present. So when we apply the Time CodeCalculator to investigate the effect of 2012 on human events and civilization,it makes sense to use the Mayan great cycle-our world age of 5,125 yearsas thewindow of time considered.When we use the Time Code Calculator to find patterns of Earth events, however,those patterns occur over periods that are much longer than the 5,125 years ofthe world age. They happen over spans of time that are studied on the geologicscale covering hundreds of thousands, and sometimes millions, of years. Toanswer the question of what Earth events we can expect for 2012, we must look tothe larger \"parent\" cycle of which the current world age is part. This is theentire precessional cycle discussed in Chapter 2, which lasts for approximately26,000 years. Because each cycle holds clues that give us a clearer picture ofwhat we can expect, we will apply the Time Code Calculator to both.With the broad categories of human events, Earth events, and celestial events,and keeping the 5,000- and 26,000-year cycles in mind, we can now build a bridgeto the past that gives us a window to the future. Our bridge will identify fivekeys:> 1. The cycle we are working with, as discussed on the preceding page> 2. The target date of 2012> 3. The seed date for the pattern that the Time Code Calculator computes> 4. The seed date adjusted for the modern (Gregorian) calendar> 5. The significant things that happened on that date shown as the three> categories identified in the previous sectionSo let's begin. First, we will use the Time Code Calculator, as we have inprevious chapters, to identify the key date within each cycle that tells uswhere we can find the patterns that will repeat in 2012. These dates are basedupon our knowledge of the fractal nature of time and the ratio that governs somuch of nature within time.As we have done in the earlier chapters, I've placed the details of ourcalculations in the appendices (see Appendix C) for ease of reading. The resultsof the Time Code calculations are as follows:For the world-age cycle of 5,125 years, the seed date for the conditions we canexpect in 2012 occurred 3,164 years before that date, in the year 1155 B.C.For the precessional cycle of 25,625 years, the seed date for the conditions wecan expect in 2012 occurred 15,836 years before that date, in the year 13,824B.C.Before we get to the summary, I've included a simple legend to describe what thecolumn headings for the comparisons mean. Briefly, they are as follows:> • Previous cycle: Indicates which of the cycles we are looking at.> • Reference date: Indicates the date calculated by the Time Code Calculator to> tell us where to look in the past for the conditions that will repeat during> 2012.> • Magnetic strength: Indicates the overall strength of Earth's magnetic field> using the Virtual Axial Dipole Moment (VADM) method.13 It's important here to> focus on the numbers relative to one another. Are they very similar or very> different? Are they rising or falling?> • Solar output: Indicates the strength of the sun's radiant energy reaching> the earth, as a reading relative to an entire 90,000-year glacial cycle. It's> important here to determine whether the radiant energy is increasing or> decreasing.14> • Climate status: The effects of the changes in the magnetic strength and> solar output.15> • Civilization status: The events occurring on a civilization-wide basis> during the time of the reference date, correlated with the changes in magnetic> strength and climate.With these dates and our template in mind, we now have everything we need toknow where and how to discover what we can expect for 2012. If you're like me,you like to know where you're going before you begin your journey. Here is ahigh-level summary of the events that occurred for our three categories between13,824 B.C. and 1155 B.C.:[images/00354.jpg][images/00255.jpg]Figure 15 shows us at a glance what we can expect for the time before andimmediately following the 2012 end date. Although there are more than 12,000years between the reference dates for each of the two cycles, in general theconditions are remarkably similar. At the time of both dates, we find:> • Global magnetic-field strength was in the same general range as it is today.> • There was a sharp increase in the amount of the sun's energy reaching Earth.> • Global temperatures increased.> • Polar ice sheets melted and collapsed.> • Global sea levels rose.The strength of Earth's magnetic fields is important to note here in light ofthe growing concern that we may experience a magnetic \"flip-flop\" near the timeof the 2012 end date. Because so many of the changes we're discussing seem tohinge upon the planet's magnetic intensity, let's explore just a little moredeeply what these readings are telling us.The continuous records of Earth's magnetic fields made possible by the Antarcticice cores have confirmed a very powerful piece of information. They show thatthe overall strength of our planet's magnetic intensity must drop to a certainlevel before the field can reverse. With the brief explanation for the columnheadings of Figure 15 in mind, this \"threshold\" appears to be a reading thatregisters below 2 units on the VADM scale.If the historical patterns hold true, the numbers in Figure 15 show that we arenowhere near that threshold today. Additionally, it's unlikely that the yearsimmediately before and after 2012 will change that ... that is, unless somethinghappens that's not part of the past cycle and that we're not expecting.There are extenuating circumstances, for example, that could \"shake up\" thedelicate balance of what scientists call Earth's \"magnetic dynamo.\" If thebalance were disturbed enough, it is entirely possible that the shake-up couldthrow the fields into a dramatic decline, followed by a 180-degree reversal, orthe flip-flopping of the South and North poles. While there is no historicalreason to believe that these scenarios are on the horizon for the immediatefuture, they are often cited as possibilities in popular 2012 literature, so Imention them here.Recent discoveries regarding the way Earth's magnetic fields work suggest thatrather than a single one, there are actually multiple fields that merge(\"couple\") to create the magnetic shield that protects us from the sun'shigh-energy effects. A portion of these fields appears to originate from withinthe earth itself, while another forms in the atmosphere that surrounds theplanet.Anything that creates a disturbance large enough within the earth itself orwithin the atmosphere could potentially disturb the balance that maintains thefields. In other words, anything packing enough of a wallop could send thesystem into a tailspin. Although there are a number of scenarios that couldcause such an effect, the ones of greatest concern are among the following:> • A disruption of the fields due to the unusually strong burst of particles> from a \"super\" solar flare> • A galactic \"superwave\" of high-energy cosmic rays and radiation that bolts> through the universe every 15,000 years or soli> • A physical jolt to the planet itself from the impact of a meteor> • A physical jolt to the planet from inside the earth itself, such as the one> we felt from the 2004 tsunami that affected the wobble of Earth's orbit> • The effects of a \"near miss\" from a large orbiting body such as an asteroid,> comet, or planet> • The push/pull effect of Earth's crossing of the galaxy's equatorAlthough these descriptions are simplified, they are enough to serve as a caveatabout the possibility of a polar reversal in the 2012 window. They certainlysound ominous; however, the geological record that describes the same crossingof the Milky Way's equator during the last close of the precessional cycle26,000 years ago gives us no reason to suspect that we will see any of theseevents happening immediately before or after the actual year 2012.Time Code 17: There is nothing in the geological record to suggest that Earth'smagnetic fields will reverse before or immediately following the 2012 cycle enddate.It's important to bear in mind that the world-age transition marked by 2012 is aprocess rather than an event. And it's one that is already well under way.According to the calculations described by John Major Jenkins (see theIntroduction), Earth slipped into the zone of alignment that marks the cycle'send somewhere around 1980. This means that not only is the alignment alreadyhappening, but so are its effects-ones that we're experiencing as extremes inrainfall and temperature, as well as hurricanes, forest fires, and drought incertain places of the world. This tells us that we've been dealing with the mostcontroversial effects of the shift for nearly 30 years, and doing sosuccessfully.The bottom line to what the historical records seem to show is that while thestrength of the magnetic fields has definitely declined, it appears that bydoing so, they are now in the same place that they've been at this time in pastcycles-low enough to trigger the changes in climate and life, yet high enough toprevent them from going into a full reversal. In other words, the fields arejust where they need to be, at just the right point in time, to close one worldage and begin the next.Time Code 18: The Time Code template shows that the human, Earth, and celestialconditions of today are in the same range as the key reference dates of thepast. In other words, the changes happening now are just what we'd expect forthe end of a world age.Details for the 2012 Seed Dates of 1155 B.C. and 13,824 B.C.Figure 15 gives us the opportunity to compare where we are in the world-agecycle today to the fractal dates for two cycles in the past. The followingdiscussion provides a level of detail that we don't see in the chart. This isespecially true when it comes to the human events of 1155 B.C. and what we canexpect to see during the 2012 cycle. The findings are discussed in the sameorder as they're listed in the template described earlier in this chapter.Human EventsThe year 13,824 B.C., is before the time of \"civilization\" and large populationsorganized into nations recognized by scholars today. For this reason, we have noindications of how the changes affected human populations that may have existedduring this time.The year 1155 B.C., however, was pivotal for one of the greatest civilizationsknown in the history of our species: the superpower of Egypt. As shown in detailin the paragraphs that follow, it was in that year that many of the systems thatwere needed to maintain such a world power failed, and it was the convergence ofso many failures that led to the collapse of the civilization. These eventshappened within the single year that is the fractal of the entire world age.They also appear to be repeating in large part during the 2012 window that leadsto the end of the same world age.> - As with any world power, much of the civilization and government depended> upon the way in which the empire was ruled. Egypt's last great pharaoh, Ramses> III, died in c. 1155 B.C. (possibly due to smallpox). His death and the chaos> that followed began the decline of Egypt's 20th Dynasty. The Egyptian decline> is attributed to a number of different factors that seemed to contribute to a> prolonged war to fight off foreign invaders during this time.These factors include the heavy costs of war itself and the depletion of Egypt'sfinancial resources to fund it. Egyptian scholars also find accounts of thefirst recorded labor strikes during this time, possibly linked to food shortagesdue to abrupt changes in climate and the crop damage from natural disasters,including volcanic ash believed to be from an eruption of Iceland's Mount Hekla.As we near the end of the present great cycle, in many ways it appears that weare following the dangerous pattern that we see in 1155 B.C. The changingclimate and competition for dwindling resources, headed by the shortages of oiland food, has led to the violent competition that sparked many of the wars inthe late 20th, and now in the early 21st, century. Recognizing this pattern andknowing where it led before brings us to a question today: will we learn fromthe cycles of our past and avoid falling into the ancient trap that pits usagainst one another at the end of our cycle? Time will reveal the answer.Earth EventsAs we saw previously, the strength of Earth's magnetic fields is the foundationfor many of the systems that we depend upon to sustain life. The readings forglobal magnetic strength summarized in Figure 15 are based on two studies, bothusing the same method of determining past intensity,\" both essentially tellingthe same story.For the year 1155 B.C., they show a magnetic intensity in the range of 10.5 onthe VADM scale; and for the year 13,824 B.C., the readings range from 5.25 to7.25 on the same scale. These readings suggest that the present magneticintensity of approximately 7.5 is right in line with what we would expect forwhere we are in the great cycle.> - The global temperature readings in the summary are from the Vostok Antarctic> ice samples, the results of which were published in 1999. Both cores used in> the study reveal the same trend. In 1155 B.C., there was a global warming that> averaged approximately 1 degree Celsius (C), while the warming indicated for> 13,824 B.C. was twice that, at about 2 degrees C. In general, it appears that> the rise in global temperatures that we see today is precisely in the range of> those that have occurred in the past at such key points in the cycle.> - The same studies used to determine global temperatures from the Antarctic> ice cores also correlate those temperatures with the polar ice conditions at> the core locations. The results for both the 1155 B.C. and 13,824 B.C. dates> show the same trend of melting at the poles. The data seem to support what we> intuitively know about the relationship between temperatures and ice: when> Earth's temperature increases, the volume of ice decreases proportionally.> This appears to be precisely the pattern that we are seeing in the early 21st> century, with the breakup of the South Pole's ice sheet and the unprecedented> melting of the North Pole's ice pack reported by top climate researchers at> the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, in 2008.Celestial EventsBy calculating the strength of Earth's magnetic fields in the past, scientistsare now able to estimate how much of the sun's radiant energy was reaching theearth throughout the cycle. New models linking ocean temperatures with certainforms (isotopes) of oxygen (160 and 110) found in the deep-sea core samples nowprovide a continuous record of how much solar energy has reached the earth overlong periods of time.The readings are relative (expressed in terms of less or more energy) anddescribe the sun's influence for 90,000 years, about the time of one completecycle of glaciers. What's important here is that although the total amount ofradiant energy reaching Earth was lower in 13,824 B.C. than during 1155 B.C.,there was still a sharp increase for both dates. With the increased energy, acorresponding warming of the earth shows up in the ice-core records as well.Once again, this is the same pattern that we are seeing today with the declinein magnetic strength, and the same effect.The End of Time Revisited: What Can We Expect?While it's impossible to be certain exactly what the 2012 end of our world agehas in store for us, now we can know the facts about what similar cycles andseed points within them have heralded in the past. Armed with information thatour Time Code Calculator has provided, we can build a reasonable picture of whatwe can expect as we move through the 2012 end date and even beyond. We can do sowith confidence because of the clear reference dates that the Maya designed intotheir calendar.Based upon the dates indicated by the Time Code Calculator, the followingsummary describes what we can expect immediately before and after December 21,2012.The conditions for world-age reference dates of the past describe what we canexpect for the years before and immediately following the 2012 Mayan end date.They include:> • A magnetic intensity for the earth between 5.5 and 10.5 on the VADM scale.> (This places the present reading of 7.5 precisely in the range of> past-worldage measurements.)> • No indication of a 180-degree polar reversal, barring the special> circumstances described previously.> • An increase in global temperatures of 1-2 degrees C. (This places the> warming that we see today in the same range as those of world-age cycles> past.)> • A sharp increase in the amount of radiant energy that Earth receives from> the sun. (The increase that we see today follows this pattern.)> • The melting of the polar ice and a collapse of the ice caps. (The geological> record suggests that the warming we are seeing today will be quick, brief, and> followed by a period of general cooling.)With these conditions in mind, the rare alignment marked by the winter solsticeof December 2012 appears to be the cosmic marker that the ancient Maya andothers identified as the time of such great and cyclic change on Earth. But inaddition to the physical changes to the planet itself, they foretold of theemotional and spiritual transformations that the people of Earth would undergoto come to terms with the new weather, land, ocean, and climate conditions thatthe changes bring.From this perspective, our 2012 end date truly is the end of one kind of balancethat we have grown accustomed to and feel comfortable with and the beginning ofsomething brand-new. In other words, when we hear ourselves saying that we wantthings to get \"back to normal,\" we may just discover that the world created bythe changes has a new normal. The opportunity here is for us to benefit from ourindividual and collective experiences of the last 5,125 years and apply whatwe've learned as the foundation for the sixth world age of humankind.It may be no coincidence that it's only now-in the last years of the darkestpart of our cyclic journey through the heavens, just when we are faced with thegreatest threats to our future and even our survival-that we have discovered wehave the ability to cooperate with one another in a way that is unprecedented inthe history of the world. It's as if we've pushed ourselves to the very edge ofour limits and our beliefs. Now we must apply what we've learned in order tosurvive what we've created.We find ourselves living at this rare moment in time when the motion of theuniverse is converging in just the right way to give us just the rightconditions that lead to a shift in the way we think of our world and ourselves.In the same way that we would check the road signs throughout a cross-countrytrip to make sure that we're going in the right direction, 2012 is like anend-of-cycle reality check. It allows us to think about where we've been,evaluate the choices and direction of our past, and make any midcoursecorrections necessary to complete our cosmic journey successfully. Thispossibility exists only when everything we need to make such a change appears ina single window of time. The 2012 \"zone\" of alignment appears to be just such awindow.[images/00057.jpg][images/00058.jpg]\"The human race is at a unique turning point. Will we choose to create the bestof all possible worlds?\"- Scientific American (September 2005)'Once you have glimpsed the world as it might be, it is impossible to liveanymore complacent in the world as it is.'- AnonymousWhen we combine the consistent message from our ancestors for more than 5,000years with the best insights of contemporary science, the uniqueness of our timein history becomes clear. As it does, the message of 2012 makes tremendoussense. If (1) the lessening of Earth's magnetic shield allows more of the sun'senergy to create greater change, (2) the way we respond to that change is thecatalyst for our spiritual growth, and (3) both are occurring at precisely thesame time that a rare 5,000-year cycle combines with an even rarer alignmenthappening just once every 26,000 years, then it's as if the cosmos has somehowconspired to shower us with the influence of what Jose Arguelles calls the\"galactic synchronization beam.\"What a rare and precious gift! How we receive our cosmic offering is the choicethat we're making individually and collectively today. We're doing so by the waywe choose to live our lives in the presence of the greatest challenges ofrecorded human history.The world is shifting before our eyes. Faster than we can teach about it in ourtextbooks or chronicle it in documentaries, the ice caps on the poles aredisappearing; the sea levels are rising; food is disappearing; and \"superstorms\" are wiping entire communities, villages, and cities from the face of theearth. These are precisely the weather changes that Antarctic and sea-floorrecords reveal and that the predictions, prophecies, and visionaries have seenand warned us about.It's not that these things are \"about to happen\" or are \"on the horizon.\"They're happening now, and the pace is quickening. While our ancestors warnedthat our lifetime would herald precisely such events, the heart of their messagewas less about the events themselves and more about our response to them. Inother words, we were told that the changes in our world would become thecatalyst for ones within us.In the presence of dwindling resources, do we fight one another for whatremains, or do we pull together and solve the problems that confront us? Do thenations with the most money, power, and leverage use them to grab the remainingdeposits of oil, fertile valleys, and clean water, leaving others to fend forthemselves? Or do we recognize that we're a family, Earth is our home, and we'remuch stronger when we solve the problems of a changing world together than whenwe try to do so as a fragmented civilization clutching at the last vestiges ofan unsustainable way of life?We may well discover that our answer to these questions is the great secret tounderstanding 2012 and the message of our past. Our ancestors went to tremendouslengths to preserve something that they wanted us to have today. The fruit oftheir labor is scattered across the face of the earth in the temples, tombs, andmonuments that mark their legacy. Every one carries a message. As different aseach message appears to be from the others, the common thread that weavesthrough them and binds them together is that they all tell us something aboutourselves.From the Mayan calendar that reminds us of our relationship, to time's cycles tothe Buddhist message \"Reality exists only where we create a focus\"; from theChristian dictum that tells us our choices in this lifetime determine whathappens beyond this life, to the Hopi tradition that carries the instructions tomake powerful life choices ... it's clear that our ancestors worked desperatelyin their times to preserve something that they knew we would need in ours.That \"something\" is the message of renewal that comes with the dawning of a newcycle, the new world age that allows us to succeed where others have failed andto assure nothing less than the future of our species by learning from our past.Today the changing landscape of the earth is forcing us to a new way ofthinking, a new way of being, and a new way of life. Perhaps the greatestawakening that we are experiencing is the discovery of the fact that we have achoice!Will You Change It?One of the most unsettling revelations in Michael Drosnin's book The Bible Codeis a sequence of words that relate directly to the Mayan 2012 end date. Locatedwithin the coded Torah at a point linking the text to the Hebrew year 5772 (2012in the Gregorian calendar) are two ominous words that read: Earth annihilated.Without a doubt, to discover such words encoded into the Bible is a frighteningexperience. It certainly seems to play into the doomand-gloom scenarios thatsuggest we're heading toward a time of Armageddon and the end of the world. Acloser look at the code, however, reveals something quite unexpected: anothersequence of words that describes a second possibility and offers a ray of hopefor the same year.In his discussion of just what such a message maybe telling us, Drosnin firstdescribes how the words darkness and gloom intersect with the word comet andappear with the 2012 date. He then calls our attention to a curious phraselocated near the text describing the threat that seems to contradict it. Thephrase offers the welcome news of another scenario. Translated, it reads: \"Itwill be crumbled, driven out, I will tear it to pieces, 5772 [author's note:5772 is the Hebrew notation for 2012].\"l With these words, whoever or whateveris responsible for the Bible Code itself seems to be telling us that there isanother, Earth-saving outcome possible for the time when the code states: \"Earthannihilated.\" Rather than the planet being destroyed, in this scenario it's thethreat itself that will be destroyed on that date.So which is it? Does 2012 mark the end of the world or the end of the threatthat may destroy it? How can both outcomes be possible for the identical momentin time? A third phrase, found in the same proximity of the code, seems to holdthe key to this paradox and an answer our question. It's one that appears inother places throughout the Bible Code, especially when specific outcomes suchas elections, wars, and assassinations are identified. Accompanying the sequencethat describes the gravest outcome for our future are four words that offerhope, while asking the reader of the code a simple and direct question.Translated, they are: Will you change it?2Mirroring the discoveries of modern physics and the beliefs of our mostcherished spiritual traditions, these four words remind us of one of thegreatest secrets of our existence: we are part of our world rather than separatefrom it. As a part of our experience, we play a powerful role in what happens inour lives for 2012 and beyond. In fact, if we're to believe the Bible Code, ourrole is so powerful that we can even alter the course of an event identified3,000 years ago with the potential to end the world. The words Will you changeit? appear to be a direct question to those who would be certain to read theancient code maker's message. It is a question to us.It's as if whoever created the code knew that the technology to understand themessage would only become available at the time of the threat. Because we've nowdiscovered it, we're also ready to participate in the end of time to transcendthe darkest of possibilities. In this way, the Bible Code offers yet anotherexample of an ancient message that identifies 2012 as a gateway of opportunity.[images/00054.jpg]Almost universally, the darkness of our cycle is described as a brief butintense period of chaos and confusion. From the perspective of what we now knowabout our galactic alignment, this would seem to imply that the years between1980 and 2016 (the entry and exit points for the sun's zone of alignment) markthe time of the greatest intensity. Just as we've always heard that the darkestpart of the night is just before the dawn, the same traditions that carry thewarnings also tell us that our time of darkness is the very path that leads to atime of light-the increase in physical and spiritual light accompanying thecosmic orbit that brings us closer to the core of the Milky Way.It's during the darkness of the end-time that our faith, strength, beliefs, andtrue nature will be tested. One of the most important lessons of those who havelived through such cycles in the past is that the greatest challenge of such atime is to survive the darkness without succumbing to the fear that it brings.It's precisely this fear, they suggest, that destroys the world and the valueswe cherish. They believed that such a warning is necessary because this kind ofloss appears to be what has led to the collapse of civilizations in the past.New evidence of a highly advanced civilization between what is now India andPakistan, for example, places its end eerily close to the close of the lastgreat cycle, at the time when our current one began. Archaeological evidence nowdates what appear to be the remnants of the ancient, massive, and high-tech warthat destroyed the civilization at approximately 5,000 years old .3,4In light of the changes that 2012 signals for our time, maybe our greatest testwill be to find a way to adapt to them without betraying what philosopherFrancis Bacon called our fundamental character o fgoodness. That test may alsobe our greatest opportunity to respond to the stress of a changing world byhelping one another in cooperation, rather than turning against one another infear.The Hopi Path of Life\"The Prophecy says the Earth will shake three times.\"With these words, author Robert Boissiere begins describing the large-scaleevents that serve as the time markers for the Hopi prophecy of the fourth worldand the end of time. When we think of the defining events of the 20th century,the meaning of the signs is unmistakable.> First the Great War, then the Second One, when the Swastika rose above the> battlefields of Europe to end in the Rising Sun sinking in a sea of blood.'The specifics of such a verbal time map leave little doubt as to what theydescribe. There have been only two world wars in the last 5,000 years, and theassociations of Germany's swastika and Japan's rising sun have happened in onlyone of them. In the minds of Hopi elders, there is no question what thisprophecy means or where the events of the last 100 years place us in history'stimeline. Before his death in 1999 at the age of 108, for example, Chief DanEvehema, the eldest elder of the Hopi nation at that time, clarified histradition's perspective in his \"Message to Mankind\":> Now we are at the very end of our trail. We are instructed in our ancient> prophecy that this would occur. We were told that someone would try to go up> to the moon; that they would bring something back from the moon; and that> after that nature would show signs of losing its balance. Now we see that> coming about. Floods, drought, earthquakes, and great storms are occurring and> causing much suffering.The signs that were given to the Hopi people hundreds of years ago-such as thedescription of the swastika and two great warsdo, in fact, seem to point tothings that can only be attributed to 20th-century events. From the Hopiperspective, the shift into the next world is already well under way. Of thatthey are certain.What makes the prophecy especially intriguing, however, is that it doesn't tellus how the fourth world will end. Just in the way a mystery novel leaves ushanging in anticipation of the next chapter, the Hopi prophecy stops short ofdescribing how the earth will \"shake\" after the two great wars. It can't go thatfar because there's an unknown factor that prevents predicting any outcome withcertainty. We are that factor. This is where our choice comes in.Just as the Bible Code suggests that we are choosing the outcome for 2012, theHopi prophecy states that we're the ones writing the last chapter of the fourthworld story. We're doing so by the way we choose to live our lives today.Boissiere's translation states:> ... the Prophecy does not say [what the third shaking of the Earth will be].> For it depends upon which path humankind will walk: the greed, the comfort,> and the profit, or the path of love, strength, and balance.'Within this single statement, we find the Hopi message to our time in history:that while the change is inevitable, our response to it is a matter of choice.It's our choice, for example, as to how we respond to the shortage of food that\"suddenly\" appeared at a global level in 2008. It's our choice as to how we meetthe needs of those who suddenly find a lifetime of work washed away by the wavesof a record storm surge or tsunami. While the evidence shows that we are in atime of certain change, the message of our past reminds us that we're the oneswho choose how we treat one another as we respond to the change.What sets the Hopi prophecy apart from so many others is that the Hopi offer anaction plan for our time of change. The instructions as to how we choose \"love,strength, and balance\" were left to their \"eldest elders\" in a way that assuredthey would be preserved until the end of time. With those instructions we areshown the path to prepare for and accommodate the shift into the next Great Age.The Hopi Map of ChoiceAlmost universally, the creation stories describing the cycles of previousworlds explain how the collapse of one is the foundation for what comes next.From this perspective, the end of the cycle is not really the end of allendings. Clearly it's not that of the planet or all life on Earth. Rather, it'sthe end of a way of being that's a necessary step of growth and evolution.Although the ending is sometimes difficult, it's also as natural as the passingof night that becomes the new day.To ease the transition that comes with the shift between worlds, the Hopi saythe Creator gave them a life plan to share with those who would listen. Thepurpose and location of that plan is described in the prophecy itself.> [After the great flood of the third world, Spider Woman, who weaves the web> that unites all life, asked Massoua, guardian of the Earth:] \"Can the people,> the remnants of the Third World you destroyed by water come live with you?\"> He answered, \"If they pledge to live according to the life plan originally> given them by Taiowa.... Although many have forgotten [the life plan], many> will remember.... But it is written ... on the face of the rock [my> brackets].\"'The prophecy is telling us that the Creator's life plan exists as a simple mapholding a profound message, and that it's preserved on a rock face in northernArizona's Hopi village of Oraibi- a place called Prophecy Rock. What makes thismap so unusual is that that it's not a conventional one of places. Instead, it'sa map of \"being,\" of consciousness. It tells us the state of consciousnessthat's required to survive the great changes that accompany the end of our worldage.[images/00059.jpg]Figure 16. Photograph of the Hopi prophecy etched into the stone at Old Oraibi,Arizona. In it, we see the two paths that lead to the new world age of the fifthworld. (Photo used with permission, and taken by Bill Tenuto with permission ofHopi Elder Grandfather Martin on 6/4/2007. Martin used a chalk-like rock tohighlight the ancient inscriptions for the camera. For additional images andinterpretations of the Hopi prophecy, visit: http://thenewhumanity.blogspot.com)No one knows how long the images on Prophecy Rock have existed or precisely whoplaced them there. But one thing is certain: the rock's message is central tothe Hopi prophecy. Just in the way the tablets of Moses became the guidelinesfor an entire civilization, the Oraibi map holds the core of a life-affirmingphilosophy for the Hopi and all who recognize its truth. While there aremultiple layers of meaning, in general the message has remained constant.The code on Prophecy Rock centers around two parallel lines across the map, twopossible paths that humankind may choose as a way of life. Each leads to a verydifferent experience. The lower path shows people healthy and vital, living toadvanced ages and harvesting corn from an abundant field. The upper one depictspeople as well; a closer look, however, shows that their heads aren't attachedto their bodies and are floating just above their shoulders. The line beneaththem is rough and jagged.Boissiere's translation states that the upper path shows what happens with\"people who use their mind, instead of their faith in the spirit way.\" In placeof the abundant crops seen on the lower path, there are storms over a rockyterrain. To those who can read the map, its message is clear: the lower pathleads to a life of health and abundance; the upper leads to a difficult life oflack and suffering.The good news is that the map also shows a third path, a vertical line thatconnects the jagged and the smooth ones. This line is said to represent theladder of choice. It's because the ladder exists that those who have choseneither way of life in the past can change, and choose the other path. The Hopisay that as we approach the end of this world age, there will be a time ofconfusion during which many people will do just that. The conditions of theearth will move them from the comfort zone of the past and force them to choosea new path.To the Hopi, this time of confusion is seen as the period of \"purification\" thatoccurs before Earth's cleansing. Just as the intense fires that roar through aforest make way for the growth of new and healthy trees, the traditions of ourpast have prepared us for the great clearing that comes with the end of eachworld age.From their perspective, the clearing is necessary and it's inevitable. Becausewe're part of Earth's garden, it's an opportunity for us to sweep away thedebris of 5,000 years of history and embrace the best of what we've learned.With that embrace comes the opportunity to choose what we value in the new worldage and leave behind the things that have caused the pain and suffering of thepast: the judgments, biases, and beliefs that have guided our choices.If the conditions of such purification-extremes in climate, the failure ofunsustainable economies, the largest shift in wealth in the history of theearth, and the growing competition for dwindling resources-are, in fact,triggered by astronomical alignments, as the evidence indicates, then modernscience would seem to agree. The point here is that the changes do occur.They're happening now. The scientific evidence and indigenous signs suggest thatour lifetime is part of such a clearing. Luckily, clearings like this one arefew and far between.While this sounds like a good thing, the key is that before we can plant a newway of being in the garden of a new world age, we must first recognize what weneed. Following the descriptions of global signs and imbalances that have nowbecome commonplace in our world, the last part of the translation for the Hopiprophecy states: \"So it seems we now are all at this point in our lives.\"The Hopi also say that the way to choose the good path is as simple as the mapitself: \"When prayer and meditation are used rather than relying on newinventions to create more imbalance, they [the people of the Earth] will alsofind the true path.\" 9In addition, the key to staying on the path of life is equally simple: \"Givelove to all things, people, animals, plants, and mountains; for the spirit isone, if Catsinas [expressions of the spirit] are many.\"10The Hopi traditions of Oraibi are a beautiful example of a complete worldview.They inform us of where we are in the cycle through the clarity of unmistakablesigns. Then they guide us with a practice-a way of being-that is sustainable andone that we can easily follow. With that practice we are given the opportunityto choose how we experience the end of our great cycle and the transition to thenext.Choice Point 2012So what do the Hopi map, the Mayan calendar, the Bible Code, and the otherpowerful messages from our past really tell us? Is it possible that by choosinga way of being, we can actually change the way we experience things, such as thefrightening outcomes predicted for 2012? While there are a number of newdiscoveries that show us how consciousness directly affects our world, they aregenerally variations of the century-old experiment that was designed to find outhow much our beliefs really affect our reality, answering this question.[images/00060.jpg]In 1909, Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, a British physicist, devised the famous\"double-slit\" experiment and began a revolution in the way we view ourselves inthe universe. The bottom line to his investigation was that the mere presence ofconsciousness in the room people-affected the way the quantum particles (thestuff our world is made of) were behaving.On February 26, 1998, scientists at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Sciencerepeated Taylor's experiment. Not only did they confirm that our world isaffected just by being watched, but they also discovered: \"The greater theamount of 'watching,' the greater the observer's influence on what actuallytakes place.\"\" In other words, the greater the focus upon the experiment bythose present, the greater the influence their focus had upon the outcome.Herein lies the key to understanding what quantum physics and the Mayan calendarmay really be saying to us about our power in the universe. A growing number ofscientists have arrived at an inescapable conclusion: There's a place where allthings begin, and that place is the realm of quantum energy. It's the same realmthat's influenced by our thoughts, feelings, emotions, and beliefs. In this\"no-man's-land\" where all things are possible, the laws of time and space seemto break down and what scientists call \"quantum weirdness\" takes over. It's alsoin this place that the atoms of matter are influenced by thought, feeling,emotion, and belief to become the reality of our world.In 1957, Princeton University physicist Hugh Everett III carried these ideas astep further, devising the theory that describes how the focus of our awarenesscreates reality. In a landmark paper that included his many-worldsinterpretation, Everett described simple moments in time when it becomespossible to \"jump\" from one reality to another by creating a quantum bridgebetween the two already-existing possibilities.\"He called these windows of opportunity \"choice points\" and described them as thetime when conditions make it possible to begin one path of experience and thento change it by changing the focus of our awareness-our beliefs. From Everett'sperspective of choice points, chaos, suffering, and destruction are certainlypossible-and maybe even probable-if the course of human events remains on thesame trajectory that it has been set on for the last two centuries or so. Thediscovery of choice points gives us the opportunity to change that trajectory.This is good news in the face of the frightening scenarios of 2012. To thepeople who understand that the repeating patterns of a seed event also show usthe best times to change unwanted patterns, the 2012 transition appears as amixed blessing. They will be experiencing the birth of a beautiful new world,and at the same time they will be experiencing the death of everything that doesnot support that new world. While any time is a good one to make positive andlife-affirming choices in our lives, it seems as if nature is conspiring tocreate the perfect conditions that make choice and change easier: the 2012choice point of opportunity.The key is that we tend to experience those things that we most identify with.In other words, while disease and healing may both be happening at the sametime, we will feel that the healing is dominant if this is where we place ourfocus. We've all been training to do this throughout our lives. We've all hadthe blessing of families, jobs, friendships, and romance; while simultaneouslythe suffering and tragedy of the world has raged on. From World War II and theVietnam War to the more recent violence in Iraq and Afghanistan, those of us notdirectly in their midst have continued the daily routines of our lives whileothers were losing theirs in conflict. Both realities were happening at the sametime. We were also aware of both.However, in our everyday routines, when we get up in the morning and fixbreakfast to prepare for the day, we generally identify most with what our daywill bring, rather than what is happening in someone else's. This kind of focusappears to be the secret to surviving the greatest change in the history ofhumankind as well. If we can identify with the life-affirming changes locally,while doing what is in our power to help others globally, our individual choicesbecome our collective focus for whatever 2012 brings our way.Our \"Bottleneck\" of ChangeIn 2005, the journal Scientific American published a special edition entitled\"Crossroads for Planet Earth,\" which identified a number of scenarios, includingthose described throughout this book, that, if left unchecked, hold thepotential to end life as we know it on Earth today.13 Through various essays andreports, the experts present a strong case for a single, simple fact: ourcivilization cannot sustain the same path of violent competition, everexpandingeconomies, continued depletion of resources, and growing contribution togreenhouse gases and climate change that we've traveled for the last 100 years.The convergence of so many problems compressed into such a brief period of timeis what E. 0. Wilson, a Harvard University biologist, calls \"the bottleneck\" intime. Scientific American editor George Musser characterizes Wilson's bottleneckas \"a period of maximum stress on natural resources and human ingenuity.\" Thepoint the journal makes is that while each of the scenarios alone iscatastrophic, all are happening right now. And now is precisely the time of the2012 shift.Time Code 19: There is a consensus among the best minds of our time that thecurrent depletion of natural resources, exponentially growing population, globalpoverty, and competition for the necessities of life are converging toward a\"bottleneck\" in time.Even before we realized the magnitude of such problems, however, one of thegreat minds of the 20th century had already paved the way to doing so-and he didit with a warning. Recognizing that our global civilization was on a course ofexpansion, resource consumption, and vast differences of economies that were notsustainable in the long run, Albert Einstein stated the obvious in a singlesentence. \"We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking,\" he said,\"if mankind is to survive.\" We'll never know if the conditions of the world oftoday are what Einstein had in mind when he made this prophetic remark.Regardless, the sheer number of crises and the magnitude of their consequencesare clear indications that we're heading to a convergence point where somethingmust \"give.\" If they are left unchecked, our world could possibly plunge intothe time of collapse and suffering envisioned by so many prophecies andpredictions. For those living in such a time, it could very possibly seem likethe Armageddon described in biblical terms. But both the prophecies and theevidence suggest that none of these things need happen. Although the firstGarden of Eden disappeared long ago, armed with our knowledge of what world-agecycles have meant for the past, we can turn the darkest of possibilities intothe seeds of the second Eden.Because of the scientific models and ancient prophecies, we now have the wisdomto see what's before us and to recognize the possibilities. Today we recognizethe need for vast and sweeping change in our relationship to the earth, oneanother, and ourselves. We recognize that everything from the way we live eachday to how we use the resources that are disappearing before our eyes mustchange for us to survive. It's because of our ability to recognize this path ofdestruction and to acknowledge that we do have a choice that the new movementsbased in holistic, sustainable living and green industries have gained such wideacceptance.So what does all this mean for 2012? Are we headed into a time of catastrophe or1,000 years of peace? Are we looking at Armageddon, Eden, or possibly both? Thetruth is that no one knows for sure.While the solar eruptions and magnetic reversals of our past were real and ourancestors survived them before, such changes have never happened with 6.5billion people living in the world. They've certainly never happened with somany dependent upon the technology of power grids, microwave communications,computers, and global-positioning satellites. No one truly knows the full extentof the consequences; how we would deal with them; or precisely what such amonumental experience may mean to life, our emotions, and our bodies.We do know, however, that ancient humans did experience similar cycles. Whilethe biblical and oral traditions suggest that such a time is certainly notbusiness as usual, the fact is that they lived to record the story, and we'rehere to read it. New discoveries linking the physics of heart-based focus withwhat happens in the world tell us that how we experience the transition appearsto be largely up to us. The results of the discoveries are conclusive. The waywe feel about our experiences has a direct effect upon what we actuallyexperience.Time Code 20: The results are conclusive: heart-based focus and living will havea direct effect upon the way we experience 2012 and our time of change.For our rendezvous with 2012, this suggests that if we live life focused uponall of the bad that could happen, we may miss the very life experiences thatcould actually keep those things from occurring. Conversely, if we recognize ourindividual power of heart-based focus and understand how that power may bepooled into a collective wave that directly influences the life-sustainingfields of the earth, we may well discover that the hopeful descriptions of whatfollows 2012 are more than a metaphor. We will have learned that we literallyhave the power to create a beautiful new world.The key is that the only way to do so is by working together. A powerful newproject, based upon an equally powerful discovery, now paves the way for us todo just that.Linking Hearts Through Global CoherenceWhile there is a lot that we don't know about consciousness, there is one thingthat we do know for certain: it is made of energy. That energy includesmagnetism. While we can explore the magnetic nature of consciousness for anotherhundred years and still not solve all of its mysteries, we can apply what we'velearned so far to help us meet the conditions of a changing world. A growingbody of evidence now suggests that Earth's magnetic field plays a powerful rolein connecting us with one another, as well as the planet.In September 2001, two geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES)orbiting the Earth detected a rise in global magnetism that forever changed theway scientists view our world and us. The GOES-8 and GOES-10 each showed apowerful spike of Earth's magnetic-field strength in the readings they broadcastevery 30 minutes. It was the magnitude of the spikes and the time they occurredthat first called them to the scientists' attention.From a location of about 22,300 miles above the equator, GOES-8 detected thefirst surge, followed by an upward trend in the readings that topped out atnearly 50 units (nanoteslas) higher than any that had been typical for the sametime previously. The time was 9 A.M. eastern standard time, 15 minutes after thefirst plane hit the World Trade Center and about 15 minutes before the secondimpact.The correlation between the events and the readings was uncanny. And it wasundeniable. In light of the data, two questions had to be asked: Were theattacks on the World Trade Center and the satellite readings actually related?If so, what was the link? It's the answer to the second question that sparkedthe research, and the ambitious initiative, that has followed.Subsequent studies by Princeton University and the Institute of HeartMath, aninnovative nonprofit institution formed in 1991 to pioneer research anddevelopment of heart-based technologies, have found that the correlation betweenthe GOES readings and the events of 9/11 are more than coincidences.l\" Followingthe discovery that the satellites had recorded similar spikes during events ofglobal focus in the past, such as the death of Princess Diana, the factor thatseemed to connect the readings was clear: the indications pointed to the humanheart.Specifically, it's the heart-based emotion of the world's population thatresults from such events that seems to be influencing the magnetic fields of theearth. What makes this discovery so significant is that those fields are nowlinked to everything from the stability of the climate to the peace betweennations.Among the new findings are two discoveries that give new meaning to what thesatellites showed us on September 11, 2001:> - Discovery 1: It is well documented that the human heart generates the> strongest magnetic field in the body, nearly 5,000 times stronger than that of> the brain. This field creates a doughnutshaped pattern that extends well> beyond the physical body and has been measured at distances of five to eight> feet from the physical heart. Data suggest that this field may be so large> that we end up measuring it in miles; however, it's beyond the scope of the> equipment used to detect such fields.Implication: The heart's magnetic field responds to the quality of emotion thatwe create in our lives. Just as the intuitive link between feelings and the bodyseems to suggest, positive emotions increase the physical balance of hormonesand heart rhythms, as well as mental clarity and productivity. Just asintuitively, studies show that negative emotions can influence as many as 1,400biochemical changes in the body that include hormonal imbalance, heart-rhythmchaos, mental \"fogginess,\" and poor performance.'-'> - Discovery 2: Certain layers of Earth's atmosphere, along with the earth> itself, generate what is now being called a \"symphony\" of frequencies> (between.01 and 300 hertz), some of which overlap the same ones created by the> heart in its communication with the brain. It's this apparently ancient and> almost holistic relationship between the human heart and the shield that makes> life possible on Earth that has led to a beautiful theory and the project> exploring it. In the words of HeartMath researchers, the relationship between> the human heart and Earth's magnetic field suggests that \"strong collective> emotion has a measurable impact on the earth's geomagnetic field. 1116Implication: If we can learn the language of the heart-the same one that Earth'sprotective magnetic shield recognizes and responds to-then we can participate inthe effects that the field has upon all life. This is where such afuturistic-sounding relationship becomes even more exciting. Changes in themagnetic fields that we access through our hearts have been associated withshifts that include the activity of the brain and nervous system, memory, andathletic performance; the ability of plants to create vital nutrients; humanmortality from heart conditions; and the numbers of reported cases of depressionand suicide, among others.These two discoveries have opened the door to a new era of understanding ourrelationship with the earth. From their revelations the question has shiftedfrom Is there an effect between collective emotion and the earth? to Why not? Ifa large enough portion of Earth's population were to focus the strongestmagnetic field of the human body upon one emotion in the same period of time, itmakes tremendous sense that such a focus would affect the portion of the planetthat operates in the same range of frequencies as the emotions.The relationship is clear: A change in the way we feel about ourselves and ourworld has the potential to affect the world itself. If the change is a positiveone, then the effect of the emotions that result should be positive as well.Such a change is known to create coherence between the heart and the brain, andit now appears that the effect extends into the fields that support life on ourplanet. In the words of the HeartMath researchers, \"Regulating emotions is thenext frontier in human evolution.\"\"The discovery that we may choose to create more coherence between the magneticfields of the earth and us has led to one of the most ambitious science-basedinitiatives in history. The magnitude of the project is profound, theimplications epic. In light of the challenges posed by our time in history, thisnew project, \"The Global Coherence Initiative,\" now makes it possible for anyoneto learn the heart's language of coherence.\"' In doing so, it now becomespossible for more people than ever before to participate in the changes that aretaking place on the planet.The key to the Global Coherence project is twofold:1. In partnership with internationally renowned astrophysicist and nuclearscientist Elizabeth Rauscher, Ph.D., the Institute of HeartMath is developingthe Global Coherence Monitoring System, which uses a series of newly designedsensors deployed across the earth to specifically measure the changes in themagnetosphere. The goals of this system are to measure how Earth's magneticfield affects human heart rhythms, brain activity, stress levels, and emotions.Preliminary studies, such as those involving the GOES data, suggest that sucheffects are part of a two-way relationship. This is where the second part of theinitiative comes in.2. While we know that life on Earth is affected by changes in the planet'smagnetic-field strength, the data suggest that life may actually influence thevery fields that sustain us. Part two of the Global Coherence Initiative is theambitious effort headed up by HeartMath to teach individuals how to achieve thecoherence that enhances our daily lives and how to know when we are really in acoherent state. The idea is that when a large number of people respond to apotentially destructive global event, such as a hurricane or a tsunami, with acommon emotional feeling, it can affect the quality of the common field thatconnects us.Just as the human stress experienced by a natural disaster can create anincoherent global stress wave, a positive emotional wave could create a globalcoherence wave. This perspective is supported by the research at HeartMath, aswell as other endeavors such as Princeton University's decadelong GlobalConsciousness Project. The consistent data from Princeton have providedcompelling evidence that mass human emotion creates global effects that can bedocumented through the activity of electronic devices.19To put into context precisely what such a project means and why it's important,we need look no further than our understanding of cycles and our place at theclose of a great world age. It may be no accident that the Global CoherenceInitiative is being developed now, in the first years of the 21st century. It isiiow, at the end of a world age, that experts tell us that we're facing thegreatest number and greatest magnitude of challenges in the 5,125 years ofrecorded human history.Now we are finding that some of those challenges carry the potential to foreverend life as we know it on Earth. But at precisely the same time, we arediscovering that we are born with the power to harmonize our bodies with thelife-sustaining fields of the earth in such a way that we can alleviate thepotential suffering of those challenges. The way to do so is through the silentlanguage of the heart.Time Code 21: Faced with the greatest number and magnitude of potentiallyworld-ending challenges in 5,125 years of human history, we now discover thatthe key to our transition lies in our collective feelings about the change.What a powerful, beautiful, and awesome convergence of circumstances. The way toease the 2012 world-age transition is to change the way we feel about the worldand to do so together. Could we ask for a more perfect scenario?The Global Coherence Initiative is vitally important to the health and future ofour planet. For the first time, we have the ability, the reason, and thetechnology to transcend the ideas that have separated us in the past and to worktogether to inspire millions of people to participate in a pivotal moment ofchange. At the very least, the project holds the blueprint to transcend thetraditional boundaries of geography, culture, religion, and belief to unify aglobal community around a new way of living: the heartbased choices that promoteglobal coherence.The Meaning of the Time CodesThroughout the preceding chapters, we have explored the mystery of, anddiscoveries about, our relationship to time and reality. Within each section, Ihave highlighted the ideas that help anchor its message in our minds. Followingis a summary of those ideas, offered in the order that they've appearedthroughout the book. Individually, they are interesting and will serve as areminder of the importance of each section. Collectively, they tell the story ofour relationship to time, cycles, and the mystery of 2012.Just as Appendix A describes the way an algorithm lays the foundation for acomputer's code to do its work, the keys that follow may be thought of as thecode that spells out our relationship with time in a way that's meaningful,practical, and easy to follow. As with any code, the keys are in a sequence fora reason. Simply put: just as the instructions to change the oil in a vehiclework only when they are followed in a precise order, our keys to time, cycles,and 2012 make sense only if each one is understood before moving to the next.For this reason, I invite you to consider the following sequence of the TimeCodes one at a time. Work with it until it becomes comfortable and makes senseto you. Together, these codes can become your personal guide to greet the changeof 2012 and the years beyond.The Time CodesTime Code 1: We're living the completion of a 5,125-yearlong cycle of time-aworld age-that the ancient Maya calculated would end with the winter solstice onDecember 21, 2012.Time Code 2: Our ancestors recorded their experience of the last \"end of time,\"showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the close of one world age is thebeginning of the next, and not the end of the world.Time Code 3: New discoveries show that we can think of time as an essence thatfollows the same rhythms and cycles that govern everything from particles togalaxies.Time Code 4: We can think of the things that happen in time as places withincycles-points that can be measured, calculated, and predicted.Time Code 5: If we know where we are in a cycle, then we know what to expectwhen it repeats.Time Code 6: The Time Code Calculator shows us when we can expect the conditionsof the past to repeat, not the events themselves.Time Code 7: Ancient traditions divide Earth's 25,625-year orbit through the 12constellations of the zodiac-the precession of the equinoxes-into five worldages lasting 5,125 years each.Time Code 8: The position of the earth within our galaxy creates powerfulchanges that signal the end of one world age and the beginning of the next. Theknowledge of these cyclic changes is known as the doctrine of World Ages.Time Code 9: The Vedic traditions describe an extended time of devotion,expressed in action (bhakti), that began around 1898 and lasts well beyond the2012 Mayan end date.Time Code 10: The present world age began on August 11, 3114 B.C. Its end issignaled by the rare alignment of our solar system with the core of the MilkyWay galaxy on December 21, 2012-an event that last occurred approximately 26,000years ago.Time Code 11: Nature uses a few simple, self-similar, and repeatingpatterns-fractals-to build energy and atoms into the familiar forms ofeverything from roots, rivers, and trees to rocks, mountains, and us.Time Code 12: Everything we need to understand the universe lives in thesimplicity of each piece of it.Time Code 13: Our knowledge of repeating cycles allow us to pinpoint times inthe future when we can expect to see the repeating conditions of the past.Time Code 14: The Time Code Calculator can pinpoint personal cycles of love andhurt, as well as global cycles of war and peace.Time Code 15: Patterns identified for an earlier time in history tend to repeatthemselves with greater intensity at later dates.Time Code 16: Using a template of human events, Earth events, and celestialevents gives us a consistent way to view the past as a realistic window to 2012.Time Code 17: There is nothing in the geological record to suggest that Earth'smagnetic fields will reverse before or immediately following the 2012 cycle enddate.Time Code 18: The Time Code template shows that the human, Earth, and celestialconditions of today are in the same range as the key reference dates of thepast. In other words, the changes happening now are just what we'd expect forthe end of a world age.Time Code 19: There is a consensus among the best minds of our time that thecurrent depletion of natural resources, exponentially growing population, globalpoverty, and competition for the necessities of life are converging toward a\"bottleneck\" in time.Time Code 20: The results are conclusive: Heart-based focus and heart-basedliving will have a direct effect upon the way we experience 2012 and our time ofchange.Time Code 21: Faced with the greatest number and magnitude of potentiallyworld-ending challenges in 5,125 years of human history, we now discover thatthe key to our transition lies in our collective feelings about the change.The Once-in-26,000-Years OpportunityWhen you ask the descendants of the Maya why their ancestors disappeared longago, they usually tell a story that sounds more like a plot from thescience-fiction film and television series Stargate than an indigenous history.They will begin with an account of the mysterious timekeepers who tracked thecycles of the universe with unprecedented accuracy more than a thousand yearsago. Then, for a reason that only the ancient prophet-scientists could know,they left their temples, observatories, and pyramids forever. Just asmysteriously as they appeared, they walked into the jungles of the Yucatan andreturned to wherever it was that they had come from. Regardless of what theirstory means to us today, it's clear that whoever those original Maya were, theyknew something in their time that we are just beginning to understand in ours.The key to their message is that their secret was more than the preciserepresentations of time on a slab of stone. The one element of their wisdom thatthey could not inscribe as a hieroglyphic message is precisely the piece thatgives meaning to the end of our world age today. From their viewpoint of Earthas a mirror of the cosmos, they regarded the great cycle that ends on 2012 asthe end of an incubation period, the fractal \"gestation\" of human consciousnessthat is so beautifully described by people like John Major Jenkins and JoseArguelles. As any birth is the end of the pregnancy and the beginning of newlife, the Maya viewed our emergence into a post-2012 world as the beginning of anew cycle of history, complete with all of the opportunities described in thisbook ... and more.From these perspectives, the solstice on December 21, 2012, becomes a powerfulwindow for our collective emergence into our greatest potential. Such a momentis so rare that we have been preparing for it since the end of the last worldage, and it will be another 26,000 years before the same opportunity cyclesaround again for our descendants.Time Code 22: December 21, 2012, is a rare and powerful window of opportunityfor our collective emergence into our greatest potential.The possibilities of such an emergence bring to mind the ancient accounts of theGarden of Eden, a place that once held all of the possibilities of our greatestjoys and heartfelt desires. If we're to believe the calendars, myths, andprophecies, it is just such a potential that awaits us following 2012. We couldcreate a second Eden that picks up where the first one left off.Biblical correlations do suggest, in fact, that the last time an Eden appearedupon the earth was about 5,000 years ago, at the end of the last great cycle.During that time, the planet's inhabitants had everything they needed to live inbalance with the earth, enjoying vital, healthy lives. As the choices of ourpost-Eden ancestors planted the seed events for everything that would unfold asthe cycle that followed, they set into motion the patterns that define our worldtoday. Some, such as forgiveness and peace, serve as powerful reminders of whatis possible in our lives; while others, such as betrayal and war, have becomethe great challenges that divide us as people, families, and nations.From cycles of weather to the balance of carbon dioxide between the oceans andthe atmosphere, nature shows us that a pattern will repeat until something newreplaces it. The change that accompanies the 2012 convergence of cycles is arare opportunity to wipe away the patterns that we've outgrown from the past. Atthe same time, it's also a precious choice point to set healthy, new patterns inplace for our future and the future that belongs to our children ... and totheirs.It's an undeniable fact that in the presence of the greatest challenges to ourworld, we are also changed as people. Can we recognize that the greatest threatsto our familiar way of life are really nature's \"nudge\" toward a new way ofbeing? As we witness the chaos that accompanies the perfect alignment with ourgalaxy's core, are we ready to receive the greatest gift of all: the innerchange that comes from responding to life's challenges with the cooperation andnurturing of a heart-based way of living? What instructions will we leave fromour time to those who will go through the next world age and remember us astheir ancestors?We've already answered these questions in our hearts. Now is the time for us tolive what we've chosen as we emerge from the mystery of 2012 into a new worldage. The stage is set. The choice is ours. The cosmos is waiting.[images/00061.jpg]\"Time is the substance I am made of Time is a river which sweeps me along, but Iam the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am the tiger; it is a firethat consumes me, but I am the fire.\"-Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), writer[images/00062.jpg]The Time Code Calculator is a user-friendly tool that gives us easy access tothe patterns that unfold as nature's cycles-the same patterns that govern muchof the universe and life. It allows us to peer into the timeline of history in away that in many respects mimics the vision of prophets and remote viewers.Just as such gifted seers can identify the events that are probable at a giventime, the Time Code Calculator shows us when we can expect the conditions of thepast to play out again as our present or our future. The reason the programworks is because of the nature of cycles themselves. Because they are cycles,they repeat. And because those of history are made of space and time, when thetime repeats, the conditions of the space that it carries do, also.It's important to emphasize that just as the future vision of a prophet orremote viewer is subject to change based upon what happens within the timeline,the Time Code Calculator cannot take into account the effect of consciousnessand choice. It can only show us when the conditions of the past will appearagain. The outcome depends on whether or not the conditions play out tocompletion. The choices that we make along the timeline of the cycle can createa new path and a new timeline with a new outcome. This is the beauty of knowingwhere we are in a cycle.What makes the Time Code Calculator so useful is that in addition to giving us a\"heads-up\" so we know what to expect, it also shows us when our choices ofchange have the greatest potential for success. This is where the marriage ofscience and spirituality takes on a practical application that is unlikeanything we've seen in the past.If we can use the science of cycles to find the times that are ripe for change,and if we can use the spiritual traditions of our past to trigger peaceful andlife-affirming outcomes, then we suddenly have a powerful new way to think ofourselves and our world. It's all based upon cycles and possibilities, nature'spatterns that can be known and predicted.Three Ways to Use the CalculatorOnce we begin to think of time in terms of repeating cycles, the steps to findthe key points of change become obvious. If we know (a) when the cycle begins,(b) when it ends, and (c) when the first event (seed event) that sets thepattern into motion within the cycle occurs, we can calculate the repeat pointsfor the pattern that the event establishes for the portion of the cycle thatremains. With a few simple calculations, we can use the Time Code Calculator asour window into such cycles in one of three ways: Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3.With each mode, we can answer a different question.Mode 1: When Can We Expect Something That Has Happened in the Past to HappenAgain?In this mode, we can identify a seed event in our personal or collective pastand calculate when the conditions created by it will repeat in our future. Itcan be anything-good or bad-from the great joys of love, romance, success, andpeace to the great tragedies of loss, suffering, and war.What's important here is that the seed event begins the cycle. As cycles repeatin intervals that follow the rhythms of the mysterious ratio of phi (.618), wecan apply this number to the events of the past to discover when we can expectto see the same conditions again. Whether the cycle lasts for a moment or forthousands of years, because it is a cycle the conditions that it carries willrepeat within the larger one that spawned it-our present world age of 5,125years.Mode 2: What Date in the Past Holds the Conditions We Can Expect for the Future?In this mode, we can identify a key event in our personal or collective futureand look back into the past to find the last time the same conditions existed inthe cycle. Chapter 6 illustrates this by using the Time Code Calculator toidentify what we can realistically expect for 2012. By using the phi ratiodescribed previously in Mode 1, we can pinpoint a concrete date in our past thatis the seed for what we can expect in 2012.The principles of cycles and time appear to be universal. For this reason, theyapply to the things that happen in our personal lives as well as what occurs ona global scale. Mode 3 of the Time Code Calculator is a powerful aid to help usidentify precisely such cycles and when we can expect the conditions that weexperienced at one point in our lives to repeat at a later time.For ease of reading in the main text, I placed the explanations and calculationsfor Mode 1 and Mode 2 in this section of the appendices. The calculations andapplication of Mode 3 are a little different-they aren't dealing with vastcycles of time like 5,000year world ages. Instead, they are designed to findpatterns that occur within the 100 or so years of a human lifetime. Because thecalculations are briefer and simpler, and because many readers will want toapply them immediately to their own lives, I have left them in the text ofChapter 5. It's there that you will find the reasons for discovering personalcycles and instructions that describe how to use Time Code Calculator Mode 3.With these things in mind, a brief explanation of Mode 3 follows.Mode 3: When Can We Expect the Conditions of a Personal Experience, EitherPositive or Negative, to Repeat in Our Lives?In Mode 3, we can calculate the times in our lives for the repeating conditionsof an emotional experience that left a powerful imprint in our hearts. Theconditions can range from the elation of an accomplishment to the hurt from aloss. The key in this mode is that the experiences that create the greatestmagnitude of feeling tend to become the seed events for similar conditions, andsimilar patterns, to repeat at cyclic intervals. From our greatest loves to ourdeepest hurts, the experiences from one time in life impact other relationshipsafter the seed is planted in ways that are amazing to see.Building the Time Code ProgramsThe word program suggests that the calculations made by the Time Code Calculatorare part of an automated system, a piece of software that makes everything easyand does all of the mathematics for us. And they are. While an automated anduser-friendly version of the Time Code Calculator is available for your use onmy Website (www.greggbraden.com), the calculations themselves are easy and maybe done with a simple household calculator.Just as any computer program may be described using an algorithm (thestep-by-step procedure that tells the programmer how to build the software), so,too, can the Time Code Calculator. In the following sections, you will find:> • Step-by-step instructions (an algorithm) for each mode in words> • The instructions applied to actual examples discussed in the book, such as> the events of September 11, 2001, which are described in Chapter 1Note 1: Conversion to absolute dates. For ease of use, the \"modern\" dates(Gregorian dates) are converted to absolute dates in terms of the cycle itself.For dates after the year 0, this conversion is accomplished by adding 3113 (thenumber of years between the beginning of the Mayan great cycle in 3114 B.c. andthe year 0) to the seed event (example for the year 2012: 3113 + 2012 = 5125).Note 2: Conversion of decimals to months. Some of the calculated dates createnumbers to the right of the decimal point. These are portions (fractions) of theyear indicated and may be converted into the corresponding month for greateraccuracy using the following formula.> • (Number to right of decimal + 12) x 100 = percent of the year> • (Percent of the year x 12) + 100 = month of the yearExample: Year 2001.8 translates to (8 + 12) x 100 = 66.66 percent of the year or(66.66 x 12) + 100 = month 7.99 or August (rounded). The key here is to think ofthe decimal that is expressed in tenths as a portion of the 12 months that arepossible. For convenience, I have included a reference chart of thedecimal-tomonth calculations for numbers 1 to 12 below:[images/00328.jpg][images/00349.jpg]Note 3: These formulas calculate zones of time that make the events possible,rather than the specific date and time that an event will take place. So in ourexample of September 11, 2001, as a repeat of the cycle that began in 1941, thecalculations show a 30-day lag between the Time Code calculation and the actualevent. The key is that the calculator clearly pinpoints the time(s) of therepeating pattern within the greater 5,125-year cycle. As the discussion ofchoice points in Chapter 7 illustrates, human choices can alter the course ofevents, even when the conditions that support those events are present. And thisfact is precisely why the Time Code Calculator is so valuable. It gives us theheadsup as to when we can expect such conditions to be present.Mode 1: When Can We Expect Something That Has Happened in the Past to HappenAgain?To answer this question, we need two pieces of information:> • Input 1: The target date in the past when an obvious pattern (the seed)> occurred> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time> - The Time Code algorithm described: Always apply these same eight steps:[images/00362.jpg][images/00355.jpg][images/00347.jpg][images/00369.jpg][images/00129.jpg][images/00345.jpg][images/00361.jpg][images/00226.jpg]> - The Time Code algorithm applied to conditions: We'll be using four examples> to demonstrate Time Code calculations for repeated conditions.Example 1-Find: When can we expect the first cyclic conditions of \"surprise\" and\"attack\" on America to repeat?> • Input 1: The target year and month in the past when the first obvious> pattern of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" upon America (the seed) occurred: 1941.12> (December 1941)> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 5,125 years[images/00329.jpg]> > > 1941.12[images/00416.jpg][images/00139.jpg][images/00207.jpg][images/00178.jpg][images/00177.jpg][images/00173.jpg][images/00182.jpg][images/00174.jpg][images/00184.jpg][images/00185.jpg][images/00193.jpg][images/00200.jpg][images/00194.jpg][images/00202.jpg]Meaning: This date translates to March 1984. The date for the destruction of KALFlight 007 and the events described in Chapter 1 occurred in September 1983,only six months earlier. The span between September 1983 and February 1984 isdocumented as one of the most tense periods of the war between the twosuperpowers. Post-Cold War documents reveal that it was precisely during thistime frame, and within 30 days of the date predicted by the Time CodeCalculator, that a preemptive nuclear strike was being planned against theUnited States.The Time Code calculations demonstrate that the plans for a surprise attack onAmerica-the first fractal of the pattern that was created in 1941-are part ofthe cyclic pattern that can be known and calculated. As described in the textand shown in the following example, the second fractal pattern occurred inSeptember 2001.Example 2-Find: Date when we can expect the second cyclic conditions of\"surprise\" and \"attack\" on America to repeat> • Input 1: The first target year following the seed of 1941 when an obvious> pattern of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" upon America (the seed) occurred: 1984.29> (March 1984)> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 5,125 years[images/00203.jpg]> > > 1984.29[images/00199.jpg][images/00208.jpg][images/00195.jpg][images/00210.jpg][images/00211.jpg][images/00284.jpg][images/00215.jpg][images/00250.jpg][images/00217.jpg][images/00218.jpg][images/00214.jpg][images/00223.jpg][images/00209.jpg][images/00314.jpg]Meaning: This date translates to March 2001. It falls well within the range ofthe time that the attack is believed to have been in the planning phase, and itis less than six months before the date that the World Trade Center and Pentagonattacks actually occurred. There is only a 1-in-61,500, or .0000162 percent,chance of determining that 2001 would be the year within the present world-agecycle of such an attack.Example 3-Find: Date when we can expect the third cyclic conditions of\"surprise\" and \"attack\" on America to repeat> • Input 1: The first target year following the seed of 1941 when an obvious> pattern of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" upon America (the seed) occurred: 2001.33> (March 2001)> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 5,125 years[images/00227.jpg]> > > 2001.33[images/00222.jpg][images/00233.jpg][images/00216.jpg][images/00235.jpg][images/00236.jpg][images/00197.jpg][images/00231.jpg][images/00240.jpg][images/00224.jpg][images/00213.jpg][images/00242.jpg][images/00243.jpg][images/00179.jpg][images/00252.jpg]Example 4-Find: Date when we can expect the fourth cyclic conditions of\"surprise\" and \"attack\" on America to repeat> • Input 1: The first target year following the seed of 1941 when an obvious> pattern of \"surprise\" and \"attack\" upon America (the seed) occurred: 2007.91> (September 2007)> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 5,125 years[images/00259.jpg]> > > 2007.91[images/00253.jpg][images/00204.jpg][images/00395.jpg][images/00262.jpg][images/00238.jpg][images/00258.jpg][images/00266.jpg][images/00254.jpg][images/00249.jpg][images/00268.jpg][images/00269.jpg][images/00239.jpg][images/00265.jpg][images/00274.jpg]Meaning: This date translates to April 2010. It is the return of the seed cycleplanted in 1941, so it also identifies the greatest opportunity to heal theconditions that led to the events of the original seed. The weeks and monthspreceding this date hold the greatest opportunity for the conscious easing oftension and creation of peace from the last repeat of 2007, until the nextreturn.Mode 2: What Date in the Past Holds the Conditions We Can Expect for a Date inthe Future?To answer this question we need two pieces of information:> • Input 1: The target date in the future that is in question> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time> - The Time Code algorithm described: Always apply these same five steps:[images/00260.jpg][images/00251.jpg][images/00276.jpg][images/00141.jpg][images/00248.jpg]> - The Time Code algorithm applied to the 2012 end date: Here's an example of> how to search backward through time for seed conditions.Example I -Find: Date in the past that holds the conditions can we expect forthe 2012 end date> • Input 1: The target date in question: 2012> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 5,125 years[images/00287.jpg]> > > 2012[images/00289.jpg][images/00288.jpg][images/00230.jpg][images/00272.jpg][images/00419.jpg][images/00273.jpg][images/00285.jpg][images/00413.jpg]Meaning: The result of this calculation is a negative number, indicating that itis a date before the time of Christ (B.C.) in the historical notation. As notedin Chapter 6, this is precisely the year that witnessed the collapse of one ofthe greatest civilizations of the past, Egypt's 20th Dynasty. The parallelsbetween the conditions of 1155 B.C. and the 2012 close of the present greatcycle are unmistakable. By applying the nature's language of cycles, the TimeCode Calculator identifies the single date in the past 5,125 years that holdsthe key to what we can expect for our near future.[images/00069.jpg][images/00070.jpg]We have seen how the cycles of time and events repeat in rhythmic intervals thatfollow the mysterious number phi (.618). Knowing this, we can apply the seedevents that posed the greatest threats to our world in the 20th century todiscover when we can expect the conditions they created to appear again. We canuse our knowledge of such conditions as a window of opportunity to avoid in thepresent the outcomes of the past.Knowing when the patterns of the last century's global wars are primed to repeatgives us the edge to avoid new conflicts based upon the old patterns. If we knowthat we're in a year when the cycle that led to World War II is repeating, forexample, then we also know that we're in the time when it is wise to use alittle extra care and sensitivity when dealing with the inevitable disagreementsthat arise between nations over resources, borders, and human rights.Using Mode 1 of the Time Code Calculator, we can identify when such a cyclebegins in order to calculate when the conditions it created will repeat in ourfuture. What's important here is that the seed event is what begins the cycle.Mode 1: When Can We Expect Something That Has Happened in the Past to HappenAgain?To answer this question we need two pieces of information:> • Input 1: The target date in the past when an obvious pattern (the seed)> occurred> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time> - The Time Code algorithm described: Always use the following eight steps:[images/00317.jpg][images/00264.jpg][images/00256.jpg][images/00228.jpg][images/00263.jpg][images/00281.jpg][images/00205.jpg][images/00206.jpg]> - The Time Code algorithm applied to key dates:

will use Mode 2 of the Time Code Calculator to pinpoint the times in the pastwhen the conditions of the 2012 end date last appeared. With these dates inmind, we can then use the template created in Chapter 6 to make a meaningfulcomparison of those times from two different cycles-the 5,125-year world-agecycle and the 25,625-year precessional cycle-to give us an idea of what we canexpect for 2012. Following the examples of Appendices A and B, the steps of theprocess are described in words, followed by the calculations themselves.Mode 2: What Date in the Past Holds the Conditions We Can Expect for the Future?To answer this question we need two pieces of information:> • Input 1: The target date in the future that is in question.> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time.> - The Time Code algorithm described: Always use the following four steps:[images/00383.jpg][images/00390.jpg][images/00400.jpg][images/00404.jpg]Example 1-Find: Date in the 5,125-year world-age cycle that holds the conditionswe can expect for the 2012 end date> • Input 1: The target date in question: 2012> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 5,125 years[images/00366.jpg]> > > 2012[images/00163.jpg]> > > 5125[images/00325.jpg][images/00168.jpg][images/00401.jpg][images/00360.jpg]Example 2-Find: Date in the 25,625-year precessional cycle that marks theconditions we can expect for the 2012 end date> • Input 1: The target date in question: 2012> • Input 2: The total length of the cycle that tells us where we are in present> time: 25,626 years[images/00343.jpg]> > > 2012[images/00350.jpg]> > > 25,625[images/00378.jpg][images/00405.jpg][images/00407.jpg][images/00160.jpg]Meaning: The results of these calculations are negative numbers, indicating thatthe dates are before the time of Christ (s.c.) in the historical notation.

Serbian astronomer Milutin Milankovitch theorized that slow changes over vastperiods of time in Earth's orbit, tilt, and wobble influence climate change on acyclic basis. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)Website's \"Astronomical Theory of Climate Change,\" hosted by the NationalClimatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, explores these relationshipsfrom a number of perspectives: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/milankovitch.html.5. New research suggests a direct link between the magnetic fields of the humanheart and those of the earth. With her late husband, William Van Bise, Ph.D.,astrophysicist and nuclear scientist Elizabeth Rauscher, Ph.D., researched anddeveloped a sensitive magnetic-field detector capable of measuring the subtlefluctuations of magnetic fields in the earth's atmosphere. Data from the GOESsatellites in 2001 demonstrated that these magnetic fields are influenced bychanges in mass human emotion. These discoveries have led to the hypothesis thatthe communication between the human heart and certain layers of the ionosphereis a two-way communication: the field influences us, and we may influence thefield. The Institute of HeartMath (founded in 1991 as a nonprofit researchorganization to explore the potential of the human heart) has initiated a globalproject to explore this relationship: the Global Coherence Initiative.

Due to itsimmense size (over 100,000 verses), translations are usually published insections, of which the classic book the Bhagavad Gita is the most recognized.The quotes that I have used come from author and researcher David HatcherChildress, referring to the translation of Charles Berlitz and his bookMysteries from Forgotten Worlds (New York: Doubleday, 1972). Childress, alifelong researcher and explorer, has amassed an impressive body of evidencesuggesting that advanced forms of technology have existed in the past, which ispresented in his book Technology of the Gods: The Incredible Sciences of theAncients (Kempton, IL: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2000).For those interested in reading sections of the Mahabharata text itself, one ofthe better translations that I have found is through the work of Pratap ChandrRoy.

It was not until early in the 20th centurythat modern scholars were able to reconcile the dates indicated by the Mayangalactic calendar with those on our modern calendar. Even today, there is stillsome controversy as to precisely when the 5,125-year cycle of the Mayan calendarbegins. After the exhaustive study described in this text, and after taking intoaccount the shifts and adjustments made by the Romans and the early Christianchurch, the date that is most widely accepted as the start of the great Mayancycle is 3114 B.C. This is the date that Jenkins references in his work and theone I use for consistency throughout this book.17. Ibid., p. xxxix.18. Ibid., p. 330.19. E. C.

Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code (New York: Anchor Books, 2003): p. 93.14. The golden ratio falls into a curious class of numbers that are related asreciprocals of one another. So while the value of Phi with a capital P is 1.618,its reciprocal is phi with a lowercase p, whose value is .618. You candemonstrate this relationship for yourself through the formula 1 = P = p.Substituting the actual values, we find that 1 = 1.618 = .618. Because of thisrelationship, phi is sometimes called the golden-ratio conjugate. For themathematical properties of Phi and phi, please see the BBC Website:http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/ A2346374.15. An irrational number is one that that cannot be expressed as a repeatingdecimal or a terminating decimal.

For information regarding the technique of Virtual Dipole Axial Moment(VADM) measurements, please read: \"Geomagnetic Field Intensity During the Last60,000 Years Based on 10Be and 36C1 from the Summit Ice Cores and 14C\" (see Note5). To give greater meaning to the charts in Chapter 6, the units of themagnetic intensity are shorthand for the reading multiplied by 1022 amperemeters (AM)2. For example, the reference date of 1155 B.C. shows the magneticstrength as 10.5 units, or 10.5 x 1022 AM2.14. Luminosity-the output of energy from the sun-is measured as a relativereading of power in terms of photon emissions. The sun's luminosity has changedthroughout history and is currently accepted as 3.839 x 1026 watts. Thehistorical readings referenced in Chapter 6 are relative to the presentluminosity. They were extracted by the author from data reported in\"Geophysical, Archaeological, and Historical Evidence Support a Solar-OutputModel for Climate Change\" (see Note 6).15. New techniques in correlating temperatures with ice core characteristicshave provided an unprecedented record of global temperatures for the last420,000 years. The data for Chapter 6 temperature comparisons is extrapolated bythe author from \"Climate and Atmospheric History of the Past 420,000 Years fromthe Vostok Ice Core, Antarctica\" (see Note 4).16.

The title of an article about the 1998 study from the Weizmann Institute ofScience in Rehovot, Israel, says it all: \"Quantum Theory Demonstrated:Observation Affects Reality.\" In terms that sound more a philosopher'shypothesis than a scientific conclusion, the paper describes how we affectreality just by watching it. Rather than being buffered from our world and thethings that make life what it is, the studies prove that we are intimatelyconnected with everything from the life inside of our bodies to the world beyondthem. Our experience of consciousness expressed as feeling and belief is doingthe connecting. In the act of simply looking at our world, the feelings andbeliefs that we have as we focus our awareness upon the particles that the worldis made of changes those particles while we're looking. E.

Hugh Everett III was the physicist who pioneered the first insights intoparallel realities and coined the \"many worlds\" theory of reality. In the 1957paper cited here, he went so far as to give a name to the places in time wherethe course of events may be changed. He called such windows of opportunitychoice points.

Website: http://www.sciam.com/sciammag/?contents=2005-09.14. The Global Consciousness Project began in 1998. At that time, a series ofrandom number generators (RNGs) were installed around the world to detectchanges in global consciousness. All of the RNGs sent their data over theInternet to a single computer located at Princeton University. The specificcorrelations between this date; the GOES satellite data; and September 11, 2001,is available online at the Website of the Boundary Institute, a nonprofitscientific research organization dedicated to the advancement of 21st-centuryscience: http://www. boundaryinstitute.org/randomness.htm.15. Studies conducted by the Institute of HeartMath confirm the biochemicalchanges in the human body in response to stress.
