The guest continued, speculating> about a time in our foreseeable future when national law would be suspended,> and martial law imposed to maintain order. In addition to such frightening> conditions, he cited the growing threat of uncontrollable diseases and the> potential of a third world war with weapons of mass destruction, all leading> to the loss of nearly two-thirds of the world's population, approximately 4> billion people, within a span of three years.> > I had certainly heard such terrifying forecasts before.

Something was different about that> night. Perhaps it was because I felt alone on the highway.

It could have been his artwork displayed on thewalls. Perhaps it was his jewelry, modestly peeking from the handcrafted boxlined with felt. More likely than not, however, it was the three children thatsurrounded him. Having no children of my own, over the years I've gotten betterat estimating the ages of those that belong to other people. The oldest with theman was nearly eight years old. Working toward the youngest, there was perhapstwo years' difference between one and the next. What beautiful children, Ithought to myself as I passed their display in the lobby of the restaurant.I had just finished a long-overdue meal with friends near a small seaside townnorth of San Francisco. Preparing to offer a workshop that would continue overthe next three days, I knew that I had been a little distant at dinner. From myvantage point at one end of the table, the conversations seemed to be happeningall around me. I had felt like an observer as the rest of the group quicklypaired off in catch-up conversation regarding careers, romance, and futureplans. I remember wondering if my choice of seating was intentional, my way ofavoiding direct participation while still enjoying the presence of oldfriendships in intimate conversation. More than once I had found myself lookingout of the tall plate-glass windows that stood between me and the tide risingunder the pier. My mind was focused on the presentation that I would make thefollowing evening. What words would I share in the opening? How would I invitean audience of mixed backgrounds and varied beliefs to follow me into an ancientmessage of life-affirming hope regarding our time in history?“Hey, how is it going?” the man with the children and jewelry said as I walkedtoward him. The unexpected greeting of a stranger jolted me into the present. Ismiled and nodded.“Great,” I replied, without even thinking. “It looks like you have some goodhelpers,” I said, gesturing toward his three children. The man laughed, and as Istopped we quickly found ourselves in conversation about his jewelry, his wife'sartwork, and their four children.“I was the midwife for each of my children,” he said. “I was the first eyes thatthey saw when they came into this world. My hands were the first hands thattouched their bodies.” His eyes sparkled as he described how his family hadgrown. Within a matter of moments, this man whom I had never met before begandescribing the miracle of birth that he and his wife had experienced four timestogether. I was quickly moved by his trust and the sincerity of his voice as heshared intimate details of each birth.“It's easy to bring a baby into this world,” he said.Easy for you to say, I thought to myself. What would your wife say if I were toask her about having babies? Just as I had the thought, a woman appeared fromdown the hallway. Immediately I knew that she and the man were together. Theywere one of those couples that just look as though they are part of one another.She walked up to us and smiled warmly as she slipped her arm around her husband.I would have passed her display down the hallway if I had not stopped to speakwith her husband first. Knowing the answer to the question that I was about toask, I spoke first.“Are you the mother of these beautiful children?”The pride in her eyes gave away her answer, even before the words left hermouth. “Yes, I am,” she replied. “I'm the mother to all five of them.” With thewide grin that comes from the privilege of sharing years with another person,she laughed and poked her husband in the arm. I caught on immediately. She wasreferring to him as the fifth child. She held in her arms the fourth andyoungest, a small boy perhaps two years old. As he squirmed, his mother placedhim feet-first on the tiled floor of the restaurant entryway. He stepped to hisfather, who picked him up in a single motion and cradled him in the crook of onearm. The young boy seated himself upright so he could look directly into hisfather's eyes, and he remained that way for the rest of our conversation. It wasobviously something that they had done many times before.“So, it is easy to have a child?” I said, as a reminder of where we had left ourconversation before the man's wife had appeared.“Usually,” he replied. “When they are ready, there is not much stopping them.They just shoot right out!” With his youngest son still in his arms, the manstooped a little to mimic an athlete catching a ball, or a baby in his arms.We all laughed as he and his wife looked at each other. Then an air of stillnesscame over the couple as well as their children. Now and then someone crosses ourpath in precisely the right moment, with precisely the right words to jolt ourmemories and awaken possibilities that lie sleeping within each of us. I believethat, on unspoken levels, we work together in this way. In the innocence of theunexpected, a magical moment unfolds. I knew that this was one of those moments.The man looked directly at me. The expression on his face and the feeling in myheart told me that whatever was about to happen was the reason we were togetherin that moment.“Usually there are no problems,” the man continued. “Once in a while, though,something happens. Something goes wrong.”Looking at the young boy in his arms, the man drew the child even closer as hereached up and brushed the hair off the boy's forehead with his hand. For aninstant the two gazed into each other's eyes. I was honored by their ability toshare their love without making me feel like an observer. They were allowing meto participate in their moment.“It happened with this one,” the man continued. “We had some problems withJosh.” I listened carefully as he continued. “Everything was going fine, justthe way it should. My wife's water had broken and her labor had progressed tothe point where we found ourselves having our fourth home birth. Josh was in thebirth canal when suddenly everything stopped. He just stopped coming. I knewthat something was wrong. For some reason I thought back to a police operationsmanual that I had read years earlier. There was a chapter on emergency births,with one section dedicated to possible complications. My mind raced to thatsection. Isn't it funny how just the right things seem to come to our minds atjust the right moment?” He laughed a nervous laugh as his wife stepped closer.Placing her arm around her husband and her youngest child, I knew that they weresharing an experience that had brought the three of them together through a rarebond of intimacy and wonder.“The manual said that every once in a while during birth, the baby may becomelodged against the mother's tailbone. Sometimes it's the head, sometimes theshoulder, that gets wedged. It's a relatively simple procedure to reach insideand free the child. This is just what I believed was happening to Josh.“I reached inside my wife, and the most amazing thing happened. I found hertailbone, moved my hand upward a little bit, and sure enough, I felt Josh'sshoulder blade, lodged up against the bone. Just as I was about to shift himmyself, I felt a movement. It took a moment for me to realize what washappening. It was Josh's hand. He was reaching up toward his mother's tailboneto free himself ! As his arm brushed my hand, I was given an experience that Ibelieve very few fathers have ever had.” By this time, we were all in tears.“The story isn't over yet,” the man's wife said softly. “Go ahead, tell therest,” she whispered encouragingly to her husband.“I'm getting to that part.” He grinned as he wiped his eyes with his hands. “Ashis arm brushed my hand, Josh stopped moving, just for a couple of seconds. Ibelieve he was trying to understand what he had found. Then I felt him again.This time he was not reaching up to free himself from his mother's tailbone.This time he was reaching for me! I felt his tiny hand move across my fingers.His touch was uncertain at first, as if he were exploring. In just a matter ofseconds there was a strength in his grip. I felt my unborn son reach out andwrap his fingers around mine confidently, as if he knew me! In that moment Iknew that Josh would be okay. Together, the three of us worked to bring Joshinto this world, and here he is today.” We all looked at the little boy in hisfather's arms. Noticing all eyes on him, Josh nestled his face into his father'sshoulder.“He's still a little shy,” the man said with a laugh.“I can see why he's so drawn to you,” I said. “You two have quite a historytogether.”We looked at one another through the tears that had welled up in each of oureyes. I remember the feeling of awe and wonder, and perhaps a little surprise,at the intensity of what we had just shared. We all laughed, easing theawkwardness of the moment without detracting from the power of what had beenshared. After a few more words and many warm hugs, we said good night.I never saw the family again. Now, nearly three years later, I don't even knowtheir names. What remains is their story, their openness and willingness toshare an intimate moment of their lives. Their honesty had touched somethingvery ancient, deep within me. Though we had known one another less than twentyminutes, the three of us had created a powerful memory that I would share manytimes over the next months. It was one of those moments when there is no needfor explanation. We did not even try."},{"pageContent":"THE SHIFT OF THE AGESA well-known phrase in the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, considered thefather of alchemy, suggests that the experiences of our daily lives, such as thebirth of a new life, are reflections of events occurring on a much larger scalein the cosmos. With eloquent simplicity, the tenet simply states, “As above, sobelow.” Chaos theory, a specialized study of mathematics, carries theexplanation one step further, suggesting that our experiences are holographic aswell. In a holographic world, the experience of one element is mirrored by everyother element throughout the rest of the system. To the degree that our cosmosworks this way, the tenet may also be applied to an experience much closer tohome: the relationship between our bodies and our earth. As the family standingwith me shared the memories of birthing their youngest member, I found myselfthinking back to the tenet of Hermes. Suddenly the story of Josh making his wayinto our world became a powerful analogy to our planet giving birth to a newworld. The similarities are compelling.For just one moment, if we could imagine ourselves coming to earth from a worldwhere the miracle of birth was an unfamiliar experience, the story of Joshoffers a new perspective to the events of our time. Witnessing a life emerginginto this world by any account is a magical experience. Knowing what the outcomeof the labor will be, however, in some way must change our feelings regardingthe experience. How would our perspective be different if we did not know theoutcome? What if we viewed the process of labor without the privilege ofunderstanding that a new life was being invited into our midst?We would begin by seeing a woman in obvious pain. Her face would grimace,synchronized with the screams of labor. Blood and fluids would flow from herbody. For all intents and purposes, as witnesses to the labor of new life, wewould see precisely the same symptoms that often accompany the loss of life inour world. How would we ever know that from the outward symptoms of pain a birthwould emerge? Is it possible that we are making the same assumptions regardingthe labor of a new earth that someone unfamiliar with labor might make watchinga human birth? This is precisely the scenario that ancient traditions suggest isunfolding; we are witnesses to the cyclic birth of a new world. In the propheticvisions of the Gospel of Matthew, the author actually uses birth as a metaphorto describe the events that the people of our time may expect to see: “Therewill be famines and earthquakes from place to place. All these things are thebeginnings of the labor pains.”1 [index_split_085.html#filepos494960]During the last quarter of the twentieth century, scientists in fact havedocumented unprecedented events for which there appear to be no points ofcomparison. From the innermost regions of earth's cores to the very edges of ourknown universe, instruments are recording events that exceed previousmeasurements in strength and duration, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.In the autumn of 1997, reports of catastrophic earth and social changes began toflood the World Wide Web, magazines, and other media relating to such topics.The articles described a variety of events ranging from mega-earthquakes, risesin sea level, and near collisions with asteroids, to powerful new viruses andthe breakdown of a fragile peace in the Middle East, each with the potential towreak havoc and destruction. Many of the articles describe phenomena that followpredictions envisioned thousands of years ago for this time in history. Ancientas well as modern prophecies suggest that the events of 1997 marked thebeginning of a rare period in which we may expect to see some dramatic changes."},{"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF CHANGEIt was the second week of July 1998. My wife and I had just returned from anextended journey comprising three weeks in Tibet and five weeks in southernPeru. Together we had led sacred journeys into some of the most pristine andisolated places remaining on Earth today. The purpose of each journey was todocument clear and relevant examples of an ancient wisdom lost to the West 1,700years ago. In journeying to remote locations where customs have been preservedfor hundreds of generations, we had the opportunity to speak with those livingthe practices today. Rather than speculating about the validity of faded texts,or translating lost languages from temple walls, we spoke to the monks, shamans,and nuns of those regions directly. Through guides, interpreters, and our ownlanguage skills, we asked specific questions regarding the practices that wewere privileged to witness.Though we had watched news broadcasts whenever possible in the larger cities,Melissa and I had been largely out of touch with the “outside world” for much ofour time away. I walked into my office just as the fax machine beeped, signalingan incoming message. Already there was a crumpled roll of fax paper cascadingonto the floor. I wondered what message could be so urgent as to greet us inthis way on our first day back.Allowing the first few pages to tumble off the machine, I picked them up andbegan to skim the papers. They were pages and pages of information gathered froma variety of scientific institutions ranging from the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration and the United States Geological Survey to majoruniversities and news services. Each page was covered with tables, graphs, andstatistics documenting unusual events that had occurred over the last fewmonths. Apparently researchers had been keeping me informed of these events, andI happened to walk into my office just as another update was arriving.The first sheets detailed a cosmic event of unprecedented proportions. OnDecember 14, 1997, astronomers detected an explosion on the edge of our knownuniverse, second in magnitude only to the primordial Big Bang. As reported inthe scientific journals nearly seven months later, researchers at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology had documented the explosion as lasting from one to twoseconds, with a luminosity equal to the rest of the entire universe.2[index_split_085.html#filepos495218] Since the original blast, additionalexplosions of similar magnitude had been detailed.Following were reports from June of 1998, when scientists had witnessed twocomets slamming into our sun, an event never seen or documented before. Theimpacts were followed within hours by a “dramatic ejection of hot gas andmagnetic energy known as coronal mass ejection (CME).”3[index_split_085.html#filepos495559] Flares of this nature are triggers formajor disturbances in the earth's magnetic field, often knocking outcommunications and power over large areas. Still fresh in the minds of manyscientists are the effects of similar disturbances in March of 1989, caused byflares that broke previous records of occurrence by 50 percent.4[index_split_085.html#filepos495929], 5 [index_split_085.html#filepos496299]The next papers detailed studies released in April of 1998 documenting what manyhad suspected regarding weather and temperature extremes in recent years. Forthe first time an international team confirmed that temperatures in the northernhemisphere have climbed higher in the last decade than during any other periodin the last six hundred years.6 [index_split_085.html#filepos496612]Furthermore, studies had disclosed that an error in satellite data had confusedthe reading of weather trends in the past by masking the signs of increasing airtemperatures.7 [index_split_085.html#filepos496951] Assuming a similar increasein the southern hemisphere, scientists from the National Snow and Ice DataCenter were still in awe at how quickly a 200-square-kilometer (approximately124 square miles) mass of the Larsen-B ice shelf had broken off from Antarcticaand disappeared from satellite photographs. Appearing intact on February 15, itwas gone eleven days later, submerged under the water. The report stated aconcern that the entire Larsen-B shelf, covering more than 10,000 squarekilometers (approximately 6,200 square miles) could “crumble in as little as oneto two years.”8 [index_split_085.html#filepos497335] Additional studies went onto explain the significance of such events, calculating that “a collapse ofAntarctic ice could raise sea levels by 6 meters (nearly nineteen and one-halffeet).”9 [index_split_085.html#filepos497662]Beginning in early 1997, an anomalous weather pattern known as El Niño hadwreaked havoc on crops, industry, and the lives of hundreds of thousands ofpeople on a global scale. The summaries noted that more than 16,000 people haddied worldwide and that damage estimates were running as high as $50 billion.Conventional climate models completely missed predicting this pattern, whichresulted from a breakdown and reversal of ocean currents, until it had alreadybegun.Additional papers noted the 1991 discovery of mysterious new signals originatingfrom the center of our galaxy,10 [index_split_085.html#filepos497986] andconfirmed that Earth's magnetic North Pole has now wandered over five degreessince 1949–50.11 [index_split_085.html#filepos498290], 12[index_split_085.html#filepos498648] Accompanying the articles were commentariesfrom leading researchers regarding both the acceleration and rising intensity ofthe phenomena. Events from years past that many had viewed as isolated andanomalous, such as the solar flares in the late 1980s, were now viewed asstepping-stones paving the way to these recent displays of even greaterextremes. All had occurred within a nine-year window of time! Though notsurprised, I was in awe of the number and timing of the events. Many researcherssuspect that the rare physical shifts may represent the beginning of thecatastrophic cycle of change predicted in so many traditions and prophecies.At first glance, without a framework within which to view such reports, they mayappear frightening at best. The variety of events occurring so closely in timeseems more than merely chance or coincidence. Any one of these events in itselfwarrants the attention of leading scientists and governments. The fact that manyoccurred within a few short weeks suggests that another scenario may beunfolding that is not accounted for by our models of society and nature.Many scholars, modern-day prophets, and laypeople believe that such powerfulexamples of natural and social extremes are in fact the precursors of eventsfulfilling long-standing prophecies of war and destruction. The same propheciesconsidered in their entirety, however, offer a message of very different kind.Far from terrifying, ancient predictions viewed through the eyes of new researchoffer an empowering perspective of hope and possibility."},{"pageContent":"HISTORY POINTS TO NOWI had been on hold only moments when I heard the technician's voice come ontothe telephone.“We'll begin the program in three minutes, with a station ID at twenty and halfpast the hour,” he said.Radio has always been a good medium for me. Still, there was a familiar wave ofemotion that rolled through my body as I heard the man's voice. I knew that overthe next three hours, each word that I spoke would be heard on syndicatedstations across the country. For months, sometimes years, I would be quoted withregard to specific statements that I would make on this night. At the same time,I knew that the message of possibility within the interview would offer aperspective of hope for those listening. I took a deep breath to focus andprepare myself. The program was live and unrehearsed. My immediate thought was,What will the first question be?As if he had heard my thought, the technician suddenly came back on the line.“We would like to begin by addressing your optimism. In the face of so manypredictions of catastrophic destruction for the end of the millennium, why areyou so positive about the future of our world?”“Good,” I replied. “I see we will begin with the easy questions first.”Together we laughed, easing any last-minute tensions. Moments later the voice ofour program's host began a live interview. Quickly our conversation led toquestions from random callers regarding challenges that could be expected as wetransition through the turn of the millennium into the twenty-first century.Though the words varied, there was a common theme underlying each question:concern about destructive changes for the peoples of the earth. Some of thecallers' voices quivered as they shared cultural insights and personal visionsfor the end of the century. One Native American elder from an unspecified tribedescribed specific earth changes that his ancestors said would mark the last ofthree “great shakings” upon the earth. They included earthquakes, alterations inweather patterns, and the collapse of certain forms of government. From hispeople's perspective, the changes prophesied had already begun.I listened carefully. To the best of my knowledge, each caller was accurate withregard to the predictions, detailing prophecies precisely the way I had heardthem as well. At the same time the stories were incomplete. In the visions ofthose who have come before us, an outcome of catastrophic destruction was onlyone of the possibilities they saw for our future. Many prophecies also indicateanother outcome. Additional futures of joy and hope, however, appear to be thevisions that have become clouded, or lost altogether, as the prophecies havepassed from generation to generation.Our program continued into the early hours of the next morning. The moderatorand I carefully pieced together a framework within which the extremes of naturaland social phenomena began to make sense. I described a lost series ofrevelations recently discovered in pre-Christian texts. Supported through newresearch validating such traditions, the source of my optimism soon becameclear. While our challenges may appear more formidable with each passing day, myfaith in our collective ability to become more than the events that challenge ushas only become stronger."},{"pageContent":"WINDOW TO THE INNER WORLDSTo many researchers, recent extremes documented in our solar system, weatherpatterns, geophysical shifts, and social patterns have no frame of reference inWestern models of understanding. Their training asks them to view the anomalousevents witnessed by science as discrete, nonrelated phenomena—mysteries withoutcontext. Ancient and indigenous traditions such as those of the native North andSouth Americans, the Tibetans, and the Qumran communities of the Dead Sea,however, offer a framework that allows us to make sense of the apparent chaos inour world. These teachings provide a unified view of creation, reminding us thatour bodies are made of the same materials as our earth—nothing more and nothingless.Perhaps the ancient Essenes, the mysterious authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls,provide some of the clearest insights into our relationship with our world andthe sciences of time and prophecy. Supported by modern research, those2,500-year-old texts suggest that events observed in the world around us mirrorthe development of beliefs within us. Fourth-century documents preserved in theprivate Vatican libraries, for example, offer details of this relationship,reminding us that “the spirit of the Son of Man was created from the spirit ofthe Heavenly Father, and his body from the body of the Earthly Mother. Man isthe Son of the Earthly Mother, and from her did the Son of Man receive his wholebody. You are one with the earthly mother; she is in you and you in her …” (myemphasis).13 [index_split_085.html#filepos499036]In the only words that they knew, the Essenes remind us of a relationship thatmodern sciences have now confirmed. The air in our lungs is the same air thatglides over the greatest oceans and rushes through the highest mountain passes.The water that makes up 98 percent of the blood in our veins is the same waterthat was once the great oceans and the mountain streams. Through the writings ofanother time, the Essenes invite us to view ourselves as one with the earth,rather than separate from it. From such an ancient worldview, we are offered twokey precepts to guide us through the greatest challenges of our modern time.First, we are reminded that imbalances imposed upon the earth are mirrored asconditions within our bodies. Such traditions view the breakdown of our immunesystems and cancerous growths in our bodies, for example, as the innerexpression of a collective breakdown that prevents our outer world from givingus life.Second, this line of thinking invites us to consider earthquakes, volcaniceruptions, and weather patterns as mirrors of great change occurring withinhuman consciousness. Clearly, from such a worldview, life becomes much more thana group of daily experiences occurring on a random basis. The events of ourworld are living barometers showing us our progress on a journey that began longago. As we look to our relationships within the patterns of societies andnature, we are actually witnessing changes within ourselves. These holisticperspectives suggest that world changes offer a rare opportunity to gauge theconsequences of our choices, beliefs, and values in a dramatic fashion, as afeedback mechanism of sorts. Once the mechanism is recognized, we awaken to newpossibilities of even greater choices in our lives.Such possibilities of healing have been silently held in tribal traditions andpre-Christian prophecy for hundreds of generations. Through the eyes of thosewho have come before us, our timetable appears to be intact; the time of thegreat change is now. If our outer world does in fact mirror our beliefs andvalues, is it possible to end the pain and suffering of earth through choices ofcompassion and peace made in our lives? At present, the scenarios of melting icecaps, dangerously rising sea levels, a worldwide increase in earthquakeactivity, and a third world war are just beginning. Carried to its fullestexpression, each of these scenarios may be regarded as a serious threat to thevery survival of humankind. Our message of hope is that they have not yet cometo completion. The key to addressing such events is in the timing: the sooner werecognize our relationship with the world around us, the sooner we willrecognize our inner choices of peace mirrored as gentle weather patterns, thehealing of our societies, and peace between nations.We already have the evidence of a powerful technology, forgotten long ago,hidden deep within our collective memories. We see the evidence of ourfeeling-based technology each day in the joy of new life and lasting love, aswell as the conditions that take our joy away from us. It is this inner sciencethat empowers us to transcend with grace the destructive prophecies of futuretime and the challenges of life. In our collective wisdom lies the opportunityfor a new era of peace, unity, and global cooperation unprecedented in humanhistory."},{"pageContent":"QUANTUM PROPHECY IN THE DAYS OF HOPEDeveloped in the early twentieth century, the science of quantum physics offersprinciples that allow for time, prayer, and our future to be closely related inways that we are just beginning to understand. Among the intriguing propertiesof quantum theory we find the existence of many outcomes for a given moment intime. Reminiscent of the biblical passage that “in my father's house are manymansions,” the “house” of our world is the home of many possible outcomes forthe conditions that we create in our lives. Rather than creating our reality, itmay be more accurate to say that we create the conditions into which we attractfuture outcomes, already established, into the focus of the present.The choices that we make as individuals determine which mansion, or quantumpossibility, we experience in our personal lives. As our individual choices fallinto broad categories that either affirm or deny life in our world, our manychoices merge into a single, collective response to the challenges of themoment. For example, choosing forgiveness, compassion, and peace attractsfutures that reflect such qualities. The beauty of our earlier analogy to HermesTrismegistus's “as above, so below” is that we are shown the significance ofevery choice made by each man and woman, from all walks of life, in each moment.In the absence of money or privilege, all choices carry equal strength andvalue. Clearly, navigating our course through the possibilities of life is agroup process. In a quantum world there are no hidden deeds, and each action byevery individual counts. We are here in the world that we create together.Neither ancient nor current prophecies can predict our future; we are refiningour choices in every moment! While we may appear to be on one path destined fora specific outcome, our path can change radically to produce another outcomethat is quite unexpected (within the space of only thirty minutes in our exampleof the bombings in Iraq). Predictions offer possibilities only. The physicistRichard Feynman, considered by many to be one of the greatest innovators of newthought since Albert Einstein, spoke to precisely this key of prophecy when hestated, “We do not know how to predict what will happen in a given circumstance.The only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events.”14[index_split_085.html#filepos499286]Perhaps the most empowering passages of our lost pre-Christian texts refer to anancient science known today as prayer. Regarded by many to be the root of alltechnology, prayer, which is the union of thought, feeling, and emotion,represents our opportunity to speak the language of change in our world as wellas in our bodies. Through the words of another time we are reminded of thepotential that prayer may bring into our lives. Now modern research, in thelanguage of our own science, offers the same insights.In the late 1980s, the effect of mass prayer and meditation was documentedthrough studies in major cities where the occurrence of violent crime decreasedmeasurably in the presence of continuous peace vigils held by those trained forthe purpose.15 [index_split_085.html#filepos499484] The studies eliminated thepossibility of “coincidence” stemming from natural cycles, changes in socialpolicy, or law enforcement. While a state of calm and peace was created withinthe study groups, the effects of their efforts were felt beyond the boundariesof the walls and buildings that they occupied. Through an invisible network thatappeared to penetrate the belief systems, organizations, and social strata ofthe inner cities, the choice of peace within a few individuals touched the livesof many. Clearly there was a direct, observable, and measurable effect of humanbehavior correlating with groups focused through prayer and meditation.Was the change actually created by those holding the continuous focus of peace,or did the prayer vigils demonstrate yet another possibility, carrying greatimplications, only documented thus far under laboratory conditions? If thequantum theories cited earlier are correct, then for each incident of crimeobserved in a city, another outcome already existed in that very moment: onewith an absence of crime. Researchers call such possibilities “overlays,” asthey appear to blanket one reality with the outcome of a new possibility.Are there certain kinds of prayer that call such overlays into the focus of thepresent? For this to be possible in the experiments above, for example, theoutcome of peace and the outcome of crime had to exist in the same moment, asone gave way to the focus of another. For two somethings to share the same placeat the same time is an impossibility from our way of thinking—or is it?In his recent book, Cracking the Bible Code, Jeffrey Satinover, M.D., relatesextraordinary new research offering insight into precisely such possibilities.In one of these studies, reports Satinover, two atoms of very differentproperties were documented in an act that defies the laws of nature as weunderstand them today. Under the right conditions, the two atoms were occupyingexactly the same place at precisely the same time! 16[index_split_085.html#filepos499757] Until these studies were verified, such aphenomenon had been believed to be impossible. Now we know that it is not. Theoutcome of our world at any given moment in time is made of people, machines,earth, and nature. At their most fundamental level, our outcomes are made ofatoms. If two of the basic building blocks of our world may coexist at the sameinstant, then the doorway has been opened for many atoms, resulting in manyoutcomes, to do the same. The difference may simply be one of scale.Through our refined language of quantum science, we now have the vocabulary todescribe precisely how we participate in determining the outcome of our future.Recognizing that the experiences of our lives exist as events situated along thecourse of time, the ancients remind us that to change the nature of ourexperience, we must only choose a new course. The difference between this lineof thinking and the suggestion that we create our reality by manipulating thefabric of creation is vast and, at the same time, extremely subtle.Rather than creating or imposing change upon our world, perhaps it is ourability to change our focus that was the ancient key suggested by the masters ofpassive change in history. Buddha, Gandhi, Jesus of Nazareth, and those whoparticipated in the mass prayer of November 1998 each experienced the effect ofsuch change. Quantum physics suggests that by redirecting our focus— where weplace our attention —we bring a new course of events into focus while at thesame time releasing an existing course of events that may no longer serve us.Perhaps this is precisely what happened on that November evening with thecampaign against Iraq. Although achieving our political goals through militaryforce may have served us in the past, we may have reached a time when we haveoutgrown such tactics. As odd as it may sound, the past threat of mutualdestruction between powers of comparable strength has actually created one ofthe longest eras of relative peace that our world has known in recent years.Nonetheless, something changed that night in November. With a unified voice, ourglobal family chose to direct its attention toward the overlay of peace, ratherthan achieving peace through a military solution. While the thirty or socountries participating in prayer that night represent only a small fraction ofour world, the effects were powerful. On that night, no lives were lost towarplanes in Iraq. Could bringing peace into our lives be as simple as aconcerted, unified effort to focus upon peace as if it were already here?Ancient traditions ask us why we would make it any more difficult."},{"pageContent":"REWRITING OUR FUTUREThe membrane between future possibilities may be so thin that we fail torecognize when we have crossed into a new outcome. The “sudden urge,” forexample, to exercise more often, eat differently, or recommit to a flounderingrelationship represents a new choice that breaks the structure of a presentpattern and promises a new outcome. Though we may feel that the choice has beenspontaneous or natural, the change now allows us to experience a possibility ofhealth or relationship that was only a dream in the past. Prayer is the languagethat allows us to express our dreams, making them real in our lives. What if ourchoices were made intentionally?Now, perhaps more than any other time in human history, the choice of outcome isours. Once we have read the words, recognized the possibilities, and exposedourselves to new ideas, we cannot return to the innocence of the moment before.In the presence of what we have seen, we must make sense of our experience. Wemay disregard what we have been shown, citing lack of proof or too little data,or we may allow ourselves to embrace the opportunity of a new way. The momentthat we reconcile each new possibility is the moment where the magic begins; itis the moment of choice.As our world gives birth to a new earth, landmasses, weather patterns, ice caps,and magnetic shifts bear witness to the changes. In light of recent research,what is the potential of applying the wisdom of two-thousand-year-old texts on aglobal scale, to answer the challenges of the new millennium with an outcome ofhealing, peace, and graceful transition?

Sometimes the feeling of an event lasts longer thanthe event itself. This was one of those times. I played the scene over in mymind, again and again. In slow motion I could freeze-frame each act. Poisedsafely as an observer, I studied the details, searching for an answer—somethingin my knowing world to make sense of what I had just witnessed.Only moments before, I had noticed the elderly gentleman as I strolled acrossthe parking lot toward the seaside restaurant. I had seen him, and a woman Iassumed to be his wife, threading their way through a small crowd of people ontothe sidewalk in front of the reception area. Together they had just passedthrough the swinging doors into the hot, thick air of a summer night in coastalGeorgia. His stainless-steel walker preceded each step, securing a stableposition from which he could shuffle through his next movement.Suddenly the rhythm changed. Unexpectedly, he had reached a curb that droppedsix inches or so, to the surface at street level. In slow motion, I watched ashis walker rocked with uncertainty, tipped, then crashed onto the asphalt, stillhot from the relentless daytime sun. The man, confidently gripping the handlesof his companion device, crumpled into a heap on top of it. He lay theremotionless. Like a surrealistic voyeur, I stood motionless, in the street.Silent. Witnessing.The wind seemed to tease my ears, carrying away fragments of terrified screamsfrom the man's wife. “Help us! Please, someone help us!” The power of her voicebetrayed her thin, frail body.Within seconds I was there beside them in the street. As quickly as I had moved,however, I was not the first. In my silent witnessing, I had not noticed anyonenearby, nor had I seen anyone approach. Already kneeling at the fallen man'sside, however, cradling his head in her lap, was another woman. A zigzag trailof red glistened along the base of the man's head, just below his ear. Gentlyshe tilted his body in the overhead light, searching for the source of blood. Inthe faint glow of lobby lights from the restaurant, I could see the folds of hisskin, overlapping one another, hiding whatever injury was at the source of thebleeding.Carefully the woman separated each fold until she found the wound. The bloodtook on an odd color in the glare of the mercury vapor street lamp overhead. Atfirst it looked like another layer of skin. Then I could see a darker place, adeep shimmer, as she parted the fold. Without saying a word, the woman touchedthe broken tissue, then began to stroke the wound as if she were petting a tinyanimal. I looked into her face. Her eyes were closed as she tilted her headupward toward the sky. Seeing the incident from inside the restaurant, a groupof people had gathered around us. Except for an occasional whisper from someonejust arriving, not one word was spoken. The entire crowd stood motionless andquiet, as if a silent cue had been given. Later that evening, some of theonlookers said that they had sensed a kind of sacredness in that moment. Somewent so far as to suspect that a holy act was occurring.Together, we were entranced by what we saw. At first we were uncertain what washappening. While our senses suggested one thing, our logic dictated somethingelse. There, in the poorly lit parking lot of this little restaurant, Iwitnessed what modern science would consider a miracle. In full view of a dozenor so witnesses, as the woman silently stroked the tear in the man's flesh, itbegan to disappear. Within moments his wound had healed without any trace of theinjury from his fall just moments earlier.Someone in the restaurant had called 911, and the paramedics arrived withinmoments. As their flashing lights signaled their arrival, the crowd separated,allowing the attendants into the small circle where the man was still lying inthe woman's lap. Still cradling the man's head and shoulders, the woman maderoom for the EMT. We watched as he examined the bloodstains on the man's shirt.Expertly the technician traced them to the back of the fallen man's head, thento the place just below his ear. Just as the woman had done moments earlier, theparamedic carefully separated the folds of skin where blood had pooled. To theamazement of the paramedics and the awe of the onlookers, there was no wound.The blood seemed to have just appeared at a point on the elderly man's neck, runits course, and spilled onto the collar of his shirt. There was no trace ofwound, opening, or scar. Still wet on the man's skin, the blood appeared to haveno source! The questions flashed into my mind as I watched: How was thispossible? In the presence of a science so advanced that it can peer into theworld of an atom and build machines that travel to the edge of our galaxy, whydoes the same science consider the healing that I had just witnessed a miracle?"},{"pageContent":"LOST WORDSThough in Western science we have no frame of reference for such an event, itfalls well within the scope of indigenous traditions and ancient texts.Additionally, the same traditions remind us that it is now, during theconvergence of many cycles of time, that we will recognize the importance ofsuch miracles. As we witness events that are beyond the scope of acceptedscience, we rekindle the memory of a power that has lived within each of us forhundreds of generations. For nearly two millennia, our power has slept while wehave tested ourselves through the challenges of human history. The sametraditions suggest that now we will awaken our gifts to meet even greaterchallenges within our lifetime. In doing so, we open the door to anunprecedented era of peace and cooperation, while insuring a future forgenerations still to come.Why, then, are the extremes of nature and social unrest in our world today sucha mystery to Western understandings? As well as our explanations of naturalprocesses have worked thus far, could our understandings be incomplete? Is theresomething missing? Is it possible that in the recesses of our collective wisdom,we lost the knowledge that allows us to make sense out of the seeminglysenseless?The last half of the twentieth century has uncovered documents that shed lighton this frequently asked question. Centuries-old manuscripts of Aramaic,Ethiopian, Coptic Egyptian, Greek, and Latin origin support indigenoustraditions and confidently suggest that the answer to this question is “Yes!”"},{"pageContent":"FORGOTTEN TECHNOLOGYSeventeen hundred years ago, key elements of our ancient heritage were lost,relegated to the elite priesthoods and esoteric traditions of the day. In aneffort to simplify the loosely organized religious and historic traditions ofhis time, early in the fourth century A.D. the Roman emperor Constantine formeda council of historians and scholars. What would later be known as the Councilof Nice fulfilled the directive of its charter and recommended that at leasttwenty-five documents be modified or removed from the collection of texts.1[index_split_086.html#filepos500067] The committee found many of the works underconsideration to be redundant, with overlapping stories and repeated parables.Other manuscripts were so abstract and in some cases so mystical that they werebelieved to be beyond any practical value. Additionally, another twentysupporting documents were removed, held in reserve for privileged researchersand select scholars. The remaining books were condensed and rearranged, to givethem greater meaning and make them more accessible to the common reader.Each of these decisions contributed to further confusing the mystery of ourpurpose, possibilities, and relationship to one another. Following theaccomplishment of their task, the council produced a single document in A.D.325. The result of their labor remains with us as perhaps one of the mostcontroversial texts of sacred history. It is known today as the Holy Bible.Seventeen hundred years later, the implications of the Nicean Council's actionscontinue to mold the politics, social structure, religious understandings, andtechnology of our lives. Although we live in a sophisticated world based inscience, the assumptions that led to our technical achievements are firmlyrooted in our beliefs of how we relate to our world. Such understandings,developed over thousands of years, have become the very foundation of ourscience. For example, how would the petroleum technology that drives our economytoday differ if we had instead recognized the laws of harmony and powered ourmachines by simply tuning them to the seven-centimeter bandwidth of energy thatpermeates our world? Such technology is only possible in the presence of abelief system that understands the holistic laws of nature, the very tenets thatdisappeared from our sacred traditions nearly two millennia ago. Perhaps ourfailure to recognize these relationships is mirrored in a technology thatbelieves we must harness burning or exploding forms of energy to power ourworld. Such outward expressions of technology may mirror our inner sense ofseparateness.Clearly, these implications could not have been seen by the council members ofNice nearly two thousand years ago, or even by the translators of such textshundreds of years later. For example, a statement attributed to the Archbishopof Canterbury Wake suggests an innocence with respect to the Nicean edits when,asked why he chose the drudgery of translating texts rather than the creativefreedom of publishing his documents, the Archbishop replied, “Because I hopedthat such writings as these would find a more general and unprejudicedacceptance with all sorts of men than anything that could be written by anyonenow living.”2 [index_split_086.html#filepos500291] How could the council membersof the fourth century know that the book they produced would eventually becomethe basis for one of the great religions of the world?In recent years, individual documents and entire libraries lost after the deathof Christ have been recovered, translated, and made available to the generalpublic. To the best of my knowledge, there is no single compilation containingall of the information, as the translations are products of different authorsworking in different languages over the centuries. There have, however, beengroups of translations from time to time. It is through the work of modernscholars that one such compilation of lost biblical books was published earlierin the twentieth century.3 [index_split_086.html#filepos500434] Among thedocuments identified as being edited out of our modern Bible are these books:[images/00009.jpg] Below is a partial summary of supporting texts removed during the fourth-centuryedits. These texts have typically been reserved for scholars.4[index_split_086.html#filepos500555][images/00010.jpg] The consequences of removing, or in some cases altering, these forty-one books,and possibly others detailing our heritage and relationship to the cosmos,remain with us today. The absence of such key texts may explain the sense manyindividuals have expressed that our biblical records are scattered andincomplete. For serious researchers and casual historians alike, knowing theexistence of these documents offers a sense of resolution. Much like a modernmystery, it is only now, nearly two thousand years after they disappeared fromour open literature, that we may at last complete our history.While each of the lost books contributes to understanding our past, there aresome that are certainly of greater consequence than others. Among the mostsignificant are those describing the lives of the people that time has come toview as more than human in their accomplishments. The biblical Book of Mary, themother of Jesus, offers just one example. For centuries, scholars havespeculated that Mary played a much greater role in the life of Jesus than we cansee in the abbreviated descriptions of her life in our modern Bible. Through thebook created in her name, we are given insight into her heritage and the familyvalues that led Mary to her role as the mother of Jesus. In the texts thatfollow the Book of Mary, we are shown how she guided her son, instilling in himthe values that would allow his gifts of healing and prophecy to better servethe people of his world and beyond.Mary's parents, for example, were descendants of the lineage of David, one ofthe original tribes of Israel. Her father and mother, Joachim and Anna, had beenmarried approximately twenty years before they conceived their first and onlydaughter. Mary's spirit came into Anna's womb following a dream that both sheand Joachim shared from different locations, on the same evening. In thepresence of an “angel of the Lord,” they agreed to a vow that their daughterwould “be devoted to the Lord from her infancy, and be filled with the HolyGhost from her mother's womb.”5 [index_split_086.html#filepos500703] Theirdaughter's name would be Mary, and it would be through her purity that she wouldagree to a rare conception in her fourteenth year. Additional books go on todescribe the time leading up to and immediately following the birth of Jesus, aswell as previously unreported miracles performed throughout his childhood.Perhaps the Books of Adam and Eve offer some of the greatest insights into ourrole in history and our present-day beliefs. The First Book of Adam and Evebegins after the time of Creation, with a description of the location of “thegarden,” implied to be the Garden of Eden. Planted “in the east of the earth,”the garden was located “on the border of the world eastward, beyond which,toward the sun-rising, one finds nothing but water, that encompasses the wholeworld, and reaches unto the borders of heaven. And to the north of the gardenthere is a sea of water, clear and pure to the taste, like unto nothing else.”6[index_split_086.html#filepos500885]Following the time when Adam and Eve were driven from the garden, a raretimetable was given to them, describing the duration of their exile, extended toall of their descendants, until a specific moment in time. In what may be thefirst of the great prophecies, Adam and Eve are told by their Creator that hehas “ordained on this earth days and years, and thou and thy seed shall dwelland walk in it until the days and years are fulfilled.” This time of thefulfillment is envisioned following the “great five days and a half,” furtherdefined as “five thousand and five hundred years.” It would be then, at theclose of a great cycle of time, that “One would then come and save” Adam and hisdescendants.For nearly two thousand years we have speculated about the missing time andobvious gaps in the biblical records. Now the recovery of the Bible's lost bookshas shed new light, and possibly opened the door to even greater questionsregarding our understanding of the world. What we know is that, at best, ourview and interpretation of history, as well as our role in creation, areincomplete. Is it possible that the very foundation of our society and culture,our language, religion, science, technology, and even the way we love oneanother is built upon an incomplete understanding of our most sacred and ancienthistory? What have we forgotten about our relationship with the forces of ourworld that prevents us from understanding the healing that occurred in theparking lot of the restaurant that evening in Georgia? Perhaps the gap in ourunderstanding may be filled at last, in light of new revelations from a wisdomthat forms the basis for the world's major religions: the teachings of theancient Essenes."},{"pageContent":"THE MYSTERIOUS ESSENESFive hundred years before the birth of Christ, a mysterious group of scholarsformed communities to honor an ancient teaching that began before history as weknow it. Collectively known as the Essenes, these were various sects thatincluded the Nazirenes and the Ebionites. Roman and Jewish scholars referred tothe Essenes as “a race by themselves, more remarkable than any other in theworld.”7 [index_split_086.html#filepos501071] Portions of their traditions arefound in ancient writings such as the Sumerian glyphs, dating to 4000 B.C.Elements of nearly every major world belief system existing today may be tracedback to this original lineage of wisdom, including those of China, Tibet, Egypt,India, Palestine, Greece, and the American Southwest. Additionally, many of thegreat traditions of the Western world have roots in the same body ofinformation, including the Freemasons, Gnostics, Christians, and Kabalists.8[index_split_086.html#filepos501332]Also known as “the Elect” and “the Chosen Ones,” the Essenes were the firstpeople openly to condemn slavery, the use of servants, and the killing ofanimals for food. Viewing physical labor as a healing communion with the Earth,they were agriculturists, living close to the land that gave them life. TheEssenes viewed prayer as the language through which to honor nature and thecreative intelligence of the cosmos; they made no distinction between the two.They practiced prayer on a regular basis. The first prayer of the day wasoffered upon arising in the predawn darkness to work in the fields. This wasfollowed by prayers before and after each meal and again upon retiring at theend of the day. They viewed their practice of prayer as an opportunity toparticipate in the creative process of their lives, rather than as a structuredritual required throughout the day.Strict vegetarians by today's standards, members of the Essene communitiesabstained from animal flesh, blood foods, and fermented liquids. Perhaps one ofthe clearest explanations of their diet may be found in the following passagefrom the Dead Sea Scrolls: “Kill not the food which goes into your mouth. For ifyou eat living food, the same will quicken you, but if you kill your food, thedead food will kill you also. For life comes only from life, and death comesalways from death. For everything which kills your foods, kills your bodiesalso.”9 [index_split_086.html#filepos501458] Their lifestyle permitted them toreach advanced ages, attaining 120 years or more with vitality and greatendurance.The Essenes were meticulous scholars, recording and documenting their traditionsfor future generations that they could only imagine. Perhaps the best example oftheir work may be seen in the hidden libraries that they left throughout theworld. Like methodically placed time capsules, their manuscripts providesnapshots into the thinking of an ancient people and a forgotten wisdom. Whatwas their message to us today?"},{"pageContent":"SCROLLS FROM THE DEAD SEAOne of the most accessible and controversial of the Essene libraries wasdiscovered hidden among forgotten caves in the Qumran area, above the Dead Sea.Known collectively as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the documents hidden for safekeepingare believed to have numbered nearly one thousand. Following the initialdiscovery of the scrolls by Bedouin tribesmen in 1946–47, the great antiquity ofthe texts was not validated until the spring of 1948. It was during this timethat specialists at the American Schools of Oriental Research confirmed the agesof the first seven manuscripts. The Manual of Discipline, Tales of thePatriarchs, Thanksgiving Psalms, Commentary on Habakkuk, War Scroll, and Book ofIsaiah (two copies), were determined to have been written hundreds of yearsearlier than any other texts discovered to date in the Holy Land. By 1956, atotal of eleven caves had been discovered. Together, they contained the remainsof approximately eight hundred and seventy scrolls, composed of over 22,000fragments of papyrus, animal hide, and metallic rolls. One site alone, CaveNumber Four, contained approximately 15,000 fragments, the largest cache of DeadSea texts unearthed so far.The translation and publication of the scrolls has been the subject oftremendous controversy for over forty years. Until recently, access to the DeadSea library was the sole responsibility of a team consisting of eight scholars.It was not until the 1990s, as a result of political and academic pressure, thatthe contents of the scroll library from the Qumran caves were released to thepublic. In 1991, southern California's Huntington Library announced that it wasin possession of a complete set of photographs of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and thatthey would be made available to the public. Following suit, in November of thesame year, Emanuel Tov, chief of the official scroll team, announced “free andunconditional access to all the photographs of the Dead Sea Scrolls, includingpreviously unreleased scrolls.”10 [index_split_086.html#filepos501623]The ongoing controversy over the scrolls invites us to ask the same question,again and again. What message could possibly be held in a two-thousand-year-oldtext, that would warrant keeping it from the public for nearly a half-centuryafter its discovery? What could these 22,000 fragments of copper, animal hide,and papyrus possibly say that would have any impact upon our lives today?One of the reasons for the delay in publishing the scroll translations is thatthe cave scrolls appear to be the earliest versions of our modern Bible. Asexciting as such a discovery may sound initially, the problem lies in thediscrepancies between the original texts transcribed by the Essenes and thebiblical versions accepted today. The documents found in the Dead Sea caves havenot undergone the edits of the fourth-century Council of Nice, the translationsinto the languages of the West, or the interpretation of scholars over the lasttwo thousand years.Contained within the scrolls are stories, parables, and a history that has notbeen seen since they were removed from the canonized version of our Bible earlyin the fourth century. Written in Hebrew and Aramaic, the scrolls includewritings said to have come, in some cases, from the angels themselves.Additionally, the library contains rare insights into the lives of prophets suchas Enoch and Noah, and at least twelve previously unknown texts written byMoses. None of these documents is included in our Bible today. Clearly, thescrolls from the Qumran caves are just beginning to open the door to newpossibilities in our relationships to our collective past and with one another."},{"pageContent":"SECRETS OF THE ESSENESAn excerpt from the Dead Sea Scrolls offers insight into why the ancient Essenesseparated themselves from the urban areas of their time, forming their owncommunities in the desert: “Always have the children of light lived whererejoice the angels of the earthly mother: near rivers, near trees, near flowers,near the music of the birds, where sun and rain may embrace the body which isthe temple of the spirit.”11 [index_split_086.html#filepos501893] Nature andnatural laws were key to the Essene way of life. The path to understanding theirworldview may be found in their beliefs regarding the relationship between thehuman body and the elements of the earth.For the Essenes of Qumran, the word angel described the elements of our worldthat today we see as electrical and magnetic forces. Some forces were visibleand tangible, while others were etheric, though nonetheless present. Forexample, a reference to “the angel of the earth” may include the angel of theair and angels of water and light. Forces of emotion and consciousness were alsoreferred to as angels, such as the angels of joy, work, and love. Such insightsinto the thinking of the Essenes allow us to view their words 2,500 years laterwith new hope and understanding.In the language of their time, the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls offered aworldview that considers a holistic and unified relationship between the earthand our bodies. Through eloquent words and poetic reminders, the Qumran textsremind us that we are the product of a very special union, a sacred marriagebetween the soul of the heavens and the tissue of our world. The principlestates, without exception, that we are a part of, and intimately enmeshedwithin, all that we see as our world. Through unseen threads and immeasurablecords, we are a part of each expression of life. All rock, each tree andmountain, every river and ocean is a part of each of us. Perhaps most important,you and I are reminded that we are a part of one another.Essene traditions refer to this union as that of “our Mother Earth” and “ourFather in Heaven”: “For the spirit of the Son of Man was created from the spiritof the Heavenly Father, and his body from the body of the Earthly Mother. YourMother is in you, and you in her. She bore you: she gives you life. It was shewho gave to you your body…even as the body of the newborn babe is born of thewomb of his mother.”12 [index_split_086.html#filepos502070] We are thegenderless union of these forces, the masculine of “our Father in Heaven” mergedwith the feminine of “our Mother Earth.”This unified view invites us to consider that through the common thread thatbinds our bodies to the earth, the experiences of one are mirrored in the other.As long as the marriage is honored, the union between the earth and the spiritcontinues and the soft temples of our bodies live. When the agreement isdishonored, the union ends, our temple dies, and the forces of earth and spiritreturn to their respective places of origin.Essene wisdom containing such subtle concepts was among the loose collection oftexts that would become our biblical traditions of today. Those very texts,among other documents, were removed by the Nicean Council during thefourth-century edits. The elegant simplicity that weaves the great teachings ofthe Essenes into meaningful elements of our lives today was rediscovered,preserved in very good condition, in the great libraries of the royal GermanHapsburgs and the Catholic Church during the early part of the twentiethcentury. The Vatican manuscripts, held for over 1,500 years, were key in thedocuments that led Edmond Bordeaux Szekely to publish revised translations ofthe rare Essene texts. In 1928 he offered the first in a series of works thatwould become known as The Essene Gospel of Peace, offering new insights, and arenewed respect, for this lineage of wisdom that predates nearly every majorreligion of today."},{"pageContent":"THE LIBRARY OF NAG HAMMADITwo years before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, another library ofancient wisdom had already been discovered, one that would forever change theway we think of early Christianity. In the Nag Hammadi region of Upper Egypt, acollection of scrolls was found by two brothers in December of 1945. Buried in asealed jar, the texts consisted of twelve complete manuscripts and eight pagesfrom a thirteenth, each written on an ancient paper made of papyrus strips. Theentire collection of documents become known as the Nag Hammadi Library, and isnow kept in the Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt. The library of Nag Hammadi passedthrough an amazing number of hands before its volumes were recognized,authenticated, and entered into the museum register on October 4, 1946. Althoughsome of the scrolls were destroyed in their use as fuel for local ovens, theremainder survive today in a remarkable state of preservation, offering freshand, in some cases, unexpected insights into the traditions of ancient Gnosticand early Christian traditions.Dating to the fourth century A.D., the Nag Hammadi Library begins at theapproximate time that the Dead Sea Scrolls leave off. Never before have we seensuch continuity in the spiritual and religious teachings of early Christians,including their view of our time through future prophecy. The Gnostic traditionsoriginated during a time when early Christian doctrines were being reshaped andwere taking on a new identity. Gnostics identified with the central teachings ofChristianity, in their original form, and chose to separate, rather than followthe tide of change that was leading Christian traditions from the original basisof their belief. As the Roman Empire converted to conventional Christianity,Gnostic followers were first relegated to the status of a radical sect andeventually eradicated from the consideration of Christianity entirely. Bookssuch as the Gospel of Mary, the Apocalypses of Paul, James, and Adam, and theBook of Melchizedek survive today as a testament to the Gnostic wisdom ofpreserving rare teachings for future generations.THE APOCALYPSE OF ADAMBecause Gnosticism is generally acknowledged to have originated within thetraditions of early Christianity, many of the Gnostic texts have counterparts inthe stories, myths, and parables of early Christian texts. Of special note amongthe Nag Hammadi documents is a rare text known as the Apocalypse of Adam. Acollection of teachings that were divinely inspired and transmitted, this bookis the account of the Adam that we read of in the Book of Genesis. What makesthe Apocalypse of Adam so unique is the apparent absence of any relationship toearlier material. It appears that this particular text was already complete andwell established as an earlier form of Gnosticism long before the time ofChristian literature.Adam began his account by describing the presence of three visitors from heaven,guides that led him through his visions into the futures of humankind. Shortlybefore his death, he dictated his revelations to his son, Seth. Similar to theteachings of the prophet Enoch, who dictated the secrets of Creation to his son,Methuselah, at an advanced age, the texts begins with Adam teaching his son “inthe seven hundredth year.…”13 [index_split_086.html#filepos502207] Establishinga brief history of his life with Eve, Seth's mother, Adam shares his visions ofevents that are yet to occur. “Now then, my son Seth, I will reveal to you thethings which those men whom I saw before me at first revealed to me.…”14[index_split_086.html#filepos502570] Adam tells of the time of the great floodof Noah, still to come in his future, complete with accurate references toNoah's family and the ark that saves them.Perhaps the most significant in the revelations of Adam is his description of asavior whom he calls the “illuminator.” Adam tells of an earth continuouslyravaged by floods and fires until the illuminator appears for the third time.After his appearance, the great powers of the world question his power,authority, and abilities in disbelief. Through a series of thirteen scenarios,Adam describes thirteen kingdoms that falsely identify the illuminator asoriginating from sources as varied as “two illuminators,” “a great prophet,” andfrom another time, “the aeon which is below….” It is the generation in Adam'sfuture “without a king over it” that correctly identifies the origins of theilluminator as being divinely chosen from all time, past and future, and broughtinto the present: “God chose him from all the aeons. He caused knowledge of theundefiled one of great truth to come to be.…”15[index_split_086.html#filepos502692] Clearly, such texts offer new perspectivesand fresh insights into the fragmented details that commonly remain in“authorized” versions of our ancient heritage.THE THUNDER: PERFECT MINDPerhaps the most powerful among the Nag Hammadi works is a rare text written bya woman of the Gnostic traditions, titled The Thunder: Perfect Mind. In thewords of one of the text's translators, George W. MacRae, this work is“virtually unique in the Nag Hammadi Library and very unusual.”16[index_split_086.html#filepos502820] Written in the first person, the manuscriptis in the form of a dialogue in which the unnamed author proclaims herself tohave experienced many dichotomies of human experience. “For I am the first andthe last. I am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holyone. I am the wife and the virgin. I am the barren one and many are her sons.”17[index_split_086.html#filepos503014]Through collections of words that are reminiscent of the poetry found in theDead Sea Scrolls, she reminds us that within every person lives allpossibilities of all experience, from the lightest of the light to the darkestof the dark. The text continues with a final verse admonishing readers toremember that as men go to their resting place, “There they will find me, andthey will live, and they will never die again.”18[index_split_086.html#filepos503142]THE GOSPEL OF THOMASOne of the most controversial of the Nag Hammadi texts is the document known asthe Gospel of Thomas. At least a portion of this manuscript is identified asbeing translated from Greek into Coptic Egyptian, the language used in Christianmonasteries of Egypt early in the first millennium. The Gospel of Thomas is arare collection of sayings, parables, stories, and direct quotes from Jesus,believed to have been recorded by the brother of Jesus, Didymos Judas Thomas.This is the same Thomas who later founded Christian churches in the East.Portions of the gospel are very similar to the manuscript of the Gospel Q,19[index_split_086.html#filepos503264] a source manuscript, believed to date tothe first century. The “Q” texts, so called from the German word Quelle, meaning“source,” are known to have been used as a reference by New Testament authors.There are, however, many portions of the Gospel of Thomas that are not found inthe Gospel Q, suggesting that it is an independent resource that may confirm andvalidate other texts dating from the same time.The words of Thomas's gospel are some of the most mystical of the Gnostic texts.At the same time, in light of the rich context provided by the Dead Sea Scrolls,the same words take on new meaning, and offer new understandings. For example,in response to a question from his disciples regarding their eventual fate inthis world, the Gospel of Thomas records Jesus as answering with a parable: “Forthere are five trees for you in Paradise which remain undisturbed summer andwinter and whose leaves do not fall. Whosoever becomes acquainted with them willnot experience death.”20 [index_split_086.html#filepos503508] In the absence ofa frame of reference for the “five trees,” these words offer little more than amystical proverb to ponder. Within the context offered by the Essene angels oflife, however, these words become a source of confirmation for the ancientscience of eternal life: the five keys of thought, feeling, body, breath, andnutrient. Texts confirming that Jesus was a master of the Essene traditions lendadditional credibility to the interpretation of this mystical reference toeternal life."},{"pageContent":"BEYOND SCIENCE, RELIGION, AND MIRACLESThe same texts that preserved the prophecies suggest that it is possible totransmute such predictions of catastrophic change, even those that appear to beimminent. Texts such as the Essene Gospels and the Nag Hammadi Library detail awisdom that allows us to pool our individual life-affirming visions into acollective will to reshape our future. In doing so, we redefine ancient visionsof rising sea levels, devastating earthquakes, life-threatening solar flares,and the threat of global war.As different in some respects as the details of our lost heritage may appear tobe, there are common themes that bind the same texts into a meaningful source ofknowledge for today. Throughout the wisdom that predates history, we arereminded that choices affirming life in the world of our thoughts, feelings, andemotions are mirrored as times of peace and forgiveness in the larger world ofour families and communities. In the same manner, choices that deny the gift oflife in our bodies are mirrored as unrest, oppression, and warfare in ourcities, governments, and nations. Once again we are invited to remember that ourinner and outer worlds are mirrors of each other. It is the simplicity of thissingle memory that allows the miracles, such as the healing recounted at thebeginning of this chapter, to be expected rather than hoped for.Perhaps the most empowering of the elements lost in the fourthcentury edits ofthe Nicean Council are the sciences of prophecy and prayer. Regarded by many asthe most ancient of all sciences, these inner technologies represent ouropportunity to first identify the future consequences of present-day choices,then to choose our future with confidence and trust.> I read therein what had always been, what was now, and what would come to> pass.> > > > —THE ESSENE GOSPEL OF PEACE> > [images/00006.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"[images/00011.jpg]THE PROPHECIES Silent Visions of a Forgotten Future Almost universally, centuries-old traditions remind us that our lifetime is noordinary time in the history of humanity or the earth.

Written to a people that they could onlyimagine in dreams, their messages keep alive the memory of visions that in someinstances predate the earliest moments of our recorded history. Over time, thethemes of their visions have been incorporated into a variety of religioustraditions and spiritual practices. As diverse as they appear, hints ofsimilarity in such traditions offer clues to the meaning of these sacred wordstoday. Only recently, with the aid of computers and other twentieth-centuryscience, have references of ancient visions into future time been confirmed andvalidated."},{"pageContent":"KEEPERS OF TIME: THE MYSTERIOUS MAYAAs we near the dawn of the twenty-first century, among the unsolved mysteries ofour past are those of the ancient Maya. Almost as sudden as their appearance inthe remote areas of the Yucatán peninsula, nearly a millennium and a half ago,these architects of massive temples and celestial observatories suddenlyvanished around A.D. 830. In addition to their sprawling plazas and stonetowers, they left clues to their past, and perhaps our future, in theirunsurpassed calculations of time.The calendar of the Mayan people may be one of the oldest and most sophisticatedsystems of timekeeping known to mankind. Until the advent of our atomic clocks,based on the vibration of the cesium atom, the Mayan calendar rivaled theaccuracy of any records of time known before the twentieth century. To thepresent day, descendants of the ancient Maya track time and ascertain thecorrect date through a system that, according to experts, has “not slipped oneday in over twenty-five centuries.”1 [index_split_087.html#filepos503769]Recognizing nature as recurring cycles of events, the Mayan calendar mirrorsthat people's understanding of time as a system of intermeshing periods.Key to the Mayan timekeepers was a 260-day count called the tzolkin or “SacredCalendar.” Common among other Mesoamerican traditions as well, the tzolkin iscreated as the interface between twenty named days and a counter based on thenumber thirteen. The Maya, however, carried their timekeeping a step further.Intermeshed with a 365-day count called the “Vague Year,” the two cycles of timeprogressed like the cogs of two wheels until the rare moment when one day on theSacred Calendar matched the same day of the Vague Year. Marking the end of afifty-two-year cycle, this much-celebrated day defined an even longer expanse oftime. The “Great Cycle” of the previous 5,200 years was measured as one hundredof the fifty-two-year cycles. Based on these calculations and the traditions ofthe Maya calendar priests themselves, their records of our last Great Cyclebegin in the biblical time of Moses, 3114 B.C., and end in our near future, in2012.Mayan visions of our future and their system of timekeeping are closely related.These ancient prophets suggested that cycles of time have unique characteristicsbased upon a “great wave” that travels periodically through the cosmos. As thewave ripples through creation, its movement synchronizes life and the forces ofnature on a cyclic basis. The completion of our course in the present cycle isviewed as particularly significant to earth as well as humankind.Recognized as an expert in Mayan cosmology, Dr. Jose Arguelles suggests that thepresent twenty-year subcycle, which began in 1992, marks “the emergence ofnonmaterialistic, ecologically harmonic technologies…to compliment the newdecentralized mediarchy information society.…”2[index_split_087.html#filepos503973] The Mayan elders of today believe that theclose of this great millennial cycle will occur within our lifetime, in 2012,and has been anticipated for over three thousand years. They view this raremoment as both the culmination and the birth of a time of rare change. Referringto specific attributes assigned to the cycles, Dr. Arguelles echoes the Mayanbelief, suggesting that with the convergence of the Mayan cycles, our purpose to“gather whole the mind of earth… and seal it with the star-seed harmony”3[index_split_087.html#filepos504169] is fulfilled.In a similar fashion, the Aztec traditions of central Mexico track the greatexpanses of earth's history as cycles called “Suns.” Their history tells of atime of the First Sun, named Nahui Ocelotl, when our world was inhabited bygiants living within the earth. Reminiscent of biblical references to a similarworld, the pre-Nicean Book of Enoch describes the days when “the womenconceiving brought forth giants, whose stature was each three hundred cubits.*[index_split_035.html#filepos176833]These devoured all which the labor of men produced until it became impossible tofeed them.…”4 [index_split_087.html#filepos504296] This period ended when theanimal kingdom overcame the human kingdom. There are no indications of survivorsfrom this unusual time in earth's history.The Second Sun, or next great cycle, named Nahui Ehecatl, was noted as the timewhen new humans began to cultivate and crossbreed plants. The completion of thisperiod was marked by a great wind that swept across the surface of the earth,clearing everything in its path.During the Third Sun, Nahui Quiauhuitl, earth's populations constructed greattemples and cities. Tremendous openings within the earth and a “rain of fire”are said to have marked the end of this cycle. We can see in the geologicalrecord that there was, in fact, a time when portions of the earth appeared to becovered with fire. It is generally believed that the scorching was the result ofa direct hit by an object, possibly an asteroid, nearly 65 million years ago.The ending of the Fourth Sun, in ice and a great flood, is confirmedgeologically as well as in oral and written tradition common the world over. TheAztec calendar indicates that today we are living the last days of the FifthSun. The close of that fifth world is predicted to occur in our lifetime,coinciding with the last Mayan cycle and making way for the next great cycle,the birth of the Sixth Sun.With the past as a template, many ancient traditions describe the days of changeas times of tribulation and purification. During these times we are invited toconsider the rare and, in some instances, destructive displays of nature as anopportunity to strengthen and prepare us for even greater changes yet to come inour world. Themes common to the prophecies for this time in history includeunusual weather phenomena and the loss of coastlines due to sea level increases,famines, droughts, earthquakes, and the breakdown of global infrastructures.Twentieth-century prophets, such as Edgar Cayce, have foreseen massive earthchanges predicted to redefine the geography of North America throughout the late1990s and into the twenty-first century. These include visions of a great inlandsea connecting the Gulf of Mexico with the Great Lakes, for example, and thesubmerging of much of the eastern and western seaboards. Graphic descriptions ofour future, sometimes created hundreds or thousands of years in our past, haveset a new standard for the possibilities of inner technology and prophecy. Howcould our ancestors have glimpsed events still to come in our time? Perhaps moreimportant, how accurate are their visions of our future?"},{"pageContent":"REMOTE VIEWING: TWENTIETH-CENTURY PROPHETSThe word prophet conjures up images of ancient seers draped in hooded robes,embarking upon open-eyed dream quests into a time yet to come. In the traditionsof biblical prophets, this may well be the case. The science of prophecy,however, has continued into the present as a respected profession clad in themystery of a new name.Based on research conducted at the prestigious Stanford Research Institute (SRI)during the early 1970s,5 [index_split_087.html#filepos504638] the ability towitness events from a distance has been called remote viewing. Though thespecifics for remote viewing may vary from person to person, the generalprocedure is similar for each viewer. Often beginning in a mild, closed-eyestate of relaxation, the receiver works with sensory impressions regardingevents that may be occurring anywhere on the planet—in the next room or at adesert outpost halfway around the world. Trained to distinguish among the manykinds of sensations, the viewer then assigns identifiers to the experience,refining the impressions to greater levels of detail. Sounds, smells, tastes,and sensations, as well as images, may accompany such a journey. The trainingthat teaches remote viewers to accept and record such impressions without biasis the expertise that sets them apart from the casual dreamer. With obviousimplications for secrecy and intelligence, such capabilities suggest an entirenew realm of intelligence gathering with fewer risks.Remote viewing now plays a viable role in the security and defense of nations inthe free world. In 1991, for example, remote viewers working under the auspicesof Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) were asked to narrowthe search area for a particular kind of missile in western Iraq.6[index_split_087.html#filepos504886] Confining the search to specific portionsof the Iraqi desert held the potential to save time, fuel, and lives, as well asmoney. Clearly, remote viewing, the ability to project the awareness of anindividual from one location to another, had become the subject of seriousstudy. Ironically, it is only now, in the last years of the second millennium,that modern science has confirmed the principles of such inner technology,understood by prophets 2,500 years ago.For many people, their first exposure to the science of viewing real-time eventsfrom a distance has come about through guests on late-night radio talk shows.Sparked by the approaching millennium, a variety of experts in the field offuture and remote vision claim to have ventured into the world of apostmillennial earth, sometimes with disturbing, yet not surprising, results.Similar to the descriptions of other millennial prophecies, remote journeys intoour future have generally fallen into one of two categories of experience. Someviewers found that they could see no further than the year A.D. 2012, thefamiliar year of the Mayan calendar and the close of our great cycle. In 2012,the time travelers reported seeing a very different earth. From theirpresent-day vantage point, the world appeared to have experienced some form ofcataclysm. They reported no buildings, no sign of commerce or normalcy bytoday's standards. The viewers of A.D. 2012 may well have found themselves inthe presence of an outcome that has been described by seers and prophets alike,the postwar destruction of much of our world as we know it today.Other viewers peering into our future in recent times report a similar scenario,with the addition of a great wave of fire and heat. This scenario is reminiscentof theories anticipating cyclic waves of proton flux and plasma that travelthrough the cosmos over tremendous cycles of time, occasionally finding earth intheir path. With either scenario, the reports of the remote viewers describe afuture that appears to be something less than inviting. Following a common themeof many millennial prophecies, there may be an alternative to such outcomes."},{"pageContent":"NOSTRADAMUSFor over four hundred years, the word prophecy has been nearly synonymous withthe name of a great seer whose visions extended hundreds of years into thefuture. Born on December 14, 1503, Michel de Nostredame became known asNostradamus, perhaps the most illustrious prophet of recent memory. His gift ofsecond sight allowed him to peer into the future of his time, witnessing eventswith extraordinary detail and accuracy. As he studied ancient oracles, hedeveloped his own techniques for navigating the waves of time as an observer,often bringing future technologies seen in his visions back into his time.Eventually, Nostradamus became a physician, incorporating many of the ideas fromhis prophecies into his practice. His techniques, appearing as common sensetoday, were revolutionary for sixteenth-century Europe during the time of theBlack Plague, and included the use of herbs, fresh air, and clean water.Additionally, he prescribed mixtures of aloe and rose petals, rich in vitaminsunknown in his time.One of the best-known reports of Nostradamus's ability to peer into the futurebegan unexpectedly as he met a group of friars walking along a road. Immediatelykneeling at the feet of one man, Nostradamus kissed the robe of the friar. Whenasked why, he simply replied, “I must bend a knee before His Holiness.” It wasnot until forty years later, nineteen years after the death of Nostradamus, thatthe mysterious event on the lonely road made sense. In 1585, the friar whoserobes the prophet had kissed became Pope Sixtus V.In what is perhaps his best-known work, The Centuries, Nostradamus recorded hisvisions of our future. By the time of his death he had recorded visions for tencenturies, each with one hundred verses of four lines each, called quatrains.Remaining in print consistently since the time of his death, the prophecies ofNostradamus extend into the year 3797 and, depending upon interpretation,perhaps beyond.Foreseeing social, political, and scientific events of global magnitude, many ofhis visions appear to be exceedingly accurate. Without specific dates, othersare nebulous at best and subject to interpretation. Nostradamus noted two worldwars, complete with the name of Hitler and a description of the swastika symbol,the discoveries of penicillin and nuclear energy, the assassination of John F.Kennedy, the AIDS virus, and the failure of Communism. Though dates and eventsmay be subject to interpretation, there is a thread of agreement among scholarsof Nostradamus that the prophet foresaw cataclysmic change, on a global scale,for the close of our millennium.Although the precise timing of an event could certainly be calculated by hisreaders from key phrases, it was only when he felt that a particular event wascritical that Nostradamus offered the actual date. It is of particular interest,then, that one of these dates occurs within our lifetime. Centuries X, quatrain72, reads, “In the year 1999, and seven months from the sky will come the greatKing of Terror. He will bring to life the great King of the Mongols. Before andafter, war reigns happily.”7 [index_split_087.html#filepos505013] Additionalinsight into this ominous quatrain may be found in The Epistle to Henry II,verse 87, where Nostradamus writes that, “This will be preceded by an eclipse ofthe sun, more obscure and tenebrous than has ever been since the creation of theworld, except that after the death and passion of Jesus Christ.” A solareclipse, visible from much of the European continent, did occur on August 11,1999.Nostradamus's visions also foresaw cataclysmic earth changes reminiscent ofthose found in Native American and biblical traditions. Continuing in verse 88of the epistle to Henry II, specifics are offered down to the actual month.“There will be omens in the spring, and extraordinary changes thereafter,reversals of nations and mighty earthquakes.… And there shall be in the month ofOctober a great movement of the globe, and it will be such that one will thinkthe earth has lost its natural gravitational movement and that it will beplunged into the abyss of perpetual darkness.”Looking farther into our future, Nostradamus saw a much happier time followingthe days of earth's darkness. In a passage from Centuries II, quatrain 12,scholars interpret Nostradamus's vision as depicting a time of spiritualrenewal: “The body without a soul is no longer at the sacrifice. At the day ofdeath it comes to rebirth.” Centuries III further describes this time in ourfuture in quatrain 2: “The divine word will give the sustance containing heavenand earth…. Body, soul, and spirit are all powerful. Everything is beneath hisfeet, as at the seat of heaven.” Certainly less than scientific and open to muchinterpretation, nevertheless these sixteenthcentury visions of our future sharecommon threads with those of other prophets, both older and more recent."},{"pageContent":"EDGAR CAYCEEdgar Cayce is the man who came to be known as the “sleeping prophet” of thetwentieth century. Born in March 1877, Cayce's formal education ended when hecompleted the ninth grade. Though he reported paranormal experiences as a child,he did not develop his gifts of clairvoyance and healing on a large scale untiladulthood.Limiting his healing sessions to two per day, Cayce often journeyed into thepast experiences of his clients in an effort to understand their presentconditions. Though he did not remember the contents of his readings when heawakened from the trancelike state in which he conducted them, Cayce'ssecretary, Gladys Davis, was always present to record the sessions. Throughhundreds of such records, systematically catalogued for study at the Associationfor Research and Enlightenment (ARE), Cayce offered brief glimpses into therecesses of our forgotten past, as well as our millennial future.Edgar Cayce's first healing, reported to have occurred at the age oftwenty-four, was one that he performed upon himself. With the aid of ahypnotist, Cayce was asked to address a persistent throat condition while in arelaxed state of altered consciousness. To the surprise of others in the room,in his “sleeping state” Cayce began to speak, directing the hypnotist to offersuggestions to his unconscious body. Responding almost immediately toinstructions redirecting the flow of blood in his upper body, the throatcondition disappeared and Edgar Cayce began what would become a lifelong serviceof performing similar readings for others.The accuracy of Cayce's readings is well documented. He foresaw the crash of thestock market in October of 1929 through reading #137-117: “There must surelycome a break where it would be panic in the money centers—not only of WallStreet's activity but a closing of the boards in many centers.…”8[index_split_087.html#filepos505222] Cayce witnessed what would later be calledthe Second World War, years before it occurred. In his future vision of theconflict (reading #416-7), he stated that countries would begin to take sides as“indicated by the Austrians, Germans and later the Japanese joining in theirinfluence.…”9 [index_split_087.html#filepos505482] His description continues,stating that unless there was intervention by a force that he described assupernatural, “the affairs of nations and peoples, the whole world, as it were,will be set on fire by the militaristic groups and those that are for power andexpansion.…”10 [index_split_087.html#filepos505607]In what were to become some of his best-known yet confusing prophecies, Caycesuggested that the final years of the twentieth century and the early years ofthe twenty-first would be a time of unprecedented earth changes. As with pastseers, he envisioned global changes falling into two broad categories: a futurebrought about by gradual change, and a time of tumultuous shifts that may bedescribed as nothing short of catastrophic. Interestingly, both kinds ofprophecy occur for the same period in time.In reading #826-8, dated August 1936, Cayce is asked specifically about changesthat he sees for the actual years of the millennium, 2000 to 2001. Far from thevagueness of many such prophecies, his response is a direct statement regardinga tangible shift of measurable change on the earth. “There is the shifting ofthe pole. Or a new cycle begins.…”11 [index_split_087.html#filepos505729]Fluctuations of the earth's magnetic poles of over five degrees in the lastforty years, considered with the rapid decrease of magnetic intensity precedingsuch polar reversals in earth's history, have brought a renewed respect to suchvisions.In a series of readings that culminated in January of 1934, Cayce describedgeographic and geophysical changes that he saw beginning within a forty-yearperiod between 1958 and 1998.12 [index_split_087.html#filepos505856] One key tointerpreting these indicators is that they were prophesied to begin, rather thanhappen, by 1998. Such changes could conceivably extend well into the nextcentury. Mark Thurston, a leading expert in the teachings and philosophies ofEdgar Cayce, summarizes Cayce's descriptions as follows: 1. There will be a breaking up of the landmass of the western portion of America. 2. The larger part of Japan will go into the sea. 3. 3. There will be certain changes to the northern parts of Europe that will happen so quickly that it might be called “in the twinkling of an eye.” 4. Lands will rise up out of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of America. 5. Major upheavals will hit the Arctic and Antarctic. 6. Volcanoes will erupt, especially in the tropics. 7. A shifting of the poles will alter climatic conditions. For example, certain frigid and semitropical areas will become tropical.As Thurston points out, several of these changes appear to be connected directlyto a magnetic pole shift. Although a complete shift has yet to occur, a growingbody of scientists and researchers believe that recent shifts of earth'smagnetic fields are the precursors to precisely such an event.13[index_split_087.html#filepos505983]Although a number of Cayce's earlier predictions regarding millennial propheciesappear to be catastrophic in nature, later readings note an interesting thoughsubtle change. In a reading dated 1939, Cayce's view into the close of thecentury describes gradual changes rather than the sudden shifts describedearlier. Cayce states that “in 1998 we will find a great deal of activity thathas been created by the gradual changes that are coming about.”14[index_split_087.html#filepos506343] He continues speaking about the millennialshift by stating that “as to the changes, the change between the Piscean and theAquarian Age is gradual, not a cataclysmic one.”15[index_split_087.html#filepos506512]In offering two different views of the change of centuries, Cayce mayadditionally have offered a new insight into the value of prophecy in our livestoday. Recognizing that his readings of catastrophic as well as gradual changeswere made within a matter of years from one another rather than centuries, whatchange in our future could the difference in his readings suggest?Regardless of whose visions into our future we consider, for the most part eachappears to escape exact measurements of time. They appear to represent momentsof possibility, rather than a concrete appointment with a precise outcome. Inhis own words, the “sleeping prophet” offers a key to the science of prophecy,reminding us that we influence the outcome of history through the course of ourlives in the present. In reading #311-10,16 [index_split_087.html#filepos506639]Cayce suggests that our response to the challenges of our lives may determine,at least in part, the degree to which we experience the changes he foresaw.“[It] may depend upon much that deals with the metaphysical…. There are thoseconditions that in the activity of individuals, in line of thought and endeavor,keep oft many a city and many a land intact through their application ofspiritual laws.”"},{"pageContent":"NATIVE AMERICAN PROPHECIESNative North and South American peoples believe firmly that present-day eventsecho details of their ancestors' prophecy. For many, visions of a world to comehave been held secretly in tribal traditions to preserve the integrity of theirancestors' insight. Sensing that the shift of the millennium represents the dayof tribal prophecies, their guidelines for this time in history are now sharedopenly. The belief is that people of all walks of life, in all nations, maybenefit from the insights left long ago. Allowing for specific differences infamily and tribal traditions, there are common threads that link many of thetribal prophecies of the Americas in a unified vision of our future.The Hopi of the American Southwest offer some of the most concise visions of ourfuture in their prophecies of the birth of a new sun. Similar to the traditionsof the Maya, the Aztecs, and earlier indigenous traditions found throughout theAmericas, the Hopi believe that there have been great cycles of human experiencebefore our time. Each ended in a period of destruction, the most recent of whichwas the Great Flood. We are living near the close of one such cycle, they say,preparing to move into the days of the Fifth Sun. Prior to the close of ourcycle, Hopi prophecies describe a period of decline followed by a transitionperiod into the next cycle. From their perspective, the time of decline is atime of great challenge, often called the “time of purification.” Understandingthat the earth and our bodies are one, the Hopi view the conditions of the earthas a “feedback mechanism,” a barometer of sorts, reminding us of when we havemade choices that affirm or deny life in our world.One of the first Hopi visions to be disclosed were three signs denoting atimetable for the Great Shift. The first sign was the appearance of the moon “onthe earth as well as in the heavens.” The fulfillment of this portion of theprophecy remained a mystery until 1993, when lunar images began to appear ascrop circles in the grain fields of the English countryside. The unmistakableimages of the crescent moon were interpreted by Hopi elders as the fulfillmentof the first portion of their prophecy.The second sign was the appearance of the “blue star,” a symbol that is commonin the folklore and myths of many Hopi traditions. Some Hopi elders saw the 1994impact of the Comet ShoemakerLevy into Jupiter as the fulfillment of thisprophecy. Researchers were mystified as to how the impact of a broken cometcould be seen as the fulfillment of the prophecy. Their answer was revealed whenspectrographic images of the giant planet were viewed following the collisions;Jupiter was glowing with a curious blue hue that could be seen only withsophisticated imaging devices!Perhaps the most mystical sign of the Hopi prophecies is the third and last.Prominent in the dance, weavings, and sand paintings of the Hopi are curious,humanoid images that often adorn their homes and ceremonial sites. With strangecostumes and very otherworldly faces, these representations of Hopi ancestry,the sky people, are called kachinas. The third portion of the Hopi prophecystates that the time of the great change has occurred when the kachinas returnfrom the stars and dance once again in the plazas of their villages on themesas. To the best of my knowledge at the time of this writing, this third signhas yet to happen."},{"pageContent":"BIBLICAL PROPHECIESAs documented in chapter 2 of this book, a number of books related to the modernBible were deemed inappropriate for official acceptance by the Catholic Churchin the fourth century. Relegated to the obscurity of Church vaults and privatelibraries, one of the most fascinating, and perhaps most mystical, is theancient book of the prophet Enoch. Containing eloquent descriptions of theCreation, human lineage, and astronomical information so detailed that it couldonly be verified with twentieth-century technology, this ancient text came to beknown as the Book of the Secrets of Enoch. We find direct references to thisnow-rare text in the work of the second-century theologian Tertullian. Inrecently recovered letters he explains that the “Scripture of Enoch” is nottreated in the same way as other scriptures because it is not included in theHebrew Canon.17 [index_split_087.html#filepos506767] Such references confirmthat the Book of Enoch was regarded as a viable work by scholars before thefourth-century edits of the Nicean Council.The prophecies of Enoch bear a remarkable resemblance to those of subsequentbiblical prophets such as Isaiah and, later, John in the Book of Revelation. Intremendous detail, Enoch describes his journey of prophecy into our future tohis son, Methuselah, who records his father's experience for the generationsthat will follow. From an Ethiopian manuscript discovered in the BodleianLibrary in 1773, Enoch shares his vision of weather and celestial changes thathe foresaw during the close of our century. Identified as the “seventh son afterAdam,” Methuselah characterizes his father's prophetic experiences verydifferently from those of the sleeping Cayce, for example, when he says thatEnoch “spoke while his eyes were open, and while he saw a holy vision in theheavens.”18 [index_split_087.html#filepos506936]Following his great visions of our future, Enoch stated that he had “heard allthings, and understood what he saw; that which will not take place in hisgeneration, but in a generation which is to succeed at a distant period, onaccount of the elect…. In those days… the rain shall be restrained… the fruitsof the earth shall be late, and not flourish in their season; and in theirseason the fruits of the trees shall be withholden… heaven shall stand still.The moon shall change its laws, and not be seen at its proper period.…”19[index_split_087.html#filepos507062]Immediately following the tribulation that he describes for the earth, Enochdescribes an additional sequence of events embodying a time of beauty, hope, andpossibility. In this sequence, appearing as if it originates from a differentvision describing a different time, Enoch sees the former heaven “depart andpass away,” and declares that “a new heaven shall appear.” This odd pattern oftribulation, appearing to be followed by redemption, is common throughout thevisions of Enoch, as well as other prophecies that we will examine.Perhaps the most emotionally charged insights into future times may be found asa collection of prophetic visions in the modern biblical texts. Ranging from thefate of specific leaders and heads of state to global visions of the end oftime, prophecies of the Bible continue to elicit powerful responses from thosewho read them, thousands of years after the visions themselves occurred. Rangingfrom ceaseless curiosity to adamant fervor, clues into the power, as well asconfusion surrounding such visions may be found in tracing their moderninterpretations to the roots of the original visions themselves.It is not uncommon to discover, for example, that many of the propheciesreferenced today were not even recorded until years, sometimes hundreds ofyears, after an original prophecy was received. Because they were handed frommouth to mouth, from generation to generation, it is uncertain whether someprophetic books were written by the prophets themselves or by others using thename of a prophet as a metaphor in the stories.The Book of Daniel offers such an example. In the Saint Joseph Edition of theNew American Bible, the preface to the Book of Daniel states that “this booktakes its name, not from the author, who is actually unknown, but from its hero,a young Jew taken early to Babylon, where he lived at least until 538 B.C.”20[index_split_087.html#filepos507189] The introduction goes on to say, “The Bookcontains stories originating in and transmitted by popular traditions which tellof the trials and triumphs of the wise Daniel and his three companions.”This interpretation directly contradicts that of other biblical scholars, suchas John Walvoord, who states that “it is clear that the book itself claims to bea product of Daniel as he is referred to in the first person in numerouspassages in the second half of the book…. Daniel is also mentioned in Ezekiel,which would be quite natural as Ezekiel was a contemporary of Daniel.…21[index_split_087.html#filepos507444] Even today, nearly two millennia after thetexts were compiled, experts have yet to reach a consensus regarding even thebasics of some of our most sacred texts. Adding to the confusion of decipheringbiblical prophecies is the question of the precision with which the wording has,or has not, been translated through the centuries. Unlike portions of the HebrewBible, known to be translated letter for letter with exacting precision for atleast the last thousand years,* [index_split_035.html#filepos177204]the WesternBible has undergone many changes. Even since the time of our country's founding,less than three hundred years ago, adaptations, translations from one languageto another, and various interpretations of the Bible have introduced a certainmargin of error. As accurate as our biblical collection of history, genealogy,and wisdom may be in some respects, it cannot be taken word for word; the textchanges with each translation. Often there are simply no words in one languagethat represent exactly the same concept, in the same way, as it is expressed inanother language. In these instances, the translators must do the best that theycan. This is where an approximation of themes and concepts may be introducedinto such translations.The Western Bible, as we know it today, has undergone many such processes,including a translation from the highly symbolic language of Egyptian, followingits origins in the Aramaic and Hebrew languages. An example of how approximationmay subtly alter a well-intended translation is illustrated in the Aramaic wordsfor the first line of the Lord's Prayer. In English, this phrase reads as thefamiliar “Our Father which art in heaven.” In the original Aramaic, however, thesame phrase reads simply as two words: Abwoon d'bwashmaya. There are no exactwords in English for these two Aramaic words. Translators are left to skillfullycreate collections of English words that approximate the original meaning. Asampling of such approximations is illustrated by the following possibletranslations of this example from the Lord's Prayer: “O Birther! Father-Motherof the Cosmos,” “O Thou! The Breathing Life of all,” “Name of names, our smallidentity unravels within you,” and “Radiant One: You shine within us.”22[index_split_087.html#filepos507679] Each of these is a valid translation of theoriginal words, and each expresses a very different feeling for the intent ofthe original text.From this example alone, we may see that the theme remains constant, althoughthe specifics of language may vary. As in photocopying the original of a texttoday, many copies down the line the final outcome may bear a resemblance to theoriginal, though it has lost clarity. In the last century of biblical history,there have been many such opportunities to introduce error into the originalintent of the ancient prophets. Today we may choose from a variety ofinterpretations and translations, each meeting a special need and serving aparticular application for its reader. A student of biblical studies may choosefrom the King James Version of the biblical texts or a host of others, such asthe New International Standard Version, The New Living Bible, and the SaintJoseph Edition. Each version originates from the same collection of scrolls,books, documents, and manuscripts accepted by the Church in the fourth centuryA.D."},{"pageContent":"THE LOST PROPHECYIn modern renditions of biblical prophecies, we find a particular class ofvisionary texts identified by such names as “the End of Time,” “the End Days,”or “in those days.” Collectively these works are known as the apocalypticprophecies. Often believed to identify a frightening time of darkness andcataclysm in earth's future, these works may, in fact, have been showing futuregenerations something of a vastly different nature.In modern times the word apocalypse conjures up deep feelings of gloom,hopelessness, and judgment in our collective psyche. Taken from the Greek wordapokalypsis, the word has a brief and seemingly innocent definition. It simplymeans to disclose or reveal. This is precisely what the ancient prophets offeredthrough their masterful insights into our future. They revealed possibleoutcomes based on the conditions of their time, and disclosed their discoveriesto future generations.The Essene Book of Revelation is an example of one such book. Recovered andtranslated from the native Aramaic language that it was written in, this versionof Revelation is so similar to later canonized versions known as the Revelationto John that researchers and scholars suspect the Dead Sea manuscript may be theoriginal rendition of this ancient view into our future.Regarded by many as the most mystical of the biblical prophecies, the visions ofJohn the Apostle also portray some of the most graphic descriptions oftribulation in any prophecy, ancient or modern. Contributing to what is alreadya deeply symbolic and esoteric text is the fragmented nature of John's vision.During the canonization of the Bible in 325, it appears almost as if acompromise were reached regarding some of the key texts. Rather than discardingthe manuscripts completely, they were retained as edited versions, thuscondensing them into a format that was believed to be more accessible to thereaders of the time.The journey that becomes John's revelation to future generations begins as heasks to be taken from his time, ahead of our time, and allowed to see ourprobable future and one possible end to the close of our millennium. Throughgraphic detail, John describes his vision of chaos, death, terror, anddestruction, the magnitude of which had never been seen before. He asks hisangelic guide why these things are happening, and the angel replies, “Man hascreated these powers of destruction. He has wrought them from his own mind. Hehas turned his face away from the Angels [forces] of the Heavenly Father and theEarthly Mother, and he has fashioned his own destruction.”23[index_split_087.html#filepos507933]Upon witnessing this outcome, John's heart is “heavy with compassion.” He asks,“Is there no hope?” The voice replies to John, echoing a memory of the greatestpossibilities for today and future generations: “There is always hope, O thoufor whom heaven and earth were created.…”24 [index_split_087.html#filepos508178]Suddenly the vision of death and destruction fades from view and he is shownanother scenario, a second possibility. Rather than the end of all that humanityhas grown to know and love, this new possibility illustrates an outcome of avery different nature. “But I saw not what befell them, my vision changed, and Isaw a new heaven and a new Earth: for the first heaven and the first earth werepassed away.… And I heard a great voice… saying, there shall be no more death,neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.”25[index_split_087.html#filepos508300]As John's vision continues, he sees a time when peace and cooperation envelopthe nations of the world. During this time there is no longer a need for war. Hehears his guide describe the end of warfare: “Nation shall not lift up swordagainst nation, neither shall they learn war anymore, for the former things arepassed away.”26 [index_split_087.html#filepos508428] Through these and similarpassages, we are offered a message of hope.Following a theme now familiar from other prophecies, John was shown twopossibilities for the future of humankind. Both outcomes were real, and eithercould be chosen by the peoples of the earth. The key, reminiscent of our massprayer of peace, was that the collective outcome would be determined throughindividual choices. The ability of the people in John's time to honor the lawsof life were the experiences that would bring about new outcomes, diverting thepossibility of destruction.With each vision, John is reminded that people living “in those days” willdetermine how they experience the great change of humankind's future. He askswhat must occur so that the second outcome of peace may come to pass? Again, thevoice guiding his vision replies, “Behold, I make all things new.… I am thebeginning and the end.… I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain ofthe water of life freely. He that [remembers] shall inherit all things.…”27[index_split_087.html#filepos508561]The final passages record John acknowledging his understanding of what he hasseen, and the effect that his vision has had upon him: “I have reached the innervision.… I have heard thy wondrous secret…. Through thy mystic insight thou hastcaused a spring of knowledge to well up within me, a fountain of power, pouringforth living waters; a flood of all-embracing wisdom.”28[index_split_087.html#filepos508683]Additional passages from the Essene scrolls continue to detail the possibilityof a time in our future when we have outgrown the need for catastrophic shiftsto bring about change. During this time, the conditions that have taken lifefrom the inhabitants of the earth are no longer present: “In the reign of peace,there is neither hunger nor thirst, neither cold wind nor hot wind, neither oldage nor death. In the reign of peace, both animals and men shall be undying.”29[index_split_087.html#filepos508811]Clearly the biblical prophets often found themselves describing verydifferent—at times conflicting—outcomes for our future. The question is why? Whyare there different visions of prophecy for the same time in our future? How cana prophet see two very different possibilities for the same period of time?In the mid-1990s a new tool of prophecy was discovered in a very ancient format.It may be that the time lock of technology has allowed us to peer through theeyes of this prophetic instrument only as we have matured to recognize itspossibilities."},{"pageContent":"THE 3,000-YEAR-OLD TIME MAPIn 1995, an ancient instrument of prophecy was abruptly thrust into public viewin a graphic and dramatic fashion. On November 4 of that year, an event occurredthat the instrument had predicted with a precision far exceeding the possibilityof chance or coincidence. The event was the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, theprime minister of Israel, in the city of Tel Aviv. The assassination had beenprophesied with such accuracy that the prime minister's name, the date of theassassination, the name of the city, and even the assassin's name, Amir, were nosecret; each had been encoded into a document over three thousand years ago!The irony was that the document was not a rare manuscript held by a secretorganization or privileged individual. The coded map of our future was the samemap that has provided comfort and guidance for at least seventy-five generationsand is held sacred today by several hundred million people worldwide. The map oftime was discovered as a hidden code encrypted into the Bible at the time of itsorigin! Specifically, the code was found in the first five books of the HebrewBible, known as the Torah, the one version that is said to have been unalteredsince it was given to man over three thousand years ago.Discovered by an Israeli mathematician, Dr. Eliyahu Rips, the key, known as theBible Code, has been reviewed and validated by mathematicians in leadinguniversities worldwide, as well as agencies specializing in encryption, such asthe U.S. Department of Defense. For over two hundred years, scholars havesuspected that biblical texts were more than an assemblage of words to be readin a strictly linear fashion. An eighteenth-century scholar, known as the Geniusof Vilna, stated that “the rule is that all that was, is, and will be unto theend of time is included in the Torah, from the first word to the last word. Andnot merely in a general sense, but as to the details of everything that happenedto him from the day of his birth until his end.”30[index_split_087.html#filepos508938]The encrypted messages of our past and future may be studied by creating amatrix from the letters of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Beginningwith the first letter of the first word, all spaces and punctuation are removeduntil the last letter of the last word is reached, leaving a single sentencehundreds of characters in length. Using sophisticated search programs, theremaining matrix is examined for patterns and intersections of words. Forexample, in the book of Genesis, the word Torah is spelled out with sequences offifty Hebrew characters between each of the letters of the word. The samesequence is found in the books that follow: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, andDeuteronomy. The observation of this sequence by Rabbi H. M. D. Weissmandel inthe 1940s became the key to unraveling the patterns of words encoded in thetext.In his book of the same name, Michael Drosnin describes the precision andaccuracy of the Bible Code in predicting past events. Circumstances as varied asthe Kennedy assassinations, the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy into Jupiter, theelection of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, even the dates and location of theSCUD missile attack that the Iraqis launched against Israel during the 1990 GulfWar, are described with a level of detail that defies mathematical andstatistical odds. The Bible Code offers specifics rather than broad generalitiesthat may be open to interpretation. Drosnin details many such references. In theprediction of World War II, for example, the code spells out words such as“world war” and “final solution,” accompanied by the names of leaders during thetime: “Roosevelt,” “Churchill,” “Stalin,” and “Hitler.” Clearly stated are thecountries involved in the conflict: “Germany,” “England,” “France,” “Russia,”“Japan,” and “United States.” Even the words “atomic holocaust” and “1945,” theyear that the nuclear device was detonated over Hiroshima are disclosed, theonly time those words appear in the Bible.It was with the development of high-speed computers that the code embeddedwithin the Hebrew Bible was finally decrypted. The new computers replacedtedious manual decoding with sophisticated search programs. Running againstcontrol groups of other texts and ten million test cases created by thecomputer, only the Bible was found to have the puzzlelike encryptions.Vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, names of countries, events, dates,times, and persons intersect with one another, providing a snapshot into theevents of our past and the possibilities of our future. While the actualmechanism of such an extraordinary predictor is discussed in chapter seven,perhaps more relevant to the question of prophecy is how this seeminglymiraculous book of time relates to our future.In light of the Bible Code's accuracy for detailing our past, how accurate couldthe same matrix be in peering into a time yet to come? In his discussions withDrosnin, Dr. Rips suggests that the entire Bible Code had to be written all atonce as a single act, rather than in a series of writings that took place overtime. Such a statement infers that all possibilities of all futures are alreadyin place. “We experience it like we experience a hologram—it looks differentwhen we look at it from a new angle—but the image, of course, is prerecorded.”31[index_split_087.html#filepos509135] The key to applying this ancient time codeto the events of our future may be in viewing it through the eyes of a quantumphysicist.In modern physics there is a tenet stating that it is impossible to know the“when” of something and the “where” of the same thing, at the same time. If youmeasure where something is, you lose information about how fast it is moving. Ifyou measure how fast it is moving, then you cannot know with certainty where thesomething is. This key to the quantum world was developed by the physicistWerner Heisenburg, and is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.32[index_split_087.html#filepos509263]Demonstrating the unpredictable behavior of nature in the quantum world, it maybe that our sense of time follows precisely this kind of behavior. If so, thepossibilities portrayed in the Bible Code may exist as just that, possibilities.The events stated, both past and future, are the end result of a sequence ofconditions that may have begun days, or even hundreds of years, before theactual event plays out. Stated as we would a modern equation, if we choose aparticular course of events, then we may expect to see such-and-such an outcome.Viewing any prediction tool as a lens into possibilities sheds new light on therole of prophecy in our lives. Coinciding with many biblical, Native American,and other prophecies for our future, the Bible Code alerts us to a series ofapocalyptic scenarios. Beginning in our near future, such occurrences as a thirdworld war originating in the Middle East, catastrophic earthquakes, and thedevastation of major population centers all appear as possibilities. The threatof a direct collision with a comet at the end of the twentieth century or earlyin the twenty-first appears to be one of the most immediate concerns.In 1992, astronomer Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center forAstrophysics announced the return of the Swift-Tuttle comet, originallydiscovered in 1858. The precise day of the comet's rediscovery was encrypted inthe Bible Code, along with its predicted return 134 years later. The actualwords “comet,” “Swift-Tuttle,” and the year of the comet's return, 2126, areclearly encoded in the text. Initially thought to be on a collision course withthe earth at the time of its return, revised calculations now suggest that thecomet will pass a safe distance away. Astronomers do, however, warn of a seriesof “near misses” leading up to the time of Swift-Tuttle in 2126, the firstoccurring in 2006. Intersecting the 2006 dateline in the Hebrew text are thewords, “Its path struck their dwelling,” accompanied with the phrase in anassociated line, “Year predicted for the world.”Following this warning are similar words leading up to the year 2010. The words“days of horror” cross this date with additional descriptions of “darkness,”“gloom,” and “comet.” Perhaps the most unsettling sequence of words regardingour future is found above the year 2012. It is here, coincidentally in the sameyear that the Mayan calendar ends, that we see the words “Earth annihilated.”This glimpse into an ancient possibility for our future provides an intriguingexample of an element found throughout the Bible Code. Drosnin states that inthe location where the date is encoded, a second passage, describing a verydifferent outcome, is described. The words simply say, “It will be crumbled,driven out, I will tear it to pieces, 5772” (the Hebrew year for 2012).33[index_split_087.html#filepos509478]Similar to the theme of other prophecies, on one hand the Code appears to besaying to us that the year 2012 brings an end to life as we know it, while atthe same time, in another location, the threat to the earth is destroyed. Howcan both outcomes be possible at the same time? Similar paradoxes show up fromtime to time throughout the Bible Code, particularly regarding outcomes ofelections, political events, and warfare. In addition to the opportunity tomodel specific outcomes for our future based on choices of the present, perhapsthe Bible Code is reminding us of something even more significant.In close proximity to specific outcomes, such as assassinations and the seeds ofglobal warfare, four words appear again and again. Accompanying many of thegravest outcomes, the words pose a simple question: “Will you change it?”Reminiscent of the beliefs preserved for us by the ancient Essenes, the BibleCode also appears to suggest that we play a significant role in the outcome ofevents, even those already set into motion as possibilities. Apparently our roleis so important that we may actually change the course of events! “Will youchange it?” appears to be a direct question asked of those who would be certainto read the codemaker's message three thousand years after it was written. It isas if the writers knew that it would take a technology with a high degree ofsophistication to understand their code; as if we are being reminded that now,as we unravel the message of the codemakers, we are ready to participate in theunfolding of time and change the darkest possibilities of our future. How couldthe appearance of these and other specifics appear today, in a manuscript thatwas encoded over three millennia ago? The Bible Code brings us back to the samequestions that the prophecies of others have led us to."},{"pageContent":"A NEW PROPHECYOf the many calculations and indigenous prophecies regarding our current time inhistory, 1998 appeared to mark the beginning of a window in time where we mayexpect to witness some of the greatest changes upon the earth. Precisely wherewithin that window our lifetime places us is questionable, even to the prophetsthemselves. Edgar Cayce, for example, viewed 1998 as the last year of a cyclefour decades long, in which we may expect “extraordinary planetarytransformation” to begin. Nostradamus, on the other hand, placed 1998 at thebeginning of a cycle of cataclysmic changes that he foresaw from that point toover three hundred years into our future. Beyond the discrepancies of exactdates, prophecies for our time almost universally reveal a common theme; theypoint to the birth of the new millennium as a time when we may expect to seegreat change upon the earth and within our bodies.Along with insights into our possible future, ancient seers reminded us of agreat mystery. This mystery is particularly fascinating in light of thesophistication of calendars and the precision of systems tracking time. Asaccurate as the oral, written, and prophetic traditions appear to be, each stopsshort of detailing precisely how this great cycle of time will end and the nextgreat cycle will begin. In addition to outlining possibilities for our future,those who have come before us acknowledged a potent force with the power tochoose which possibility we experience. Largely overlooked in recent times, thatforce is the power of mass choice expressed as the science of mass prayer.In the language of their time, ancient prophets suggested that we have theability to avert their visions of destruction in our future by consciouslyshifting the course of time in the present. It would appear as though many ofthe traditions of those before us had insight into a relationship between theactions of the people in this world and the outcome of the prophecies that theyforesaw. That connection between our day-to-day routines and the outcome ofprophecy has remained a mystery until the twentieth century. It is during thistime, with the formulation of a new physics, that the possibilities of time,prophecy, miracles, and our role in the future of humankind have became clearer.We now know that predictions offer isolated possibilities only.

There are those whobelieve we are in danger, living in a dangerous time of perilous uncertainty.They have become preoccupied with preparations for physical survival in the daysthat they believe begin the “end times.” Referencing ancient prophecies, theills of society, and the looming potential of world disasters to support theirbeliefs, for them each news item of global conflict, new diseases, or thepending collapse of the world economy becomes further evidence to support theirbeliefs. At the same time others, citing identical evidence, see change of avery different kind unfolding.Witnessing the same diseases, military conflicts, and extremes of nature, andreferencing the same prophecies, those who subscribe to this second viewpointsense that a rare birth is occurring, an integral element of which is an equallyrare shift within humankind. Ultimately, this view suggests that we are enteringa time of joy, peace, and unprecedented cooperation among the peoples andnations of the world. How can interpretations of the same evidence produce suchvaried and diverse viewpoints? Perhaps of more significance, is our futurealready sealed as the product of an ancient plan, or is there a science thatallows us to choose which future we experience?"},{"pageContent":"TIME AND GROUP WILLQuickly I reached under the seat for my belt pack and personal belongings. Icould smell the unmistakable odor of hot brake pads as the driver brought ourGerman-built touring coach to a stop. For the last two hours or so, we hadnegotiated a winding mountain road that became little more than a jeep trail inplaces. Because of rockslides, blowing sand, and infrequent maintenance, severaltimes the road had narrowed to just a fraction of a single lane. Each time ourdriver had masterfully eased us through the tight spots, sometimes choosingcircuitous detours that always brought us back to the safety of the mainroadway. Descending from the village of St. Catherine, 4,300 feet above theEgyptian desert, I knew that the checkpoint on the road ahead was near sealevel.The engine, a rest room, and bulging luggage compartments replaced the windowsnormally located in the rear of a touring bus. Moving to a side window, Iglanced to the large mirrors on one side of the bus to see behind us. Themilitary truck that had escorted us through the mountains was still there,perhaps two car lengths back. Looking over the head of our driver, I could seethat an escort vehicle similar to the one behind us had pulled off the road,near a concrete guardhouse. The camouflaged truck was a troop carrier, its backcovered by dull, sand-colored fabric, stretched over a series of wire hoops andfastened to the bed of the vehicle. I remember thinking of the similaritiesbetween the military trucks in the deserts of Egypt and the covered wagons ofthe American West that I had seen in museums as a child.The morning light peeking from behind the mountains suddenly brought the realityof these trucks to life. In the first rays of the desert sun, I could see thefaces of soldiers, young Egyptian men peering back at us from their benchesbeneath the tarp. With perhaps five men seated on either side of the truck bed,their job was to escort us safely across the Sinai Desert, into the massive cityof Cairo. Nearly as fast as the local weather changes, the political situationhad unexpectedly shifted during our time in the mountains. Now, for our overlandroute back to the hotel, a checkpoint system had been set up for our safety andto establish our whereabouts at all times. I knew that it would only be a matterof moments before a guard stepped onto our bus and approved our travel papers,and we would be on our way.Clearing the first of a series of checkpoints, we soon found ourselves windingour way along the brilliant white beaches of the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal.I closed my eyes and imagined the same scene over three thousand years ago, asthe people of Egypt traveled a similar route to the mountain from which we werenow returning. Except for the transportation and roads, how much had reallychanged? In the warmth of the late-morning sun, I soon found myself inconversation with members of our group, anticipating our entrance into theancient chambers of the Great Pyramid that evening.Suddenly I looked up as our bus came to a halt along a busy boulevard. From myseat near the front, I glanced through the windows at landmarks to orientmyself. To our left was a familiar sight, one that I had seen many times inmagazines, as well as in person. To confirm our location, I looked to our right.We were stopped in front of a monument that is one of the most powerful symbolsto all Egyptians, perhaps of even greater significance than the pyramidsthemselves: the tomb of former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.As I moved toward the front of the bus, I could see the escorts in front of us.The soldiers had jumped out from under the canopies and were milling around infront of our bus with our driver. Hopping from the last step of our bus onto thestreet, I noticed something very unusual. The escorts, our driver, and ourEgyptian guide, Mohammed, all had puzzled expressions on their faces. Some weretapping their wristwatches. Others were anxiously speaking to one another inshort bursts of Egyptian.“What's happening?” I asked our guide. “Why have we stopped here rather than atour hotel, still an hour or so away?”Mohammed looked at me in awe. “Something is not right,” he said, with a rareintensity to his normally playful voice. “We should not be here yet!”“What are you saying?” I asked. “This is precisely where we should be, on theway to our hotel in Giza.”“No,” he said. “You do not understand. We cannot be here yet. It has not beenlong enough since our departure from St. Catherine's for us to be in Cairo! Ittakes at least seven hours for us to make the drive under the Suez Canal, acrossthe desert, and into the mountains. At least seven hours. With the checkpointstops, we should be even later. Look at the guards. They do not believe theireyes! It has been only four hours. Our being here is a miracle.”Watching the men in front of me, an odd feeling swept over my body. Though I hadhad experiences similar to this one when I was alone, it had never happened tome in a group. Observing the speed limits, with the extra stops of checkpoints,how could we have cut our driving time nearly by half?Though the distance between Mount Sinai and Cairo had not changed, ourexperience of time while we traveled the distance had. It was recorded on thewristwatches of every military man, armed guard, and passenger on the bus! Itwas as if our memories of the day, in the presence of one another, had somehowbeen squeezed into an experience a fraction of the time expected. Where was therest of our time? Clearly we were not aware of the phenomenon when it wasoccurring. The questions are, how did it happen and why?Perhaps herein we find the clue. In our innocence of anticipating theexperiences within the pyramids and speaking of the experiences as if we werealready there inside of the ancient chambers, our awareness had shifted from howlong the trip was taking to what it felt like to be there."},{"pageContent":"MEDICINELESS MIRACLEThe lights dimmed as we neared the chairs in the back of the room. Arrivinglater than expected, my wife and I found few choices remaining for two seatstogether. Facing generally toward a table at the opposite end of the ballroom,the stainless-steel chairs appeared to have been arranged rather haphazardly bythe hotel staff. Within moments of finding our seats, the class began with theusual formalities and introductions.While studying at a specialized clinic outside of Beijing, our instructor haddocumented on video the effects of an ancient healing art based on techniques ofmovement, breath, thought, and feeling. He began by preparing us for what wewere about to see. The video would show a phenomenon from Asian traditions thatWestern science could not explain. Anomalous experiences of this kind are oftenclassified as miracles. For people who had turned to this clinic as a lastresort, the choice of love, specialized movement, and the development of lifeforce (ch'i) over medicine and surgery was the answer to their prayers.Just as the light in our room disappeared, a television near our instructor camealive. My wife and I gripped the steel legs underneath our seats and scootedforward, vying for a better view of the screen. The videotape that we wereseeing had been recorded at the Huaxia Zhineng Qigong Clinic and TrainingCenter, the “medicineless hospital” in the city of Qinhuangdao, China. Thefootage began by showing a female patient lying on her back in a clinicalsetting. She appeared to be fully awake and conscious, not anesthetized, andthere were no indications that an anesthetic would be used. The woman wasloosely clothed, and her shirt had been modestly drawn up to expose her lowerabdomen. In the lights of the video and the hospital room, her stomach glistenedwith a preparatory gel that appeared shiny and wet. Seated to the patient'sright, a nurse practitioner moved an ultrasound wand across the taut, smoothsurface of the woman's stomach.Directly behind the patient were three male practitioners. Dressed in whitemedical jackets, they were standing only inches from her side. The men appearedto be very focused, standing quietly near her upper body. One of the men began amotion with his hands, silently moving them through the air above the woman'sface and chest.The video next showed the ultrasound image, allowing us to peer into the woman'sbladder during the procedure. The lining and curvature were clearly present. Inthis image, something else began to appear, something that should not have beenthere.“You are looking at a bladder cancer,” our instructor explained, “a tumorapproximately three inches in diameter inside the woman's bladder.”We were seeing the tumor as it actually appeared in that moment, captured by theultrasound wand. The camera zoomed in on the screen as we witnessed an event forwhich Western science has no explanation. Anticipating what was about to happen,our room became very still. Even the old folding chairs stopped squeaking whileour group watched, in awe, as the miracle unfolded before our eyes.While the nurse continued to monitor the event through ultrasound, the three menstanding behind the patient worked together. In unison, they participated in amode of healing that has been known for centuries. The only sound that betrayedthe process was coming from the men themselves. They repeated a single wordagain and again, a word that became louder and more intense as the healingprogressed. Loosely translated into English, they were saying “already gone,”“already accomplished.”The shift began slowly, almost indiscernibly. The cancerous form began toquiver, as if responding to some unseen force. As the movement continued, withthe rest of the image in perfect focus, the entire mass began to fade from view.Within seconds, the tumor appeared to melt before our eyes. In only two minutesand forty seconds, the tumor was gone. It had simply disappeared! A healing hadoccurred, one so complete that the ultrasound did not even indicate scarring inthe tissue that the tumor had invaded. As the camera backed away from thecomputer screen, the patient, still awake and conscious, appeared to be relievedby what she heard in the room. The nurse and the three men conferred amongthemselves, then nodded in agreement; their process had been successful.Politely, each bowed from the waist and softly clapped his hands, acknowledgingtheir accomplishment.At first, our conference room was silent. Then I heard sighs that gave way togasps and cheers for what we had witnessed. What had just happened? How had acancerous tumor, three inches in diameter, disappeared from inside the woman'sbody without even the telltale scars of such a condition, in a matter ofmoments? Why is it that Western science has no mechanism to explain such anoccurrence?Both of the previous stories are important for two reasons. First, eachillustrates a shared experience in the presence of a group, rather than theunique experience of one individual. Whatever happened to our perception of timeon that day in the Sinai Desert of Egypt, it happened to many people of varyingbackgrounds, beliefs, and faiths. There were Muslim and Christian guards as wellas Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, and Christian travelers in our group as we made ourway across the Sinai Peninsula. All of us had our own beliefs about ourrelationship to this world, and our own reasons for being in the desert thatmorning. Likewise, the disappearance of the cancer was witnessed by four peoplein the presence of the woman with the tumor. Additionally, it was recorded by acameraman, bringing to five the number of people immediately present. This was agroup experience as well.For our group on the bus, the anticipation of being in Cairo, sealed inside theGreat Pyramid for four hours of private access, was the dominant theme of theday. For many of our circle of friends, this was the culmination of a dream thatbegan in childhood and had been made possible through hard work and months ofplanning. The key to this story and the healing of the woman's cancer is thatthe group's focus was on the feeling of the outcome rather than on the feelingof how long it was taking for the outcome to occur. This is a subtle yetpowerful distinction that will be of even greater significance in laterdiscussions.The second reason I have shared these stories is that the events in eachinstance are unaccounted for in Western science at present. How are we toexplain an occurrence that we have personally experienced, such as timecompression or instantaneous physical healing, in the absence of a belief systemthat allows for such an event? Perhaps the way to answer these questions is toexplore the nature of time through the eyes of our ancestors as well as modernscience."},{"pageContent":"THE MYSTERY OF TIMESince humankind began recording the accounts of our experience in this world,time has appeared to us as a concept of intrigue. Our only method of exploringthe mysterious quality that we experience as time has been to speculate aboutits nature. Without the ability to capture, photograph, or record time itself,we are left with relative measurements of events that occur within time. Suchmeasurements are often described as “now” and “then” or “before” and “after” theevent. Indigenous traditions sometimes view time as a river, flowing in a singledirection, with the experiences of humankind in some way inextricably bound tothe life of the flow. Other traditions consider time as a road, transcending themembranes of space, that may be traveled in two directions. This perspectivesuggests that time originates somewhere and ends somewhere, leaving us to traveland experience the points between.Regardless of how we perceive the space between “then” and “now,” time hasbecome the dominant factor in the way we view our lives. Our days consist ofpreparing for our future as we plan the events of the next moment, the next day,and the following year. From seemingly insignificant events, such as where wewill have lunch in twenty minutes, to monumental milestones, such as therendezvous of two craft from two different nations in space, time is the commonthread that weaves us together through the synchronization of experiences in ourworld.In light of the prophecies regarding future possibilities, our understanding oftime may be of greater significance now than at any other point in recordedhuman history. There is an ancient school of thought, a belief that haspersisted for at least five thousand years, suggesting that time and the eventsof our future are not only inextricably related, but are consistent and knowableas well. Furthermore, this line of reasoning suggests that the catastrophicevents of prophecy, those with the potential to threaten the very existence ofour species, may be known and avoided, or, at the very least, prepared for. Afresh body of research, conducted by the leading physicists and mathematiciansof our day, now lends credibility to this line of reasoning. One thing appearsto be certain: To understand prophecy as events that happen within time, we mustfirst understand the nature of time itself."},{"pageContent":"CONFLICTING SCIENCESurprisingly, much of the same science that scoffs at miracles and prophecy hasyet to reach agreement on even the basic nature of our world. Though ourtechnology may have placed mechanized sensors on the surface of other worlds andextended our senses to the edge of our known universe, we are still uncertainabout who has come before us, and even about the age of the earth itself.For nearly one hundred years, for example, the science of physics has beenembroiled in a struggle to define the forces responsible for the events of oureveryday world—the same forces that changed the appearance of the woman's tumorand compressed our sense of time in Egypt. It is believed that, once discovered,the mechanism responsible for the events of our daily lives ultimately willdescribe the workings of the cosmos. Divided into two main camps of thinking,the theories of classical physics and quantum physics make up the landscape ofthese two possibilities.Classical physics is the set of laws that were used to explain our world untilapproximately the 1920s. Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, Maxwell's theoriesof electricity and magnetism, and Einstein's theories of relativity, forexample, had been successful in explaining the observations of everyday eventsuntil that time. Developing technologies, however, allowed scientists to lookbeyond everyday events, and there they saw expressions of nature that could notbe explained by classical physics. From the world of subatomic particles anddistant galaxies, a modified physics began to emerge to account for newlyobserved phenomena. Proposing science-fictionlike theories of time travel andparallel universes, the mathematics of such possibilities became the science ofquantum physics.In some instances, the two schools of thought were in opposition. One of thekeys to the controversy was whether the experiences of our world were producedby a predetermined sequence of events that may be known, or whether a degree ofrandomness was inherent in the process of life. In other words, if we couldidentify all of the events leading up to a given moment, would we have theinformation necessary to predict the outcome of the moment, or was there anotheragent of change that could not be accounted for in such knowledge? Stated in thepresent tense, can an event already set in motion change for no obvious physicalreason, with no apparent force acting upon it?The idea that a given outcome occurs only because of prior events is calleddeterminism. Attributed to the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, determinismstates that everything witnessed or experienced in our world, regardless of itsrandom appearance, happens because of the events that preceded it. The theory isbest described in Leibniz's own words: “Nothing takes place without a sufficientreason; that is to say, if one has sufficient knowledge, one may always explainwhy anything else happens as it does.”1 [index_split_088.html#filepos509715]In recent times, deterministic thinking has been further clarified by esteemedscientists such as Jacques Monod, Nobel Prize winner in biology in 1965. Monoddescribes his viewpoint by stating that “anything can be reduced to simple,obvious, mechanical interactions.”2 [index_split_088.html#filepos509927] Fromthese perspectives of determinism, the apparent healing of the cancerous tumoroccurred as the result of events leading up to the moment of healing. If we hadinsight on each of those events, our sense of a miracle would disappear, and wewould see the healing as the logical outcome of a known sequence of events.In the world of quantum mechanics, however, an event such as the compression oftime or the healing of a tumor offers a very different prospect. The additionalagent has been identified as “free will.”"},{"pageContent":"A NEW PHYSICSThe key to quantum physics may be found in the very name of the science itself.Quantum is defined as “a discrete quantity of electromagnetic radiation.”Physicists now speak of creation as being nonsolid and noncontinuous. Thescience of quantum physics has demonstrated that our world actually occurs invery short, rapid bursts of light. What we believe we see as the swing of abaseball batter on home plate, for example, in quantum terms is actually aseries of individual events that happen very fast and very close together.Similar to the many still images that make up a moving film, these events areactually tiny pulses of light called quanta. The quanta of our world occur sorapidly that although our eyes are capable of doing so, our minds do not discernindividual bursts. Instead, the pulses are averaged together into what we see asone continuous event—in this instance, the swing of the batter. Quantum physicsis the study of these minute units of radiating waves, nonphysical forces whosemovements create our physical world.In recent years, scientists have turned to observations in the quantum world ofthe atom to explain mysteries that have been witnessed at the farthest reachesof the cosmos. The thinking is that if an event is observed on a small scale,then perhaps the same mechanism may be applied to understand events on a largerscale. Quantum physics now allows for “miracles” such as the disappearing tumorand our experience of lost time, possibilities that were previously consideredimpossible. For example, did the vehicles and our group merely change ourperception of time, or did something even more amazing occur? Is it possiblethat on that morning in the Sinai Desert we participated in an event thatchallenges the very limits of our imaginations, the possibility of experiencingmultiple realities and jumping from one outcome into another without evenknowing that the jump occurred?If time does, in fact, travel as a road in two directions, is it possible thatthe road has multiple lanes? Could the events that begin along one lane of timearrive at a given point in a different lane with a different outcome? Can webegin one course of events and “leap” midstream into a new outcome? If so, thisimplies the possibility of multiple outcomes for an event that has alreadybegun. The implications of this kind of thinking give a new meaning of hope topredictions of worldwide destruction and global suffering and, at the same time,invite us to consider the choices we make in our daily lives as direct links tofuture experiences.The existence of many outcomes for a given event has been predicted by quantumphysicists for nearly eighty years. In recent times, scientists such as FredAlan Wolf and Richard Feynman have brought a new relevance to such esotericpossibilities by linking quantum possibilities to daily life. Of all theuncertainties in a universe of many outcomes, two components are clear. First,for multiple outcomes to be considered implies that each possibility is alreadycreated and present in our world. Perhaps in a form that we have yet torecognize, somewhere in creation, as an embryonic mix of the physical andnonphysical, each outcome awaits to be called into the focus of our awareness.Second, as one outcome gives way to another, for a brief moment the two mustoccupy the same space at the same time. As one event is brought into the focusof our senses, it must be capable of overlapping a second event, if only for thefraction of a second that it takes the two to slide past one another.Quantum physics has a name for the reality that occurs during the time that twoatoms occupy the same point, in the same space, at the same time. Such anoutcome is called a Bose-Einstein condensate, honoring the authors of theequations that predict such an occurrence. These condensates have now beenobserved and documented under laboratory conditions. Jeffrey Satinover reportsthat Bose-Einstein conditions have occurred with “condensates of up to 16million merged beryllium atoms” formed in the laboratory in the late 1990s.3[index_split_088.html#filepos510054] Moreover, Satinover reports that thematerial created from the experiments is “large enough to see with the naked eyeand has been photographed.” From these studies alone, although the eventsexperienced in the Egyptian desert and witnessed on our videotaped healingappear contrary to the laws of nature, they fall within the predicted behaviorof natural laws suggested by quantum physics.Perhaps the consideration of multiple possibilities offers insight into one ofthe great mysteries of the creation sciences—why much of our universe appears tobe “missing.” Using supercomputers to trace the steps of creation back to theBig Bang at the beginning of time, a mysterious phenomenon quickly develops.Shortly after the instant that scientists believe our universe began,approximately 90 percent of it “disappears,” leaving only 10 percent of theuniverse accounted for within the models.4 [index_split_088.html#filepos510181]At the same time, researchers in the life sciences ask us to consider a secondmystery. Studies of the human brain suggest that for a given individual, only afraction of the individual's brain is used—approximately 10 percent. Thefunction of the remaining 90 percent is unaccounted for and is believed to bedormant. Certainly there are theories as to “multiple, redundant biologicalcircuits” and a yet-to-be realized state of evolution when our brain will beutilized more completely. The numeric estimates, however, remain unexplained.Only 10 percent of the human brain is utilized, and only 10 percent of the massof the universe can be accounted for. Where is the remaining 90 percent ofcreation, and what is the purpose of our brain's “unused” 90 percent? Is it bychance that these percentages correlate so closely? What are the computer modelsand biologists showing us—or failing to show us?Neither the model nor the life scientists of the past are taking into accountone of the most fundamental and possibly least understood dynamics of creation,the component of dimensionality. In our ever-changing view of creation, manyscientists now believe that all we know as our world is ultimately made of thesame substance, tiny packets of light (quanta) vibrating at different speeds.Some light vibrates so slowly that it appears as rocks and minerals. Other formsof light vibrate more rapidly to appear as the living material of plants,animals, and people, while even faster vibrations make up our television andradio signals. Ultimately, each may be reduced to a quality of vibrating light.The observations of the physicists and the life scientists fail to take intoaccount the parameters of dimensionality—events occurring at such high vibratoryrates that they appear beyond our range of physical perception. New researchsuggests that our world does not end with the vibrations noted on conventionalcharts of cosmic waves, vibrating at over 1022 cycles per second. Cosmologistsnow suspect that shortly after the moment of creation, the universe wasexpanding so rapidly that its vibration could no longer express within the lawsof three-dimensional experience. According to this theory, 90 percent of theuniverse literally vibrated itself into higher states of expression! It is this90 percent that may represent the place where the parallel universes of quantumtheory live."},{"pageContent":"IN AND OUT OF TIME: CHOICE POINTSOften referenced in discussions of parallel possibilities are the theories ofHugh Everett III, a pioneering physicist from Princeton University. Everettdeveloped the ideas of parallel universes as an answer to the puzzles of quantumrealities. In a 1957 paper titled “Relative State Formulation of QuantumMechanics,” Everett went so far as actually to give a name to the moments intime where the course of an event may be changed. He called these windows ofopportunity “choice points.”5 [index_split_088.html#filepos510440] A choicepoint occurs when conditions appear that create a path between the presentcourse of events and a new course leading to new outcomes. The choice point islike a bridge making it possible to begin one path and change course toexperience the outcome of a new path.From this perspective, in the moment that the three practitioners and thepatient chose the view affirming that the tumor did not exist, they were movingthrough a choice point into a new outcome. By changing their belief system, theywent beyond any attempt to “heal” the physical expression of an event that hadalready occurred. Rather, they addressed the nonphysical origins of the tumorand assumed the thought, feeling, and emotion from a place where it neverexisted. Their actions became the attractor for a choice point, allowing thequantum leap from a course of events already under way, to a new course with adifferent outcome. The tools that make such a jump possible are found in theirbeliefs: the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that the new reality was alreadyin place. Contrary to the suggestion that such change occurs slowly, over longperiods, the new possibility was brought into focus, and the original released,in two minutes and forty seconds!Choice points may occur more often than we think. In our definition of quanta asthe small pulses of light that create our reality, we opened the door to atremendous possibility: a new definition of time! Just as physicists now believethat matter is made of many short bursts, rather than being one continuousfield, the ancients believed that time occurred in a similar fashion. It isduring each burst of light that we experience the events of our world. The morebursts of light we string together, the longer the duration of our experiencebecomes. Conversely, the fewer the bursts, the briefer the overall experience.For there to be an end to one pulse of light before the next pulse begins, theremust, by definition, be a space in between. Viewing our experience on earth as asmall metaphor for the large-scale experience of the cosmos (as above, sobelow), the Essenes made similar reference to the breath of our lives and thebreath of the cosmos. In the Essene Gospel of Peace, for example, we arereminded that “in the moment betwixt the breathing in and the breathing out ishidden all the mysteries.…”6 [index_split_088.html#filepos510672] In Essenephilosophy, the spaces between quantum bursts may be viewed as small expressionsof the stillness between each breath. It is in the spaces between, in thesilence between the pulses of creation, that we have the opportunity to “jump”from one possibility to the next. This space is where the miracles occur."},{"pageContent":"WHEN TIME SLOWS DOWNThe winter of 1977 seemed to have arrived suddenly in Missouri. Having beenaccepted at a university in northern Colorado to complete my degree in the earthsciences, nothing had prepared me for the seemingly endless flow of errands andpaperwork that filled each day before my departure. Perhaps it is for this veryreason that one event remains clear, standing out from all others in those veryfull days of preparation.In the week before my classes were to begin, I witnessed three separate autoaccidents on the roads and highways near our home. Though never directlyinvolved in any of the accidents, I was the first on the scene at all three. Ineach instance, I could see what was about to happen and felt powerless to doanything about it.During the third of the three incidents, I was stopped at a traffic lightentering a four-way intersection. Suddenly, from my left, I saw a small blue caraccelerate while the surrounding vehicles were slowing to honor the signal. Iglanced at the light and immediately knew what was about to happen. The womandriving the car was attempting to squeak through a yellow light. Suddenly thelight changed, and I saw something that I had not seen earlier. Another vehiclewas in the same turn lane, traveling in the opposite direction, toward thewoman's car. As the light changed to red, the car waiting in the intersectionbegan the turn, just as the blue car raced through. In an instant, the wholescene had played out.Though the entire event lasted only seconds, my experience of the moment wasmuch longer. A strange mixture of helplessness and fascination came over me as Iwatched from the safety of my own vehicle. In slow motion, I saw the two carstouch and then merge into one another. The woman driving the blue car had aninfant in the backseat, apparently with no harness or seat belt. My fascinationturned to horror as I saw a tiny child, clothed in a down jacket, with her headcovered in a stocking hat, become airborne and sail limply over the front seats.In slow motion the infant slammed into the windshield, then slid down the glassto the dash, falling into a crumpled heap on the seat. For those brief seconds,I felt the world slow to a strange crawl. Like a video playback, advancing frameby frame, the scene was so vivid, so lucid, so real.Many people have reported similar experiences, under a variety of conditions. Ishare this particular experience for a reason. During the week of the threeaccidents, culminating with the one just described, I recognized a theme commonto each experience. It was clear that I determined how I saw each event by theway I felt about what I was seeing. On the day of the third accident, forexample, my emotions of horror merged with my thoughts of fascination for whatwas occurring, and slowed my vision of the event to a snail's pace. It was as ifsomeone had shown me the entire scene imprinted upon a deck of cards, with eachimage slightly different from the one before it. In such instances, the fasterthe deck is flipped, the faster the action appears. The accident reminded me ofprecisely this metaphor, with the powers that be flipping through the deck, veryslowly. In this molasses-like effect, I witnessed the accident and rememberspecific details that, in all probability, would otherwise have gone unnoticed.On that day, my experience of quantum science transcended theory and what-ifs,to become the reality of a very tangible experience of seeing the events as wellas the spaces in between."},{"pageContent":"THE BUTTERFLY EFFECTAs strange as the ideas of quantum theories may sound, they account forobservations in subatomic experiments with such success that they have beenunmatched in nearly eight decades. It is such experiments that pave the way fornew considerations of our role in history and the fate of humankind. Fromreports in the open literature, it is obvious that researchers have seriouslystudied the possibility of observing time and influencing outcomes. What are weto do with such information? How does knowledge of this magnitude affect ourlives, day in and day out?To bring such abstract information into a meaningful role in our lives, we must,at the very least, have a conceptual understanding of how the principles work.Applying our new physics to the ancient gift of prophecy, we now have anexpanded vocabulary to describe the visions of ancient seers and the role oftheir visions in our lives. Without the benefit of such language and conceptualmodels, ancient prophets were often left with little more than a glimpse into afuture so far ahead of their time that they did not even have the words todescribe what they had seen.Perhaps our consideration of time as a roadway, moving in two directions, mayhelp in applying the concepts of prophecy previously suggested. A prophetstanding in the middle of such a roadway might apply his gift of prophecy byprojecting his senses along the road to the front, or in the opposite directionbehind. Rather than looking to the horizon for as far as the eye can see intotime, the prophet's perceptions actually travel the road into another experienceof space and time. While his body may appear in the present moment, sitting inthe chair before the fireplace of Nostradamus's study in 1532, for example, theawareness of the prophet has actually navigated the road of time into thereality of a distant future. The key to understanding prophecy is that thefuture being observed is the logical outcome of the circumstances at the time ofthe prophecy. Between the moment of the present and the time of the future, ifanything were to change, then the outcome of the prophecy must reflect thatchange.Quantum physics has given rise to a wonderful new vocabulary to describeprecisely such experiences. Descriptions that may at first appear to have verylittle to do with the science being discussed have an eloquent way of makingcomplex ideas easy to understand. The “butterfly effect” is one of thosedescriptions. Used to describe the relationship between the moment of change andthe possible outcomes stemming from that change at a later time, the butterflyeffect is formally known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Briefly,the effect states that tiny changes in initial conditions can lead to bigchanges in a later outcome. Similar to the way complex ideas were described bysimple stories in the past, a parable is used today to illustrate the butterflyeffect. The single sentence suggests, “If a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyotoday, a month later it may cause a hurricane in Brazil.”7[index_split_088.html#filepos510931]Reminding us of how significant thoughts and actions of the moment may become,the power of the butterfly effect may be graphically illustrated as a localizederror with global consequences. Is it possible that one seemingly insignificantmistake, such as a wrong turn by the driver of a foreign dignitary, for example,could ignite a global war? History witnessed precisely such an effect in theearly part of the twentieth century. The year was 1914, and the dignitary wasArchduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria. A documentary film about the origins ofthe First World War noted, “A wrong turn by the archduke's driver brought theheir to the Austrian throne face to face with [his assassin] Gavrilo Princip.”What if the driver had turned down another street, or perhaps not even driven onthat day? Although the archduke's assassination may well have come about atanother point in the timeline of history, it probably would not have occurred onthat day, in that manner. Perhaps the same mistake at a later time would havefound our world in a political climate where such a mistake would have remainedprecisely that, just a mistake.Such perspectives may serve as reminders not to underestimate the power of thebutterfly effect because of the gentleness of its namesake. Viewing propheciesfrom thousands of years in our past, the butterfly effect may explain why someappear to have been accurately fulfilled, while others seem to have missed themark entirely. When we consider that any change within the lifetime of theprophecy affects its outcome, it is amazing that visions of our time seenthousands of years ago have any resemblance whatsoever to the original vision ofthe prophet.Continuing with our road analogy, what the ancient prophets may or may not haveknown is that running in a parallel path beside each time-road that theynavigated is another road, moving at the same time, in the same direction. Nextto that road is another, and beside that another. Each road is transparent tothe others. Each road is occupied by an overlay, subtle copies of the sameplaces, events, and people in the same cities, countries, and continents. Thedifference between the roads is that the experience of each one changes slightlyin relation to its neighbor. The farther the roads become from the one theprophet is standing on, the greater the changes. For those close by, thedifferences may be so slight that one road of time is nearly indiscernible fromanother. The important thing here is that, however subtle, a difference exists.Referencing passages from the prophets of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the BibleCode, we are reminded that to change the outcome of any prophecy for the future,we must change the expression of our lives in the present. Quantum physicssuggests that the opportunity to redefine outcomes may come only at specificintervals where the roads of time bend their courses and approach other roads.Sometimes the roads move so close that they touch one another. These points oftouch are the choice points discussed earlier.In light of ancient as well as present-day prophecies, this concept of jumpingfrom one road to another at key choice points becomes the solution to ourmystery of miracles, healing, and time compression. Additionally, this ancientscience, now well-based in modern physics, offers new hope in the presence ofcatastrophic predictions for our future. The outcome previously described in theBible Code for the year 2012, for example, is accompanied by the words, “Willyou change it?” In a matrix of possibilities that began playing out over threethousand years ago, the possibility of redirecting a potentially tragic outcomewas recognized even then. The “change it” of the Bible Code, the tragic readingsfrom Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, and the prophets before them, followed byapparently conflicting scenarios of peace and redemption, are the markers ofchoice points along the road of time."},{"pageContent":"QUANTUM FUTURES OF THE HOPIIn terms that may seem more relevant to modern times, the Hopi relate similarvisions of our future, with similar opportunities to choose which outcome weexperience. Discussed briefly in an earlier chapter, Hopi traditions of peace,viewed through the eyes of quantum understandings, offer new possibilities forour lives today.Long ago, the Hopi, whose name means “People of Peace,” were given the diagramof a life plan that would guide them through this time in history. Eloquentlysimple, their plan consists of two parallel paths, parallel possibilitiesrepresenting the life choices of humankind. In the beginning, both paths appearvery similar. The upper path, however, gradually turns into a broken zigzag thatends nowhere. Those who choose this path are represented with their headsdetached, hovering over their bodies. They will experience the great shift as atime of confusion and chaos leading to destruction. The lower path continues asa level line, strong and even. Those choosing this path live to advanced agesand their crops grow strong and healthy.Approximately two-thirds of the way along the paths is a vertical lineconnecting the two. Until this intersection point is reached, the Hopi say, wemay move freely back and forth, exploring the two paths. Following this point intime, however, the choices are made and there is no return. In the words ofquantum physics, this portion of the prophecy describes a choice point, anopportunity for humanity to experience the paths of both worlds and choose whichis true for them. In the words of the prophecy, “If we hold fast to the sacredway as he [the Creator] devised it for us, what we have gained, we will neverlose. But still, we have to choose between the two ways.”8[index_split_088.html#filepos511143] Mother Nature tells us which is the rightway. “When earthquakes, floods, hailstorms, drought, and famine will be the lifeof every day, the time will have then come for the return to the true path.”9[index_split_088.html#filepos511350]The record-breaking extremes of nature witnessed in our world today suggest tothe Hopi that the time of purification is upon us. The severity of our cleansingis being determined, as our individual responses to life challenges create thecollective outcome. In a text written by a group of elders from the HopiNation,10 [index_split_088.html#filepos511477] specific events in our world areviewed as barometers of our progress in the unfolding of a greater scenario.Among the indicators are these: * • widespread starvation and malnourishment * • increases of crime and violence * • loss of clean, abundant water resources * • unprecedented breach and expansion of the ozone layer above Antarctica * • effects of technology (loss of rain forest, depletion of wildlife, and spread of nuclear weapons)It is during our time, the time indicated by phenomenal events in the worldaround us, that the belief systems of individuals and entire populations will betested. The elders of the Hopi clans described a scenario of three “greatshakings” of the earth. The first two were interpreted by elders of the tribe torepresent the first two world wars; the third shaking remains a mystery. It isunidentified, as the nature of this shaking is still being determined byhumankind. “The prophecy says the Earth will shake three times: first the GreatWar, then the second one, when the swastika rose above the battlefields ofEurope, to end in the Rising Sun sinking in a sea of blood.” The third shaking“will depend on which path humankind will walk: the greed, the comfort and theprofit, or the path of love, strength, and balance.”11[index_split_088.html#filepos511716]Clearly, such traditions recognize a direct relationship between the way weaddress the challenges of our world each day and the kind of world we experiencein our future. The chaos of change is our opportunity to refine our beliefs,honoring the portions that work, and gracefully releasing those that may nolonger serve us. It is our new, finely honed worldview of the present that willcarry us gracefully through the times of future challenge.As with the prophecies of the Essenes and Edgar Cayce, the Hopi leave us with amessage of hope. Their vision of our future concludes by admonishing us to beresponsible in the way we use the powers of our bodies and our machines. Onceagain we are reminded that the choices made each day will determine the durationand severity of our days of tribulation. With simplicity and eloquence, Hopiprophecy reminds us that the way we live our lives determines which path wefollow. The choice is ours."},{"pageContent":"BENDING TIMEA common denominator in considering many possibilities and multiple outcomes isthe reference to a substance that makes up the very fabric of creation and theforce that acts upon this substance. If there are parallel worlds ofpossibility, precisely what are these worlds made of ? The Nobel Prize–winningphysicist Max Planck shocked the world with his references to the unseen forcesof nature. In accepting the Nobel Prize for his study of the atom, he made aremarkable statement: “As a man who has devoted his whole life to the mostclear-headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as the result of myresearch about the atoms this much: ‘There is no matter as such!’ All matteroriginates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of anatom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together.…We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligentmind. This mind is the matrix of all matter.”12[index_split_088.html#filepos511884]It may be that Planck's “force” is the key to redirecting the outcomespostulated by science and predicted by ancient prophets. Perhaps Nobel laureateRichard Feynman best described the potential of predicting our future in hisnow-famous quote, “We do not know how to predict what will happen in a givencircumstance. The only thing that can be predicted is the probability ofdifferent events. We can only predict the odds.”13[index_split_088.html#filepos512099] In light of this kind of thinking, it isclear that science is seriously investigating the relationship betweennonphysical forces of the cosmos and their effect upon our physical world.The way that we attune to our possible outcomes is through our viewpoint onlife. From this perspective, every life-threatening condition of each body isalready healed, peace is already present, and every child, woman, and man of ourworld is already fed. Now we are invited to choose the quality of thought,feeling, and emotion that allows us to “bend” the waves of time and bring theseconditions into the focus of the present.> And one day the eyes of your spirit shall open, and you shall know all things.> > > > —THE ESSENE GOSPEL OF PEACE> > [images/00006.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"[images/00013.jpg]THE ISAIAH EFFECT The Mystery of the Mountain In modern biblical texts, the first visions into our future are described by theOld Testament prophet Isaiah. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, the completeness of theGreat Isaiah Scroll allows us to view the works of Isaiah as a template forunderstanding the apocalyptic prophecies of other traditions as well as glimpsesof our future from the biblical prophets. In doing so, we eliminate the tedioustask of examining in their entirety each of the four major and twelve minorbooks of biblical prophecy. This generalized approach makes it possible to viewthese ancient traditions from a high level and search for patterns of ideas,rather than focusing upon the specifics of each individual vision and how theycompare to one another. As we do so, an interesting, and perhaps unexpected,possibility surfaces.In earlier chapters we hinted at a pattern in the prophecies of Isaiah thatforecast a time of destruction, catastrophic changes, and nearly unfathomableloss of life, followed by a time of peace and healing. The elements of such aforecast are clearly present. A specific portion of his prophecies, named theApocalypse of Isaiah, offers even greater insight into the dual nature of theprophet's visions. He describes a time in his future when “the earth is pollutedbecause of its inhabitants, who have transgressed laws, violated statutes,broken the ancient covenant…. Therefore they who dwell on earth turn pale, andfew men are left.”1 [index_split_089.html#filepos512372] Isaiah goes on todescribe violent movement on earth as well as unusual behavior of our sun andmoon: “The foundations of the earth will shake. The earth will burst asunder,the earth will be shaken apart, the earth will be convulsed…. Then the moon willblush and the sun grow pale….”2 [index_split_089.html#filepos512637]Following the darkest moments in his vision of earth's future, the Apocalypse ofIsaiah takes an interesting and unexpected turn. With little indication of thechange that is about to occur, Isaiah abruptly begins to describe a verydifferent time in his future vision, a time affirming joy, peace, and life. Inthe next portion of his insight, still considered by scholars to be apocalypticin nature, he describes a time when “a new earth” is created, along with “newheavens.” It is during this time that “the things of the past shall not beremembered or come to mind. Instead there shall always be rejoicing andhappiness…no longer shall the sound of weeping be heard … or the sound ofcrying.…”3 [index_split_089.html#filepos512786]Following this sequence of events, we are led to believe that the joyous eventsfollow the tragic events, that one must precede the other in the order suggestedby the text. Why do the prophecies of Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus, the NativeAmerican elders, and others appear to be so contradictory at times, offeringwhat may be perceived as a mixed message of hope and possibility along withterrifying glimpses of death, decay, and catastrophic destruction for the sameperiod of time? Is it possible that such ancient glimpses into our future offeranother possibility so empowering and so overwhelming that even the prophets didnot realize the implications of their own visions?This is precisely the sense we get as we review the prophecy of Daniel in alater chapter of the Old Testament. Having been offered a rare glimpse into thefuture of a distant time, it appears as though Daniel did not fully understandwhat he had been shown. With no frame of reference for the things that hewitnessed in his future, how could he? Toward the completion of his excursionthrough time, the guide that has led him into the future simply suggests to him,“As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of thedays you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”4[index_split_089.html#filepos512939]As he shared his visions, was Isaiah forecasting actual events that would occurwith certainty, or was he describing insights into a quantum possibility with ameaning so unexpected that it has remained hidden until the twentieth century?When viewed through the eyes of our new physics, Isaiah's description of vastlydifferent futures for the same point in time correlate surprisingly well withmodern descriptions of quantum outcomes. In such discussions, the futuresenvisioned by Isaiah become waves of possibility rather than factual outcomes.Additionally, quantum science allows for individuals in the present to changesuch catastrophic outcomes of the future. The key is to understand when and howthe opportunities for change present themselves.The example given in chapter 1 of the mass prayer of peace on the eve of anairborne military campaign against Iraq offers a wonderful example of suchchoices. To some observers, the order to begin the attack, followed withinminutes by an order to abort the mission, made little sense, but from theperspective of the thin veil between quantum possibilities, the events of theday make perfect sense.On that evening thousands of people, in at least thirty-five countries on sixcontinents, had already agreed to join in a mass vigil of peace that was heardaround the world. Coordinated through the Internet and the World Wide Web,5[index_split_089.html#filepos513167] the prayer was supported by families,organizations, and communities as a voice of peace that transcended thepolitical boundaries of governments and nations. The vigil was not a protestagainst the bombing of Iraq or any policy, government, or situation existinganywhere in the world. Rather, the call of thousands of hearts and minds tohonor the sacredness of life became a single, unified choice echoing a simplemessage: peace in all worlds, in all nations, for all life.Within hours of the vigil, the course of events in Iraq had changed. On thatday, in full view of the world, we witnessed the power of human consciousness asit rearranged the building blocks of events that were already in motion. Ratherthan scattered pleas from individuals asking for divine intervention in asituation that appeared to be inevitable, the synchronized choice of manypeople, coordinated through the miracle of the Internet, slipped between theveils of quantum possibilities into an outcome affirming life through peace.In our uniqueness as nations, families, and individuals, on Friday, November 13,1998, we shared a common experience. Hidden in the deepest recesses of ourcollective memory like a family secret, taboo for so long that the details hadbeen lost, our prayer of peace opened the door to vast opportunities of healing,international cooperation, and our greatest expressions of love for those whomwe hold dear. On that November evening we breathed a collective sigh of reliefas we rewrote an outcome that appeared inevitable. In doing so, we witnessed ourpower to end the suffering of our world.How may we prove scientifically that during the prayer of thousands of people, anew possibility replaced the events of war that were already in motion? At thesame time, what power other than peace could possibly have moved forward in thepresence of such a prayer? With this experience in mind, what are theimplications of similar choices for the future of our world?"},{"pageContent":"ISAIAH'S MYSTERY DECODEDdFor nearly three millennia, scholars have sifted through the clues left byIsaiah for insights into what we may expect as our future. As cultures havechanged, our interpretation of his prophecy has changed as well. Translationsmade during the time of the Spanish Inquisition, for example, reflected thestringent limits imposed by the Church upon mystical interpretation. Today thelanguage of quantum science offers a new and expanded view of Isaiah's glimpsesinto our future.Perhaps the mystery of Isaiah's prophecies was anticipated at the time of theirwriting. As if inviting the people of a future time to look beyond the obvious,he writes, “For you the revelation of all this has become like the words of asealed scroll. When it is handed to one who can read, with the request, ‘Readthis,’ he replies, ‘I cannot; it is sealed.'”6[index_split_089.html#filepos513472] In this rare passage, one of the few of itskind, Isaiah makes a subtle observation about the attitude of generations tocome regarding his visions into time. He knows that the people of his future,those who “can read” his prophecy, have the ability to understand its message.They do not recognize it, however, because the context has never been revealedto them.Could Isaiah's “seal” be our discovery of the fundamental laws of creation, thevery nature of time itself ? If he was, in fact, offering such insights to ageneration of his distant future, how could Isaiah's vision be understoodwithout the elements of twentieth-century physics? At the same time, what wordscould he possibly have used in his day to convey such an empowering yet abstractmessage to future generations? The prophet offers us a clue to this apparentmystery, as he describes how the inhabitants of the earth's distant future maychoose which of his visions they experience. In doing so, Isaiah opens the doorto a path that may forever change the attitudes of humankind and, in turn,accomplish nothing less than rewriting the course of human history.Carefully, Isaiah outlines a form of behavior that allows us to escape thedarkness that he has witnessed. He begins by referring to a mystical key throughwhich the people of any generation may redirect the events that lie ahead intheir probable future. The key is identified in his vision as a “mountain.”7[index_split_089.html#filepos513672] It is within his mountain that Isaiahdescribes a “refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in distress; shelter fromthe rain, shade from the heat.”8 [index_split_089.html#filepos513823] In aparticularly interesting passage, the prophet tells of a time when, in thepresence of the mountain, “the veil that veils all peoples, the web that iswoven over all nations,” will be destroyed. Herein we find one of the firstclues to this particular prophecy. Clearly he is referring to the mountain asthe key of refuge and empowerment. Precisely what is the mountain of Isaiah'sprophecies?Some researchers believe that the reference is to a physical location, a placeof power and sanctuary for those fortunate enough to discover it. Others suggestthat Isaiah's mountain was intended as a code of sorts, a time lock to ensurethat his message would be revealed only when the principles for using suchwisdom were understood. While both of these may be a possibility, perhaps themystery of the prophecy may be explained more simply. The identification ofIsaiah's mountain may be a beautiful example of how the passage of time and theevolution of cultures has eroded the original context to such a degree that themessage has become lost, or at least obscured, in the process.Often, in modern references to ancient biblical texts, we find specific wordsmarked by a marginal note indicating that there may be additional uses,interpretations, or meanings of the word. Such is the case with the mountain ofIsaiah. In addition to the possibility of translators and languages introducingerror, at this point yet another factor disguises the original meaning: the useof metaphor and symbols. Scholars indicate that during the time of the writings,the word mountain was, in fact, symbolic and used to represent the “heavenlyJerusalem.”9 [index_split_089.html#filepos513971] Rather than a physicallocation—in this instance the city of Jerusalem—the footnotes clearly show thatthe word mountain is a metaphoric reference. Still, the meaning of a “heavenlycity” remains somewhat nebulous, until further research reveals an additionalclue. Our modern-day Bible is the product of earlier translations from theoriginal Hebrew. Cross-referencing this phrase with the precise wording in itsoriginal language, we discover an unexpected, though perhaps not surprising,meaning for the reference.In Hebrew, the word for Jerusalem is Yerushalayim. Here, the definition becomesvery clear: it means “the vision of peace.”10[index_split_089.html#filepos514120] At last the mysterious meaning of Isaiah'smessage becomes clear. Isaiah's mountain is not a physical place, but areference to the power of peace! With this clarification, we may read hisprophecy, “The vision of peace provides a refuge to the poor, a refuge to theneedy in distress; shelter from the rain, shade from the heat. In the presenceof the vision of peace, the veil that veils all peoples, the web that is wovenover all nations, will be destroyed.”This new understanding of Isaiah's prophecy offers a fresh insight into thepower of his ancient message. Having peered into key moments of our future, hewitnessed two very different and distinct possibilities: one a time of healingand one a time of destruction. Just as we would do today, the great prophetdescribed his vision in the only words that he knew, alerting us to apossibility in our future based upon a given course of events. At the same time,he admonished those who would eventually read his prophecy to reconsider choicesthat they make in their lives and, in so doing, to avoid the suffering that hewitnessed as a possible future."},{"pageContent":"THE ISAIAH EFFECTClearly, we are entering a new era of understanding the inner sciences ofprayer, prophecy, and the agents of change that Isaiah and others acknowledgedin their writings. Deceptively simple, Isaiah's prophecies remind us of twothings. First, through the science of prophecy we may glimpse futureconsequences of choices made in the present. Second, we embody the collectivepower to choose which future we experience. It is through our consideration ofothers in our daily lives that we piece together the experiences that bring ourfutures into focus. This is the Isaiah Effect—the expression of an ancientscience stating that we may change the outcome of our future through the choicesthat we make in each moment of the present.Quantum physics now gives us the language to give this sophisticated technologymeaning in our daily lives.

Just as the final shape of a sculptor's clay is determinedby the choices and movement of the artist, the theme of these ancient traditionssuggests that we are shaping the outcome and eventual fate of humankind in eachmoment of our lives.Interestingly, I have found some of the clearest references to these traditionsin documents from the Middle East, specifically the Qumran scrolls from the DeadSea area. The references speak of a lineage of wisdom so ancient that it wasalready old during the time of classical Egypt, over three thousand years ago.My sense has been that if such information did in fact exist, what betterlocation to preserve such wisdom than in the remote spiritual retreats of a landuntouched by modern technology. It would be in such a place that traditions lostto the West long ago might still remain as the daily rituals of localinhabitants. Isolated from the outside world until 1980, the secludedmonasteries of the Tibetan Plateau appeared to afford precisely such anopportunity.In April 1998, I had the privilege of facilitating a pilgrimage into thehighlands of Tibet in search of such traditions. Ironically, it was not until Ireturned from the journey that my suspicion was confirmed in writing. Withindays of arriving home in the States, I received a recently translated manuscriptof the Nazirines, a sect of the ancient Essenes. This particular text statedthat pockets of information, like ancient time capsules, had been strategicallyhidden by the Essenes during the first century A.D., to preserve the wisdom forfuture generations. Among the places clearly mentioned as a repository for suchtexts were the remote monasteries and nunneries of Tibet.With the aid of an expert on Asian cultures whom I had met in England four yearsearlier, our group was skillfully led through the Tibetan countryside intoisolated villages, hidden monasteries, and centuries-old temples. For twenty-onedays we were immersed in the presence of the Tibetan people, the sacredness oftheir lives, and the rugged magnificence of their homeland. We crossed shallowrivers on flat board rafts, negotiated washed-out roads, and experienced theeuphoria of mountain passes over 17,000 feet above sea level. Two-thirds of theway into our trip, we even found ourselves abandoning the safety of our bus foran open-bed fruit truck waiting on the other side of an impassable snow slideover four stories tall.Nearly one-third of our journey was in the mountainous area of the westernplateau. Among remote villages, nunneries, and monasteries seldom seen by peopleoutside of Asia, the people live today as they have for centuries, honoring thetraditions of their ancestors. Each time we walked into the courtyard of atemple complex, it was is if we had entered into a living snapshot of Tibetantraditions frozen in an ancient time. With each step of our journey, we weregreeted with an openness and warmth exceeding any that we could have imagined inthe strange beauty that imbues such desolation. The purpose of our pilgrimagewas to witness, experience, and document living examples of an inner technologythat I suspected was lost to the West nearly two millennia ago. Today we know afragment of this science as the inner technology of prayer."},{"pageContent":"BLESSED BY THE ABBOTA shaft of light beamed from somewhere high above the temple floor. The singleray had a curious three-dimensional quality, as if I could close my hands aroundit and climb to its source. With precision, the light sliced its way through thecool, misty air that was heavy with the smoke of countless butter lamps andincense. I turned my head to see where the light was coming from. Following thebeam from the point where it touched the slick, oil-laden floor to its source,my eyes focused on an opening high above our heads. Through a small, squarewindow I could see the intense blue of the Tibetan sky outside. Except for aminiature flashlight that I had taken from my backpack, this ray of directmorning sun was the only light in the maze of twisted corridors and dead-endpassageways. I made a mental note of the opening overhead. It would be myreference to the outside in the event there were no other corridors leadingback.With a group of twenty, my wife and I had journeyed across the rugged terrain ofthe Tibetan highlands and negotiated rock and dirt roads that were little morethan jeep trails, to be in this very place.

Lost after the time of Christ, theteachings of mystery schools, sacred orders, and esoteric sects all pointed to acommon lineage of wisdom lost approximately seventeen hundred years ago. Perhapsthe clearest evidence of these traditions is found today among the records ofthe mysterious communities described in earlier chapters, the ancient Essenes.Persistent references to the Essenes eventually led me to a series of journeysin search of direct, tangible evidence of their teachings and their relevance inour world today. By the mid 1980s, I found myself in the deserts of Egypt,trekking the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia, and upon numerous sojourns into thedeserts of the American Southwest in a search for modern evidence of their lostwisdom. My reasoning was that a teaching so universal would have been left asmore than a single isolated text or manuscript, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Assignificant as any ancient manuscripts may be, the real evidence would be foundin the history, teachings, and traditions of the people themselves. Perhaps thepossibilities are so obvious that they have been overlooked in recent times.Rather than speculate about two-thousand-year-old texts and what thetranslations may be alluding to, in the presence of indigenous peoples livingthe lost wisdom, we could actually witness their practices today. During ourtime together, we could hone our questions and verify our answers with a claritynever possible in the translations of temple walls and crumbling manuscripts.Additionally, we would gain a new respect for the caretakers of our lost wisdom,a new understanding of their culture and lives.The key to such wisdom is to find records accurate enough, held by a people longenough to remain virtually intact and undistorted today. If there really weresuch a place, if it still exists today, I reasoned, Tibet would be a good placeto begin. Isolated as Tibet has been from the rest of the world until 1980, manyof the teachings and records have remained precisely where they were placedcenturies ago. Tucked away high upon the “roof of the world,” in monasteries andnunneries 1,500 years old, the wisdom of the ancient Essene lineage shouldremain in plain view, preserved as the rituals, lives, and customs of the peopleliving there. Here we were, shuffling through the darkened corridor of one ofthose monasteries to search for ourselves.Though we had acclimated over fourteen days, the quick movements of my glancefrom side to side still created a dizzying effect. I made a conscious effort toinhale deeply, as I noticed that my breathing had become shallow and fast.Without giving my eyes time to readjust, I cautiously stepped forward toward adim light near the end of the smoke-filled corridor. Huge figures towered besideme, creating a gauntlet of sorts, as my light created a faint path toward theopening. Without stopping, I turned first to one side and then the other,illuminating the humanlike forms carved in monstrous proportions. The glow of mylight hinted at massive paintings behind each figure, murals reaching into thedarkness toward a ceiling that I could only guess was there.Suddenly my attention was drawn away from the looming figures to a faint yetfamiliar sound in the distance. Beginning as a low drone of many closely relatedsounds, the notes merged into one continuous tone. It appeared to be coming fromeverywhere at once. I continued, stepping carefully over the lumpy floor, slickfrom six hundred years of spilled oils. Monks scurrying through this passagewaywith their urns of yak butter had created a treacherous route. It was the onlyroute to the most sacred room of the monastery. The sound grew louder as Icrossed a raised wooden threshold. Stepping down to the cold floor, once again Igave my eyes a moment to adjust.The three walls of this tiny chamber surrounded me with the flickering of smallflames. Hundreds of yak butter candles in tarnished brass lamps illuminated theroom with an almost surrealistic glow. Though each lamp was small, theircombined heat made the room remarkably warm. A young monk sat in front of me,rhythmically pounding a trancelike beat as he chanted a song from the prayerbook in front of him. The voice of Xjinla,* [index_split_054.html#filepos292590]our translator, whispered in my ear. (In the Tibetan language, the suffix -la isadded to the end of a name as a sign of honor and respect. Thus, the name Xjinbecomes Xjinla.)“This is the room of the protectors,” Xjinla said. Anticipating my questionbefore I even asked, he continued. “The protectors are deities invited todiscourage dark forces that may be interested in advancing into the next room.”Following monastery etiquette, we respectfully made our way to the left, pastthe monk, to the doorway of the next room. I was the second to enter, followingthe lead of our guide. Little more than a small cube, the space seemed to bedwarfed even more by a support beam in its center.There, in the pale glow of a half-dozen or so candles, was the reason that wehad journeyed halfway around the world, traveled over two continents, crossedten time zones, and adjusted to some of the most rarefied air on earth. Seatedwith his legs skillfully positioned on thick woolen pads beneath his robes wasthe abbot of the monastery, the spiritual elder of this sect of monks. I felthonored to have even a few precious moments in the presence of this man. To myastonishment, those first moments were the opening of a time shared togetherthat would last for nearly an hour!The formalities came first. Each of us had been given a white linen scarf tooffer as a gesture of honor. We had been instructed how the scarf, called akata, should be carefully folded, handled, and presented to the abbot. Uponreceiving his gift, the abbot would either accept the scarf as a gift, or blessit and return it to the offerer.If he kept them, I remember wondering, what this man would do with ourtwenty-two scarves in his tiny office!Xjinla set the example as he offered his kata first, kneeling to the level ofthe frail-looking man seated on the pads. Bowing his head, this native Tibetanpresented his scarf as a gesture of honor, open palms up. The abbot accepted,removed, and blessed the scarf, then returned it to Xjinla, placing it aroundhis neck as he was still bowed in reverence. I was next.Approaching the abbot seated before me, I suddenly had an eerie sensation oftimelessness, that feeling which occurs during a moment when the world slows toa dreamlike crawl. In slow motion, I bowed respectfully, presented my kata, andwaited for the abbot to return my offering. What seemed like many seconds hadpassed, certainly longer than it should have taken for the prescribed ritual.Curious, I lifted my head just in time to meet the forehead of the abbot comingtoward me. Lifting his arms to position the scarf around my neck, he gentlycradled my head in his palms and touched his forehead to mine.Immediately, I felt a kinship with this man whom I had seen for the first timeonly moments earlier. The kinship quickly turned to trust, as I took the libertyto raise my eyes and look directly into his. What I know were only secondsbecame timeless. Knowing that I had deviated from the custom of keeping a bowedhead throughout the ceremony of offering, I was uncertain how my eye contactwould be received. The awkwardness lasted only briefly. The abbot demonstratedhis mastery by replacing the uncertainty of the moment with grace and ease.Looking back into my eyes, he offered a warm, gracious smile. With his gestureof openness, I knew that my time with the ceremony was complete. I also knewthat an opening had occurred, an opportunity to explore this man's memories andthe experience of his teachings. It was time for the next person."},{"pageContent":"SECRET OF THE PRAYERFollowing twenty similar blessings, the abbot sat back quietly on his pads,closed his eyes, and focused on our meeting. This was the time that we hadwaited for. I had asked for an audience with this holy man specifically for thepurpose of tapping into his ancient lineage of wisdom. If the Essenes had, infact, migrated into Tibet after the time of Christ, elements of Essenetraditions should be recognizable in the Tibetan rituals of today. UnderXjinla's skilled guidance, I posed the questions that I had journeyed halfwayaround the world to ask.“Xjinla,” I began, “please ask the abbot about the prayers that we havewitnessed during our time in the monasteries. Will he describe for us what isinvolved during a prayer, and how each prayer is accomplished?” Xjinla looked atme, as if waiting for the rest of the question.“Is there more?” he asked. “Perhaps I am not understanding the question that youhave asked.”There are many words in the Tibetan language that do not translate directly to asingle word in English. To communicate concepts, it is often necessary to createa phrase or short sentence in our language to describe the Tibetan equivalent. Isensed that this was one of those moments. Gathering my thoughts, I restated thequestion in the simplest English that I could muster without changing the intentof my question: “Specifically, when we see the chants, tones, mudras, andmantras on the outside,” I asked, “what is happening with the person praying, onthe inside?”Xjinla turned to the abbot, who was patiently awaiting my question, and theprocess began. Sometimes the abbot would close his eyes and discourse for manyminutes at a time in response to a single sentence from Xjinla. At other timeshe would mutter a short phrase accompanied by a gesture or a sigh. Xjinla didhis best to convert the abbot's explanation of a subtle experience into theEnglish equivalent before sharing the translation. Hearing our revised question,the abbot looked at me with the hint of a grin on his face. There are somesounds that need no translation.“Aaaahhhh…,” he said in a thoughtful tone.I knew from the tone of his voice that our question had cut directly to the verycrux of what was practiced in his monastery and others that we had seenthroughout our journey. His grin became a smile as he pursed his lips and made adifferent sound.“Mmmmmm …” I watched as his eyes rolled toward the ceiling, which was blackenedfrom the soot of uncounted butter lamps, over hundreds of years. He fixed hisgaze on an invisible place above. Using the spot on the ceiling as a point offocus, the abbot searched for the words to acknowledge the essence of myquestion. I remember thinking that what I had asked was the equivalent of askingsomeone to describe the meaning of life in twenty-five words or less. This man,who had no knowledge of my background, spiritual foundation, religiousorientation, or intent, was searching for a way to honor my question. He waslooking for a place to start.“Now we are getting somewhere,” I thought to myself. “What can I do to help theabbot be more at ease with my question?” Thinking back to translations of Essenemanuscripts from the Dead Sea, I considered the language that was usedtwenty-five hundred years ago to describe the lost technology of prayer. Thefocus of their texts was on the actual elements of prayer: thought, feeling andbody. The last thing that I wanted to do was suggest an answer to the abbot.Carefully, I restated my question.“Xjinla,” I asked, momentarily interrupting the abbot's train of thought, “morespecifically, I am interested in how the prayer is created. When we see theoutward expressions of prayers in the chanting halls, what is the result? Whereare the prayers taking them?”The abbot looked on, anxious for Xjinla to share with him my new, rephrasedquestion. Quickly, in a remarkably short sentence, Xjinla did precisely that. Iknew that our persistence was getting us somewhere. Without even thinking, theabbot exclaimed a single word. Then he said the word again, followed by a burstof Tibetan language sounding very different from phrases that I had studied inthe language books. Quickly, I gave up my attempts at translation. While Iwatched the abbot and gave him my eyes, the attention of my mind was focusedupon Xjinla. I could almost see the process in his mind. Rather than converteach of the abbot's words from Tibetan into English, he would listen to thetheme of the idea and then punctuate the response with specifics from the abbot.“Feeling!” Xjinla said. “The abbot says that the object of each prayer is toachieve a feeling.” The abbot's head was nodding up and down as if he understoodXjinla's translation. “The outward motions that you see are a display ofmovements and sounds that are useful in achieving the feeling,” Xjinlacontinued. “They have been used by our ancestors for centuries.”Now the smile was on my face. While I had suspected that the nebulous force of“feeling” was a factor in the Tibetan prayers, for the first time my belief wasbeing confirmed. The abbot was telling us that feeling was more than just afactor in prayer. He emphasized that feeling is actually the focus of eachprayer!Immediately, my mind raced back to the Essene texts. In the words of their time,those ancient writings brilliantly describe an experience that we consider todayas a form of prayer. Just as the teachings of the Essenes referred to thecreative forces of our world as angels, the language that they used to speak tothe angels they named “communion.” Today we call the same language “prayer.”Through the lost texts of the Essenes we are reminded that through our communionwith the elements of this world, we are afforded access to the great mysteriesof life. “Only through communion with the angels of the Heavenly Father will welearn to see the unseen, to hear that which cannot be heard, and to speak theunspoken word.”A silence fell over the tiny room as we thought about the abbot's words. Itwould take a nun or monk years of training, scholarship, and direct experiencebefore he or she would be allowed to have a similar conversation. The abbotseemed a little surprised at the questions that we were asking. As if he hadheard my thoughts, once again Xjinla spoke before I had formulated my nextsentence.“Your questions are very different from those of others who have found thismonastery,” he said.“Really?” I answered, somewhat amazed. “If others have taken the time to travelfrom the West into Lhasa, acclimate over two miles above sea level for a week orso, then breathe endless clouds of dust while navigating jeep trails carved intothe sheer face of cliff walls to find this monastery at fifteen thousand feet inthe Himalayas, what other kinds of questions would they ask?”Xjinla laughed at the intensity of my question. The sound of his voice broke thesilence as his laughter echoed off of the walls and reverberated through thecountless chapels that continued from our room down the hallway.“Normally, questions are in regard to the age of the monastery, what the monkseat, or the age of the abbot himself !”With that, we both laughed and looked back to the abbot, automaticallyestimating his age in our minds. I thought to myself, This man has no age. Inthese mountains, in this monastery, age has no meaning for him. He simply is. Ilooked back to Xjinla. Following our last exchange, the abbot had remained inhis position, seated with his legs drawn up underneath his heavy robes. The airin the room was cool, although my body was hot from the exhilaration of ourdialogue. I looked at the miniature keychain thermometer dangling from thezipper flap on my wife's backpack. It read fifty-five degrees Fahrenheit. Iwondered if it could be correct.An attendant chose the opportunity of silence to relight the mounds of incensethat provided relief from the pungent odor of spoiled yak butter smoldering inthe lamps and dishes. Slipping a hand under my jacket, I touched the threelayers of clothing that I had worn from the bus outside. I was amazed. My shirtswere soaked! Each day in Tibet is like summer and winter: summer in the sun andwinter in the shadows, shade, and inside of monasteries. I looked behind me justin time to see a gust of wind howl down the dimly lit corridor, whipping pilesof straw and dust into small heaps in the corners."},{"pageContent":"THE ABBOT'S MESSAGEMy hand reached up to wipe the perspiration from my eyes as I asked Xjinla thenext question. I began by explaining why we had come to the abbot's monastery,and our intent in asking what we had asked. Looking directly at the abbot, Iconcluded with a single question.“If there was one message that he could share with the people of the earth,” Ibegan, “what would the abbot like for us to carry to the world outside of Tibeton his behalf ?”Even before Xjinla had finished translating, from his cramped position at theend of our poorly lit sanctuary, the abbot began speaking. I felt Xjinla'sintensity, sometimes bordering upon frustration, as he searched for the Englishto convey what the ageless man was saying. On several occasions I would ask thatthe words be repeated or clarified. Often I would restate the translation in myown words, allowing Xjinla's expertise to help me through any inaccuracies.Turning to me specifically, his eyes betrayed what was happening within him. Isensed within Xjinla an acute awareness of his responsibility to communicate theabbot's words accurately. Together the three of us worked through the next fewmoments to be certain of what the abbot was offering.“Each time we pray individually,’ the abbot says, ‘we must feel our prayer. Whenwe pray, we feel on behalf of all beings, every- where.'” Xjinla paused as theabbot continued his reply. ‘We are all connected,’ he said. ‘We are allexpressions of one life. No matter where we are, our prayers are heard by all.We are all the same one.'”Rather than answering my question directly, I sensed that the abbot was pavingthe way, laying the foundation for his response. Nodding in agreement, my bodylanguage conveyed what my skills of Tibetan language did not: I heard, Iunderstood, and I was prepared for the rest of the answer. As to what message wecould carry to the world outside of Tibet, the abbot responded passionately.Though his words were being conveyed through Xjinla, his tone and the languageof his body were clear. Motioning toward us with a palms-up gesture from hisheart, the abbot's hands spoke a language of their own. He looked directly at meas I listened to Xjinla carefully.“Peace is of the greatest importance in our world today,” he continued. “In theabsence of peace, we lose what we have gained. In the presence of peace, allthings are possible: love, compassion, and forgiveness. Peace is the source ofall things. I would ask the people of the world to find peace in themselves, sothat their peace may be mirrored in the world.”Each word became a source of amazement to my intellect, as well as a source ofjoy to my soul. The answers that the abbot shared were the same concepts, insome instances nearly the same words, as were recovered from the Dead Sea textsof the Essenes, written over 2,500 years ago! Through the Essene Gospels ofPeace, for example, the Essenes begin a lengthy discourse on peace by openingwith a single eloquent passage. The teaching simply begins with the statement,“Peace is the key to all knowledge, all mystery, all life.”It was clear to each member of our group how important it was to the abbot thathe be heard and understood. His patience with our direct and sometimes redundantquestions was remarkable. For nearly an hour he remained cross-legged in a lotusposition, seated upon the small stack of thin, maroon-colored pads thatinsulated him from the cold stone floor of the ancient monastery. The rapidfirequestioning eventually gave way, once again, to the silence of pondering ourexchanges. For each person in the room, our time together had been both intenseand heartfelt.Our audience with this holy man, who had devoted his entire life to pursuingwisdom in an ancient monastery high in the Himalayas, became our invitation toreconcile the experience within our lives. This man had graciously received usinto the tiny quarters of his private study, and his patience with our questionstouched me deeply. Again a silence filled the room. The abbot's eyes closed.This time, however, his chin dropped to his chest as he placed his hands in aposition of prayer, palms and fingertips touching, pointed toward the ceiling.Holding the position with his hands, he touched his thumbs lightly to hisforehead and held the position. That is the last image I have of the abbot.He appeared to be fatigued, perhaps from entertaining these twenty-twoWesterners who had appeared unannounced in his monastery. As if a silent signalhad been given, we knew that our time with the abbot was complete. Almost inunison, we began to untangle ourselves from the intricate positions that hadallowed each person in the room a direct view of this beautiful man of ancientlineage. One by one, we stood silently, stretched, and, after speaking ourrespectful “Namaste,” filed out into the darkened hallway."},{"pageContent":"ROOM OF KNOWLEDGEAs we retraced the footsteps that had led us to the abbot's quarters, again weheard the sound of a low, almost indiscernible drone in the distance. It was thenow-familiar sound of many monks in a resonant room, creating the monotone chantused in Tibetan prayer. Each person perceives the sound differently. For me thetone hovers between the threshold of hearing through my ears and actuallyfeeling the sound in my body. It appears to vibrate from somewhere in the centerof my chest. Once one has heard the sound, it is unmistakable. In this moment,it sounded far away.Sunlight illuminated the end of the hallway as we approached a narrow ladder ofwooden stairs. There was no railing for support, and we immediately assumed theposition that had worked well in similar instances at other monasteries.Strapping down our backpacks and handing cameras, bottles of water, and loosegear to one another, we freed our hands to go down the rough-hewn timbers ofeach step, backwards. The stairs were at such a steep angle that few werewilling to look down as they descended the ladder in a forward position. Modestysometimes goes right out the window during such maneuvers. Traveling with asmall group under primitive conditions for days on end, the modesty of newfriendships had already given way to familiarity within our virtual family.Those on the ground reached up to guide the person on the ladder to a place ofsafe footing, often supporting whatever portion of the body descended the ladderfirst. One at a time, each person was lowered to the hardened mud floor below.A young monk perhaps fourteen years old had been waiting for us in a smallantechamber behind the ladder. As the last person touched the ground andreadjusted himself, we addressed the monk with the traditional greeting oft'ashedelay. The monk surprised us with a few sentences of broken English. Hewas very interested in our audience with the abbot, just moments before.Apparently our visit was rare, and it was difficult even for the monks inresidence to be graced with such an opportunity.By this time, Xjinla had found his way down the ladder as well, and took chargeof the conversation. Following a few moments of formalities, I asked about theexistence of ancient libraries within this particular monastery. I knew thatamong the many gifts that the Tibetans have kept safe in our world, they aremeticulous recordkeepers. The beauty of this is that they appear to documentwithout placing judgment on what they are recording. Perhaps it is their abilityto live compassion in all that they do that allows their unbiased recording ofthe world around them. In the absence of a “right” or “wrong” regarding theevents that they have experienced, they simply record what they have witnessed.Through their documentation of the events that were meaningful in their lives, Isuspected that perhaps there would be written records of the wisdom that theabbot had shared. I was particularly interested in the mode of prayer based infeeling.We were led through a series of passageways to a darkened room behind the myriadaltars. Massive statues representing the many aspects of Buddha flanked eachhallway and continued into yet another “room of the protectors.” Here we couldbarely make out the figures of immense proportions upon the walls that glistenedwith the residue of butter lamps. Knowing that this monastery was over fifteencenturies old, I suspected that the soot had accumulated for at least severalhundred years. For a radius of eighteen feet or so, the flickering strobelikeeffect of each lamp betrayed a scene of demons and dark forces. Closerinspection showed that each was engaged in combat with the forces of light, inancient metaphors mirroring the tests, successes, and failures of every humanthrough our earthly life.Stooping through an opening into another dimly lit room, my eyes adjusted to avery different scene. Of all the beauty and experiences that had filled our daysfor the two preceding weeks, what I witnessed in this moment was worth theentire journey. Stacked from the floor to the ceiling, perhaps thirty feet abovemy head, disappearing into dark corridors and scattered among shelves coveredwith dust measured in fractions of an inch, were books. Rows upon rows of books.Some were neatly stacked. Some were haphazardly thrown upon others, falling intorandom heaps. Many of the books were so jumbled and disorganized that it wasimpossible to tell where one row ended and another row began. Noticing myamazement at the disarray, the young monk spoke to Xjinla. Except for the gaspsof awe and amazement, these were the first words that we had heard sinceentering the room. I suspected he was offering an explanation. Xjinla turned tome and spoke. “The soldiers ransacked this room looking for jewels and gold.”“The soldiers!” I exclaimed. “Do you mean the soldiers from the revolution in1959? Surely others have been in this room since that time. It has been nearlyforty years.”“Yes,” Xjinla answered, “those are the ones. Others have come to these rooms.They have been few. The monks believe that the soldiers brought bad fortune.Their spirits are left here, held in place by the protectors.”My eyes searched for a meaningful place to begin investigating as I steppedforward into one of the corridors. Holding my flashlight up high, for as far asmy eyes could see there were hundreds of manuscripts, texts printed and bound intraditional Tibetan fashion. Each book began as a long, narrow cover of wood oranimal hide. The rigid coverings varied in size, averaging perhaps twelve incheslong by three to four inches wide. Another cover of similar description formedthe top of the book, with the pages stacked between the two, as loose sheets ofcloth, paper, or yak hide. The entire text was bound to keep the pages fromfalling out. Sometimes the bindings were elaborate, with brightly colored silkand linen. Sometimes they were simply held together with leather thongs.The young monk nodded with approval as I reached up to examine one of the texts.I had chosen a book that was already unwrapped, so as to disturb as little aspossible in the library. To my disappointment, and not to the monk's surprise,the pages of the book were so delicate that they crumbled at my touch. Our youngguide was obviously moved by our excitement at his library. Apparently fewpeople knew of its existence, and even fewer visited it. I turned to Xjinla andasked what were contained within these documents. Were they simply many copiesof a single text, perhaps the teachings of Buddha? Was there more? By this time,our group had spread out. Each person was exploring a different aisle ofdifferent texts, sensing that something rare and wonderful was held in the pagesof these ancient books. Without turning to face the monk, Xjinla shouted myquestion out loud. Without hesitating, the young monk smiled. He and Xjinlaexchanged a few words before Xjinla offered a response to my question.“Everything,” he said. “The monk says that within the writings in thisparticular room are records of everything.”Stopping to face Xjinla, I held my light to show just enough of our faces sothat we could see one another speak. “What do you mean, ‘everything'?” I asked.“What does ‘everything’ include?”Xjinla began, “Written into the pages of these books are the teachings andexperiences that have touched the people of Tibet for centuries. As far back asanyone can remember, the wisdom of great mystics has found its way here to bepreserved for future generations. In the pages of these books lie thefoundations of many philosophies, from Tibetan Bon and Buddhist writings toChristian ones, and those explained by the abbot. All is recorded here in thebooks that surround us as far as our eyes can see.”I knew that each monastery was a school of sorts. Designed to preserve thesecret traditions of the ages, each school specialized in one particular form ofwisdom. Our journey had already taken us to monasteries that focused on thetraditions of combat and martial arts, for example. Other monasteries preservedthe wisdom of telepathy and psychic studies, debate, or the healing arts. Thefocus of this particular school was the preservation of knowledge. Withoutprejudice or judgment, information was simply recorded and stored upon thefragile pages of countless numbers of books, such as the ones we were seeingbefore us.This is the reason that we have come, I thought to myself. Here we have seen thetraditions of prayer and have the opportunity to document them through textswritten by those practicing these traditions nearly two thousand years ago. Thismoment is worth the entire journey, and I know that there is more to come!In their texts, the Essenes had referred to a mode of prayer that is notaccounted for by prayer researchers today. Here, in a cold monastery located inthe remote mountains of western Tibet, I had witnessed this prayer and was shownsources documenting its history and origin. As the translations continued thatday, my sense was confirmed that the Tibetans were continuing, at least in part,a lineage of wisdom whose elements predated history.

Perhaps this offers a clue as to whyso many people appear to have lost their faith in prayer. After the biblicaledits of the fourth century, details underlying the language of prayer graduallyfaded from the traditions of the West, leaving only the words behind. Duringthis era, many began to believe that the power of prayer lived in the spokenword alone. Revelations from the pre-fourth-century texts, however, remind usthat there are no magic codes of vowels and consonants that open doorways intoforgotten realms. The secret of prayer lies beyond the words of praise, theincantations, and the rhythmic chants to the “powers that be.” Through textssuch as the Dead Sea Scrolls, we are invited to live the intent of our prayer inour lives, for if the words are “spoken only with the mouth, they are as a deadhive … which gives no more honey.”1 [index_split_090.html#filepos514345]"},{"pageContent":"TO SPEAK THE UNSPOKEN WORDThe power of prayer is found in a force that cannot be spoken or transmitted asthe written word—the feelings that the prayer's words evoke within us. It is thefeeling of our prayers that opens the door and illuminates our paths to theforces of the seen as well as the unseen. Though other ancient references oftenallude to this aspect of our communion with creation, the abbot in Tibetactually confirmed the feeling element of prayer during our private audience.In answering my question about what was happening within the monks and nuns aswe witnessed the outward expression of their prayers, the abbot had respondedwith a single word: feeling. The outward expressions of prayer that we witnessedin the monasteries of Tibet were a display of the movements and sounds that thenuns and monks used to achieve the feelings within. Carrying his answer one stepfurther, the abbot then said to us that feeling was more than just a factor inprayer. He emphasized that feeling is the prayer!Through our communion with the elements of this world, we are given access tothe great mysteries of life, the opportunity “to see the unseen, to hear thatwhich cannot be heard, and to speak the unspoken word.” In its purest form,prayer has no outward expression. Though we may speak a prescribed sequence ofwords handed down for generations, they must generate a quality of feelingwithin us in order to touch the world around us. At best, any words that wechoose to speak our prayers out loud can be only an approximation of the feelingthey describe within. How could the great masters teach of such feelings twothousand years ago? How are we to share them today?Often, when I am asked to speak to groups about the possibility of prayer, aquestion arises that reminds me of a conversation I had with my mother yearsago. One evening, as we spoke on the telephone between brief visits and acrossseveral time zones, I was sharing insights into a new workshop that I hadprepared on the science of compassion. As I offered a definition of prayerinvolving feeling and emotion, my mother asked a question that has been echoedby many people in many situations since that time. Openly and innocently, shesimply said, “What is the difference between emotion and feeling? I alwaysthought that they were the same.”I was interested to hear my mother's understanding of these sometimes nebulousexperiences that play such a key role in defining our lives. Not surprisingly,her explanation resembled the definitions commonly accepted in the West today.For example, some dictionaries consider the two words nearly interchangeable,using each one to define the other. In The American Heritage Dictionary of theEnglish Language, the word feeling is defined as “an emotional state ordisposition; a tender emotion.” (In the same text, emotion is defined in oneplace as “a strong feeling” and in another as a synonym for feeling.) Whilethese definitions may serve the purposes of today's world, the ancientsrecognized a distinction between them. Further, though closely related, thoughtand feeling are identified as discrete elements, keys, which may be focused toeffect change in the conditions or our bodies, our world, and beyond."},{"pageContent":"AS ABOVE …In an account twenty centuries old, the people of the Holy Land asked theirleaders a question that continues to ring in our minds today. Except forspecifics of the conditions, the question remains hauntingly similar. Withregard to peace in our world, those who have come before us asked, “How, then,may we bring peace to our brothers… for we would that all of the Sons of Menshare in the blessings of the angel of peace?”2[index_split_090.html#filepos514604] Essene masters offered a reply illustratingthe role of thought, feeling, and the empowering nature of prayer. Defying thelogic of today, their words remind us that peace is more than simply the absenceof aggression and war. Peace transcends the end of a conflict or a statement ofpolicy. While we may force the outward appearance of peace upon a people or anation, it is the underlying thinking that must change to create a true andlasting peace. In words that sound surprisingly Buddhist as well as Christian innature, the Essene masters replied that “three are the dwellings of the Son ofMan.… They are his body, his thoughts, and his feelings…. First shall the Son ofMan seek peace with his own body.… Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with hisown thoughts.… Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with his own feelings.”3[index_split_090.html#filepos514780]The ancients offered eloquent insight into a way of thinking that allows us toredefine what we experience on the outside by addressing what we have become onthe inside. Similar in some respects to the philosophies of Western healthpractices, one school of medicine brings about change by attacking the conditionof illness itself. This approach eliminates foreign bodies with chemicals, orsurgically removes the organs and tissue that appear diseased. A second schoolof thought looks beyond the outward expression of our body's appearance to theunderlying factors that may be source of the condition, where the unseen forcesof thought, feeling, and emotion become the blueprint to understanding andchanging the conditions of our lives that no longer serve us.To change the conditions of our outer world, we are invited to actually becomethe conditions of our desire from within. When we do so, the new conditions ofhealth or peace are mirrored in the world around us. This is essential to theEssene passage offered previously. To bring peace to those whom we love in thisworld, we must first become that very peace. In the language of their time, theauthors of the Dead Sea Scrolls even offer insights into the technology thatallows this healing quality of peace: it must occur in our thoughts, feelings,and bodies. What a powerful and empowering concept!As I share the Essene passages in group settings, I watch the faces of theaudience from my vantage point at the front of the room. The change beginsslowly at first. While some people simply record the words in their notebookswith little display of emotion, others become excited as they immediately graspthe significance of the ancient teachings. There is a magic that occurs invalidating current ideas through manuscripts left by those walking the same pathand seeking the same validations over two thousand years ago.Through their insights, the Essene elders made clear distinctions among emotion,thought, and feeling. While closely related, thought and emotion must first beconsidered independently, then merged into a union of feeling that becomes thesilent language of creation. The following descriptions of each experience arekeys leading us into the heart of our lost mode of prayer.EMOTIONEmotion may be considered the source of power that drives us forward toward ourgoals in life. It is through the energy of our emotion that we fuel our thoughtsto make them real. In itself, however, the power of emotion may be scattered andwithout direction. It is in the presence of thought that our emotion is givendirection, breathing life into the image of our thoughts.Ancient traditions suggest that we are capable of two primary emotions. Perhapsmore accurately, we may say that through our lives we experience variousconditions that resolve to a single emotion. Love is one extreme of suchconditions. Whatever we have come to believe is love's opposite is the secondextreme, often described as fear. The quality of our emotion determines how itis expressed. Sometimes flowing, at other times lodged within the tissues of ourbody, emotion is closely aligned with desire, the force that drives ourimagination to resolution.THOUGHTThought may be considered the guidance system that directs our emotion. It isthe image or idea created by our thought that determines where our emotion andattention are directed. Thought is closely associated with imagination.Surprisingly to many people, in itself thought alone has little energy; it isonly a possibility with no energy to give it life. This is the beauty of purethought. In the absence of emotion, there is no power to make our thoughts real.It is our gift of thought in the absence of emotion that allows us to model andsimulate the possibilities of life harmlessly, without creating fear or chaos inour lives. It is only in our love or fear for the objects of our thoughts thatwe breathe life into the creations of our imagination.FEELINGFeeling may exist only in the presence of thought and emotion, for it representsthe union of the two. When we feel, we are experiencing the desire of ouremotion merged with the imagination of our thoughts. Feeling is the key toprayer, as it is our feeling world to which creation responds. As we attract orrepel the people, situations, and conditions that we find in our experience, wemay look to our feelings to understand why.To have a feeling, by definition we must first have both an underlying thoughtand an emotion. The challenge in developing our highest levels of personalmastery is to recognize what thoughts and emotions are represented as ourfeelings.From these three brief and possibly oversimplified definitions, it becomesapparent why it is impossible to “think away” frightening and painfulexperiences. Thought is only one component of our experience, the “seeing” inour mind of possible outcomes. Pain, however, is a feeling, the product of ourthought fueled by our love or fear for what our mind believes has occurred. Withthis formula in mind, the Essene masters invite us to heal the memories of ourmost painful experiences by changing the emotion of the experience itself.As an ancient basis for the modern axiom “energy follows attention,” a conciseparable from the lost Gospel Q describes this concept: “Whoever tries to protecthis life will lose it.” These few deceptively brief words explain why wesometimes attract into our lives those experiences that we least choose to have.In this example, as we prepare and defend ourselves against each possibility andevery situation where we could lose our lives, the model suggests that we areactually drawing attention to the very experience that we are choosing to avoid.In the not wanting, we create the conditions that allow it to be. Rather thanfocusing our attention on what we do not want, a higher choice is found inidentifying that which we choose to bring into our lives, and living from thatperspective. Affirmations provide a beautiful example of precisely thisprinciple.In recent times, affirmations have become very popular with followers of somespiritual and esoteric teachings. In these traditions it is suggested that byaffirming the things that we choose to experience in our lives, often many timeseach day, they will come to pass. As a rule of thumb, the less cluttered theaffirmation, the clearer the effect. The words of our affirmations often echo adesire for life change, such as, “My perfect mate is manifesting for me now,” or“I am abundant, now and in all future manifestations.”I know people who carry their affirmations to the level of a serious discipline.They begin preparing for their day in the bathroom with Post-it notes all aroundthe mirror, reminding them of their affirmations. As they drive to work in themorning, the notes continue on the dashboards of their cars and hang from theirrearview mirrors. In their offices at work, on their desks, bulletin boards, andstuck to the screens of their computers are even more notes, each note servingas a vigilant reminder of those things that they chose to have, change, or bringinto their lives.Clearly, affirmations have opened powerful doors for some people. For the firsttime, individuals have begun to feel empowered and responsible with regard tothe events of their lives. For some people, their affirmations have obviouslyworked. For many, however, they have not. After months of countless reiterationsof creative reminders with no result, they have simply stopped sayingaffirmations. Our ancient model of thought, emotion, and feeling may help thosepeople to understand what has happened or failed to happen."},{"pageContent":"WHEN PRAYER DOESN'T WORKRecently I conducted an informal survey among seminar participants regardingprayer. The results of each survey were used to provide a modern-day example ofthe nature of prayer for that particular audience. I began each survey by simplyasking the audience, “When you pray, what do you find yourself praying about?”Standing in front of a flip chart, I recorded the many and varied scenarios thatmembers of each group described. After six months of these informal surveys,from audiences representing a cross-section of ethnic, geographic, andage-defined backgrounds, four broad categories of prayer emerged from thedescriptions: more money, better jobs, better health, and better relationships,in precisely that order.[images/00016.jpg] Applying our model of prayer as thought, feeling, and emotion, we may explorewhy our prayers work and what happens when they do not. For example, at the topof our list, the most common prayer noted was for “More Money.” To have a prayerabout “more money,” we must first have perceptions about the money that wealready have. Filling in the blank spaces as we move across the table to theright offers insight into the quality of those perceptions.When I asked the audiences to describe their thoughts about money when they askfor more in prayer, the answers flew back to me from throughout the room. Notsurprisingly, they were similar in nature. Such phrases as “not enough,” “needmore,” and “running out” were common. Quickly I recorded the words that theaudience shared under the heading “Thought.”Earlier, we identified thought as our guidance system, the directional programfor the energy that we move in our world. Without the power to fuel our thought,it may exist indefinitely as a possibility in our mind. The potential of thoughtin the absence of the energy to fuel our thought, we know as a wish. For ourthought to become empowered, we must give it energy. Perhaps this is the answerto why our prayers sometimes appear to go unanswered. In the absence of thepower to bring our affirmations and prayers to life, they may exist indefinitelyas potential: well-intentioned wishes.It is our gift of emotion that empowers the possibility of our wish. Recognizingthat we may choose love or fear as the emotion that fuels our thought, moreoften than not our perceived need for anything is based in fear. When we say we“need more,” that there is “not enough,” or that we are “running out of,” fearis generally the emotion driving such statements. Acknowledging that there maybe exceptions, I placed the word “fear” at the head of the “Emotion” category inour chart. From these outwardly simple elements of prayer, we gain tremendousclarity into the mechanism of how and why our prayers work as they do.Addressing each audience with the results of its chart, I would pose a question:“When we merge the emotion of fear into the thought of ‘not enough,’ what is thefeeling that we get?”The response was usually silence. I was not surprised, because the feeling isdifferent for everyone. The word that we use to describe the feeling isunimportant. What is important is the feeling.“Go ahead,” I ask again, “what does it feel like when you think that you have nomoney and your emotion is one of fear?“Yuck!” I hear from somewhere in the room.“Crummy!” someone else exclaims.“Precisely,” I reply. “That is precisely the point.” We choose the conditions ofour lives through our feelings, the invisible union of our thoughts andemotions. As we imagine an outcome in our mind's eye and become aware of theemotion that is fueling our imagination, our feeling is created. To understandwhat we have created, we are invited to simply look at the world around us. Howare we to create money, relationships, and health if the feelings that empowerour creation are “crummy” and “yuck”? Feelings of unworthiness fuel the creationof the very experience we least choose to have in our lives, the expression ofnot being worthy. Nearly every person in the room has heard the principles ofthe exercise before. What is new, perhaps, is the opportunity actually tounderstand what has happened to our prayers in the past. That is where ourhealing begins.Working through such exercises together, on an inexpensive flip chart, in lessthan ten minutes, it becomes possible to illustrate the mechanism for what maybe the greatest power in creation. Lost to the West a millennium and a half agois the joy that comes from remembering our power to bring wellness, abundance,health, security, and joy to our lives, and have fun doing it! In addition toidentifying how our inner technology of prayer works, we now have a way tochange the elements of our prayer to better serve us in the future.Immediately the realization would settle over each audience. First I would heara sigh. Then another, and another. Each became punctuated with giggles ofnervous laughter—perhaps an unconscious effort to dispel the intensity of themoment. Looking into the faces of each audience, I had the privilege of watchingthe miracle begin."},{"pageContent":"THE SOUP OF CREATIONI have learned many things from many people, in a variety of settings over theyears. Though each audience is unique, there are consistent threads that appearto be universal, weaving each group within each city into the common experienceof one family. The asking of a question is one of those threads. As one personfinds the courage to ask a question, others in the room are asking the samequestion as well, perhaps on unspoken levels. Some people may be aware of theirquestion, but are simply shy about asking in a group setting. For others, it isnot until they hear the words that they respond, “Yes, I've wondered about that,too.” I savor those moments. The opportunity to interact and draw new clarityfrom one another is where our great moments of communication begin.During one of the first opportunities that I had to present the concepts ofprayer in a workshop situation, a gentleman close to the front of the room letout a moan that the whole room could hear. He had definitely gotten myattention! Looking his way, I saw a grimace of uncertainty on his face.Searching for a way to acknowledge the man's frustration without singling himout specifically and, perhaps embarrassing him, I turned to the audience ingeneral and asked, “Are there questions?”The man in the front of the room immediately seized the opportunity. Perhaps inhis mid-thirties, he had one elbow on the table that he shared with the othersin his row. His chin was resting casually on his hand, palm up, opened under hisjaw. As I walked in his direction to honor his question, he placed his pencil onthe table next to his notebook. I glanced quickly at the page that was facingup. It was covered with notes, diagrams, and scribbles. I could see that thisman had been very busy. With a deep sigh, he began.“I have heard all this before,” he said, with his chin still resting on hishand. “I've been on the ‘path’ for over twenty years, with many teachers. In oneway or another, they have all said the same thing. What you are saying isnothing new. Still, you have touched on something that has never quite clickedfor me. How do our feelings inside have any effect on what happens in the worldoutside of our bodies?”I thought back to the discussion I had shared with my mother, months earlier.The idea that the nonphysical component of thought, feeling, or emotion couldhave any effect whatsoever upon the physical world of molecules, atoms, andcells was the mystery that my mother, as well as this gentleman, had asked me toaddress. I began with an explanation that I have used as an analogy many timesover the years. It comes from an experiment that I remember performing earlierin my life to prove to myself the principles that we were discussing.“The soup of creation exists as a state of possibilities,” I began. “All of thecomponents for all of the things that we could ever conceive of, including lifeitself, exist as this state of possibility. Although the components are there tobuild them, there has been no trigger to ‘nudge’ them into motion. The idea isvery similar to creating rock candy from a jar of water saturated with sugar. Wemay place many tablespoons of sugar into the water and watch as the sugardissolves and disappears. Though we no longer see the sugar, we know there areseveral tablespoons hidden somewhere in the water.“The sugar remains in the same state—invisible—until something comes along andchanges the conditions of the water. We call this a catalyst, something thattriggers a new opportunity for the sugar and water to interact. The trigger canbe as simple as placing a fibrous string into the water. As the sugar-ladenwater seeps into the string, it evaporates, leaving behind the sugar. In theabsence of the water, the sugar now crystallizes into a new expression ofitself, the shiny crystals that follow the laws of air rather than the laws ofwater. Different temperatures and pressures represent different laws and producedifferent crystals.“When we create feelings about the things that we choose to experience in ourworld, our feelings are like the string in the sugar solution. Into thepossibilities of creation, we place a feeling picture, just enough energy toallow for a new possibility. The key to this system, however, is that creationgives back precisely what our picture has shown. The picture tells the soup ofcreation where we have placed our attention. The emotion that we attach to ourpicture attracts the picture's possibility. When we ‘don't want’ something— anemotion based in fear—our fear actually fuels what we claim not to want. Theselaws invite us to empower our choices by focusing upon the positive experiencesthat we choose, rather than by preparing for the negative things that we don'twant. Creation simply allows us the consequence of our feeling, by perpetuatingwhat we have shown a picture of. This is the ancient secret of a lost mode ofprayer, forgotten in the fourth century A.D.”I saw the man's expression change before my eyes. In a matter of seconds, thissimple experiment, replicated today in mayonnaise jars bathed in the sunlight ofcountless windowsills in unnumbered classrooms throughout the world, explained apossibility that had mystified him for years."},{"pageContent":"HOW DO WE PRAY?Following our exercise of affirmations and prayer, I asked the audience membersif they felt that their prayers of the past had been answered. At first therewas a silence, a hesitancy to answer. Slowly, people began to raise their handsto say “no” or “only sometimes.” These people were telling me that for thecategories of prayer regarding money, jobs, relationships, and teachers, manyfelt that their prayers had not been answered.My next question was “Why?” Where do we turn to understand the sophisticatedtechnology of prayer, and how do we apply it in our lives? For purposes ofstudy, prayer researchers divide the many applications and methods of prayerused in the West into broad categories. For example, Margaret Paloma, asociology professor at the University of Akron, Ohio, identifies four classes,or modes, as described below:COLLOQUIAL PRAYERWe speak to God in our own words, informally describing problems or givingthanks for the blessings in our lives: “Dear God, please, this one time, if youallow my car to get to the gas station at the next exit of the freeway, Ipromise that I will never let the gas tank of my car get this low again.”PETITIONARY PRAYERIn this type, we claim our good from the creative forces of our world forspecific things or outcomes. Petitionary prayer may be formal or in our ownwords: “Mighty ‘I Am’ presence, I claim the right to heal.”RITUALISTIC PRAYERHere we repeat a predetermined sequence of words, perhaps on special occasionsor at prescribed times. Bedtime prayers such as “Now I lay me down to sleep” orthe “God is great, God is good” of mealtimes are familiar examples.MEDITATIVE PRAYERA meditative prayer is a prayer beyond words. In meditation we are silent,still, open, and aware of the presence of the creative forces within our worldand our bodies. In our stillness, we allow creation to express itself through usin the moment.To many people, the practice of meditation is beyond the scope of prayer. In thestrictest sense of the word, if the meditation involves a thought, a feeling,and an emotion, it may be defined as both meditation and prayer.The above four modes, used individually or combined with one another, constitutethe bulk of prayer modalities used in the West today.Throughout my experience of the indigenous and esoteric traditions, there havealways been references to a mode of prayer that has never seemed to fit into anyof these categories. Journeys into some of the most sacred places remaining onearth today have revealed a mode of prayer that is reserved for initiates andserious students of spiritual studies. The temple walls of Egypt, the customs ofNative Americans in the North and the curanderos (healers) in the mountains ofPeru have all demonstrated a form of prayer that does not appear to be accountedfor in Western traditions. Is it possible that a fifth mode exists which allowsus to merge our thoughts, feelings, and emotions into a single, potent force ofcreation? Furthermore, is this the force that opens directly to the healingprocesses of our bodies and our world? Ancient texts, as well as modern studies,suggest that the answer is yes.The examples of the healed cancer, the disappearing neck wound, compressed timein the Sinai desert, and the mysterious reversal of the intended bombings inIraq offer clues to the secret of our lost mode of prayer. Through our newunderstandings of time and choice points, quantum physics allows for thepossibility of each of these apparent miracles as outcomes that already exist.The secret of our lost mode of prayer is to shift our perspective of life byfeeling that the “miracle” has already happened and our prayers have beenanswered. Indigenous peoples of the world share this memory of prayer in theirmost sacred texts and oldest traditions. Now we have the opportunity to bringthis wisdom into our lives as prayers of gratitude for what already exists,rather than asking for our prayers to be answered."},{"pageContent":"DAVID'S PRAYERI reached over my shoulder and pulled a fresh bottle of water from my backpack.It was only eleven o'clock in the morning and already the high desert sun hadpenetrated the thick nylon, sapping any remaining coolness from the bottle. Forweeks now, the warnings had been issued: no campfires, no burning of refuse.Even tossing a cigarette from the window of a moving vehicle could subject aperson to a hefty fine. This was the third year of drought in the Americandesert Southwest. Though it was a time of weather extremes everywhere, it seemedas though the mountains of northern New Mexico were especially affected. Skiareas had not opened that year, and the Rio Grande slowed to a trickle beforemerging with the Red River near Questa.Opening the bottle, my grip on the soft, warm plastic forced a small trickle toerupt around the cap. I watched, fascinated, as the water splashed to theground. The surface was so parched that the droplets merged into a pool beforerolling into a small depression nearby. Even in that shallow pit, they did notspread and soak into the ground. To my amazement, the entire pool evaporatedwithin seconds.“The ground is too thirsty to drink,” David said softly from behind me.“Have you ever seen it this dry before?” I asked.“The old ones say that it has been over one hundred years since the rains haveleft us for so long,” David replied. “That is why we have come to this place, tocall to the rain.”I had met David years earlier, before I actually moved into the high desertnorth of Santa Fe. We had each been on a sacred journey away from our homes,families, and loved ones. His people called such a journey a “vision quest.” Forme, it was an opportunity to escape my corporate commitments and live close tothe land, a periodic evaluation of my purpose and direction in life. Five monthsafter our first meeting, I found myself living full-time in the mountains that Ihad previously visited for solitude. Though David and I seldom saw one another,when we did it was as if we had spoken only the day before. There was never anyawkwardness or need to apologize for our lack of correspondence. We each knewthat we had to place priorities on the events of our lives that demanded ourattention in the moment. In the present moment we were together, sharing a hotmorning in the summer desert.After a long, warm drink from my bottle, I stood up and began walking towardDavid. Already he was a good twenty steps ahead of me. I followed him along aninvisible path that only he could see. Our pace quickened as we made our waythrough thick stands of knee-high sage and chamiso bushes. I watched the groundin front of me. Each of his footsteps kicked up a small puff of dust thatdisappeared in the hot, dry breeze. Behind us there was not a trace of the trailthat we were creating. David knew exactly where he was going, to a special placethat had been known to his family and their ancestors for many generations. Yearafter year, they would come to this very place for their vision quests and ritesof passage, and on special occasions such as this day.“Over there,” David said. I looked where he was pointing. It looked remarkablysimilar to the other hundred thousand or so acres of sage, juniper, and pinethat surrounded us in the valley.“Over where?” I asked.“There, where the earth changes,” David replied.I looked closer, studying the land. Scanning the tops of the vegetation, my eyessearched for irregularities in spacing and color. Suddenly it leaped out at me,like a hidden image in one of those three-dimensional charts with a picturedisguised among the dots. I looked closer and saw that the tips of the sagebushes were spaced differently. Walking toward the apparent anomaly, I could seesomething on the ground, something large and unexpected. Stopping to positionmyself in the shade created by my body in the sun, I could make out a series ofstones, beautiful stones of all kinds, arranged in perfect geometries of linesand circles. Each stone was situated perfectly, betraying the precision withwhich ancient hands had placed it hundreds of years before.“What is this place?” I asked David. “Why is it here, in the middle of nowhere?”“This is the reason we have come,” he laughed. “It is because of what you call‘nowhere’ that we are here. Today there is only you, me, earth, sky, and ourCreator. That is all. There is nothing else here. Today we will touch the unseenforces of this world, speaking to Mother Earth, Father Sky, and the messengersof the in-between.“Today,” David said, “we pray rain.”I am always amazed at how quickly old memories can flood the present. I amequally amazed at how quickly they disappear. Immediately my mind raced to theimages of what I expected the next moments to look like. In my mind I recalledprayer scenes that were familiar to me. I remembered going to neighboringvillages and seeing native peoples dressed in garments of the earth. I rememberstudying them as they moved rhythmically to the beat of wooden mallets poundingon drums of elk hide stretched tightly over pine frames. Nothing in my memory,however, prepared me for what I was about to witness.“The stone circle is a medicine wheel,” David explained. “It has been here foras long as my people can remember. The wheel itself has no power. It serves as aplace of focus for the one invoking the prayer. You could think of it as a roadmap.”I must have had a puzzled look on my face. David anticipated my next thought,and answered before I had finished formulating the question in my mind.“A map between humans and the forces of this world,” he replied to the questionthat I had not yet asked. “The map was created here, in this place, because herethe skins between the worlds are very thin. From the time I was a young boy, Iwas taught the language of this map. Today I will travel an ancient path thatleads to other worlds. From those worlds, I will speak with the forces of thisearth, to do what we came here to do: to invite the rain.”I watched as David removed his shoes. Even the way that he untied the laces ofhis tattered work boots was a prayer—methodical, intentional, and sacred. Withhis feet bare to the earth, he turned his back and walked away from me towardthe circle. Without a sound he navigated his way around the wheel, taking greatcare to honor the placement of each stone. With reverence for his ancestors, heplaced his naked feet onto the parched earth. With each step, his toes camewithin fractions of an inch of the outer stones. Never once did he touch them.Each stone remained precisely where the hands of another had placed it, from ageneration long departed. As he rounded the farthest rim of the circle, Davidturned, allowing me to see his face. To my amazement, his eyes were closed. Theyhad been closed the entire time. One by one, he was honoring the placement ofeach round, white stone by feeling the position of his feet! As David returnedto the position closest to me, he stopped, straightened his posture, and movedhis hands into a praying position in front of his face. His breathing becamenearly indiscernible. He appeared oblivious to the heat of the midday sun. Aftera few brief moments in this position, he took a deep breath, relaxed hisposture, and turned to me.“Let's go, our work is finished here,” he said, looking directly at me.“Already?” I asked, a little surprised. It seemed as though we had just arrived.“I thought you were going to pray for rain.”David sat on the ground to put his shoes back on. Looking up, he smiled.“No, I said that I would ‘pray rain,'” he replied. “If I had prayed for rain, itcould never happen.”That afternoon the weather changed. The rain began suddenly, with a few splatson the deck facing the mountains to the east. Within moments the droplets grewlarger and more frequent, until a full-fledged thunderstorm was under way. Hugeblack clouds hovered over the valley, obscuring the Colorado mountains to thenorth for the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. The water accumulatedfaster than the earth could absorb it, and before long, local fears of floodingbecame a reality. I stared out at the eleven miles of sage between me and themountain range to the east. The valley looked like a vast lake.Later in evening, I watched the weather reports on the local stations. Thoughnot surprised, I remember feeling a sense of awe as the colored climate mapsflashed across the screen. Animated arrows indicated a typical pattern of cool,moist air angling down from the Pacific Northwest, across Utah, and intoColorado, as it often did for the summer months. Then, unexplainably, the jetstream changed its course and did something unusual. I watched, amazed, as theair mass dipped with precision into southern Colorado and northern New Mexicobefore looping tightly back to the north, resuming its path across the Midwest.With the dip came low pressure and cool air to mix with the warm, moist airmoving up from the Gulf of Mexico, the perfect recipe for rain. From thereports, it sounded as though there would be rain, and a lot of it. I calledDavid the following morning.“What a mess!” I exclaimed. “Roads are washed out. Homes and fields are floodedeverywhere. What has happened? How do you account for all of this rain?” Thevoice on the other end of the phone was silent for a few seconds.“That is the problem,” David said. “That is the part of the prayer that I havenot figured out yet!”By the following day, the ground was wet enough to accept more water. I drovethrough several small villages on my way into the nearest town. People wereecstatic with the coming of the rain. Children were playing in the mud. Farmerswere at the feed and hardware stores, resuming the business of livestock andagriculture. The crops had sustained minimal damage. Cattle had water inlivestock ponds, and it looked as though northern New Mexico would be spared theheartache of drought, at least for the remainder of one more summer."},{"pageContent":"GRATITUDE: BREATHING LIFE INTO OUR PRAYERSDavid's story beautifully illustrates the inner workings of the mode of prayerforgotten by our culture nearly two thousand years ago. Following his briefceremony inside the medicine wheel, David had looked at me and simply said,“Let's go, our work is finished here.” The remainder of my time with David thatday now makes much more sense and has much greater relevance.Now I knew what David's response, “I came to pray rain,” meant. The rest of thestory is perhaps best shared in David's own words.“When I was young,” he had said, “our elders passed on to me the secret ofprayer. The secret is that when we ask for something, we acknowledge what we donot have. Continuing to ask only gives power to what has never come to pass.“The path between man and the forces of this world begins in our hearts. It ishere that our feeling world is married to our thinking world. In my prayer, Ibegan with the feeling of gratitude for all that is and all that has come topass. I gave thanks for the desert wind, the heat, and the drought, for that isthe way of it, until now. It is not good. It is not bad. It has been ourmedicine.“Then I chose a new medicine. I began to have the feeling of what rain feelslike. I felt the feeling of rain upon my body. Standing in the stone circle, Iimagined that I was in the plaza of our village, barefoot in the rain. I feltthe feeling of wet earth oozing between my naked toes. I smelled the smell ofrain on the straw-and-mud walls of our village after the storms. I felt what itfeels like to walk through fields of corn growing up to my chest because therains have been so plentiful. The old ones remind us that this is how we chooseour path in this world. We must first have the feelings of what we wish toexperience. This is how we plant the seeds of a new way. From that pointforward,” David continued, “our prayer becomes a prayer of thanks.”“Thanks? Do you mean thanks for what we have created?”“No, not for what we may have created,” David replied. “Creation is alreadycomplete. Our prayer becomes a prayer of thanks for the opportunity to choosewhich creation we experience. Through our thanks, we honor all possibilities andbring the ones we choose into this world.”In his way, in the words of his people, David had shared with me the secret ofcommuning with the forces of our world and our bodies. Though I had heard withmy ears and understood what he had said, his words have even more meaning today."},{"pageContent":"OUR LOST MODE OF PRAYERFollowing my time with David, again I searched in the texts, some ancient, somecontemporary. I discovered that many groups, organizations, and philosophies hadhinted at our lost mode of prayer. Many continue to do so today, with techniquessuggesting that we “think like our prayers have come to pass” or “come from theplace that our prayer is accomplished.” As I have searched further into theirtechnologies, however, almost universally the element of feeling is absent.In the mid-twentieth century, the man known simply as Neville brought the lostmode of prayer to the forefront of contemporary thinking through his pioneeringwork in the laws of cause and effect. Born in Barbados, West Indies, Nevilleeloquently described his philosophy of bringing our dreams alive through the useof feeling by inviting us to “make [our] future dream a present fact by assumingthe feeling of [our] desire fulfilled.”4 [index_split_090.html#filepos514909]Additionally, Neville suggests that it is our love for our new state thatempowers its birth into existence. “Unless you, yourself, enter the image andthink from it, it is incapable of birth.”5 [index_split_090.html#filepos515123]Examining a specific prayer, such as a prayer of peace, may add a degree ofconcreteness to these sometimes nebulous concepts.Much of our conditioning in Western traditions has invited us to “ask” thatpeace come to pass in specific circumstances of our world. In asking for peaceto be present, for example, we may unknowingly be acknowledging the lack ofpeace in our world, perhaps inadvertently reinforcing what may be viewed as astate of nonpeace. From the perspective of our fifth mode of prayer, we areinvited to create peace in our world through the quality of thought, feeling,and emotion in our body. Once we have created the image of our desire in ourmind and felt the feeling of our desire fulfilled within our heart, it hasalready happened! Though the intent of our prayer may not have appeared in fullview of our immediate senses, we assume that it is so. The secret to the fifthmode of prayer lies in acknowledging that when we feel, the effect of ourfeelings has occurred somewhere, upon some level of our existence.Our prayer, then, originates from a very different perspective. Rather thanasking that the outcome of our prayer come to pass, we acknowledge our role asan active part of creation and give thanks for what we are certain that we havecreated. Whether we see immediate results or not, our thanks acknowledge thatsomewhere in creation our prayer has already been fulfilled. Now our prayerbecomes an affirmative prayer of thanks, fueling our creation, allowing it toblossom into its greatest potential. Following is a summary of our prayer ofpeace, through the traditional asking and from the perspective of our lost modeof prayer.[images/00017.jpg] [images/00018.jpg] Recent translations of original Aramaic texts offer new insights as to whyreferences to prayer may have been so ambiguous in the past. Twelfth-centurymanuscripts reveal the degree to which liberties were taken to condense sentencestructure and simplify their meaning. Perhaps one of the most obvious and, atthe same time, subtle of these references is a prayer that students of religiousstudies and in Sunday school classes have been taught for generations. Thisfragment of our lost mode of prayer invites us to “ask” that our heart's desirecome to pass and we shall “receive” the benefit of our prayer, as in thefamiliar admonition “Ask and you shall receive.” A comparison of the expandedAramaic text with the modern biblical version of the prayer offers powerfulinsights into the possibilities of this lost technology.The modern, condensed version:Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask and ye shall receive, that yourjoy may be full.6 [index_split_090.html#filepos515338]The original, retranslated Aramaic version:All things that you ask straightly, directly … from inside my name, you will begiven. So far you have not done this. Ask without hidden motive and besurrounded by your answer. Be enveloped by what you desire, that your gladnessbe full….7 [index_split_090.html#filepos515594]Through the words of another time, we are invited to embrace our lost mode ofprayer as a consciousness that we embody, rather than as a prescribed form ofaction that we perform on occasion. In inviting us to be “surrounded” by ouranswer and “enveloped” by what we desire, this ancient passage emphasizes thepower of our feelings. In the modern idiom, this eloquent phrase reminds us thatto create in our world we must first have the feelings of our creation alreadyfulfilled. Our prayers then become prayers of giving thanks for what we havecreated, rather than of asking that our creations come to pass."},{"pageContent":"A NEW FAITHI cannot say for certain that David's prayer played any role in the storms thatfollowed our time together. What I can say is that the weather in northern NewMexico changed that day. From weeks of drought, failing crops, and dehydratingcattle, in one day the weather shifted into torrential rains that gave way to apattern of daily showers lasting until the autumn frosts. Further, I can saythat there was a synchronicity between the unexpected shift in the weather andthe experience I had shared with David. The time between the events was a matterof hours. How are we to prove an event of such magnitude and significance?The people of the native villages in the desert Southwest need no proof; beyonddoubt, they know that within each of them lives the power to commune directlywith the creative forces of this world and beyond. They do so withoutexpectations, without judging the outcome of their communion. For example, ifthe rains had not come, David would have viewed the absence of rain as a part ofhis prayer, rather than as a sign of failure. His prayer was without condition.He placed no time frame on the outcome of his communion with the forces ofnature. David had shared a sacred moment with the powers of creation, plantedthe seed of a possibility through his prayer, and given thanks for hisopportunity to choose a new outcome. His unwavering faith that his prayer hadaccomplished something is the key to embracing our lost mode of prayer.In our modern world, we often find ourselves expecting quick gratification and arapid response. The processing time of our computers, for example, is more thanfifty times faster than when microcomputers were first introduced in the early1980s. We thought that they were fast then. Waiting for more than a fraction ofa second after typing our command into the keyboard often evokes anxiety from aresponse that was state-of-the-art only a few short years ago. Microwave ovenshave halved the time required to boil water with conventional electricity orgas. Now, we wait impatiently as the digital counter marks down the secondsuntil our water boils. There has been a tendency to view the results of prayerin much the same way. If results are not immediately forthcoming, we may feelthat our prayer has not worked. The ancients knew better.When David prayed rain, he knew beyond any doubt that his prayer had invited anew possibility to be present. He also knew that his prayer was a possibilityonly. Perhaps the effect was not immediately visible to our eyes. As he and Istood in the sage field, high in the deserts of northern New Mexico, the factthat we did not immediately see rain was of little consequence to David. He wasconfident in his ability to choose a new outcome, and his confidence camenaturally for him.David's certainty that he had planted a seed of possibility somewhere in theethers of creation, leads us to reexamine a word that may have lost meaning inrecent times. That word is faith. Though it is defined in The American HeritageCollege Dictionary as “belief that does not rest on logical proof or materialevidence,” the ancient and indigenous peoples of our world accept a much broaderdefinition of faith. Their understandings remain as valid today as ingenerations past, when faith was the key to communicating with the unseen forcesof our world. Through their wonderfully integrated view of our role in creation,faith becomes the acceptance of our power as a directive force in creation. Itis this unified perspective that allows us to move forward in life, trustingthat through our prayers we have planted the seeds of new possibilities. Ourfaith allows us to rest assured that our prayers are accomplished. In thisknowledge, our prayers become expressions of thanks, giving life to our choicesas they blossom in our world.> The paths of the Infinite Garden “must be traversed by the body, the heart and> the mind as one.…”> > > > —THE ESSENE GOSPEL OF PEACE> > [images/00006.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"[images/00019.jpg]THE SCIENCE OF MAN Secrets of Prayer and Healing In the fourth century A.D., our relationship to the forces of the world aroundus, as well as within us, began to change. When the words validating theserelationships were edited from the texts that had preserved them, we began toview ourselves as observers, passively witnessing the wonders of nature and thefunctions of our bodies. Traditions such as those of the Essenes and NativeAmericans suggest that our relationship to the world extends far beyond the roleof observer, reminding us that we are a part of all that we see. In a world ofsuch interconnectedness, it is impossible to watch passively as a leaf fallsfrom a tree or an ant races across the ground. The very act of observing, placesus in the role of participant.The physicist Niels Bohr offered a theory in the late 1920s that suggested thisvery relationship, and described a similar view in modern terms. It had beennoted that on the atomic level, matter sometimes behaved strangely, incontradiction to accepted theory. In simplified terms, Bohr's theory, known asthe Copenhagen View, postulated that the observer of any event becomes part ofthe event, just by the act of observing. In the very small world of atoms, theobservation takes on a greater significance as “atom-sized objects are disturbedby any attempt to observe them.”1 [index_split_091.html#filepos515924] From thisline of thinking it is clear that modern science is searching for a language todescribe the relationship of unity that the Essenes employed as the basis oftheir prayers.Viewing ourselves as independent of the world around us has precipitated a senseof separateness, an “in here” versus “out there” attitude. From the time of ourchildhood, we begin to believe that the world “just happens.” Sometimes goodthings occur, at other times things that are not so good. Our world appears tohappen all around us, often for no apparent reason. In preparing for the whatifsof life, we spend much of our time building strategies to survive and navigatewhatever challenges may come our way. New research into the relationship betweenthe power of our feelings and the chemistry of our bodies suggests that theimplications of such “us” and “them” viewpoints are far-reaching and, at times,unexpected.Science has demonstrated, for example, that specific feelings produce apredictable chemistry in our bodies that corresponds to that particular feeling.As we change our feelings, we change our chemistry. We literally have what maybe viewed as “hate chemistry,” “anger chemistry,” “love chemistry,” and so on.Biological expressions of emotion appear in our bodies as the levels ofhormones, antibodies, and enzymes present in our state of wellness. Lovechemistry, for example, affirms life by optimizing our immune system and theregulatory functions of our body. Conversely, anger, which is sometimes directedinward as guilt, may be expressed as a suppressed immune response.In the summer of 1995, Glen Rein, Ph.D., Mike Atkinson, and Rollin McCraty,M.A., published a paper in the Journal of Advancement in Medicine. Titled “ThePhysiological and Psychological Effects of Compassion and Anger,” it focusedupon the study of salivary immunoglobulin A(S-IgA), an antibody found in mucus,which defends our upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts frominfection. The essence of the paper stated that “higher levels of S-IgA areassociated with decreased incidence of disease to upper respiratoryinfections.”2 [index_split_091.html#filepos516152] The abstract of the paperconcluded that “anger produced a significant increase in total mood leveldisturbance and heart rate, but not S-IgA levels. Positive emotions, on theother hand, produced a significant increase in S-IgA levels. Examining theeffects of a six-hour period, we observed that anger, in contrast to care,produced a significant inhibition of S-IgA from one to five hours after theemotional experience”3 [index_split_091.html#filepos516473] (my emphasis).Further studies point to specific qualities of emotion as a powerful factor inhypertension, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease.Living as if the world “out there” were somehow separate from us opens the doorto a belief system of judgment and the chemical expressions of that judgment inour bodies. Thus we tend to see our world in terms of “good germs” and “badgerms,” and use words such as “toxins” and “waste” to describe the by-productsof the very functions that give us life. It is in such a world that our bodiesmay become a combat zone for forces at odds with one another, creating thebiological battlegrounds that play out as illness and disease.The holistic perspective of the Essenes, on the other hand, sees all facets ofour bodies as elements of one sacred and divine force moving through creation.Each is an expression of God. In a world where all that we may know andexperience originates from such a unified source, bacteria, germs, and theby-products of our bodies work together to imbue our bodies with strength andlife. This view invites us to redefine the tears, perspiration, blood, andproducts of digestion that we have known as “waste” as sacred elements of theearth that have served us, rather than abhorrent by-products that must beeliminated, discarded, and destroyed."},{"pageContent":"WHY PRAYER?The voice came from somewhere toward the back of the room. My eyes darted to theleft, searching each row to locate the source of the question. From the stage atthe end of the ballroom, I looked out over the participants in our three-dayprogram. I have always considered the opportunity to speak with an audience anhonor as well as a sign of trust. An important aspect of honoring each audienceis to acknowledge the questions that are certain to arise at the end of anymeaningful discussion. I gazed into the faces focused upon me. A glaring bank ofoverhead lights illuminated the first few rows from the ceiling. As I lookedtoward the back of the room, each successive row became more faint, merging intoa darkness that extended to walls I could not see. The only light visible acrossthe room was the green glow of the exit signs over the doors.“Who asked that question?”Directed by the gestures of the audience pointing to the left, I stepped off theplatform and walked to the aisle in the hope of eye contact. An audiencefacilitator with a microphone met me at the row where the fingers were pointing.“Here I am,” a frail voice echoed. “Good,” I said. “I see you now. What is yourname?” “Evelyn,” the tiny voice whispered awkwardly into the microphone. “Myname is Evelyn.”“Evelyn, would you please repeat your question?” I asked.“Certainly” she replied. “I simply asked, ‘Why prayer?’ What good does it do,really?”I heard the question that Evelyn was asking. I sensed an innocence underlyingher question as my mind listened to the words themselves. In the circles of myfriends and conversations, the role of prayer and prayer's relevance were commonthemes of our everyday discussions. Over long-distance conference calls andworldwide vigils coordinated on the Internet, we discussed the applications,origins, and techniques of prayer. Often our conversations were directed to thespecifics of global events unfolding in the moment. In my recollection of ourconversations, however, we had never discussed the actual purpose of prayer. Notreally. Evelyn was doing her work well. By asking her question, she was invitingme to draw an answer from deep within myself to a question that I had never beenasked.It was one of those moments that occur only rarely. Somehow her questionthreaded its way through the sentries of logic and reason, slipping into thereality of the moment. I had little idea of what I was about to say. In responseto Evelyn's question, I opened my mouth to reply, trusting implicitly in theprocess unfolding between us. One by one, the words tumbled from my mouth, inthe precise instant that each was formed. Though not particularly surprised, Iwas in awe of the process, how easily each word flowed, how concise my reply.“Prayer,” I began, “is, to us, as water is to the seed of a plant.”That was all! My response was complete. A silence fell over the room. Togetherthe audience and I paused to consider the power and simplicity of those thirteenwords. I thought about what I had said. The seed of a plant is whole andcomplete unto itself. Under the right conditions, a seed may exist for hundredsof years simply as a seed, a rigid shell protecting a greater possibility. Onlyin the presence of water will the seed realize the greatest expression of itslife.We are like those seeds. We come into this world whole and complete untoourselves, carrying the seed of something even greater. Our time with oneanother, in the presence of life's challenges, awakens within us the greatestpossibilities of love and compassion. It is in the presence of prayer that weblossom to fulfill our potential.A smile came over Evelyn's face. I sensed that she already knew the answer thatshe had masterfully drawn from me. It was as if she had known that the roomwould benefit from hearing the words that, apparently, I would not otherwisehave spoken that day. Early in the twentieth century, the prophet and poetKahlil Gibran stated that the work we do in our lives is our love made visible.In her courage to stand in a room of several hundred people, most of whom werestrangers to her, and speak timidly into her microphone, Evelyn drew from me aresponse that served each of us in that moment. Since that day, the sameresponse has served many people in many cities. In those moments, Evelyn and Idid our work—our love made visible—well together."},{"pageContent":"BEYOND THE WORDSI remember praying a lot as a child. I said my prayers in the way that I hadbeen taught, at mealtime, bedtime, during holidays, and on special occasions. Itwas during these moments of prayer that I would give thanks for the good thingsin my life and reverently ask God to change the conditions that hurt me, orcaused suffering in others. Often my prayers were for animals. I have alwaysfelt especially close to the animal kingdom, and took the liberty of sharing ourfamily home with the wildlife that I would find in the wooded areas near ourhouse in northern Missouri. Not allowed in the house proper, my animal friendswould often compete for space with the family station wagon in our single-cargarage. At any given time, nearly every class of animal was represented in thegarage-sanctuary, a part of our home that my mother came to call the“menagerie.”I remember feeling that our home was a refuge of sorts, a shelter until theinhabitants could fly, run, swim, or scamper back into their naturalenvironment. Sometimes the animals were sick or injured. With broken bones,shattered beaks, or torn limbs, I would find them in the wild, left alone tofend for themselves. Looking back, I now know that some of my guests were justtoo slow to escape my well-intentioned “rescue.”Living within customized habitats—individualized containers, glass jars, andconverted bathtubs—each animal had a label of its own, meticulously identifyingspecies, location found, and favorite foods. In an effort to explain why someanimals were abandoned by their own kind, friends and family gently reminded methat this was “nature's way.” I remember wondering, “What if nature's way coulduse a little help? What if all this animal needs is a few days in a safe homewith the right food to heal from its injury?” My reasoning was that following abrief time of healing, the animals could return to the wild for whatever lifeheld in store for them. Whether they lived one more day or for many years wasunimportant to me. What did matter was that the animal's suffering ended. Evenif the creature became a meal for another animal the next day, in the meantimeit would be strong, healthy, and free of pain.I would pray for my animals every night—for their safety, for their healing, fortheir lives. Sometimes my prayers would work. Sometimes they did not. I neverunderstood why. If God was everywhere, listening, why did he hesitate to answer?If he could hear all of my prayers and answer some of them, some of the time,why would he refuse to do the same for another animal at another time? Theinconsistency made little sense.I continued to pray as I got older. Though I believed that I was praying in moreadult ways, the themes of my prayers never really changed. I still spoke withthe “powers that be” on behalf of the animals in my life. For those running inthe wild as well as motionless casualties crumpled along the roadside, I askedfor the blessings of safe journeys and peace in their afterlives.Though I had always prayed for people as well, during this time my prayers forothers grew beyond the realm of familiar faces. In addition to family, friends,and loved ones, my prayers were often for people whom I had never met. I knewthem only as nameless faces that would flash across the screen of theblack-and-white television in our living room or stare back at me from the pagesof Look and Life. For animals and people alike, I prayed for their lives, and ahealing of the things that hurt them in this world.Eventually, my feelings about prayer began to change. Specifically, the feelingsthat I had while I was praying began to change. I sensed that something wasmissing. Though the sacredness of the moment was comforting to some degree, Ialways had the feeling that there was more. Often I would notice a naggingsensation deep inside myself, an ancient feeling that the prayer I had completedin the moment was just the beginning of something greater. I felt that there wasa time when we were closer to the unseen forces of our world, and to oneanother. In the absence of religion and ritual, I sensed that prayer itself wasthe key to our closeness. Somewhere in the mists of our ancient memory, I knewthat there must be more to the silent language that allows us to commune withthe forces of our world and beyond.In the early 1990s, I received the first inkling as to why my prayers had feltincomplete. The clue appeared unexpectedly one day as I was leafing through acopy of an ancient text given to me by a friend. What set this document apartfrom similar works was that the translator had returned to the original languageof the authors for his references, rather than reiterate the words of otherscholars, possibly distorted over time. There, in fresh translations of theoriginal Aramaic manuscripts, were the actual details of how to merge the threecomponents of prayer into a single, empowering force in our lives.The text that my friend had offered was compiled by a renowned scholar ofancient studies, Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, the grandson of Alexandre Szekely, whocompiled the first grammar of the Tibetan language over 150 years ago. Workingfrom the original Aramaic version of the Gospels, Szekely's translationsillustrated the rich language of the original prayers and stories offered byJesus and his disciples. Though not surprised, I am still in awe at the claritythat such translations continue to shed upon the teachings and science ofprayer. A fresh look at these works from the viewpoint of quantum physics offerssubtleties that have been lost in other translations throughout later times.Through the eyes of the Aramaic authors, for example, the way that a course ofevents unfolds in our lives is a matter of perspective. Whether we considerglobal history or personal healing, ancient scholars remind us that allpossibilities have already been created and are already present. Rather thanforcing solutions upon the events of our lives, we are invited to choose whichpossibility we identify with, and live as if it has already occurred. Clearly,this is not to suggest that our “will” is imposed upon others in the form ofprayer. Rather, it is our willingness to allow for all possibilities withoutjudging any of them, and knowing that we may attract or repel each through thechoices we make in our lives that provides the subtle difference. Choosing anoutcome through prayer does not guarantee that it will come to pass; our prayersimply opens the door to the possibility of that outcome. The question nowbecomes, How may we bring specific outcomes into the focus of the presentthrough prayer?"},{"pageContent":"WHEN THREE BECOME ONEThrough their writings we know that the ancient Essenes believed that we communewith our world through our perceptions and senses. Every thought, feeling,emotion, breath, nutrient, or movement, or combination of any of these, wasconsidered to be an expression of prayer. From the Essene perspective, as wesense, perceive, and express ourselves throughout our day, we are in constantprayer.Through the poetic grace and powerful metaphors of their time, Essene textsremind us that our body, heart (feelings), and mind work together in much thesame way as a chariot, horse, and driver.4 [index_split_091.html#filepos516594]Though considered independently, the three work hand in hand to provide ourexperience of life. In this analogy, the chariot is our body and the driver isour mind. The horse represents the feelings of our heart, the power that carriesthe horse and driver over the road of life. It is through the strength of ourphysical body, the wisdom of our heart's experience, and the purity of ourintentions that we determine our quality of life.If prayer is, in fact, the forgotten language through which we choose theoutcomes and possibilities of life, in a very real sense each moment may beconsidered as a prayer. In each moment of our waking and sleeping lives, we arecontinuously thinking, feeling, and emoting, contributing to the outcome of ourworld. The key is that sometimes our contributions are direct and intentional,while at other times we may be participating indirectly, without even knowing ofour contribution.Experience of the latter type may best be described by those who feel that life“just happens” to them. People having this experience often sense that they are“bystanders” simply observing the processes of life happening around them totheir friends, family, and loved ones—even to the earth itself. Feelings of thisexperience range from the awe and wonder of the birth of a new baby to a senseof helplessness at the tragic loss of life in times of war or natural disaster.Watching the horrors of refugees driven from their homes in the Kosovo crisis of1999, or the outrage of mass killings in a public school, are examples of suchmoments of feeling helpless.Recently translated texts, some of them over two thousand years old, offeranother way to participate actively, to “do something” during such experiencesof life. Recognizing the effectiveness of prayer's silent power, the ancientsdescribe a form of prayer known today as active prayer. As these components ofprayer are merged into one, we are offered a bridge into the language ofcreation. Through this bridge we may choose the outcome of a given situationfrom a series of possibilities. Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus,the Essene masters invited us to focus the power of prayer's individualelements—thought, feeling, and emotion, experienced as our heart, mind, andbody—into a single focused outcome. The key to such mastery is echoed in asingle passage: “The paths are seven through the Infinite Garden, and each mustbe traversed by the body, the heart and the mind as one….”5[index_split_091.html#filepos516863] It is this unified force of heaven'slanguage, spoken through our bodies, that imbues life into our prayers andassures us that “whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and bethou cast into the sea … that those things which he saith shall come to pass….”6[index_split_091.html#filepos516989]Consider the effects of prayer through a simple model. Over fifty years ago, in1947, Dr. Hans Jenny (pronounced “Yen-knee”) developed a new science to explorethe relationship between vibration and form.7[index_split_091.html#filepos517242] Through well-documented studies, Dr. Jennydemonstrated that vibration produced geometry. In other words, by creatingvibration in a material that we can see, the pattern of the vibration becomesvisible in that medium. When we change the vibration, we change the pattern.When we return to the original vibration, the original pattern reappears.Through experiments conducted in a variety of substances, Dr. Jenny produced anamazing variety of geometric patterns, ranging from very complex to very simple,in such materials as water, oil, and graphite and sulfur powder. Each patternwas simply the visible form of an invisible force.The significance of these tests is that Dr. Jenny proved, beyond any doubt, thatvibration causes a predictable pattern in the substance that it is projectedinto. Thought, feeling, and emotion are vibration. Just like the vibrations inDr. Jenny's experiments, the vibrations of thought, feeling, and emotion createa disturbance in the “stuff” that they are projected into. Rather than water,sulfur, and graphite, we project our vibrations into the refined substance ofconsciousness. Each has an effect.In chapter 4 we discussed the science that suggests that our future may alreadyexist as one of many “possibilities,” dormant in the soup of creation. As wemake new choices in our lives each day, we awaken new possibilities, andfine-tune the eventual outcome. This view implies that each time we ask forsomething in prayer, a possibility exists where our prayer is already answered.If this view of our world is correct, then in the garage menagerie of mychildhood, for example, each shattered beak, torn limb, and broken bone was onepossible outcome for that moment. In the same moment, another outcome existedwhere each animal in my care was already healed. Each outcome already existed.Each possibility was real.The key to choosing one outcome from among many possible outcomes is our abilityto feel as if our choice has already come to pass. From our previous definitionof prayer as “feeling,” then, stated another way, we are invited to find thequality of thought and emotion that produces such a feeling—living as if ourprayer had already been answered. For how may we benefit from the effect of ourthought and emotion, if each pattern is moving in a random direction? If, on theother hand, the patterns of our prayer are focused into union, how can the“stuff” of creation fail to respond to our prayer?When thought, feeling, and emotion are not aligned, each may be considered asout of phase with the others. While there may be brief areas of overlap, much ofthe pattern is unfocused, working in[images/00020.jpg] Fig. 1. Thought, feeling, and emotion as unaligned patterns. In the absence ofunion, they may lose their focus. different directions, independent of the rest of the pattern. The result is ascattering of energy.For example, if our thought is “I choose the perfect mate in my life,” a patternof energy is released that expresses that thought. Any feeling or emotion thatis not in sync with our thought is incapable of empowering our choice of aperfect mate. If they are misaligned through feelings that we are not worthy ofhaving such a perfect partner or emotions of fear, our patterns may actuallyhinder our choice from becoming our outcome. In this nonaligned state we mayfind ourselves asking why our affirmations and prayers have not worked.Through these simple examples, it becomes clear why prayer brings about thegreatest change when the elements of prayer are focused and aligned with oneanother.[images/00021.jpg] Fig. 2. Thought misaligned with feeling and emotion. This condition may renderour prayer scattered and ineffective. Without using the word prayer, and certainly in a less technical fashion, theidea of unifying thought, emotion, and feeling and living from the place of ourheart's desire was offered early in this century using a very differentlanguage. Further affirming the use of our fifth mode of prayer, of assumingthat our prayer has already happened, the work of Neville offers the following:“You must abandon yourself mentally to your wish fulfilled in your love for thatstate, and in so doing, live in the new state and no more from the old state.”8[index_split_091.html#filepos517472] Though effective, Neville's descriptions ofour ability to change outcomes and choose new possibilities in our lives mayhave made little sense to the people of the early twentieth century. As with somany thinkers whose ideas are ahead of their time, little was known aboutNeville's work until after his death in 1972.Understandings such as these allow us to view prayer as both a language and aphilosophy bridging the worlds of science and spirit. Just as other philosophiesare expressed through unique words and specialized vocabularies, prayer has avocabulary of its own in the silent language of feeling. Sometimes an idea thatmakes perfect[images/00022.jpg] Fig. 3. “… whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed… those thingswhich he saith shall come to pass.” (Mark 11:23). The key to effective prayer isthe union of thought, feeling, and emotion. sense to us in one language has very little meaning in another language that weare not familiar with. Still, the language exists.The philosophy of peace, for example, may be expressed through languages asdiverse as physics and politics, as well as prayer. For example, the greatestpeace in physics may be described as the absence of motion in a system. In sucha language, when frequency, velocity, and wavelength reach zero, the system isat rest and we have peace. In politics, peace may be interpreted as the end ofaggression or the absence of war. Our prayers may be thought of in much the sameway.Through the language of prayer, peace may actually be described as an equation,bringing prayer even closer to our science that many have dared to believe.Rather than the equations of numbers and variables, however, logic, feeling, andemotion become the components in our equation of prayer. Taking the form of astandard mathematical proof —if such-and-such is so, then we witness suchand-such an outcome—our equation of active prayer may be seen as follows:[images/00023.jpg] In the presence of this union, the forces of our inner technology may be focusedand applied to our outer world. As we align the components of prayer, we findourselves speaking the silent language of creation—the language that moves themountain, ends the wars, and dissolves the tumors.The beauty of prayer is that it is not necessary to know precisely how it worksto benefit from its miraculous effects. In this universal technology, we aresimply invited to experience, feel, and acknowledge what our feelings are sayingto us. Our prayers come to life as we focus upon the feeling of our heart'sdesire, rather than the thought of our knowing world."},{"pageContent":"THE FORGOTTEN KEYI knew that the answer existed somewhere in the texts that surrounded me.Somewhere among the books, papers, documents, and manuscripts scattered on thefloor around me were words that ancient masters had written over two thousandyears ago, with moments just like this in mind. They knew that in some futuregeneration the same questions would be asked that were posed to the masters inthe first millennium A.D. Though it would be a different world, the questionswould be the same, questions regarding our relationship to the cosmos, ourCreator, and one another. Specifically, they knew that those in their futurewould reach a point of development where the achievements of their day wouldcall to them, inviting them to remember the very foundation of human nature andreclaim the essence of their lives. I knew that clues into an ancient lineage ofwisdom were left for us today, for a moment precisely like this.It was two o'clock in the morning. I had been seated on the floor for hours,poring over the texts that surrounded me. I stood up and walked to one of thewindows overlooking thousands of acres of high desert sage. In the moonlesslandscape, I could barely make out the silhouette of the mountain to the north,rising over two thousand feet above the valley floor. Taking a deep breath, Iwalked back to the center of the five-sided building, the largest room on theproperty. Looking to the ceiling, once again I pondered the mystery of the beamsthat appeared from each wall, angled toward the sky that met at a point abovethe center of the room. Apart from these square beams made of pine, there wereno other signs of support holding the roof. I had always marveled at how eachbeam, eight inches square, was anchored into the earthen walls, twenty-fourinches thick, to hold up the ceiling. The structure provided a very sacredspace. It always felt as though I were in the womb of the earth when I foundmyself in the “dome,” as some people in the valley liked to call it. It wasperfect for evenings such as this one.Taking a deep breath, I sighed and reclaimed my space on the floor. I haddedicated several weeks to piecing together fragments of an understanding thatwould describe what I believed were the elements of a science lost to the Westnearly seventeen hundred years ago. Reaching for a document that I had seenhundreds of times before, once more I began to leaf through the pages. Suddenlymy eyes focused on a sequence of words that I had skimmed just fractions of asecond before. Something in that particular grouping, a pattern of words, caughtmy attention. I had probably seen the same words on many occasions. This time,however, they looked different and I found myself flipping through the book,scanning the text for words of familiarity. About three-quarters of the way downone page, I found them. The text that I was leafing through had converted theancient language of the Middle East into English. It was there that I saw theone key that I was searching for: the single word peace. “How, then, may webring peace to our brothers… for we would that all of the Sons of Men share inthe blessings of the angel of peace?”9 [index_split_091.html#filepos517687]The text in my hands echoed the question asked two thousand years ago, aquestion that is often heard repeated in public forums today. How are we to feedour hungry, house our homeless, heal our ill, and end our wars and suffering?Though relief aid, military solutions, and fragile treaties may address theoutward expressions of suffering on a physical level, and it remains importantto do so, the key to lasting change comes from shifting the thinking that allowsthese forms of suffering to continue. Perhaps in response to the same questionsthat modern seekers ask today, the visionaries and scribes of our past left ustheir understandings, explaining how to bring the power of prayer to bear uponthe challenges of society.Religious and spiritual practices in our time have asked us to weave the threadsof prayer into the fabric of our lives. Seldom, however, have we been shown how.At very best, the well-intentioned instruction offered today is vague, inexact,and nebulous.In texts carrying a lineage of wisdom that predates our history, we are shownthe fine points of this powerful technology lost long ago. After identifying theelements of thought, feeling, and emotion, the Essenes actually show us how tomerge the three components into a focused application! They do so by identifyinga common denominator that links the end of suffering with aligning the elementsof prayer. That thread may best be described by the masters of prayer in theirown words:> First shall the Son of Man seek peace within his own body; for his body is as> a mountain pond that reflects the sun when it is still and clear. When it is> full of mud and stones it reflects nothing.> > Then shall the Son of Man seek peace within his own thoughts.… There is no> greater power in heaven and earth than the thought of the Son of Man. Though> unseen by the eyes of the body, yet each thought has mighty strength, even> such strength can shake the heavens.> > Then shall the Son of Man seek peace with his own feelings. We call on the> Angel of love to enter our feelings, that they may be purified. And all that> was before impatience and discord will turn into harmony and peace.10> [index_split_091.html#filepos517863] These were the words! These were the clues that the Essenes had left for futuregenerations. Not only did they share with us the possibilities that prayer maybring into our lives, they opened the door to possibilities of prayer thatWestern science explains away as “miracles.” Knowing that we would reach a pointin our evolution where we would be asked to redefine the role of technology inour world, they left us the key to affirming life in the science and mystery oflife itself. Their secret is the ancient code of peace. Subtle and perhapsdeceptively simple, the power of our lost mode of prayer is found within theframework of peace!I turned the pages excitedly, looking for further confirmation, perhaps a hiddenclue describing the role that peace may play in the present day. Exceeding myexpectations, the words nearly jumped at me from the middle of the next page.“Seek the Angel of peace in all that lives, in all you do, in every word youspeak. For peace is the key to all knowledge, to all mystery, to all life.”11[index_split_091.html#filepos517993]In the tradition of their time, the Essene word for “angel” could be translateda number of ways, including “powers or forces that be.” With this in mind, thewords power or force may replace the word angel for those whose beliefs suggestthat angels are a religious or Christian term. Clearly, the technology offeredthrough the gift of prayer transcends any secular or religious orientation. TheEssenes appear to be describing a universal technology that, in some instances,dates to five hundred years before the time of Christ. Revealing itself in allaspects of their lives, even the moments of greeting and departing were viewedby the Essenes as an opportunity to affirm the power of peace within theirworld. The last words spoken by members of the brothers and sisters of theEssenes were “Peace be with you.”Now the pieces were in place. Through these words, in the language of theirtime, we are offered insight into a sophisticated technology, often overlookedin the West today. Beyond the microcircuits and computer chips of modernappliances, the technology of prayer is based in components that are sosophisticated we have yet to duplicate them in our machinery. The components arelogic and emotion, empowered through the operating system of peace!As I marked the pages for future reference, I found I was almost dizzy withexcitement. I had to share the results of my evening with someone. Glancing atthe small digital clock across the room, I blinked in disbelief. It was nearlyfour in the morning, certainly too early to call anyone. Reaching for my quiltedjacket, I stood up and walked toward the door. My wife was sleeping in our home,a rustic building several hundred feet from the office.Opening the door to step outside, I felt a rush of heat from the woodstovebehind me, escaping into the frosty air of the desert night. The thermometerbeside the building was hovering at nearly twenty degrees below zero, typicalfor this time of year. With the first rays of the high desert sun, morningtemperatures would quickly rise sixty degrees within an hour or two, creating abalmy afternoon in the mid-forties. Closing the door behind me, I walked acrossthe loose gravel that formed a walkway between the buildings. For just a moment,I stopped. It was a precious moment.With the exception of my breath, hanging in clouds of steam in front of my face,there was no sound. It was absolutely silent. There was no wind. The few leavesthat had not fallen from the Russian olive trees beside me were curled andbrown. The slightest motion of wind would have rustled them into the familiarsound of autumn. They were silent. I looked into the sky of a cloudless night,right through the edge of the Milky Way. I had seen it hundreds of times before.Tonight, everything seemed different. The ancients had shown us how to touchthose stars, and beyond, through our inner science of prayer. The reach of ourprayers, they reminded us, is mirrored in our beliefs concerning what we arecapable of. In that silent moment, it all made sense.I rushed up the flagstone walkway and across the deck, into the tiny house wheremy wife was sleeping. Excitedly, I sat on the edge of the bed and began to sharewith her my discoveries. She opened one eye to signal that she was hearing me,and I paused briefly. She smiled her warm, supportive smile. Quietly she asked,“Can we do this in the morning?”“Of course,” I said, a little embarrassed by my excitement.“Good,” she said. “This sounds important. I'd like to be awake to hear whatyou've found.”Though I was surprised at the intensity of my enthusiasm, I was not disappointedby my wife's response. Maybe it was time for me to sleep as well. After all,these texts had held their secrets for two thousand years. I knew that theycould wait a few more hours until sunrise."},{"pageContent":"KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM, AND PEACEI see a subtle distinction between the qualities of knowledge and wisdom.Knowledge may be viewed as the element of our experience that deals withinformation. All of the data, statistics, and behavior patterns of our past orpresent may be shared as knowledge. Wisdom, on the other hand, is how we liveour knowledge. Knowledge may be taught and passed down for generations as textsand traditions. The experience of wisdom must be lived by each individual ofeach generation to know the consequences of direct experience.There was a theme that ran through each piece of Essene knowledge that I hadfound the previous evening. The common denominator was the ancient key of peace.I viewed the poetry, analogies, and parables left in 2,500-year-old texts justas I would the code in an instructional book today. The Essene code of peace isbased in familiar qualities that we already experience in life: logic andemotion. In their way, the Essenes left us their knowledge of peace, remindingus of two things. First, we are shown the significance of peace throughout allof creation. Second, we are shown how applying peace to our inner world createschange in our outer world.The scholars of the Qumran communities have reminded us of the potential thatprayer may bring into our lives. Through their description of prayer'scomponents, we are given the equation for moving electrical energy across themembranes of our cell walls, generating complex patterns in the substance ofhuman consciousness, and creating specific chemistries within the laboratoriesof our bodies. In the presence of such power, is it possible that the image of“moving the mountain” is a literal description of the great power that lives asour greatest potential? In light of science's confirmation of prayer's effects,we must reconcile the possibility of such a power within our lives.Of all the distortion that has occurred in the translations of our most sacredtexts, the last key to our technology of prayer is one element that slippedthrough the fourth-century edits of the Nicean Council and remains with ustoday. Though the words may have been streamlined somewhat, enough of theoriginal intent remains to usher a new perspective into our lives. Elements ofthis key exist today in our biblical texts as well as in the Essene manuscriptspredating our Bible by several hundred years. Such “crossover” passages fuel thebelief that the two documents arose from a common origin.In some teachings, the lost code is known as the Great Commandment. The Book ofMark, chapter twelve, verse thirty solves the last mystery to merging theelements of prayer into focused union. To create this power, we are invited tolove in a very specific way. “Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart, withall thy soul, with all thy mind, with all thy strength.” Perhaps the key tounderstanding this mysterious passage is to be found in the Essene view of ourrelationship with our Creator. From their perspective, we are one with ourFather in heaven. “Beside the river stands the holy Tree of Life. There doth myFather dwell, and my home is in him. The Heavenly Father and I are One.”12[index_split_091.html#filepos518120] Within each person that walks this worldlives the divine spark of creation and of our Creator. This understanding, then,becomes the great challenge to our mystery. To focus our prayer, we must lovethe creative principle of life itself, our Creator, with all of our heart, soul,mind, and strength. Because we are one with our Father in heaven, in doing so,we have just loved ourselves. Through these four specifics, we are reminded howto honor the love that the Essenes referred to as “the source of all things.”The key is that it is only in the presence of this kind of love that the qualityof peace may be found to reward the labor of our prayer. The words have beenoffered before. Precisely what do they mean? What does it mean to love in thisway? How are we to love with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength?The lost code of the Essenes reminds us how this peace may be accomplished. Itis through our body, heart, and mind that we experience our thought, feelings,and emotions. While we may sense little control over our perceptions, it isthrough our link to our perceptions that we may choose the quality of ourexperience. The last portion of our code, based in logic and emotion, is perhapsthe final key in our quest to unify our prayers. “Know this peace with thy mind,desire this peace with thy heart, fulfill this peace with thy body.”13[index_split_091.html#filepos518298]Through the logic of our mind, we must know peace to be true. We must prove itto ourselves, demonstrating the viability of peace in our lives and in ourworld. Through the strength of our hearts, we must then desire this peace in allthat we experience. Peace already exists in our world. We are challenged to seekit out, to find peace even in places where it may look as if peace does notexist. It is through our bodies that we express our minds and our hearts. Wechoose the actions that we offer to the world. This passage reminds us to allowour actions to mirror outwardly the choices that we have already made within.In this way the Essenes challenged us to a code of conduct, of sorts. Thoughothers may choose actions in their lives that deny life in themselves or others,through these words we may hold ourselves to a higher standard. We are invitedto create peace in each of these elements, to achieve the love that brings unityto our actions."},{"pageContent":"SECRETS OF PRAYER AND HEALINGWe may look to pre-Christian traditions of the ancient Essenes for some of theleast distorted records of our forgotten technologies. Perhaps the greatestinsight into the eloquence of such wisdom may be found in the Essene model ofprayer and healing, which makes an assumption that begins where many moderntherapies conclude. The fundamental tenet of Essene healing is that we arealready healed. Within each moment of our time in this world we make choiceseither affirming or denying the life that already exists in our bodies.Essene masters viewed the expressions of illness as powerful illusions, stemmingfrom choices and actions made by the individual, rather than looking to external“causes.” They believed that we determine our response to the conditions of ourworld—sometimes consciously, other times not. Through their most sacredwritings, we know the Essene philosophy viewed the blueprint of our souls as adivine expression of our Creator, untouched and untainted by the experiences oflife. Our souls are already healed, and seek to express that state through ourbodies. Accepting our healing through our own beliefs and forgiveness, ourhealing is mirrored through our souls’ expression in this world, our bodies.This perspective invites us to view the conditions that we witness in our bodiesas indicators of the quality of our choices. If we could distill the manyproverbs, parables, teachings, and sayings into brief, concise summaries, wewould discover that this thinking suggests that we affirm or deny life in ourbodies through the quality of four assumptions or tenets. Each tenet contributesto our overall expression of health and vitality. Each testifies to theinterrelated nature of spirit, matter, and life. We may view these tenets today,through twentieth-century idiom, as possible models offering insight into thechoices that we make on a daily basis—their nature, our reasons for making them,and their possible outcomes.On the following pages, each tenet is stated concisely, in a few words or asingle sentence. An explanation follows, in the form of an example or a simpledescription. Then we examine the implications and consequences of the tenet,focusing on why it is important. Finally, we are shown how to apply a particulartenet in our lives today.TENET 1. WE ARE ALREADY HEALED.EXPLANATIONThe key to understanding this tenet is same one that allows us to choose newoutcomes for existing conditions. The understanding that we are already healedstems from our view of the world as an array of possible outcomes, and from ourability to choose which outcome we experience. Inherent in this faith is ouracknowledgment of our role as an empowered force in creation, bringing newoutcomes into focus while releasing those that have already served us. Our bodyis the feedback mechanism, mirroring to us the quality of our choices ofthought, feeling, emotion, breath, nutrients, and movement, and our honoring oflife.In the example of the disappearing tumor (chapter 4), rather than imposing thewill of healing upon the condition of the cancer, the practitioners chose tofeel, think, and emote from an outcome in which the tumor had never beenpresent. In doing so, they attracted the new outcome, the overlay of a quantumpossibility mirroring their beliefs of the moment. In two minutes and fortyseconds, the new belief replaced the old belief. The ancients knew the power ofsuch technology as a mode of prayer, transcending any religious, mystic, orscientific principles.IMPLICATIONSTo accept the tenet that we are already healed, we are invited to allow for thepossibility that there are many outcomes for a given condition. The act ofmaking new choices in our lives is the technology that allows us to select newpossibilities. From the viewpoint that defines prayer as a quality of feeling,prayer also becomes our language to fine-tune life-affirming choices of healthand relationship.The tenet that we are already healed reminds us that each time we ask to behealed in one outcome, a possibility exists where our prayer is already answeredin another. With this possibility in mind, each time we are diagnosed with acondition of ill health or lifethreatening disease, we are being shown only oneof many possible outcomes for that moment.The diagnosis of a condition is not necessarily either incorrect or correct. Inthe absence of allowing for other possibilities, it is simply incomplete. In thesame moment, another outcome must exist in which the ill health, disease, orcondition is not present. Each possibility already exists. Each outcome is real.Through the eyes of this tenet, the difference between outcomes is a matter ofour perspective.APPLIED TO OUR LIVESIn each moment, we make choices that affirm or deny life in our bodies.Consciously or unconsciously, we choose the quality of six parameters: thought,feeling, emotion, breath, nutrient, and movement. For each of the parameters, wemust ask whether we provide ourselves the highest quality of each that we arecapable of. In the event that we discover conditions within our bodies that wechoose to change, our quality of health is our signal to look at one or acombination of the six parameters of life.Applying our lost mode of prayer to the tenet that we are already healed, ourprayer becomes a clarification of the condition(s) that we choose to portray tothe world, rather than a plea for a change in our present condition. Feeling andliving from the knowledge that new conditions are present tunes us to theoutcome of our new choice.TENET 2. THERE IS ONLY ONE OF US HERE.EXPLANATIONGlobal census figures indicate that there are approximately 6 billion peopleliving on earth today. This tenet reminds us that each person is a unique,individualized expression of a single, unified awareness. Within this oneness,the choices and actions of each person affect all others to some degree.IMPLICATIONThe implications of this tenet are vast and, at the same time, tremendouslyrelevant. In its broadest sense, our role within a unified awareness means thatthere can be no isolated actions, no “them” and “us.” No longer can we view theconditions of our world as “their problems” and “our problems.” In a field ofunified consciousness, each choice that we make and every act we perform in eachmoment of each day must affect every other person in this world. Some actionsproduce a greater effect and some a lesser one. Still, the effect is there.Each time we choose a new way to deal with the challenges of life, our solutioncontributes to the diversity of human will that ensures our survival. As one ofus pioneers a new creative solution to the seemingly small challenges of ourindividual lives, we become a living bridge for the next person who findshimself or herself faced with the same challenge, and the next, and so on. Eachtime one of us faces the condition that others have faced in the past, we havemore options from our collective response to draw from. Relatively fewindividuals may create possibilities that become choices for the whole.Implied in such a world of unified awareness are the consequences of ouractions. Each time we hurt others through our words or actions, in effect wehave hurt ourselves. Each time we take the life of another, we have taken a partof our own lives. The very thoughts that allow us to hurt another limit ourability to express the will of creation through ourselves.At the same time, each time we love another, we have just loved ourselves. Eachtime we create time for another, strive to understand another, make ourselvesavailable for another, we have just done each of these things for ourselves.When we disapprove of the actions, choices, or beliefs of others, we witnessthrough them those portions of ourselves that ask for a greater healing.APPLICATIONAs others perform actions that we may judge negatively, we are invited toacknowledge their role in unity as the part of us that has chosen a differentway. Without condoning, consenting to, or even agreeing with the actions ofanother, we are compassionately invited to bless the action as a possibility andmove forward with our choice of a new way.The key to our oneness is the leverage to transform our world. The power of ouroneness allows for a relatively few individuals to affect the quality of lifefor an entire population.TENET 3. WE ARE IN RESONANCE, “TUNED” TO OUR WORLD.EXPLANATIONWe are a part of all that we perceive. As bundles of atoms, molecules, andcompounds, we are made of precisely the same elements that our world is made of,nothing less and nothing more. The foundation of many ancient and indigenousbeliefs, this tenet invites us to remember that through unseen threads andimmeasurable cords, we are part of every expression of life. In a world of suchresonance, every rock, tree, mountain, river, and ocean is a part of us.Whatever happens to the materials of our world is felt by our bodies.The materials that surround us in our daily lives mirror the quality of choicesthat we have made in our lives. Without exception, our homes, our automobiles,our pets, and our earth mirror to us, in each moment, the quality, implications,and consequences of our life choices.IMPLICATIONAs we learn to recognize what the conditions of our outer world are saying tous, we are shown empowering possibilities for creating change in our worldthrough changes in our lives. Researchers have documented shifts in the earth indirect relationship to the changes in human consciousness. From the extremes ofanger to the heights of compassion, sensors placed in the ground surrounding theindividual experiencing the emotions detect the change in biological frequency.What is the outward effect of many people, perhaps entire communities or cities,sharing common emotions of anger or compassion? Is it possible that the healingof emotions within the small world of our bodies has effects upon the worldaround us, on such things as weather patterns and earthquake activity?APPLICATIONIn each moment of life, we are in relationship to the elements of our world.Through our friendships, romances, homes, vehicles, and the circumstances oflife, we are offered powerful insights into our belief systems, judgments, andintentions. As we change our beliefs and find new ways to express ourselves,this tenet states that the world around us mirrors our choices. Turbulentsystems become peaceful in the presence of our peace. Life-affirming choiceswithin our bodies create conditions in our world that mirror our choices.Perhaps this is an explanation for the ancient suggestion that to heal ourworld, we begin by becoming the conditions of healing ourselves.TENET 4. THE TECHNOLOGY OF PRAYER ALLOWS DIRECT ACCESS TO OUR BODIES, ONEANOTHER, AND THE CREATIVE FORCES OF OUR WORLD.EXPLANATIONThrough our inner technology of prayer we commune with the unseen forces of ourworld. We have always had the ability to access and work through these forces todetermine the quality of our life and our world.IMPLICATIONThe experiences of our outer world mirror the choices that we have made in eachmoment, with each breath. Sometimes we are aware of our choices, sometimes not.Recent research has documented that our emotions and feelings directly influencethe expression of DNA in our bodies.14 [index_split_091.html#filepos518477]Additional studies now suggest that it is our DNA that influences the way atomsand molecules of our outer world behave as well!15[index_split_091.html#filepos518843]We have witnessed the response of human tissue to specific qualities of feeling,as in the “healing” of lesions and tumors within moments. The link has beendemonstrated, though the implications are beyond the framework of modernscience. Our choice to recognize the relationship is a deeply personal one,inviting us once again “to think the thoughts of angels and do as angels do.”16[index_split_091.html#filepos519150]APPLICATIONPrayer may be the single most powerful force in creation. Individually, we aregiven the silent language that allows us to participate in the outcome of eventsand the challenges of our lives. Together, mass prayer is our opportunity toshare in the outcome of our world.Ancient traditions and modern scientists suggest that prayer is thesophisticated technology that allows us to recognize the possibilities of futureoutcomes and choose which outcome we experience. As we become the veryconditions that we choose to experience in our world, we attract the outcomethat mirrors our choice. In doing so, wars, disease, and suffering no longersimply “happen”; rather, we are shown a mechanism for their occurrence. At thesame time, we are offered the power to choose again.How ironic it is that the findings of twentieth-century technology, largely theproduct of defense and military applications, have led to the insights directingus to the powerful yet simple science of prayer. The foundation is now in place.The data have been measured and the experiments have been run. We have proved,at least under certain conditions, that thought and emotion produce feeling, andthat feeling produces the vibratory patterns that affect our world. As we changethe quality of our feeling, we change the pattern of the vibration, thusshifting patterns of our outer world.The question now becomes how, and to what degree, do our patterns of feelingaffect the world around us? If we can find a link between the invisible force ofhuman feeling and the effect of our feelings on the world around us, then wehave come full circle. Such a link would give new credibility to ancienttraditions and the abilities of mystics and yogis reported over the years.Perhaps the work of Vladimir Poponin may offer some of the first evidence toconfirm a direct link between matter and human DNA."},{"pageContent":"MOVING MOUNTAINS: THE DNA PHANTOM EFFECTIn the early 1990s, Moscow's Russian Academy of Sciences reported a startlingrelationship between DNA and the qualities of light, measured as photons.17 In areport detailing these early studies, Dr. Vladimir Poponin described a series ofexperiments suggesting that human DNA directly affects the physical worldthrough a new and previously unknown field connecting the two. Recognized as aleading expert in the field of quantum biology, Dr. Poponin was on loan to anAmerican research institution when this series of experiments was carried out.The experiments began as the patterns of light in a vacuum were measured in acontrolled environment. After all of the air was removed from a speciallydesigned chamber, the patterns and spacing of the light particles followed arandom distribution, as expected. These patterns were double-checked anddouble-recorded, to be used as a reference for the next portion of theexperiment.The first surprise came as physical samples of DNA were placed inside thechamber. In the presence of genetic material, the spacing and patterns of thelight particles shifted. Rather than the scattered pattern that the researchershad seen before, the particles of light began to fall into a new patternresembling the crests and troughs of a smooth wave. The DNA was clearlyinfluencing the photons, as if shaping them into the regularity of a wavepattern through an invisible force.The next surprise came to the researchers as they removed the DNA from thechamber. Fully believing that the particles of light would return to theiroriginal state of random distribution, something very unexpected occurred. Thepatterns were very different from those seen before the DNA was introduced. Inhis own words, Poponin described the light as behaving “surprisingly andcounterintuitively. ” After rechecking the instruments and rerunning theexperiments, the researchers were faced with finding an explanation for whatthey had witnessed. In the absence of the DNA, what was affecting the particlesof light? Did the DNA leave something behind, a residual force of some kind,that lingered long after the biological material had disappeared?Poponin writes that he and the researchers were “forced to accept the workinghypothesis that some new field structure is being excited….” To emphasize thatthe effect was related to the physical DNA molecule, the new phenomenon wasnamed the “DNA phantom effect.” Poponin's “new field structure” soundssurprisingly similar to the “matrix” of Max Planck's force and the effectssuggested in ancient traditions.This series of experiments is important because it clearly demonstrates, perhapsfor the first time under laboratory conditions, a relationship that offers evengreater credibility to the effect of prayer in our physical world. In thisinstance the DNA was more or less a passive collection of molecules unattachedto the brain of a conscious living being. Even in the absence of direct feelingpulsing through its double-helix antenna, there was a force and a measurableeffect in its immediate world.Researchers suggest that the average-sized person, of average height and weight,has many trillions of cells in his or her body. If each cell, each antenna offeeling and emotion within an individual, carries the same properties affectingthe world around them, how much is the effect amplified? Now, rather than randomfeelings coursing through the cells of that one person, what happens if thefeeling is a result of a specific form of thought and emotion, regulated asprayer? Multiply the effects of this one individual, empowered through aspecific mode of prayer, by even a fraction of the 6 billion or so people in ourworld today, and we begin to get a sense of the power inherent in our collectivewill. It is the power to end all suffering and avert the pain that has been thehallmark of the twentieth century. The key is that we must work together toachieve such a goal. This may prove to be the greatest challenge of the thirdmillennium.In our own language we have the vocabulary to describe our forgottenrelationship to the forces of our world, the intelligence of the cosmos, and oneanother. Using some of the most sensitive devices of our time to measure fieldsof energy that we did not even acknowledge fifty years ago, our own science hasnow validated the relationship of which the ancients reminded us over twothousand years ago. We have direct access to the forces of our world, and wehave come full circle. This is the language to move mountains. It is the samelanguage that allows us to choose life over cancerous tumors, and create peacein situations where we may believe that peace does not exist. When we read ofhealing miracles in times past, no longer are we left wishing that the samemiracles could occur today. The miraculous outcomes are already here; we aresimply asked to choose them.Today I continue to pray. For me, each moment of life has become a prayer. Istill give thanks for the good things and now feel empowered to choose newconditions in place of those that have caused suffering in the past. My trainingin the hard sciences has shown me that there are few mysteries and little wecannot validate, if we dare to accept the “laws” that nature shows us in themiracle of each day.Prayer has demonstrated to me that certain things are, regardless of our abilityto prove them in the moment. For example, I know that some of the most sacredmemories of our heritage have been scattered throughout the monasteries,churches, tombs, and temples of those who have come before us. I also know thatthe same memories live on in the customs and traditions of peoples that we maypreviously have judged as primitive. I know that we are capable of beautifuldreams, great possibilities, and unspoken depths of love. Perhaps mostimportant, I know that a possibility already exists in which we have ended thesuffering of all creatures by honoring the sacredness of all life. Thatpossibility is already here and with us now. I know these things to be true,because I have seen them. The moment we allow for such possibilities on a massscale becomes the first moment of new hope. It is that moment that we willalways remember. It is the moment when we override the last day of prophecy.> Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war> any more: For the former things are passed away.> > > > —THE ESSENE BOOK OF REVELATION> > [images/00006.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"[images/00024.jpg]HEALING HEARTS, HEALING NATIONS Rewriting Our Futurein the Days of Prophecy Only moments earlier, I had been alone. Walking along the old road thatparalleled the valley to the west, I threaded my way through chest-high standsof mountain sage, still wet from the morning frost. The ground was soft and drybeneath a thin layer of ice that crunched under my feet. With each step, my feetsank into the fragile mixture of clay and soil, leaving a perfect impression ofmy lug-soled work boots in the desert floor behind me. Searching in the glow ofpredawn, I could see someone walking toward me. As I squinted to adjust my eyes,I knew that it was Joseph. We had agreed to meet, as we often did, simply towalk, talk, and share the morning. The first rays of the winter sun cast longshadows from behind the Sangre de Cristo Mountains towering to the east.Together we stood with our backs to the rocks and gazed at the magnificent vistabefore us.Standing on the rim of a valley containing over 130,000 acres of an especiallyfragrant sage, Joseph stopped and inhaled a deep breath.“This entire field,” he began, “as far as our eyes can see, functions as asingle plant.” His words formed brief clouds of steam as his breath merged withthe chill of air still cold from the night.“There are many bushes in this valley,” he continued, “and every plant is joinedto the others through a root system that is beyond our view. Though they arehidden from our eyes, beneath the ground, the roots still exist. The entirefield is one family of sage. As with any family,” he explained, “the experienceof one member is shared to some degree by all others.”I listened to what Joseph was saying. What a beautiful metaphor, I thought, ofthe way that people are connected to one another through life. Though we seemany bodies that we believe are strangers, living independent lives of unrelatedtasks, there is a single thread of awareness that binds us as a family. Ourconnection is through a system that we do not see. Still, the connection existsas what some have called a “universal mind”: the mystery of our consciousness.Like the sage plants, we are all related during our journey through this world.In consciousness, there is only one of us here.Sometimes the great mysteries of life become clear only when we stop thinkingabout them. Though we may know information in our minds, the meaning of amystery must be felt before it can be lived. In the innocence of the moment,sharing the experience of another sometimes becomes the catalyst to awaken newunderstandings within ourselves. Now I know why.I often think back to that morning, awed by the eloquent simplicity with whichJoseph described the relationship of the sage plants. In addition tounderstanding how we are connected, Joseph's explanation also described thepossibilities of such a relationship. For example, when one area of sagedevelops a tolerance to an insect or a particular chemical, the entire familydemonstrates the same tolerances. The key is that many benefit from theexperiences of just a few. Recent studies into the effect of mass prayer—manypeople's feeling focused on a common theme—document similar relationships inhuman consciousness. The quality of life for an entire neighborhood has beenshown to be affected by the focused prayer of a few individuals.Almost universally, ancient traditions believe that the relationship runs evendeeper between the world of every day and the inner world of our consciousness.Viewing our bodies and the earth as mirrors of one another, they suggest thatthe extremes witnessed in one may be considered as metaphors for changes withinthe other. This thinking relates destructive weather patterns and storms, forexample, to the unsettled consciousness of people where the storms occur. At thesame time, such holistic views suggest that the extremes of earthquakes,life-threatening storms, and disease may be eased, or even eradicated throughsubtle shifts in our belief systems.If in fact these relationships exist, then perhaps for the first time we maylook to the twenty-first century with a new sense of confidence and trust.Beyond long-standing prophecies of a third world war, beyond predictions ofcatastrophic loss of life and end-of-century chaos, the 2,500-year-old secret ofprayer may provide a rare opportunity to define our time in a way that we haveonly seen in dreams. Rather than protecting ourselves from events that mayappear to have power over us, we may actually choose the life-affirmingconditions that transcend illness, suffering, and war in our future."},{"pageContent":"SOFT TEMPLESIn the words of their time, Gnostic scholars appealed to future generations toremember that the earth is in us, that we are in her, and that the two of us areintimately enmeshed in all that we experience. New translations of Essenedocuments from the Dead Sea caves illustrate even greater, and sometimesunexpected depths, of their authors’ understanding. The motivation for theceremonies, rituals, and lifestyle of early Essene communities was their deepconviction honoring the living thread that binds all life, throughout allworlds.Essene masters viewed our body as a convergence point through which the forcesof creation join to express the will of God. They considered our time togetheras an opportunity to share the very experiences of anger, rage, jealousy, andhatred that we sometimes shun and judge in our lives. It is through the samebodies that we hone the qualities of love, compassion, and forgiveness thatelevate us to the greatest expressions of our humanness. For this reason, theyregarded our body as a sacred place, a soft and vulnerable temple for our soul.It is within our body-temple that the forces of the cosmos unite as anexpression of time, space, spirit, and matter. More precisely, it is within theexperience of time and space that spirit works through matter to find thefullest expressions honoring life. Interestingly, the Qumran scholars focusedupon a particular place within the body, rather than on the body itself as thelandscape of divine expression. In the words of a fragment found in the Dead SeaScrolls, we are reminded that through our bodies we have “inherited a holy land… this land is not a field to be plowed, but a place within us where we maybuild our holy temple.”1 [index_split_092.html#filepos519454]Within the innermost recesses of ancient temples are found the most sacredportions of the sanctuary. In the temples of Egypt, for example, the holiestchapel is nestled deep in the interior of the complex. Timeworn scriptures referto the single room, often small in comparison to the rest of the structure,embedded within winding corridors and preparatory shrines as the beth elohim,the holy of holies. It is in the holy of holies that the invisible world ofspirit touches the physical matter of our world.Carrying this metaphor from the hard temples of stone to the soft temples oflife, our bodies must have a holy of holies as well. Perhaps in a manner yet tobe recognized by the science of today, the innermost portion of our livingtemples represents the sacred place where the body of matter is touched by thebreath of spirit. Does such a place exist within us?In a report from the third annual conference of the International Society forthe Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine, scientists documented thenonphysical force of emotion actually changing the physical molecule of DNA.Based in rigorous testing of individuals capable of emotional self-management,as well as control subjects without any specialized training, the study reportedthat “individuals trained in generating focused feelings of deep love…were ableto intentionally cause a change in the conformation [shape] of the DNA” (myemphasis).2 [index_split_092.html#filepos519712] Specific qualities of emotion,produced at will, determined to what degree and how tightly the two strands ofthe molecule of life were coiled!This study is important for a number of reasons. The way that our basic buildingblock of life is configured plays a key role in the way DNA repairs andreproduces itself in our bodies. The question has remained as to what determinesthe actual shape of the DNA molecule. Confirming the long-held suspicion thatemotion greatly affects our health and quality of life, these reports nowdemonstrate, perhaps for the first time, that emotion is the missing link, adirect line of communication to the very core of life itself.Could the Dead Sea Scroll references to a “holy land…a place within us where wemay build our holy temple” be a description of the actual cells of our bodies?After all, this is the place where science has now witnessed the marriagebetween spirit and matter. If this is the case, then each cell within the templeof our bodies is, by definition, a holy of holies. Each cell must be consideredsacred! The moment that our technology allowed us to witness spirit shaping theworld of matter (emotion shaping DNA), we opened the door to a new eraacknowledging the relationship between our beliefs and our experience.The understandings gleaned from something as unlikely as 2,300-year-old texts,now validated by twentieth-century science, may be considered a kind of“biological unified theory.” Such a theory offers a long-sought mechanism todescribe our relationship to all life. Beyond science, religion, and mystictraditions, we have no name for our revised worldview as yet. Echoing theindigenous traditions of ages past, views of this kind are reminiscent of thewords that our abbot left with us in Tibet. “We are all connected,” he had said.“We are all expressions of one life…. We are all the same one.”Perhaps the similarity of his words to those of Joseph describing the sage, andto the Essene texts, is no coincidence. Records indicate that a particular sectof the Essenes, the Carmelites of Mount Carmel, transported copies of their mostsacred writings into remote regions of the world to preserve them from thecorruption that was befalling such texts following the time of Jesus. NativeAmerican elders describe tribal memories of emissaries bringing Essenetraditions to North America nearly two thousand years ago.Additional texts found their way into secluded monasteries of central Asiaduring the same period. One of these documents, known to historians as theAramaic Gospel of Matthew, is also known as the Gospel of the Nazirenes, theGospel of the Hebrews, and the Gospel of the Ebionites. All of these names referto the same manuscript. This particular text is clearly documented as havingfound its way into isolated monasteries of Tibet during the first century A.D.,and has been established as “considerably older” than the finished version ofthe New Testament.3 [index_split_092.html#filepos520087]"},{"pageContent":"GATEWAY BEYOND THE WORLDSAn irony often appears with the development of an advanced technology.Generally, the simpler the technology appears to the user, the more complex thesystems are behind the scenes to allow such simplicity. A beautiful example ofthis concept may be found in our picture-driven computers and “point and click”technology. Each time we move our computer cursor across the screen and click onthe picture of a program that we choose, we have set into motion an amazinglycomplex series of operations. Internal pointers, machine language, shells ofoperating systems, and application programs are brought to life at the speed ofelectrons racing along pathways of microcircuits. All we did was point to apicture and push a button. Fortunately, we are not required to know any of theevents occurring behind the scenes. In fact, it may be a relief not to know.Our inner technology of accessing creation operates in much the same way. As wemaster certain experiences in our lives, it is those very experiences that openthe doors to other worlds and possibilities that we may only have dreamed of inthe past. Perhaps without even realizing the power of their writings, ancientscholars remind us that from the moment of our birth we are conduits of theeasyto-use, yet highly sophisticated, technology to transform our world. Theteachings of the Ebionite and Nazirene communities hint at the lost language andforgotten power living within each of us. It is this silent language that allowsus to become gateways, bringing the qualities of heaven to earth. The wisdom,peace, and compassion that we experience in our dreams, for example, may becomethe reality of our world by reflecting such qualities in our daily lives.Through an excerpt from an Essene text, we are reminded of the possibilities ofsuch a relationship: “… who doth build on earth the kingdom of heaven … shalldwell in both worlds.”4 [index_split_092.html#filepos520410] Our lost languageof prayer is the bridge linking the worlds of heaven and earth. “Only throughthe communions … will we learn to see the unseen, to hear that which cannot beheard, and to speak the unspoken word.”5 [index_split_092.html#filepos520585]As deceptively simple as our most advanced computer technology, the implicationsof these pre-Christian concepts touch our lives in ways that we may neversuspect. They imply that we each participate in the outcome of global events aswell as the health of our bodies and the quality of our relationships. Sometimeswe are aware of our participation, and sometimes not. In light of theseunderstandings, centuries-old references suggesting that our lifetime is a rarewindow of opportunity now take on new meaning and perhaps greater significance.It is during our time, through managing our choices, that we are invited tocreate an outer world that mirrors our innermost prayers and dreams."},{"pageContent":"MIRACLE IN THE ANDESIn the spring of 1998, the weather phenomenon known as El Niño was wreakinghavoc throughout the world, in the form of extremes of temperature, rainfall,and winds. In the mountains along the west coast of South America, Peru wasexperiencing the brunt of storm systems moving onto the mainland from thePacific Ocean. After massive rains of record proportions, the flooded lowlandsran together, forming a new lake covering 2,300 square miles. Rich farmlandsthat had been handed down in families for generations had changed into apermanent freshwater landform so large that the new lake is now visible onsatellite photographs.6 [index_split_092.html#filepos520760]In other parts of Peru, however, El Niño created the reverse effects, withbelow-average rainfall and a drying of the dense jungle growth created fromrains earlier in the year. The mountain highlands in the southern portion of thecountry became particularly susceptible to a rare period of extreme dryness andthe danger of inaccessible forest fires. Located at an altitude nearly two milesabove sea level, the ancient temple complex of Macchu Picchu, portions of whichare now believed to have been built before the time of the Incas, is situated inthe midst of some of the most luxuriant forest in the country. One of the mostpopular and mysterious archaeological sites remaining on earth today, themassive temple complex draws thousands of tourists each year and is a nationaltreasure. The absence of rain, combined with the already low humidity of suchelevations, created the conditions for fires that could become a disaster ofcatastrophic proportions.I was guiding a prayer trek through the mountains outside of Cuzco in May of1998, when our Peruvian guide and translator shared a story that touched eachmember of our group deeply. At the same time, her story confirmed our belief inthe focus of our journey: to explore and embrace the lost science of prayer.Maria stood at the front of our tour bus as we wound our way through the narrowroads to the ancient site of Pissiac, with a temple complex situated over twomiles above sea level. The next morning we would begin a four day trek throughthe Andes to our destination at the “lost city” of Macchu Picchu. In addition tothe physical challenge of the trek, the purpose of our journey was to createexperiences that would draw from us the strength, wisdom, and compassion to movethrough our lives with grace.During each morning of our journey, we would begin our day with a meditativetheme that would take on deeper and greater meaning as we faced the challengesof each day. These moments would become experiences to be carried back into theworld of our families, careers, and the circles of those whom we love and holdmost dear. For example, the strength required each night to carry our bodiesinto our campsite, located on a shelf at 14,000 feet, would become a model forthe same strength that allows us to move forward in the face of life's greatestchallenges. Each day of the journey became a reference point for one quality ofprayer that held the potential of serving us in the presence of life's greatestchallenges.When lightning had ignited fires in the high Andean jungles earlier in the year,the local communities had organized to battle the blazes and save theirvillages. Despite their efforts, the fires had burned out of control, spreadingfor days as government officials and local people looked on, helpless andexhausted. The fires cut a widespread path of destruction, appearing to beburning in all directions at once. One afternoon the winds shifted and the fireheaded directly toward the temples of Macchu Picchu. Mobilizing the fewresources available, firefighters mounted an effort to smother the flames beforethey reached this most famous example of Andean history. With little equipment,railroads washed out, and trails blocked with mudslides from earlier rains, theonly source of water was the narrow Urubamba River, in a canyon several thousandfeet below. Efforts to rescue the temples were fruitless. The front line of thefire advanced, razing the peripheral sites of the multi-acre complex. As theflames scorched the outlying temples on the peak of nearby Wyannu Picchu, thesituation looked hopeless.Exhausting all other means of stopping the inferno, local villagers resorted toa technology that had been a part of their culture for centuries. In groups offamilies and as individuals, publicly and privately, they began to pray. Thoughthe specific prayers varied, the underlying theme was consistent: they prayed tospare the temples of Macchu Picchu. Collectively they were directing theirprayers to a common challenge. Within hours the people of Southern Peruwitnessed an event that many consider to be a miracle. A lowpressure systemdeveloped over their portion of the Andes. A mass of moist, warm air from thecoast merged with the cold, dry air of the mountains, the skies clouded, and itbegan to rain.The rain became a downpour, soaking the dense forest where the fire had jumpedfrom treetop to treetop. Rainwater poured down through gullies cut from the baremountaintops, into the parched earth below. Mixing with the rich soil to createa thick black mud, the slurry steamed as it poured over heated rocks into thefire zone. Within hours the flames had disappeared, leaving smoldering treetrunks in the wake of the worst fire in the recorded history of the area.Outsiders looking on had witnessed what they believed was a fortunatecoincidence. Government officials were mystified. Local villagers were simplyrelieved. To them there was no mystery. God had heard their prayers, andanswered.Similar stories have been shared regarding mass prayers accelerating the peaceprocess in Northern Ireland, avoiding the loss of life from NATO bombing raidsin Iraq, and the mysterious course change of an asteroid on a path to collidewith earth in 1996. In each instance, circumstances that were certain to resultin a tragic outcome, with the equally certain loss of human life, shiftedunexpectedly. In each instance the shift was coincident with the effort of manyindividuals and groups coordinated in mass prayer. Western science has nowvalidated that, at least to a degree, our outer world of atoms and elementsmirrors our inner world of thought and emotion. Could creating peace andcooperation in our world be as simple as joining in unified prayers of the same?For hundreds of generations the framework of prayer as a support system in timesof joy as well as crisis has played a central role in the lives of individuals,families, and communities. Crossing the boundaries of culture, age, religion,and geography, the silent language of prayer is perhaps the most universalcustom that we share as a species. It is almost as if somewhere, hidden in themists of our collective history, we have a memory of this sacred language thatspeaks to the unseen forces of our world and one another.Perhaps it is our deep and very personal views of prayer that has allowed ouruniversal custom to become a source of our separateness as well. Even today, aswe step into the first days of the third millennium, emotions run high asscience and philosophy debate the power of prayer. To the ancients, to theindigenous people of our world, and in many Western households today, nophysical proof of the power of prayer is required. Those who pray have witnessedthe outcome of their prayers for generations in the absence of validation,measurement, or what many today may call scientific proof. To people of faith,the miracles in their lives are all the proof they need.For others of our time, however, it is the ability to measure, document, andvalidate the wonders of life that have allowed them to build the technology thathas brought us safely to this moment in our lives. Each path is valid. Bothinvite us to make the choices that define our future."},{"pageContent":"WHAT WOULD IT TAKE?Masses of people have always fascinated me. Gazing into hundreds of faces fromthe solitude of an airport café or a bench on the edge of a bustling citysquare, many times I have wondered what it would take to bring each person,independently carrying out seemingly unrelated tasks, together in a commonmoment of peace and cooperation. What event could possibly reach beyond thedifferences of appearance, past the concerns of daily routines, to awaken thememory of a common history, leading into a shared future in the only world thatwe know?One school of thought suggests that as people and nations we have grown soseparate from our earth and from one another that only a crisis of immenseproportions will awaken our memories of oneness and renew the possibility ofcooperation. Strangely, it appears that times of adversity draw from us ourdeepest knowledge, expressed as our greatest strengths, to triumph over ourshared ordeals. During such times, a common goal takes precedence over anydifferences of ethnic origin, social class, and culture.History demonstrates that diverse populations tend to pull together in times ofcrisis. During the Kobe earthquake in Japan, for example, the great fires inMexico, or the unprecedented hurricane season of 1998, people of all walks oflife abandoned their social status to offer assistance in places where it wasmost needed. Suddenly, corporate executives were standing beside street vendorsin the remains of collapsed buildings to free children trapped in the rubble.Bank presidents were working with the national guard to shore up flooded levees.During one of the worst ice storms in recorded history, 5.2 million peoplesurvived without power for thirty-three days in the winter of 1998. In portionsof Canada and the northeastern United States, communities where people hadbarely known one another only days before shared emergency kerosene heaters andcookstoves.It may be that a similar scenario, perhaps on a global scale, will be theimpetus to merge our inner technology of prayer, quantum thought, and the powerof human emotion. The threat of a rogue asteroid hurtling toward earth, forinstance, or a disease that cannot be stopped with conventional medicine, mightbe a catalyst for such cooperation. Fortunately, these examples arehypothetical, at least for now. Not so hypothetical, however, is a growingthreat to the fragile peace that has graced our world since the end of the lastworld war, over fifty years ago."},{"pageContent":"NATION AGAINST NATIONAt the birth of the twenty-first century, the conditions appear to be in placefor a great polarization of world powers, bringing the threat of a global warwell within the realm of possibility. Countries that have previously been viewedas less of a factor in global strategies are taking on new and unexpected rolesin the unfolding drama that is reshaping our world.The last two years of the twentieth century, for example, saw a number of newcountries joining the exclusive ranks of those possessing nuclear arms. Ofparticular note were the surprise weapons tests of India and Pakistan. In spiteof adamant pleas for restraint by the United Nations Security Council, Russia,and the United States, the two technological rivals have continued to test theirweapons and delivery systems, defending their peacetime escalation of nuclearweapons in the interest of national security.Though many scoff at the possibility of a global war, believing that the horrorsof World War II are too fresh in our memory to allow such an event again, it isimportant to remain vigilant and discerning, and to recognize the significanceof global events that, at first, may seem far away with little relevance tohome.The late-century crisis in Kosovo offered an example of just such events. Thoughthey appeared to casual observers to have “come out of nowhere,” the conflictsleading to the Kosovo crisis actually stem from centuries-old tensions in aportion of Eastern Europe that many analysts refer to as the “Balkan powderkeg.” Following the ethnic cleansing and wartime atrocities witnessed by theworld in Bosnia less that a decade before, the nations of the West wereunwilling to allow a similar tragedy to continue in Kosovo. The intent,duration, and form of military intervention, however, were factors that dividedeven the allied forces attempting to intervene. The struggle for power inEastern Europe offers a clear study on how regional strife may unexpectedlypolarize the great powers of the world into precarious positions on oppositesides of the negotiating table.The Balkan area is only one example of a political situation with vast militaryimplications. As the United Nations monitors the events unfolding in Europe, italso continues to enforce an embargo and military restrictions on Iraq.Threatened by the buildup of chemical and biological weapons, Iraq has beenviewed as yet another powder keg, this one in the Middle East. Even thatcountry's Arab neighbors, those traditionally considered to be its allies,disapprove of Iraq's new weapons capabilities and the destabilization of whatwas already a delicate balance of power in a volatile part of the world.During a time that many have considered relatively peaceful on a global scale,the last twenty years have, in fact, been a time of tragedy and tremendoussuffering on a localized basis. The death toll resulting from separatistmovements and religious and civil wars is estimated to be over four and a halfmillion lives, a number representing the entire population of the state ofLouisiana or the entire country of Israel. When the conflict in Tibet isfactored in, the loss of human life escalates by at least another million, andpossibly more.[images/00025.jpg] These statistics certainly describe something other than a peaceful world! Untilthe late 1990s, however, such conflicts appeared to be localized and, thoughtragic, less relevant in the daily lives of the people of the Western world.Events late in 1998 and in 1999, however, changed our worldview, with mass mediabringing the horror of regional conflicts and isolated wars into our homes andclassrooms in a way never seen before. Additionally, situations such as thebreakdown of peace negotiations between Israel and the state of Palestine,continued tensions in Northern Ireland, and a sudden leap in China's nucleartechnology contribute to what many scholars believe are the precursors ofwell-known prophecies tumbling into place, the global positioning of a thirdgreat war. The sheer number of conflicts presents a threat to global stabilitythat becomes a greater possibility as tensions increase."},{"pageContent":"VISIONS OF WARAncient prophecies do, in fact, abound with visions of a millennial breakdown ingovernments, followed by a time of an especially widespread and horrible war.The apostle Matthew, for example, referred to our time in history as one when“you will hear of wars and reports of wars… nation will rise against nation andkingdom against kingdom.”7 [index_split_092.html#filepos520952] Often includedin such prophecies are a variety of interpretations as to the cause and natureof the outcome. Ranging from shortages of natural resources such as water andoil to disagreements over fertile land, many prophets have seen the birth of thethird millennium as a time of unprecedented warfare between the great powers ofthe earth. A nearly universal theme of conflict pervades the end-of-centuryforecasts from the well-known visions of Edgar Cayce and Nostradamus to those ofsuch lesser known prophets as Bishop Christianos Ageda and a Bavarian visionarynamed Stormberger.Born in the eighteenth century, Stormberger demonstrated remarkable precision inhis prophecies of a twentieth-century world. Among his predictions were thespecifics of a conflict that became World War II, the Great Depression, and athird global tribulation, another world war: “After the second great strugglebetween the nations will come a third universal conflagration, which will decideeverything. There will be entirely new weapons. In one day more men will perishthan in all the previous wars together. Enormous catastrophes will take place.”8[index_split_092.html#filepos521210]Of particular interest in Stromberger's future vision is his comment that thewar will come as a surprise to many. He sees those that do recognize what ishappening as incapable of sharing their insights: “The nations of the earth willenter into these calamities with open eyes. They shall not be aware of what istaking place, and those who will know and speak will be silenced. The thirdgreat war will be the end of many nations.”9[index_split_092.html#filepos521336] Stromberger is unclear on whether the endof the nations will be due to their being absorbed by other powers or to theirdevastation from the new weapons.In some of his clearest quatrains, Nostradamus describes his millennial visionof war as occurring in the year 2000. In Centuries X, quatrain 74, he writes:“In the year that the great seventh is completed [2000], there shall occur atthe time of slaughter not far from the start of the grand millennium.…”10[index_split_092.html#filepos521457]Calling to mind the hundreds of thousands of refugees forced to flee the Balkanstates in the last years of the second millennium, Bishop Christianos Agedaforesaw in his fourth-century prophecy a time when “there will be wars and furythat will last a long time; whole provinces shall be emptied of theirinhabitants, and kingdoms shall be thrown into confusion.”11[index_split_092.html#filepos521612]In a document that became know as the Prophecy of Warsaw, an eighteenth-centuryPolish monk described the great war as a time of “poisonous clouds, and rayswhich burn more deeply than the sun on the equator; armies will march encased iniron; flying ships full of dreadful bombs and arrows, and flying stars withsulfuric fire which exterminate entire cities in an instant.”12[index_split_092.html#filepos521739]From the previous sampling, a clear thread of similarity emerges as eachprophecy describes a time of tragedy, war, and death. While such prophecies arecertainly open to interpretation, the fact that virtually every major beliefsystem sees its prophecies being fulfilled in this era certainly warrants aclose look at current situations. The key to reading such prophetic statements,some as old as India's epic poem, the Mahabharata,*[index_split_082.html#filepos487797] is that they represent possibilities only,descriptions of events that have not played out as yet. Previous discussionsoffered an explanation of how accounts of such detail may have been inspiredcenturies before their time. Additionally, the discussions have offered acontext within which to view these and other predictions as glimpses of a vastarray of possible futures. Rather than discounting such visions as “millennialmadness” or “apocalyptic jargon,” perhaps we are better served by askingourselves what we can learn from such insights.Amid the ambiguity of ancient prophecies and predictions, one thing remainscertain. For hundreds and in some cases thousands of years, ancient prophetshave seen something in our future that disturbed them. Whether the prophecy wasmade fifty or 2,500 years ago, the visions of the prophets remain remarkablysimilar. In the words of their day, they have described their experiences in aneffort to avert the tragedy of their visions. The opportunity of our time is toreconcile current events and determine the role and viability ofancient visions in our modern lives. We must ask ourselves if the conditions ofour world today fulfill the visions seen from another time. If so, perhaps ourlifetime represents the days when “every secret thing shall be revealed”13[index_split_092.html#filepos521866] and when at last we employ our forgottentechnology of prayer to redirect the ancient visions of tragedy and suffering."},{"pageContent":"MASS PRAYER AND MUSTARD SEEDSIn addition to the written predictions of ancient prophets, the conditions thatprecede a time of great warfare are held in the oral traditions of many nativepeoples. Perhaps the events that pave the way for such tragedy are bestsummarized by the people of peace themselves, the Hopi. In a portion of theirnative prophecy, the Hopi eloquently remind us that each time humanity straysfrom the natural laws that affirm life in this world, our choices are mirroredin our societies and the systems of nature around us. As the hearts and minds ofmankind become so separate that they forget one another, the earth acts to bringthe memory of our greatest attributes back into focus. “When earthquakes,floods, hailstorms, drought, and famine will be the life of every day, the timewill have then come for the return to the true path.” In addition to offeringthe signs of such a time, the Hopi traditions go even further, recommending acourse of action to bring the hearts and minds of man into alignment with theearth once again.Deceptively simple, the prophecy reminds us that “when prayer and meditation areused rather than relying on new inventions to create more imbalance, then they[humanity] will also find the true path.”14 [index_split_092.html#filepos522140]The words of the Hopi serve as simple reminders of the quantum principle whichstates that to change the outcome of events already in motion, we are invited toshift our beliefs regarding the outcome itself. In doing so, we attract thepossibility that matches our new belief, and we release the present conditions,even those already under way.Recent studies into the effects of prayer offer new credibility to ancientpropositions suggesting that we may “do something” about the horrors of ourworld, both present and future. These studies add to a growing body of evidencesuggesting that focused prayers, especially those offered on a large scale, havea predictable and measurable effect on the quality of life during the time ofthe prayer. Documenting statistical changes in daily life, such as specificcrimes and traffic accidents, while prayers are offered, a series of studiesshows a direct relationship between the prayers and the statistics. During thetime of the prayers, the statistics drop. When the prayers end, the statisticsreturn to previous levels.Scientists suspect that the relationship between mass prayer and the activity ofindividuals in communities is due to a phenomenon known as the field effect ofconsciousness. Much like Joseph's description of the sage, where the experienceof one plant affects the entire field, studies of specific population samplesappear to bear out this relationship. Two scientists considered to have played akey role in the development of modern psychology clearly referenced such effectsin studies offered nearly one hundred years ago.In a paper originally published in 1898, for example, William James suggestedthat “there exists a continuum of consciousness uniting individual minds thatcould be directly experienced if the psychophysical threshold of perception weresufficiently lowered through refinement in the functioning nervous system.”15[index_split_092.html#filepos522350] James's paper was a modern reference to azone of consciousness, a level of universal mind, that touches each and everylife. By using specific qualities of thought, feeling, and emotion, we may tapinto this universal mind and share in its benefits. The purpose of many prayersand meditative techniques is to achieve precisely such a condition.In the words of their day, ancient teachings suggest a similar field ofconsciousness, accessed by similar methods. The Vedic traditions, for example,speak of a unified field of “pure consciousness” that permeates all ofcreation.16 [index_split_092.html#filepos522694] In such traditions, ourexperience of thought and perception are viewed as disturbances, interruptionsin an otherwise motionless field. At the same time, it is through our path ofmastering perception and thought that we may find the unifying consciousness asindividuals or as a group.This is where the application of such studies becomes crucial in global effortsto bring peace to our world. If we view conflict, aggression, and war in ourouter world as indicators of stress in our collective consciousness, thenrelieving collective stress should relieve global tensions. In the words ofMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, founder of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) programs,“All occurrences of violence, negativity, conflict crisis, or problems in anysociety are just the expression of growth of stress in collective consciousness.When the level of stress becomes sufficiently great, it bursts out intolarge-scale violence, war, and civil uprising necessitating military action.”The beauty of the field effect is that when stress is relieved within a group,the effects are registered beyond the immediate group, into an even larger area.This is the thinking that led to studies of mass meditation and prayer duringthe Israeli-Lebanese War in the early 1980s.In September 1983, studies were conducted in Jerusalem to explore therelationship between prayer, meditation, and violence. Applying new technologiesto test an ancient theory, individuals trained in the techniques of TM,considered to be a mode of prayer by prayer researchers, were placed instrategic locations within Jerusalem during the conflict with Lebanon. Thepurpose of the study was to determine if a reduction of stress in the localizedpopulations would, in fact, be reflected as less violence and aggression on aregional basis.The 1983 studies followed earlier experiments indicating that as little as onepercent of a mass population practicing unified forms of peaceful prayer andmeditation was enough to reduce crime rates, accidents, and suicides. Studiesconducted in 1972 showed that twenty-four U.S. cities, each with populationsover ten thousand, experienced a statistically measurable reduction in crimewhen as few as one percent (one hundred people for every ten thousand) of thepopulation participated in some form of meditative practice.17[index_split_092.html#filepos523104]This became known as the “Maharishi Effect.”To determine how certain modes of meditation and prayer would influence thegeneral population in the Israeli study, the quality of life was defined by astatistical index based on the number of fires, traffic accidents, occurrencesof crime, fluctuations in the stock market, and the general mood of the nation.At the peak of the experiments, 234 participants meditated and prayed in thestudy, a fraction of the population of greater Jerusalem. The results of thestudy showed a direct relationship between the number of participants and thedecrease of activity in the various categories of quality of life. When thenumbers of participants were high, the index of the various categories declined.Crime, fires, and accidents increased as the number of people praying wasreduced.18 [index_split_092.html#filepos523297]These studies demonstrated a high correlation between the number of people inprayer and the quality of life in the immediate vicinity. Similar studiesconducted in major population centers of the United States, India, and thePhilippines found similar correlations. Data from these cities between 1984 and1985 verified decreases in crime rates that “could not have been due to trendsor cycles of crime, or to changes in police policies or procedures.”19[index_split_092.html#filepos523425]"},{"pageContent":"THE HARVEST IS GREAT, THOUGH THE LABORERS ARE FEWFor centuries, prophets and sages have suggested that one-tenth of one percentof humanity, working together in a unified effort, may shift the consciousnessof the entire world. If those numbers are accurate, then a surprisingly fewindividuals may plant the seeds of great possibilities. At present thepopulation of our world is estimated to be approximately 6 billion people. Onepercent of our global neighborhood, then, is represented by 60 million, withonetenth of that number approaching 6 million people. For scale 6 million peopleis roughly three-quarters of the population of Los Angeles.Although these statistics may represent an optimum number to bring about change,the studies in Jerusalem and the other large population centers suggest that thenumbers to initiate such change may be even smaller! The studies indicate thatthe first effects of the mass meditation/prayer became noticeable when thenumber of people participating in the prayers was greater than the square rootof one percent of the population.20 [index_split_092.html#filepos523803] In acity of one million people, for example, this value represents only one hundredindividuals!Applying the localized findings of the test cities to a larger population on aglobal scale offers powerful and perhaps unexpected results. Representing only afraction of even the ancient estimates, the square root of one percent ofearth's population is just under eight thousand people! With the advent of theWorld Wide Web and computerized communication, organizing a time of coordinatedmeditation/prayer supported by a minimum of eight thousand people is certainlyfeasible. Clearly, this number represents only the minimum required for theeffect to begin—a threshold of sorts. The greater the number participating, thegreater the acceleration of the effect. Such numbers remind us of ancientadmonitions suggesting that a very few people may make a difference to an entireworld.Perhaps this is the “mustard seed” of the parable that Jesus used to demonstratethe amount of faith required of his followers. Of such faith, we are reminded inthe lost Gospel Q that “the harvest is abundant, but the workers are few.”21[index_split_092.html#filepos523946] With the evidence of such potential, whatare the implications of directing such a collective power toward the greatchallenges of our time? Perhaps we have already witnessed the effect of suchglobal choices in instances such as the peace prayer on the eve of the militaryaction in Iraq in November 1998."},{"pageContent":"TO THINK THE THOUGHTS OF ANGELSScholars, researchers, and scientists have identified the conditions that theybelieve will precipitate disasters of catastrophic proportions well into thetwenty-first century. A combination of politics, social changes, and rogueweather patterns have already taken the lives of hundreds of thousands ofindividuals, primarily women and children, in the last days of the twentiethcentury. While wellintended efforts are under way to alleviate the presentconditions, they have proven temporary at best.Rather than viewing political treaties and military solutions as answers,perhaps now is the time to recognize them as bridges to a new way of thinking.It appears that we have reached a critical time in the evolution of governmentsand nations, when the pattern of demands followed by force simply does not workthe way it did even fifty years ago. The wise use of force may serve us inisolated incidents of short duration. Each time we apply a military bandage,however, it is akin to placing our finger over a tear in the fabric of a balloonfilled with water. What appears to be a “fix” in one place becomes a bulgesomewhere else on the balloon. This is precisely the scenario that is unfoldingwith respect to global politics. To change the conditions that allow war,oppression, and mass suffering, we must change the thinking that has allowed theconditions to be present.We live in a world of collective consent. The conditions of war and suffering ona large scale mirror the elements that make such conditions possible on a smallscale. Sometimes consciously, and sometimes not, we consent to expressions ofour group will in ways that we may never suspect. On levels that we may not evenbe aware of, our thoughts, attitudes, and actions toward one another each daycontribute to the collective beliefs that agree to the wars and suffering of theworld.For example, the creation of a wartime mentality of expecting and preparing forconflict in our international world can happen only if we allow for suchconflict in our personal lives. As we live individual episodes of “defendingourselves” in romance and personal relationships, “outsmarting” others in ourschools, and “out-strategizing” coworkers and competitors, quantum physicsreminds us that these individual expressions of our lives pave the way forsimilar expressions, amplified by many orders of magnitude, in another time andplace. To know peace in our world, we must become peace in our lives. From thequantum perspective, it makes little sense to shove people impatiently out ofthe way to get to our parked vehicle, then dart in and out of traffic rudelycutting off other drivers as we race across town to a rally supporting globalpeace.The subtlety of this concept became even clearer to me in the final moments ofan interview that I was completing shortly after the crisis in Kosovo began inearly 1999. On a syndicated radio station that was heard throughout the UnitedStates, the moderator had graciously set aside the first hour of a live programfor us to develop concepts and offer broad brushstrokes of possibility beforetaking questions on a call-in line. I had just finished describing the quantumconcepts of many outcomes and the power of prayer to choose our future, when thecall came in. After introducing the caller, our host invited the gentleman onthe other end of the line to ask his question. Following praise for ourinterview and compliments for the program, the caller began.“Gregg, I understand what you have said about the power of prayer and how manypeople praying together have a greater effect than random prayers ofindividuals. Now,” he continued, “my question is, why don't you organize avigil, and let's use our power of prayer to cause a heart attack in the dictatorresponsible for all of this trouble in eastern Europe?” There was an awkwardstillness on the air, as both the moderator and I reeled from the question.“I suppose that would be my question to answer,” I said, breaking the silence.“It's all yours, Gregg,” the moderator's voice replied.“Taking the life of a world leader, even to stop the violence in his country, isto miss the point of our power of prayer. It is precisely this kind of thinkingthat has allowed the atrocities of war in the first place,” I replied. “While wemay deceive ourselves into believing that the taking of a life has solved theimmediate problem, somewhere, in some part of the world, we will see theconsequence of our actions, possibly in ways that we would never expect. Prayertranscends imposing our will upon others. Prayer represents our opportunity tobecome more than such cycles by employing our science of feeling to bring newpossibilities to an existing situation.”“I think I understand what you are saying,” the caller replied. “I hadn'tthought of it quite in those terms. Maybe, instead of killing him, we can justhurt him. Maybe that will do the trick!”The moderator interrupted with a commercial break, followed by an opportunityfor me to summarize our interview and close out the program. For the rest of theevening and for days afterward, I thought about the caller and the pain thatmust have been in his life to lead him to such conclusions. While I believe thathis question represented an extreme viewpoint, at the same time the callerdemonstrated how deeply embedded warlike thinking has become in our culture. Whyare we surprised at mass killing in our homes, offices, and schools when weagree to the same thinking on a larger scale in the name of peace?Whether we view our world from the perspective of ancient traditions or quantumphysics, we are invited to completely rethink the way that we have approachedconflict in the past. Both paradigms, science and ancient philosophy, remind usthat there can be no “us” and “them.” There is only “we,” and we have outgrownthe conditions where it is effective to impose our will and ideas of change uponthe lives of others. One look at the conflicts listed on page 229 reminds usthat while such solutions may have appeared to work in the past, they haveprobably bought us time to recognize new choices rather than lasting solutions.As we choose to honor life in our everyday world, we witness the power of ourchoices to end war and render aggression obsolete.Prayer has often been referred to as a passive act. On many occasions I havebeen asked what I am “really going to do,” with regard to a particular worldcrisis. In these instances prayer was viewed as secondary to actually “doingsomething.” From the perspective offered by ancient traditions and now supportedby modern research, our ability to commune with the forces of the cosmos, tochoose our path through time and determine our course of future history, may bethe single most sophisticated and empowering force to grace our world.Prayer is a concrete, measurable, and directive force in creation. Prayer isreal. To pray is to do “something!” What else can we do? The solutions of thepast are failing us in the present. Prayer is the act of redefining thefoundation of hate, ethnic violence, and war. The doing simply occurs in a formvery different from our idea of doing in the past. Could it be so easy? Is itpossible that to mirror the peace of our hearts in the reality of our world, weare simply asked to choose such a reality by feeling the outcome as if it hadalready happened? Recent events, in the eyes of the world, appear to say thatthe answer is yes.At the doorway to the twenty-first century, we stand on the threshold of a timewhen the survival of our species may actually depend upon our ability to marryour inner and outer sciences into precisely such technologies. As we redefinethe roles of political affiliations, military alliances, and the boundaries ofnations, the power of mass prayer cannot be discounted. The implications ofapplying our technology of prayer on a global scale are of immense, perhapsunfathomable proportions. Our lifetime represents a rare moment when, perhapsfor the first time in our history, we can determine the outcome of this moment!Transcending science, religion, and mystic traditions, the Essenes suggest thatit is during this time in history, through the use of our lost science of prayerand prophecy, that healing comes to all beings, those formed and unformed, andthat peace prevails in all worlds. It is during our lifetime that the people ofearth will know all of the secrets of the “angels in heaven.”Without judging the events of each day as good, bad, right, or wrong, we areinvited to choose a new viewpoint, a higher option in response to the horror ofsuch events. If the tenets of prayer and peace are valid, then the pain of thosein Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and anywhere else where human life issuffering is our suffering as well. The ancient secrets of healing remind usthat there is only one of us here in our world. As we alleviate the pain ofothers, we alleviate our pain as well. As we love others, we love ourselves.Each man, woman, and child of this world has the power to create a newpossibility, to change the thinking that allows suffering.Those who have come before us prepared us well for this time in our history. Wehave the opportunity to choose a new way in the presence of challenges thatappear to be mounting on a daily basis. We are invited to think and do in ourworld as those of the heavens do in theirs. In so doing, we awaken a forgottentechnology from the sleep of our collective memory and, at last, bring theconditions of heaven to earth.In their own words, the scholars of Qumran recorded the teachings of their greatmasters preserved for moments such as this, when the encouragement of those whohave come before us gives us the strength to live and love in this world, onemore day. We are reminded that “to lift our eyes to heaven when the eyes ofothers are on the ground is not easy. To worship at the feet of the angels whenothers worship fame and riches is not easy. But perhaps the most difficult ofall is to think the thoughts of the angels, to speak the words of the angels,and to do as angels do.”22 [index_split_092.html#filepos524182]> * [index_split_079.html#filepos462780] Used to teach Hindu traditions, the> Mahabharata is composed of approximately 100,000 dual-lined couplets> describing dharma, or right action."},{"pageContent":"[images/00005.jpg]COMPLETIONS The story came to my attention only moments before I was to begin the firstnight of a conference that would last for the next three days. For the betterpart of the afternoon I had wondered how I would begin the program that evening.Though I had a good idea of what our time together would look like following theopening, precisely how the first moments of the night would unfold remained amystery. In such moments of uncertainty, when it seems as if reasonablesolutions exist only as glimmers of a distant possibility, I have found thatthere is usually a piece of the puzzle that is missing, something that has yetto come to my attention. My trust in that feeling, and knowing that there ismore to come, often replaces anxious moments of panic with a strange calmness.I walked into the dining area of our home and opened a large envelope that hadbeen given to me earlier in the day. It contained several accounts of humantriumph, one of which moved me so deeply that I found myself wiping the tearsfrom my face before I had even finished reading the paper. Later that evening, Ishared the story with a live audience of several hundred people. The story hadthe same effect on them. The paper that had come to me that day described anincident occurring at the Special Olympics of 1998.The Special Olympics was organized as an opportunity for children and youngadults to join together in the spirit of friendly competition. What makes theseOlympic games different is that each individual competes with the challenge ofphysical or mental conditions that prevent him or her from participating in theInternational World Olympics that capture the world's attention every fouryears. This particular article was the story of nine children who had becomefriends during their time at the Olympic camp in 1998.One morning they found themselves competing together on the same track, in thesame event. At the sound of the starting gun, they were off toward the finishline at the other end of the course. It was a young boy with Down's syndromethat made this account so powerful. As the other competitors bounded down thetrack using whatever skills they had to work toward the finish, this special boyslowed down and looked back to the starting line. He saw that one of histeammates had fallen at the beginning of the race and was struggling to standup.The boy with Down's syndrome suddenly stopped, turned, and began walking backtoward his friend. One by one, each of the other competitors realized what washappening, turned and followed, until they had retraced their steps to the pointwhere they had begun. Lifting their friend to his feet, they locked arms, andtogether walked down the track to the finish. In that moment those nine childrenredefined the rules of the competition. With the clock still ticking away, theymoved beyond the limits of time and sport to create an experience where theyeach finished in their own way, all at the same time. It made no sense for oneof them to arrive at the finish without the others.This story is important for two reasons. Each time it is shared, the image ofthe children working together elicits a powerful emotion. Rather than sadness orfrustration, it is often described as an emotion of hope. That emotion opens thedoor to greater possibilities and new outcomes in our lives. Additionally, theaccount provides a beautiful example of how a group of young people, in theinnocence of their love for one another, redefined the outcome of theirexperience by applying a new rule to an existing condition. In their own way,the children of the Special Olympics remind us of the great possibilities of ourlives, as we move through a rare moment of history.We have been shown that it is possible to redefine the parameters of prophecyfor our future. The evidence reminds us that we intercede on our own behalf eachtime we respond to the challenges of our daily lives. Perhaps the best way todemonstrate such possibilities to ourselves is to explore the nature ofcompassion, time, forgiveness, and prayer through the eyes of those who havecome before us. In the words of their time, we are reminded that there is onlyone of us here and, above all other reasons, we have come to this world to love."},{"pageContent":"[images/00005.jpg]NOTES INTRODUCTION> 1.
