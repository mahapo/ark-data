At that time it was common tosay that we had “wired” a message to someone, meaning that we had sent atelegraph message. Later meanings have varied from the jitters caused byingesting too much caffeine or certain drugs to the way the neurons in ourbrains are connected. It’s for these reasons that I’m clarifying my intent forthe word right up front, before it’s used in the following pages."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [contents.xhtml#toc2]image [images/img-11-1.png]Our Origin: Why It Matters [contents.xhtml#toc2]Since our earliest ancestors looked with awe into the distant stars of amoonless night sky, a single question has been asked countless times bycountless numbers of people sharing the same experience through the ages. Thequestion they’ve asked speaks directly to the core of every challenge that willever test us in life, no matter how big or how small. It’s at the heart of everychoice we’ll ever face, and it forms the foundation for every decision we’llever make. The question that’s at the root of all questions asked during theestimated 200,000 years or so that we’ve been on earth is simply this: Who arewe?In what may be the greatest irony of our lives, following 5,000 years ofrecorded history and technological achievements that stagger the imagination, wehave yet to answer this most basic question with certainty.Key 1: In the presence of the greatest technological advancements of the modernworld, science still cannot answer the most fundamental question of ourexistence: Who are we?WHY OUR ORIGIN MATTERSThe way we answer the question of how we came to be as we are penetrates theessence of each moment of our lives. It forms the perceptual eyes—thefilters—through which we see other people, the world around us, and mostimportantly, ourselves. For example, when we think of ourselves as separate fromour bodies, we approach the healing process feeling like powerless victims of anexperience that we have no control over. Conversely, recent discoveries confirmthat when we approach life knowing that our bodies are designed to constantlyrepair, rejuvenate, and heal, this shift in perspective creates the chemistry inour cells that mirrors our belief.1 [endnotes.xhtml#fn1]Our self-esteem, our self-worth, our sense of confidence, our well-being, andour safety stem directly from the way we think of ourselves in the world. Fromthe person we say yes to when it comes to choosing a life partner and how longour relationship lasts once we create it, to what jobs we feel worthy ofperforming, the most important decisions we’ll ever make in life are based inthe way we answer the simple, timeless question Who are we?On a more spiritual level, our answer creates the foundation for the way we viewour relationship with God. It even justifies our thinking when it comes totrying to save a human life, and when we choose to end one.The way we think of ourselves is reflected in what we teach our children aswell. When their delicate sense of self-worth is threatened by relentlessbullying from rivals and classmates, for example, it’s their answer to Who am I?that gives them the strength to heal their hurt. Their answer can even make thedifference between when they feel worthy of living and when they don’t.On a larger scale, the way we think of ourselves determines the policies ofcorporations and nations that either justify dumping 12-million-plus tons ofused plastic and thousands of gallons of radioactive waste into the world’soceans each year or show we cherish the living oceans enough to invest inpreserving them.Even how countries choose to create the borders that separate them and how ourgovernments justify sending armies across those borders onto the land and intothe homes of the people of another nation begins with the way we view ourselvesas people. When we think about it, our answer to the most basic question—Who arewe?—is at the core of everything we do and defines all that we cherish.Key 2: Everything from our self-esteem to our self-worth, our sense ofconfidence, our well-being, and our sense of safety, as well as the way we seethe world and other people, stems from our answer to the question Who are we?It’s precisely because the way we think of ourselves plays such a vital role inour lives that we owe it to ourselves to explain who we are and where we camefrom as truthfully and honestly as possible. This includes taking intoconsideration every source of information available to us, from the leading-edgescience of today to the wisdom of 5,000 years of human experience. This alsoincludes changing the existing story when new discoveries give us the reasons todo so.WHY WE NEED A NEW STORYOver 150 years ago, geologist Charles Darwin published a paradigm-shatteringbook entitled On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, oftenshortened simply to Origin of Species. His book was intended to provide ascientific explanation for the complexity of life—how it has morphed over theages from primitive cells to the complex forms we see today. Darwin believedthat the evolution he witnessed in some parts of the world, in some forms oflife, applied to all life everywhere, including human life.In one of the great ironies of the modern world, since Darwin’s time the veryscience that was expected to support his theory, and eventually solve life’smysteries, has done just the opposite. The most recent discoveries are revealingfacts that fly in the face of long-standing scientific tradition, especiallywhen it comes to human evolution. Among these facts are the following.Fact 1: The relationships shown on the conventional human evolutionary tree—thedashed lines that connect one fossil to another and lead to modern humans at thetop of the tree—are not based on evidence. While these relationships arebelieved to exist, they have never been proven and are inferred or speculativerelationships.Fact 2: Modern humans arose suddenly on earth approximately 200,000 years agowith the advanced features that set us apart from all other known forms of lifealready developed.Fact 3: The lack of common DNA between ancient Neanderthals, thought to be someof our ancestors, and early humans, whose DNA is similar to ours, tells us thatwe did not originally descend from the Neanderthals, even if we interbred withthem at some point.Fact 4: Advanced genome analysis reveals that the DNA that sets us apart fromother primates is the result of an ancient, mysterious, and precise fusion ofgenes that suggests something beyond evolution made our humanness possible.To be clear, the advanced features identified in Fact 2 didn’t develop slowlyover long periods of time, as evolutionary theory would suggest. Instead,characteristics that include a brain 50 percent larger than that of our nearestprimate relative and a complex nervous system with emotional and sensoryabilities fine-tuned to our world already existed in modern humans when theyappeared. And humans haven’t changed.In other words, contemporary humans are the same humans, 2,000 centuries later!These facts, which are based upon peer-reviewed science, present a problem forthe long-held evolutionary story of our origins. The new evidence clearlydoesn’t support the conventional narrative of the past that we’ve been taught.The popular story that’s being shared in our classrooms and textbooks todayleads us to believe we’re insignificant beings that began as a biological flukelong ago, then endured 200,000 years of brutal competition and “survival of thestrongest,” only to discover that we’re powerless victims in a hostile world ofseparation, competition, and conflict.The scientific discoveries described in this book, however, now suggestsomething radically different. It’s for this reason that we need a new story toaccommodate the new evidence. Or conversely, we need to follow the evidence wealready have to the new story that it tells.Before his death in 1962, Nobel Prize–winning physicist Niels Bohr reminded usthat the key to solving a mystery is found within the mystery itself. “Everygreat and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution,” he said. “It forcesus to think differently in order to find it.”2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn2] Bohr’s wordsare just as powerful today as when he spoke them over half a century ago.From fossils and grave sites to brain size and DNA, the existing evidence isalready solving the mystery of the origin of our kind. It’s already telling usour new story. The key is that we must first think differently about ourselvesin order to accept what the story reveals. I’ve written this book as aninvitation to do just that.Key 3: By allowing new discoveries to lead to the new stories they tell, ratherthan forcing them into a predetermined framework of ideas, we may, at last,answer the most important questions of our existence.WHY THIS BOOK?The purpose of this book is to 1) reveal new discoveries about our origin, inPart I, and 2) show how to apply these discoveries in our day-to-day lives, inPart II. Rather than speculate upon how the first cell of life appeared upon theearth, I’ll begin as Darwin did, at the time following our mysterious origin.Both Part I and Part II include exercises to help anchor the significance ofspecific discoveries in your own life.WHAT THIS BOOK IS NOT * Science of Self-Empowerment is not a science book. Although I will share the leading-edge science that invites us to rethink our relationship to the world, this work has not been written to conform to the format or standards of a classroom science textbook or a technical journal. * Science of Self-Empowerment is not a religious book. It’s not intended to support any particular religious belief regarding creation or human origins, such as Creationism. Science of Self-Empowerment is based upon the peer-reviewed scientific evidence (anthropological, paleontological, biological, and genetic) that begins immediately after our species appeared on earth. As such, there are places where the new story in this book may appear contrary to the traditional stories of religion, as well as to those of traditional science. * Science of Self-Empowerment is not a peer-reviewed research paper. Each chapter has not gone through the lengthy review process of a certified board or a selected panel of experts conditioned to see our world through the eyes of a single field of study, such as physics, math, or psychology.WHAT THIS BOOK IS * This book is well researched and well documented. I’ve written Science of Self-Empowerment in a reader-friendly way that incorporates true-life accounts, scientific discoveries, and personal experiences to support an empowering way of seeing ourselves in the world. * This book is an example of what can be accomplished when we cross the traditional boundaries between science and spirituality. By marrying state-of-the-art discoveries of biology, genetics, and earth sciences with ancient wisdom, we gain a powerful framework for understanding what’s possible in our lives.NEW DISCOVERIES MEAN A NEW STORYIf we’re honest with ourselves and acknowledge that the world is changing, thenit makes sense that our story in the world must change as well. In alllikelihood, the new human story will be a hybrid of theories that already exist.These will be woven together into the new tapestry of a grand chronicle thatdescribes an extraordinary and epic past. And with this new story, at last we’llembrace the history that cannot be accounted for in any of the existing theoriesby themselves.A growing body of evidence suggests that we are the product of something morethan random mutations and lucky biology. But the evidence can only go so far.Fossils, DNA, ancient cave art, and human burial sites can only show us theremnants of what happened in the past. They cannot tell us why those thingshappened. Unless we find a way to travel backward in time, the truth is that wemay never know the complete why of what has made our existence possible.But maybe we don’t need to know. Maybe it’s not necessary to have that level ofdetail for us to shift the way we think about ourselves and change our lives.The discovery that we are the product of something more than evolution—verylikely a conscious and intelligent act of creation—may be all we need to pointus in a new, honest, and healthy direction when it comes to the human story.The undeniable fact is that something happened 200,000 years ago to make ourexistence possible. And whatever that something was, it left us with theextraordinary abilities of intuition, compassion, empathy, love, self-healing,and more.We owe it to ourselves to embrace the body of evidence, the story it tells, andthe healing it can bring to our lives. The power of the emerging human story mayhelp us bring true and lasting healing to the racial hate, the sexual violence,the religious intolerance, and the other devastating challenges we face, rangingfrom the abuse of technology to the plague of terrorism that’s sweeping theearth. To do anything less is simply to place a Band-Aid on the emotional woundthat creates these expressions of fear.For the first time in the 300-year-long history of science, we’re writing a newhuman story that gives us a new answer to the timeless question of who we are.Key 4: New DNA evidence suggests that we’re the result of an intentional act ofcreation that has imbued us with extraordinary abilities of intuition,compassion, empathy, love, and self-healing.This book is written with one purpose in mind: to empower us in the choices thatlead to thriving lives in a transformed world.Gregg BradenSanta Fe, New Mexico"},{"pageContent":"image [images/img-19-1.png]contents.xhtml#toc3"},{"pageContent":"image [images/img-21-1.png]The purpose of the following chapters is to empower you with new ways ofthinking and new reasons to think differently about yourself and therelationships in your life: the relationships that you have with other people,the relationship that you have with the earth and the world around you, therelationship that you have with yourself, and ultimately, the relationship youhave with God / Spirit / Universal Source / the One.

I remember the sensation of feeling both awake and asleep at the same timeand thinking that maybe I was dreaming. It didn’t even occur to me that I couldopen my eyes to see who the man was. Then I heard his voice again, this timespeaking my name. “Gregg . . . you’re okay. You did great. But I need you totell me why you’re here.” This time I knew I wasn’t dreaming—the man knew myname and he was speaking directly to me. Instinctively, my eyes began to open asI turned my head in his direction. The light overhead was so bright that itforced me to squint as I looked up at the ceiling from my bed. Surprisingly, theman wasn’t far away at all. In fact he was standing right next to me, lookingdown at me from behind a blue surgical mask. Seeing him jolted my memory andsuddenly I remembered what was happening.I was awakening from the anesthesia I’d been given earlier that morning. I wasin the post-operation recovery room of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.The voice I was hearing was the doctor who had reassured me only an hour or soearlier that I was in good hands with his team, and that I would be okay. Andwhile he continued his assurances, I wasn’t prepared for the question he keptasking about why I was there.Less than a month before, an examination at a different clinic had shown ananomalous growth on the wall of my bladder. “Something is in your bladder thatshouldn’t be there,” that first doctor had told me. “It needs to be removed.”Wanting to ensure the best possible outcome for whatever was needed, I’d gone tothe prestigious Mayo Clinic for a second opinion. It was there that I discoveredthat the only way to determine with certainty that the growth was benign was totest the tissue itself—to perform a biopsy.What was happening now, however, was not part of the original plan. After beingfully anesthetized and prepped for surgery, I was waking up to a puzzled doctorasking a question that I could barely answer in my altered state ofconsciousness: Why was I there? He was asking the question because the anomalousgrowth that had shown up in the previous exams was no longer there. The surgeonwas telling me there was nothing to remove because I had a normal andhealthy-looking bladder. To emphasize his point, he showed me a color photographof the inside of my bladder, taken only moments before.As I did my best to grasp what he was saying, the surgeon used the tip of hispen as a pointer to show me where the growth had been in the earlier scans. Heemphasized, however, that today there was no bruising, no discoloration, and noscar tissue or any sign whatsoever to indicate that anything out of the ordinaryhad ever existed. And he wanted to know why. He wanted to know how such a thingcould have happened.In my groggy state I was not as eloquent with my answer as I would have liked. Idid my best to tell the doctor about the research I’d done into the self-healingpotential of the human body, the ancient traditions that had mastered thishealing potential, and the science that now confirms that our bodies can healthemselves when given the conditions to do so. The last memory I have of thisdoctor is of him turning away and walking toward the door as I tried my best toanswer his question. The explanation I was offering for what we’d bothexperienced that day was obviously not what he had expected, nor what he wanted,to hear.When I thought about my doctor’s response later, after my recovery, I couldunderstand his frustration. There is absolutely nothing in the training of amodern medical professional that allows for us to have such self-healingrelationships with our bodies. And it’s for precisely this reason that when anexperience such as mine occurs, the medical team has limited options when itcomes to offering an explanation. They generally chalk it up to a mistakendiagnosis, an unexplainable spontaneous recovery, or simply a miracle.From my doctor’s point of view, a miracle had just happened in his operatingroom and he was trying to make sense of it. From my point of view, however, whathad happened was less about a miracle and more about a technology—a powerfulinner technology that’s available to each of us—whose existence has been largelyforgotten over time.Since 1986, I have researched the wisdom, studied the principles, and wherepossible, experienced the techniques embraced by ancient and indigenoustraditions when it comes to our ability to self-heal. From the monks, nuns, andabbots in the monasteries of Tibet, Nepal, and Egypt to the indigenous healersand shamans of the Yucatán jungles in Mexico and the Andes Mountains of southernPeru, our ancient ancestors, and their modern counterparts, have done their bestto preserve the knowledge of the most intimate relationship we can ever have:our relationship with our own bodies. And while the knowledge they preserved isnot science in the traditional sense, new scientific discoveries in genetics,molecular biology, and the new fields of epigenetics and neurocardiology haveconfirmed many of the relationships described in the ancient traditions.When it came to my own body, however, even though I strongly believed thatself-healing was possible and had even witnessed other people’s success at it, acombination of my scientific training and the limiting beliefs instilled in meat an early age by my alcoholic father and dysfunctional family environment hadleft a deep doubt that such a healing was possible for me. So even though I’dperformed the yogic techniques, qigong, and other healing modalities, taken themedicinal herbs, adopted a raw diet, and accepted emotional changes to the bestof my ability between my diagnosis and the procedure at the Mayo Clinic, I stilldoubted my capacity to create for myself the successful healings that I’d seenoccur with others. And it was because of my doubt that I had chosen the moderntechnology offered through one of the highest-rated medical facilities in theworld as a responsible option for the diagnosis I’d received.As a trained scientist, I cannot say to you that the practices, techniques, andlifestyle changes I adopted during those two weeks were the reason the medicalteam found nothing to remove the day of my surgery. What I can say is that newscientific discoveries have identified a link between specific healingmodalities known in the past and their ability to restore balance in our bodies.It’s the fact of this relationship that invites an honest reassessment of thelimiting story we’ve been told about our origin as a species and what we’recapable of. When we consider the facts revealed by the best science of today,spontaneous healings and miracles such as the one I experienced seem less rareand extraordinary and more like an ordinary part of everyday life. The chaptersthat follow reveal these discoveries and the story they tell. And with thatlarger story, we’re given the reasons to embrace a new answer to the questionWho are we? and to write our new human story.image [images/img-27-1.png]If you’ve ever felt that there’s more to the story of our past than we’ve beenled to believe, I want you to know you’re not alone. A 2014 Gallup poll revealedthat in the United States alone, a whopping 42 percent of the people who wereasked believe that there’s something more to human origins than is typicallyacknowledged in the mainstream—that something beyond Charles Darwin’s theory ofevolution is responsible for our existence.1 [endnotes.xhtml#fn3] The results ofthis poll reflect a growing sense that we humans are part of something great,powerful, and mysterious. Some of the greatest minds in science agree.SOMETHING IS MISSING FROM THE HUMAN STORYFrancis Crick, the Nobel Prize–winning co-discoverer of the DNA double helix,believed that the eloquence of life’s building blocks has to be the result ofsomething more than a lucky quirk of nature. Through his pioneering research, hewas one of the first humans to witness the complexity and the sheer beauty ofthe molecule that makes life possible. Late in life, Crick risked his reputationas a scientist by publicly stating, “An honest man, armed with all the knowledgeavailable to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of lifeappears at the moment to be almost a miracle.”2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn4] In thescientific world, this statement is the equivalent of heresy, suggesting thatsomething more than chance evolution led to our existence.The feeling that there’s something more to our story is not just a recentphenomenon. Archaeological discoveries show that, almost universally, ancienthumans felt connected to more than just their immediate surroundings. Theysensed that we have our roots in other worlds, some that we can’t even see, andthat we are ultimately part of a cosmic family that lives in those worlds.The sacred text of the ancient Mayan Popol Vuh, for example, describes how the“Forefathers” created humankind, while the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Torahdescribe how we are the descendants of wise and powerful beings linked to agreater and otherworldly intelligence.3 [endnotes.xhtml#fn5],4[endnotes.xhtml#fn6],5 [endnotes.xhtml#fn7] Could there be a simple explanationas to why such a sense has remained with us so strongly, across such diversetraditions, and has lasted for so long? Is it possible that our feeling ofhaving an intentional origin and a greater potential is based in somethingthat’s true?When we ask Who are we? the short answer is that we’re not what we’ve been toldand we’re more than most of us have ever imagined.WE ARE A SPECIES OF STORIESFrom the time of our earliest ancestors, we’ve used stories to explain the worldaround us and describe our place in it. Sometimes our stories are based in fact.Sometimes they’re not. Some stories are metaphorical. We’ve used these storiesto explain the unexplained and make sense of our existence.The ancient Egyptians, for example, thought of the earth, the space beneath theearth, and the sky above as worlds unto themselves. In their view of creation,the earth beneath their feet was floating upon Nun, a primordial ocean that wasthe source of the Nile River. The sky above was formed by the body of thegoddess Nut. The dome of Nut’s rounded belly was the home of the sun and thestars as she arched over the earth, facedown, throughout time. The realm underthe earth, Duat, was where the sun would go at night as it disappeared beneaththe horizon at sunset.6 [endnotes.xhtml#fn8]All these realms had deities—gods and goddesses—associated with them that playeda powerful role in the daily lives of the Egyptian people. And while the storiesweren’t based in science, they worked for the people of the time. They provideda mechanism to explain what the ancient Egyptians saw happening in theireveryday world and helped them know where they fit in.Today, we continue to use stories to explain our world. And our stories play arole that’s more important than ever. Not only do they inform the way we manageeverything from disease and healing to our relationships and romances; on aglobal level, the future of our planet and the survival of our species, whichnow hang in the balance, also depend on the stories we choose to embrace. It’sprecisely for these reasons that it’s vital we tell ourselves the right story.OUR STORIES DEFINE OUR LIVESWe cherish the stories we create. As individuals we often proudly share ourfamily history and the accomplishments of our ancestors. As nations we defendwith pride our teams’ athletic achievements at the Olympics, the scientific andtechnical advancements that sent our astronauts to the moon, and the flags thatunite us as countries. But sometimes we find ourselves defending stories thatwe’ve grown up with even when new discoveries tell us these stories are wrong.It’s our willingness to cling to a story that’s familiar, even if new evidenceshows us it’s obsolete, that may be the greatest hurdle we face as we learn toembrace our world of extremes in a healthy way.Key 5: The stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves—and believe—define ourlives.A commonly used axiom suggests that if we hear something said often enough webegin to accept that something as fact, whether or not it’s true. The sanitizedstory of smoking tobacco that was generally accepted until the early 1960s is aperfect example. Prior to a 1964 report on the dangerous effects of cigarettesmoking, America’s tobacco companies were engaged in a powerful media campaignto convince the public that smoking was a safe, even a healthy, habit. Catchyslogans such as “When tempted to over-indulge, reach for a Lucky instead,” “Iprotect my voice with Luckys,” and “As your dentist I would recommend Viceroys”were common in magazine, radio, and television advertisements.7[endnotes.xhtml#fn9]A particularly disturbing poster for Camel cigarettes from the 1940s statedthat, according to a nationwide survey, “More doctors smoke Camels than anyother cigarette.”8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn10] A further investigation into the surveyrevealed the rest of the story. The questions had been asked of doctors who hadreceived complimentary packs of Camel cigarettes at meetings and conferencesbefore they took the survey. It was after they’d received the free samples thatthey were asked what brand they liked best or had in their pockets. The sampleseffectively skewed the answer in favor of Camels. American consumers trusted andbelieved these and other ads. After all, if a cigarette was safe for doctors, itmust be safe for everyone else, right?The perception of such messages, and of tobacco use itself, however, changedforever with the landmark study from the surgeon general. For the first time,the study reported scientifically what many people had suspected intuitively. Itdescribed a direct link between tobacco use, chronic bronchitis, and lungcancer. The study stated, “It is the judgment of the committee that cigarettesmoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseasesand to the overall death rate.”9 [endnotes.xhtml#fn11] By 1965, the tobaccoindustry was required to place the now-familiar warning labels on every tobaccoproduct sold.The point of this example is to illustrate that a belief once shared by themainstream media and the general public—the story that smoking tobacco issafe—changed over time. It had to change because the evidence of debilitatingdiseases experienced by so many tobacco users simply didn’t fit the mainstreamstory of safety and health. It didn’t jibe with what people actuallyexperienced.WE’RE SOLVING 21ST-CENTURY PROBLEMS WITH 19TH-CENTURY THINKINGIn a similar way, an information campaign to skew public opinion is happeningtoday when it comes to us and the story of our origin. The 19th-century theoryof human evolution is taught as undisputed fact in today’s classrooms, leavingno room for consideration of any other possible explanation for the mystery ofour existence. And because the mainstream story does not take into accountrecent discoveries, it leaves us unprepared to address the radical social issuesand global challenges we’re experiencing today, including everything fromterrorism, bullying, and hate crimes to the epidemic of drug and alcohol abuseamong young people.Because we are invested in the theory of evolution, we use it to guide ourdecisions, and so we celebrate competition and force over cooperation andcompassion. Among other things, we keep trying to solve problems associated withour racial, religious, and sexual diversity through the obsolete thinking ofcompetition and “survival of the strongest”—both of which are key components ofthe theory of evolution. It makes no sense when we think about it, and yet, forreasons of habit, money, ego, and power, the mainstream educational system andeducators cling to an outdated story of human origins that’s no longer supportedby the evidence. Both the tobacco story and the story of human originsillustrate perfectly why it’s important to get our stories right—and what canhappen when we don’t.CHANGE THE STORY, CHANGE YOUR LIFEWhen it comes to the human family, the shared stories of our successes, thememories of our tragedies, and the inspiring examples of our heroism are thethreads that connect us. Our connection is powerful, primal, and necessary.Whether it’s the big issues of politics, religion, or shipping weapons to“freedom fighters” in war-torn countries half a world away, or deeply personalissues such as the right of a gay man to marry or a woman’s right to control herown body, modern technology now allows us to share the stories that justify ourchoices and the future we want to create.English novelist Terence David John Pratchett, known to his fans as TerryPratchett, beautifully described the awesome power of our stories when he said,“Change the story, change the world.”10 [endnotes.xhtml#fn12] I think there’s alot of truth in this statement. Our lives are reflections of what we believeabout ourselves and how the world works. Pratchett’s observation is souniversal, in fact, that we can take it one step further.In the same breath that we say, “Change the story, change the world,” we can goto an even deeper level by saying, “Change the story, change our lives.” Bothstatements are true. And both offer a powerful way of thinking in the darkestmoments of our lives.Key 6: When we change the story, we change our lives.The scientific narrative regarding the vastness of the cosmos, and ourinsignificance in it, is a perfect example of the powerful influence that astory can have on us. It also illustrates the axiom that if we tell a storyenough times we begin to accept it as true.THE OLD STORY: SMALL, POWERLESS, AND INSIGNIFICANTFor the last century and a half we’ve been steeped in a cosmic story that leavesus feeling like little more than trivial specks of dust in the universe, orbiological sidebars in the overall scheme of life. Carl Sagan described thismind-set perfectly when he commented on the scientific perspective on our placein the cosmos: “We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrumstar lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe inwhich there are far more galaxies than people.”11 [endnotes.xhtml#fn13]This kind of limited thinking, promoted by the scientific community, has led usto believe that we’re unimportant when it comes to life in general and alsoseparate from the world, from one another, and ultimately, even from ourselves.Albert Einstein echoed this perception of our insignificance when it came to hisideas about the validity of the evidence in the emerging field of quantumphysics that suggested that all things are deeply connected. Einstein couldn’taccept the fact of that connection. Leaving no doubt in our mind as to what hebelieved the new quantum ideas meant for science, Einstein said, “If quantumtheory is correct, it signifies the end of physics as a science.”12[endnotes.xhtml#fn14] His beliefs wouldn’t allow him to actually accept thepossibility that we live in a world where everything and everyone is sointimately linked.One of the reasons for Einstein’s resistance to the ideas of the new physics wasthat to live in a world of quantum connection would mean we have the ability toinfluence what happens in our lives and are faced with the responsibility forthe outcomes we create. Ultimately, it was Einstein’s firm belief that we livein a world where things are not connected that prevented him from fulfilling hislife’s dream. He passionately believed that his research would eventually leadhim to discover a scientific truth that united all the laws of nature, a “theoryof everything.” Sadly, Albert Einstein died in 1955 without seeing his elusivedream realized.With Einstein and Sagan’s legacies of separation and human insignificance inmind, it’s not surprising that we often feel helpless when it comes to whathappens in our bodies and lives. In a world of disconnection, we’re told thatthings just happen whenever and however they do. Is it any wonder that we oftenfeel powerless when we see the world changing so fast that some say it’s“falling apart at the seams”?Charles Darwin’s proposal regarding human evolution in the mid-1800s laid thefoundation for the scientific conclusions of our insignificance that came later,in the early 1900s. The theory of evolution was based upon the premise that weare the latest result of a series of chance events that have never beenwitnessed, proven, or duplicated, and we can attribute the fact that we stillexist to the “survival of the strongest” among us. The theory that struggle hasgotten us to where we are today suggests that we’re hopelessly locked into livesof competition and conflict. Culturally, this idea is now accepted to such adegree that many people believe that using force is the best way to do things inthe workplace and in the community of nations.Consciously, and sometimes on levels that are unconscious, this belief ofstruggle and conflict plays out every day in our lives. And it happens sometimesin surprising, unexpected ways. For example, when we find our “hot buttons”being triggered by those who know us best in our most intimate relationships,even the most spiritually minded among us will lash out, using hurtful tacticsto protect ourselves in the moment. The reason is not surprising.From the time we’re born, and even before, while we’re still in our mothers’wombs, we begin to learn how to cope with the world through the thoughts andfeelings of our caregivers. We learn from the tone of our mothers’ voices, forexample, when the world is safe and when it’s not. We also learn to associatethe chemicals of stress, as well as the chemicals of pleasure, that flow throughour bodies with the voices, sounds, and experiences that trigger the release ofthose chemicals.Unless we are fortunate enough to come from a really healthy family ofcaregivers, the chances are good that their responses to the world are basedupon the false conditioning they learned from the caregivers in their earlylives. And it’s precisely these patterns from other people, sometimesgenerations old, that become our patterns as well.So when we feel threatened as adults, it’s these conditioned patterns that showup in whatever way our minds deem necessary for our survival. When the patternskick in, they draw from the deep well of whatever beliefs are “hardwired” intoour subconscious minds. The key here is that these beliefs are often rooted inthe stories and experiences of other people.Do we lash out violently, as we’re conditioned to do through our stories of“survival of the strongest”? Or do we respond confidently and honestly,embracing the deeper knowledge of our connection with all life, including ourconnection with the people who’ve just triggered us?To be absolutely clear, I’m not suggesting that either response is right orwrong, good or bad. I am saying, however, that our reactions don’t lie.Regardless of what we may think we believe, the way we respond in such intimatemoments is a telling reflection of what we truly believe. The point here is thatthe stories we’re told during our most vulnerable and impressionable years ofchildhood form our most deeply held beliefs. And that’s where the story of ourorigins comes in too.A TALE OF TWO ORIGINSWe begin hearing the story of human origins early in life. And depending uponour families’ beliefs, sometimes we’re even exposed to two entirely differentand conflicting stories taught around the same time—one at home and the other atschool.In most schools we’re taught the scientific theory of evolution by naturalselection, which is a sterile and unsettling story for any young person to hear.It begins long ago with an unbelievable run of good luck, when just the rightatoms combined at just the right time to create just the right molecules underjust the right conditions to lead to the first simple forms of life that wouldeventually become the complexity of us.Even the most passionate supporter of evolution must admit that the uncannilygood fortune required for such a series of events requires a stretch ofimagination, or faith, that such a process is even possible. As notedpreviously, Francis Crick called the existence of DNA “almost a miracle.”Evolution theory accounts for this good fortune, however, suggesting that it’sthe struggle itself—the competition among varying forms of life—that made thisunlikely combination of events successful. Proponents of evolution claim thatcompetition has led us to be the present-day winners in nature’smultimillion-year-long quest to survive. The key here is that we’re told that“struggle” has served us well in the past, and by extension, still serves ustoday. In fact, struggle has been so successful, we’re told, that it’s actuallybeen “programmed” into our bodies genetically. So because of natural selection,we’re now supposedly hardwired for competition and struggle.At the same time that children are learning the scientific story of evolutionand struggle in school, they’re often told a religious story that’s equallyfrightening. This story also begins at the time of our beginning. And it alsorequires a stretch of the imagination to believe that it is even possible. InJudaism, Christianity, and Islam, this story is the story of a mysteriousforce—God—and how God created the first human from the dust of the earth,breathed life into the being he created, and caused the first human, Adam, towake upon Earth.From this story we learn that we are the descendants of Adam and his children,and that we come into this world inherently flawed as people. The rest of thestory describes how we’re destined to struggle between good and evil as wesearch for a way to redeem ourselves from our flaws. Other world religions usesimilar stories to explain the origin of humankind and the purpose of life.Both stories—the scientific and the religious—begin long ago. Both havemysterious gaps in the details. And both leave us feeling separate from the restof our world. Perhaps most importantly, both stories leave us with the feelingthat we exist as we do on earth today as unwitting combatants locked into ahopeless struggle for survival—either with nature or between good and evil. Fromeither the scientific or the religious point of view, as different as thestories may seem on the surface, when we look a little deeper, we realize thatthey start from the same place and have the same purpose. They begin with thefact that we exist as we do, and they are attempts to explain what our ancientexistence means for us today.Despite emerging evidence that does not fit with the traditional scientificstory, educators perpetuate the theory of evolution and human survival, andteach it in our classrooms, as if it were an absolute and undisputed fact. Andthis is where the problem begins: We’re trying to solve modern problems thatrequire cooperation and mutual aid through a 150-year-old story based incompetition and struggle. Not surprisingly, the story we’ve embraced—the theoryof evolution—no longer makes sense in addressing where we come from and howwe’ve become as we are. We need a new human story that reflects the new evidencein order to break the spell Darwin’s ideas have on us.BREAKING DARWIN’S SPELLDarwin published Origin of Species, his best-known book, in 1859. From the timeof its publication until today, the implications of this book have reverberatedthrough the foundation of our society. Whether it’s the academic controversy ofwhere we come from and why we’re here, or the emotionally charged issues ofconception, abortion, and the death penalty that sometimes polarize families andwhole communities, the implications of Darwin’s work impact our lives in a wayfew other ideas can. I often wonder if Darwin himself ever imagined the effectthat his work would have on the world and how deeply his ideas would influencethe lives of everyday people living over a century into his future.Before Origin of Species, there were few sources to turn to when it came toanswering life’s biggest questions. Prior to the mid-19th century, thephilosophical questions of life, such as Where do we come from? Why are we here?and How do we make life better? were relegated to religion and traditionalfolklore. With the publication of Darwin’s first book, this changed. The theoryof evolution offered a new story to answer life’s big questions that didn’trequire biblical interpretations or religious teachings.Key 7: For the first time in recorded human history, Charles Darwin’s theory ofevolution, published in 1859, allowed science to answer the big questions oflife and our origin without the need for religion.While the full title of Darwin’s book, On the Origin of Species by Means ofNatural Selection, may sound complex, the idea that it’s based upon is reallyvery simple. Darwin proposed that all life, including human life, began with asingle primal organism that mysteriously appeared on earth long ago. Darwindidn’t even attempt to describe how that organism first came into existence. Infact, contrary to what many people commonly assume, the actual origin of lifewas never his focus. While he readily acknowledged that the science of his dayhad yet to shed any meaningful light on that mystery, he also admitted thatsolving the mystery of how life began wasn’t necessary for his theory ofevolution to be accepted.Darwin defended his beliefs by using the analogy of another unsolved mystery tomake his point. He pointed to the scientific acceptance of gravity as an analogyfor how it’s possible to accept a theory even though it hasn’t been fullyexplained. “It is no valid objection,” he said, “that science as yet throws nolight on the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who canexplain what is the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now objects tofollowing out the results consequent on this unknown element of attraction.”13[endnotes.xhtml#fn15]From this and similar statements, it’s clear that Darwin was less concerned withhow life originally appeared and more concerned with what happened after it didso. Specifically, how did the simple form of life that he believed first emergedin the world morph into the complexity and diversity that we see as life today?Darwin based his theory of evolution on his personal experience and directobservations. Many of those observations were made during a five-year journeyaboard the British research ship the HMS Beagle.14 [endnotes.xhtml#fn16] Darwinwas the designated naturalist on the ship, whose mission sounds much like themission to document new forms of life in unknown galaxies for the starshipEnterprise (of Star Trek fame). His job was to document new forms of life in theuncharted lands discovered during the Beagle’s voyage. Although Darwin’s journeylasted from 1831 to 1836, he didn’t share his theory until 23 years later. Withthe publication of Origin of Species, for the first time the essence of Darwin’stheory of evolution was available to the general public. He writes:But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individualsthus characterized will have the best chance of being preserved in the strugglefor life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produceoffspring similarly characterized. This principle of preservation, I havecalled, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection.15 [endnotes.xhtml#fn17]Today, over 150 years after Charles Darwin first published his theory, the bestscientists of the modern world, from the best universities of our time, havingaccess to the most funding in research history and using the most advancedtechnology ever available, are still struggling to prove the viability of thistheory in general, and specifically when it comes to humans.In essence, the unanswered questions are: * Does evolution alone explain the diversity that we see in the natural world today? * Does evolution apply to humans?As we’ll see in the sections that follow, new discoveries are making itnecessary to rethink the way we’ve answered both these questions in the past.EVEN DARWIN HAD HIS DOUBTSCharles Darwin didn’t know in his day what we know today about the world. Hecouldn’t have. Many fields of science that we take for granted simply didn’texist until later in the 19th century and early in the 20th century. Darwincouldn’t have known about genetics, for example. While the fact that onegeneration can inherit the traits of its parents was recognized during Darwin’stime, exactly what made the transfer possible—DNA—was not understood until afterhis death. Darwin couldn’t have known about the specialized heart cells thatgive us access to the extraordinary abilities and sensitivities that will bedescribed later in the book. And he couldn’t have known that those cells, or thecapabilities they make possible, already existed when modern humans appeared onthe scene 200,000 years ago.While Darwin couldn’t have known these things specifically, he clearly suspectedthat future discoveries would overturn at least some of his theory. He statedthis possibility in his writings. In Origin of Species, he writes: “If it couldbe demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly havebeen formed by numerous successive slight modifications”—the hallmark ofevolution—“my theory would absolutely break down.”16 [endnotes.xhtml#fn18]It’s because the conditions that Darwin himself described as the keystone to histheory have now been overturned—because in fact we do have complex organs thatdid not form through “numerous successive slight modifications”—that evolutiontheory, alone, cannot explain what we find in the real world. In other words,just as Darwin suspected would happen, his theory has broken down.In Origin of Species Darwin revealed his suspicion that evolution theory mightnot be enough to explain the complexity of life. Though the following statementmay appear a bit wordy, it’s Darwin’s language. I’m sharing it so that you’llhave a sense of his reservations—in this case, with regard to the complexfunctions of an eye.To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting thefocus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and forthe correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed bynatural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.17[endnotes.xhtml#fn19]The fact that the complexity of the eye, as well as the complexity of a numberof other organs, meets the condition that Darwin himself stated would invalidatehis theory, opens the door to the theme for Part I of this book: Evolution inand of itself is not enough to account for the extraordinary features andabilities we’ve had from the beginning. The evidence suggesting that certainphysical features—including our eyes, our advanced nervous systems, and ourbrains—were already functional when modern humans arose is casting doubt onDarwin’s theory when it comes to humankind.HUMAN EVOLUTION: SPECULATION TAUGHT AS FACTThe conventional thinking of today leaves us with the sense that Darwin’s theoryof evolution is a “done deal.” That it’s an open-and-shut case universallyaccepted by the scientific community and there is little room for doubt when itcomes to the explanation of life as we see it today. Evolution is described asfact in textbooks and classrooms. In this environment of unconditionalacceptance, scientific discoveries that cast doubt on evolution are often notreported, or worse yet, are ridiculed as superstition, religion, orpseudoscience. For this reason, people are often surprised when there is anymention of discoveries casting doubt on Darwin’s theory.A perfect example of this one-sided view is the choice by the PublicBroadcasting Service (PBS) to exclude any competing scientific theories orscientific criticism of evolution in their beautifully produced eight-hourminiseries Evolution: A Journey into Where We’re from and Where We’re Going,which aired in 2001. In the network’s own words, the goals of the program wereto “heighten public understanding of evolution and how it works, to dispelcommon misunderstandings about the process, and to illuminate why it is relevantto all of us.”18 [endnotes.xhtml#fn20] And for anyone watching the series, theydid just that, illustrating evolution solely from Darwin’s perspective, whichmany scientists see as flawed for reasons that will be described later in thischapter.A review of the PBS special by author and former White House speechwriter JoshuaGilder minced no words with regard to the way the content was produced: “Theproblem [with the PBS documentary] is that none of it is true, or is so fraughtwith inconsistencies, misinterpretation, and bad (sometimes fraudulent) data asto be worthless as science.”19 [endnotes.xhtml#fn21] Gilder based his critique,in part, upon the scientific discoveries documented by molecular biologistJonathan Wells in his book Icons of Evolution, where the PBS “proofs” of humanevolution are dismantled one by one.TAKING EVOLUTION TO THE COURTSThe evolution controversy is especially visible when it comes to state andnational laws regarding what teachers are allowed to teach in public schools. Arecent Senate bill in the state of Oklahoma is a perfect example of this. In2016, Republican senator Josh Brecheen introduced legislation to allow teachersto encourage their students to think critically about the topics that affecttheir lives and their future.Brecheen’s proposed legislation, Senate Bill 1322, states that the purpose ofthe legislation is to “create an environment within public school districts thatencourages students to explore scientific questions, learn about scientificevidence, develop critical thinking skills and respond appropriately andrespectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues. . . .Teachers shall be permitted to help students understand, analyze, critique andreview in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknessesof existing scientific theories covered in the course being taught.”20[endnotes.xhtml#fn22]While Brecheen’s bill does not mention the teaching of evolution specifically,it’s clear from his history of introducing similar legislation since hiselection in 2010, and the inclusion of the phrase scientific theories, that hisgoal was to allow teachers to share discoveries related to human origins,including discoveries that don’t support the existing story of evolution.In 2005, the legal ruling informally known as the Dover Case was about evolutionspecifically, and about the way a new, alternative theory of human origins knownas intelligent design relates to evolution. The case made worldwide headlinesbecause it was the first legal test of the new theory in a U.S. federal court.The Dover Case began when eleven families filed a lawsuit against the Dover AreaSchool District of York County, Pennsylvania, over a change in the requiredcurriculum for a ninth-grade biology class. In 2004, the school district haddirected teachers to offer discoveries supporting intelligent design in additionto the traditional teaching of Darwin’s theory of evolution. Proponents of thetheory of intelligent design, which was first used in the book Of Pandas andPeople in 1989, assert that “certain features of the universe and of livingthings are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected processsuch as natural selection.”21 [endnotes.xhtml#fn23] Both theories were beingoffered in the classroom as possible explanations for human origins. The parentswho filed the suit felt, however, that the ideas of intelligent design were toosimilar to the religious ideas of creationism, a belief that the universe andliving organisms originate from acts of divine creation, so they demanded thatthe teaching of the new theory be discontinued.The case was heard as a bench trial, rather than a trial by jury, and theoutcome immediately sparked controversy when the judge ruled that theconclusions drawn from the science-based discoveries underlying intelligentdesign were, in fact, not science at all.From the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania,with John E. Jones III (appointed by George W. Bush in 2002) as the sittingjudge at the time, the finding reads as follows:Teaching intelligent design in public school biology classes violates theEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the UnitedStates (and Article I, Section 3, of the Pennsylvania State Constitution)because intelligent design is not science and “cannot uncouple itself from itscreationist, and thus religious, antecedents.”22 [endnotes.xhtml#fn24]Immediately following the trial there were accusations of false testimony, evenperjury, when it came to the details and expert witnesses called to reveal thescientific evidence for intelligent design. Due to the nature of a bench trial,where there are no jurors, the religious and political beliefs of the judge, andthe questionable testimony, the controversy continues today.To be absolutely clear, I’m not suggesting that intelligent design is the answerto the mystery of human origins or that the trial should not have happened. WhatI am saying is that I believe we owe it to ourselves to be honest about any newdiscoveries that are made and to consider where they may lead. What is troublingabout this court ruling is what appears to be a double standard used to discountthe science that supports intelligent design. On one hand, the 150-year-oldtheory of evolution—one that has yet to be scientifically proven—is taught asfact. On the other hand, scientific evidence suggesting that the theory ofevolution is incomplete or leading us in the wrong direction is not even allowedto be mentioned in the classroom.When we’re denied the opportunity to question existing theories and present newones based upon new evidence, we also lose the power of critical thinking thatwe will need if we are to successfully confront the challenges of today’s worldand survive those of the future.It’s the authoritative nature of beautiful and convincing documentaries, such asPBS’s Evolution, and the skewed nature of the legal arguments, such as thosemade in the Dover trial, that lead many people to believe that Darwin’s theoryof evolution is an open-and-shut case for natural selection. Nothing could befurther from the truth.While many scientists have, in fact, accepted evolution as the best theory toexplain the mystery of human origins, so far their acceptance does not excludethe recognition of new theories, especially when the new theories are anchoredin good science.I’ve included the objections to evolution in Science of Self-Empowerment for tworeasons: 1. To give visibility to the fact that Darwin’s theory of evolution is not an accomplished fact when it comes to science explaining who we are 2. To give voice to a sampling of the esteemed scientists who object to evolution theory in a way that is not reflected in the mainstream media todayIn the remainder of this chapter, I’ll share some of the opinions that continueto fuel the fires of controversy regarding the theory of human evolution.ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF OBJECTIONSPassionate objections to Darwin’s theory appeared almost as soon as his book waspublished in 1859. The first was raised by Louis Agassiz, who is regarded as oneof the great scientists of the 19th century. His pioneering legacy is recognizedin the field of natural history, specifically for his work in the areas ofgeology, biology, paleontology, and glaciology. His tireless dedication to hiswork took such a priority in his overall life that he once declared to acolleague, “I cannot afford to waste my time making money.”23[endnotes.xhtml#fn25] In other words, he was so consumed with his research andmaking discoveries about the natural world that making a living was secondary.While he and Darwin were both using the same methods and looking at the sameinformation, their interpretations couldn’t have been more different.Commenting on Darwin’s theory in an 1874 publication, Agassiz wrote, “The worldhas arisen in some way or another. How it originated is the great question, andDarwin’s theory, like all other attempts, to explain the origin of life, is thusfar merely conjectural. I believe he has not even made the best conjecturepossible in the present state of our knowledge.”24 [endnotes.xhtml#fn26]Agassiz was not alone in his objections. A community of respected scientists hasobjected to Darwin’s work from the time it was first published. That communitycontinues to grow. Its roster now sounds like a who’s who of leading minds incontemporary science. Following is a sampling of the types of criticisms thathave been raised from the time Darwin introduced his theory in 1859 to thepresent.image [images/img-46-1.png]“Darwin’s theory is not inductive—not based on a series of acknowledged factspointing to a general conclusion.”25 [endnotes.xhtml#fn27]— ADAM SEDGWICK (1785–1873), CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, BRITISH GEOLOGIST AND ONE OFTHE FOUNDERS OF MODERN GEOLOGY“There are . . . absolutely no facts either in the records of geology, or in thehistory of the past, or in the experience of the present, that can be referredto as proving evolution, or the development of one species from another byselection of any kind whatever.”26 [endnotes.xhtml#fn28]— LOUIS AGASSIZ (1807–1873), HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AMERICAN GEOLOGIST“The theory suffers from grave defects, which are becoming more and moreapparent as time advances. It can no longer square with practical scientificknowledge, nor does it suffice for our theoretical grasp of the facts. . . . Noone can demonstrate that the limits of a species have ever been passed. Theseare the Rubicons which evolutionists cannot cross. . . . Darwin ransacked otherspheres of practical research work for ideas. . . . But his whole resultingscheme remains, to this day, foreign to scientifically established zoology,since actual changes of species by such means are still unknown.”27[endnotes.xhtml#fn29]— ALBERT FLEISCHMANN (1862–1942), UNIVERSITY OF ERLANGEN, GERMAN ZOOLOGIST“Evolution became in a sense a scientific religion; almost all scientists haveaccepted it and many are prepared to ‘bend’ their observations to fit withit.”28 [endnotes.xhtml#fn30]— H. S. LIPSON (1910–1991), UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY, BRITISH PHYSICIST“Evolution is the backbone of biology and biology is thus in the peculiarposition of being a science founded on unproven theory. Is it then a science ora faith? Belief in the theory of evolution is thus exactly parallel to belief inspecial creation. Both are concepts which the believers know to be true, butneither, up to the present, has been capable of proof.”29 [endnotes.xhtml#fn31]— LEONARD HARRISON MATTHEWS (1901–1986), CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, BRITISH ZOOLOGIST“The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way is comparablewith the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble aBoeing 747 from the materials therein. I am at a loss to understand biologists’widespread compulsion to deny what seems to me to be obvious.”30[endnotes.xhtml#fn32]— SIR FRED HOYLE (1915–2001), CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, BRITISH ASTRONOMER; FORMEDTHE THEORY OF STELLAR NUCLEOSYNTHESIS“Ultimately the Darwinian theory of evolution is no more or less than the greatcosmogenic myth of the twentieth century. The truth is that despite the prestigeof evolutionary theory and the tremendous intellectual effort directed towardsreducing living systems to the confines of Darwinian thought, nature refuses tobe imprisoned. In the final analysis we still know very little about how newforms of life arise. The ‘mystery of mysteries’—the origin of new beings onearth—is still largely as enigmatic as when Darwin set sail on the Beagle.”31[endnotes.xhtml#fn33]— MICHAEL DENTON (1943–), BRITISH BIOCHEMIST, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR SCIENCEAND CULTURE“But how do you get from nothing to such an elaborate something if evolutionmust proceed through a long sequence of intermediate stages, each favored bynatural selection? You can’t fly with 2 percent of a wing or gain muchprotection from an iota’s similarity with a potentially concealing piece ofvegetation. How, in other words, can natural selection explain the incipientstages of structures that can only be used [as we now observe them] in much moreelaborated form?”32 [endnotes.xhtml#fn34]— STEPHEN JAY GOULD (1941–2002), HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AMERICAN PALEONTOLOGIST ANDEVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST“The point, however, is that the doctrine of evolution has swept the world, noton the strength of its scientific merits, but precisely in its capacity as aGnostic myth. It affirms, in effect, that living beings create themselves, whichis, in essence, a metaphysical claim. . . . Thus, in the final analysis,evolutionism is in truth a metaphysical doctrine decked out in scientificgarb.”33 [endnotes.xhtml#fn35]— WOLFGANG SMITH (1930–), AMERICAN MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICISTimage [images/img-49-1.png]The preceding statements offer insights rarely seen by the public, and certainlynot shared in typical school classrooms, when it comes to accepting Darwin’stheory. In 2001, during the same period of time that PBS was airing theEvolution miniseries, a diverse group of international scientists signed adeclaration that they posted online to let the world know that, for them, themystery of our origins was not yet solved. As of July 2015 the declaration hadbeen signed by 1,371 esteemed scientists from around the world and the list ofsignatories continues to grow.The petition itself is brief and simply reads:We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and naturalselection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of theevidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.34 [endnotes.xhtml#fn36]Clearly, the jury is still out on the viability of Darwin’s theory of evolutionwhen it comes to solving the mystery of human beginnings. It’s obvious fromobjections such as the ones listed, and more, that criticism of evolutioncontinues with passion and vigorous debate. And while Darwin’s ideas are acentury and a half old, they’re still among the most emotionally charged issuesof our time. My sense is that the reason for the controversy is twofold: first,the theory has deep moral, social, and religious implications; second, evolutionis usually presented as scientific fact even though conflicting issues have yetto be resolved.HONORING CHARLES DARWINNow that we have viewed some of the objections to Darwin’s theory of evolution,I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify my personal view as a geologist,researcher, and author when it comes to Charles Darwin himself and his ideas ofevolution.I’ll begin by stating that I have tremendous respect for Charles Darwin, both asa man and as a scientist, for what he accomplished in his day. He lived in asociety that was very different from our 21st-century world. It took tremendouscourage for him to offer what he did, in the way that he did it, during his timein history. The Catholic Church played a powerful and dominant role in19th-century England, and Darwin knew that his theory would pose a direct threatto the religious doctrine of the Church. It was precisely because of thisawareness that he waited over twenty years after his voyage on the HMS Beagleended in 1836 to publish his book. In a letter he wrote to botanist Asa Gray in1860, he stated his concern, saying that he “had no intention to writeatheistically.”35 [endnotes.xhtml#fn37]Darwin lived to see his fears of such criticism justified as Cardinal HenryEdward Manning, England’s highest-ranking Catholic official when Origin ofSpecies was published, attacked the theory of evolution as a “brutalphilosophy,” stating that it implied “the ape is our Adam.”36[endnotes.xhtml#fn38] In spite of such criticism, at the time of his death in1862, Darwin was considered to be the greatest scientist of his era.I’d also like to acknowledge that much of the controversy that Darwin’s theoryhas caused both in his time and today is due to 1) a misunderstanding of what heactually said and 2) the desire of universities, college professors, thescientific community at large, and politicians to hold his work sacred andinfallible. In other words, institutions and the people who support them haveattempted to make Darwin’s work into something he himself never intended it tobe. They want to use his theory for purposes he never foresaw or intended.Darwin was a geologist and, by all accounts, a good geologist. He was fair andhonest when he wrote about what he observed, as well as about what he believedhis observations were telling him. His work was well thought out andmeticulously documented, and his methods followed the accepted guidelines of theperiod. Where I believe Darwin’s process was flawed is in regard to what he didafter he published Origin of Species. Because his theory of evolution seemed tofit what he saw happening for one form of life in one place in theworld—specifically, for the finches of the Galapagos Islands—he tried togeneralize the theory to apply to all life everywhere, including humankind. Thisleap is where Darwin’s theory of evolution appears to break down.While we still don’t know precisely what did happen when our modern humanancestors appeared 200,000 years ago, the best evidence we’ve obtained from thefossil record does not support evolution as the explanation for how they came tobe as they were. I’m mentioning this point now because the thinking that isperpetuated by the mainstream media and many academic institutions that have avested interest in keeping the story of evolution alive is that the controversyis over.A THEORY IN NEED OF PROOFImmediately following Charles Darwin’s 1859 release of Origin of Species, thewidespread acceptance of his theory led to a search for the physical evidence tosupport it: the “missing links” between species that were believed to exist inthe fossil record. If scientists could find these clues, the logic goes, thenthey would be able to reconstruct our ancient family tree of development. Justthe way we can document our individual family lineage in reverse, going from ourparents to our grandparents, and then to our great-grandparents, and so on, theyassumed one day it would be possible to create a family tree of all ourcollective ancestors.The current thinking about our human evolutionary tree is shown in Figure 1.1.In this image, modern humans are represented by Homo sapiens, the bold dot inthe upper left portion of the chart. The lines forming the branches that connectus with the other skulls lower on the tree represent the various paths ofdevelopment—evolutionary paths—scientists believe have led from early primatesto us today.image [images/img-53-1.png]Figure 1.1. An example of the traditional human family tree of evolution. Theproblem with the thinking represented by this tree is that physical evidenceconfirming a connection between the fossils has yet to be discovered. This lackof evidence is the reason the lines that form the tree are labeled “inferred”relationships.A close look at the illustration in Figure 1.1, however, reveals that the linksbetween the fossils are shown as dashed lines rather than solid ones. This meansthat the lines represent speculative or inferred connections rather than provenones. While the links are believed to exist, after 150 years of searching forthe evidence to support them, they have yet to be proven.Key 8: While the connections between ancient primates and modern humans on theevolutionary family tree are believed to exist, they have never been proven asfact—they are inferred and speculative connections only, at this point in time.In other words, the physical evidence that confirms the evolutionary links thatinfluence aspects of our lives ranging from health care to the moraljustification of hate crimes, suicide, assisted suicide, and the death penaltyas well as the criteria for our self-image and intimate relationships has yet tobe discovered!From the time evolution theory was introduced in 1859 to the date of thiswriting, to the best of this author’s knowledge no clear evidence of atransitional species leading to us—that is, fossils that reflect an evolutionaryjourney from primitive to more human-like beings—has been discovered! Thomas H.Morgan, the winner of the 1933 Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine, left nodoubt of this in the minds of readers of his book Evolution and Adaptation. Asmodern science applies what Morgan says are the “most rigid . . . tests used todistinguish wild species,” he states, “Within the period of human history we donot know of a single instance of the transformation of one species intoanother.”37 [endnotes.xhtml#fn39]In the face of impassioned scientific debates, and with the “futuristic”technology that’s now unlocking life’s deepest mysteries, the stark fact ofMorgan’s observation remains a warning against wholeheartedly embracing thetheory of human evolution. Even so, the theory continues to be taught in publicclassrooms as if it’s an undisputed fact!In Origin of Species, Darwin acknowledged the irony in the lack of physicalevidence to support his theory. He also noted that the reason for the lack ofphysical evidence could possibly be explained in one of two ways: Either thegeologists were interpreting the history of the earth incorrectly, or he himselfhad incorrectly interpreted the observations that became the foundation of histheory.In Darwin’s own words:Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of thegradation and mutation of the forms of life? We meet with no such evidence, andthis is the most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urgedagainst my theory.38 [endnotes.xhtml#fn40]It’s against the backdrop of these ideas and criticisms that an astoundingdiscovery in the late 20th century gave scientists the opportunity to put someof the strongest-held arguments for evolution to the test. If human evolutionhas in fact occurred, as Darwin’s theory hypothesizes, then the best way toprove the theory would be to compare us to our ancestors at the deepest level ofour cells. To do so, scientists would need to sample the DNA of our earlyancestors and compare it to the DNA of our bodies today, which is a problembecause modern humans have already been on earth for 200,000 years. Because DNAis fragile, it doesn’t last that long.Is it possible that DNA from ancient primate life could still exist today? Andif it were to exist, could we test the recovered DNA the way we routinely testour DNA today? Although these questions sound as if they could have come fromthe plot of Jurassic Park, a movie depicting ancient dinosaurs being resurrectedthrough DNA in the present day, the answer to these questions came to light inthe form of a one-of-a-kind discovery in 1987. The revelations of the discoveryhave left more questions unanswered, created even deeper mysteries, and openedthe door to a possibility that has been forbidden territory in traditionalscience."},{"pageContent":"chapter two [contents.xhtml#toc5]image [images/img-57-1.png]HUMAN BY DESIGN [contents.xhtml#toc5]The Mystery of Fused DNA [contents.xhtml#toc5]“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, themore we feel that it is too complex to have evolved anywhere.”— HAROLD UREY (1893–1981), NOBEL PRIZE–WINNING CHEMISTOn Saturday, February 28, 1953, two men walked into the Eagle pub inCambridgeshire, England, and announced a discovery that would forever change theworld and the way we think of ourselves. At noon that day, Cambridge Universityscientists James Watson and Francis Crick announced to their colleagues who werehaving lunch at the pub, “We have discovered the secret of life!”1[endnotes.xhtml#fn41] Watson and Crick had just made their breakthroughdiscovery of the double helix pattern of the DNA molecule—nature’s code forlife.DNA is held within each cell of our body in threadlike structures that arecalled chromosomes. As humans, we have 23 pairs of chromosomes in our cells.Each chromosome, in turn, is made of smaller, more precise regions of DNA calledgenes. It’s the codes contained within the genes and chromosomes that determineeverything about the function of our bodies, including the regulation ofhormones and blood chemistry, how fast and to what size our bones grow, the sizeof our brains, the kind of eyes we have, and how long we live—even automaticfunctions such as breathing, digestion, metabolism, and body temperature. With adiscovery of this magnitude, it would seem that the greatest mysteries of ourexistence would be solved. Many have been. However, due to the deeper insightsthat DNA discoveries have made possible, scientists now face a quandary when itcomes to interpreting where the new information about our genetic code fits intothe accepted human story.RETRIEVING DNA FROM A NEANDERTHAL BABYIn 1987, a paradigm-shattering discovery was made in the Caucasus region ofRussia, near the border between Europe and Asia. Buried deep in the earth, in aplace called Mezmaiskaya Cave, scientists discovered the remains of aNeanderthal infant—a baby girl that lived about 30,000 years ago! For reference,the last ice age ended about 20,000 years ago, meaning that this baby was aliveduring the ice age. Her remains were in an extremely rare state of preservation,and scientists were able to determine her age as somewhere between that of anunborn seven-month fetus and a two-month-old infant.William Goodwin, Ph.D., from the University of Glasgow commented on theexceptional discovery. “It is something of a mystery how this child’s remainswere so perfectly preserved. . . . Normally you only get material with thisdegree of preservation in material from permafrost areas.”2[endnotes.xhtml#fn42]I’m sharing many details here because this landmark discovery was the turningpoint when it comes to answering the question of where humans fit on theevolutionary family tree.Using forensic techniques, like the futuristic technology that’s depicted in theTV series CSI, scientists were able to extract mitochondrial DNA from one of thebaby’s ribs for analysis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a special form of DNAthat’s located within the energy centers (mitochondria) inside each of ourcells, rather than in the chromosomes, where most of our DNA is found. Thereason mtDNA is key when it comes to the question of human evolution is that weinherit it only from our mothers. It’s passed from the egg of a mother to bothher sons and her daughters, and this typically happens without any of themutations that can lead to new features in children. This means that themitochondrial DNA lines in our bodies today are the direct descendants, andexact matches, of the mitochondrial DNA of the woman who began our particularlineage long ago. Because of this unique quality, mtDNA is used to study howpeople and populations in one place relate to those in other places. It’s theuniqueness of this form of DNA that set the stage for the bombshell revealed bythe Neanderthal infant.NOW WE KNOW WHO WE’RE NOTUsing the most advanced techniques, with results that are accepted in thehighest courts of law, Russian and Swedish scientists tested the Neanderthalinfant’s DNA to see how similar hers was to that of modern-day humans. In otherwords, the scientists wanted to know if the Neanderthal girl was actually one ofour ancestors, as the evolutionary family tree leads us to believe. The resultsof the first studies were published in obscure scientific journals, whichconcluded, according to the Smithsonian Institution, that “the Neanderthal mtDNAsequences were substantially different from human mtDNA.”3 [endnotes.xhtml#fn43]Although this single statement sounds relatively benign, it’s the equivalent ofan earthquake with the epicenter right at the root of the human evolutionarytree. Few mainstream news sources shared the discovery, however, and those thatdid offered the technical details without simplifying them for lay readers orinterpreting their significance.All of that changed, however, in the year 2000. It was then that researchers atthe University of Glasgow Human Identification Centre published the results oftheir own investigation comparing Neanderthal DNA to that of modern humans. Theresults of their study were shared in a way that made sense even to the mostnonscientific reader. And the meaning of what they found could not be dismissed.The conclusion of their report was shared in the peer-reviewed journal Natureand directly stated that modern humans “were not, in fact, descended fromNeanderthals.”4 [endnotes.xhtml#fn44]Now there could be no turning back. While scientists had originally believedthat the mtDNA of the Neanderthal infant would solve the mystery of ourancestry, it actually did just the opposite.Key 9: The discovery of an extraordinarily well-preserved female Neanderthalinfant—dating back 30,000 years—and the comparison of her mitochondrial DNA toours, tells us definitively that the earliest modern humans were not thedescendants of ancient Neanderthals.NOT YOUR AVERAGE CAVEMANIf we’re not descendants of Neanderthals, then who are our ancestors? Where dowe fit on the tree of evolution—do we even belong in Darwin’s evolutionaryfamily? The comparison of DNA from Neanderthals and other primate fossils hasshed new light on this question. In doing so, however, it’s also forcedscientists to ponder a new possibility when it comes to unraveling the mysteryof our origins.When I was in school during the 1960s and 1970s, learning about Neanderthals andother prehuman beings such as the Australopithecus (the famous Lucy) and theHomo habilis (the handy man), we were taught that there was another member ofthe evolutionary family tree who was a close ancestor as well. In those days,the name used for these distant relatives was the Cro-Magnon. Today, however,that term is no longer used. Paleoanthropologists have replaced it with anotherthat makes more sense, and the reason is self-explanatory. The new name used toidentify the beings once known as Cro-Magnons is anatomically modern humans, orAMHs.Scientists generally agree that AMHs first appear in the fossil recordapproximately 200,000 years ago and mark the beginning of the subspecies Homosapiens sapiens—the term used to describe the people living on earth today.5[endnotes.xhtml#fn45] While fossils of bones themselves are more resistant tothe elements and can last for millions of years, the DNA found inside bones—inthe bone marrow—is much more fragile and typically exists only in relativelyrecent remains. So although AMHs appeared on earth 200,000 years ago, the oldestDNA discovered from them so far is from a man who lived in Siberia about 45,000years ago.6 [endnotes.xhtml#fn46]In 2003, further advances in genetic technology allowed for the comparison ofthe earliest anatomically modern human bodies with four newly discoveredNeanderthal bodies. A team of European scientists compared the DNA from twoAMHs, one that was 23,000 years old and another that was 25,000 years old, withDNA from the remains of the Neanderthals, who were variously dated as livingbetween 29,000 and 42,000 years ago. An article on the findings published inNational Geographic News, quotes one of the co-authors as saying, “Our resultsadd to the evidence collected previously in different fields, making thehypothesis of a ‘Neanderthal heritage’ very unlikely.”7 [endnotes.xhtml#fn47]Once again the Neanderthals, often portrayed as primitive cavemen in movies andcartoons, were eliminated as possible ancestors of early modern humans.Now that we know who our ancestors were not, the focus of paleoanthropology hasshifted to discovering who they were. The DNA studies have narrowed the broadfield down to one particular candidate. And it’s not the candidate supporters ofDarwin’s theory expected.THEY ARE USScientists now believe that the AMHs are us, and we are they. Any differencesbetween contemporary bodies and those of the AMHs of the past are so slight thatthey don’t justify a separate grouping. In other words, although ancient humansdidn’t necessarily behave like we do, they looked like us, functioned like us,and appear to have had all of the “wiring” in their nervous systems that we havetoday.Stated another way, we still look and function as they did 2,000 centuries ago,despite our incredible technological achievements. A 2008 study of AMH remains(still called Cro-Magnon at the time), performed by collaborating geneticistsfrom the universities of Ferrara and Florence in Italy, tells us that thesesimilarities are more than superficial. Researchers report, “A Cro-Magnoidindividual who lived in Southern Italy 28,000 years ago was a modern European,genetically as well as anatomically.”8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn48]It’s the fact that members of our species, Homo sapiens, haven’t changed sinceour earliest ancestors first appear in the fossil record that poses a problemfor the traditional story of evolution, which is based upon slow changes overlong periods of time. Discoveries that could not have been made in Darwin’s timehave shed new light on this lingering mystery.THE DNA THAT MAKES US DIFFERENTThe set of all human DNA, the human genome, was the first DNA sequence of anyvertebrate to be entirely mapped. The international effort that made thismapping possible—the Human Genome Project (HGP)—was the result of the largestcooperative biology project in the history of the world.9 [endnotes.xhtml#fn49]In June 2000, U.K. prime minister Tony Blair and U.S. president Bill Clintonjointly revealed that the first draft of the human code of life had beensuccessfully completed. In doing so, they announced to the world that thisunprecedented act of cooperation had opened a new era of lifesaving geneticmedicine, and the global industry and economic boom that would follow.After the success of the HGP, the same techniques used to map human DNA werethen applied to other living things. For the first time, scientists could gobeyond educated guesses about our genetic relationships and actually compare ourlife’s code to that of any other form of life. The results were nothing short ofmind-boggling. While scientists have long known that chimpanzees, for example,are our nearest relatives, for the first time DNA maps allowed them to see justhow close that relationship really is.Genetic mapping revealed that there is only a 1.5 percent difference thatseparates us from chimpanzees, or conversely stated, we share over 98 percent ofthe same DNA.10 [endnotes.xhtml#fn50] When the mapping methods were appliedbeyond primates, the results were equally astounding. For instance, we share 60percent of our DNA with a fruit fly, 80 percent with a cow, and 90 percent witha common house cat. We obviously don’t look or act like a fly, a cow, or a cat.The big question that comes from such revelations is this: If we have so much incommon with other creatures genetically, then why are we so different from them?The answer to this question goes back to an unexpected discovery made during theHGP: that a single gene can be activated in different ways, and to differentdegrees, to do different things. What this tells us is that it’s not so muchabout what genes we have in common with chimps, cows, flies, and cats. It’s moreabout how those genes are activated—or expressed. A gene called FOXP2, nowunderstood to be directly linked to our ability to form complex speech, is aperfect example of what I mean here.FOXP2 is shorthand for Forkhead Box Protein P2, a protein that’s involved in thehuman ability for language. Located on chromosome 7 (precisely at location7q31), the FOXP2 protein is coded from a gene that has the same name, FOXP2, andis present in both humans and chimpanzees.11 [endnotes.xhtml#fn51],12[endnotes.xhtml#fn52] It’s obvious, however, that chimpanzees can’t sing the LedZeppelin song “Stairway to Heaven” the way a person can! This fact tells us thatthere is something more than the gene itself that’s involved here. There’ssomething in the way the gene expresses itself that gives us the ability toconsistently create the sounds of language. In 2009, a study published in thejournal Nature gives us a clue as to what that “something” is.Scientists knew from earlier research that humans and chimpanzees both possessthe FOXP2 gene. They’d also determined that the human version of the gene hadchanged (mutated) at some point in the past, and that the change happenedquickly—not slowly and gradually, as the theory of evolution would suggest. Nowresearchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA had determined thatthis change happened precisely at a critical moment in the unfolding of thehuman story. According to these scientists, the mutation happened “rapidlyaround the same time that language emerged in humans.”13 [endnotes.xhtml#fn53]This was a pivotal discovery because for the first time a specific set ofmutations in FOXP2 was scientifically linked to our capacity to create complexlanguage.Additional studies took this research even further and determined when thisparticular change had happened. According to Wolfgang Enard of the Max PlanckInstitute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the mutations in FOXP2 that make ourcomplex language possible “happened in the same time frame when modern humansevolved.”14 [endnotes.xhtml#fn54] A BBC News World Edition report clarifies thisrelationship, stating that our capacity for language happened when “changes totwo single letters of the DNA code [the representations for the building blocksof amino acids] arose in the last 200,000 years of human evolution.”15[endnotes.xhtml#fn55]The speed and precision of the mutations in FOXP2, occurring in just the righttwo places in the DNA code, are further examples of the kind of change that doesnot lend itself to the theory of evolution—at least not as we understand thetheory today. Why did the changes happen in the way they did? What could havecaused just the right shift of DNA letters, at just the right place, within justthe right chromosome, to give us the extraordinary ability to share our feelingsover a candlelight dinner for two, chant wildly when our team wins the SuperBowl or the World Cup, and whisper into a lover’s ear? The best science of themodern world has now given us the answer. The question is, are we willing toaccept what the DNA reveals?FOUND: OUR “MISSING” DNA!Because humans are classified as the most complex and advanced member of theprimate family, it was reasonable for scientists to expect that we would havemore chromosomes than our less complex relatives. This is where an unexpectedtwist in our DNA story begins. Our nearest primate relatives, the chimpanzees,have more chromosomes than we do, with a total of 48 in their overall genome.Ironically, humans have only 46. In other words, it looks like we’re missing twochromosomes when we’re compared to chimps. It’s only been recently, usingadvanced methods of DNA sequencing, that the mystery of “where they went”appears to have been solved. In doing so, however, we once again find ourselvesat the threshold of a deeper mystery that holds startling implications!A closer look at our genetic map shows that our “missing” DNA isn’t reallymissing at all. It’s been with us all along; only it’s been modified andarranged in a way that wasn’t obvious in the past. New research reveals that thesecond largest chromosome in the human body, forming 8 percent of the total DNAin cells, human chromosome 2 (HC2), actually contains the smaller “missing”chromosomes found in the chimp genome.16 [endnotes.xhtml#fn56] In other words,at some point in the past, for reasons that remain controversial, two separatechimp chromosomes got combined into a single larger chromosome that is ourchromosome 2.It’s the way these smaller chromosomes combined that may solve the mystery ofmutations such as those in FOXP2, and ultimately, the mystery of human origins.While scientists acknowledge that the mutations definitely occurred in FOXP2 andthat they happened within the time frame that correlates with the rise ofanatomically modern humans, they can’t really tell us what caused the change.But they can tell with chromosome 2. And it’s this difference that setschromosome 2 apart.New technology has revealed precisely what happened to create HC2. I’ll sharethe discovery in two ways with you: first in the scientists’ own technicallanguage from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences to reveal thediscovery itself, and then with a simpler description in lay language toillustrate why this discovery is important to our discussion. * The technical explanation. “We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2.”17 [endnotes.xhtml#fn57] * The simplified explanation. It appears that long ago two separate chromosomes from chimpanzees (chimp chromosomes 2A and 2B) merged or fused into the single, larger human chromosome 2—which is one of the key chromosomes that give us our humanness.Many of the characteristics that make us uniquely human arise from the DNAfusion that resulted in human chromosome 2. HC2-linked traits include qualitiessuch as our intellect, the growth and development of our brains in general, andspecifically the largest part of our brain, the cortex, which is associated withthe way we think and act and our capacity for emotion.18 [endnotes.xhtml#fn58]HC2 contains over 1,400 genes that continue to be mapped and explored today.While a full list, in technical nomenclature, is available through the referenceI’m citing in the endnotes, in the following chart I’ll share a few simplifiedexamples of these genes to give you a sense of the crucial roles they play inour humanness.19 [endnotes.xhtml#fn59]Gene Influence Gene TBR1 Key in brain development, particularly the developmentof the cortex (the largest part of the human brain, which is associated with theway we think and act), our capacity for emotion, empathy, and compassion, andneuron functions (the so-called hardwiring that carries signals within thebrain, and throughout the body, to process information) Gene SATB2 Key in thedevelopment of the midbrain and forebrain Gene BMPR2 Key in osteogenesis (bonetissue formation) as well as cell growth throughout the body Gene MSH2 Known asa tumor suppressor or “caretaker” gene Gene SSB Key in the fetal development oforgans that include the heart, brain, eye, kidney, liver, lung, skeleton,spleen, among othersFrom this small sampling, it’s clear that human chromosome 2 plays a significantrole in contributing to who, and what, we are. This is especially apparent forthe genes TBR1 and SATB2, located on HC2, and the role they play in thedevelopment and function of our advanced brain and our extraordinary capacityfor emotion. In light of the significance of HC2, the question of how it cameinto existence becomes more important than ever.Unlike the previous example of the FOXP2 gene, where changes simply show up in agenome comparison—meaning at one point in time they don’t exist in the geneticrecord of fossils, and at another point in time they do—human chromosome 2 haspreserved a record of how it came to exist. It’s what this forensic evidence maytruly reveal to us that has opened the door to so much speculation. This iswhere the story of our past takes an unexpected turn, with deeper implicationsthat make our origins begin to sound like the theme of a really goodscience-fiction novel. You see, the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences study states that although this kind of fusion is known to happenoccasionally, it’s rare.What accompanied the fusion itself opens the door to our new human story.In the language of the researchers describing this discovery, the fusion waseither “accompanied or followed by inactivation or elimination of one of theancestral centromeres, as well as by events which stabilize the fusion point.”20[endnotes.xhtml#fn60] While this language is admittedly complex, the message isclear and simple. The study is telling us that during the fusion, or immediatelyafterward, the overlapping functions from what were originally two separatechromosomes were either adjusted, turned off, or removed altogether to make thenew single chromosome more efficient.This fact strongly implies intentionality. And as we’ve discovered previously,that intentionality led to humanity’s possession of many of the extraordinaryfunctions that are found in no other form of life on earth.Key 10: Human chromosome 2, the second-largest chromosome in the human body, isthe result of an ancient DNA fusion that cannot be explained by the theory ofevolution as we understand it today.Two Questions: Why and How?So now that we know where the missing DNA is located, and how two ancientprimate chromosomes were fused into the new larger human chromosome 2, twoquestions naturally arise: 1. Why did this ancient fusion of DNA happen? 2. How were the overlapping (redundant) parts of the fusion “switched off” or removed altogether?The answer to question 1 is that scientists simply don’t know. As of thiswriting, scientists cannot say with absolute certainty why primate DNA gotmerged in the way that it did, yielding AMHs. While there is certainly noshortage of theories and speculation attempting to explain the mystery, 25 yearsafter this finding was made, the truth is that, at present, there still is noscientific consensus for what could have triggered this miraculous-soundingevent.One thing appears to be certain, however: The DNA that makes us who we are, andwhat we are, is not the result of the process of evolution that Charles Darwindescribed. My sense is that if we can answer the second question—how the fusionoccurred—what we discover will ultimately help us answer the question of why,and much more. When we can answer definitively how the ancient genetic fusionhappened and how specific pieces of the fusion were modified so precisely and soquickly 200,000 years ago, the solution to these mysteries will lead us directlyto an explanation for why such an extraordinary event took place.As you may imagine, the discovery of an ancient and complex DNA fusion isinterpreted by scientists in different ways. And the differing interpretationshave triggered a landslide of controversy. Even after the publication of thearticle in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences describedpreviously, staunch supporters of the evolutionary theory for humans have arguedthat there are other explanations for the DNA fusion. One theory, for example,proposes that humans and apes, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, all share acommon ancestor and that a “split” separated us from them long ago.If this is true, the chromosome 2 fusion happened to us, and only us, and ithappened after we had already split from the other primates. They kept their 48chromosomes and we experienced the fusion that gives us our 46.This idea makes little sense to me, as it suggests that the DNA that gives usour uniqueness didn’t appear until after the uniqueness that caused the splithad already happened!I’m not alone in my thinking, and, to date, evolutionary explanations have notreceived popular support. I’m sharing an example with you here to illustrate howa radical discovery that attempts to solve one mystery, such as the DNA fusionin chromosome 2, can create even more mysteries as its meaning is digested.IRREDUCIBLE COMPLEXITYThere is an additional consideration to be made when it comes to the way wethink of evolution and the role it may have played in our lives. And while youprobably won’t see this idea described in classrooms and textbooks (yet), Ithink it’s important to share it here for completeness. The idea is irreduciblecomplexity. What this means is much simpler than its name sounds.I mentioned previously that we have access to knowledge in our era about thingsthat Darwin couldn’t have possibly known. It’s this fact that makes irreduciblecomplexity worth exploring today. For example, Darwin couldn’t have known thateven the simplest bacteria, the single-celled E. coli, needs 2,000 differentproteins to exist; and he couldn’t have known that each of those 2,000 proteinshas an average of 300 amino acids that make it what it is. The key here is thatneither Darwin nor any scientist of the late 1800s or early 1900s could haveknown just how complex living beings really are. Until recently, nobody could.Irreducible complexity essentially means that if any portion of a system stopsworking, the entire system fails. A common mousetrap is often used to illustratethis point. When all of the parts of a mousetrap are in place, it does what itwas made to do—what it was designed to do: It trips a lever that traps the mousethat has taken the cheese or peanut butter bait, and ends the life of the mouse.The trap is a system of parts, with each part performing a specific task toaccomplish the ultimate goal. For example, there’s the lever that holds the baitand there’s the powerful spring that comes down with such lethal force when thebait is disturbed that the mouse doesn’t even know what hit it. While the trapsounds like a simple gadget, the key is this: If even one part of the device ismissing, the trap simply won’t work. Without the spring, the lever will neversnap. Without the lever, the spring will have nothing to trigger. Because allthe pieces of the trap are needed for the system to work, it’s fair to say thatwe can’t streamline the mousetrap in any way. We can’t reduce it to a simplersystem and still have the system be functional. It is irreducibly complex.If we apply this idea to the human body, we see a similar result.WE ARE LIVING EXAMPLES OF IRREDUCIBLE COMPLEXITYWe all know that when we scrape a knee, the site of the injury will generallybleed briefly and then the bleeding stops. The reason it stops is that bloodclots at the site of the scrape. We’re so accustomed to seeing this process thatit’s easy to take the complexity of our blood clotting for granted. We justassume that it’s going to happen. And the fact that it does is a perfect exampleof irreducible complexity. When we scratch, cut, or break our skin, 20 separateproteins must be already in place and ready to act for our blood to clot and thebleeding to stop.This fact is key to our discussion of irreducible complexity for one importantreason: If even one of the 20 proteins needed for clotting is missing, thebleeding will continue. Whether we wait 10 minutes or 10 hours, the result willbe the same. Our blood can only coagulate when all the proteins that makeclotting possible are in place.Our blood’s ability to clot is an example of a life function that could not havedeveloped through evolution. To do so, 20 proteins would have already needed tobe formed and in the same place before the blood that gives our bodies lifecould form. If these components had not already been in place, our ancestorswould have bled to death with the first minor injuries they sustained—meaning wemight not be here, because they might have died without producing offspring. Andthis is only one example.Here’s another. The little waving arms (cilia) that allow cells, including spermcells, to travel in fluid have more than 40 moving parts that must all bepresent for the cilia to wave. If any part is missing, the cells can’t move. Ifancient sperm cells from a male of our species had not been immediatelyempowered to “swim” toward the egg of a female, reproduction could not haveoccurred.And there’s more.The human cell has been called the single most complex piece of machinery everknown to exist. Until the mid-20th century or so, cells were essentially thoughtof as tiny bags of salt water holding dissolved elements. We now know thatnothing could be further from the truth. In fact, if we could enlarge a singlecell to the size of a city, we would discover that the cell is more complex thanjust the infrastructure that keeps it going. A sample of a cell’s importantstructures includes: * Ribosomes that manufacture proteins. * Endoplasmic reticulum that makes and transports important chemicals used by the cell. * A nucleus that carries instructions for the cell on how to function. * Microtubules that allow the cell to move and change shape. * Cilia (little waving arms) that allow some cells to move in fluid. * Mitochondria that generate energy for the cell. * A membrane that communicates with the environment and determines what gets into and leaves the cell.This is just a sampling of the myriad processes that are happening at any givenmoment in each of the approximately 50 trillion cells of the human body. As wediscover what each process does, it becomes obvious that all this cellularmachinery had to be already created, and in place, for our earliest cells to dowhat they do. From clotting blood to swimming cilia, the body holds manyexamples of irreducible complexity.To even the most skeptical scientist, it’s obvious that the DNA of life is basedupon structure, order, and the sharing of information that tells our cells whatto do and when to do it. In nature, this kind of order is often seen as a signof intelligence.Key 11: The 20 proteins that make the clotting of blood possible and the 40-pluscomponents of the cilia (wiggly tails) that allow cells to move through a fluidare just two examples of functions that could not develop gradually over a longperiod of time as evolution suggests. In both examples, if even one protein orcomponent part is missing, the function of the cells is lost.In candid interviews late in his life, Albert Einstein shared his belief that anunderlying order of information exists in the universe, as well as his sense ofwhere that order comes from. During one of those conversations, he confided, “Isee a pattern but my imagination cannot picture the maker of the pattern. We alldance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper.”21[endnotes.xhtml#fn61] In our search for human origins, the very presence of theorder and intentionality we see in our DNA is a sign that Einstein’s invisiblepiper exists.WE’RE OVER-ENDOWED!There is an additional theme of evolution theory that I have intentionallywaited until now to mention. It’s a corollary to Darwin’s theory, first statedby a colleague and fellow supporter of Darwin, British naturalist Alfred RusselWallace. Through his work, Wallace defined the evolutionary principle that pavesthe way for the rest of this book. Building upon Darwin’s original work, Wallacemade an extraordinary observation when it comes to the development of newfeatures in a species. I’ll share Wallace’s corollary, stated in his own words,and then apply his statement to what we now know about our own development.In the final chapter of his book Contributions to the Theory of NaturalSelection, published in 1870, Wallace leaves no doubt with his readers aboutwhat he’s saying: “Natural Selection would only have endowed savage man with abrain a little superior to that of an ape, whereas he actually possesses onevery little inferior to that of a philosopher.”22 [endnotes.xhtml#fn62] In thissomewhat complex passage, Wallace is stating that nature only gives us what weneed, when we need it, and does so through evolution, which Darwin defined as aslow and gradual process. In other words, the theory says that we have abilitiessuch as standing upright, advanced peripheral vision, and the ability to shareour emotions through smiles, frowns, and other facial expressions because weneeded them at some point in the past.Herein lies the problem. We’re all over-endowed! And it appears that we havebeen since the dawn of our existence.Key 12: Humans appeared on earth with the same advanced brains and nervoussystems we have today and with the ability to self-regulate vital functionsalready developed, contradicting the corollary to evolution theory that naturedoesn’t “over-endow” with such features until they are needed.THE NEW HUMAN STORYFollowing 150 years of the best human minds applying themselves under theauspices of the world’s most respected universities, being funded withtremendous sums of money, and using the most sophisticated technology availableto solve the mystery of our origins, if we were on the right track, it wouldseem that we’d be farther along than we are today. In light of the failure ofDarwin’s theory to explain our existence, and in consideration of the newevidence that I’ve presented, it’s reasonable to ask the question that’s becomethe big pink elephant in the room: What if modern science is on the wrong track?What if we’re trying to prove the wrong theory and writing the wrong humanstory? The answer to this question is the reason I’ve written this book. Ifwe’re on the wrong track, it may help to explain why so many of the solutionsapplied to the world’s problems aren’t working. This would mean that ourthinking and the “solutions” our approaches have produced are based on somethingthat’s not true!Why not allow the evidence to lead us to the story of our past, rather thantrying to force the evidence into a template that was formed over a century anda half ago? If we’re serious about solving the deepest mystery of our existence,it would make sense for us to open our minds and allow for anotherinterpretation of the data we’ve collected during a century and a half of study.What if there is no evolutionary path leading to modern humans? What if thepieces of the genetic puzzle that makes us who we are were suddenly locked intoplace all at once rather than accumulating gradually over time? What would sucha story look like? The data from studies of human chromosome 2 and other DNAstudies, the lack of fossil evidence documenting the transition from one hominidspecies to another, and the lack of common DNA between humans and less advancedprimates all suggest that we may not belong on the same tree with the earlyhominids commonly shown in the textbooks. In fact, they suggest that we may notbelong to a tree at all! The evidence suggests that our history may berepresented best as a stand-alone shrub—an evolutionary bush—that begins andends with us.In other words, we may find that we’re a species unique unto ourselves.Key 13: A growing body of physical and DNA evidence suggests that our speciesmay have appeared 200,000 years ago with no evolutionary path leading to ourappearance.This is not to say that evolution doesn’t exist or hasn’t occurred anywhere. Itdoes and it has. As a geologist, I’ve seen firsthand the fossil record of theevolution that’s occurred in a number of other species. It’s just that when weattempt to apply what we know of the evolution of plants and animals to humans,the facts don’t support the theory. They fail to explain what the evidencereveals.If we were to place the essence of the new discoveries about us into a conciselist, the statements that follow would offer a high-level summary. Additionallythey would give us a good idea of where the new theories, and our new story, maybe heading.HERE’S WHAT WE’RE NOT * The theory of living cells evolving (mutating randomly) over long periods of time does not, and cannot, explain our origins or the complexities of our bodies. * The evolutionary family tree for humans is not supported with physical evidence. * DNA studies prove that we did not descend from Neanderthals, as previously believed. * We have not changed since the first of our kind, the anatomically modern humans, appeared in the fossil record of the earth approximately 200,000 years ago. * The precise events that produced the DNA that gives us our uniqueness are not commonplace in nature.So now that we know what we’re not, what does the best science of our time tellus about who we are? What does the new human story look like?HERE’S WHAT WE ARE * AMHs appeared on earth approximately 200,000 years ago with the DNA and the advanced brain and complex nervous system that set us apart from other forms of life already formed and functioning. * We appear to be a species unique unto ourselves, with our own simple family tree, rather than being a variation of preexisting forms of life traditionally shown on an increasingly crowded family tree. * The DNA that makes us unique is the result of a rare arrangement of chromosomes, which are fused and optimized in a way that cannot be identified as random.Key 14: An honest scientist, who is not bound by the constraints of academia,politics, or religion can no longer discount the new evidence about our humanorigins and still remain credible.In the course of my life, I’ve discovered that when I find something that makesno sense to me, it’s generally because I don’t have all the information. Ibelieve that the conventional scientific theory of human origins—the story we’vebeen asked to accept—falls into this category. The evidence that I’ve shared inthis chapter clearly doesn’t support Darwin’s story of evolution. While thescience is good and the methods scientists use are sound ones, it’s ourresponsibility to recognize the limits of what science can reveal. As Imentioned previously, while scientific evidence can definitely tell us what hashappened in the past, it cannot necessarily tell us why something has happenedor if conscious intention led to the event.For example, when we see a fire brightly burning on a warm summer night in themiddle of a grassy field, scientific knowledge tells us that a spark of somekind has ignited that fire. It’s telling us that a fire can only come from a) asource of heat great enough to start the fire (the kindling temperature), or b)another fire, such as the accidental spark of a lawnmower blade hitting a rock,the intentional spark of a match or a cigarette lighter, or the natural spark oflightning striking the ground. My point here is that without first knowing thecircumstances that were in place when the fire began, science can’t tell us theprecise reason that the spark occurred, or if it was an intentional act. If afire occurred hundreds or thousands of years in the past, much of the evidencerelated to its circumstances would be lost in the fog of time. All we would knowfrom the charred remains of a log or a scorched rock is that there had been afire.The fusion of DNA in human chromosome 2 is like that fire in the field. Sciencecan tell us that the fusion making it possible occurred and how that fusionoccurred. But because scientists can’t determine all of the circumstancessurrounding the fusion—as these have been lost over the ages—we’re left to relyupon facts, logic, and deductive reasoning to make sense of what we see. Thesame point that I’m making here for our chromosome 2 can be made for our geneFOXP2.WE’RE HUMAN BY DESIGNI want to be absolutely clear that what I say next is not the conclusion ofpeer-reviewed science, although I’ve spoken with mainstream scientists who havetold me that they suspect it is true, yet are reluctant to speak publicly abouttheir suspicions for fear of losing their reputation, their credibility, andeven their jobs. When I honestly consider the evidence that I’ve shared in thesechapters, it simply makes sense to look beyond evolution and an unbelievablygood run of biological “luck” to explain the fact of our existence.The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that: 1. We are the result of an intentional act of creation. * The mutations in FOXP2 and human chromosome 2 are precise * The mutations in FOXP2 and human chromosome 2 appear to have happened quickly rather than through a long, slow evolutionary process * The optimization of human chromosome 2 that occurred after the fusion appears to be intentional * After 150 years of searching, the fact that no physical evidence has been discovered to link us to other forms of life on the tree of primate evolution suggests that we may be a species unto ourselves, with no evolutionary history 2. We are the products of an intelligent form of life. * The timing, precision, and accuracy of our genetic mutations, and the technology required to yield such mutations, implies the forethought and intention of an advanced intelligence * The intelligence that carried out the genetic modifications giving us our humanness had the advanced technology to do 200,000 years ago what we are only learning to do today (for example, DNA fusion and gene splicing)To honestly acknowledge these possibilities opens us to a paradigm that shiftsthe way we feel about ourselves and view our place in the universe. With thisshift, we free ourselves from a paradigm of lonely insignificance and move intoone of possessing a rare heritage that we are only beginning to explore. Andthat’s where this book begins. We’re here with the bodies and the nervoussystems that afford us the abilities of compassion, empathy, intuition,self-healing, and much more. The fact of their presence within us suggests thatwe’re intended to utilize—and master—the sensitivities that we arrived with.The new human story begins with our beginnings. It begins with the fact thatfrom the time of our origin we’ve been neurologically wired for extraordinaryabilities. This design affords us extraordinary ways of living and extraordinarylives.The question that immediately comes to mind when we consider that we’ve had suchadvanced characteristics from our beginning is this: How do we fully awakenthese capabilities in our lives today? In the chapters that follow, I invite youto share a journey of discovery in which we do our best to answer this questionand explore what it means to be human by design."},{"pageContent":"chapter three [contents.xhtml#toc6]image [images/img-83-1.png]THE BRAIN IN THE HEART [contents.xhtml#toc6]Heart Cells That Think, Feel, and Remember [contents.xhtml#toc6]“If the 20th century has been, so to speak, the Century of the Brain, then the21st century should be the Century of the Heart.”— GARY E. R. SCHWARTZ, PH.D., AND LINDA G. S. RUSSEK, PH.D.The first fossils of anatomically modern humans were discovered under a rockledge in southwestern France in 1868. The name given the formation where thediscovery was made is abri de Cro-Magnon (meaning, in the local dialect,“shelter of the cave-dwelling Magnon family”), which was soon shortened toCro-Magnon.1 [endnotes.xhtml#fn63] This location became the namesake forCro-Magnon humans, now known as AMHs. Regardless of the name we use to describethe early people who lived in this region of France, these ancient humans weredifferent from any other form of life that existed at the time or has existedsince.Just as forensic scientists today are able to use computers to reconstruct themuscle mass, flesh, and facial features of a modern human body that’s beenreduced to a skeleton, scientists have been able to use the same technology onAMH skeletons as well, and the features they’ve been able to reconstruct looklike ours—because they are us! The archaeological and DNA evidence tells us thatwe haven’t changed for 200,000 years.Anatomically modern humans had features that set them apart from other ancientbeings, such as the Neanderthals, whom we now know lived at the same time. AMHmales, averaging approximately five feet nine inches,2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn64]were tall in comparison to Neanderthal males, whose height ranged from five feetfour to five feet five.3 [endnotes.xhtml#fn65] AMH bone structure was thinnerand more delicate overall, their skulls were more rounded in the back, and theirfaces were smaller, with more pointed chins.In addition to these visible differences, AMHs had advanced biology—differencesthat couldn’t be seen with the naked eye that gave them an edge over all otherforms of life on earth. Many scientists attribute their survival through thelast ice age into modern times to these advanced features, which include a brain50 percent larger than that of their nearest primate relative; a complexlanguage; an anatomy that enables them to stand, walk, and run upright; andopposing thumbs and fingers.For clarity, I want to reemphasize that the makeup of the AMHs of 200,000 yearsago has been determined to be essentially the same as that of humans today, bothin genetics as well as physiology. Because of this, the assumption is that theadvanced features we have today were also part of our human ancestors. Theirinherent features would have included the ability we have today to tap thenetwork of neurons, vital organs, and glands throughout the body to triggertheir extraordinary potentials in a conscious way—and do so at will—toexperience benefits such as deep intuition and self-healing.I’m contrasting the presence of this network in AMHs to other forms of life thathave neural networks as well, yet are less developed and must rely uponsomething in their external environment to trigger the benefits of theirbiology. A small zebra fish, commonly used in laboratory experiments, is aperfect example of what I mean here. It’s only when the fish is stimulated bysomething outside of its body, such as a visual cue that makes the fish thinkit’s drifting backward in a current, that 80 percent of the neurons in its brainfire all at once. This is the equivalent of signaling All systems go! in thefish’s body. It’s this simultaneous triggering of neurons that gives the fishimmediate access to the benefits of such a coherent experience. In thisinstance, the zebra fish is able to tap the combined neural power to swimquickly and correct its course.4 [endnotes.xhtml#fn66]Ancient humans had the ability to access their neural power without the need foran external signal as well. They could trigger their potent network ofspecialized cells and organs on demand. And we continue to have that abilitytoday.This is where the new human story that our biology is revealing to us departsfrom Darwin’s original ideas about evolution. Having conscious access to ouradvanced neural network gives us the godlike powers of intuition, self-healing,super-consciousness, and much more. These benefits have been utilized by yogisand shamans throughout the ages and described in their sacred mystical texts.Perhaps it’s not surprising that the key to accessing such advanced features ofour experience begins with our mastery of the single organ that has been thefocus of our ancestors’ teachings for millennia: the human heart.A recent discovery within the heart is shaking the foundation of what we’ve beenled to believe about the heart’s role when it comes to us and our bodies.Interestingly, while the discovery is overturning traditional thinking when itcomes to which organ we consider to be the master organ of the body, it actuallyparallels teachings found in our most ancient and cherished traditions.THE UNCHARTED HEARTWhen average people are asked to identify the organ that controls the keyfunctions of the body, more often than not the answer is the same. They’ll sayit’s the brain. And it’s no surprise that they do. From Leonard da Vinci’s day,500 years ago, until as recently as the late 1990s, people throughout theWestern-educated world have believed that the brain is the conductor leading asymphony of functions in the body that keep us alive and well.It’s what we’ve been taught. It’s what we’ve been led to believe. It’s whatteachers have stated with authority. It’s the premise that doctors andhealth-care workers have based life-or-death decisions upon. And it’s what mostpeople will say when asked to identify the roles of the most important organs ofthe body. The belief that the brain is the master organ of the human body hasbeen embraced and endorsed by the some of the most innovative scientists andthinkers at the most highly esteemed institutions and universities in modernhistory, and it persists in mainstream thinking today.The home page on the website for the Mayfield Clinic, affiliated with theUniversity of Cincinnati’s neurosurgery department, is a beautiful example ofthis way of thinking when it comes to the brain. It reads:The brain is an amazing three-pound organ that controls all functions of thebody, interprets information from the outside world, and embodies the essence ofthe mind and soul. Intelligence, creativity, emotion, and memory are a few ofthe many things governed by the brain.5 [endnotes.xhtml#fn67]The belief that the brain is the control center for the human body, ouremotions, and our memories has been so universally accepted that it’s been takenfor granted almost without question for a long time—that is, until now. As thediscoveries described in the following chapters will reveal, this perspective isonly one piece of a much bigger story.Today, what we thought we knew about the brain is changing. It has to. Thereason is simple: The discoveries described in this chapter, and the decades ofresearch that have followed, tell us that the brain is only part of the story.While it’s certainly true that the brain’s functions include things likeperception, motor skills, information processing, providing chemical triggersfor every urge we feel automatically—including fatigue, hunger, and sexualdesire—and also maintaining the strength of our immune system, it’s also truethat the brain can’t do these things alone. The brain is only one part of thebigger picture that’s still emerging and largely untold. It’s a story thatbegins in the heart.Key 15: As part of our advanced nervous system, the heart partners with thebrain as a master organ to inform the brain of what the body needs in any givenmoment.THE HUMAN HEART: MORE THAN JUST A PUMPWhen I was in school, I was taught that the main purpose of the heart is to moveblood through the body. I was told that the heart is a pump—an amazing pump, yetstill a pump, plain and simple. I was also taught that the heart has one job,which is to keep blood moving over the course of our lifetime. By any measurethis is an extraordinary accomplishment, as the adult heart beats an average of101,000 times a day. As it does so, it circulates approximately 2,000 gallons ofblood through 60,000 miles of arteries, capillaries, veins, and other bloodvessels!6 [endnotes.xhtml#fn68]A growing body of scientific evidence now suggests, however, that the pumping ofthe heart, as important as this function is, may pale in comparison to theadditional functions of the heart that have only recently been discovered. Inother words, while the heart does pump blood powerfully and efficiently throughthe body, pumping may not be its primary, or exclusive, purpose.For thousands of years, our ancestors regarded the human heart as the center ofthought, emotion, memory, and personality—the true master organ of the body.Traditions to honor the role of the heart were created and passed down throughgeneration after generation. Ceremonies were performed and techniques developedto utilize the heart as a conduit of intuition and healing.The heart is mentioned 830 times in the Bible, and the word heart appears in 59of the Bible’s 66 books.7 [endnotes.xhtml#fn69] The book of Proverbs describesthe heart as a source of vast wisdom that requires a cultivated understanding tomake sense of it: “Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water; but a manof understanding will draw it out.”8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn70]The same sentiment is stated clearly in the native wisdom of the North AmericanOmaha people, whose tradition invites us: “Ask questions from your heart and youwill be answered from the heart.”9 [endnotes.xhtml#fn71]The Lotus Sutra of the Mahayana Buddhist tradition teaches of the “hiddentreasure of the heart.”10 [endnotes.xhtml#fn72] This treasure is described inthe scripture as being “as vast as the universe itself, which dispels anyfeelings of powerlessness.”11 [endnotes.xhtml#fn73]Key 16: Ancient traditions have always held that the heart, rather than thebrain, is the center of deep wisdom, emotion, and memory, as well as serving asa portal to other realms of existence.Clearly references such as these are referring to the heart as something muchmore than a physical pump. They’re telling us, just as the visionary philosopherRudolf Steiner, the creator of the Waldorf method of education, and HarvardUniversity’s bio-dynamic agriculture scientist John Bremer suggested to HarvardMedical School students early in the 20th century, that there’s something moreto the heart than we’ve been led to believe.12 [endnotes.xhtml#fn74]If we’re willing to embrace what the following discoveries tell us, we can agreewith Steiner and Bremer that our hearts are capable of something much moremysterious, powerful, and beautiful than simply being a pump.Our exploration to know ourselves has created a journey that swings like theextremes of a pendulum. From the time my life began in the early 1950s untiltoday, I’ve seen the pendulum of thinking swing from an extreme view of theheart as an isolated pump that can be serviced and replaced like a machine backtoward a balanced view that the heart is much more than just a pump. There is anew recognition of the heart as an integral source of memories, intuition, anddeep wisdom, as well as a biological organ that gives us life. This shift ofviews invites us to rethink which organ we can honestly call the master organ ofthe body.THE “LITTLE BRAIN” IN THE HEARTIn 1991, a scientific discovery published in the journal Neurocardiology put torest any lingering doubt that the human heart is more than a pump. The name ofthe journal gives us a clue to the discovery of a powerful relationship betweenthe heart and the brain that went unrecognized in the past. A team of scientistsled by J. Andrew Armour, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Montreal, which wasstudying this intimate relationship between heart and brain, found that about40,000 specialized neurons, or sensory neurites, form a communication networkwithin the heart.13 [endnotes.xhtml#fn75]For clarity, let me say that the term neuron describes a specialized cell thatcan be excited (electrically stimulated) in a way that allows it to shareinformation with other cells in the body. While large numbers of neurons areobviously concentrated in the brain and along the spinal cord, the discovery ofthese cells in the heart and other organs, in smaller numbers, gives new insightinto the profound level of communication that exists within the body.Neurites are tiny projections that come from the main body of a neuron toperform different functions in the body. Some carry information away from theneuron to connect with other cells, while others detect signals from varioussources and carry them toward the neuron. What makes this discovery exceptionalis that the neurites in the heart perform many of the same functions that arefound in the brain.14 [endnotes.xhtml#fn76]In simple terms, Armour and his team discovered what has come to be known as thelittle brain in the heart, and the specialized neurites that make the existenceof this little brain possible. As the scientists who made the discovery say intheir report, “The ‘heart brain’ is an intricate network of nerves,neurotransmitters, proteins, and support cells similar to those found in thebrain proper.”15 [endnotes.xhtml#fn77]Key 17: The discovery of 40,000 sensory neurites in the human heart opens thedoor to vast new possibilities that parallel those that have been accuratelydescribed in the scriptures of some of our most ancient and cherished spiritualtraditions.A key role of the brain in the heart is to detect changes of hormones and otherchemicals within the body and communicate those changes to the brain so it canmeet our needs accordingly.The heart’s brain does this by converting the language of the body—emotions—intothe electrical language of the nervous system so that its messages make sense tothe brain. The heart’s coded messages inform the brain when we need moreadrenaline, for example, in a stressful situation, or when it’s safe to createless adrenaline and focus on building a stronger immune system.Now that the little brain in the heart has been recognized by researchers, therole it plays in a number of physical and metaphysical functions has also cometo light. These functions include: * Direct heart communication with sensory neurites in other organs in the body * The heart-based wisdom known as heart intelligence * Intentional states of deep intuition * Intentional precognitive abilities * The mechanism of intentional self-healing * The awakening of super-learning abilities * And much moreThe heart’s little brain has been found to function in two distinct yet relatedways. It can act: * Independently of the cranial brain to think, learn, remember, and even sense our inner and outer worlds on its own16 [endnotes.xhtml#fn78] * In harmony with the cranial brain to give us the benefit of a single, potent neural network shared by the two separate organs17 [endnotes.xhtml#fn79]Armour’s discovery has the potential to forever change the way we think ofourselves. It gives new meaning to what’s possible in our bodies and what we’recapable of achieving in our lives. In his words: “It has become clear in recentyears that a sophisticated two-way communication occurs between the heart andthe brain, with each influencing the other’s function.”18 [endnotes.xhtml#fn80]The science from the new field of neurocardiology is just beginning to catch upwith traditional beliefs when it comes to explaining experiences such asintuition, precognition, and self-healing. This is especially apparent when weexamine the principles offered in some of our most ancient and cherishedspiritual traditions. Almost universally, historical teachings demonstrate anunderstanding of the heart’s role at the level of having direct influence uponour personalities, our daily decisions, and our ability to make moral choicesthat include the discernment of right and wrong.The Coptic Christian saint Macarius, founder of an ancient Egyptian monasterythat bears his name, powerfully captured these levels of potential within theheart in saying:The heart itself is but a little vessel, and yet there are dragons, and thereare lions, and there are venomous beasts, and all the treasures of wickedness;and there are rough uneven ways, there chasms; there likewise is God, there theangels, there life and the kingdom, there light and the apostles, there theheavenly cities, there the treasures, there are all things.19[endnotes.xhtml#fn81]Among the “all things” that St. Macarius described, we must now include the newdiscoveries that document the ability of our hearts to remember life events—evenwhen the heart is no longer in the body of the person that experienced theevents.MEMORIES THAT LIVE IN THE HEARTOne of the mysteries of heart transplants is that an undamaged heart willcontinue to beat after being removed from its original owner—sometimes for aperiod of hours—and is able to resume functioning after it’s placed in a newbody and connected to new blood vessels and nerves. The crux of the mystery isthis: If the brain were truly the master organ of the body, responsible forsending instructions to the heart telling it to beat and pump blood, thenwouldn’t the heart stop beating and functioning after it had lost its connectionto the brain? Why does it function without those instructions?The following true-life accounts, and the discovery they led to, shed a powerfullight on the mystery of the heart and offer new insight into its deeper role inour everyday lives.image [images/img-92-1.png]The first successful human heart transplant took place in Cape Town, SouthAfrica, on December 3, 1967. On that day, Christiaan Barnard, M.D., placed theheart of a 25-year-old woman who had been in a fatal automobile accident intothe body of Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old man with a damaged heart.20[endnotes.xhtml#fn82] From a medical standpoint, the procedure was anoverwhelming success. The woman’s heart immediately began functioning within theman’s body, just as the transplant team had expected.One of the biggest hurdles in all transplants, including Washkansky’s, is thatthe immune system of the person receiving the heart (or any organ for thatmatter) does not recognize the new organ as its own and tries to reject theforeign tissue. For this reason, doctors use specialized drugs to suppress therecipient’s immune system and trick the body into accepting the new organ. Thegood news is that this technique is successful in reducing the chances ofrejection. The success comes with a high price, however.With a severely weakened immune system, the recipient of a new organ becomessusceptible to infections such as common colds, flu, and pneumonia. And this isprecisely what happened with the world’s first human heart transplant. AlthoughLouis Washkansky’s new heart functioned perfectly until his last breath, he died18 days after the transplant from complications of pneumonia. His survival witha new heart for over two weeks demonstrated, however, that an organ transplantwas a viable possibility in cases where an otherwise healthy body loses an organto accident or disease.In the decades that have followed Barnard’s first transplant, the procedureshave been perfected to the point that human heart transplants now happen on aroutine basis. In 2014, approximately 5,000 heart transplants were performedworldwide.21 [endnotes.xhtml#fn83] And while that number sounds high, when it iscompared to the list of 50,000 people waiting for a new heart from a compatibledonor, it’s clear that the demand for organ donors will remain high for theforeseeable future.22 [endnotes.xhtml#fn84]The reason that I’m sharing the background of heart transplants here is becauseit has a direct connection to the theme of this chapter. From the time of thefirst procedures, there has always been a curious phenomenon that’s nowacknowledged in the medical community as a possible side effect of a hearttransplant. It’s called memory transference. One of the earliest examples ofthis phenomenon was documented by the direct experience of a woman named ClaireSylvia who received a transplant in 1988. Her memoir, A Change of Heart, is anaccount of her experiences as a recipient and how they opened the door toresearchers for the serious study, and eventual acceptance, of how life’smemories can be preserved within the heart itself, regardless of whose body theheart resides within.23 [endnotes.xhtml#fn85]Sylvia, once a professional dancer, had successfully received the heart, as wellas the lungs, of a donor whose identity was not initially disclosed. Not longafter her operation, she began to crave foods that she’d never been especiallydrawn to in the past, such as chicken nuggets and green peppers. And when itcame to the nuggets, the cravings were very specific. Sylvia found herself drawnunexplainably to the restaurant chain KFC to satisfy her cravings. As she hadnever developed a taste for these kinds of foods before her surgery, herfriends, family, and doctor were mystified by the cravings.Just before her operation, she’d been told that she was receiving the organs ofa young man who had died in a motorcycle accident. Although the details ofdonors are generally not shared with the person receiving their organs, Sylviafollowed up on the information she had and discovered the identity of the youngman in a local obituary, along with the address of his parents. It was during avisit she had with them that Sylvia learned some of the details about the lifeof their son, Tim, whose heart and lungs were now in her body. And those detailsconfirmed for her mind what she already sensed intuitively to be true: Tim lovedprecisely the kind of chicken nuggets and green peppers that she was nowcraving. It was clear that Tim’s desire for the foods he enjoyed in his lifetimewas now part of Sylvia’s experience and that she had acquired her cravingsthrough memory transference.24 [endnotes.xhtml#fn86]Key 18: Scientific documentation of memories carried from a donor into the bodyof a recipient through the heart itself—memory transference—demonstrates justhow real the heart’s memory is.While Claire Sylvia’s story is one of the earliest and best-documented accountsof memory transference through a heart transplant, there have been additionalexamples since. In each one, there is a change in the personality of the personwho gets a new heart. These changes range from a new preference for specificfoods to differences in personality and even sexual orientation that reflect thepreferences and personality of the donor.And while examples of personality changes are fascinating, the stories don’t endthere. The emotional memories of our lives appear to be so deeply ingrained inthe heart’s memory that they are preserved with tremendous clarity and arecommonly reexperienced by the person receiving the heart in a transplant.While skeptics of heart memory theories have proposed a number of alternativeexplanations for the post-transplant changes in personality and lifestyle,including drug reactions and subconscious influences, there’s a particular kindof experience that cannot be explained away by the skeptics’ theories. It’s thiskind of documented case history that has led to the acceptance of memorytransference as a fact of life rather than a curious coincidence.IF THE HEART IS ALIVE, THE MEMORIES REMAINTwo years after Claire Sylvia’s book came out, in 1999, Paul Pearsall, M.D., aneuropsychologist, published another pioneering book documenting case historiesof the heart’s memory. This book, The Heart’s Code, included true-life accountsof the memories and dreams, even nightmares, experienced by people who hadundergone heart transplants. What made one of the accounts so extraordinary isthat the recipient’s experiences could be confirmed as factual events that hadhappened in the donor’s lifetime. This case involved an eight-year-old girl whoreceived a heart from another girl two years her elder.Almost immediately after the surgery, the young girl began having vivid andfrightening dreams—nightmares—of being chased, attacked, and killed. While hertransplant was a success technically, the psychological impact of the nightmarescontinued. She was eventually referred to a psychiatrist for a mental healthevaluation. The events and images that the young girl described were so clear,consistent, and detailed that the psychiatrist was convinced the dreams weremore than curious by-products of the transplant. She felt sure that the girl wasdescribing memories of a real-life experience. The question was, from whosememory?The authorities were eventually brought in on the case and quickly discoveredthat the girl was recounting the details of an unsolved murder that had occurredin their town. She could share the specifics of where, when, and how the murderhappened. She could even repeat the words that were spoken during the attack andname the murderer. Based upon the details she provided, police were able tolocate and arrest a man that fit the circumstances and description. Eventuallyhe was put on trial and convicted of the assault and murder of the ten-year-oldgirl whose heart was now in the body of the eight-year-old.25[endnotes.xhtml#fn87]This account tells us how real the little brain in our hearts is, and how it canfunction in ways that were once believed to happen only in the cranial brain.The discovery of this second brain in the heart, and the compelling evidence ofits ability to think and remember, has opened the door to a vast array ofpossibilities in our lives.What does the hidden potential of the heart mean for our lives? Since the timeLeonardo da Vinci first diagrammed the nerves connecting the brain to the majororgans in the body nearly 600 years ago, we’ve been led to view the heart andbrain from an either/or perspective.26 [endnotes.xhtml#fn88] Scientists,engineers, and analytical problem solvers have long felt that the brain is themaster control center for the functions in the rest of the body, so they’veoften discounted the heart. At the same time, artists, musicians, and intuitivethinkers have typically felt that the heart is the key to inspiration, insightinto life challenges, and the deep wisdom that can guide our lives, and havereadily discounted the thinking capacity of the brain in these roles. It’s nowapparent why this either/or thinking generally doesn’t work out so well.To separate the brain from the heart gives us an incomplete picture of our fullpotential. Clearly, the more we discover about the way the heart and brain canfunction as a single network to regulate the body, it becomes clear that ourgreatest benefit comes from harmonizing both organs to work together rather thanfocusing on one or the other exclusively. The more we understand about how tocreate heart-brain harmony, the more we can use this understanding to tap thepower of our greatest potentials!Twentieth-century playwright and congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce once said, “Theheight of sophistication is simplicity.”27 [endnotes.xhtml#fn89] The truth ofher words applies especially to nature. Nature is simple and elegant until wemake it difficult through awkward descriptions and complex formulas. So whatcould be simpler than the brain in our hearts and the brain in our headsnaturally forming a single, potent network that enables us to experience deepintuition, empathy, and compassion in our lives?While these sorts of remarkable states of consciousness are typically attributedto the extraordinary skill of trained mystics, monks, and yogis, my sense isthat these are actually ordinary states of consciousness available to each of usthat our culture has simply forgotten.HEART WISDOM IN EVERYDAY LIFEHave you ever been faced with a decision that seemed impossible to make? Maybeit was a question of whether to go forward with a medical procedure that wasn’taligned with your belief system. Maybe it was whether to stay in a difficultrelationship or end it. Maybe if you answered the question the wrong way, you ora loved one would face life-or-death consequences.As different as these issues are from one another, the thing that links thedecisions is that none has an absolute answer. For each situation there isneither right nor wrong. There is no “book of truth” you can turn to when facingtough decisions that will tell you which option is best. And if you’ve ever beenin a situation where you had to make this kind of decision, you probablydiscovered that every friend you ask for help has a unique opinion as to why acertain path is right for you, so you end up with a collection of opinions thatmake the original choice even more confusing.Or maybe something else happened. Maybe you did follow the recommendation of aclose friend or relative who meant well in trying to help. Maybe you tried theage-old solution of answering your question by making a list of pros and cons.This was my mother’s advice for how to handle every tough decision when I wasgrowing up.“On a sheet of paper, make two columns,” she would say. “Title one column‘Pros,’ for the good things about your choice, and the other column ‘Cons,’ forthe things that are not so good. Then add up the pros and cons and you’ll haveyour answer. And if that doesn’t work, go ask your father.”I can tell you from experience that neither of these solutions works. Before heleft our family when I was 10 years old, my father was largely unavailable whenit came to the big questions of life. So if my mother couldn’t answer myquestion, I had few options. And the list that my mother would ask me to makealways seemed to be skewed in favor of what I wanted the answer to be, ratherthan what the best answer really was.The reason it’s so difficult to make big decisions that have no clear answer isdirectly linked to the way we’ve been conditioned to think. Most of us have beentrained to think exclusively with our brains. And while there are times when itdefinitely serves us to use mental reasoning, such as when we’re creatingstep-by-step plans to build a house, solve a complex mathematical problem, orlay out steps leading to income security in the future, there are times when weactually limit ourselves by trying to answer life’s big questions throughreasoning alone. Solving our problems through reasoning alone can sometimes be aslow and cumbersome process for two main reasons: * Thought-based choices are typically filtered through our perceptions and past experience. When it comes to choosing our role in an intimate relationship, for example, our logic-based decision is made through the filters of our self-image. This is why our answer to the question Who am I? is so important. Our minds will make the choice to continue a relationship, or to end it, through the lens of our sense of personal worth. As we’ll see in the next chapter, that sense is, in part, derived from the scientific story of evolution and the feeling of insignificance it gives us. * Our minds tend to justify the answers we arrive at using circular reasoning, a way of thinking that supports a conclusion by restating it. For example, if I were to say to you, “I like Bon Jovi because it’s my favorite band,” the circular part of the reasoning is shown by my stating the same thought twice, using the words like and favorite. With them, I would be using the second thought to justify the first, and the first thought to justify the second. This kind of reasoning can play out in unexpected ways, such as reinforcing our fear of taking a chance with a new and challenging job that’s been offered to us and justifying turning it down. In such an instance, the circular logic goes something like this: I already have a safe position in a good company ➜ If I accept the new job and the new responsibilities, I may not be able to meet the expectations that come with it ➜ If I lose the new job I’m not safe ➜ I already have a safe position in a good company.To be clear, I’m not suggesting that any of the preceding characteristics ofmental problem solving is bad, or even good, for that matter. What I am sayinghere is that there are different kinds of challenges in life that are bestsolved through different ways of thinking—some with the brain and some with theheart. And while heart-based thinking may be less familiar in our fast-pacedworld of technology and digital information, in a very real sense heart-basedwisdom is perhaps the most sophisticated technology we could ever have at ourdisposal.Rather than thinking through the pros and cons of a decision, or weighing theodds that an experience from the past will repeat itself in the present, ourheart intelligence knows instantly what’s true for us in the moment. Regardlessof whether we choose to accept or ignore the heart’s wisdom, it’s there for us.This is true when it comes to how we feel about other people, as well as whenwe’re making important choices in our lives. Scientific studies into theaccuracy of our first impressions when it comes to trusting another person are aperfect example of the heart’s wisdom that we’ve all experienced at some pointin our lives.THE HEART KNOWS IMMEDIATELYA study led by Alex Todorov, Ph.D., a Princeton University psychologist, showedthat when we meet another person for the first time, our assessment of thatperson is almost immediate. “We decide very quickly whether a person possessesmany of the traits we feel are important, such as likeability and competence,even though we have not exchanged a single word with them,” he says. “It appearsthat we are hard-wired to draw these inferences in a fast, unreflective way.”28[endnotes.xhtml#fn90]When we think about how quickly we form our opinions of people we’ve never met,it actually makes perfect sense. It’s nature’s way of keeping us safe. Ourancestors, for example, didn’t have the luxury of visiting for hours to get toknow the people they came face-to-face with as they wandered the world in searchof food and a friendly climate. They didn’t get to sit down with a leisurely cupof tea and ask about the mutual interests, family history, or favorite pastimesof the people wrapped in bear hide looming over them, spears in hand. They hadto know quickly, almost instantaneously, whether or not they were safe. And ifthey weren’t, they needed time to react. Knowing the answers to these questionswithin a millisecond or two gave them the time do so.Although the circumstances of our lives have certainly changed as a result ofmodern society, our basic human experience remains much the same as it hasalways been. When we meet someone for the first time, we still need to know asquickly as possible 1) if we are safe and 2) if we can trust them. This is truein business, with friendships, and especially when it comes to love, romance,and intimacy. While scientists have traditionally attributed our firstimpressions of one another to brain functions, new evidence suggests that it’smore than the brain alone making the judgment. The heart plays a vital role inhelping us make split-second decisions.The Institute of HeartMath, often abbreviated as IHM, is a pioneering researchorganization dedicated to exploring and understanding the full potential of thehuman heart, sometimes going beyond what is typically done in universitylaboratories and classrooms. I want to clarify that while I’m not an employee ofIHM, for over 20 years I’ve worked with them closely to share many of theirscience-based discoveries with mainstream audiences.29 [endnotes.xhtml#fn91]Throughout the remainder of this book I will reference IHM research,discoveries, and techniques, with IHM permission, to illustrate the applicationsof embracing the heart’s potential in our lives. A summary of studies conductedby IHM regarding intuition, for example, beautifully states the heart’s role inour decisions:At the center of this ability [intuition] is the human heart, which encompassesa degree of intelligence whose sophistication and vastness we are continuing tounderstand and explore. We now know this intelligence may be cultivated to ouradvantage in many ways.30 [endnotes.xhtml#fn92]As mentioned previously, it’s because heart intelligence bypasses the filters ofthe brain (thoughts related to past experiences, self-esteem, and so forth) thatit can make its decisions regarding our safety and well-being almostinstantaneously. Alex Todorov’s study found that we make a judgment in as littleas a tenth of a second when we encounter a new face.A number of additional studies have found that, just as our mothers told us innonscientific terms, first impressions are generally spot-on. Because we live ina society that has traditionally discounted intuition in the past, however, weoften find ourselves discounting our first impressions when it comes to the mostimportant choices of our lives.I have had friends, for example, who confided in me that the first time theyencountered the person they would marry, their impression was to run away, andrun fast! Rather than listening to their hearts’ wisdom, however, theyrationalized what they were feeling and did the opposite. From all outwardappearances, there seemed to be no good reason not to go forward with theirrelationships.In one instance, it was only after 12 years of marriage that my friend, a womanwith whom I shared a corporate office, admitted to herself that her firstimpression of her husband had been correct. The man she’d married did not growto respect her any more in the 12 years of their marriage than she felt he didwhen they first met. The key here is that she knew—her heart knew—almostinstantly (in as little as one-tenth of a second) that the relationship wasn’tsafe. Because she ignored her heart’s wisdom, she devoted 12 years of her lifeto arriving at the same conclusion. During those 12 years, she had experiencesthat empowered her to think differently about herself and accept that she wasworthy of receiving more respect than her husband demonstrated.When we hear of experiences like this, it becomes clear that rather thanthinking in terms of black-and-white decisions that may look good on paper, wehave the opportunity to be informed from a deeper wisdom that transcends thebias of the mind. Ultimately, it all comes down to our intuition and what wefeel in our hearts.AWAKENING OUR HEARTS’ WISDOMEmbracing the benefits of our hearts’ wisdom can immediately catapult us beyondtraditional boundaries when it comes to the way we live, our capacity to solveproblems, and even our capacity for love. It’s these capabilities as well thatgive us the resilience to embrace big change in our lives—and to do so in ahealthy way. When we take into consideration all that we now know about theheart—such as the fact that it is part of an extended neural network that wasalready developed when our ancestors appeared on earth 200,000 years ago; thefact that we have a little brain in our hearts made of cells that think, feel,and remember independently of the brain; and the fact that we can self-activatethe benefits that come from the relationship of the brain and heart—the questionnow is, what else does the heart do that we’re only beginning to understand?What capabilities await discovery today that we’ve either forgotten we possessor are only just now beginning to understand fully?Key 19: The heart is the key to awakening deep intuition, subtle memories, andextraordinary abilities thought to be rare in the past, and to embracing theseattributes as a normal part of everyday life."},{"pageContent":"chapter four [contents.xhtml#toc7]image [images/img-105-1.png]THE NEW HUMAN STORY [contents.xhtml#toc7]Life with a Purpose [contents.xhtml#toc7]“When we deny our stories, they define us. When we own our stories, we get towrite a brave new ending.”— BRENÉ BROWN (1965–), AMERICAN RESEARCHERWhen we answer the question Who are we? from the point of view of conventionalscience, is it possible that not only are we on the wrong track, we’re stuck onthat track, and it is leading us farther and farther from understanding the mostempowering truths of our lives? Being stuck on the wrong track has happenedbefore, and the scientific community is still reeling after discovering how faroff their expectations were the last time an accepted theory was provenmistaken.THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED!At the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 2001, scientists wereastonished to learn that the genetic blueprint for a human is about 75 percentsmaller than they’d thought it would be. This wasn’t just a little mistake incalculation. It was such a huge discrepancy from the original thinking that theinternational community of biologists and geneticists involved in the projecthad to acknowledge a difficult fact regarding their fundamental assumptions.Before the HGP, it was believed that there would be a unique gene for creatingeach one of the unique proteins that make up our bodies. Based upon this idea ofone-to-one correspondence, researchers expected that the project would identifyat least 100,000 genes in the human genetic blueprint. Scientists andentrepreneurs were so certain of this, in fact, that they had planned to developpharmaceutical products to modify and “fix” the genes that were discovered, andbuild an entire new industry of gene medicine, once the results of the projectwere known.1 [endnotes.xhtml#fn93] No one anticipated the actual results of thisproject. And when those results came in, scientists in universities, researchinstitutions, and medical laboratories throughout the world had to come to termswith a surprising new reality.The HGP revealed that there are only about 20,000 to 24,000 genes in the humangenome, 75,000 fewer than had been expected!2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn94] The questionwas, where were the “missing” genes? Did they even exist?Further research done following the HGP revealed where the original thinking ofthe scientists was flawed. Rather than one gene coding for one protein, we nowknow that a single gene can produce the codes for multiple proteins, sometimesnumbering in the thousands. One gene from a fruit fly, for example, can code formany as many as 38,000 different proteins.3 [endnotes.xhtml#fn95] The sameprinciple appears to be true for humans, only to a lesser degree. “It seems tobe a matter of five to six proteins, on average, from one gene,” says Victor A.McKusick, co-author of the landmark paper that described the HGP findings in2001.4 [endnotes.xhtml#fn96]But how could such a fundamental error in thinking have gone undetected for solong? How could the basic assumption at the foundation of a futuristic new fieldof science, one that was believed would lead to creating an entire new industryof medicines, be so flawed?The answer to this question is the reason I’m describing this account. Themistake was due to the scientific acceptance of an unproven theory—theassumption of the one-to-one correspondence between genes and proteins—thatscientists had made years earlier in the mid-20th century.Craig Venter, the president of a firm leading one of the HGP gene-mapping teams,recognized the significance of the HGP results immediately when he stated, “Wehave only 300 unique genes in the human that are not in the mouse. This tells megenes can’t possibly explain all of what makes us what we are.”5[endnotes.xhtml#fn97]The HGP illustrates a perfect example of the consequences of embracing ascientific assumption as fact in the absence of evidence to support it. In thisinstance, an entire field of science and medicine, and the people and industriesrelying upon the science and medicine, was thrown into chaos by the errors injudgment. The outcome of the HGP also forced the rethinking of a basic premisethat had been wholeheartedly embraced by scientists and taught as fact inuniversity classrooms. And while scientists now appear to be on the right trackwhen it comes to the way genes and proteins are related, the Human GenomeProject is not the only time an unproven doctrine has led scientists to a deadend in their assumptions. If it were, we could call what happened with theproject an anomaly. But it’s not an anomaly. The example of the HGP illustratesa way of thinking that we’ve seen before in the not-so-distant past.SAME EXPERIMENT, NEW EQUIPMENT, AND A NEW RESULT!The scientific belief that everything we can see and touch is separate fromeverything else is another example of the kind of thinking that has led to ascientific dead end. The idea of separation has its roots in the famousMichelson-Morley experiment originally performed in 1887. Named for the twoscientists who designed the experiment, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, thisexperiment was the much-anticipated effort of the scientific community tosettle, once and for all, the question of whether or not a universal field ofenergy connects all things.6 [endnotes.xhtml#fn98] The thinking at the time wasthat if such a field actually existed, it would move in relation to the earth.And because the field would be in motion, it would be possible to detect thatmotion.The experiment was performed in a makeshift laboratory in the basement of abuilding at Case Western Reserve University. The results of the experiment, asthe data were interpreted by scientists of the time, were thought to prove thatno universal energy field exists, with the implication that everything isseparate from everything else—meaning what happens in one place has littleeffect, if any, on what happens somewhere else.These findings became the foundation of scientific theory and classroominstruction for nearly a full century. Until Michelson and Morley’s 19th-centuryexperiment was repeated in the 20th century, multiple generations grew upbelieving that we live in a world where we’re separate from one another and theworld around us, and that what we do in one place has no effect beyond thatplace. This belief was reflected throughout our civilization in ways that rangedfrom personal choices that affected other people, and the growth of economicsystems that benefitted some people at the expense of others, to the biggerpicture of humanity’s relationship to the earth itself. For scientiststhroughout the world, the assumptions of Michelson and Morley were accepted asfact . . . that is, until the experiment was revisited 99 years later.In 1986, a scientist named E. W. Silvertooth duplicated the Michelson-Morleyexperiment in a study sponsored by the U.S. Air Force. Under the unassumingtitle “Special Relativity,” the scientific journal Nature published the results.Using detection equipment that was much more sensitive than what Michelson andMorley had in 1887, Silvertooth did detect the field, and it was moving just asMichelson and Morley had predicted it would 100 years before.7[endnotes.xhtml#fn99] In the process, he debunked a whole worldview.For nearly a century, the best science of the modern world was based upon anidea that simply wasn’t true. Fortunately we know better now and can apply thisknowledge. Yet even with the later experiment proving the existence of the fieldand the vital role it plays in our lives, the principle of separation continuesto be embraced today in some textbooks and taught in some university classrooms.Because of this, members of yet another generation are being led astray.I’m identifying the Michelson-Morley experiment and the Human Genome Project asclassic examples of how a scientific theory that’s held in high esteem at onepoint in time can, and must, change when a new discovery overturns earlierassumptions. It’s precisely this kind of discovery that is imploding the theoryof human evolution, and it’s of vital importance that our past assumptions mustbe personally abandoned and publicly dismissed when it comes to the belief thatthe DNA that makes us what and who we are formed purely by chance.Key 20: Willingness to embrace a scientific assumption as fact, in the absenceof evidence to support it, can lead us, and has led us in the past, to wrongconclusions when it comes to the way we think of ourselves and our relationshipto the world.IMPOSSIBLE ODDSThe conventional story of life on earth—the theory of evolution—asks us tobelieve that long ago, just the right conditions appeared in just the right wayand at just the right time to create just the right environment for the rightforces to form perfect atoms and forge them into the elements that gave birth tothe first molecule of life. As if asking us to believe this unlikely series ofevents isn’t already a stretch, we’re then asked to further accept that thisfirst molecule of life survived, and flourished, multiplying and diversifyingcountless times, and then triumphed through the ages via an adaptive strategyknown as “survival of the strongest” to become the bodies that enable us to leadthe lives that we lead today.The odds that this series of events actually occurred are so small that theyappear to be impossible.The late two-time Nobel Prize–winning chemist Ilya Prigogine agreed. “Thestatistical probability that organic structures and the most preciselyharmonized reactions that typify living organisms would be generated byaccident,” he said, “is zero.”8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn100] In agreement withPrigogine, many other scientists, using the most advanced scientific methodsavailable, are now able to tell us just how extraordinarily unlikely the chanceorigin of our DNA is.Before his death in 1989, Swiss mathematician and physicist Marcel Golaycalculated that the probability for even the simplest living protein to form bychance is 1 in 10450, while plant physiologist and former head of Utah StateUniversity Frank Salisbury calculated the probability for the existence of acommon DNA molecule as 1 in 10600.9 [endnotes.xhtml#fn101]These numbers are so unimaginably long and represent such a small chance ofsomething occurring that I’m going to elaborate briefly here to illustrate justwhat the mathematicians are telling us. To clarify, the number 10600 isshorthand for the British unit of one centillion or 1 with 600 zeros after it.If we convert this notation into longhand and type it out, here’s what it lookslike.1,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000This huge number is the longhand version showing the odds that the first DNAmolecule formed by chance. I’m emphasizing this point because scientistsgenerally accept that when the odds of a possibility occurring are 1 in 10110 ormore, the chances of that event happening are so small that it’s impossible. Ifthese numbers represented the chance of us winning the Powerball lottery, forexample, we’d probably throw our tickets away because the odds would be sostaggeringly small. So the scientists themselves are telling us that the factthat DNA exists at all represents a probability that’s already “impossible” at 1in 10110, and this impossibility can be further multiplied by a factor of 5, to1 in 10600, to make it even more improbable!English astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle and astrobiologist and mathematician ChandraWickramasinghe placed the odds even lower in a book they co-wrote, at less than1 in 1040,000, based upon the number of known enzymes needed for life and thechances of them appearing at random.10 [endnotes.xhtml#fn102] When we begintalking about odds this small, the numbers themselves become almost meaningless.For the non-mathematician, Hoyle aptly described these outrageous statistics asbeing the equivalent of a tornado sweeping through a junkyard and assembling aBoeing 747 jetliner from scattered debris.11 [endnotes.xhtml#fn103] And it’sthrough the eyes of this improbability that scientists are attempting to makesense of the origin of life. But if the evidence shows that we are the result ofsomething more than the pure chance proposed by the theory of evolution, thenthe fact of our existence must take on new meaning as well.Key 21: Renowned scientists tell us that it is mathematically impossible for thegenetic code of life to have emerged through the process of evolution alone.EVOLUTION: AN IMPOSSIBLY SQUARE PEG IN AN IMPOSSIBLY ROUND HOLEWhen Darwin introduced his theory of evolution in the mid-19th century, it wasbelieved that in the decades that would follow, new discoveries would furthervalidate the theory that was already accepted as scientific fact in his day.What has happened since that time, however, defies this expectation. Theevidence does not support human evolution. But rather than allowing the evidenceto lead us to write a new story of human origins, there has been a concertedeffort instead to force new discoveries into the framework of the existing storyof evolution.To recap, we see evidence of this in the efforts of mainstream scientists todraw a link between the ancient primate fossils of the past and modern humans onthe primate evolutionary tree. With some mainstream media outlets, such as PBS,neglecting to offer their audiences a balanced perspective, as they did in theirbiased documentary on evolution, and with some academics, such as biologistRichard Dawkins, going so far as to demean and ridicule anyone who questions theconventional wisdom when it comes to human origins, the insistence that theevidence sustain existing theories is akin to the proverbial forcing of thesquare peg into a round hole. While it’s certainly possible to pound a squarepeg until it’s jammed into a round opening, it will never fit well because itsimply doesn’t belong there.Discoveries about human DNA are telling us that our species doesn’t fit into theneat and tidy traditional story of evolution. Nonetheless, people continueattempting to jam the facts into the theory in a way that’s leading us away fromproperly solving the mystery of our existence.OUR POINT OF NO RETURNA friend of mine had a desktop computer that had been state-of-the-art, with allof the latest software, when she first purchased it nine years earlier. But asnew updates for the operating system became available over time, such asenhanced network security, faster operating speeds, and system upgrades, sheneglected to download them onto her computer. She was busy meeting workdeadlines and didn’t feel that the New upgrades available messages that showedup on her screen from time to time were a priority in her schedule.During the first couple of years or so, the failure to keep her system up todate influenced her computer only in subtle ways. Some of the upgrades weresmall and affected few of her everyday computing needs. These little upgradeswere noted as the number following the version: v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, and so on. Butwhen the developers made big changes in the software that warranted an entirelynew version, a v2.0, for example, it was a different story, because any newsoftware began looking in her computer for the features in the previous versionthat it could build upon.One day my friend was deep into the editing of a new book and she tried to opena file that she’d received from her editor, who was using another computeroperating system. That’s when everything changed and I received a phone callfrom her asking for help. “My computer is stuck! It’s frozen and I can’t eventurn it off,” she said.After a couple of useless suggestions from me, it dawned on me—knowing myfriend’s aversion to software upgrades—what might be happening. “What version ofyour operating system are you using?” I asked.Her answer told me the reason for her computer problem. My friend’s computersoftware was literally years out of date. The software needed for her to readher book edits was relying upon the features of a recent upgrade to do itsjob—features that didn’t exist anywhere on her system.For my friend, the options were simple. She could either spend the afternoondownloading and installing each previous version of the software, one by one, toincorporate all of the updates she’d missed over time, or she could buy along-overdue new computer that was completely up to date, with all of the latestsoftware. Knowing the way my friend thinks about sustainability and maintainingher electronics, I was not surprised by her choice. She opted to spend the dayupdating her trusty old computer.A NEW STORY ON AN OLD FOUNDATIONThe story of my friend and her outdated software is an analogy for what thescientific community is experiencing today when it comes to expanding thetheories of human evolution. When Darwin introduced his theory in 1859, it was aversion 1.0 way of thinking. As new technology became available over time,helping science make incredible new discoveries about molecular biology and thehuman genome, the theory should have been upgraded to v1.1, v1.2, and so on.But it wasn’t.The scientific method is based upon the principle of observation in individualresearch studies leading to “upgrades” in our common base of knowledge. Scienceis designed to be constantly updated and revised as new information comes tolight.What’s happened, however, is that the reluctance—even the outright resistance—ofthe academic and scientific communities to acknowledge new discoveries relatedto human development over the past 150 years is akin to my friend’s reluctanceto incorporate occasional upgrades into her computing system. Now, seemingly allof a sudden, discoveries such as the DNA fusion on human chromosome 2 arechanging the whole story. Trying to incorporate these types of discoveries intothe existing story of evolution is like trying to download an entirely newversion of software onto a computer that can’t support it. The v2.0 DNAdiscoveries are so different from the original concept of evolution that there’sno place for them. The v1.0 theory just doesn’t fit the facts.My friend attempted to do just what the scientific community is attempting to dotoday: to make an effort to somehow “fix” the existing software system on hercomputer so that it would accommodate additions. My friend discovered, however,that there’s a point of no return when it comes to computers and the softwarethey can support. The software that’s written for a computer is directly linkedto the nuts and bolts of the machinery: the chips, processors, and capacitiesthey’re built for. When advanced software begins to ask for volumes of memory orprocessing speeds that are not supported by the existing hardware, the newsoftware can’t be used. Despite my friend’s best efforts to catch up to thelevel of the upgrades being offered to her, she was forced to invest in a newcomputer whose hardware could accommodate the latest versions of the softwareshe needed to do her job.This is precisely where we are when it comes to the story of human origins. Theattempt to incorporate the story of exact, rapid DNA mutations, such as the oneswe find on FOXP2 and human chromosome 2, into the existing story of the long,slow, and gradual process of evolution isn’t working. And it can’t, because thediscoveries that preceded it have been discounted in evolution theory. We’vereached the point of no return.Just as my friend’s trusty old computer, which had served her so well, reached apoint where it was obsolete, we’ve reached a point where the human story we’vetold ourselves in the past is now obsolete. Now it’s time for us to invest in anew theory that embraces the anomalous information scientists of the pastcouldn’t account for.Just as geneticists and biologists have had to shift their thinking toaccommodate the evidence from the Human Genome Project, and just as physicistshave had to update their theories to adapt to the most recent results of theMichelson-Morley experiment, we must make room for additional discoveries in thefuture that may upset some of the most cherished beliefs of our current leadingthinkers. In a beautiful and perhaps unintentional way, it seems that sciencehas already given us everything we need to do just that. The building blocks forthe human story v2.0 already exist. It’s all about how we choose to embrace whatthe evidence has already revealed.AN UPGRADE FOR THE HUMAN STORYIn a way that is similar to the outcome of the Human Genome Project, the veryscience that was expected to eventually support Darwin’s theory of evolution andsolve the mystery of our origin has now done just the opposite. New discoveriesare presenting unsettling implications that fly in the face of longstandingscientific tradition. Ironically, the evidence is leading us in a direction thatnow parallels some of our most ancient and cherished traditions about ourbeginning. For convenience, I’m including a condensed summary of the evidencedescribed in the previous chapters here as the building blocks for the new humanstory.Fact 1: The relationships shown on the conventional human evolutionary tree arespeculative connections only. While they are believed to exist and are taught asfactual in public schools, a 150-year search has failed to produce the physicalevidence that confirms the relationships depicted on the evolutionary familytree.Fact 2: If the fossil record is accurate, anatomically modern humans appeared onearth suddenly approximately 200,000 years ago with advanced features that setthem apart from every other form of life that had already developed to date orand has developed since. These features have remained unchanged in us andinclude: * A brain 50 percent larger than that of our nearest primate relative, the chimpanzee. * Upright posture and advanced manual dexterity. • The capacity for advanced language. * An extended neural network that allows for extraordinary capabilities, such as deep intuition and access to heart-based wisdom on demand.Fact 3: The lack of common DNA between AMHs and Neanderthals tells us that weanatomically modern humans did not descend from ancient Neanderthals. Additionalstudies reveal that our forbearers shared the earth with the Neanderthals thatwere previously thought to be some of our ancestors. Logically, if we shared theearth with them, we could not have descended from them.Fact 4: DNA analysis reveals that: * The DNA that sets us apart from other primates is the result of a mysterious process of “fusion” that resulted in the second-largest chromosome in the human body: human chromosome 2. * The way human chromosome 2 was fused suggests something beyond evolution has made our humanness possible: the “turning off” or removal of overlapping functions, and the fact that it happened quickly, rather than slowly over a long period of time.Armed with these four facts alone, we have more than enough reasons to rethinkthe traditional story of who we are. Clearly we’re not the product of anevolutionary process, at least not the kind of evolution that Charles Darwin hadin mind when he proposed his original theory in the 19th century. Looking at thescientific probability that the DNA that gives us our humanness occurred bychance, the odds of which have been compared to the odds of a junkyard tornadocreating an airplane, points to the conclusion that we humans are not the resultof random events set into motion by pure chance.The question now is simply this: Are we willing to embrace what the best scienceof our era is showing us? If we answer yes, then we must also embrace a newhuman story that better reflects the evidence we’ve compiled. And while modernscience is struggling with what the new evidence means and how it fits into thestory of our origin, the indigenous people of the earth and practitioners ofsome of the most widely accepted spiritual traditions of the world are not. Intheir way of thinking, the modern evidence simply reconfirms and deepens theiracceptance of the ancient accounts that are at the core of their beliefs.With over half of the world professing to follow one of the three majorreligions that stem from a common history—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—it’sno surprise that the new scientific evidence is so well received by so much ofthe world.ANCIENT ACCOUNTS OF AN INTENTIONAL ORIGINAlmost universally, scriptures from the world’s most ancient and cherishedspiritual traditions agree that we humans are linked to something beyondourselves and our immediate surroundings. And as different as these traditionsare from one another, when it comes to the story of human origins their accountsare also surprisingly similar. Common themes include: * An advanced intelligence and an intentional act being responsible for our origin. * The use of the terms they or angels (in the ancient tongues the authors spoke) when describing human creation suggest that a group intelligence was involved. * Descriptions explaining that we are the product of the dust/clay/soil of our planet being fused with an essence that is not from this world. * In the three Abrahamic traditions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, it is the dust or clay of the earth that is used to create the first body of a human being. * Following the formation of the first human body, for example, life is “breathed” into the nostrils of the person and the blood of a being of higher intelligence is mixed with the first person’s body.In great detail, the ancient traditions took extra care to describe the intimatenature of our creation and how we, like our first ancestors, are infused withwhat has been described as a special spark of a mysterious essence, eternallyjoining us with one another and with something we can’t see that exists beyondour physical world.While these details have been largely edited out of contemporary versions of theChristian Bible, ancient Hebrew literature, such as the Haggadah and certain“lost” scrolls, shows that this level of detail was intended in the originaltexts. It’s this mystical spark, which science so far has yet to find ways tomeasure, that sets us apart from all other forms of life on earth.The following are a few key examples of ancient stories that illustrate thecommon elements of story I am referencing.The Sumerian creation story. The region that is now the country of Iraq was thesite of ancient Sumer, traditionally thought to be the oldest civilization onearth. (New discoveries at sites of other early civilizations, such as Turkey’sGöbekli Tepe, show that these sites may prove to be equally as old or older.)The Sumerian creation story was recorded on a stone tablet found in southeasternIraq, in what was the ancient city of Nippur.According to the creation story, known by archaeologists as the Eridu Genesis,Nippur is where the first human was created. The story describes a time whenmultiple gods ruled over the earth. For reasons that are detailed in the text,one of the gods was sacrificed, and his blood was mixed with clay to create thefirst human. An excerpt tells the story:In clay, god and manShall be bound,To a unity brought together;So that to the end of daysThe Flesh and the SoulWhich in a god have ripened—That soul in a blood-kinship be bound.12 [endnotes.xhtml#fn104]In other words, this story suggests that we are the product of an intentionalact that was overseen by advanced human-like beings, imbuing all of us withcertain qualities that the gods placed into the new human.The first human in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. Among therecurring themes of ancient creation stories are descriptions of human origin atthe hands of more advanced and otherworldly beings. The oral traditions of theHebrew Mid-rash and early Kabbalah, for example, describe how the creator askedhis angels:Go and fetch me dust from the four corners of the earth, and I will create mantherewith.13 [endnotes.xhtml#fn105]In similar terms, the holy Quran refers to God’s creation of humankind fromnatural elements:We created you out of dust.14 [endnotes.xhtml#fn106]At another point in the Quran, however, the birth of man is attributed to God,acting through fluid.It is He [God] who has created man from water.15 [endnotes.xhtml#fn107]While these last two descriptions may appear to be in conflict, a closer look atthe verses resolves the mystery. In the first description, the story of Adamoriginating from dust is part of a larger sequence describing the events thatled to the first living beings. The verses reveal that after Adam’s origin asdust, there was a process of creating progressively more lifelike forms as thefirst human began to take shape. The description states that after the dust, thehuman was formed froma small life-germ, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, complete in makeand incomplete, that We may make clear to you.16 [endnotes.xhtml#fn108]In this way, the Quran adds to the traditional descriptions of Adam’s creationby filling in details of how “dust” becomes flesh.In a similar way, in the Western world, when we ask someone what the first humanon earth was made of, the reply is generally that we’re made of the same “stuff”that the world is made of: clay, mud, or dust. To support such statements, weare often directed to the biblical creation story in the book of Genesis. Sharedby nearly two billion people of the Jewish and Christian traditions, the storyof Adam provides the most basic description of human origin. Deceptively simplein its form, Genesis recounts the miracle of human creation through a very fewsimple words.The Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth.17 [endnotes.xhtml#fn109]The Mayan creation story. From approximately 250 C.E. until 900 C.E., the Mayancivilization flourished across a vast area of North America, extending from whatis now northern Mexico to the south, encompassing the entire Yucatán Peninsulaand what are now the countries of Belize and Guatemala, as well as portions ofHonduras and El Salvador. The Mayan civilization is recognized as one of the six“cradles of civilization” that appear to have developed in different places onthe earth, at different times, independently of one another. The remaining fiveare Mesopotamia, and the civilizations of the Nile River, the Indus River, theYellow River, and the central Andes of Peru.18 [endnotes.xhtml#fn110]The ancient Mayans had a complex system of mathematics and hieroglyphic writing,an advanced knowledge of cosmic cycles, and a well-developed creation story.It’s known today as the Popol Vuh, and it describes the theme of human creationin a way that is very similar to the story told in some of the original Semiticscriptures. The Popol Vuh tells us that the first attempt at human creation wasflawed. Subsequent attempts led to a refinement of the creation process.The point I’m making here is that the Mayans, with an advanced knowledge of thecosmos (which was confirmed only in the mid-20th century) attributed theirexistence to a conscious process invoked by an already-existing intelligencerather than a spontaneous and random process of nature. The Popol Vuhdescription begins:Together they made a body, but it wasn’t right. . . . We must try again.19[endnotes.xhtml#fn111]The previous examples are only a sampling of elements common to many ancient andindigenous accounts of human origins. Although these accounts vary in theirspecifics, the general themes are remarkably consistent. They tell us that weare: 1. The product of an intentional act 2. As such, related to the greater existence of a cosmic family 3. Imbued with the traits of our creator(s)These are precisely the themes that the theory of evolution, in its currentform, cannot account for.Key 22: Almost universally, ancient and indigenous traditions attribute ourorigins to the result of a conscious and intentional act.EVOLUTION? CREATIONISM? OR . . . ?The thinking of the past has been binary when it comes to the question of ourorigins. If evolution is not our story, the go-to alternative has automaticallybeen assumed to be the story told by creationists of a divine beginning similarto the biblical account. With this kind of thinking, all the “baggage” ofreligious doctrine from the creationism side of the issue, and all the “baggage”of the science zealots who are clinging to fundamentalist evolutionary theory,has made it nearly impossible to explore a third possibility. Nevertheless, DNAstudies are telling us that a third possibility exists.The scientific fact of the mutation that made our FOXP2 gene and complex speechpossible, and the DNA fusion that created human chromosome 2 and enabled theadvanced brain functions associated with it, as well as the evidence thatsuggests these mutations cannot be attributed to evolution alone, all invite usto consider something beyond creationism and evolution when it comes to ourspecies’ origin. For the purposes of this discussion, and to honor the fact thatmutations did occur, while acknowledging that something more than evolutioncontributed to the mutations, let’s call our third possibility directedmutation.The name says it all. Some force that is not presently accounted for in thescientific story is responsible for the precision, timing, and refining of themutations that makes us who we are. That unknown force directed the mutationsthat science has now proven to exist. And while the phrase directed mutation isaccurate in terms of what it describes, it also opens the door to the obviousquestion of who, or what, did the directing.Of course, to even consider the possibility of directed mutation leads us into arealm historically reserved for religious explanations of our existence, or morerecently, to extraterrestrial explanations that are beyond the purview ofscience—at least as we know science today. Because science is based inunderstanding nature and the many expressions of the natural world, asupernatural explanation of human origins by definition must lie beyond natureand scientific understanding.My sense, as a scientist, is that the possibility of directed mutation is bothbeyond Darwin’s theory and beyond creationism. Rather than requiring asupernatural explanation, the evidence, I believe, is leading us directly to anew and expanded understanding of the natural world and nature itself. This newunderstanding seems to hold the potential to catapult us light-years beyond thelimited views of how we came to be that we’ve embraced in the past. In otherwords, through our willingness to embrace the deepest truths of our origins wemay, at last, unlock the deepest mysteries of the cosmos and know our place init.This path of inquiry leads to what some scientists have called a Pandora’s boxof possibilities—once the box has been opened, the contents cannot be stuffedback inside. From the mystery of what makes us human, beyond the small number ofgenes discovered by the Human Genome Project, to the mystery of the mutationsthat resulted in the FOXP2 gene and human chromosome 2, the new human story isleading us to embrace an explanation for how our forbearers came to beanatomically modern—built just like us—that’s beyond the pure chance of luckygenes and random mutations.Our willingness to embrace the third option of directed mutation puts ussquarely into the realm of unmeasured fields and unseen forces, and an unseenintelligence that science has been reluctant to consider in the past. And thisis where the sea change begins when it comes to the scientific answer to Who arewe? When we allow for new interpretations of the existing evidence, the newconclusions that emerge can only serve to empower us with new possibilities whenit comes to the way we think about ourselves and our potential. It can also giveus new perspectives on the way we live our lives and solve our problems. Perhapsmost importantly, it has the potential to change our sense of self-worth and ourappreciation for the value of all human life.Just as we devote hours of time today to searching dusty archives and genealogywebsites to tell us about our family’s past so we can understand ourselves asindividuals, I believe that we also long to connect with the deeper truth ofwhere we’ve come from as humans. We feel a greater sense of belonging and oftena sense of pride when we explore our lineages and learn the things our ancestorsaccomplished and overcame to make our lives possible today. And that same senseof pride and belonging arises when we discover that our lives are the result ofa conscious act of directed mutation.I’ve spoken with biologists, anthropologists, and others in the scientificcommunity regarding precisely the evidence that I’ve shared in the previouschapters and its implications. Their response has become predictable. At first,when they hear my suggestion that evolution is not our scientific origin story,they think I’m joking. Later, when they realize that I’m completely seriousabout what I’m suggesting, the tone of the conversation and the expression ontheir faces changes. Some people become aggressive and indignant. They take thepossibility personally and ask why, as their friend, I would work to underminetheir decades of teaching and their reputations.Others, often in the same conversation, become quiet and withdraw. In private,they sometimes tell me that they’ve known this conversation was coming; theyjust didn’t know when. It had to come, they tell me, because discoveries thatwere once classified as anomalies have continued to accumulate so quickly thatit’s clear science took the wrong path when it comes to solving the mystery ofour origin. At the foundation of the newly emerging story of human life isanother story that is unfolding, on the grand scale of the universe itself, thatdescribes a different kind of life.THINKING “DEAD” IN A LIVING UNIVERSEFor over 300 years, the scientific story of the origin of our universe has ledus to believe that we live in a “dead” universe. From this perspective, thecosmos is made of inert stuff, like the dust of exploded stars or debris fromcolliding asteroids and disintegrated planets. In a dead universe, there is nopoint to life and no reason for living. But new discoveries by leading-edgeresearchers are giving us very good reasons to rethink the dead universe story,which means there may be a purpose to life after all.At the forefront of defining how the new scientific paradigm of a livinguniverse may affect us in our daily lives is social researcher Duane Elgin.Elgin’s philosophy, based upon existing evidence in the scientific community,accepts that the universe is a living entity that’s growing and evolving ratherthan a lifeless system. He shows us that the way we think of the universe andour place in it is at the very foundation of the way we live our lives and solveour problems, especially how we treat one another.If it were true that we live in a dead universe, then it would actually makesense to do what we’ve already done in the past, which is to exploit everyresource available to the highest degree possible and reap the rewards of thoseresources. In Elgin’s words, we relate to our belief that we’re in a nonlivinguniverse “by taking advantage of that which is dead on behalf of the living.Consumerism and exploitation are natural outcomes of a dead universeperspective.”20 [endnotes.xhtml#fn112] This is how humanity has been living upto now, with rare exceptions.It’s no coincidence that Elgin’s description of consumerism and exploitationreflects the world that we find ourselves in today. Just as the theory ofevolution led us to believe that human life is the result of chance events,we’ve also been led to think of the universe as a resource that’s ours todominate and exploit.The problem with this mind-set is that, ultimately, it has led to the depletionof natural resources, unsustainable forms of food production, and the conflictsover scarce resources that are at the root of so much suffering today.But Elgin believes that we are part of a living system, and that knowing thetruth will change how we relate to one another and lead us toward a moresustainable lifestyle of cooperation. The parallels that exist throughout theuniverse, in every known living system, lend credence to this view. Frommicrobes and neural networks to ecosystems and the behavior of entirepopulations, all living systems, regardless of their size, show characteristicsdemonstrating the sharing of energy and information. In support of his theory,Elgin describes how the universe is: * Completely unified and able to communicate with itself instantaneously in nonlocal ways that transcend the limits of the speed of light * Sustained by the flow-through of an unimaginably vast amount of energy * Free at its deepest, quantum levels21 [endnotes.xhtml#fn113]While Elgin is quick to admit that these traits in and of themselves don’t meanthat we are part of a living universe, he notes that each fact adds to a growingbody of information that supports this theory.22 [endnotes.xhtml#fn114] Byextrapolation, as living beings we are part of this exchange of energy andinformation. Our existence has a purpose that is greater than paying our billson time.Key 23: A growing body of evidence suggests that we exist as part of a livingand vibrant universe rather than one simply made of inert dust, gas, and emptyspace.IN A LIVING UNIVERSE, LIFE HAS A PURPOSEIn a universe that’s alive, it makes sense that living systems would appearoften and in many ways. It makes sense because life itself is the force that’sdriving the system. To discover that we exist as living beings within thecontext of an even larger living system implies that our lives are aboutsomething more than simply being born, enjoying a few years on earth, and dying.It implies that somewhere, underlying everything we know and see, our lives havepurpose.And this is where our story takes us beyond the realm of proven science.Key 24: If we’re the result of something more than pure chance, then it makessense that our lives are about more than purely surviving. It implies that ourlives have purpose.As a society, we now find ourselves at a meeting point of two ways of thinkingabout ourselves and the universe we live in. Elgin’s living universe offers usthe big picture of life having a purpose from the top down—from the macro scaleof the universe itself as a living entity, within which, at the micro scale, theliving cells that make up our bodies express themselves. The discoveries thatI’ve shared in this book offer the evidence from the bottom up—from the microworld of mutated DNA yielding more complex expressions of life within the macrocontext of Elgin’s living universe.When we consider the universe as something that’s alive, it changes everything.Elgin’s words offer a beautiful sense of that perspective.In a living universe, our physical existence is permeated and sustained by analiveness that is inseparable from the larger universe. Seeing ourselves as partof the unbroken fabric of creation awakens our sense of connection with, andcompassion for, the totality of life. We recognize our bodies as precious,biodegradable vehicles for acquiring ever-deepening experiences of aliveness.23[endnotes.xhtml#fn115]Herein we may find our answer to the question of life’s purpose. The existenceof a living universe tells us that we are part of the world around us, and notseparate from it, and that our aliveness is part of a greater aliveness. And asthe very goal of life in the universe is to grow, change, and perpetuate itself,these are precisely the qualities that we should strive to embrace throughoutthe course of our time in this world as human beings.Through each experience we face in life—through the satisfactions and thefrustrations of every job, through the ecstasy and the heartbreak of eachintimate relationship, through the unspeakable joy of bringing a child into thisworld or the unbearable pain of losing a child, through the choice to takeanother human life and the ability to save a life, through each war that wecreate and every time we end a war—in all of these experiences and so many more,we learn to know ourselves better as individuals and as a species.On an unspoken, possibly subconscious level, we may be creating precisely theseexperiences in order to push ourselves to the very edge of what we believe istrue about us and what’s possible in life. And each time we push ourselves toour edge and grow, we discover that there’s more to know. We get to experienceour aliveness and relish it if we choose.This is the very definition of a living universe and our role in it. Our livesand lifetimes are our way of infusing the essence of our unique experience intoan already living and extremely diverse entity. Perhaps Ray Bradbury says itbest:We are the miracle of force and matter making itself over into imagination andwill. Incredible. The life force experimenting with forms. You for one. Me foranother. The universe has shouted itself alive. We are one of the shouts.24[endnotes.xhtml#fn116]Within the limits that science has placed upon itself today, there is no directway to know the purpose of life with certainty. Indirectly, however, the answerto the question of life’s purpose may be hidden in plain sight. We may discoverthat the very existence of our advanced capabilities—our intuition, sympathy,empathy, and compassion—holds the key to solving this mystery.Albert Einstein’s work in science led him to precisely this conclusion. As isthe case with so many scientists who strive to unlock the deepest mysteries ofour existence, the deeper their discoveries take them, the more they recognizethat there’s something more to human existence than a sterile and meaninglessuniverse would produce by accident. When Einstein was asked about the meaning ofour lives, his response was elegant. I’ve included a relatively long excerpt ofEinstein’s thoughts to give context to the answer that I’ve italicized.A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the “Universe,” a partlimited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings assomething separate from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of hisconsciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to ourpersonal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task mustbe to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion toembrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody isable to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is initself a part of the liberation, and a foundation for inner security (author’semphasis).25 [endnotes.xhtml#fn117]The beauty of Einstein’s statement is that it transcends numbers, statistics,and logic. It’s a purely intuitive answer to a serious scientific question. It’salso a perfect example of how advances in modern science have carried us to theedge of what science can tell us with certainty. There’s a place—an unspokenboundary—where the nuts and bolts of scientific explanation fail when it comesto describing life. They do so because we’re more than cells, flesh, and bones.There’s a quality to human life that simply cannot be defined in purelyscientific terms, as we know science today. And it’s that quality thatpotentially can lead us to comprehend the deepest truths of our existence.For the scientific community to embrace the fact that evolution can no longer beour story, they say, would be like a wrecking ball appearing one day andleveling 150 years of exploration and hard work as well as lifetimes of teachingthat the work has created. I can certainly see why some people would think thisway. No one wants to see the foundation of his or her life’s work demolished.But I can also see something very different happening. As important as scienceis in the world today, as we push the boundary of scientific knowledge to thevery edge of its capacity to define the world, we discover the limit of itscapacity to serve us. And this is where science, as we know it today, breaksdown. There are qualities of human life that simply cannot be measured anddefined.SCIENCE CAN’T MEASURE THE CAPACITY TO LOVEIn some respects we may think too highly of science. We may give too much creditto what we believe science can accomplish. Maybe we’ve put science and thescientific method on such a high pedestal that we simply assume science eitheralready has the answers, or that it has the potential to solve the deepestmysteries of life, such as our individual life purpose. And if this is the case,it may be because we are asking too much of science when it comes to thequestion Who are we?The German philosopher Karl Jaspers reminds us of this when he says, “The limitsof science have always been the source of bitter disappointment when peopleexpected something from science that it was not able to provide.”26[endnotes.xhtml#fn118]The “bitter disappointment” that Jaspers is describing may be precisely thesource of the frustration that we see in the scientific community when it comesto reconciling new discoveries with the existing theory of human origins. We maybe asking science to do something that it cannot do and was never designed todo. I say this because of the nature of science itself. Science can only tell ushow the molecules of our bodies behave now and how they have behaved in thepast. But science can’t tell us why those molecules appeared to begin with.One of the reasons science is incapable of providing this answer is becausescientific information is based upon events that are either observed in natureor duplicated in the laboratory to prove a theory. The fact is that no oneliving today witnessed the moment when the first human life appeared on earth.And in the laboratory, the process that would make such an awesome eventpossible has never been reproduced.Although there are written accounts of human creation linked to religioustraditions, made long after the fact, there is no firsthand record of the actualmoment of human creation existing today—except for the creation itself: us. Ifwe’re going to solve the “why” of our origin in a living universe, we must lookbeyond the process of how we’ve arrived at our place today and instead considerwhat we’ve gained from our journey.To do so may not be as difficult as it sounds. The clues that lead us to know ifthere’s a purpose for living may be readily accessible within each of us, wherethey have always been. They live within each of us in the extraordinaryabilities our genetic makeup gives us and in the way our expanded neural networkof heart-brain communication empowers us.Key 25: Our capacity for deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, compassion, and theself-healing that allows us to live long enough to share these capacities, arethe needle of a compass that points us directly to our life purpose.No other form of life on earth has the capacity to love selflessly, to embracechange by choice in a healthy way, to self-heal, to self-regulate longevity, orto activate the immune response on demand. And no other form of life has thecapacity to experience deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, and ultimately,compassion, all of which are expressions of love—and to do so on demand. Theseuniquely human experiences are telling us that our lives have purpose, and thepurpose is simply to embrace these abilities in order to know ourselves in theirpresence."},{"pageContent":"image [images/img-135-1.png]contents.xhtml#toc8"},{"pageContent":"chapter five [contents.xhtml#toc9]image [images/img-137-1.png]WE’RE “WIRED” FOR CONNECTION [contents.xhtml#toc9]Awakening Our Powers of Intuition, Empathy, and Compassion [contents.xhtml#toc9]“The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we’re alone.”— MITCH ALBOM (1958–), AMERICAN AUTHOR AND JOURNALISTHave you ever had one of those moments where you suddenly seem to be at one withthe whole universe? One minute you’re going about the mundane routines ofeveryday life, and an instant later, you unexpectedly find yourself in completeand total harmony with all life, all people, and the whole world. Maybe you weresitting in your car or truck at a stoplight, waiting for the light to changefrom red to green. Or maybe you were just staring out your car window as youwaited to pick up your children after school.Regardless of the scenario, it’s generally when you’re not focused on anythingin particular that “it” happens. It’s while you’re between thoughts and notfocused on anything specific that a feeling wells up from deep inside of you.Maybe your body floods with warmth. Maybe you get goose bumps on your arms or aprickle on the back of your neck. Then, suddenly, it’s as if the veil betweenthe worlds cracks wide open and you’re given a front-row seat to viewing themeaning of your life, receiving answers to all your questions and clearly seeingthe roadmap to fulfill your destiny.And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ends. The light turns green. Thedriver behind you leans on the horn, urging you to cross the intersection. Andpoof! Just like that, the clarity of what you saw only seconds beforeevaporates. It’s gone! And you’re left to focus on the world of the guy honkingbehind you and what you’ll make for dinner. You’re also left wondering whereyour clear insight into the meaning of life has gone.CONNECTED WITH EVERYTHING EVERYWHEREWhile the previous scenario may be a bit of an exaggeration, it’s probably notthat much of one. We’ve all had moments of crystal clarity when we feel thatwe’re “in the zone.” We feel that we’re just where we’re supposed to be, at justthe time that we’re supposed to be there, in perfect harmony and attuned to theworld. It can feel timeless when we’re in the zone, because we’re not thinkingabout anything. And that’s the key. The moment we begin to analyze ourexperience, the zone collapses. It does so because when we think, we’re joltedfrom the natural “go-to” place for our awareness when we’re not thinking aboutanything—the heart—to the place where it takes an effort to maintain ourfocus—the mind.The zone that gives us a feeling of connection, confidence, all-knowing, andpeace is a natural state of being that we know as intuition, which begins in ourhearts. Heart-based intuition bypasses the conventional reason and logic of thethinking brain. It taps into something that’s deeper and more ancient thanabstract reasoning, and yet, for most people, intuition has a familiar feeling.When we think about it, this familiarity should come as no surprise. Intuitionis the internal language that our bodies have used to communicate with us sincebirth. We feel in our cells long before we ever learn to speak with our voices.And because we do, it makes perfect sense that this most primal form ofcommunication—intuitive feeling—would be the language that our body uses tocommunicate vital messages regarding trust, safety, and survival.The previous examples of times when we experience harmony and connectednessunintentionally, while doing nothing in particular, illustrate a specific kindof intuition: spontaneous intuition. This is the kind of intuition that comeswhen it wants to. It’s also the kind that seems to leave when it wantsto—usually before we’re ready. The question is, can we trigger this powerfulform of intuition intentionally when we need it the most? How can we triggerdeep intuition on demand?THE IMPULSE TO CONNECTSometimes our flashes of spontaneous intuition show up in simple ways, such aswhen we pick up the telephone to call a friend or loved one only to discoverthat they’re already on the line that we were dialing. There was a time in mylife when I experienced this kind of intuition with my mom. We had a standingritual for a phone call every Sunday. From wherever I was in the world, I woulddo my best to call Mom, catch up on what had happened in her life during theweek, and share with her what had happened in mine.Following her divorce from my father in the mid-1960s, my mom chose to livealone. Our physical visits were few and far between and it was the weekly phonecalls that kept us in touch. There was a mystery that would often occur duringthose Sunday phone calls that illustrates the kind of intuition I’m describingin this chapter. I would pick up the receiver with the intention of dialingMom’s number, only to hear her voice already on the line without the phone evereven ringing.“Hi!” she’d say. “This is Mom.”“I know,” I’d answer. “I was just going to dial your number, but you’re alreadyhere.”She was less surprised than I was by the whole thing, and more playful.“See,” she’d say. “We’re just connected—psychic! Our ESP is working today!”We’d laugh, and it was always a great way to begin our weekly catch up.I’m sharing Mom’s story here to illustrate a point. The connection between twopeople that makes such a simultaneous phone call possible, such as I had with mymom, is not the product of a conscious thought. It’s not about making anappointment on a planner to call on a certain day at a certain time. In fact,it’s almost impossible to create such a deep connection consciously. It’s thethinking process of when and where to place such a call that creates theinterference, preventing the intuitive connection from happening.When I pick up the phone to call my mom, the moment that I do, it’s in responseto a subconscious cue. It’s more of a feeling that it’s the time to call, ratherthan the thought Now is the time to make my call. I’ll be going about my typicaldaily routines and suddenly have an impulse—an intuitive hit or urge—to pick upthe phone and make the call at precisely the instant that I do. And it’s becauseI’m responding to an intuitive cue that it’s not uncommon for my mom to be onthe line already. The intuition that I feel to place the call is in response toher anticipation that we’re about to connect. If I were to think about makingthe call, and actually do so even a second sooner or later, I’d lose the momentand never make the intuitive connection with my mom.When it comes to intuitive experiences in our lives, almost immediately wediscover two universal themes: * The impulse to connect is generally not a conscious thought. * The mutual impulse for connection appears spontaneously when we’re not looking for it or expecting it.IS IT INTUITION OR INSTINCT?After we experience a deep intuitive connection in our lives such as the wisdomthat appears at a stoplight or the phone connection I shared with my mom, andthe experience ends, questions arise: Will it ever happen again? And if so,when? Do we simply wait for the universe to tap us on the shoulder, hoping thatthe next intuitive experience will be available for us when we need it, or isthere more to it than that? Are we somehow empowered to open our intuitiveconnections when we want them?These are good questions. And as different as they may appear from one another,the answer to each question is found in the same place. It’s all about how weexperience intuition for ourselves. The word intuition itself means differentthings to different people.So let’s begin at the beginning. What is intuition, and how does it show up inour lives?image [images/img-141-1.png]Intuition is direct knowing that results from the way we receive sensual,conscious, and subconscious perceptions. As mentioned previously, the key hereis that our intuition isn’t based in reasoning. Rather, it’s a subconsciousassessment of the present moment based upon factors that may include streetsmarts, personal experience, and our physical senses, as well as instinct, in away that gives us an awareness that is not thought out logically. Through ourintuition, we can draw upon these factors and process them quickly withouttaking the time to actually think about them. This awareness is sometimesdescribed as the soul’s compass, because it helps us know what’s right and truefor us in a given moment. American author Dean Koontz describes this sense wellby stating, “Intuition is seeing with the soul.”1 [endnotes.xhtml#fn119]There is a difference between experiencing intuition and the related phenomenonof instinct. Instinct is nature’s way of informing us quickly of what’s best forus and how to react in the present moment through responses that are “preset” or“hardwired” in our subconscious minds. Our instincts are based upon experiencesof the past. And while the past that’s informing us can sometimes be our ownpersonal past, it can also include the collective past of our ancestors’response to a similar situation. When something has been experienced many timesby many people, it becomes deeply ingrained in the collective psyche.An example of this would be a child’s innate fear of being left alone in agrocery store aisle, even if only for a few seconds, while the child’s mother orfather steps away to grab a can of soup. In the brief instant that children lookaround and realize their parent is gone, more often than not their response ispredictable. It’s common for them to cry in distress, or even to scream interror at the realization that they’re suddenly alone.What makes this example so telling is that children may, in fact, be sensingvery real dangers, even though they’ve never had a bad experience in the past tojustify their fears. When something like this happens, there’s a good chancethat the child’s fear is based upon instinct.Our instinctive responses are based upon the collective experience of manypeople, over the course of many generations, who’ve learned, as in the precedingexample, that it’s safer to be with others in a familiar environment than to bealone in a strange one. The child’s fear is a shared primal instinct for safetyand survival kicking in on a subconscious level.Typically our instincts don’t take into account the factors of personalknowledge and experience that can influence a subconscious response. Ourinstincts may tell us, for example, that we need to lash out and defendourselves against friends or co-workers that we feel have attacked us throughtheir criticism. Whether we’re feeling threatened by the tip of a flint spearfrom an intruder in our cave 10,000 years ago or experiencing the “spear tip” ofhurtful criticism from someone we know today, the instinct is the same—when wefeel attacked, we react quickly and forcefully to defend ourselves. In the samesituation, however, intuition may tell us that a softer, measured response ismore appropriate.Because our intuition is taking into account additional factors beyond ourhardwired instincts, we can respond in a more thoughtful and less hurtful way.An example of this would be our personal history with the person criticizing us,the knowledge that they genuinely care about us, for example, and that what weperceived as a personal attack was really intended as constructive criticism. Insuch a scenario, the instinct to defend ourselves is still present, but we havethe intuitive wisdom to temper our response. We can let the friend or co-workerknow we feel attacked by their criticism without counterattacking in a hurtfulway. Tailoring our response to the moment in this way has the potential to saveus from doing irreparable damage to our relationship.Key 26: Intuition is a real-time assessment that draws upon personal and pastexperience, sensory cues, and street smarts, while instinct is a response thatis “hardwired” into our subconscious as a survival mechanism.KNOWING THE DIFFERENCEWhile we may not recall our own childhood response to being left alone, asadults we commonly find ourselves in situations where our instincts tell us thatsomething isn’t right and we may be in danger. The uneasy feeling we get whilewe’re walking down a dark street in an unfamiliar neighborhood at 1 A.M. is aperfect example. Although we may have never personally had a bad experiencewalking down any dark street late at night anywhere in the world, other peoplehave. In addition to the street smarts that may relate to a specific street orpart of town, our instinctive fear is largely a subconscious response based uponthe accumulated experiences of many humans walking in the same conditions ofdark streets, late at night, for hundreds of generations.Similar to the way it can be scary for a child to be alone in a strange place,dark streets often meant trouble for those walking them alone in the past, andwe have the same concerns today. It’s under the cover of night, when fewerpeople are on the streets, for example, that it’s easier to be surprised bysomeone with bad intentions. When we’re faced with walking alone down a darkstreet late at night, our instincts wake up to remind us of our collectiveexperience and to prepare us for the possibility of a similar experience in thepresent moment.I’m making the distinction between intuition and instinct here because of theway intuition happens. Rather than reacting exclusively from a library of pastexperiences, when our intuition kicks in, it informs us of what’s true now, inthe present moment. It can do so quickly, in real time, because it doesn’t needto sift through the filters of all the experiences of dark streets in ourcollective past or the latest newspaper accounts of local crimes. Our intuitionbegins in our hearts—specifically with the little brain in our hearts. This is acollection of specialized cells that think, feel, and remember independently ofthe brains in our heads or our gut instincts.Our intuitive responses and instincts can sometimes contradict one another, andit’s easy to become confused when they’re pointing us in different directions atthe same time. While instinct may be telling us the darkness of the street sceneisn’t safe, the heart may be telling us that on this particular street, in thisparticular moment, we are safe. So what are we to do in such an experience? Howdo we know which voice is from the gut and which one is from the heart—and whichone to follow?While we all experience instinct and intuition on an almost daily basis, wediscover our greatest levels of self-mastery when we can discern one fromanother and reconcile them in our lives. To do so we need a clear understandingof precisely where intuition comes from.THE SINGLE EYE OF THE HEARTPart of my heritage is Cherokee, from America’s Southeast. In the Cherokeelanguage, there is a term for the intuition that already exists within each ofus beyond logic and reason: chante ishta, which is pronounced “shawn-tayeesh-ta.” Just as the Sanskrit word prana has no equivalent in the Englishlanguage and must be translated loosely as “life force,” chante ishta has nodirect translation. An approximation of its meaning is “single eye of the heart”or “one eye of the heart.”Chante ishta is information that comes from the heart’s natural wisdom. Anotherway of saying this is that intuition is a knowing made possible through thespecialized cells that form the secondary brain in the heart. Our heart’s cellsare wired to sense the present moment and inform us about our immediateenvironment. And while our brains may listen in and respond to what our heartcells detect, they don’t necessarily have to do so.We have the ability to listen to the heart’s wisdom independently of the brainand our instinctive and learned responses. The key is to avoid filtering theinformation that we’re receiving from the heart through a subconscious libraryof instincts. The value of such wisdom is that it offers us a clear perspectiveon people’s actions, life events, and situations that is beyond the polaritiesof judgment, beyond bias, and beyond fear.THE WISE USE OF POWERThe heart has no knowledge of rules of social conduct or the legalitiesestablished by local and federal legislators. It doesn’t know about therightness or wrongness of culture, society, politics, and political correctness.The single eye of the heart knows only what’s true for you in a given moment intime. It offers you a point of reference when there’s no one to ask or turn towhen you’re faced with a difficult choice in your life. In doing so the wisdomof your heart offers you an unfiltered, uncensored, unbiased report of yourimmediate situation.That being said, there is a responsibility that comes with anything thatempowers us in life. When it comes to the power of heart wisdom, ourresponsibility is to use our power wisely, with common sense, in a way that ishonoring to ourselves and kind to others. What I’m saying here is that theheart’s intuition can be a useful guide in life, but it is not the basis for alife manual of rigid rules that we become enslaved by.It’s up to you to apply what your heart tells you wisely, balancing yourintuition in a healthy and responsible way that makes sense under thecircumstances of the moment.THE SCIENCE OF INTUITIONMany of the recent discoveries regarding intuition and what it means in ourlives have been made by scientists at the Institute of HeartMath. Similar to theconclusions reached by scientists early in the 20th century, what modern IHMstudies suggest is that the function of our hearts is much deeper and much moresubtle than has been previously recognized.If we can understand the conditions in the body that support intuition, then wecan re-create those conditions when we choose, rather than waiting for them tohappen occasionally and randomly, as with my mom’s phone calls. Fortunately,after two decades of investigation, researchers at IHM have developed thetechniques to help us do precisely that. A study they performed in 2007 providedsome of the first scientific evidence regarding what happens in our hearts andour brains during intuitive moments and suggests how we can re-create thoseconditions intentionally.The purpose of the IHM study was to investigate one of the strongest emotionalconnections known to exist: the intuitive bond between mother and child. Basedupon previous findings showing that “signals generated by the heart have thecapacity to affect others around us,”2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn120] in this particularstudy monitors were used to measure both the mother’s brain waves (as aconventional EEG) and the baby’s heartbeat (as a conventional ECG, sometimesknown as an EKG) while the mother held the baby in her lap. The prediction wasthat the interaction between the electrical fields of the baby’s heart and themother’s brain would alert the woman to her baby’s needs.3[endnotes.xhtml#fn121]At first, the influence of the baby’s heartbeat was undetectable in the mother’sbrain. However, when the mother was asked to shift her attention and focusspecifically upon her baby, the wave pattern in her brain changed in a profoundand unexpected way. When the mother focused her attention on her baby, theheartbeat of her baby was mirrored within her brainwaves. The study concludedthat the intentional act of shifting her awareness to her baby made the mothermore sensitive and attuned to the electromagnetic signals of her baby’s heart.4[endnotes.xhtml#fn122]While this study has meaning for many areas of our lives, the reason I’m sharingit here is best summarized in the words of the scientists themselves: “Thesefindings have intriguing implications, suggesting that a mother in apsychophysiologically coherent state became more sensitive to the subtleelectromagnetic information encoded in the electromagnetic signals of herinfant.”5 [endnotes.xhtml#fn123] Coherence can be defined as an energeticharmony that is established as an electrical signal between two organs in thebody—in this case, between the mother’s heart and her brain.Continuing studies by IHM and other research institutions now suggest that thekind of intuitive connection demonstrated by the mother and her baby can beexpanded to include our ability to attune our brain waves to the subtle energyfields of other people for reasons that range from emotionally supportive andhealing prayer to informational connections, regardless of the distance betweenus and them.Perhaps not surprisingly, the results of the study parallel what used to happenbetween my mother and me during our Sunday afternoon phone calls. They also helpexplain how a mother who has a son or daughter serving in a military combat zonehalf a world away could be attuned to what’s happening in her child’s life, likeKaye Young was to events occurring in the life of her son, Ronald.REAL-WORLD INTUITIONIn 2003, Ronald Young, Jr., was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. Army servingwith the Fourth Brigade, First Cavalry Division, based out of Fort Hood, Texas.It was on a Sunday evening that his mother had a feeling—an intuitive sense—thather son was in trouble. At the time he was piloting an Apache helicopter on amilitary mission southwest of Baghdad in Iraq. In Kaye’s words: “I just had amother’s feeling—I felt like Ron was there with me. I felt like he put his armsaround me.”6 [endnotes.xhtml#fn124]Not long after Kaye’s private premonition, her fears were confirmed. Militaryofficials paid a visit to the family home and informed Kaye and other familymembers that Ron’s helicopter had gone down the previous evening in the city ofKarbala. Information was sparse, and Ron’s whereabouts were unknown. He waslisted by the Army as missing in action.When she heard the official confirmation that Ron was missing, Kaye recalls thatshe immediately screamed, “I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!” And she did knowit. While she may not have known the specifics of what happened, sheknew—because her intuition had already informed her—that her son was in trouble.It was only through a television report shown in the United Arab Emiratescapital of Abu Dhabi that the family learned of Ron’s fate. He and another pilotwere shown alive and in captivity. In the film they were talking with someonewho could not be seen on the camera. And although they were prisoners of war,they appeared to be in reasonably good condition.7 [endnotes.xhtml#fn125]Fortunately, there’s a happy ending to this story. Ronald Young was freed fromcaptivity in a daring rescue performed by U.S. Marines in April 2003. Rescuedalong with Young was the other pilot of his helicopter, David S. Williams, andfive other POWs from the 507th Maintenance Company.8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn126] Theintuitive connection that Kaye Young had with her son gave her insight into herson’s experience before anything was known officially. It’s a powerful exampleof how important information about our loved ones can appear spontaneously inour everyday lives.Key 27: The emotional bond that exists between a mother and her children is nowscientifically documented through studies that offer insights into the intuitiveconnection that we all can develop in our relationships.INTUITION ON DEMANDIn the previous examples, the intuitive connection between people occurredspontaneously. They did nothing special in their lives to consciously initiatethe experience. It just seemed to happen. It is common to experience this kindof intuition with people with whom we have strong emotional ties, because whathappens in their lives is significant to our lives, as well. The technical namefor this intuitive experience is psychophysical coherence, often shortenedsimply to coherence.Now, although it can be a beautiful experience to have a deep connection withanother person, when it’s a spontaneous experience, it is difficult to rely onit to guide us in the moments that we need it the most, because we never knowwhen or if the experience is going to happen again.If we’re just sitting somewhere waiting for the veils to drop and the universeto show us the right medical decision to make, the right job offer to accept,the best moment to end a relationship, or whether or not we should make a phonecall to a friend we’re concerned about, we may find ourselves waiting for areally long time. The reason is that spontaneous intuition is justthat—spontaneous! It happens when it wants to, not always when we need it.This is where intuition on demand comes in.Just as it’s possible to turn on our televisions and tune in to a box-office-hitmovie in our own homes on the day and the time that we choose, we also cancreate coherence between our brains and hearts and trigger the deepest possiblestates of intuition when we choose. It’s our ability to trigger our deepintuition consciously and intentionally that awakens the wisdom of the heartthat may have formerly seemed sporadic and elusive in the past. When we thinkabout the connection between Kaye and her son in Iraq, we begin to glimpse theuntapped potential of such ability in our lives.That potential is available for us in our everyday lives. And typically it’s inthe throes of what everyday life presents to us that we need our intuition themost. Deciding whether or not to go forward with leading a group into Egypt inthe late 1990s is a perfect example of the kind of question that has no clearanswer. It’s also a perfect example of a time when the intuitive guidance of theheart was clear, direct, and accurate.A LIFE-OR-DEATH DECISION MADE IN THE HEARTIn November 1997, I was scheduled to take a tour group into Egypt. This was partof an annually scheduled pilgrimage I had led since 1992. To say that travelingEgypt is an amazing journey would be an understatement—it’s beyond amazing! Toactually stand in front of the Sphinx, a mysterious figure that I had studied inpictures as a child, or at the base of the Great Pyramid, looking up at over 400feet of stones once covered in veneer, now naked and visible, was an experienceof a lifetime. And I was under contract to lead a multinational group into theEgyptian desert to have precisely these sorts of experiences.Then the national media began carrying horrific images of the events occurringon November 17 during the evening news. Though the details were still emerging,the gist of the story was clear. Armed terrorists had killed 58 foreign touristsand 4 Egyptians in a particularly savage attack at the temple of QueenHatshepsut, a popular archaeological site near the city of Luxor.9[endnotes.xhtml#fn127] My group was scheduled to leave for our tour, whichincluded a stop at the place of these killings, the following week.What has now become known as the Luxor Massacre was devastating for the countryof Egypt on a number of levels. The tourism industry was crushed. Hundreds oftour companies immediately canceled their tours and pulled out of the country.Airlines stopped flying into Cairo. Hotels were empty. And the pride of theEgyptian people was suffering a deep hurt. “This is not us,” my Egyptian friendstold me on the telephone, pleading, “Please don’t think of us in this way.”Immediately I began receiving phone calls regarding the planned tour. The peoplewho were signed up for the trip begged me not to cancel. The Egyptianauthorities were concerned about the possibility of another attack. And the tourcompany was waiting for me to make a decision and to do so quickly. Family andfriends urged me not to go. The choices were clear: I could postpone the tripuntil another time, cancel it altogether, or go forward with the trip asplanned. I felt pulled from all sides. Everyone I spoke with had an opinion, andtheir opinions all made perfect sense. And just when I thought I had made mychoice, someone would call me and supply a good reason to make another choice.Clearly, this was one of those times when the decision was not black and white.There was no right or wrong in the situation and no way of knowing what wouldhappen over the course of the following days and weeks. There was only me, myinstincts, my intuition, and my promise to honor my group and myself with thebest choice possible.THE LANGUAGE OF THE HEARTOverwhelmed with the chaos of information and opinions, I turned off thetelephone to shut out the input from other people. From my home in the highdesert of northern New Mexico, I went for a long walk down a dirt road that Ihad walked many times in the past when I’d needed to make a tough decision. AndI applied in my life precisely the technique that I will share later in thischapter to create coherence between my head and my heart, to get in touch withmy deepest intuition regarding the tour. I stopped walking long enough to closemy eyes, turn my attention inward, and focus on my heart.Following the guidance of Tibetan monks and nuns and yogis I’ve met, and certainof my indigenous friends, I knew that it would help to touch the area of myheart with my fingertips during this process to draw my awareness to the placeof the touch. And as I began to slow my breathing, I felt a familiar sense ofcalm wash over my body. I felt like myself, and the more I did, the more thehorrible events of the day began to take on a new meaning. As I felt thefeelings of gratitude, in this instance, for the calm in my body and for theopportunity to make a powerful choice, I asked the question that no one elsecould answer. From a place of heart intelligence, without using my thinkingmind, I silently asked, Is this a good time for my group to experience themysteries of Egypt?Through the years of using heart-based intelligence, I’ve learned that the heartworks best when it’s given brief phrases to respond to rather than multiplesentences. The heart doesn’t need an introduction to the question that we’reasking or an explanation of the history of the decision that’s at hand. Ourheart already knows all these things.For some people, the wisdom of the heart comes as a feeling. For others, it canbe a sense of knowing without question, while for still others, the answeremerges as a familiar voice that they’ve known throughout their lifetime. Forme, it’s generally a combination of all these. I often hear a subtle voicefirst, reinforced by a solid feeling of reassurance, safety, and certainty,which is followed by a sense of resolution and completeness. And that’sprecisely what happened on that day in the high desert.Before I even finished asking the question, the answer was there for me,complete, direct, and clear. Immediately I felt—I knew—that our journey would beokay. It would be profound, deep, and healing. Most of all, I knew that byallowing our intuition to guide us through each step of our journey, we would besafe. I knew in that moment that I would soon be with my group in Egypt.I want to be absolutely clear here about what I’m saying. My decision to goforward with the trip was based upon the sensory impressions that I received asthe result of a methodical and science-based process. It was not made from asense of hope that everything would go according to plan or by simply trustingthat all would be well. While this kind of trust is perfect for some situations,when it comes to the lives and safety of a tour group the decision needs to bebased on something more. For me, that something was the wisdom of deepintuition.The steps that I applied to trigger my deep intuition also happen to parallel aprocess that other people sometimes use in a less structured way, but withsimilar results. The value of accessing heart intelligence is that it becomespossible to ask our questions with no attachment to the outcome, through chanteishta, the single eye of the heart.When I was clear with my decision, I personally called each person scheduled forthe tour to inform them. All of them, regardless of age or nationality, told methey trusted me to go forward with the trip, but only if I felt it was safe todo so—which I did.Key 28: Intentional heart focus empowers us to consistently experience deepstates of intuition when we choose, on demand.THE REWARD FOR TRUSTING MY INTUITIONI left for Egypt on schedule the next week with 40 amazing people to begin aheartfelt adventure that would be full of surprises. We arrived in a countrythat was mourning the loss of many lives and reeling from the impact of theattack. The president of Egypt at the time, Hosni Mubarak, was a friend of ourguide and extremely grateful that we came to his country during such a difficulttime. We received an official letter from Mubarak giving the Department ofAntiquities permission to open rare archaeological sites to us throughout ourtour. Some of the sites, we later discovered, had not been opened to the publicsince they were first excavated in the late 1800s, and they have not been openedagain since our tour! Needless to say, the journey was awe-inspiring, and thebonds between members of our group and the Egyptian people with whom they forgedfriendships have lasted to this very day.The beauty of heart-based wisdom and choices made from that wisdom is that we’rerelieved of the burden of second-guessing our decisions. Based upon what I knewto be true at the time, I felt that my decision to lead the tour was a good one.I also believe that if I’d canceled the trip based upon what I knew that day,that also would have been a good decision. In having made the choice to goforward with the trip based upon the wisdom of my heart, however, I feel that Ihonored the people who trusted me to lead them, as well as myself, by making thebest choice possible.This story is only one example of how the tool of deep intuition has served meagain and again in the real world. And while this example is about a bigdecision involving 40 people and a trip that took us halfway around the world, Iuse precisely the same technique, sometimes on a daily basis, to help me plan myschedule, temper relationships, and honor the principles that are important tome when I’m tested in life.What I know with certainty is that we can never go wrong when we honor ourhearts. I also know that if heart intelligence works for me, it will work foryou.YOUR HEART’S WISDOM IS TRUE ONLY FOR YOUYour heart’s intelligence is with you always. It’s constant. You can trust it.It’s important to acknowledge this because it means that the wisdom of yourheart—the answers to the deepest and most mysterious questions of life that noone else can answer—already exist within you. Rather than being something thatneeds to be built or created before it can be used, the link between your heartand the place that holds your answers is already established. And while it’sbeen with you since the time you were born, it’s your choice as to when youaccess that link as a “hotline” to the deepest truths of your life.You may choose to tap your heart’s wisdom only in special circumstances, whenthere is nowhere to go and no one to turn to for guidance. Or you may choose todevelop a relationship with your heart that becomes your second-nature, go-tosource of guidance each and every day of your life. Regardless of the role youchoose for heart intelligence in your life, it’s up to you as to how you sharewhat you hear from your heart and how you manage the reality of your everydayworld. This is where discernment comes in.While the guidance of your heart is true for you, it may not be true for anotherperson. Our friends, children, siblings, life partners, and relatives all havetheir own heart wisdom to access. When we try to make a life-changing decisionfor other people in an isolated moment of time, we can’t possibly know withcertainty what’s true for them in that moment. We can’t possibly know, forexample, intimate details of their life history from the time of their birththat have brought them to the present moment and their current circumstances.And because we cannot know these things with certainty, we can’t anticipate howthe well-intentioned sharing of our wisdom will affect the experience of anotherperson.I’m mentioning this now just as a point of consideration.When you find yourself wondering if you should share what your heart hasrevealed to you, as a guideline I recommend asking the following threequestions. 1. What is my intention in sharing what I’ve discovered? 2. Who will benefit if I share this information? Or more specifically: How will _______ benefit if I share this information? (Fill in the blank with the name of the person with whom you’re considering sharing your revelation.) 3. Who may be hurt by my choice to share this information?The key to using these questions is to be absolutely clear with yourself aboutthe very first question. To be conscious of your intention is the foundation ofyour personal responsibility. With your intention firmly in place, it becomeseasy to evaluate your answers to the next two questions to see if they honoryour stated intention. Whether they do or don’t, through this simple process youwill find the answer to your question about the appropriateness of sharing yourdeep knowing.With these ideas in mind, let’s discuss how to apply the steps of coherence toaccess the intelligence and guidance of your heart.ASKING YOUR HEART A QUESTIONNow that I’ve described the role of the heart in accessing deep intuition, I’dlike to take this opportunity to share a proven technique that allows you toaccess its wisdom, as well. And I want this exercise to be personal, so I willoffer this section as if I’m speaking to you directly while you are sitting withme in my living room. This exercise is one of those places where science andspirituality overlap beautifully. While science can describe the closerelationship between the heart and the brain, the ancient spiritual practicesand self-mastery techniques that have helped people rely on this relationshipfor thousands of years do so without needing a scientific explanation.It’s probably no coincidence that the rigorous scientific techniques developedby the researchers at the Institute of HeartMath closely parallel some of thetechniques preserved in the monasteries of ancient traditions or by indigenousspiritual practitioners. We all learn in different ways, and my sense is thatwhen something is true, it appears in the world in different forms to reflectthe variations in our learning.With this idea in mind, I’ve chosen to share the following IHM technique, withpermission, because it’s safe, it’s based upon well-researched science thatvalidates the steps, and it has been simplified in a way that makes itaccessible and easy to use in our everyday lives.As with any technique that’s passed from teacher to student, however, the stepsfor creating heart-brain coherence are best experienced with a seasonedpractitioner to facilitate the process. So while I’ll describe these principlesfor creating heart-brain coherence in the following paragraphs, I also encourageyou to experience them for yourself using the no-cost online instructions foundon the Institute of HeartMath website (see the Resources section).The technique to create heart-brain coherence is appropriately called the QuickCoherence® Technique and has been refined by the Institute of HeartMath into thefirst three simple steps described below. Independently, each step sends asignal to the body that a specific shift has been put into motion. Combined, thesteps create an experience that takes us back to a natural harmony that existedin our bodies earlier in life, before we began to disconnect our heart-brainnetwork through our conditioning. Steps 4 and 5, where we access our heart’swisdom, build upon the coherence created in Steps 1 through 3.Five Steps to Ask Your Heart a QuestionThe steps to create quick coherence for accessing your heart’s intelligence areas follows. * Step 1: Create Heart Focus * Action: Allow your awareness to move from your mind to the area of your heart. * Result: This sends a signal to your heart that a shift has taken place: You are no longer engaged in the world around you and are now becoming aware of the world within you. * Step 2: Slow Your Breathing * Action: Begin to breathe a little more slowly than usual. Take approximately five to six seconds to inhale, and use the same pace as you exhale. * Result: This simple step sends a second signal to your body that you are safe and in a place that supports your process. Deep, slow breathing has long been known to stimulate the relaxation response of the nervous system (aka the parasympathetic response). * Step 3: Feel a Rejuvenating Feeling * Action: To the best of your ability, feel a genuine sense of care, appreciation, gratitude, or compassion for anything or anyone. The key to success here is that your feeling be as sincere and heartfelt as possible. * Result: The quality of this feeling fine-tunes and optimizes the coherence between your heart and your brain. While everyone is capable of evoking a feeling for this step, it’s one of those processes that you may need to experiment with to find what works best for you.With the successful completion of Step 3, the connection linking the heart andbrain—and resulting in heart-brain coherence—has been established. At thispoint, the heart and brain are in communication through the neural network thatconnects them. While this is technically the completion of the Quick Coherence®Technique itself, it’s also a beginning step in other processes. We may use thecoherence we’ve created to access deeper states of awareness, including the deepintuition described in this chapter. It’s from a state of heart-brain coherencethat we may access our deep intuition and receive the guidance of our heart’sintelligence. Steps 4 and 5 below detail a procedure to do just that. * Step 4: Ask Your Heart a Question * Action: The previous three steps create the harmony between your brain and your heart that enables you to tap into your heart’s intelligence. As you continue to breathe and hold the focus in your heart, it is time to ask your question. Heart intelligence generally works best when the questions are brief and to the point. Remember, your heart doesn’t need a preface or the history of a situation before the question. Ask your question silently, as a single concise sentence, and then allow your heart to respond in a way that works for you. * Result: Your intuition opens up and you begin a dialogue.I’m often asked to interpret the symbols that show up in people’s dreams or themeaning of an experience that they’ve had in their lives. While it’s possiblefor me to offer an opinion, it’s just that. It’s my sense of what the image orexperience may mean in their life. The truth is that I can’t possibly know whatanother person’s dream or experience means for them. It’s also true that theycan!The key to being successful at dialoguing with your heart is this: If you areempowered enough to have the experience, then you are empowered to know foryourself what your experience means.While I don’t want to influence your questioning process, an example issometimes helpful. A mysterious dream is the perfect opportunity to apply heartwisdom to a real-world situation. From the heart-brain coherence established inthe previous three steps, simply ask the following kind of questions, filling inthe blank with the names of the people, symbols, or identities of what you’reasking about. These are example formats only. You can choose one that fits foryou or create your own using one of the following as a template. * * “From the place of my heart’s deepest knowing, I ask to be shown the significance of in my dream.” * “From the single eye of my heart that knows only my truth, I ask for the meaning of the that I saw in my dream.” * “Please help me to understand the significance of in my life.” * Step 5: Listen for an Answer * Action: Become aware of how your body feels immediately as you are asking your question in Step 4. Make a note of any sensations—such as warmth, tingling, or ringing of the ears—and emotions that may arise. For people who are already attuned to their bodies and their hearts’ intelligence, this step is the easiest part of the process. For those who may have had less experience in listening to their bodies, this is an exercise in awareness. * Result: Everyone learns and experiences uniquely. There is no correct or incorrect way of receiving your heart’s wisdom. The key here is to know what works best for you.As I mentioned before, I tend to receive my heart’s wisdom as words, while atthe same time feeling sensations of warmth in my body. Other people never hearwords but experience nonverbal forms of communication only, such as warmthradiating from their hearts or in their guts. Sometimes people feel a wave ofpeace wash over them as they receive the answer to their question. Remember, youand your body are unique partners in the world. What’s important here is tolisten to your own body to learn how it communicates with you and give it theopportunity to be heard.Now you have a step-by-step technique to help you feel empowered in the face oflife’s greatest challenges. While you probably can’t change the situations thatarrive at your doorstep, you can definitely change the way you feel in andrespond to those situations. If you’ve not already done so, you may discoverthat the wisdom of your heart becomes a great friend to you, one of the greatestsources of strength in your life. The consistency and accuracy of heart-basedsolutions empowers you to face any situation with any person or force with aconfidence that’s hard to find if you feel helpless, overwhelmed, powerless, andlost.I can honestly say that my heart’s wisdom has never led me to make a bad choice.And while I haven’t used this technique for every big decision I’ve made in mylife, I can also say with honesty that the only choices I’ve regretted are theones I made when I did not honor my heart’s wisdom.As you complete this exercise, I invite you to bear an important point in mind:There is no correct or incorrect way of receiving your heart’s wisdom. Each ofus is born with our own unique code that allows us to access our heart’s wisdomand apply it in our lives. The secret to the code is to know what works best foryou.Key 29: We can access our heart’s wisdom through a process that can besummarized in five simple steps: focus, breathe, feel, ask, and listen.IT’S SECOND NATURE TO ASK YOUR HEARTYour intuition can help you feel more empowered in the face of life’s greatestchallenges. Each time you access your heart’s wisdom, you are actuallyreinforcing and strengthening the neural connections that make our heart-brainconnection possible. I commonly hear from people who incorporate heartintelligence into their daily lives that the Quick Coherence® Technique becomeseasier to do over time.In fact, for some people, the experience becomes second nature, so that for themit is an automatic response rather than a structured technique. They findthemselves instinctively shifting their awareness to their hearts multiple timesthroughout the day to gain perspective on life’s challenges and to balancelife’s demands. They also discover that once they are in the heart, the abilityto embrace life issues in a compassionate way becomes second nature as well.When people share their stories of such experiences, although I’m always in aweof the process, I’m not surprised by what I hear, because the intuition thatnaturally flows from our hearts provides us with a stepping-stone to experiencethe deepest levels of sympathy, empathy, and ultimately compassion in our lives.When we think about it, this flow of experience makes perfect sense. After all,how can we relate to someone in a compassionate way if we cannot first identifywith the suffering they experience—and do so in a healthy way? The ability toidentify with another person’s experience of hurt, distress, or trauma withouttaking on their suffering as our own—an experience that is sometimes calledovercare—is the key to effectively supporting someone in their pain, distress,and trauma. This is where empathy comes in.The ability to relate to another person—or any form of life, for that matter—onan intimate level is known as empathy. Our capacity for empathy is the key toour capacity for compassion.EMPATHY: A STEPPING-STONE TO COMPASSIONIn the popular TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987–1994), one of thecore characters is counselor Deanna Troi (played by Marina Sirtis), an empath—aperson with the ability to sense the feelings and emotions of another beingwhile experiencing them on a personal level. Knowing that the stated mission oftheir futuristic journey through the universe is “to explore strange new worlds,to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one hasgone before,” it makes perfect sense to have a skilled empath as an integralpart of the ship’s crew. The multiyear duration of the Enterprise’s missionmakes it likely that the crew will encounter forms of life that do notcommunicate using words as we humans do. And throughout the series, that’sprecisely what happens. Thanks to the empathic skills of counselor Troi,however, those nonverbal exchanges are not a problem. Although each encounterwith an alien species is unique, such encounters tend to follow a common themethat goes something like the following plotline.The captain of the Enterprise is communicating with the leader of an alien craftthat has suddenly appeared with unknown intentions. While the leader of the darkship says to the captain, “We come in peace,” with his words, counselor Troi issensing another intention nonverbally. As an empath, she feels that somethingdangerous lies beneath the exchange between the two leaders. So while theEnterprise’s captain is listening to the alien, counselor Troi is whisperingwhat she senses into the captain’s ear, such as: “They want to destroy us.” Inthis instance, it’s easy to see why the counselor role is so valuable for themission of the Enterprise.Although the TV series is science fiction, the empathic abilities of counselorTroi are not. They’re real, and we each experience them to a greater or lesserdegree in our daily lives, often without even realizing what we’re experiencing.So what is empathy? How is it related to sympathy? And how may we experienceboth in a healthy way?image [images/img-164-1.png]Both empathy and sympathy are forms of intuition, and the words that describethese states share a common origin in the Greek language. They come from theroot word pathos, which means “feeling.” This is where knowing a little Greekoffers us a clear distinction between their meanings. The Greek prefix sym- insympathy means “with.” The prefix em- in empathy means “within.” Fromtranslating these simple prefixes, the difference becomes clear.To have sympathy means to identify with others in their hurt or suffering. Whenwe’re sympathetic, we say that we feel for the plight or the loss of anotherperson. When friends or family members experience the death of a loved one, forexample, we send sympathy cards to let them know that we are acknowledging theirloss and sense what it must mean to them.When we’re sympathetic toward other beings, we’re observers, longing to standwith them and support them in their experience. We sometimes say that we can“only imagine” what such a loss may feel like. And when we say this, ourstatement is completely accurate. Because the loss we’re sympathizing with isnot ours directly, we are left to identify with our loved ones’ hurt by drawingupon memories of our own experiences to approximate what they must be feeling.Sympathy is the first step to achieving empathy.When we experience empathy for others, we go beyond sympathy. We begin to closethe gap between acknowledging someone else’s suffering from a distance andfeeling their suffering ourselves. We place ourselves perceptually andemotionally in their situation to experience what they are experiencing. Indoing so we identify more closely, in an even more profound way, with thesuffering of others.Both sympathy and empathy are precursors of compassion. We must first experienceempathy for another person’s suffering before we can become compassionate in theway we respond to them. Just to be clear, however, having empathy in a situationdoesn’t necessarily mean that we will become compassionate. It’s possible tohave empathy for another person’s experience without that empathy leading tocompassion.To be a compassionate person is a choice. And when we make such a choice, ourexperience carries us to a deeper level of experience.Key 30: Intuition, sympathy, and empathy are the steppingstones to compassion.In compassion, we become involved. We actually do something in an attempt toalleviate the suffering of one or more others. And while we hope our actionswill ultimately contribute in some way to alleviating the suffering of others,the goal of compassion is less about the outcome itself and more about us andhow we are changed in the presence of a compassionate choice. Once our livesreflect the compassion that we choose, it’s then that the compassion we’vebecome can be reflected in everything we do.For centuries, the great spiritual masters have reminded us that a compassionateresponse to our world begins with us and lives in the way we relate to theworld. From this perspective we can say that compassion is a powerful innertechnology, an advanced form of intuition that gives us the power to createsustainable solutions from a very personal level.Any doubt I originally had regarding the power of compassion in our livesdisappeared after I had the opportunity to spend time with Tibetans who had beensteeped in the traditions of compassion from an early age.MEETING WITH THE ABBOTOn an icy high-altitude morning in the spring of 1998, I found myself living areality that I’d dreamed about for as long as I could remember. I was leading acombined research trip and pilgrimage into one of the most magnificent,pristine, remote, and absolutely beautiful places remaining on earth, the ruggedTibetan Plateau, a place where Buddhist monasteries have survived the harshelements of time for over 1,500 years.On the 16th day of the trip, I found myself seated along with a few members ofmy group in the cramped quarters of a tiny chapel hidden deep within the massivewalls of the ancient monastery we were visiting that day. Surrounded by Buddhistaltars and faded thangkas (intricately brocaded tapestries that preserve thegreat teachings of the past), which were barely visible in the dim light, we satface-to-face with the highest-ranking religious leader of the monastery, theelder abbot. Through the skills of our translator we were given a privateaudience with this lifelong student of meditation and compassion.During the hour or so of this intimate encounter, I had the opportunity to askquestions about Tibetan traditions, beliefs, and the deepest mysteries of life.My questions were direct and to the point, and the abbot clearly enjoyed theopportunity to vary his daily routine with our meeting. So much so, in fact,that he even resisted the urging from his assistants who were trying to help himleave us to go to another appointment.I’m sharing this story because it was the trust and friendship from this initialmeeting that paved the way for a second meeting in a different chapel of thesame monastery seven years later.In 2005, I had the opportunity to revisit the monasteries of the TibetanPlateau. This time I was with another group of researchers and pilgrims, and ourtrip lasted a total of 18 days. When we returned to the monastery that I’dvisited previously, we learned that the elder abbot who had been so generouswith his time in 1998 was no longer there—he had died. Although we never learnedthe details of when or how he’d passed, the monks left no doubt in our mindsthat he was no longer in this world. Clearly, however, the friendships that we’destablished seven years earlier had left a mark of goodwill among those who hadbeen assistants to the elder abbot and among other monks still living in themonastery. So even though we’d never met the new, younger leader—only in hislate 80s—who had replaced the elder, our goodwill and strong relationshipspreceded us. When the new abbot heard that our group had returned, we werewelcomed warmly and allowed another opportunity to continue the deepconversation that began seven years before.THE FORCE THAT CONNECTS ALL THINGSOn another frosty Tibetan morning, this time in a different chapel of the samemonastery, we found ourselves seated with the new abbot. Only minutes before,we’d been led through a meandering, stone-lined passageway that led to thistiny, cold, and dimly lit room. As we waited for the abbot to meet us, Iremember thinking to myself that we could only imagine the conversations,teachings, and initiation processes that had occurred in the very place we foundourselves that morning. In the distance, I heard the faint sound of leathersandals slapping against the cold stone floors. I knew that it was the abbotcoming for our meeting. As the sound grew louder, I could feel the growinganticipation in the room with the realization that our meeting, though delayed,was really going to happen.The abbot pushed aside the heavy tapestry that hung in the doorway to keep thecold air out (or to keep the warmer air in the room). With a huge grin, hetouched the thumb of his right hand to his heart, fingers together and pointingtoward the sky, in a half prayer mudra, while the other hand held on to hisrobes as he glided across the room. Following the formalities of introductionsand the blessing of the khatas—ceremonial white silk scarves that each personwho meets him traditionally offers him for blessing—the abbot signaled that hewas available for questions. It was here, nestled in the silence of the ancientmonastery, that I asked a question regarding the topic of the book I was writingat the time, The Divine Matrix.“In your tradition,” I began, “what is the force that connects us with otherpeople, our world, and all things? What is the conduit that carries our prayersbeyond our bodies and the stuff that holds the universe together?”With the smile that never left his face, the abbot held eye contact with me asour translator repeated my question in Tibetan. What happened next came as asurprise to me and the others in the room.Immediately the two men—the abbot and his translator—began a loud and livelyexchange with animated gestures and enthusiastic emphasis that began to soundlike a Tibetan shouting match! While my Tibetan is terrible and I couldn’tunderstand a single word that either man was saying, the nature of theconversation seemed obvious. They were struggling with the meaning of myquestion and where it fit into the abbot’s teachings. He was accustomed toanswering such questions from familiar students who had already studied with himand had years of training that would prepare them for such a conversation. Butthe abbot didn’t know me. He had no idea of my background, my traditions, or myspiritual experience, and he simply didn’t know where and how to begin hisanswer.Answering me as he might answer a lifelong monk would be like parents telling ayoung child where babies come from without the child first having the benefit ofknowing about the biology of intimate human relations. While such a questioncould be answered, for the child the answer wouldn’t make sense without theprior knowledge. In a similar way, the abbot knew he could answer my questionregarding the force that connects all things. What he didn’t know is if I wouldunderstand his answer.A FORCE OF NATURE, A HUMAN EXPERIENCE, OR BOTH?Suddenly the room became quiet. Everyone stopped talking and the abbot liftedhis gaze upward to the thangkas that covered the chapel walls. After inhalingdeeply the cool, thin air, he answered my question in a way that was bothsurprising and unexpected. He looked at me and simply spoke one Tibetan word.Instinctively I glanced to the translator. “What did he just say?” I asked. “Itwas only one word!”I wasn’t prepared for what I heard next from my translator. “Compassion,” hesaid. “The geshe says that ‘compassion’ is the answer to your question.Compassion is what connects us to every creature and to all things.”The reason I was surprised by the answer is because in my experience, compassionhad been taught as an experience and a practice. We feel compassion forourselves and for others who are facing difficult life circumstances. We alsoexperience compassion as a practice in our daily lives. If I understood theabbot’s answer correctly, he was now telling us that compassion is more than afeeling—it’s a force of nature.I had never heard compassion referred to as a physical force. Yet this singleword was his answer to my question: “What connects us with our world?” And thisapparent contradiction was the source of my next question. “How can that be?” Iasked the translator, looking for clarity in what I was hearing. “Is he tellingus that compassion is a force of nature that connects all things, or is hetelling us that it’s a human emotion that we experience?”Once again an animated dialogue broke out as the translator conveyed my questionto the abbot. Once again, the abbot broke his connection with my eyes, took adeep breath, looked toward the translator, and answered my question with asingle word. “Yes!” he said in Tibetan. That was his answer. It was also the endof our exchange.Following nearly 10 minutes of a bantering dialogue involving the deepestelements of Tibetan Buddhism, all that I got to take away with me was theTibetan word for compassion. I remember leaving the monastery that day feelingincomplete, like there was something that had been literally lost intranslation. The answer from the abbot was a bit mysterious and didn’t seem tomake sense. Something just didn’t fit.A few days later I discovered the reason why.At yet another monastery, this time with a scholarly monk rather than ahigh-ranking abbot, I found myself engaged in the same conversation once again.This time, however, we were in the casual environment of the monk’s cell. It wasthe tiny, unadorned room where he ate, slept, prayed, and studied when he wasnot in the monastery’s great chanting hall.By now, our translator was becoming familiar with the form of my questions andwhat I was trying to understand. As we huddled around the heat of the yak-butterlamps burning in the smoke-filled room, I looked up at the low ceiling. It wascovered with black soot from countless years of similar lamps burning for heatand light, just the way they were on that cold afternoon.Once again, through the translator, I posed the same question to the monk: “Iscompassion a force of creation or is it an experience in the body?” He rolledhis eyes to the soot on the ceiling where I had been looking only secondsbefore. With a deep sigh, he thought for a moment, drawing from what he hadlearned in the monastery since he entered at the age of eight. He now appearedto be in his mid-20s. Slowly he lowered his eyes and looked at me as heresponded.The answer was short. It was powerful. And it made tremendous sense. “It isboth!” were the words that came back to me from the monk. “Compassion is both aforce of nature and a human experience.”In that moment the earlier encounter with the abbot suddenly made sense, and Iunderstood the deep teaching that he had shared with me and the members of mytour group.Key 31: Compassion is both a force of nature and an emotional experience thatconnects us with nature and all life.Einstein’s CompassionOn that day in a monk’s room halfway around the world, hours from the nearesttown, at nearly 15,000 feet above sea level, I heard the words of a simple, yetpowerful, wisdom that many Western traditions, including science, haveoverlooked to this day. The monk had just reminded us that a single humanexperience that sets us apart from all other forms of life—compassion—is thesame force of nature that intimately connects us with all things. When weexperience true compassion in our lives, our sense of separation betweenourselves and others, all life, and the world, as well as within ourselves,disappears.Albert Einstein recognized the power of compassion in our lives, as well as thepotential it holds to alleviate suffering. In his words, “Our task must be tofree ourselves . . . by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all livingcreatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”10 [endnotes.xhtml#fn128] Thefourteenth Dalai Lama carried this understanding from personal healing to globalsurvival, stating, “I truly believe that compassion provides the basis of humansurvival.”11 [endnotes.xhtml#fn129] The recognition of compassion’s role in ourlives opens the door to the depths of our greatest self-mastery and theextraordinary experiences that make us human.As a masterful teacher, the abbot felt a responsibility to answer the questionsfrom his students in a way that is both honoring and meaningful. Without knowinganything about me, my background, or my history and beliefs, the abbot had noway of knowing if his wisdom would be either honoring or meaningful for me. Hesimply didn’t know how his words would land in my life experience. That was theroot of the struggle that I witnessed between him and the translator before hespoke the word compassion.Fortunately for me, my translator was also a good friend. He knew me. He knewabout my family, my life, my corporate and academic background, my education,and my spiritual journey. Armed with that knowledge, he was able to reassure theabbot that whatever wisdom he chose to share would find its way to my mind andto my heart in a respectful and healthy way. That was everything the abbotneeded to hear to reassure him that he was honoring his sense of responsibility.In doing so he had expanded the way I’d been taught to think about compassionand the role it plays in our lives.COMPASSION, WISDOM, AND BALANCEThe teachings of our Tibetan abbot specifically, and of Tibetan Buddhism ingeneral, are based in the Mahayana Buddhist traditions, one of the two (or insome classifications, three) major branches of Buddhism. According to itsteachings, Mahayana is the path that quickly leads an individual to completeenlightenment for a single purpose: so that they may use their enlightenment toalleviate the suffering of others. Someone who follows such a path is known as abodhisattva. I’m sharing this background here because of the context it offersfor understanding compassion.The sensual nature and poetic language of the Mahayana teachings (known assutras) have always touched me with their beauty. They have also been a refugeand a source of comfort in some of the most difficult times of my life. When itcomes to the sutras’ description of compassion, for example, they portraybodhisattvas as having two wings that carry them toward the goal ofenlightenment. One wing is the wing of wisdom. The other wing is the wing ofcompassion. The sutras describe these two qualities as equals in a partnershipthat is necessary for each of us if we choose a journey to enlightenment.In an especially powerful way, the sutras describe how the bodhisattvas have noplace to stand in the world. The reason is that there is nothing thatbodhisattvas can call their own. They have no land, no possessions, and noattachments in the world. But this idea goes even deeper, penetrating theessence of the way we think of ourselves in the world. This deeper layer of thebodhisattva is best described in the words of Buddhist scholar Joanna Macy,Ph.D. “Nor is there a solid self, or an unchanging identity, or any security, aswe understand security,” she says.12 [endnotes.xhtml#fn130] Instead,bodhisattvas move confidently through the world, trusting in the wisdom andcompassion they have attained to navigate any situation that life may put attheir feet.The key insight here is that compassion must be balanced with wisdom to serve usin a healthy way. Compassion and wisdom must become our allies if we are toexpress the deepest truths of our humanness.My journey to unlock the mystery of intuition and compassion in my own life hasled me to some of the most secluded and mysterious places remaining on earth.It’s in the ancient monasteries and nunneries, within the brittle pages oftimeworn manuscripts, and among the indigenous people themselves that theirwisdom has been preserved for us today. Rather than discovering cut-and-driedanswers in these places, what I’ve found are the keys to a way of thinking thatmakes new answers and new ways of thinking possible. Maybe it should come as nosurprise that the clues to our bodies’ deepest mysteries and to our greatestpowers are hidden in the plain sight of our everyday experiences. And themystery doesn’t end when we learn the language of the heart.Just like the introduction of a book is the guide that prepares us for thechapters that follow, our sense of intuition and compassion guide us through thenuances of life and give us a means to answer the questions that show up ineveryday living."},{"pageContent":"chapter six [contents.xhtml#toc10]image [images/img-175-1.png]WE’RE “WIRED” FOR LONG LIFE [contents.xhtml#toc10]Awakening the Power of Our Immortal Cells [contents.xhtml#toc10]“Many things can prolong your life, but only wisdom can save it.”— NEEL BURTON (1978–), BRITISH PSYCHIATRIST AND PHILOSOPHER“From the moment we’re born, we begin to die.”I was hearing these words from a dear friend whom I’d known in northern Missouriduring my teen years. (I’ll call him Michael to honor his privacy.) We eachshared histories so similar, it sounded like we could be brothers. Both of ourfathers had left our families when we were 10 years old. We both had a youngersibling. We both found ourselves living in the same low-incomegovernment-subsidized housing and walking to the same school and the sameclasses each morning. And we’d both turned to music to help us cope with theturbulent world of broken homes that we found ourselves in, with me as aguitarist and Michael as a drummer. The year was 1968 and together we’dwitnessed on live television the aftermath of the assassinations of MartinLuther King, Jr., and then Robert Kennedy barely two months later, along withthe horrors of the killing of protestors at the South Carolina State Universitycampus and police brutality during anti-Vietnam riots during the DemocraticNational Convention in Chicago. We played together in the same rock group, andafter our already late-night band practices, we’d stay awake until the wee hoursof the next morning talking about America, American politics, and the future ofthe world.It was against the backdrop of this friendship that Michael shared his lifephilosophy that we begin to die the moment we’re born. While I was certainlyfamiliar with the saying, when I’d heard it in the past I’d typically written itoff as a fringe idea—one that I didn’t necessarily agree with—but accepted asone of the many new viewpoints that were emerging at the time. When I heard itfrom my friend, however, something felt different. This time the words werecoming from someone I cared about, and they were being used to justify a way ofthinking and living that paved the way to a life of excess, overindulgence, andultimately, bad endings.Michael and I were deeply engaged in a conversation about life and how to liveit to the fullest. It was a conversation that couldn’t have come from moredifferent perspectives. Michael believed what he’d heard about us dying from theminute we’re born, and he had taken this to heart as his primary lifephilosophy. He literally believed that our lives are like a sealed jar ofpotential. When we’re born, we open the jar and begin to use up our potentialfrom the instant of our first breath.“We have what we have, and when it’s over it’s over,” he said. “When it’s gone,it’s gone.”ARE WE LIVING IN THE MOMENT OR ARE WE LIVING FOR THE MOMENT?In Michael’s way of thinking, there are two mysterious unknowns that are with uswhen we begin our lives. The first is that we simply don’t know how full our“jar of life” is when we arrive in this world. The second is that we don’t knowhow fast we’ll use whatever life we’re given. We could be blessed with a jarthat’s overflowing with vibrant health. If so, we could be in this world for 100years or more. Or we might begin our lives with our jar only half full—somethingthat Michael called “beginning with half a tank.” His thinking was that if westarted with less, we’d use what we had faster, life would be short, and we’ddie young. Michael’s belief was that it’s precisely because we don’t know howfull or empty our own life vessel is that it makes sense to live life full-on,for the only moment that is certain: the moment of now.While I got his meaning and understood the underlying philosophy of what myfriend was saying, I also know that this kind of thinking means different thingsto different people. For Michael, the idea of living for the moment meantspeaking whatever words came to mind and acting in whatever way moved him in anygiven moment. (This is very different from living in the moment, where we fullyembrace our senses, we become aware of our surroundings, and we live, act, andspeak consciously and responsibly from our enhanced awareness.) From Michael’spoint of view, he felt that in order to honestly live a spontaneous life, therecould be no filters on what he said or what he did. Each moment simply was whatit was. And it was precisely this thinking that had prompted our conversation.Not surprisingly, Michael was in full-blown life-crisis mode when we met thatday. His interpretation of living for the moment had led him to avoid allcommitments at all costs: commitment to himself, to his family, to his body andhis health, to other people, to friendships, and to intimacy. The consequencesof his approach to life had caught up with him and brought him disappointment,unfulfilled dreams, and the sense that, while a successful, healthy, and lovinglifetime was certainly possible for some people, that possibility was foreveryone except him.In the moment of our conversation, Michael found himself experiencing a healthcrisis. He was only in his twenties, yet the intensity of his drug and alcoholuse had culminated in a liver condition that needed immediate medical attention.He was also alone in his life. He had no money, nowhere to live, and no one toturn to. As far as I knew, I was his one remaining friend. And while I’velearned to hold off when it comes to offering personal advice to friends (unlessI’m asked to share), my friend seem to be mired so deeply in his pain that itnever occurred to him that there could be another way of thinking about his lifephilosophy, and it didn’t occur to me to withhold. I took a chance and offeredsome counsel. “What if the life philosophy you heard of, about dying from themoment we’re born, is a bit off?” I asked.The look on Michael’s face when he heard my question told me I had hisattention. “What do you mean when you say ‘a bit off’?” he said.“I was being kind,” I replied with a smile. “I didn’t want to shoot down yourentire worldview in a single sentence.”“Okay, I got it!” he said. “What are you telling me? Just say the words.”Hearing my friend ask me for clarity was just what I’d been hoping for. It wasthe way in, my opportunity to offer another point of view, and I grabbed thatopportunity immediately. “What if life works in a way that is just the oppositeof what you’ve been led to believe?” I asked. “What would it mean if youdiscovered that from the moment we’re born we begin to heal?”Michael looked stunned. This simple shift of thinking had never occurred to him.Just hearing the words opened the door to a possibility that he’d never evenconsidered. “Wow! If that were true,” he said, “it would change everything. Itwould mean that we can keep filling our tank of life forever—or at least for along time.”“I know,” I said. “That’s the whole point. And we don’t need to ask what itwould mean if we discovered this possibility, because we already have. Ancienttraditions, such as yoga, qigong, and Ayurvedic medicine, have alreadydiscovered that our bodies are literally wired to heal from the instant we’reborn. They’ve also discovered that we’re the ones that start and stop theprocess. The key is to create the conditions that make the healing possible.There are many ways to do so, and this is why we can think of life in terms of atank that we keep filling, rather than one that becomes emptier with eachpassing day.”Shortly after our conversation, Michael moved to another city. His estrangedfather heard about what was happening, contacted Michael, and offered him a homewhile he was working out his health issues. Over the years I lost track of myfriend. I never saw him again. But when I think back to those years in northernMissouri, I’m always grateful for the deep conversations that gave us both newways to see the world, and to think about our lives.The more I’ve learned about the wisdom of the human body, and the more time I’vespent with indigenous people that embrace that wisdom, the more I’ve come tounderstand about the potential that I shared with Michael. The capacity to healis something that we already have and that already lives within each of us. Fromyogis, monks, and nuns to shamans, mystics, and curanderos, people whoserespective traditions are very different from one another, there’s a fundamentaltheme that weaves the threads of each tradition into a single, powerfultapestry. These ancient and indigenous traditions teach that the quality of ourlives, and how long we live, at root comes down to the way we think of ourselvesin the world.To replace the limiting beliefs that we’ve learned from our families, friends,and social institutions with new, self-empowering perspectives truly does, inMichael’s words, “change everything.” I discovered this for myself in the mostdirect way possible when I met a Tibetan nun who defied the conventional wisdomI had learned as to what age means and the role of longevity in our lives.THE NUN’S SECRETAfter nearly two weeks of acclimating to elevations as high as 16,000 feet abovesea level and having our bodies bounced on the stiff spring seats of an ancientChinese school bus along roads that were little more than washed-out trails, wearrived at the remote monastery. It was hours away from the nearest village andoccupied only by a group of about 100 Tibetan nuns who had little contact withthe outside world and welcomed very few visitors. The dust billowed into the airabove the surrounding hills, alerting the nuns in advance that we were on ourway. They were waiting for us as we arrived, standing quietly among a crowd ofcurious but shy children, local farmers and yak herders, and weather-hardenednomads.It seems that every photo opportunity in Tibet was what our group members calleda “National Geographic moment,” meaning that a picture capturing it wouldqualify as a cover image for the popular magazine. This moment was no different.Three of the nuns immediately stepped forward and, following a few warmgreetings, informed us that they would be our official guides. These women weredressed in traditional nun’s clothing: a deep maroon wrap (zhen) covering amaroon skirt for the lower body (shemdop) and a yellow and maroon wrapping shirt(dhonka) covering the upper body. The big smiles on their faces and theiranimated conversation told me that they were excited for the opportunity to meetwith us.Through our translator, the nuns confided that living in such an isolatedlocation had its pros and cons. On the one hand, the monastery compound was soremote that government inspectors and land speculators rarely made the effort todisturb their religious community. On the other hand, the nuns were so far fromthe nearest town, so isolated, and the road to get to the monastery was so bad,that the tourism that would normally support the economy of such a place wasalmost nonexistent.Our bus could seat exactly 40 people, plus one guide, a translator, and me.Needless to say, the sight of 43 people converging onto the monastery waswelcomed and immediately brought the courtyard to life as sales kiosks magicallysprang up for business everywhere the eye could see. For an hour or so, ourgroup did our best to support the local economy. We were true consumers, buyingbeautiful Tibetan rugs, brilliantly colored thangkas, and religious aids rangingfrom long ropes hung with prayer flags and huge Tibetan “singing bowls” made ofbrass that could be played with a mallet to strands of prayer beads used tocount the number of times a chant would be repeated.Suddenly the entire scene changed. As if they were following some sort ofinternal cue, the yak wool rugs, turquoise jewelry, singing bowls, and paintingswere packed into big woolen bags, the kiosks were dismantled, and the nuns beganwalking in silence toward the buildings. “We’re going now to the chanting hall,”our tour guide whispered to me as I looked at him for an explanation. “It’s timefor the nuns to pray.”As we walked along a narrow path that was carved into the side of the mountain,one of the nuns came to walk beside me. I was immediately fascinated by herpresence. She was close enough to me that I could easily estimate her height. Mymom is exactly four feet eight inches tall, and the nun’s face was level withthe same place on my chest as my mom’s when we took our walks together. But itwas more than her height that fascinated me.ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS ON EARTH, BUT WHO’S COUNTING?This woman’s eyes were clear and bright, and she had a smile on her face theentire time we were walking together. Though the skin on her face lookedhealthy, I knew that the deep wrinkles around her eyes and across her foreheadcould be present only after a full lifetime of exposure to high-altitude sun,nature’s elements, and the challenges of being a woman in such a harshenvironment. Her head was freshly shaven, but I learned this was due to the lackof indoor plumbing, which made full-body bathing impractical, rather than toloss of hair due to her age. As we walked, it became clear that my Tibetanlanguage skills were far worse than her limited English, and we quickly realizedwe wouldn’t have much of a conversation. Not a verbal one anyway. Together wewalked in silence to the prayer room as she alternated her gaze between lookingdown to the path and then up to meet my eyes.When we reached the door to the chanting hall, with a quick nod the nun pulledback the heavily brocaded tapestry that kept the wind, dust, and bright sunlightout of the prayer space. My new friend stepped inside first, and before I couldfollow, our guide stopped me for a moment.“Did you enjoy your conversation with the geshe?” he asked. Geshe is the Tibetanword for a great teacher, and while I sensed that the woman who had walked withme was a respected elder, I didn’t know why she was held in such high esteem.Furthermore, while my guide casually referred to this nun as geshe, in TibetanBuddhism this title has traditionally been reserved for highly educated malesonly. It was only in 2011, three years after our trip to Tibet, that KelsangWangmo made history by becoming the first officially recognized female geshe,and in doing so signaled a new era of possibility for women in Tibetan Buddhism.I wasn’t prepared for what I heard next. “The nun you were walking with holdsthe memory of this place, and the tradition of these women,” my guide explained.“I called her the geshe because not only does she know the history, she actuallyremembers the history.”“What do you mean ‘she remembers the history’?” I asked. “How is that possible?How can she remember what’s happened in this place for over a hundred years?”“That’s why she is the geshe,” he replied with a grin. Then he looked directlyinto my eyes and revealed the secret of why he wanted me to meet the woman I hadjust walked the trail with.“The nun that you just walked with,” he said, “remembers the history because shelived the history. She was born here in 1888 and has lived in this village allof her life.” At first I thought my guide was teasing me. It quickly becameclear that he wasn’t.“Yes,” he said. “The mother superior showed me her papers. The nun is onehundred and twenty years old this year.” (The year of this particular trip was2008.) “And she’s not the oldest of these people,” he continued. “There areothers here in the mountains that are much older.”“How much older?” I asked.“That’s the problem,” he said. “The oldest ones are men who are now yogis. Theylive in the caves between Lhasa and the sacred mountain, Mount Kailash.According to the local villagers, some of them are six hundred years old! Theproblem is that they did not have birth certificates and passports six hundredyears ago. We cannot prove their age with certainty.”And that’s precisely why I valued my meeting with the Tibetan nun, and thosethat knew her, so much. Her exact age was known, and it could be documentedbecause her records had been preserved in the monastery’s library. She was stillvery much alive, very vibrant, and very happy to talk about her long life andthe secret of achieving it. It was through the translator that afternoon that Iasked what she felt was the secret to her longevity.My new friend didn’t miss a breath as she answered. Quickly, as if on cue, heranswer was simple, brief, and concise. It left no doubt in my mind as to whatshe was telling me. “Compassion,” she replied. “Compassion is life. It’s what wepractice here. It’s what we learn from our masters and what they learn fromtheirs. It’s what’s written in these books.” She gestured to the ancient andtattered manuscripts stored in the monastery library as she spoke. “It’s what wekeep safe to share with those who come here to learn.”With the recent discovery of a biological clock inside each cell that sets the“timer” for how long we live, her answer now makes perfect sense.RETHINKING THE LONGEVITY PARADIGMIt may be no coincidence that the oldest documented ages for people in the worldtoday seem to hover around the age of the nun I met in Tibet. They are at, ornear, the 120-year mark. While there are certainly exceptions with some peoplethat are just under this age, and some that are over, 120 years seems torepresent some kind of a mysterious boundary when it comes to human longevity.From a biblical perspective, it hasn’t always been this way. If we’re to believethe accounts of the Hebrew Torah (subsequently the Christian Old Testament), forexample, the biblical patriarchs lived life spans measuring multiple centuriesrather than mere decades.Methuselah, for example, was 187 years old when he fathered his son Lamech. Sohe was obviously a vital 187 years old at the time he did the fathering.Contradicting the way we’ve been led to think about longevity and how vitalitydiminishes with age, Methuselah lived another 782 years, and during that time hefathered additional sons and daughters, for a stunning life span of 969 years!And Methuselah is not alone in his longevity. The same biblical traditions tellus that at the age of 500 years, Noah “begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”1[endnotes.xhtml#fn131] So once again, to father three children, we know thatNoah had to be both vital and virile.These two accounts portray very different ideas of longevity from what we’reconditioned to expect today. Our society and culture have programmed us toexpect an inverse relationship between age and human potential. That expectationgoes like this: The longer our lives continue, the fewer capabilities of ouryouth are available to us. A corollary to this expectation is the idea thatwhile we’re alive the quality of the life that’s available to us diminishes withthe passing years.It’s for these reasons that when we think of someone being 100 years of age orolder, we are conditioned to think of them as a shell of their former selves.The image is one of a shriveled little human with muscles that have lost theirtone sagging from the brittle bones of a body with dull and empty eyes, clingingto the last possible breath of life. And while this way of aging is certainlypossible, and we’ve all seen this possibility realized somewhere among ourfamilies, friends, and neighbors—and clearly there’s nothing wrong withaccepting this possibility—the point I’m making here is that there’s anotherpossibility. It’s a real possibility of vital longevity and it’s more than awish or a pipe dream. We also have seen examples, both ancient and current, ofpeople who’ve chosen another way of thinking and living that makes extreme andhealthy longevity possible.image [images/img-185-1.png]One of the most curious and fascinating accounts of the long-lived patriarchsthat I mentioned previously is the account of the prophet Enoch and the way heleft this world at the end of his life. I say that he “left this world” ratherthan “died,” because that’s what the historical accounts describe. According tothe biblical texts, Enoch never died.Before the book of Enoch was deleted from the official biblical cannon in the4th century C.E., it held a prominent and revered place in the story ofhumankind. The book that bears Enoch’s name describes how he lived on earth fora total of 365 years, dictating the secrets of creation to a scribe before heleft. However, at the end of his time, the texts describe a passing that is nota typical human death.Rather than expiring with his last breath and his body being returned to theelements, the texts simply say that at the end of his days, “Enoch walked withGod: and he was not; for God took him.”2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn132] It is still atopic of controversy in religious and philosophical circles as to precisely whatthis passage means and what happened to Enoch. I’m sharing the account of hislife because it is another description of a life span that exceeds theexpectations of modern-day people.It’s after the earthly events described in the texts led to a change in the wayhumans would live their lives on earth that the accounts of these centuries-longlife spans end. From that time until today, a ceiling on age was created, and alimitation was placed upon the length of a human life. Perhaps it’s no accidentthat the biblical account of the limit to a human life parallels the scientificdiscovery of just such a limit. The biblical parameter is specific. It reads:“My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet hisdays shall be a hundred and twenty years.”3 [endnotes.xhtml#fn133]The limit of 120 years described in this ancient biblical passage directlyrelates to the scientific discovery of a calculator, found within our DNAitself, that determines how many times a cell can divide before it becomessenescent and eventually dies. Each of us has direct access to our cells’calculator, and the discovery that led to a Nobel Prize in medicine is the keyto how we can reset the clock that determines the life span of our cells.TELOMERE SIZE MATTERSThere’s a new word that’s the buzz of healing and longevity conferences. Fromtelevision commercials that promise age reversal and renewed sexual vigor to adssuggesting that the medicine of tomorrow is a pill that you can buy on theInternet today, the subject that’s suddenly made everyday people sound like DNAexperts is the topic of telomeres. What telomeres are, and what they do for us,is actually quite simple. What they make possible in our lives, however, borderson the miraculous.Similar to the way a small plastic cap protects the ends of our shoelaces sothat they don’t wear out over time, telomeres are special sequences of DNA thatprotect the ends of our chromosomes as our cells repeatedly divide. For humansthe sequence appears as the repeating DNA code TTAGGG, TTAGGG, TTAGGG, and soon. These letters are shorthand for the four possible bases that make up ourDNA: cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T). This sequence isthe “stuff” that forms the protective cap seen in Figure 5.1.image [images/img-187-1.png]Figure 5.1. This illustration shows how the telomeres shorten with each celldivision until they can no longer support the process. Scientists believe thatshortening of our telomeres is the biological clock that leads to old age and,eventually, death.When a cell divides and the chromosomes are copied so two new cells can becreated from the original one (replication), the copying mechanism only reads toa certain point along the DNA and then it stops—before it actually reaches theend of the strand. This is where the telomeres come in. The telomere is a bufferof additional code that appears after the vital information of the chromosome.So when the copying mechanism stops, it stops in the telomeres, where anincomplete copy is harmless, rather than in the DNA information itself. In thisway the telomeres take the brunt of the trauma associated with a cell’sdivision. This is nature’s program to ensure that our genes are copiedcompletely and that the precious information the cell contains remains whole andintact in its descendants.If, for some reason, this mechanism did not exist, the copying would stopsomewhere in the middle of an important DNA instruction—such as informationneeded for creating a strong immune system—and the new cell would have anincomplete blueprint to work from. The incomplete copy would show up as agenetic defect that could lead to disease, illness, senescence, and old age. Butthanks to the telomeres, this doesn’t happen.With this function in mind, it’s clear why the length of our telomeres is soimportant. As long as they remain long enough to keep the DNA code intact, wehave healthy cell division and vital cells that can do what they’re made to do.Key 32: Telomeres are specialized sequences of DNA located at the ends of achromosome that serve as a buffer to protect the chromosome’s geneticinformation when a cell divides. With each cell division, the telomeres becomeshorter, until they can no longer protect the vital information of the cell, atwhich point the cell experiences old age, senescence, and eventually death.There’s a reason that I’m going into this level of detail. Typically the lengthof our telomeres shortens over the course of our lifetimes. For example, at thetime of our birth, our average telomere length is somewhere between 8,000 and13,000 units (base pairs). As we age, they generally become shorter, and they doso in a predictable way. By the age of 35, the telomeres of a typical adult,living a typical Western lifestyle, are reduced by approximately 29 percent, toabout 3,000 units. And when the typical adult reaches the age of 65, that numberdrops another 50 percent, to approximately 1,500 units. I qualify thesestatistics with the word typical because the length of our telomeres is notfixed. It’s not predetermined or “set in stone,” as the saying goes.These statistics describe what happens if we do nothing to support our telomerehealth. The good news is that we can do something. We can do many things. Andfor this reason, scientists now acknowledge that the speed at which, and thedegree to which, our telomeres become shorter depends upon us and a number offactors that we influence through our life choices. These factors includefamiliar things like diet, exercise, and sleep, as well as detrimental factorssuch as the use of drugs and alcohol. They also include the less oftenconsidered factor of emotional stress that can stem from issues of self-esteemand self-worth.DISCOVERING THE TIMER INSIDE OUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCKIn 1961 an American scientist named Leonard Hayflick discovered that the numberof times telomeres will support a cell as it divides is between 40 and 70replications. When his discovery is plotted onto a graph of years of age basedupon how frequently cells divide, we find what is known as the Hayflick limit ofcell division. The Hayflick limit predicts the life span of a cell and thatlimit appears to be the 120 years that we’ve seen in the previous examples. Sowhether we’re looking at human longevity from a biblical perspective or throughthe eyes of a biologist, the questions are the same: * Do we know what causes the limit of 120 years? * Can we transcend the limit of 120 years?In light of the new discoveries described in this book, the answer to both ofthese questions is the same. It’s yes!In 2009 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to threescientists: Elizabeth H. Blackburn and Carol W. Greider, from the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, and Jack W. Szostak, from Harvard Medical School. Theiraward was for the 1984 discovery of an enzyme that is directly linked to thetelomeres in our body—specifically to repairing, rejuvenating, and lengtheningthe telomeres. The name of the enzyme itself tells the story. Called telomerase,it’s associated with the ends of chromosomes, precisely where telomeresthemselves are located. The discovery of the purpose of telomerase is bestdescribed in the press announcement itself:Elizabeth Blackburn and Jack Szostak discovered that a unique DNA sequence inthe telomeres protects the chromosomes from degradation. Carol Greider andElizabeth Blackburn identified telomerase, the enzyme that makes telomere DNA.These discoveries explained how the ends of the chromosomes are protected by thetelomeres and that they are built by telomerase. If the telomeres are shortened,cells age. Conversely, if telomerase activity is high, telomere length ismaintained, and cellular senescence is delayed.4 [endnotes.xhtml#fn134]Key 33: The purpose of the telomerase enzyme in our cells is to repair,rejuvenate, and lengthen the telomeres that determine how long our cells live.The discovery of telomerase suddenly opened the door to vast new possibilitiesof healing and longevity. And as often is the case, before humans were involvedin exploring the potential of this enzyme, the first studies were conducted onlaboratory mice. While a mouse is obviously different from a human biologically,the way a mouse’s cells divide and the way those divisions are regulated is thesame for them as it is for us. It made sense to test the theories of telomerase,and its role in longevity, on mice before trying them out on human volunteers.The results of the studies were nothing less than astounding.A 2010 paper published in the prestigious journal Nature left no doubt in ourminds about what the studies had found. The title of the paper was brief anddirect: “Telomerase Reverses the Aging Process.” The first sentence of the papersets the tone for the possibilities that follow, stating, “Premature aging canbe reversed by reactivating an enzyme [telomerase] that protects the tips of thechromosomes, a study in mice suggests.”5 [endnotes.xhtml#fn135]The Nature paper described how a group of mice were specially treated in a waythat caused them to grow up without telomerase in their bodies while they weredeveloping. The result was that, without the enzyme that could repair theirtelomeres, the chromosome buffers shortened quickly, and the mice aged fasterthan they normally would. Not surprisingly, as the mice aged, they developed thesame kinds of conditions that we commonly associate with human aging, includingdiabetes, osteoporosis, and even neurological conditions.The reason these mice made headlines is because of what happened next. They werealso specially treated to have their telomerase enzymes reactivated when theyreached adulthood. (This is accomplished by using a specific chemical called4-OHT.) After the adult mice were treated for one month, they were evaluated.It’s the conclusions of their evaluation that were described in the paper.The lead researcher described the results as “a near Ponce de Leon effect,”referencing the Spanish explorer and his legendary quest for the Fountain ofYouth. The age-related conditions of the adult mice were not only halted, theywere actually reversed! “Shriveled testes grew back to normal and the animalsregained their fertility,” the paper stated. “Other organs, such as the spleen,liver, and intestines, recuperated from their degenerated state. The one-monthpulse of telomerase also reversed effects of aging in the brain.”6[endnotes.xhtml#fn136]The results of this study have now been replicated and repeated many times andreported in many peer-reviewed scientific journals. Each study approached theaging of cells from a slightly different perspective and tested the role oftelomerase, telomeres, and aging in a slightly different way. And as differentas the studies are from one another, they’re all telling us the same thing. Thepresence of active telomerase in the body is a key factor in stopping andreversing aging and the deterioration that typically comes with the agingprocess.With these studies, for the first time the relationship between telomerase andlongevity was confirmed in mice. Since then, the results have been applied tohumans as well. While factors beyond the length of our telomeres, such aslifestyle, physical environment, and nutrition, certainly contribute to overalllongevity, the correlation between aging and telomere length seems to beundeniable and tells us three things: 1. Longer telomeres are found in people with longer life spans. 2. Telomerase is the enzyme that builds, rejuvenates, and lengthens existing telomeres. 3. Activating the body’s telomerase stops further destruction and repairs telomeres that are already damaged.Telomere length is now accepted as a biological marker—a measurable sign—for howlong a human can be expected to live. And what’s more, we now know that themarker can be influenced, and intentionally changed, in new and positive ways.I want to be absolutely clear, however, that simply making our telomeres longeris not a guaranteed prescription for long life. It would make no sense, forexample, to lengthen telomeres with expectations of longevity while at the sametime indulging in a life of excess that included the chronic use of alcoholand/or recreational drugs, and a diet high in refined carbohydrates, trans fats,and heavily sweetened and fried foods. So while longer telomeres alone do notguarantee long life, researchers have found that only people who have longertelomeres live extended healthy and vital life spans.As you can imagine, the discovery of the three factors listed previouslyregarding telomeres and life expectancy has opened the floodgates for newresearch, an entire new industry of lifestyle coaching, and sales of nutrientand supplement factors designed to lengthen our telomeres, with a promise oflong and healthy life. And while some of the products and techniques are basedin solid science and actually do what their claims suggest, others are not anddo not.Here’s what we know so far.LIFESTYLE FACTORS FOR LONGER TELOMERESFor those of us trying to keep up with the latest research on what constitutes ahealthy lifestyle, tracking the dos and don’ts is enough to make our heads spin.Part of the problem is that the idea of what’s good for us is a moving target;the advice is constantly changing. We’ve seen scientists and medicalprofessionals flip-flop their opinions from the beginning of a year to the endof the same calendar year when it comes to what’s good for us and what’s not.The thinking regarding chicken eggs and coconut oil are perfect examples.Chicken eggs: The old idea. In the 1980s, the cholesterol from chicken eggs wasthought to contribute to unhealthy levels of cholesterol in the blood and,subsequently, to heart and cardiovascular problems. I remember how eggs wereavoided like the plague and how restaurant menus and advertisers went out oftheir way to alert customers that they were offering egg-free recipes.Chicken eggs: The new idea. Now the pendulum has swung in the oppositedirection, as scientists have recognized that the dietary cholesterol containedin eggs is not the cholesterol that contributes to heart disease or raisescardiovascular risk in healthy people.7 [endnotes.xhtml#fn137] Instead, thestudies show that eggs actually raise “good” cholesterol levels (HDL) and reduce“bad” cholesterol levels (LDL). Suddenly, eggs are the “in” food, recognized asnature’s perfect source of protein, iron, healthy fat, and several importantvitamins and minerals, and touted as an important element of a healthy diet. Andeggs are not the only example of a 180-degree shift in the way we think ofcertain foods.Coconut oil: The old idea. Flawed studies that investigated coconut oil in themid-20th century alerted the general public that this was an oil to be avoidedat all costs. For decades I remember ads steering consumers toward othersupposedly “healthy” vegetable oils as an alternative to the natural oil ofcoconuts. Later studies, however, revealed how flawed this thinking was. Theoriginal studies of coconut oil were performed on partially hydrogenated coconutoil rather than the natural oil of raw coconuts, and it turns out that it’s thehydrogenation process that leads to health-related problems and not coconut oilitself.By the way, this is true for any oil that undergoes a hydrogenation process,including commonly used oils such as safflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil,and soy oil. We now know that canola oil, as well, breaks down into harmful freeradicals when heated to temperatures used for cooking above 350 degreesFahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius).Coconut oil: The new idea. Now we know that people who live in parts of theworld where coconuts are a regular part of the diet actually have a lowerincidence of cardiovascular disease than people in countries like the UnitedStates, where whole coconuts and coconut oil have been shunned for at least thepast two generations. Suddenly raw coconut is recognized not only as a healthyfood but as a superfood. Coconut oil in its virgin and extra-virgin forms, aswell as extra-virgin olive oil and virgin avocado oil, are now the recommendedoils of choice.Note: Coconut oil is especially healthy because it holds up well under thehigher temperatures required for cooking.In light of the benefits of these two now-recognized aids to good health,perhaps it’s not surprising that they are also among the foods that promotelongevity and extended telomeres.As I mentioned previously, there is an entire industry of food and dietarysupplements that has emerged touting the ability to heal and lengthen telomeresin recent years. It’s impractical for me to describe each and every suchproduct, supplement, and form of exercise in this book. What I can share,however, is that a few key lifestyle factors have been confirmed as necessaryfor telomere support. In broad categories, these factors include: * Reducing stress * Getting regular exercise * Taking specific supplementsKey 34: Our choices of lifestyle, including specific forms of exercise, specificdietary supplements, and reducing stress in the body, are key strategiesdocumented to successfully slow and even reverse telomere damage and cellularaging.In the remainder of this chapter, I will identify the factors, techniques, andsupplements that I’ve found through my research and personal experience to havethe greatest positive impact on telomeres and aging. And while this list may beused as a guideline, as always, it is important for you to check with yourpersonal health-care provider to see which, if any, may be right for you.THE VITAMIN AND MINERAL CONNECTION: KEY TELOMERE SUPPORT SUPPLEMENTSThere are a variety of synergistic vitamins and minerals that can contribute tohealthy DNA and prevent premature shortening of telomeres. In a study publishedby the Journal of Nutrition, the results showed that men having the longesttelomeres also had high concentrations of very specific vitamins and minerals intheir blood.8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn138]Among the supplements described in the Journal of Nutrition study are thefollowing. Please note: Some of the following supplements are identified in thesmaller units of micrograms (mcg) and some in the larger units of milligrams(mg).Supplement Recommended Amount Vitamin B12 500–1,000 mcg/day Folate 800 mcg/dayVitamin C 1,000–3,000 mg/day Vitamin E tocotrienols 40 mg/day Zinc 25–50 mg/dayMagnesium 400–800 mg/dayThe entire family of B vitamins is positively linked to longer telomeres.Additional studies have also noted beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin D, and themineral iron as necessary factors for the development and maintenance of DNA andthe prevention of premature telomere shortening. A plant-based diet rich inantioxidants and phytonutrients derived from green, leafy vegetables has beenshown to be directly related to longer telomere length and healthier DNA.THE STRESS-TELOMERE CONNECTIONEven before molecular biologist Carol Greider, Ph.D., and her team discoveredthe enzyme telomerase and identified its ability to reverse the shortening oftelomeres, scientists were hot on the track of the role that telomeresthemselves play in the aging process. The title of a paper published by theNational Academy of Sciences in 2004 sums up the telomere-stress relationship:“Accelerated Telomere Shortening in Response to Life Stress.” And although thetitle sounds a bit complex, the message of the paper is not. In clear andconcise terms, the paper leaves no doubt in our minds as to the role of stressin the aging process, stating, “Chronic stress erodes telomeres, impairs DNAreplication, and thus accelerates aging.”9 [endnotes.xhtml#fn139]The key in this consideration of stress is the word chronic. This is the kind ofstress that goes on and on with no resolution, and this is an importantdistinction when it comes to the way we think of stress in our lives.Each of us experiences some form of stress related to something that we eithera) need for survival, such as food, water, or medical attention; b) need toproduce in an office or work environment; or c) experience as a problem we needto resolve in our personal or work relationships. Interestingly, differentpeople interpret different life events as different kinds of stress.We’ve all heard of constructive stress, for example. This is the kind of stressthat creative people often feel in response to a deadline or the pressure ofcreating or producing something to meet a specific goal or need. An artist underthe stress of creating paintings for a gallery opening, an office workercreating the financial reports that are due at the end of the quarter, an authorwriting to meet a publishing deadline, and a scientist solving the problem ofhow to save precious power in an orbiting space capsule that is desperately lowon energy (as in the Apollo 13 story) are all examples of situations that leadto constructive stress.Each of these stress situations has a beginning that can be identified and anend that can be recognized and met. In these situations the primary stresshormones of adrenaline, norepinephrine, and cortisol become the fuel to kickcreativity and problem solving into high gear. As new solutions appear, the goalappears to be within reach, the sense of being stressed eases, and the stresshormones dissipate.Herein lies the key to constructive stress: It’s temporary and the effect of thestress chemistry is typically short-lived. As we near our goal, we may say thatwe “see the light at the end of the tunnel.” The fact that there is a light,that we feel ourselves getting closer to it, and that the heightened effects ofstress upon the body are short-lived is what makes our creative stress apositive experience.This is much different from the way we feel when we’re in a demanding ordifficult situation that seems to have no light at the end of the tunnel, no endto the stress. And when a situation seems especially hopeless, sometimes wecan’t even see the tunnel itself, which would make movement toward the light atits end possible. Working for a big company where we feel like we’re just anumber on a spreadsheet in some executive’s office, for example, can create thiskind of stress. In such a situation, it’s obvious that no matter how hard wework each day or how innovative we are while we’re working, the currentconditions that are frustrating, unhealthy, or even hurtful probably aren’tgoing to change. No matter what we do, how hard we work, or how good our workis, our frustration remains unresolved. It’s under conditions like these thatstress can become chronic and harmful.The sense of helplessness from this kind of experience triggers a chemicalreaction in our body that’s called the fight-or-flight response. In this modeour biological impulse for survival kicks in and triggers higher levels of thestress hormones mentioned previously to prepare us to do one or the other:either fight our way to safety or run like hell until we’ve escaped the threat.And while this kind of response would have served us if we were fleeing from asaber-toothed tiger at the end of the last ice age, in the office or homeenvironment today it gives us a completely different kind of experience.ANCIENT STRESS IN THE MODERN WORLDWhen our ancestors successfully escaped a saber-toothed tiger and they werecatching their breath while resting behind a big rock, for at least a moment theimmediate trigger for their stress was resolved. The levels of stress hormonesin their bodies would begin to decline as their heartbeats slowed and returnedto normal. And after a few hours of relative safety, they would have metabolizedthe high levels of these hormones from their bodies.In this type of dangerous situation, our stress hormones serve us well by beingavailable when we need them in high amounts for brief periods of time. But thisscenario is not what typically happens in our lives today. In the modern world,we’re usually not physically chased by another animal that is threatening ourlives. Instead, our stress often comes from finding ourselves in situationswhere we feel trapped, vulnerable, and helpless. And in these cases, theresolution is not as cut-and-dried as successfully eluding a hungry animal.This is where the problem arises. On the one hand, the body is revved up withthe primal chemicals to run, hide, or fight, while on the other hand, we usuallycan do none of these. It’s like we’re in a car with one foot pressing on thegas, ready to go, and the other foot on the brakes at the same time. The engineis revved to the max and we’re not moving.When the source of our stress is the secure job that pays our bills yet we hatewith a passion, or it’s the 15-year-long relationship that we feel trapped inbut that provides security for us and our children, we can’t run and we can’thide. At least not in the way our ancestors did when they found refuge behind arock.In the modern world, where is our rock to hide behind? If we haven’t discovereda way to feel safe and relieve the stress of daily life, studies tell us thatthe unresolved stress will begin showing up in ways that negatively impact ourtelomeres. And while the science that describes this relationship is clear, theeffects of the stress are obvious even without the science.When someone we know is stuck in the throes of unresolved emotional turmoil—asthey would be during a long and drawn-out divorce, or if they are unable to makea decision whether to continue a job or relationship or to end it, forexample—we see the toll the stress takes on them. We see it in their agingbodies and in their aged faces. They look older than their years and typicallystart to have health problems that would normally not be seen until years, evendecades, later in their lives. When people are chronically stressed, theirimmune systems are often not prepared for the cold and flu that invariablysweeps through the office or the classroom each year.These are the people who must use all of the sick days they have and then needeven more. And ultimately, these are the people who succumb to stress as itsteals from them the very thing they cherish most: life itself. In the presenceof long-term, chronic, unresolved stress, their bodies can only hold up for solong.Staying healthy all comes down to our ability to give the body the environmentit needs to do what it is designed to do—heal—and do so at the most fundamentallevel of DNA itself.Key 35: It’s the unresolved stress in our lives that erodes our telomeres andsteals from us the very thing we cherish most: life itself.DIVERSIONS: HEALTHY AND NOTOur instinct is typically to do whatever we can to avoid facing situations wherewe feel there’s no resolution. So we create diversions in our lives that takeour attention away from the issue, or issues. We can engage in healthydiversions, such as yoga, meditation, individual or group sports, art, or music,to channel our stress. Too often, however, the diversions we opt for are lesshealthy choices, such as eating when we’re not hungry, using drugs or alcohol tonumb our unpleasant emotions, or resorting to online video games or even videorelationships in place of in-person interactions. When we choose theseactivities, it’s often a way of diverting our focus from feeling the emotionsassociated with the stress.When we become addicted to the release of the chemicals in our bodies that ourdiversions create—such as serotonin and oxytocin, which improve our mood—theactivities that produce them will become our chronic go-to escapes. We’lleventually feel addicted to them. And unless we find a way to resolve theunderlying stress itself, over time such diversions can replace our friendships,jobs, family, and other primary relationships as our sources of good feelings.This is what the paper from the National Academy of Sciences is saying to us.And it’s also telling us precisely how chronic stress is harming us: byshortening the telomeres that protect the code of life that lives in each cellof our bodies. The good news is that the same science that tells us chronicstress hurts us also tells us how we can resolve that stress.EXERCISEDiscovering and Resolving Your Unresolved StressThe science is clear: Unresolved stress can shorten the telomeres that arecrucial to your health, healing, and longevity. I’ve created a concise templateto help you to identify this kind of stress in your life. I’ve found this simpletemplate to be particularly useful when you feel a sense that something isbothering you, yet have been unable to clearly identify what that something is.I invite you to take this opportunity to clarify any stressors that you may beexperiencing in your life at this moment. You’ll need paper and pen for thisexercise.The Technique: Using single words or brief phrases, please write down youranswers to the following three questions as honestly as you can.Question 1: What are some of the sources of your unresolved stress? Pleaseidentify, as honestly as you can, any relationships, conditions, or situationsin your life that create a lingering sense of anxiety and frustration or a deep,emotional, “gut” response of uncertainty when you think of them. Make a list,reserving a few lines of space below each source you identify.Question 2: What is your typical response to your stress? In the space beloweach source of stress, I invite you to identify diversions you typically relyupon. Finish the following sentence: “When this situation triggers feelings ofanxiety, frustration, or any other deep emotion that is uncomfortable, to feelbetter I typically . . .”Question 3: What would you like to be your new and more thoughtful response toyour stressors? If you’d like to replace your current diversions for the sourcesof stress you’ve identified with new and more thoughtful responses, pleasefollow the following strategy. It begins with making a familiar shift to askyour heart’s wisdom for guidance. You’ll recognize the steps here for creatingheart focus as similar to the Quick Coherence® Technique described in Chapter 5[chapter05.xhtml]. * Step 1: Establish a heart focus. Allow your awareness to move from your mind to the area of your heart. * Step 2: Slow your breathing. Begin to breathe a little slower than usual, taking approximately five to six seconds to inhale and the same to exhale. * Step 3: Access your deep intuition. As you continue to breathe and hold your awareness in your heart, silently ask your question from within. * Step 4: Listen/feel. Listen for the answer. When you’ve got one, write your heart’s wisdom below. Finish this sentence: “Examples of more thoughtful responses to my unresolved life stress include . . .”The purpose of this exercise is twofold. Use it to: * Develop an awareness of the diversions that you turn to, both consciously and unconsciously, when you’re faced with stressful situations that seem to have no resolution. * Replace any diversions that may not be serving you with new and healthier responses to the stressors in your life. The key to the power of this exercise is that although we may not always be able to change the situation immediately, we can immediately shift our response to it.As you complete the exercise above, I invite you to bear in mind that there isno correct or incorrect way of receiving your heart’s wisdom. Each of us is bornwith our own unique code that allows us to access our heart’s wisdom and applyit in our lives. The secret to the code is to know what works best for you.Key 36: Through our heart’s wisdom, we can ask for and receive insights intohealthy alternatives to the unhealthy diversions in our life.WE AFFIRM OR DENY OUR LIVES IN EACH MINUTE OF EVERY DAYIf we embrace a way of living that constantly fills our “tank of life,” asMichael described it, then we constantly replenish the vitality of our cells.When we do so, our telomeres continue to heal, grow, and divide in a way thatreflects that vitality. While the instructions for this kind of thinking andliving are simple, to implement them is where the real workshop of life begins.It takes courage. It takes discipline. And it requires a choice that we mustmake in each moment of every day of our lives.Through the choices we make in each moment of every day—the food that we chooseto nourish our bodies, the movements that we choose to stimulate our bodies, thewords that we choose to express our thoughts and experiences, and the beliefsthat we harbor about ourselves and other people—we either affirm or deny life inour bodies. As we embrace the fact of this reality, our choice becomes simple.It’s based in the mindful decision to choose life in every word, through eachmeal, and in every interaction that we have with ourselves, with other people,and with the world at large. This key to longevity is no secret to students ofthe mystery traditions, such as the ancient Essenes, a religious sect thatflourished from the 2nd century B.C.E. until the 1st century C.E. throughout theland that today includes parts of Palestine, Jordan, and Israel.10[endnotes.xhtml#fn140] Perhaps the most widely recognized Essene today is theNew Testament master Jesus of Nazareth.Jesus described the choice of life that we make each day to his students in away that made sense to them, in the vernacular of their day. When they asked himhow they could heal their bodies, Jesus replied in a way that was direct,simple, and eloquent: “If you eat living food, the same will quicken you, but ifyou kill your food, the dead food will kill you also. For life comes only fromlife, and from death comes always death. For everything which kills your foodskills your bodies also.”11 [endnotes.xhtml#fn141]The best science of the modern world is telling us that these direct, powerful,and eloquent words are just as true today as they were 2,000 years ago. When weeat foods that are heavily processed, overcooked, or laden with preservatives,we’re eating food in which the vitality of the enzymes and the life thatnourishes us has been killed.An accepted definition of food is “any nutritious substance that people oranimals eat or drink, or that plants absorb, in order to maintain life andgrowth.”12 [endnotes.xhtml#fn142] From this definition we can see that what arecommonly called processed foods are actually not foods at all. While they mayfill the space in our stomachs and ease our hunger, because the components thatgo into these fast meals are already dead when they’re packaged, they cannotgive life to our bodies when we eat them.So it comes as no surprise that popular diets consisting of fast foods ladenwith hydrogenated oils, processed ingredients, preservatives, and artificialcolors and flavoring are implicated in the epidemic of illnesses that aresweeping the modern world, such as diabetes, dementia, and various cancers. Itmakes perfect sense when we consider that we may be relying upon nonfoods togive nutrition to our bodies.And as powerful as this realization is for our diet, the same principle appliesto the choices we make beyond what we eat. It applies to what we believe aboutourselves and other people, to our relationships, and to our self-esteem. Eachof these is a spiritual food for our minds and hearts that nourishes us in someway. To build upon the wisdom of the Essene teachings with these ideas in mind,we can take them one step further and say, “For everything which kills yoursense of value, self-worth, and self-esteem kills your body also.”Clearly, the quality of our emotional, psychological, and spiritual nutrition isjust as important as the nutrition from the physical food that we eat.The key here is that the quality of each of the telomere-healing experiences inour lives is based upon the choices we make. Sometimes we make our choicesconsciously and with intention. Sometimes our choices are unconscious.Regardless, they are always our choices. The key to longevity is to turn ourconscious choices into subconscious habits. When we do this, we no longer needto stop and ponder what we’ll eat for lunch or how we’ll respond to a lovers’quarrel. The reason is that we’ve already chosen.I learned this lesson for myself early in my life and it has become theframework for the majority of choices I make each and every day. Each day, witheach meal I choose, with each friendship, partnership, and relationship I’minvolved in, and when I find myself criticizing another person or myself forsomething I’ve said or done, I ask the same question: Is this the best that Ihave to offer in this moment? The answer to this question in the moment tells mewhat my possibilities are—and it’s at that point that I must make a choice thataffirms or denies the very life in my body.With the relationships between nutrition, beliefs, stress, and telomeres inmind, it’s clear that longevity is actually less about trying to see how long wecan live and more the product of a choice that we make in each moment of everyday. This choice is what my conversation with my friend Michael was all about.It’s the difference between thinking of ourselves as finite vessels of limitedpotential and thinking of ourselves as infinite vessels of unlimited potential.That’s the difference that would make it possible to become a father at the ageof 500 years.Key 37: In each moment of every day, we make the choices that affirm—ordeny—life in our bodies.TIME, LIFE, AND THE AGING CLOCKDuring the years that I was leading groups in Tibet, I noticed a phenomenon thatis rarely discussed in textbooks or travel documentaries. It’s simply that theTibetan monks and nuns typically don’t track their age. The first time I asked aTibetan monk his age, his initial response was to begin laughing. He wasn’tlaughing at my poor Tibetan language skills; rather, he was laughing at thequestion I’d just asked. He didn’t believe it was a serious question, because inhis way of thinking, age doesn’t have the same meaning that we give to it in ourculture.After the monk realized I’d asked a serious question, he was more than happy toanswer me. His delay in responding wasn’t because his age was some kind ofsecret. It was because he simply didn’t know. Tracking the passing of each yearin his life wasn’t important to him.While the monks celebrate their birthdays, they don’t actually track their age.They celebrate the successful completion of another revolution around the sunrather than counting how many years have passed since they were born. From theprevious sections, we know that the consequences of this way of thinking areclearly positive. If the expectation is that our quality of life declines witheach passing year, and that counting the years we’ve lived affirms our aging,then it makes sense that the monks would want to avoid tracking their age.My monk friend certainly knew the year he was born. And with that date in mind,he began his answer to me by first asking me a question in turn. “What is theyear now, today?” he asked. When I replied that the year was 2008, he nodded hisunderstanding. He looked at his open palm and began scribbling invisible numberswith his index finger. He was calculating the difference between the year I’djust stated and the year that he was born. Quickly he looked up at me with a biggrin and proudly told me that he was born in 1915. By his calculation he’d beenin the world for 93 years.His answer more than surprised me. If I was being paid to estimate the age ofthis man, from the color and tightness of his skin, the sparkle in his eyes andthe bounce in his every step, I would have guessed that he was maybe in hismid-60s or possibly his early 70s. But there is no way that I would have placedhim in his 90s! Just as the nun at the monastery had demonstrated, this monk hadshown me that the number of years we’re in this world and the condition of ourbodies are not necessarily linked in the way I’d been taught to expect.The lesson I learned from the monk was about time.AGING DOESN’T MEAN OLD AGE!If we set the timer on our cell phone for 60 minutes, at the end of the 60minutes, we will all have been on the earth for one hour more than we were whenwe set the timer. The 60 minutes marks the chronological time that’s lapsedsince we set the timer. And while we will have clearly lived through each andevery one of those 60 minutes, the question will be, how did we live them? Whileour cells have lived and metabolized during that hour, did they also heal andrejuvenate during that time? And perhaps more importantly, did we give our cellsthe environment to heal and rejuvenate? Our answer to this question is thedifference between longevity and old age.The very nature of this question goes back to the philosophy at the beginning ofthis chapter. Do we believe that we begin to die from the moment we’re born, ordo we accept that the moment of our birth triggers the healing process that isnatural and inherent in our bodies’ existence? To make this more personal, doyou believe that from the moment of your birth you’ve been healing andrejuvenating?The key to what the Tibetan monk demonstrated in his answer to me is that hedidn’t tell me he was “93 years old.” He didn’t claim to have used up 93 yearsof his finite tank of life. What he told me was simply that 93 years had passedsince he came into this world. In other words, he stated the fact of hislongevity without affirming the consequences of his age. This subtle way ofhonestly acknowledging our time on earth has powerful implications when it comesto the age clock in our cells. It’s the key to the longevity and quality of lifethat I found at first with the monks and nuns in Tibet.Since I’ve learned to recognize this philosophy, I’ve now seen it in manyindigenous traditions that are less influenced than the Western world bythoughts of life, death, and longevity.One of my lifelong passions has been the study of people living to advanced ageswho have done so in a healthy way. My search has been to discover the commondenominators that are shared by the oldest people in the world. When the monkstold me that there are yogis who are 600 years of age, as remarkable as theclaim was, I actually felt I had no reason to doubt them. The new discoveries ofmodern science certainly suggest that such advanced ages are possible, andancient writing tells us that humans have reached these ages and survived evenbeyond them!What’s most important to me about these stories is that when these peoplefinally arrive at the end of their centuries-long lives, they don’t fit thecontemporary idea of what a person of such an age should look like. What I meanis that they don’t look like the image of a shriveled body of wrinkled skinhanging on a fragile skeleton that we often associate with advanced age. Justthe opposite. These people, like the nun I met in Tibet in 2008, have bright andfocused eyes, healthy and supple skin, and extremely active lives. They’revital, fully enabled, and fully capacitated humans, enjoying their lives to thefullest and contributing to their families and communities to the end of theirdays.And while we don’t have documentation for the yogis that my guide described, wedo have documentation for one man who lived to a near-biblical age in relativelyrecent times. One of the most fascinating, extreme, and best-documented examplesof reaching a biblically old age is a man who served in the Chinese military andwas honored by the military for his 100th, 150th, and 200th birthdays, LiChing-Yuen.THE MYSTERY OF LI CHING-YUENLi Ching-Yuen was a Chinese martial artist and qigong master who lived on a dietof high-altitude herbs, served in the Chinese military, and died at the advancedage of 256 years. The detailed military records of the Chinese army indicatethat Li was born in Sichuan, China, in 1677. His entry into military service asa tactical advisor in 1749 is well documented, as well as is his retirement 25years later at the age of 97. In his retirement, he resumed the simple rurallifestyle that he had led before his military service. I believe that thischoice of lifestyle was one of the keys to his longevity. He returned to thehigh mountains of China’s Sichuan Province to grow, harvest, and sustain a dietof medicinal herbs just as he’d done before his military service.In recognition of his distinguished military career, Li received a letter ofacknowledgment for his service. Accompanying the letter was an additionaldocument of good wishes congratulating him on his 100th birthday. The year was1777. The military acknowledged him again in 1827 on his 150th birthday, and yetagain in 1877 on his 200th birthday. This mysterious man of longevity isreported to have died in 1933. I have to say that he is “reported” dead becausein the rural setting of his hometown, his body was never seen and his familynever buried him. According to his wife, he simply died while he was innature.13 [endnotes.xhtml#fn143]image [images/img-210-1.png]Figure 5.2. A rare photograph of Li Ching-Yuen taken in Sichuan in 1927, whenhis documented age was 250. Records from his military service indicate that hewas born in 1677 and died in 1933. At the time of his death, he is believed tohave been 256 years of age. Source: Public domain, People’s Republic of China /WikipediaIn 1933 both Time magazine and The New York Times published articles about LiChing-Yuen containing interviews with descendants from the village where he hadgrown up.14 [endnotes.xhtml#fn144] The articles described the memories of adultswho had known Li in their childhood, but their accounts were shared by thegrandchildren of these adults. At the time of his death, Li was credited with180 children from 14 marriages. When he was asked to what he attributed hislongevity, Li said he believed that the secret to his long life was to “have aquiet heart.”15 [endnotes.xhtml#fn145] In light of the new discoveries regardingthe effects of a heart-focused life, Li’s words make perfect sense.The reason I’m sharing this account and my experience with the Tibetan nun whowas 120 years of age when we met is not about their age specifically. While theadvanced ages of these people are clearly impressive, really it’s theexceptional condition of their bodies at the time of their age that’s the pointof this discussion. Both people illustrate an exception to the thinking that “webegin to die the moment we’re born.” In fact, they seem to support thepossibility that I shared with my friend Michael.It’s only through a process of continuous healing—a rejuvenation that begins atthe DNA level of life itself—that it’s possible to achieve such remarkably oldages.I would have loved to have a conversation with Li Ching-Yuen before he left thisworld. I would have asked him the same questions that come to anyone’s mind whenwe hear of life spans that challenge our belief systems: about diet, exercise,and lifestyle. Unfortunately, Li passed two decades before I was born, so Imissed my opportunity.LONGEVITY: THE COMMON THREADIn 2008, the Associated Press carried the story of Mariam Amash, an Arab-Israeliwoman from the village of Jisr az-Zarka in northern Israel. She was flagged at asecurity checkpoint that year, reportedly because her identification papers hadexpired. She was told that she needed to go to the local authorities to have herdocuments updated and renewed. That’s when she made worldwide headlines. She wasissued new documents that showed her date of birth. Mariam’s confirmed birthdatewas 1888, meaning she was 120 years of age at the time her story madeheadlines!16 [endnotes.xhtml#fn146]When she was asked what she attributed her health and long life to, Mariamdidn’t need to think long before she answered: It was love. She felt that thelove she had for her family—the love she felt for her children, hergrandchildren, her great-grandchildren, and her great-great-grandchildren—waswhat kept her alive for so many years. She felt important in their lives. Shecared for them. She cooked for them. She counseled them in life. And each ofthese experiences contributed to one overarching positive factor: Mariam feltneeded. She felt that she was contributing to the lives of the people she lovedin a way that they needed. And it was this feeling that drew her to a full lifeeach and every day.In 2012, one of her grandsons reported to the press that Mariam had not beenfeeling well. She was taken to Israel’s renowned Hillel Yaffe Medical Center, inthe city of Hadera, for observation and treatment. Only three days later,without a prolonged illness, Mariam passed away quietly, surrounded by herfamily. At the time of her death she was 124 years of age and had 10 childrenand approximately 300 descendants. I’m sharing this story because, similar to LiChing-Yuen, Mariam led a vital and healthy life up until the very end.When we think about the examples of the three people that I’ve described, LiChing-Yuen, Mariam Amash, and the Tibetan nun, a single through-line becomesimmediately obvious. All three of these people attributed their longevity topositive, heart-based experiences. Knowing this, it should come as no surprisethat the positive experiences of a peaceful heart and of being loved—of feelingloved and needed—would impact these people’s bodies in a powerful and positiveway. It’s the new science-based discoveries, however, that give us thespecifics. And when we understand the precise relationship between ourperception of life’s experiences and longevity, we also discover how to awakenthat ability consciously in our own lives.Every organ in the human body, it is now documented, has the ability toregenerate and heal, including the organs that we’ve been told in the past areincapable of doing so. Heart tissue, brain tissue, spinal-cord tissue,pancreatic tissue, and even nerve connections are all now documented as havingthe ability to repair themselves and heal damage they’ve sustained, and to do sousing the body’s own healing mechanisms. The discovery of telomerase tells uswhy this universal healing is possible.The key is that we must create the right conditions—the right environment insideand outside our bodies—to trigger such healing. These conditions can include thephysical environment of our surroundings, the chemical environment of our bloodand cells, and the emotional environment that triggers our heart and brainfunctions. This discovery has opened the door to a new reality in biology and anew way of thinking about life, which begins with the discovery of cells thatcan live forever—the first immortal cells.THE FIRST IMMORTAL CELLSWhen the 2009 Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of telomerase, it waslike the last missing piece of a puzzle had dropped into place for longevityresearch. Biology textbooks have historically shown an illustration similar toFigure 5.1, where telomeres become shorter and shorter each time a cell divides.And because the number of times cells can divide was thought to be limited(known as the Hayflick limit), cells were said to be mortal. It was believedthey had a life span that could be calculated, and the number of times the cellcould divide could be predicted.With the discovery of telomerase, however, and its ability to extend the lengthof telomeres and the life of the cell, a new class of immortal cells had to becreated. The reason for this name is that the cells are not bound by theHayflick limit. In theory, as long as the telomeres continue to be healed andreplaced, a cell can continue to live, grow, and thrive. And in theory, thisprocess could happen indefinitely, making the cell immortal. While the idea ofimmortal cells may sound like science fiction, the reality is that they alreadyexist. And the fact of their existence is not a recent achievement either. Thefirst immortal cells were discovered in 1951. And the shocking truth is thatthose cells are still alive and reproducing themselves in laboratories today,some 65 years after they were first recognized.In 1951, a doctor at Johns Hopkins hospital created a cell culture from tissuetaken from a young woman who had cervical cancer. In her particular instance, aswith many cancers, the body’s naturally programmed cell death that normallykills defective cells before they become a problem—apoptosis—was not working.Rather than killing off the cells that had not divided properly, her body wassending a signal to do just the opposite. It was producing telomerase to keepall of her cells alive and reproducing, including the defective ones. This iswhy the doctor made a laboratory culture from a sample of the woman’s cells. Hewanted to understand why the unhealthy cells continued to live and reproduce inthis manner.The woman’s name was Henrietta Lacks, and her cells continue to reproduce astissue cultures today. The original culture that the doctor created in 1951keeps perpetuating itself, and the cells that it produces are studied throughoutthe world in classrooms and medical research laboratories. They’re known as theHeLa cell line, to honor the name of their donor. In theory the HeLa cells maylive forever.In Henrietta’s case, something unknown triggered a blanket release of telomerasein her body in 1951. It could have been an environmental toxin. It could havebeen her body reacting to an additive or a preservative that was used inmid-20th century products that no longer exist. It could have been aconcentration of heavy metals in her environment. What’s important here is thefact that Henrietta Lacks’s cells are still alive and will continue to reproduceas long as a constant supply of telomerase is present.ARE WE REALLY READY FOR IMMORTAL CELLS?The existence of Henrietta Lacks’s perpetually dividing cells has taken the ideaof cell immortality from a textbook theory to a physical reality. The questionis no longer whether or not it’s possible to produce ever-living cells. Now thequestion is whether or not this immortality can be safely induced in a healthyhuman through diet, exercise, nutrition, and supplements. And if the answer isyes, then the question that follows is more of a philosophical one: Are wereally ready for immortality and what it means in our lives? Are we emotionallyprepared to live extended lives where we outlive everything that’s familiar andeveryone we love? The answer to this question is something that scientists arenow seriously considering. They need to, because it appears that we’ll needthose answers sooner rather than later.Throughout recorded human history, and possibly even before, our lives followedan unspoken pattern when it comes to relationships, career, and family.Historically, the pattern has gone something like this: Sometime after the endof childhood, which is considered to be as early as puberty in some societies,we organize our lives by working to define a career path. We seek out a lifepartner, and some people begin to create families. As we have our own childrenand guide them through their formative years, the natural order has been for usto live a full life—and if we are fortunate enough, to become grandparents—andthen, due to the complications of aging, to pass on, leaving the fruits of ourlives for the next generation.Our society is geared toward this progression, which is commonly known as thenatural order of life. The structure of our careers, retirement, Social Securityaccounts, and medical insurance plans are all based upon statistics projectinghow far into the future we are expected to live and how we will need to drawupon their support. These statistics reflect the average among our peers andwithin the natural order. Today, expectations are changing. As technology,hygiene, and workplace safety have improved over the years, life spans haveincreased, and the statistics are reflecting that change.For example, in 1930 the average life expectancy for a man was 58 years and fora woman it was 62 years. The difference between these ages is commonlyattributed to the hazards of factories, underground mines, and the toll of war,which affect men differently than they do women, as well as the tendency forcardiovascular problems to affect men earlier in life.Interestingly, the retirement age in 1930 was 65, meaning the expectation wasthat most people would work their entire lifetimes, without ever experiencingthe benefits of an official retirement or receiving a payout from a socialprogram. Fortunately, improved standards of work and living have changed thesenumbers significantly. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, in1990 if a man survived the stress and perils of life and career to live untilage 65 and then retired, he could expect to live an additional 15.3 yearsfollowing his retirement. For women, the statistics are even better. In 1990 awoman could expect to live for an average of 19.6 years after her retirement,4.3 years longer than her male counterpart.17 [endnotes.xhtml#fn147] Even inlight of these new statistics, for the most part the natural order of life hasremained intact in developed nations.When it comes to families, a similar progression is assumed. The expectation isthat parents provide for their children while they’re maturing, and when theparents die, they leave their material wealth and the fruits of their lives fortheir children to enjoy. Our partnerships and marriages are based upon this samemodel and progression. When we make a lifetime commitment in marriage, forexample, we assume that we’re committing to a life span within the historicrange of life expectancy. The possibility of immortality, or even a lifetimethat’s extended by 100 years or so, changes all of this. Honestly, how manypeople would commit to a lifetime with a single partner if they knew in advancethey would live 200 years? Or how about 500 years? Or achieve immortality?And while it’s possible to adjust the nuts and bolts of the material world—suchas finances, insurance, and jobs—to accommodate longer lives, perhaps thegreatest challenge for someone living a lifetime measured in centuries is theemotional toll of the losses that they would experience over the course of theirlong life. In a multicentury lifetime, there is a very real possibility that theperson living that long would lose everything they’ve known and everyone they’veloved. They would experience the loss of friends, family, partners, and lovers,and each loss would need to be acknowledged and healed in some way. This wouldbe especially hard when it comes to parents and their children. Psychology Todaydescribes the emotional impact of a parent outliving their children:Producing greater stress than dealing with the death of a parent or spouse, achild’s death is especially traumatic because it is often unexpected as well asbeing in violation of the usual order of things in which the child is expectedto bury the parent. The emotional blow associated with child loss can lead to awide range of psychological and physiological problems including depression,anxiety, cognitive and physical symptoms linked to stress, marital problems,increased risk for suicide, pain, and guilt.18 [endnotes.xhtml#fn148]In addition to the loss of loved ones, a person living a multicentury life wouldalso experience the loss of neighborhoods, communities, and entire ways of lifeand living, as the world would continue to grow and evolve, changingdramatically during an extended life span. It’s this very scenario that has longconcerned scientists when they think of astronauts journeying on multidecademissions to other worlds, when the phenomenon of time dilation predicted inEinstein’s equations becomes a very real factor. Space travelers’ families andfriends on earth would continue to age at the normal rate, while those aboard aspacecraft, due to the speed they would be traveling, would age more slowly thantheir earthly counterparts. (This is one of the implications of Einstein’s E =mc2 formula.) Assuming that they survived their decades-long mission, when theyreturned to Earth, they would be much younger—depending upon how long they wereaway and how fast they were traveling—than the people they left behind.While none of the scenarios I’m mentioning here is necessarily a showstopperwhen it comes to extended life spans, they all offer a hint of what’s involvedwith the experience of longevity in a way that goes beyond simply keeping cellsalive. It all comes down to our perceptions and how we feel about the changingworld around us.I experienced a taste of this for myself with my grandfather before his passing.KEEPING UP WITH THE WORLDAs I mentioned previously, my father left our family when I was 10. My mother’sfather became more of a father to me after my dad’s departure, and I was closerto him than I was to my biological father. Though my grandfather and I had verydifferent world views, he was always open to new ideas, willing to listen to myconcerns, and happy to share his wisdom when I asked—or when I needed it most.While I didn’t know it would be the last week of his life, I was with mygrandfather the week he died. He had just turned 96 and we had a small familycelebration to acknowledge the experiences of his lifetime.As the celebration was winding down, I pulled my grandfather over to a quiettable and asked him to tell me about his 96 years of living and what it meant tohim. Having left the noise of the party in another room, he began by taking adeep breath as he raised his eyebrows and rolled his eyes at the magnitude ofwhat I’d just asked. “There was a time when the world made sense to me,” hesaid. He then described how he had understood the world and how things worked,and prided himself in his masterful ability to fix things when they needed to befixed. This included repairing the engine on his own car as well as the cars ofhis friends and relatives, maintaining the coal-burning furnace in his family’sbasement through the tough Missouri winters, and always being able to work forwhat he had, even during the Great Depression of 1929, and pay cash for his homeand furniture without ever receiving any handouts from anyone. This time he wastalking about, when the world made sense, was in the 20th century, just afterWorld War I.“Then something changed,” he said, “and the world didn’t make sense to meanymore. I couldn’t keep up with the changes.” Grandpa could never put hisfinger on any one item that was responsible for the changes that left himfeeling like an outsider. “It was everything,” he said. “Everything changed!”Just after World War II, the fruits of wartime technology began to trickle downinto everyday life. From jet planes and telecommunication systems—like faxmachines—to entirely new kinds of medicine and entirely new industries, thegadgets and ways of life that emerged after World War II worked on principlesthat my grandfather simply didn’t understand.In addition to the flood of new technology, the world was full of new nations aswell. Many of them had not existed before the war. (These were nations such asIsrael, Jordan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Nepal.) Grandpa could never understand howone day a nation didn’t exist, and then the next day, with the stroke of a pen,suddenly it did. All of this left my grandfather with a sense that he didn’t fitinto the world any longer—that he didn’t belong. At the age of 96, he couldn’treconcile the changes in the world within the context of his own life.I wasn’t with my grandfather when he died later that week. I received a phonecall while I was at work letting me know that after his lunch, Grandpa had takena nap in his favorite chair while watching daytime TV, with the brim of hisUniversity of Missouri ball cap pulled over his face, and he never woke up. Hiswas a peaceful transition, and I’ve always been grateful for that—and that Iasked him my questions about his life when I did. Sadly, my grandfather diedfeeling like a stranger in the world he grew up in. I think of him often andwhat a century of change meant to him, and I wonder what it would mean to havean even greater amount, maybe two centuries of change or even more, to reconcilewithin a single lifetime. The good news is that the same science that makeslongevity and immortality possible has also come full circle with the knowledgeto reconcile what such change means in our lives.EMBRACING BIG CHANGE IN A HEALTHY WAYPerhaps it’s no accident that the components driving change in our worldtoday—such as the technology and the discoveries that led to the development ofimmortal cells and to recognizing the power of heart-brain coherence—have alladvanced at the pace that they have. As the discoveries emerge in the sameperiod of time, it becomes clear that each needs what the others offer in orderto be useful in our lives.In Chapter 3 [chapter03.xhtml] I described the discovery of the conversationbetween the heart and the brain (coherence) and the many benefits that areavailable to us as we optimize this conversation. In addition to theextraordinary abilities of deep intuition, super learning, precognition, thetriggering of a powerful immune system, and the release of the life-affirmingenzyme telomerase that I mentioned, there is an additional benefit thatheart-brain communication makes possible as well. It’s called resilience, and itis nature’s way of helping us embrace big change in a healthy way.In recent years, scientists have discovered that by increasing our resilience tolife’s challenges, we actually reduce the stress that those challenges cancreate in our lives. In other words, as we strengthen the conditions within ourmind-body-emotion system, we shift the way we feel about our life challenges—ourperceptions—and do so in a healthy way. This is possible even though thecircumstances that are the source of the challenge may not have changed. It’sthis kind of resilience that will become the key to healing the emotional hurtsdescribed previously that we experience through extended life spans. The beautyof increasing our resilience in life is that we can do it at any age and at anytime in our lives.Key 38: Heart-brain resilience is the key to emotional healing from the loss offamily and loved ones that comes with extended life spans.A NEW RESILIENCEWhether we’re talking about one person or an entire planet of people, theconventional thinking when it comes to resilience is that it’s an inner qualitythat allows us to recover from a challenging event that’s happened in our lives,such as the loss of a loved one, job, or relationship. The AmericanPsychological Association defines this kind of resilience as “the process ofadapting well in the face of adversity” and “bouncing back from difficultexperiences.”19 [endnotes.xhtml#fn149] As well as this traditional definitionfits the conditions described on the evening news, and as much as the thinkingunderlying it makes sense, there’s another kind of resilience. It’s a new formof expanded resilience that’s seldom discussed, yet when we learn that itexists, it makes perfect sense.The Stockholm Resilience Centre describes resilience as the capacity to“continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds.”20[endnotes.xhtml#fn150] It’s the theme reflected in this second definition thatbest illustrates the kind of resilience we need in order to embrace the changesexperienced within an extended life span. We’re talking about a way of thinkingand living that gives us the flexibility to continuously change and adapt to newchallenges, new conditions, and new ways of thinking and living, rather thanhaving to bounce back from one loss after another. And it’s this form ofresilience that’s the key to healing unresolved stress. If we think of ourpersonal resilience as the combined force of the emotional, physical, andpsychological “batteries” that power us through life’s challenges, then expandedresilience is the juice that keeps our batteries continuously charged.It all begins with the resilience that we create within the heart itself. Oneway of determining our level of resilience is to measure the peaks and valleysof our heart rhythms.A DEEPER RESILIENCE FROM WITHINWhile most people are familiar with the graph of our heart rhythms that a doctorscrutinizes at our yearly medical exam, we may not be fully aware of everythingthe graph is showing. In addition to telling us information about the overallcondition of the heart, these rhythms can also tell us about the health of thenervous system. The graph the doctor is looking at is probably an ECG, orelectrocardiogram. The ECG measures the electrical output of the heart—theelectrical impulses that the heart creates and sends throughout the body.While the study and interpretation of heart rhythms could fill an entire book, Ijust want to focus on one thing about them here. There’s an aspect of the heartrhythm that’s the key to creating resilience. When looking at the peaks andvalleys of an ECG chart, even an untrained eye can clearly see that there arerepeating patterns of large spikes created by each heartbeat (see Figure 5.3).image [images/img-223-1.png]Figure 5.3. A portion of a typical ECG, showing the cyclic peaks and dips of atypical heartbeat. The distance from the peak of one R wave (R1) to the next(R2, R3, and so on) changes from beat to beat. It’s this heart rate variabilitythat gives us resilience in life. Source: Dreamstime © Z_i_b_i.What’s important to our discussion is that the distance from the top of onelarge spike (called an R wave) to the next is not always the same; it variesfrom beat to beat. While it may look like the space from one peak to the next isidentical, when we measure the intervals we find that the distances between themchange. And it’s a good thing they do, because this is where our resilience inlife begins.The greater the variability between beats, the greater the resilience we have infacing life stresses and changes in our world.21 [endnotes.xhtml#fn151] Becausewe’re measuring the variability between heartbeats, the measurement is calledjust what we’d expect: heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is measured in verysmall units of time called milliseconds, and the difference between oneheartbeat and the next may be a matter of only a fraction of a millisecond.As children we have a high HRV, and it makes perfect sense that we would. Whenwe’re young, and exploring and adapting to the world, our bodies need a way toadjust to what we find. And they need to adjust quickly. The first time ourfingers discover what hot water from the kitchen faucet is all about, forexample, or when we find out that not all dogs are as friendly as the one in ourliving room, we need to respond quickly. The heart’s capacity to alter itsrhythms—our HRV—and send blood to where it’s most needed is how we’rebiologically wired for the fast response that’s key to our survival.It’s the signal the heart sends to the brain that creates the coherencedescribed previously. Just to be clear, the heart and brain are always in somestate of coherence. In the chaos of daily life and the presence of negativeemotions, our coherence levels may be low. Through simple exercises such as theone described earlier in this chapter, “Discovering and Resolving YourUnresolved Stress” (see page 183), and the one below, we can shift keyparameters in our bodies to create higher levels of coherence. There’s a directconnection between the HRV in our bodies, our level of coherence, and theresilience we have when facing the extreme changes in our world today, or theextreme loss that would come with multicentury life spans. The connection isthis: The greater our level of coherence, the greater our HRV and our resiliencewill be.Key 39: More heart-brain harmony (coherence) leads to greater life resilience.Many of the recent discoveries regarding heart coherence, heart intelligence,and how to use both of them in our lives have been made by the scientists at theInstitute of HeartMath. Through peer-reviewed research, IHM has shown beyond anydoubt that two factors relate directly to personal resilience in our everydaylives: * Our emotions can be regulated to create coherence in our bodies. * We can use simple steps to create coherence on demand in our everyday lives.Working with some of the most prestigious organizations and innovativeresearchers in the world, IHM has developed a simple system known as AttitudeBreathing® that allows us to apply the discoveries they’ve made in theirlaboratories easily in our everyday lives. According to the researchers, themain benefit of this technique is that “the heart will automatically harmonizethe energy between the heart, mind, and body, increasing coherence andclarity.”22 [endnotes.xhtml#fn152] At IHM they’ve distilled the shift inemotions that creates the greatest levels of coherence into the following threesimple steps, which are adapted from Transforming Stress by Doc Childre andDeborah Rozman.23 [endnotes.xhtml#fn153]EXERCISEThree Steps to Personal Resilience: Attitude Breathing®Step 1. Recognize an unwanted attitude—a feeling or attitude that you want tochange. This could be anxiety, sadness, despair, depression, self-judgment,guilt, anger, overwhelm—anything that’s distressing.Step 2. Identify and breathe in a replacement attitude. Select a positiveattitude and then breathe the feeling of that new attitude in slowly andcasually through your heart area. Do this for a while to anchor the new feeling.Step 3. Tell yourself to take the “big deal” and drama out of the negativefeeling or attitude. Tell yourself: Take the significance out. Repeat this overand over as you use Attitude Breathing® until you feel a shift or a change.Remember that even when a negative attitude feels justified, the buildup ofemotional energy will block up your system. Have a genuine “I mean business”attitude and heart intent to really move those emotions into a more coherentstate.As you keep practicing, you will start to create new neural pathways and oldtrigger attitudes and resistances start to release.The best science of the modern world has revealed that we do, in fact, beginhealing the moment we are born. And our healing begins at the most fundamentallevel of our bodies, with the DNA itself. Now it’s up to us to embrace ourhealing and the very real possibility of multicentury lifetimes, or evenimmortality, if we choose.Regardless of how long we live in this world, however, the ability to self-healalso enables us to experience a quality of life that determines the success ofour relationships, jobs, and careers. It’s our ability to make these choices, ina way that no other form of life is capable of, that can make the differencebetween succumbing to the circumstances of fate and rising to our greatestdestiny.(Copyright © 2013 Institute of HeartMath)"},{"pageContent":"chapter seven [contents.xhtml#toc11]image [images/img-227-1.png]WE’RE “WIRED” FOR DESTINY [contents.xhtml#toc11]From Evolution by Chance to Transformation by Choice [contents.xhtml#toc11]“Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thingto be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.”— WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN (1860–1925), AMERICAN POLITICIANSometimes the best way to understand a complex idea is through the eyes ofsomeone who sees the world simply. The wisdom of Forrest Gump, the titlecharacter played by Tom Hanks in the 1994 film of the same name, is a perfectexample of this kind of vision. When Gump is asked about the role of destiny inour lives, his timeless words ring just as true today as when he spoke them onthe big screen for the first time, over two decades ago. “I don’t know if weeach have a destiny,” he says, “or if we’re all just floatin’ aroundaccidental-like on a breeze. But I think maybe it’s both.”1[endnotes.xhtml#fn154]Gump’s philosophy precisely describes what personal transformation is all about.As individuals we each have a destiny that awaits us as the fulfillment of ourgreatest potential. Our destiny is ours, however, only if we act. Through thechoices we make in each and every moment in our lives we claim this personaldestiny. The certainty of knowing who we are, and how we fit into the world, isthe compass that can guide us as we make our choices one day at a time.TWO PATHS TO UTOPIAA wave of bold novels written at the turn of the 20th century offered a glimpseof our collective future if the events of their day continued uninterrupted.Each book describes a time when humans have triumphed over the natural andtechnological problems that were common at the time of the writing. What setsthe books apart is the way the problems were solved.Arguably the best known of these books is Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World,published in 1932.2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn155] Huxley’s vision of the future is setin London in the year 2540, six centuries ahead of his own day. In that future,humankind has evolved beyond the limitations and suffering of the past. Huxleydescribes a world of peaceful co-existence where the population is limited tothe number of people that Earth can comfortably sustain, where war is a thing ofthe past, where everyone is happy and has everything they need, where eachperson is educated, and where disease no longer exists and everyone remainsperfectly healthy up until the last day of their lives. But the future that hedescribes comes at a very high price. To achieve the bliss of Huxley’s utopia,the very qualities of human life that we most value and cherish dearly havebecome casualties of the solution.The optimized population, for example, has been made possible because naturalhuman reproduction has been abolished. In the brave new world, human embryos arecreated and incubated in controlled facilities. They are selectivelyengineered—genetically designed—to reach specific IQ levels that qualify themfor specific jobs that are designed for them under the precision of a castesystem. Everyone performs the work that matches the aptitude they were designedwith, and they’re happy to do so because that’s all they know. They’re educatedonly to the level they need to be to do their job. Everyone receives exactly thesame pay, so there is no jealousy. People know from childhood when they willdie, because their lifetime is programmed to end at 60 years of age. But thereis no fear of dying, and no sadness when a friend or acquaintance dies, becausethe emotional bonding of partnerships and families that’s the source of suchpain has been abolished as well.Quiet and contemplative moments are discouraged, and people are encouraged tospend their leisure time in groups, enjoying activities and eating foods thatmake them feel good. And while recreational sex is encouraged, sex for thepurpose of love is obsolete. All of this unfolds under a global form ofgovernment that is led by 10 emotionally neutral leaders known as worldcontrollers.Huxley’s point in writing the book is to show that while it’s possible to solvethe problems that have plagued humankind since the beginning of time, the catchis to do so without drowning the very spark of individuality, creativity, andself-expression that makes us who we are and gives meaning to our lives.Huxley’s book was inspired by earlier literary works exploring our future, suchas H. G. Wells’s Men Like Gods, published in 1923.3 [endnotes.xhtml#fn156] WhileMen Like Gods was written nine years before Brave New World, the story takesplace in a world that’s 3,000 years into the future. Through a fluke of nature,the main character of the story, a London-based journalist named Mr. Barnstapleis transported in his automobile to a future Earth in the year 4923, when thereis no world government and religion and politics are only distant memories.They’re all part of a mysterious past, known as “the time of confusion.”In Wells’s future, the people of the world have embraced a form of education andgovernment based upon five principles of liberty: 1) privacy, 2) free movement,3) unlimited knowledge, 4) truthfulness, and 5) free discussion. Mr. Barnstaplefinds that this new world is so attractive that, not surprisingly, he wants tostay there for the rest of his life.The plot of the book takes a turn, however, as he learns that the best way hecan assure the future he’s discovered is to return to the familiar world that hecame from and share what he’s experienced. In doing so he plants the seeds andsets into motion the ideas that make such a future possible.PARALLELS TO TODAYI’m sharing details from both of these tales to contrast their visions of what’spossible for our civilization in the future. Both authors concocted worlds wherethe big problems of our day have been solved. In both visions, war has becomeobsolete. Both books describe a time when people are happy and healthy and havetranscended the extremes and perils that we face in our world today. The pointis that each book describes a very different path to achieve these outcomes: * One is at the expense of the values that give meaning to our lives and the expression of what it means to be human. * The other is through the cultivation of the very freedoms that make our creative expression possible.The parallels between these books and where we already find ourselves headed inthe contemporary world are unmistakable. We’re living in a time of extremes.We’re faced with choices that are not unlike those described at the turn of thelast century, choices regarding population; social, educational, and financialequality; and sustainable ways of living. The difference is that we’ve only justarrived at the crossroads that will determine what we want our lives to looklike and which type of future we will choose.Key 40: We still have the opportunity to create a healthy future by defining thevalues that we cherish before we implement solutions that cause irreversibleharm to us and to our planet.This is where the question of who we are comes in. Once we have answered thisquestion, I believe the values that will lead us to fulfill our greatest destinyare a natural outcome. Mastering the remarkable potentials of our bodies canempower us in ways that are highly beneficial to us as individuals andcollectively as a species, as well as to all life on earth. Expressing thesepotentials makes us resilient and gives us avenues through which to solve ourmost pressing challenges.Now that science has unlocked the secrets to some of nature’s most closelyguarded truths—such as quantum reality, the genetic code, and splitting theatom—knowing the secrets of our own capabilities is critically important. Forthe first time in recorded human history, our access to these secrets gives usthe power to chart our collective destiny, or to seal our collective fate and todo so in a single generation. This is exactly the situation that Aldous Huxleydescribed in Brave New World.It’s precisely because we’ve unlocked so many of nature’s secrets and become sopowerful over life on earth that we now must figure out how those secrets fitinto our lives and choose our course carefully. And while we may ask ourselvesthis question casually from a philosophical point of view, it’s been the serioustopic of passionate ethical debate in scientific circles for decades.WHAT GIVES US THE RIGHT?From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, I was privileged to work among teamsof brilliant earth scientists and aerospace engineers who were developing someof the most advanced technology the world has ever seen. For corporations anduniversities alike, this was a time of tremendous momentum, as America wasredefining its dependence upon foreign oil as well as developing futuristictechnologies during the ongoing Cold War and space program. Not surprisingly,this period of such intense research was accompanied by equally intenseintrospection. Scientists were exploring the limits of their newfoundcapabilities to alter life, the climate, and our planet at a level historicallyleft to God and nature. The degree of responsibility that comes with suchawesome power often sparked heated debates about our moral right to use suchtechnologies—debates that I enthusiastically joined at every opportunity.The discussions that erupted in front of office vending machines and laboratorydrinking fountains, and that often continued into restrooms and cafeterias,generally followed one of two schools of thought. One school believed that ourability to “tweak” the forces of nature was, in and of itself, license toexplore those technologies to their fullest. In other words, because we canmodify weather patterns and create new forms of life, we should do so, just tosee where the technology might lead us. A common justification for this thinkingwas, “If we weren’t meant to do such things, we would never have discovered thesecrets that made them possible.”The second school of thought was more conservative, suggesting that just becausewe have the ability to engineer life doesn’t mean we have the right to do so. Tosupporters of this approach, the forces of nature represented sacred laws thatshould not be tampered with. To customize the genetic code of our childrenbefore they’re born, for example, or to adjust global weather patterns to suitour needs is off limits, they argued. Tampering with nature, to them, wouldviolate an ancient, basic, unspoken trust.Although this “trust” is not necessarily spelled out word for word, this secondschool of thought would argue that if we cross the line from user to creator, weplace ourselves in forbidden territory, possibly with unintended consequences.Some scientists actually draw upon Huxley’s Brave New World to illustrate theslippery slope down which such a path could lead. The analogy often used was anautomobile’s speedometer. Just because the dial may indicate speeds up to 160miles per hour, this does not necessarily imply that we should drive ourvehicles that fast!It’s precisely the metaphor of a speedometer that I feel illustrates a third, asyet unidentified possibility. If a speedometer indicates that a vehicle iscapable of traveling at 160 miles per hour, in all likelihood someone willattempt to drive at this speed at some point in time. After all, it’s humannature to test limits, push boundaries, and carry our capabilities to theextreme. The key here is that when we do test our limits, we should have thewisdom to determine the time, place, and conditions of the test.We can find a deserted stretch of road, with a good surface, on a day when theweather is good, and minimize the possibility of injuring ourselves andothers—or we can act on an impulse and test the limits of a vehicle on a busyfreeway, endangering ourselves and risking the lives of those around us. Ineither scenario, the boundaries are tested. One is done responsibly, the othercarelessly.The same principle of responsibility must apply to the way we push the limits toengineer the forces of creation. We live in a world where we’ve entrustedscience and scientists to lead our journey of exploration, a journey from whichthere is little likelihood that we’ll ever turn back. The choices that we aremaking right now, with their assistance, regarding fossil fuels, climate,health, healing, and the global economy, impact each and every one of us on adaily basis. They impact our 401(k)s, IRAs, and retirement plans, and factorinto whether or not our children will be able to afford an education. Theyaffect the kinds of industries that will thrive and what jobs will be created inour communities. They determine the future of our health-care system and whetherour doctors will simply prescribe drugs when our poor lifestyle choices catch upwith us or help us create lives and lifestyles where we need fewer drugs.By honoring and basing our lives upon core values, we may ensure a future thatleads us to our greatest destiny rather than to mutual destruction. As we shiftfrom the old human story of separation, competition, and conflict to the newstory of connection, cooperation, and sharing, we find ourselves at a precipicewhere we must choose the values that we cherish most, both as a species and asindividuals in our everyday lives. We’re at a rare “sweet spot” between old andnew ways of thinking, where we can still choose the future we want and the pathto get us there. And it all comes down to what we think when we answer thequestion Who am I?THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE’S A LOT OF GOOD NEWS!There’s a lot of good news in the world. Though it’s often drowned out by thenoise of the media machine that spins our attention to the crisis of the day,the good news exists nonetheless. Examples include the already-existingsolutions for the personal and global issues that challenge our lives. So let’sbegin with the headline that should be appearing on the front page of everySunday paper: The simple truth is that our biggest problems are already solved!Key 41: We already have all of the solutions—all of the technologicalsolutions—to the biggest problems that we face as individuals, communities, andnations.Contrary to the thinking that we need to gather the scientists, engineers,spiritual teachers, and political leaders of the world together in one roomsomewhere to figure out how to create the best world and healthiest livespossible, the good news is that it’s already happened. We have already createdthe think tanks, brain trusts, and policy centers needed to achieve preciselysuch goals; we began doing so over a century ago. And these institutions havefound answers!From the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which was founded in 1910specifically to “hasten the abolition of international war, the foulest blotupon our civilization,”4 [endnotes.xhtml#fn157] to the Tellus Institute, foundedin Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976 “to advance the transition to a sustainable,equitable, and humane global civilization,” the framework is already in place toidentify options for developing a globalized world. The current focus of theTellus Institute’s research, for example, is to use advanced scientifictechniques to identify possible scenarios for humankind’s future. This includesthe search to identify a future that’s sustainable and equitable and thepolicies, actions, and choices to get us there.The point I want to make here is that we’ve already done the work. We’veidentified the big solutions and we already know what’s possible when it comesto addressing problems such as food security, abundant energy, sustainableeconomies, and a health consciousness based upon self-healing. And it’s a goodthing we have these solutions now, because we certainly don’t want to wait untilthe moment they’re needed to begin the search to find them.Let’s take a high-level look at some of the solutions I’m talking about, so youhave a sense of what I mean here.We already have the food we need. We already have all the food we need to feedevery mouth of every child, woman, and man on the face of the earth today.According to the United Nations World Food Programme, barring an extreme andunforeseen event such as an asteroid colliding with the Earth or a globalnuclear war, “There is enough food in the world today for everyone to have thenourishment necessary for a healthy and productive life.”5[endnotes.xhtml#fn158] A lack of food is not the reason that there areapproximately 925 million hungry people in the world, amounting to “more thanthe combined populations of the United States, Canada, and the European Union.”6[endnotes.xhtml#fn159]What’s lacking is the thinking and the leadership that makes it a priority forthe food that we already have, to get to the places where it’s needed most. Tobe clear, I’m not suggesting that this needs to be American leadership, or thetop-down leadership of any single country, for that matter. What I am saying isthat it’s the acceptance of the status quo that makes the tragedy of starvationpossible in a world where food is abundant and the technology to get that foodwhere it’s needed exists.We already have the energy we need. We already have the technology to bringelectricity into the home of every family on the face of the earth—clean, green,sustainable energy that emits zero greenhouse gasses. And we’ve had thetechnology for over 60 years.When we talk about energy, the tendency is to base our discussions on our energyexperience of the past, one largely based upon the burning of fossil fuels:first coal and then oil and natural gas. Realistically these forms of energywill probably remain in the world’s energy equation for the foreseeable future.However, they don’t need to. We already have solutions that make the energysources of the past obsolete. And just as the world is changing faster than eventhe “experts” could imagine, the shift away from burning something like oil orcoal to drive a turbine is approaching quickly.Sources of energy fall into two main categories. * Conventional renewable energy. At the mention of renewable energy, the “big three” sources generally come to mind—solar, wind, and hydro—and, to a lesser extent, geothermal. Rather than thinking of any one of these sources as the single solution to the world’s energy needs, it makes sense to think of them locally, and consider what each local environment can offer and sustain. While centralized, powerful, and reliable energy sources may be good to run the hospitals, schools, high-rise office buildings, and apartments in some big cities, there are places where local sources can supply—and in some cases replace—large, centralized systems. America’s desert Southwest is a perfect example of what I mean. The Four Corners area of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah is well known for the long days of sunlight, and the quality of sunlight, that it receives nearly every day of the year. Albuquerque, the largest city in New Mexico, for example, experiences an average of 278 days per year of sunshine, and some of the smaller communities in the northern valleys of the state average 300 sunny days each year. In places like these, it makes perfect sense to use solar energy to supply homes, offices, and small businesses with the electricity they need during the daylight hours that they typically operate. In the same region, however, there are other supplemental forms of power generation that can also be tapped. In addition to the sunlight in Four Corners, its weather patterns provide conditions that make wind energy a viable alternative to fossil fuels, for example. * Unconventional but proven energy. During the super-secret Manhattan Project of the mid-20th century, the race was on in the United States to find the mineral that could run the nation’s nuclear reactors and produce plutonium by-products that could be made into weapons during the Cold War.7 [endnotes.xhtml#fn160] While most people are generally aware that this is the case, they’re also surprised to learn that another mineral was discovered during this research that had many of the qualities of uranium as a fuel source but lacked the harmful side effects and dangerous by-products. The element is thorium, which is number 90 on the periodic table. Thorium was bypassed as a fuel source largely because it cannot be made into weapons, as uranium is today. A thorium generator works on a principle that is the opposite of a conventional nuclear reactor. In a thorium generator, the warmer the liquid becomes, the slower the rate of nuclear reactions.8 [endnotes.xhtml#fn161] This means the stuff that’s producing the reaction is the same stuff that prevents any further reaction at high temperatures. This difference means that a Fukushima-like meltdown could never happen with a thorium generator. The physics make it impossible. Many people are surprised to learn that thorium energy has advanced beyond theory. It already exists. A number of thorium generators have already been built and are being used for research and commercial applications in countries that include India, Germany, China, and the United States. In the United States there have been two thorium generators: the Indian Point facility in New York State, which was operational between 1962 and 1980, and the Elk River facility in Minnesota, which was operational between 1963 and 1968.9 [endnotes.xhtml#fn162] While we need more research before thorium technology can meet the large-scale needs of the world, it holds the promise of a clean, abundant, and relatively safe alternative to tide us over while we search for the ultimate source of energy.The next generation of power will be based upon infinite or “free” energy. Theprinciples for such energy were discovered over a century ago and are the focusof people seeking next-generation alternatives to fossil fuels.ECONOMIES BASED UPON SHARING RATHER THAN SCARCITYThe advent of modern technology is changing traditional thinking when it comesto the role of business and services in the modern world. The historic model hasbeen that whatever product or resource is needed is owned by some party. Thatparty then makes their goods and services available at a cost that covers theirexpenses and provides them with a profit. The need for rules and regulations inthis model is obvious. The volume of regulations, and the opportunity to evadethose regulations and “game the system,” has made this kind of economyburdensome and ruthlessly competitive.A new model is emerging that addresses at least some of these issues. It’s basedupon what’s been called a peer-to-peer or a sharing-based economy. Asharing-based economy challenges the traditional ideas of ownership and relieson shared production by the same people that are using the service. In this waythe need for hurtful competition and hoarding of what’s valued no longer makessense.The noncorporate taxi services Uber and Lyft and the noncorporate hotelalternative Airbnb are examples of the new sharing economy. While the nuances ofhow these new models operate are still hotly debated, the bottom line is thatthey’ve emerged from the very people that are using them and have created awelcome source of income in difficult economic times. In 2013, for example, itis estimated over 3.5 billion dollars of revenue was generated by new businessesin the sharing economy.10 [endnotes.xhtml#fn163]THE SILENT CRISISWhen we see examples of solutions, such as in the preceding paragraphs, andrealize that we already have them, there’s a single question that commonly comesto mind. I hear this question from live audiences throughout the world. Thequestion is this: Where are these solutions today? The answer often surprises myaudiences. It’s about a crisis that’s seldom acknowledged, yet it creates thegreatest hurdle that we face in our lives.Our crisis is a silent one. It’s rarely identified in mainstream media. There’sno chapter in our college textbooks that describes its power and the huge rolethat it plays in our lives. Yet it remains an invisible wall between us andevery one of the good news solutions that we could be benefiting from today.Our silent crisis is a crisis of thinking. We have yet to shift the thinking inour lives to make room for the solutions in our world. When we consider this, itmakes perfect sense. How can we embrace the new ideas and new solutions in ourlives if we’re clinging to the old ideas and solutions of the past? Put anotherway, how can we make room for the new world in our minds and in our hearts ifwe’re filled up with the images, emotions, and expectations of the familiarworld of the past?Key 42: The greatest crisis we face as individuals and as a society is a crisisof thinking. How can we make room for the new world that’s emerging if we areclinging to the old world of the past?It’s precisely for these reasons that the way we think of ourselves, includingour origins, is now front and center in the decisions we’re making when it comesto our everyday lives and our future. How do we implement the solutions thatalready exist, and do so in a way that honors the values that we cherish asindividuals, families, societies, and nations? So far, the science of the modernworld is leading us in the wrong direction.DANGEROUS CONCLUSIONSIn October 1988, renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking summed up thetraditional scientific view of how we fit into the big picture of the universe.In the German weekly publication Der Spiegel, he was quoted as saying, “We arejust an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. Butwe can understand the universe. That makes us something very special.”11[endnotes.xhtml#fn164]I remember my reaction when I first read these words from a man that I’ve alwaysrespected and held in high esteem. After all, Hawking was the man who wrote the1988 blockbuster book A Brief History of Time that brought the complex ideas ofcosmology and time travel into the living rooms of everyday families and madethe idea of a black hole part of our vocabulary. While my sense is that Hawkingwanted to convey that we are “special,” he did so coming from the perspective ofthe science that tells us we’re not. My reaction to his statement regarding usas “just an advanced breed of monkeys” was immediate. Speak for yourself,Stephen Hawking! I thought. Maybe that’s your story, but it certainly isn’tmine!WHEN SCIENCE GETS IT WRONGIn my opinion, Hawking’s statement regarding us as “an advanced breed ofmonkeys” is irresponsible. It’s not based in fact. And I believe it’s dangerous.It’s a perfect example of how modern science has tried to remove the humannessfrom our human story. In sharing his words, Hawking is telling us somethingabout himself personally, and revealing his own worldview. Either 1) he isuninformed and not aware of the latest fossil and genetic discoveries that makehis statement false, or 2) he is informed and aware of them, and he’s chosen toignore the facts.And if Hawking has chosen to ignore the facts, I can only speculate as to why hewould make such a choice. Maybe it’s to preserve the status quo when it comes tothe story of human evolution. Or maybe it’s something more personal. Maybe it’seasier to make sense of the extremes in our world, and what happens in ourlives, if we think of ourselves as “advanced monkeys.” If we don’t acknowledgethe facts of our origins, the extraordinary abilities that are inherent in ourexistence, and that we are biologically wired to regulate our extraordinaryabilities, then we remain the powerless victims of our biology. We are left toaccept that whatever happens to us is somehow nature’s will and beyond ourcontrol, rather than accepting responsibility for the world and our lives as wefind them.As extreme as Hawking may sound in his statement, however, he’s not alone in histhinking. Other established scientists have taken a similar view when it comesto human evolution, and some in such a ferocious way that it leaves me wonderingwhy they would continue to defend an obviously obsolete view soenthusiastically.FALSE BELIEFS AND DANGEROUS CONCLUSIONSBiologist and evolutionist Richard Dawkins is a very public example of what Imean here. Dawkins goes a step further than Hawking when he states, “It’sabsolutely safe to say that if you meet someone who claims not to believe inevolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane.”12 [endnotes.xhtml#fn165]While Dawkins isn’t clear as to whether this statement is directed toward thetheory of evolution in general or human evolution specifically, in either casethese are dangerous words that represent a dangerous thinking—especially comingfrom a prominent scientist and university professor with such a visible presenceon the world stage.The reason Dawkins’s words are so dangerous is that they chastise people forexpressing curiosity and denounce the very essence of the act of scientificexploration. In his statement, Dawkins goes beyond professionally criticizinganyone who doesn’t agree with him and evolution theory to publicly demeaning andeven questioning the sanity of someone who feels the current scientific paradigmisn’t convincing enough to buy into. I believe the thinking that Dawkins andothers of his kind promote is dangerous for another reason as well, which has todo with how their reasoning leads us to think of other people and ourselves.KILLING OUR UNIQUENESSAmong the extremes that we face in our lives today are the highly chargedenvironments of human hatred. It’s difficult to talk about. It’s hard to believehow deeply into our lives it reaches. And yet it’s there. Hatred is real. Andit’s a part of everyday life. Much of the hate in the world stems from the fearsthat we have of one another. Whether it’s based in reality or our perception ofreality, fear of the unfamiliar is at the foundation of the hate that we see inour schools, in our workplaces, and on the streets of even the most beautifulcities in the world.In such a volatile environment, the very diversity that biologists tell us hasalways been our strength in the past—things like race, religion, and culture—hasnow been hijacked and cleverly packaged into talk show sound bites and sharedYouTube video clips sold to the public as the wedge issues that separate anddivide us. These divisions happen to different degrees and at different levelswithin different societies.As a testament to the power of skillful marketing, the effort to polarize usthrough our differences has seen a surprising degree of success. A large portionof the general public has bought into them. For example, a recent surveyconducted for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed a marked decline inthe way both white and black people in America view race relations. The studyfound that, “according to the poll, 45 percent of whites and 58 percent ofAfrican-Americans now believe race relations are very or fairly bad, comparedwith 2009, when only 20 percent of whites and 30 percent of blacks held anunfavorable view.”13 [endnotes.xhtml#fn166]Clearly when it comes to factors such as religion and race, the meaning we giveto those qualities is tearing us apart at the core of our families, workplaces,schools, and communities. And while this kind of division may be new to themillennial generation (young people born late in the 20th century), recenthistory shows that this is not the first time this kind of division hashappened.A NEW NAME FOR KILLING WHAT IS FEAREDHistorians describe the 20th century as the single bloodiest century in all ofrecorded history.14 [endnotes.xhtml#fn167] In World War II alone, for instance,approximately 50 million people died in combat and from war-relatedatrocities.15 [endnotes.xhtml#fn168] And the deaths due to human atrocitiescontinued even after the war was over, through the end of the century. By 1999,80 million men, women, and children of all ages had been lost in the 20thcentury to violence based on ethnic, religious, and philosophical conflicts—fivetimes as many as were lost due to all of the natural disasters and the AIDSepidemic combined during the same period.16 [endnotes.xhtml#fn169]I’m sharing these horrendous statistics because they are part of a thinking thatled to an increase of a new kind of atrocity in the last century. While acts ofatrocity had certainly happened in the past, they reached such a magnitude inthe 20th century that they had to be given an official name so they could bedefined and made illegal.In 1948, the United Nations adopted the term genocide to describe this kind ofkilling, as well as to make it possible to clearly define and outlaw mass murderin global policies. The act of genocide was defined as “an intent to destroy”societies or the populations of entire geographic regions based upon ideas ofrace, religious beliefs, or bloodlines.17 [endnotes.xhtml#fn170] The thinkingthat is used to justify genocide and make it possible is a poignant example ofwhere false science can lead.WE’VE SEEN THIS BEFOREThe thinking underlying contemporary genocides, and specifically spelled out insome, is directly linked to Darwin’s false assumptions and how his ideas havebeen accepted, embraced, and perpetuated by modern science, even when they areproven false. California State University history professor Richard Weikart sumsthis up when he writes:Darwinism undermined traditional morality and the value of human life. Then,evolutionary progress became the new moral imperative. This aided the advance ofeugenics [the belief that selective breeding, and the elimination of “misfits,”can create an ideal human race], which was overtly founded on Darwinianprinciples. . . . Some prominent Darwinists argued that human racial competitionand war is part of the Darwinian struggle for existence.18[endnotes.xhtml#fn171]This thinking is mirrored in the ideas of philosophical works such as theinfamous Little Red Book, officially titled Quotations from Chairman MaoTse-Tung,19 [endnotes.xhtml#fn172] and Mein Kampf, the book that detailed AdolfHitler’s worldview. 20 [endnotes.xhtml#fn173] Both were used as justificationfor the brutal killings that took a combined toll of at least 40 million peoplein the genocides of the mid-20th century.Sadly, divisive thinking hasn’t disappeared with the passing of time. Since1945, genocides have continued in places such Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, andSudan. These are well-documented tragedies that tell us the thinking thatjustifies mass killing is still present today.21 [endnotes.xhtml#fn174] And anydoubt that we’ve somehow evolved beyond the thinking at the root of genocidequickly disappears with the well-documented tragedies of ISIS and the21st-century genocides occurring in Africa and the Middle East.In Origin of Species, Darwin clearly states his belief that the “weeding out” ofthe weakest members of the species he observed in nature applies to humans aswell:It may not be a logical deduction but to my imagination it is far moresatisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting itsfoster-brothers, [or] ants making slaves . . . as small consequences of onegeneral law leading to the advancement of all organic beings—namely multiply,vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.22 [endnotes.xhtml#fn175]In Mein Kampf, Hitler clearly paraphrased this idea:In the struggle for daily bread all those who are weak and sickly or lessdetermined succumb, while the struggle of the males for the female grants theright of opportunity to propagate only to the healthiest. And struggle is alwaysa means for improving a species’ health and power of resistance and, therefore,a cause of higher development.23 [endnotes.xhtml#fn176]Later in life, Darwin had second thoughts with respect to some of his earlierstatements regarding “survival of the strongest” in Origin of Species. Contraryto his early conclusions regarding superior individual strength, his later worksdescribed survival strategies in nature based on unity and cooperation, ratherthan natural selection and survival of the strongest. In his next major book,The Descent of Man, he summarized his observations: “Those communities whichincluded the greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish bestand rear the greatest number of offspring.”24 [endnotes.xhtml#fn177]Although Darwin may have seen the light in regard to his false assumptions ofcompetition and struggle, it might have been too late. Origin of Species wasalready a classic text as the foundation of a mind-set that today is used tosteer us away from reliance upon our natural instincts of cooperation andgoodness.NATURE’S RULE: COOPERATIONEarly in the 20th century, Russian naturalist Peter Kropotkin reinforcedDarwin’s later work with his own observations. Just as Darwin had observed theeffects of evolution firsthand among species of birds during his voyage ofdiscovery in the 1830s, Kropotkin made his own observations during scientificexpeditions to one of the harshest environments in the world: northern Siberia.He described how he’d found that cooperation and unity, rather than survival ofthe strongest, are the keys to the success of a species. In his classic bookMutual Aid, published in 1902, Kropotkin illustrated the benefits experienced inthe insect kingdom through the instinctual ability of ants to live ascooperative rather than competitive societies:Their wonderful nests, their buildings, superior in relative size to those ofman; their paved roads and overground vaulted galleries; their spacious hallsand granaries; their corn-fields, harvesting and “malting” of grain; theirrational methods of nursing their eggs and larvae, and of building special nestsfor rearing the aphides whom Linnaeus so picturesquely described as “the cows ofthe ants”; and, finally, their courage, pluck, and superior intelligence—allthese are the natural outcome of the mutual aid which they practise at everystage of their busy and laborious lives.25 [endnotes.xhtml#fn178]John Swomley, professor emeritus of social ethics at the St. Paul School ofTheology in Kansas City, Missouri, leaves little doubt that it is to ouradvantage to find peaceful and cooperative ways to build the global societies ofour future. Citing the evidence presented by Kropotkin and others, Swomleystates that the case for cooperation rather than competition rests on more thanjust its benefit to a successful society. In a simple and straightforwardfashion, he explains that cooperation is the “key factor in evolution and insurvival.”26 [endnotes.xhtml#fn179] In a paper published in February 2000,Swomley quotes Kropotkin, who states that competition within or between species“is always injurious to the species. Better conditions are created by theelimination of competition by means of mutual aid and mutual support.”27[endnotes.xhtml#fn180]In the opening address at the 1993 Symposium on the Humanistic Aspects ofRegional Development held in Birobidzhan, Russia, co-chair Ronald Logan offereda context for the participants to view nature as a model for successfulsocieties. He directly quotes Kropotkin, who states:If we ask Nature: “Who are the fittest: those who are continually at war witheach other, or those who support one another?” we at once see that those animalswhich acquire habits of mutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest. They have morechances to survive, and they attain, in their respective classes, the highestdevelopment of intelligence and bodily organization.28 [endnotes.xhtml#fn181]At a later point in the same address, Logan cites the work of Alfie Kohn, authorof No Contest, describing in no uncertain terms what his research had revealedregarding a beneficial amount of competition in groups. After reviewing morethan 400 studies documenting cooperation and competition, Kohn reports hisconclusion: “The ideal amount of competition . . . in any environment, theclassroom, the workplace, the family, the playing field, is none. . . .[Competition] is always destructive.”29 [endnotes.xhtml#fn182]A growing body of ancient, scholarly, and scientific evidence suggests that inthe absence of conditions that drive us to be animal-like in our actions (suchas a Mad Max scenario, where there is a total breakdown of society, commerce,and medical care), when we’re given the opportunity, we prefer to live peacefuland compassionate lives that honor the benevolent aspects of our species.In other words, when the conditions we value in life are met—that is, when wefeel safe, when we feel that our families are safe, and when we feel that ourway of life is safe—we allow our truest nature to shine through in everything wedo.How can we know with certainty when these conditions have been met? PulitzerPrize–winning poet Carl Sandburg answered this question in nine brief words:“Sometime they’ll give a war and nobody will come.”30 [endnotes.xhtml#fn183]Key 43: A growing body of scientific evidence is leading to an inescapableconclusion: Violent competition and war directly contradict our deepestinstincts for cooperation and nurturing.As long as the diversity of our languages, religions, sexual orientations, andskin colors are falsely portrayed as flaws to be feared, people will turnagainst other people whose lives and beliefs differ from their own. They willshun, criticize, attack, and even try to destroy those whose ideals and beliefsthey don’t recognize in themselves. This is the common thread that connects eachof the examples shared above. Each atrocity illustrates a lack of value forhuman life.In a culture where life is valued and respected, none of the atrocitiesdescribed here—or any of the countless additional ones that literally fillvolumes in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the UnitedNations—could ever happen.KILLING WHAT’S DIFFERENTThe fact that race-based, gender-based, and religion-based atrocities pittinghuman against human have continued into the early years of the 21st centurytells us that while we may have condemned the unthinkable acts of genocide wesaw in the 20th century, we have yet to heal the thinking that makes these actspossible. Whether it happens at the level of nations, as genocide, or on a locallevel, as in the bullying in our schools or the resurgence of hate crimes in theUnited States in recent years, the fact that atrocities such as these exist atall is an indication that this way of thinking appears to be gaining momentumrather than becoming a thing of the past.The following examples offer a brief glimpse of what I mean here. They representonly a sampling of an unsettling trend that’s gaining strength in the worldtoday.Please note: This section was difficult for me, emotionally, to research and towrite. My effort to reduce the countless numbers of victims under each categoryof hate crime to a single representative example in no way diminishes thesuffering of the victims not mentioned or the pain that their families continueto experience. Due to the brutal nature of each example, I’ve chosen tosummarize what transpired only from a high level of generality to 1) illustratethe thinking that underlies each example and 2) support my statement that thiskind of thinking still exists today. Especially sensitive readers may want toskip ahead to the section titled “The Common Thread.”Cyber-based violence. While peer-to-peer harassment, shaming, and violence haveprobably existed as long as groups of young people have been confined togetherin classrooms of one kind or another, the degree of this kind of violenceappears to be on the rise. There are different kinds of bullying that range fromdirect physical contact, such as hitting and spitting, to verbal attacks with nophysical contact at all. Through the use of e-mail, Face-book, Twitter, andother online social networks, a new form of bullying appears to be on the rise:cyberbullying. Due to the growing use of social media among young people,cyberbullying is now documented to be very widespread.According to the National Center for Education Statistics, since 2007 nearlyone-third of all students ages 12 to 18 have been bullied while they were inschool. A 2014 study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education reported,“During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported thatbullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis.”31[endnotes.xhtml#fn184] The statistics show that all forms of bullying, includingcyberbullying, are dangerous. They all have painful consequences, some that canlast well into adulthood, and some that are so painful that they lead studentsto take actions that are irreversible, such as suicide or murder.On January 14, 2013, a distraught 15-year-old student named Jadin Bell walkedonto the campus of an elementary school and hanged himself on the outdoor junglegym. Jadin was a member of the high school cheerleading team and the victim ofwhat was characterized as “intense” bullying through social media, largelybecause of his sexual orientation. His attempted suicide was unsuccessful atfirst, however, and he didn’t die immediately. Instead, Jadin was foundunconscious but alive and rushed to the nearest hospital, where he remained in acoma and on life support until he died on February 3, 21 days later.32[endnotes.xhtml#fn185]Jadin’s suicide made national headlines and helped catapult the phenomenon ofcyberbullying into the national conversation. His death powerfully illustrateshow nonphysical bullying can have devastating emotional effects. According toJadin’s father, his son was “hurting so bad. Just from the bullying at school.Yeah, there were other issues, but ultimately it was all due to the bullying,for not being accepted for being gay.”33 [endnotes.xhtml#fn186]Sadly, Jadin’s suicide is not an isolated incident. A growing number of youngteenagers feel that taking their lives is the only way to cope with thehumiliation that comes from cyberbullying. The nature of the bullying studentsendure ranges from insults about their appearance, weight, or physical features,and sharing of nude pictures that were originally taken in confidence to younggirls being filmed during assaults and then being humiliated a second time asthe videos are shared publicly on social media.34 [endnotes.xhtml#fn187]Violence based on sexual orientation. Statistics compiled by the Federal Bureauof Investigation, the U.S. Census Bureau, the Pew Research Center, the WilliamsInstitute, and demographic mapping website SocialExplorer.com[http://SocialExplorer.com] were used to compare the number of hate crimesoccurring in the United States targeting LGBT, Jewish, Muslim, black, Asian, andwhite people between 2005 and 2014. The result of the nine-year-long study wasclear. As summarized in The New York Times, the study found that LGBT people“are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans, and the rate of hatecrimes against them has surpassed that of crimes against Jews.”35[endnotes.xhtml#fn188] The savage killing of a young man in rural Wyomingprovides a powerful example of the brutality that can stem from extreme thinkingabout sexual orientation, and that led to the later study.Matthew Shepard was studying political science at the University of Wyoming in1998. A gay man, he was enjoying an evening out at a local lounge on October 6of that year with two other men who pretended to befriend him. At the end of theevening, they offered to give him a ride home and he accepted. But instead ofbeing taken home, he was driven to a remote area where he was severely beaten,lost consciousness, and was left for dead. He was still alive, however, and in acoma, when a police officer discovered him at the remote location eighteen hourslater. Doctors determined that the injuries to Matthew’s brainstem were sosevere that they could not safely operate on him. He remained on life supportuntil he was pronounced dead on October 12, 1998.36 [endnotes.xhtml#fn189]The high visibility of Matthew’s story and of the trial of the men who werefound guilty of his murder was due, in large part, to the antigay motivation oftheir actions.Violence based on race. In June 1998, a man who had been hitchhiking one eveningnear his own town in rural Texas accepted a ride offered by three men, one ofwhom he was acquainted with. The hitchhiker, James Byrd, Jr., was black, and themen who picked him up in their car that evening were white. At least two of thethree white men were self-described white supremacists. The events that followedand led to James’s death were so brutal that they had to be censored by thenational media in the public interest. It was this event, however, along withthe hate killing of Matthew Shepard the same year, that led to the passage of afederal law named the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate CrimesPrevention Act, which expanded the 1969 United States federal hate crimes law toinclude crimes motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived gender, sexualorientation, gender identity, or disability. The act was passed by the U.S.Congress on October 22, 2009, and signed into federal law by President Obama onOctober 28 the same year.37 [endnotes.xhtml#fn190]Violence based on religion. In testimony presented at the British House ofCommons in 2016, one of the British ministers read verbatim portions of aninterview with Ekhlas, a 15-year-old girl living in northern Iraq, who, alongwith her family, followed the ancient Yazidi religion. Ekhlas’s village wasoverrun by ISIS soldiers, she was captured and enslaved until she escaped fromher captors. 38 [endnotes.xhtml#fn191] She described how these men had come toher family’s home, killed her father and two brothers, and then brutalized herand every girl in her village over the age of nine. The reason for their ordeal,she said, was their religion. “We were targeted because our religion and beliefis different from theirs, and our humanity is different from theirs, because webelieve in the angel Taus.”39 [endnotes.xhtml#fn192]Religion-based hate crimes are not limited to the Middle East. They are making aresurgence in other parts of the world as well, including Europe and the UnitedStates. Since 1996 the FBI has logged statistics for violence against people inthe United States based upon their religious beliefs. The 2014 Hate CrimeStatistics report states that 5,479 incidents of hate crime in general werereported in 2014. Of this number the percentage that were religion-based crimesagainst individuals was 17.1 percent.40 [endnotes.xhtml#fn193]Interestingly this is very close to the percentage for crimes based upon sexualorientation (18.7 percent).The study also shows that of the offenses reported, “Approximately 58.2 percentwere anti-Jewish, 16.3 percent were anti-Islamic, and 6.1 percent wereanti-Catholic.”41 [endnotes.xhtml#fn194]THE COMMON THREADThere is a common thread that weaves its way through the examples of hate crimesI’ve just described. In following that thread, we’re given insight into the kindof thinking that’s tearing at the very fabric of our families, communities, andsocieties. In each instance, the brutality of the hate crime could happen onlyin the presence of a belief that the life of the victim had no worth.Key 44: The brutality of hate-based crimes is possible only in a society wherethe value of human life has been lost.Hate crimes are about something that goes much deeper than the taking of anotherperson’s life. They are rage-filled demonstrations of overkill—murders basedupon an almost primal fear of the unfamiliar, combined with a belief that humanlife is common and expendable. And while the previous examples are extremes ofwhere such thinking can lead when it’s expressed outwardly toward other people,hate can be directed inward as well, demonstrating an extreme of a differentkind.Inward-directed abuse is sweeping through our schools and touching the lives ofour sons and daughters, siblings, friends, mothers, and fathers. And it’saffecting our young people in epidemic proportions. While it’s happening in away that’s more subtle than the violent hate crimes I’ve described, the outcomeis the same. The self-inflicted abuse of prescription drugs and alcohol oftenleads to the devastating loss of the people that we love the most.The pain of losing a loved one to their inwardly expressed hatred is almostbeyond expression. That pain is especially acute when a surviving family memberstruggles with unanswered questions and the feeling that if only they’d donesomething differently, their loved one would still be alive. Tara Lawley-Bergey,the older sister of Derik Lawley, describes this pain in an essay she wroteafter Derik’s death due to a lethal dose of the drug fentanyl to satisfy hisheroin addiction.TARA’S STORYIn an essay that was published by the Philadelphia affiliate of NBC in Februaryof 2016, Tara describes how her brother had suffered from a heroin addiction fortwo and a half years.42 [endnotes.xhtml#fn195] She reveals that she never reallyknew why Derik began to experiment with heroin. But she speculates about whatmay have happened. Tara says her brother loved life. He loved those around him,especially his three-year-old daughter. But he didn’t love himself. “Heroinhelped Derik escape his reality; it put him into a daze that allowed him toforget,” she writes.43 [endnotes.xhtml#fn196] And although he attempted to weanhimself from his addiction at least five times, his efforts were unsuccessful.Derik’s body was found abandoned in a wooded alley a full day after he had beendeceptively given fentanyl, a narcotic associated with anesthesia, when hebelieved he was receiving a familiar dose of heroin to satisfy his addiction. Hedied from the effects of the drug, which put him into such a deep sleep that itsuppressed his breathing. Tara’s pain in reflecting on her brother’s experienceis best described in her own words:My heart died the moment Derik took his last breath. His body lies in ashes asmine dies slowly from within. The darkness lingers and the nightmares loom intothe light. The pain of losing Derik is unbearable, and I am living in the ninthcircle of hell, my treachery being called an addict’s sister. Siblings love eachother regardless of their paths; they guide each other when they have fallen andare each other’s shoulder to lean on. But I distanced myself from Derik’saddiction; it made him a wicked man. I should have been there for Derik, to wipethe sweat of addiction off his brow when the wickedness came upon him time andtime again. Or in the least, I should have called, wrote, or sent Derik love ina care package. But I ignored him, gave him the cold shoulder, and did not seethe real person within his eyes. I practiced tough love when I should have justshown him compassion. That is my burden, my guilt, my pain to bear all the daysof my life.44 [endnotes.xhtml#fn197]The tragic story of Derik is a powerful testimony to a preventable death. It’salso a story that unfortunately is not a rare one. Time and again, differentparents from different communities, different races, and different religions askthe same question through their tears as they bury their sons and daughters. Thequestion is why. “Why did this happen to my child?” And as different as theirfamilies are from one another, the answer to their question is the same. A man,woman, or teenager who values himself and finds a sense of worth in his lifewould never pump heroin into his veins, snort cocaine into the delicate tissuesthat breathe life into his body, or flood her liver and kidneys with so muchalcohol that she loses consciousness.Key 45: The destruction of an individual through the abuse of drugs and alcoholis only possible when the personal sense of worth is lost.WE ONLY DESTROY WHAT WE DON’T VALUEEnvironmentalist and author Rachel Carson summed up the thinking that leads tosuch heartbreaking and devastating experiences for families throughout the worldwhen she said that we destroy what we don’t value and that we can’t value whatwe don’t know.45 [endnotes.xhtml#fn198] Carson’s observation beautifullydescribes the theme of this book and the crux of what we’re up against today.And while experts attribute the uptick in person-to-person violence toeverything from inequality between those who “have” and those who “have not” toreligious intolerance among Christians, Jews, and Muslims, the real reason thatlies at the core of all reasons for the increasing violence toward one anotheris the source of a difficult truth.While we’ve created a wondrous society and a culture of advanced technology,we’ve done so at a tremendous cost. Somewhere along the way we lost the valuethat we place on a human life. And without that sense of value, life seemsexpendable. The treatment of textile laborers at the turn of the 20th century isa perfect example. Only days after dozens of textile laborers died in New YorkCity’s Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, worker and union activist RoseSchneiderman gave a speech describing how human life is undervalued:This is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every weekI must learn of the untimely death of one of my sister workers. Every yearthousands of us are maimed. The life of men and women is so cheap and propertyis so sacred. There are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of usare burned to death.46 [endnotes.xhtml#fn199]Although Schneiderman made this speech over a century ago, the conditions thatshe described and the thinking that makes those conditions possible haven’tchanged all that much. We need look no farther than everyday headlinesthroughout the world to see how deeply the sense that life is “cheap” continuesto play out in our daily existence. * Between 2001 and 2012, the number of women in America killed by their former or current partners was 11,766, over twice the total number of American troops killed in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined, during the same period of time.47 [endnotes.xhtml#fn200] * In 2013, disregard for safe conditions in a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, led to the collapse of the building and the death of over 1,000 people, making it the worst disaster of its kind in history.48 [endnotes.xhtml#fn201]Key 46: Rachel Carson reminds us that we only destroy what we don’t value and wecan’t value what we don’t know. A lasting solution to the issues that divide usand the growing levels of bullying, hate crimes, and wartime atrocities is toinstill in the new generation, and embrace within ourselves, the need to respectand value all life.THE POWER OF SELF-WORTHIn our hypercharged environment of extremes, what we believe about who we areand where we come from holds a special place of sacred power. It’s preciselythese beliefs that hold the power to fragment our communities and polarize ournations so we engage in endless wars. Such beliefs also have the power to unifyus. The deepest truth of our origins could give us a reverent sense of value foreach and every human life.This is why it’s so dangerous to believe false science and lie to ourselvesabout where we come from. If it were true that we’re “just an advanced breed ofmonkeys” and “ignorant, stupid, or insane” for believing anything other than theaccepted doctrine of human evolution, then it would make perfect sense to liveour lives in a way that reflects such a belief. In that world the pursuit ofmaterial wealth, the diversions of the mind, and the pleasuring of the sensesbecome the highest priorities of life. In such a world, it would make sense todo whatever it takes to satisfy ourselves at any cost, in any way we can. Whynot? After all, if we’re simply the lucky outcome of nature’s lottery of randommutations, why wouldn’t we? Why wouldn’t we swallow whatever chemical or tonicis available to numb us to the hurts of life? Why wouldn’t we infuse our bodieswith whatever manufactured drug or brain-altering substance is available toescape the insanity of war, the injustice of poverty, and the horrors ofphysical and emotional abuse? And why wouldn’t we destroy anything or anyonethat stands between us and getting what we need to live such a life?Here’s what I’m getting at: As long as we’re led to believe that we’re littlemore than an accident of nature, it will be easy to feel that there’s nothingexceptional about us or our lives. From this sterile-sounding perspective, ourstory is simple, direct, and void of any deep meaning. We’re born. We live. Andwe die. We’re blips of life on nature’s radar screen, just as billions ofcreatures have been before us.The irresponsible words of renowned, high-profile scientists and public figuresonly make things worse for us by throwing fuel onto the fire of our differencesand sense of insignificance.FROM BAND-AIDS TO DESTINYThe potential to shift from merely identifying and condemning the atrocitiesthat stem from a lack of self-worth and intolerance of our differences toembracing a destiny where such atrocities are only a memory of the past becomespossible when we consider the positive impact of our answer to Who are we? Thisanswer, based upon the facts we now know to be true about ourselves, andparticularly about the specialness of our existence, is the key to our new humanstory of life with a purpose.In a culture where we embraced life’s specialness, people wouldn’t criticize,hurt, and kill one another or themselves with the ease and frequency that we seetoday. To do so would make no sense in light of what we know about our originsand what it means in our lives.By embracing our specialness and the value of life at the foundational level ofour selves and families, and by basing the education that we give our childrenon these uniquely human values, we could create the foundational shift—acomplete sea change for people everywhere around the world—that leads to ourgreatest destiny of realized potential as a species. To do anything less is theequivalent of merely placing a Band-Aid on the open wound that’s destroying ourfamilies, communities, and societies. In a culture where these values wereembraced, Derik Lawley would have never succumbed to the temptation of takingheroin that cost him his life, James Byrd, Jr., and Matthew Shepard would bealive today, and the genocides of the 20th and early 21st centuries would neverhave happened.On an individual level, in a culture that truly values life, this means that: * A man who embraces the specialness of another life would never unleash his rage on a woman carrying his unborn child, on his existing children, or on anyone else he loves. * The delicate balance that gives us our specialness would be honored. Men, women, and children would never poison their bodies with the alcohol and drugs that destroy the fragile systems that make their lives possible. * Teenagers would never pull the trigger of a gun on a friend or themselves because life has placed them in what feels like an overwhelming situation. * Someone driving a car would never pull out a gun and turn it on another driver for suddenly changing lanes in front of them to make a freeway exit.On a larger scale, this means that: * A soldier or rebel fighter who values the specialness of life would never brutalize another man or the man’s wife and children simply because they don’t share the same religious beliefs as him. * A nation that embraces, shares, and teaches its children to respect and value life would never march onto the land of another nation to destroy its people’s sources of water, food, and electricity or its schools and hospitals.The way we think of ourselves and one another is at the very core of thegreatest fears and the greatest suffering that we experience in our lives today.While we can pass legislation to punish, send armies to coerce, and denouncehuman atrocities once they’ve happened, these are temporary fixes for conditionsthat can only change with a foundational shift in thinking—specifically in theway we think about ourselves, our origins, and the value we place on life onearth. And this foundational shift is what’s lacking in the education that weoffer our young people today.Albert Schweitzer, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952, taught how vital itis for us to embrace a reverence for all life. “Only by means of reverence forlife,” he says, “can we establish a spiritual and humane relationship withpeople and all living creatures within our reach.”49 [endnotes.xhtml#fn202] Thereverence that Schweitzer talks about here goes beyond simply respecting lifeand includes our ability—our duty—to protect and defend all forms of life inneed. “Only in this fashion [of reverence] can we avoid harming others,”Schweitzer says, “and, within the limits of our capacity, go to their aidwhenever they need us.”50 [endnotes.xhtml#fn203]We have an opportunity at this very moment in history—the “sweet spot” of choicedescribed previously in this chapter—when we’re determining the balance betweenwhat science and technology have made possible and how we implement thosepossibilities in our lives. It’s the difference between Aldous Huxley’s future,in which human creativity, individual expression, reproduction, and life itselfare compromised for the sake of creating a homogenous and peaceful world, andthe future described by H. G. Wells, in which humankind achieves a harmoniousway of living and does so as the result of honoring and cultivating the valuesthat we cherish. Whether we’re talking about personal decisions related tohealth care, jobs, relationships, and careers, or more global issues, such asthe need to find new sources of clean and sustainable energy and address therealities of poverty, social change, and the growing numbers of refugees createdby oppression and war in the world, as complex as such issues appear at firstblush, they all come down to the way we think about ourselves. For each of theseissues, and a host of others, we’re being challenged to identify the values thatwe cherish as humans and to claim those values as the guiding principle of ourdecisions. Once we recognize this, it’s clear that only by embracing the worthof every person, and the value of each and every life, can we choose the destinythat holds our greatest potential.Anglican bishop Desmond Tutu summed up this idea perfectly in a reminder thatit’s by sharing that which makes us unique—our capacity for love andcompassion—that we discover our value. “Your ordinary acts of love and hope,” hesays, “point to the extraordinary promise that every human life is ofinestimable value.”51 [endnotes.xhtml#fn204]So where do we start when it comes to creating a world that cherishes humanlife? Where do we even begin?The first step is to embrace what we’ve discovered as the new human story."},{"pageContent":"chapter eight [contents.xhtml#toc12]image [images/img-263-1.png]WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? [contents.xhtml#toc12]Living the New Human Story [contents.xhtml#toc12]“One’s destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.”— HENRY VALENTINE MILLER (1891–1980), AMERICAN WRITERThe traditional answer to Who are we? is crumbling. It has to. The reason isthat it’s based upon information we now know isn’t true. The key discoveriesthat are overturning the way we have thought of ourselves for 150 years are onlythe beginning of identifying a new human story. Once you’ve seen thediscoveries, you cannot “un-see” them. You know they exist. They’re already partof you. So you have to ask, “What now? How does this information fit into mylife and what I want for myself, my family and friends, and the earth?” Findinganswers to these questions begins with how closely you embrace what you’vediscovered.Ultimately, what you do next comes down to a choice. It’s your choice. What doyou accept and what does it mean in your life?When I’m faced with new and life-changing information, such as I have been whenconfronted by the evidence for a different scientific explanation of humanorigins than Darwin’s original theory of evolution, there are three simplequestions I ask myself to guide my choices.Guidelines That Can Help You Make a Choice 1. Do I recognize that I have a choice? 2. Do I have the courage to choose? 3. Do I have the strength to follow through on the choice I’ve made?When it comes to the very personal question Who am I? here’s how the guidelinescould be applied: 1. Do I recognize that I have a choice between believing the old story of human evolution and the new evidence that tells us evolution isn’t our story? 2. Do I have the courage to choose to believe what the new science is telling us and to accept and embrace the new discoveries? 3. Do I have the strength to follow through and live what such a choice means when it comes to what I teach my children and the way I treat other people?In any situation, your answer to these three simple questions can transform theway you think of your life and see yourself, and perhaps more importantly, itcan change your actions. By developing the discipline to ask these questionsbefore taking action, you automatically expand the number of options that areavailable to you. From the choices you make regarding diet and nutrition,honesty in relationships, and selecting health-care options to simply being moreopen to new possibilities for jobs, careers, and personal creativity, thesesimple guidelines will help you make your choices in a conscious and mindfulway. You may be surprised to discover just how powerful you are when it comes toshaping what your life looks like today and creating a fulfilling tomorrow.My reason for writing this book has been to share the new discoveries that givenew meaning to the way we think of ourselves, and one another. But my reason forsharing this information goes beyond just wanting you to know the facts. Thescientific evidence of our intentional origin through an as-yet-unknownintelligent external force gives new meaning to our existence. It carries usbeyond survival of the strongest, struggle, and competition. It opens the doorto a possibility that we may be related to something much greater than we’vebeen led to believe in the past—and that we may have a cosmic history, a cosmicfamily, and a cosmic origin.As a scientist, this idea sounds like the plot of a great science-fictionthriller at first blush. But it’s where that thriller can lead that excites me.It’s the possibility where we transform our lives and our world in the best waypossible, and do so while honoring the human values we cherish most. In somerespects this is the outcome described in H. G. Wells’s book Men LikeGods—except that if we succeed, it will be happening 3,000 years earlier.RETHINKING YOUR BASELINE BELIEFSNow that you’ve had the benefit of reading this book and the discoveries it hasrevealed, I invite you to round out your reading experience by revisiting thequestions I asked you at the beginning of Part I.Before Chapter 1 [chapter01.xhtml], I invited you to create a baseline for whatyou thought about evolution and its significance for your life and of what youbelieved about yourself. Now is a good time to reexamine those thoughts andbeliefs to clarify if—and how—they have changed.Opening the door to our greatest potential as human beings must begin with ourwillingness to embrace the fact that the potential for extraordinary thingsexists. After you’ve answered the following questions, I invite you to compareyour answers to those you recorded at the beginning of this book. My overarchingquestion to you is: Has what you’ve discovered transformed the way you think ofyourself, your limits, and most importantly, your potential?EXERCISEReassessing Your Baseline BeliefsThe Technique. Using single words or brief phrases, please write down youranswers to the following questions as honestly as you can. For yes-or-noquestions, circle your answer. * Questions about Your Origins. 1. Do you believe that the origin of life in general is the result of a chance event that happened long ago, as conventional science suggests? YesNo 2. Do you believe that human life—your life—is the result of a chance event that happened long ago, as evolutionary theory suggests? YesNo * Questions about Your Potential. 3. Do you believe that you’re designed to consciously influence the events of your life, the quality of your life, and how long you live? YesNo If you answered no to the previous question, continue to “Defining Your Beliefs” below. If you answered yes to the previous question, please continue here: 4. Do you trust your ability to trigger self-healing in your body on demand when you need it? YesNo 5. Do you trust your ability to trigger your deepest states of intuition on demand when you need them? YesNo 6. Do you trust your ability to self-regulate your immune system, your longevity hormones, and your overall health? YesNo * Defining Your Beliefs. 1. When I notice something unusual happening with my body (sudden aches or pains, an unexplained rash, a rapid heartbeat for no apparent reason, and so on) I now find myself feeling _____________________________. 2. When I notice something out of the ordinary happening with my body, the first thing I will do is __________________________.The way you’ve answered each of these questions will guide you to understand howyou currently think of your potential. These answers can also serve as a compassthat indicates in what direction you may want to explore your personal growth.The key here is that your body can respond only to the fuel of the beliefs youembrace.For example: * If you believe that life in general, as well as your life in particular, is the result of a chance event that happened a long time ago, then this perception may be reflected in the choices you make in other areas of your life. For example, it’s easier to discount the sacredness of life and the value of our experiences when we tell ourselves that we’re the result of a lucky accident of biology that just “happened” to have occurred long ago. To embrace the growing body of evidence suggesting that we’re the result of an intentional act—when we really get that we’re here on purpose—we’re left with a sense of awe and a deep appreciation for all life, everywhere. That appreciation is reflected in the way we think of ourselves, as well as the way we treat our friends, family, and loved ones. * If you don’t trust your body’s ability to maintain your health, heal, and strengthen your immunity, or your capacity for intuition, then this perception may show up in how you respond to changes in your body. Do you become fearful at the first sign of something new or different in your body? When do you choose to see a doctor to interpret the signs that your body is showing you?To be absolutely clear, there are no right or wrong answers to any of thesequestions. Your answers may be deep and personal reflections of the way you wereconditioned to think of yourself. If that thinking has served you in the pastand it continues to work for you today, then you are now consciously aware ofthe beliefs that guide you. But if you now find that you’d like to expand yourrelationship with your body, then your growth must begin with the beliefs thatare the foundation of that relationship.Perhaps it’s no surprise that the more we know about ourselves—and the deeper weexpand our awareness of our bodies’ potential—the more purpose we sense to ourlives. And I believe that’s ultimately the goal for each of us: to discover andembrace our purpose while we’re experiencing life’s possibilities.LIFE WITH A PURPOSEAlmost universally, the indigenous traditions of the world remind us that we’rethe products of a conscious and intentional act of creation and somehow part ofa cosmic family, and that as we grow and mature in our understanding, our trueheritage will come to have greater meaning in our daily lives. In ancientwritings, varying from Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics to thecarvings and pictograms discovered in the Mayan jungles of Central America, andin the spoken wisdom of Native North Americans and South Americans, ourancestors have told us that we’re part of something vast and beautiful. Asdescribed in the scriptures of the world’s most ancient traditions, we’re givenextraordinary abilities—godlike traits—that set us apart from all other forms oflife and empower us to have connected, vital, and meaningful lives. We’rereminded, as well, that we are stewards in this world, here to protect all life,and not masters born to dominate life.It’s through our extraordinary powers of intuition, empathy, and compassion thatwe are granted the privilege to be the earth’s caretakers—an ability given to noother form of life. One of the greatest visionaries in history, Chief Seattle, aleader of the Suquamish people of the American Pacific Northwest, reminds us ofour role in clear, eloquent, and direct terms. While the source of the followingstatement, often attributed to Chief Seattle, remains unconfirmed, the sentimentthat it carries is timeless:Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it.Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together.All things connect.1 [endnotes.xhtml#fn205]The best science of the modern world seems to support the essence of thiswisdom. Our extended neural networks and our ability to use our hearts, brains,and nervous systems to enhance our lives on demand are now scientificallydocumented. While there are scientists who may not share the self-empoweringinterpretations of the scientific findings that are offered in this book, whatwe can say with certainty is that there is nothing in the new discoveries thatcan deny that these capabilities exist in us or that would prevent thesecapabilities from being the result of an intentional design in the human genome.While we may not fully understand where our advanced abilities come from, theevidence shows that our extraordinary intellect and our capacity for compassion,empathy, and deep intuition are no accident. They’ve been with us, as original“equipment,” from our beginning. They are inherent in our nature and appear tohave a purpose—they are a vital part of an intentional design.THE REAL WORKThe world is on the move and our lives are moving with it. Now that you knowwhat’s in these pages, you cannot unknow what you’ve read. You can’t simplyclose the book and forget about these discoveries regarding your origin or theimmense power that lies within you. Although you’ve reached the end of thisbook, you’ve also reached the beginning of what comes next. This is where thereal work begins. When you close this book, you’ll be faced with a choice todiscount what you’ve discovered about yourself or to embrace it.Either choice takes effort. Either choice takes real work.In his timeless book The Prophet, philosopher Kahlil Gibran makes a statementabout the meaning of “work” that I remember reading when I was 10 years old. Asa young boy living in a fatherless home with my single mother and youngerbrother in low-income, government-subsidized housing, Gibran’s words provided away of thinking that guided me then and has stayed with me as the cornerstone ofmy life’s philosophy ever since. Gibran reminds us that work “is our love madevisible.”2 [endnotes.xhtml#fn206] To me, this has always meant that the effortthat goes into any task is about more than the task itself.If I’ve agreed to do something, then it’s the meaning I give to whatever thatsomething is that matters to me. My “love made visible” means I am 100 percentpresent and I give 100 percent of myself to whatever it is that I’ve said yes todoing. In other words it’s not about what we do, it’s about the way we do it. Ittakes work to be fully present, and from Gibran’s point of view, that work is anexpression of our love for the world, ourselves, and our families.I’m a realist when it comes to the work it will take to embrace our new humanstory. It will take work to change the textbooks, computer files, teachers’class notes, and scientific displays in museums throughout the world. It willtake work to teach the new human story to our children and then to theirs. It’sthrough our work, our love made visible, that we chart our greatest humanpotential: the choice to move from evolution by chance to transformation bychoice. The question now is, do we believe we’re worth it?Do we believe we’re worth the work it will take to embrace the extraordinarypotential that lies waiting within each and every human being? We won’t need towait long to know how we’ve answered. We’ll know by the world we choose to leavefor our children.THE NEW HUMAN STORY IN 46 KEYSThroughout this book, I have introduced the discoveries and facts that give us areason to think differently about ourselves. To emphasize what I felt werelandmarks within the book, I highlighted significant ideas and discoveries. Butwhat may not have been obvious is that while each of these keys by itselfsummarizes an important theme, when the keys are read together, one afteranother, they tell a story. This story is the essence of the new human story.For your convenience, you can read the keys one after another below.Key 1: In the presence of the greatest technological advancements of the modernworld, science still cannot answer the most fundamental question of ourexistence: Who are we?Key 2: Everything from our self-esteem to our self-worth, our sense ofconfidence, our well-being, and our sense of safety, as well as the way we seethe world and other people, stems from our answer to the question Who are we?Key 3: By allowing new discoveries to lead to the new stories they tell, ratherthan forcing them into a predetermined framework of ideas, we may, at last,answer the most important questions of our existence.Key 4: New DNA evidence suggests that we’re the result of an intentional act ofcreation that has imbued us with extraordinary abilities of intuition,compassion, empathy, love, and self-healing.Key 5: The stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves—and believe—define ourlives.Key 6: When we change the story, we change our lives.Key 7: For the first time in recorded human history, Charles Darwin’s theory ofevolution, published in 1859, allowed science to answer the big questions oflife and our origin without the need for religion.Key 8: While the connections between ancient primates and modern humans on theevolutionary family tree are believed to exist, they have never been proven asfact—they are inferred and speculative connections only, at this point in time.Key 9: The discovery of an extraordinarily well-preserved female Neanderthalinfant—dating back 30,000 years—and the comparison of her mitochondrial DNA toours, tells us definitively that the earliest modern humans were not thedescendants of ancient Neanderthals.Key 10: Human chromosome 2, the second-largest chromosome in the human body, isthe result of an ancient DNA fusion that cannot be explained by the theory ofevolution as we understand it today.Key 11: The 20 proteins that make the clotting of blood possible and the 40-pluscomponents of the cilia (wiggly tails) that allow cells to move through a fluidare just two examples of functions that could not develop gradually over a longperiod of time as evolution suggests. In both examples, if even one protein orcomponent part is missing, the function of the cells is lost.Key 12: Humans appeared on earth with the same advanced brains and nervoussystems we have today, and with the ability to self-regulate vital functionsalready developed, contradicting the corollary to evolution theory that naturedoesn’t “over-endow” with such features until they are needed.Key 13: A growing body of physical and DNA evidence suggests that our speciesmay have appeared 200,000 years ago with no evolutionary path leading to ourappearance.Key 14: An honest scientist, who is not bound by the constraints of academia,politics, or religion, can no longer discount the new evidence about our humanorigins and still remain credible.Key 15: As part of our advanced nervous system, the heart partners with thebrain as a master organ to inform the brain of what the body needs in any givenmoment.Key 16: Ancient traditions have always held that the heart, rather than thebrain, is the center of deep wisdom, emotion, and memory, as well as serving asa portal to other realms of existence.Key 17: The discovery of 40,000 sensory neurites in the human heart opens thedoor to vast new possibilities that parallel those that have been accuratelydescribed in the scriptures of some of our most ancient and cherished spiritualtraditions.Key 18: Scientific documentation of memories carried from a donor into the bodyof a recipient through the heart itself—memory transference—demonstrates justhow real the heart’s memory is.Key 19: The heart is the key to awakening deep intuition, subtle memories, andextraordinary abilities thought to be rare in the past, and to embracing theseattitudes as a normal part of everyday life.Key 20: Willingness to embrace a scientific assumption as fact, in the absenceof evidence to support it, can lead us, and has led us in the past, to wrongconclusions when it comes to the way we think of ourselves and our relationshipto the world.Key 21: Renowned scientists tell us that it is mathematically impossible for thegenetic code of life to have emerged through the process of evolution alone.Key 22: Almost universally, ancient and indigenous traditions attribute ourorigins to the result of a conscious and intentional act.Key 23: A growing body of evidence suggests that we exist as part of a livingand vibrant universe rather than one simply made of inert dust, gas, and emptyspace.Key 24: If we’re the result of something more than pure chance, then it makessense that our lives are about more than purely surviving. It implies that ourlives have purpose.Key 25: Our capacity for deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, compassion, and theself-healing that allows us to live long enough to share these capacities, arethe needle of a compass that points us directly to our life purpose.Key 26: Intuition is a real-time assessment that draws upon personal and pastexperience, sensory cues, and “street smarts,” while instinct is a response thatis “hardwired” into our subconscious as a survival mechanism.Key 27: The emotional bond that exists between a mother and her children is nowscientifically documented through studies that offer insights into the intuitiveconnection that we all can develop in our relationships.Key 28: Intentional heart focus empowers us to consistently experience deepstates of intuition when we choose, on demand.Key 29: We can access our heart’s wisdom through a process that can besummarized in five simple steps: focus, breathe, feel, ask, and listen.Key 30: Intuition, sympathy, and empathy are the steppingstones to compassion.Key 31: Compassion is both a force of nature and an emotional experience thatconnects us with nature and all life.Key 32: Telomeres are specialized sequences of DNA located at the ends of achromosome that serve as a buffer to protect the chromosome’s geneticinformation when a cell divides. With each cell division, the telomeres becomeshorter, until they can no longer protect the vital information of the cell, atwhich point the cell experiences old age, senescence, and eventually death.Key 33: The purpose of the telomerase enzyme in our cells is to repair,rejuvenate, and lengthen the telomeres that determine how long our cells live.Key 34: Our choices of lifestyle, including specific forms of exercise, specificdietary supplements, and reducing stress in the body, are key strategiesdocumented to successfully slow and even reverse telomere damage and cellularaging.Key 35: It’s the unresolved stress in our lives that erodes our telomeres andsteals from us the very thing we cherish most: life itself.Key 36: Through our heart’s wisdom we can ask for and receive insights intohealthy alternatives to the unhealthy diversions in our life.Key 37: In each moment of every day, we make the choices that affirm—ordeny—life in our bodies.Key 38: Heart-brain resilience is the key to emotional healing from the loss offamily and loved ones that comes with extended life spans.Key 39: More heart-brain harmony (coherence) leads to greater life resilience.Key 40: We still have the opportunity to create a healthy future by defining thevalues that we cherish before we implement solutions that cause irreversibleharm to us and to our planet.Key 41: We already have all of the solutions—all of the technologicalsolutions—to the biggest problems that we face as individuals, communities, andnations.Key 42: The greatest crisis we face as individuals and as a society is a crisisof thinking. How can we make room for the new world that’s emerging if we areclinging to the old world of the past?Key 43: A growing body of scientific evidence is leading to an inescapableconclusion: Violent competition and war directly contradict our deepestinstincts for cooperation and nurturing.Key 44: The brutality of hate-based crimes is possible only in a society wherethe value of human life has been lost.Key 45: The destruction of an individual through the abuse of drugs and alcoholis only possible when the personal sense of worth is lost.Key 46: Rachel Carson reminds us that we only destroy what we don’t value and wecan’t value what we don’t know. A lasting solution to the issues that divide usand the growing levels of bullying, hate crimes, and wartime atrocities is toinstill in the new generation, and embrace within ourselves, the need to respectand value all life."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES [contents.xhtml#toc13]image [images/img-279-1.png]Heart Intelligence / ResilienceThe Institute of HeartMath, www.HeartMath.org [http://www.HeartMath.org]“The Institute of HeartMath is an internationally recognized non-profit researchand education organization dedicated to helping people reduce stress, selfregulate emotions and build energy and resilience for happy, healthy lives.HeartMath tools, technology and training teach people to rely upon theintelligence of their hearts in concert with their minds at home, school, workand play.”Hate CrimesNational Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA), www.trynova.org[http://www.trynova.org]Hate crimes create a complex set of circumstances and needs that vary fromindividual to individual.

The Popol Vuh, as weknow it today, is taken from the records of Francisco Ximénez, a Dominicanpriest, written at the turn of the 18th century. The manuscript sank intoobscurity until it was “rediscovered” in 1941 by Adrián Recinos, who isgenerally given credit for publishing it in recent times. Recinos explains: “Theoriginal manuscript is not divided into parts or chapters; the text runs withoutinterruption from the beginning until the end. In this translation I havefollowed the Brasseur de Bourbourg division into four parts, and each part intochapters, because the arrangement seems logical and conforms to the meaning andsubject matter of the work. Since the version of the French Abbe is the bestknown, this will facilitate the work of those readers who may wish to make acomparative study of the various translations of the Popol Vuh” (Goetz xiv;Recinos 11–12; Brasseur, xv).4.

Part 2: The letter tellsus which of the two arms that make up a chromosome the gene is on: the short (orp) arm, or the long (or q) arm. Part 3: The latter number tells us the gene’sactual position on the chromosome, as determined by the number of dark and lightbands that are visible using a microscope on specially stained samples.

While somescientists continue to object to the conclusion that human chromosome 2 is theresult of an ancient gene fusion, the evidence clearly points to such a fusion.To summarize, the evidence states that: (1) the fact that the DNA sequences ofthe separate chimp genes are nearly identical to those found combined in humanchromosome 2; (2) the presence of a second unused “vestigial” centromere (thepoint that separates the long and short arms of the gene), which would beexpected if two genes, each with one centromere, had merged into a single unit;and (3) the presence of vestigial telomeres—the protective sequence of DNAnormally found at the ends of chromosomes— found midgene in the q13 band, ratherthan at the end of the chromosome.18.

I was returning home following three days of presentations ata conference in London. As I made my way past the television monitors along theairport concourse I noticed a common theme that wove each separate broadcastinto the shared story that was washing across the airwaves that evening.From the tragedies of domestic violence in the United States and the growingtrend of cyberbullying among young people to the epidemic of illegal drug usethroughout America and the unspeakable atrocities occurring in war-torn Syriaand Iraq, the theme at the core of each news broadcast was the same: It was ahuman story based in the lack of value for human life. It was clear to me thatany solution to ease such tragedy and suffering must address that core—thefundamental way that we think of ourselves, and one another. In that moment thisbook was conceived. I wanted to create a concise and accessible source of newdiscoveries that give us the reasons to change the way we think of ourselves.But a book is only an idea until it is given form.If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community of like-mindedindividuals with diverse skills, spread across many time zones, to birth a bookinto being. This section is my opportunity to express my gratitude andappreciation to the family that has supported my commitment to share our newhuman story—the copy editors, proof editors, page layout designers, graphicdesigners, marketing representatives, publicists, and event producers who haveworked behind the scenes to make this book possible. To each and every one ofthe most dedicated Hay House family I could ever imagine working with, I’mespecially grateful to:Louise Hay, Reid Tracy, and Margarete Nielsen—Thank you for your trust in me,your vision of how we as authors can contribute to our communities, and yourdedication to the truly extraordinary way of doing business that has become thehallmark of Hay House’s success.Patty Gift—I’m so deeply grateful to you for believing in me from the beginning,for your ever-present support, your trust, and especially your friendship.

Thank you for your dedication to helping me reach as many peopleas possible with our empowering message and for making it so much fun to do so.Christy Salinas and Tricia Breidenthal—You, and your extraordinarily talentedstaff, have been so patient with me, so open to my ideas, and so right on whenit comes to the most beautiful book covers I could ever imagine that “thank you”seems inadequate to express the depth of my gratitude to you.Kathryn Wells—Our awesome web project manager extraordinaire.
