The questionshows up in different, and at times unexpected, ways in our lives. Sometimes weask it consciously and find ourselves actually whispering the words under ourbreath. Most of the time, however, we don’t. For most of us the question lingersin the back of our mind as a nagging sense of something unfinished andincomplete in our lives. Regardless of how we ask the question itself, however,the intention it comes from is the same. It’s simply this:“How do I make life better for myself and my family?”The answer to this question is precisely what this revised-edition book,Resilience from the Heart, is all about.The first version of this book was published in January 2014. I celebrated therelease, originally titled The Turning Point: Creating Resilience in a Time ofExtremes, with an international tour of keynote presentations, daylong seminars,and weekend workshops to take the information directly to people and communitiesI felt would benefit most from the message of resilience. In the U.S. and thecountries that had translated the book into their respective languages, I hadthe opportunity to witness in live audiences something that I could never seefrom the statistics of a book sales spreadsheet alone. From my vantage point oninternational stages, I could look into the eyes of my audiences to seefirsthand how people experienced the ideas I was sharing.For example, when I acknowledged that a “new normal” is replacing the familiarworld of our past—an uncharted territory of extremes ranging from social changeand climate change to the uncertainty of jobs, finances, careers, and the stressthese changes bring to our lives—the sea of nodding heads told me that I wasconnecting with my audience. And each time I stated that we must firstacknowledge and mourn the passing of the world that’s disappearing in order tothrive in the new normal, the collective whispers of agreement let me know howhealing it is for us to acknowledge the new normal, openly and honestly.But the body language of the room showed me other things as well, some that wereless comfortable for me to acknowledge. I learned quickly, for example, when theaudience became stretched to connect with what I was sharing. And perhaps mostimportant, I learned from their body language when they couldn’t connect withthe information at all. From moments of dead silence, broken by sporadic throatclearing and the shifting of chairs, to people exiting for an early bathroombreak, it was obvious when I had crossed beyond the comfort zone of acceptedideas. The point here is that from the evening of the first program inCopenhagen, Denmark, to the end of the international tour, a clear patternemerged when it came to the information that was most meaningful and mostuseful. That pattern was predictable, and it remained so throughout the tour.Without exception, the material that my audiences were most drawn to was theactual experience of creating resilience in their bodies as well as theirlives—the techniques and exercises that helped them embrace change in a healthyway. When I returned to the U.S., the pattern continued. It was universal andnot linked with culture or lifestyle. And although The Turning Point did sharemany of the techniques for resilience that I was describing in the programs, Ihad placed them in later chapters of the book, thinking that they’d mean morewithin a larger context.My audiences, however, showed me something different. They didn’t want to waituntil the end of the seminars to have the “how-to” experiences. Clearly, theywanted to know the strategies and experience the techniques that lead tohealthier lives quickly, and they wanted me to share them as soon as possible.I’m a good listener. I’ve learned to attend to my audiences and the feedbackthey share with me.This retitled, rearranged, and repurposed edition of the original book is myresponse to so many heartfelt requests for precisely these perspectives.Resilience from the Heart is designed to get to the techniques and applicationsquickly, within the first three chapters. The chapters that follow from thatpoint offer an honest, truthful, and factual description of why the resiliencewe learn is so necessary and how to apply in our lives the techniques that welearn in the book.The best science of the 21st century now echoes the spirit of our most ancientand cherished spiritual traditions. Both reveal that the key to resiliencebegins in our heart. Whether you’re facing health issues yourself, helping lovedones through overwhelming life issues, managing impossible finances, or feelingoverwhelmed by the extremes of a volatile world, Resilience from the Heart iswritten with you in mind. Within these pages you’ll find everything you need toembrace the biggest challenges in life and do so in a healthy way. Please acceptthis book as my opportunity to say “thank you” for supporting this work and forinviting me, and my message, into your life.In Gratitude,Gregg Braden"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [contents.xhtml#toc_2]the power of resilience in a time of extremes [contents.xhtml#toc_2]img [images/rule.jpg]If you’ve ever been on a journey of any kind, then you know the routine. Toprepare for the trip, you first get an idea of where you’re going. You check theweather conditions, study maps, and then pack what’s needed to keep yourroutines alive while you’re traveling.The key here is that when you know where you’re going, you know what to takewith you. And when you find yourself going somewhere you’ve never been, youprepare for the unknown. It’s this simple idea that’s at the heart of this book.Our JourneyWe’re all on a journey, and it’s a big one. Our journey is leading us to a placeno one has ever been. There are no travel guides or Internet trip advisors totell us precisely what our destination looks like. There are no time-testedlists to tell us what we’ll need when we get there. Rather than planning atemporary excursion to an exotic place that we can return from after a few days,we hold one-way tickets. This is a different kind of journey altogether. We’renot just going to another location somewhere on Earth. We’re going to anotherworld hidden within our everyday lives—and it’s the choices we’re making todaythat are taking us there. Together we’re barreling down the fast lane of asuperhighway that’s crossing the boundaries of traditional beliefs, religions,and habits of the past. In doing so, we’re also blowing right past the limits ofwhat we thought was possible. These very experiences are our passports leadingus to the new world that’s emerging before our eyes.Our DestinationI can’t say for sure what our destination will look like. After the dust settlesand we learn to adapt to our changing climate rather than trying to control it,after new and sustainable economies replace those that are fractured and failingtoday, after we embrace the technology that provides every bit of the energy weneed without the devastating side effects of fossil fuels, I can only imaginewhat our lives and the world will be like. And when I do, I see a better placefor us all.I see a world where we’ve raised the standard of living for everyone, ratherthan lowering it for many in order to support only a few. I see a world wherethe differences in the color of our skin and the religion we believe in areobsolete and using the threat of war to solve our problems no longer makes anysense. I see a world where our love of cooperation is greater than the fear thatdrives us apart. And I see the shift in thinking that makes each of these thingspossible.To get to that shift, however, we must begin by recognizing the realities thatwe face and the promise that they hold. A good place to begin is byacknowledging the fact that we’re living in a time of extremes.A Time of ExtremesWe’re living in a time when we can expect big things to happen—big shifts in theworld and big changes in our lives. And just to be clear, the extremes I’mtalking about don’t necessarily have to be only bad things. And they don’t evenneed to be good things for that matter. It’s just that they’re big things. Andbig things are happening all around us in our lives as well as our world. WhileI’ll describe the reasons for the extremes in the upcoming chapters, the keyhere is that we’re living a rare era of transition.We’re living the emergence of a new “normal,” and the success of our transitionhinges upon (1) our willingness to acknowledge the shift, and (2) our ability toembrace it in a healthy way. Our globalized culture of jobs, money, markets, andresources means that it’s now impossible to separate the extremes in the worldfrom what they mean in our everyday lives.The crisis of climate change is a perfect example of this connection; therecord-setting droughts caused by shifts in global weather patterns translatedirectly into scarcity of seasonal crops and the higher prices we pay for foodat our local markets. The extreme debt and failing economies on the other sideof the planet translate directly into higher costs at the gas pump and higherticket prices for the buses, trains, and taxis that take us to work each day.Because of these and other extremes, bank loans have become less available, andthe interest we’re being paid on our savings, checking, and retirement accountshovers near an all-time record low zero percent. The global slowdown of industrytranslates directly into the loss of jobs and job security in our localcommunities.These are the kinds of extremes in the world that are creating big changes inour lives. Among the many uncertainties they bring, though, there’s one thingthat we can be sure of: our lives are changing in ways that we’re not used to,not prepared for, at a speed that we’ve never known.The KeyI’m an optimist by nature. I see real reasons for optimism in our lives. At thesame time I’m also a realist. I am under no illusions when it comes to the hugeamount of work that it takes to find our way into the new world that lies beforeus. Our ability to successfully meet the challenges that are converging in ourlives begins by our acknowledging what may be the most obvious yet difficultquestion we could ask of ourselves: How can we deal with the issues unless we’rewilling to acknowledge the issues?Our willingness to embrace this simple question is the key to developing moreresilience in our time of extremes.Everyone Is on the JourneyA big difference between trips that we may have taken in the past and the bigjourney that we’re on now is that today we don’t get to pick our travelingcompanions. The reason is simple: Everyone on the planet is part of our journey.No one can be left behind. Our world today is so deeply interconnected on somany levels that it’s impossible for the transformation that’s emerging in onepart not to show up in other places as well. I’ve seen this firsthand in mytravels to some of the most remote and isolated places remaining in theworld—like Tibet, for example.In 2005, following a number of previous pilgrimages to the monasteries of theTibetan Plateau, I saw for the first time the eerie glow of cell phonesilluminating the dark recesses of centuries-old buildings as they lit up underthe robes of the monks and nuns. For the people living in these secludedmonasteries, their former world based in isolation is now on a path of newlyfound connectivity. The new technology promises that their world, and theirlives, will never be same.A Crisis in ThinkingWe don’t need to go to Tibet, however, to see the evidence of how dramaticallythe world is shifting. Change is reflected everywhere, both in the ways in whichthings in our lives work, as well as in the ways things of the past no longerwork. The old era of an oil-based economy, for example, is giving way to a neweconomy based upon cleaner forms of energy that are more sustainable. The oldideas of centralized production of our food from corporate farms half a worldaway is giving way to the new, healthy, and sustainable production of food fromsmall farms that invigorate local economies. The old practice of creating wealthfrom industries that destroy our planet is giving way to new, sociallyresponsible models of investing.And as the world of the past slips away and the new one emerges, the clash ofnew against old highlights another, even greater crisis, one that we all face,yet which we’ll probably never read about or hear discussed in the popularmedia. It’s a silent crisis that’s like the proverbial elephant in theroom—something that everyone sees yet no one acknowledges.Arguably the greatest crisis that we face in our time of extremes is a crisis inthinking. And our thinking is the very key to the way we deal with our needs inthe new normal. You and I are being tasked with something that’s never beendone. We’re being challenged to radically shift the way we think of ourselvesand our relationship to one another and the world, and to do so faster than anygeneration in history has ever done before.Our willingness to think differently will be the key to the success of ourjourney. And while it’s definitely a big journey that we’re on, it’s also a veryshort trip, because the world we’re traveling to is already here. It’s with usright now.We Have the SolutionsFortunately for us, the technology to solve the biggest challenges we face hasalready been discovered. The biggest problems we could ever imagine are alreadysolved. The advanced principles are already understood. They all exist in thismoment, right here, right now, and are at our fingertips. All that standsbetween us and the new world—where energy is abundant and comes from cleansources accessible to every member of our global family; where clean, healthyfood is plentiful and accessible to every mouth on the planet; where every humanis able to obtain the basic necessities to live a comfortable, meaningfullife—is the thinking that makes room in our lives for what already exists in ourworld.The question that we must ask of ourselves, and now answer, is this: are wewilling to embrace the thinking that makes such possibilities a priority? Willwe allow the deepest truths of our relationship to ourselves, to one another,and the earth to become the passport for our journey?This book was created for you to help answer just such questions.The Big PictureAs you read the pages that follow, I invite you to keep five facts in mind:Fact 1: Now is different. From the breakdown of national economies and theglobal shift of energy dominance, to the realities of climate change and thefailure of war to solve our differences, a convergence of extreme conditionsunlike anything known in the history of the world is upon us. It’s because nowis different that the thinking of the past no longer works to solve ourproblems.Fact 2: Life gets better, and resilience is the key. It’s important to rememberthat the only things breaking down in our lives right now are ways of living andthinking that are no longer sustainable. Personal resilience makes room for bigshifts in our lives, and is our greatest ally in our time of extremes.Fact 3: A turning point of thriving transformation can replace the tipping pointof frightening extremes. Nature provides a time when every crisis can be turnedinto transformation, when simply surviving the extremes in the world can beturned into a thriving way of life. That time is a turning point. A turningpoint emerges when a new force—a fact, a discovery, an experience—changes theway we address our course of events. What matters is that turning points of lifemay be spontaneous, or they may be created.Fact 4: We already have new solutions. We already have the solutions necessaryto create turning points of transformation in our lives. We don’t need toreinvent the wheel. Rather, we need to build the “road” of thinking that givesthe “wheel” of solutions something to travel upon.Fact 5: The biggest crisis is the most difficult to accept. The single factorthat lies between crisis and transformation is one that has eluded scientists,politicians, and religious leaders alike. It’s a crisis in thinking. We mustembrace the thinking that allows us to accept the existing solutions into ourlives.It’s these five facts that cut to the very heart of what we’re up against andhold the keys to the next step of transformation, both for ourselves and for theworld. Our ability to thrive in the midst of such massive change—our personalresilience—is the first step to ensure the success of our journey.In This BookThroughout the chapters that follow, I invite you to share an honest and factualjourney of very real possibilities. This is not a honey-sweet depiction of lifeseen through rose-colored glasses of wishful thinking. Instead, this is anhonest assessment of the realities that have arrived at our doorstep andmeaningful strategies that can guide each of us in the choices that willtransform our lives.In the following pages, I’ll answer the two questions that seem to be oneveryone’s mind: What do global extremes mean in our personal lives, and how dowe make everyday life better for ourselves and our families? As you read, you’lldiscover: * Strategies for heart-based resilience to embrace change and loss in a healthy way * Tangible changes you can implement in your life right now to turn tipping points of change into turning points of transformation * The path to successfully adapting the way in which you think of your job and career, and your money and finances, in a transformed world * The facts defining this time of extremes overlooked in the mainstream media * The keys to elevating yourself—and all of us—to a higher standard of clean, healthy, and sustainable livingIt’s important that you know from the very beginning what you can expect fromthis book, why it was written, what it is, and what it is not. * Resilience from the Heart is not a science book. Although I will share the leading-edge science that invites us to rethink our relationship to the world and the way we’ve been conditioned to solve our problems, this work has not been written to conform to the format or standards of a classroom science textbook or a technical journal. * This is not a peer-reviewed research paper. Each chapter has not gone through the lengthy review process of a certified board or a selected panel of experts conditioned to see our world through the eyes of a single field of study, such as physics, mathematics, or psychology. * This book is well researched and well documented. It has been written in a reader-friendly way that incorporates case studies, historical records, and personal experiences that support an empowering way of seeing ourselves in the world. * This book is an example of what happens when we cross the traditional boundaries between science and spirituality. By marrying the discoveries of 20th-century biology, the earth sciences, and social change, we gain a powerful framework within which to place the dramatic shifts of our age and a context that helps us deal with those changes.When the Facts Are Clear, the Choices Become ObviousIn the past, we’ve all been led to think of ourselves, our nations, ourreligions, and our lives in ways that have that helped us make sense of ourworld—through stories based on what our families and communities accepted astrue at some given point in time. If we’re honest with ourselves and acknowledgethat the world is changing, then it makes sense that our stories must change aswell. I invite you to consider the facts in this book and then explore what theymean to you. Talk them over with the people in your life. In doing so, you’lldiscover for yourself if, and how, your story changes.Resilience from the Heart is written with one purpose in mind: to empower us inthe choices that lead to thriving lives in a new, transformed, and sustainableworld. I believe it’s possible to embrace this path while preserving thetraditions from our families and heritage that make our time in this world sorich.The key to our transformation is simply this: the better we know ourselves, thebetter equipped we are to make our choices wisely.— Gregg BradenSanta Fe, New Mexicoimg [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE [contents.xhtml#toc_3]THE UNCHARTED HEART: [contents.xhtml#toc_3]New Discoveries Reveal Even Deeper Mysteries [contents.xhtml#toc_3]img [images/common1.jpg]“If the 20th century has been the Century of the Brain . . . then the 21stcentury should be the Century of the Heart.”1 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en1]— GARY E. R. SCHWARTZ, PH.D., AND LINDA G. S. RUSSEK, PH.D., AUTHORS OF THELIVING ENERGY UNIVERSEWhat would it mean to discover that the purpose of the human heart—your heart—isabout more than simply pumping blood through your body?While our hearts obviously do pump the blood that nourishes our organs and eachof the 50 trillion or so cells that make up our bodies, recent discoveriessuggest that the purpose of the heart may reach far beyond the function of apump. The benefits of harmonizing our hearts with our brains to empower us withdeep intuition, precognition (knowledge of future events), and the direct wisdomof heart intelligence can immediately catapult us beyond traditional thinkingwhen it comes to the way we live and solve our problems. It’s thesecapabilities, as well, that provide the resilience to embrace big change in ourlives and to do so in a healthy way.The pages that follow only begin to scratch the surface of what awaits us as weexplore the miraculous-sounding capabilities now documented as normal—yet lessapparent—functions of the heart. What additional roles does our heart fulfillthat we’re only beginning to recognize? The more we discover, the deeper themystery becomes.We live in a world where things that would have seemed mysterious—evenimpossible—only a generation ago have become commonplace. Within a singlegeneration, for example, we’ve witnessed the ability to transplant human organsevolve from something that occurred only rarely to the present day, when30,000-plus transplants of organs and tissue are made in a single year.2[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en2] Our knowledge of the code of life has catapultedus from the discovery of the DNA double helix, in 1953, to the point where wecan now insert digital information from a book directly into the genetic code ofliving bacteria, and then retrieve and read that information over 20 generationslater, perfectly preserved in the DNA.3 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en3] Thesuccess of these capabilities, and a multitude of others, has led scientists tobelieve that we’re on the right track when it comes to our basic understandingof cells, life, and how the body works. The thinking is that we would not beable to accomplish the things we have if the fundamentals weren’t accurate tobegin with.Precisely because of this thinking, the new discovery that makes the essence ofthis chapter possible has come as a surprise to many scientists and everydaypeople alike. Physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson described the situation perfectlywhen he said, “The very nature of science is discoveries, and the best of thosediscoveries are the ones you don’t expect.”4 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en4] It’sbecause scientists have been extending people’s life spans using transplantedhearts, and have been doing so successfully for nearly 50 years, that afundamental shift in our understanding of the heart seems so unlikely today. Thenew evidence of heart-based intelligence, however, now makes that shiftinevitable.The Uncharted HeartThe implications of a recent discovery within the heart itself are shaking thefoundation of what we’ve been led to believe about the heart’s role in our livesand our bodies. And it all boils down to the way we answer one basic question:What is the master organ of the body?If your answer to this question is “the brain,” you’re not alone in yourthinking. When the average person is asked to identify the organ that controlsthe key functions for the body, more often than not the answer is the same:“It’s the brain. The brain is the master organ of the human body—of course!” Andit’s no surprise that it is.From Leonardo da Vinci’s day, 500 years ago, until the late 1990s, peoplethroughout the Western-educated world believed that the brain is the “conductor”leading the symphony of functions that keeps us alive and well. It’s what we’vebeen taught. It’s what we’ve been led to believe. It’s what teachers have statedwith authority. It’s the premise that doctors and health-care workers have basedlife-and-death decisions on. And it’s what most people will say when asked toidentify the role of the most important organs of the body. The belief that thebrain is the master organ of the human body has been embraced and endorsed bythe some of the most innovative scientists, academic institutions, and thinkersin modern history, and it continues to pervade mainstream thinking today.The Anatomy of the Brain page on the site for the Mayfield Clinic, affiliatedwith the University of Cincinnati’s Neurosurgery Department, beautifullyillustrates this perspective. It states:This mysterious three-pound organ [the brain] controls all necessary functionsof the body, receives and interprets information from the outside world, andembodies the essence of the mind and soul. Intelligence, creativity, emotion,and memories are a few of the many things governed by the brain.5[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en5]The belief that the brain is the control center for the body, the emotions, andmemories has been so universally accepted and so deeply ingrained in our psychesthat it’s been taken for granted almost without question—that is, until now.Today, what we thought we knew about the master organ in our bodies is changing.It has to. The reason is simple: the discoveries described in this chapter, andthe decades of research that have followed, tell us that the brain is only partof the story. While it’s certainly true that the brain’s functions includethings like perception and motor skills; information processing; and providingthe chemical trigger for everything from when we sleep and when we’re hungry toour desire for sex and the strength of our immune system, it’s also true thatthe brain can’t do these things alone—it’s only one part of a much bigger storythat is still emerging and is largely untold. It’s a story that begins in theheart.The Human Heart: More Than Just a Pump!When I was in school, I was taught that the main purpose of the heart is to moveblood through the body. I was told that the heart is a pump, plain and simple,and that its job is to pump continuously over the course of our lifetimes toaccomplish something that is extraordinary by any measure.The adult heart beats an average of 101,000 times a day, circulating some 1,900gallons of blood through 60,000 miles of arteries, blood vessels, andcapillaries! A growing of body of scientific evidence, however, now suggeststhat the pumping of the heart, as important as it is, may pale in comparisonwith the additional functions that have been recently discovered. In otherwords, while the heart indeed pumps blood powerfully and efficiently through thebody, the pumping may not be its primary purpose.As far back as 1932, scientific investigation of the role of the heart in thebody opened the door to a possibility, and a controversy, that continues tounfold to this day. In the early study, Harvard University scientist J. Bremerfilmed the movement of blood flowing through the body of a chicken early in itsdevelopment.6 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en6] So early, in fact, that the chick’sheart had not yet started functioning. What made this film so exceptional isthat Bremer was able to document the chick’s blood moving through its body, onits own, without the aid of the heart pumping it.Additional experiments to solve the mystery, performed using similar embryos,showed that the blood flowed as a series of spiral motions, like small eddycurrents, rather than in a straight line. The studies also showed that themovement continued throughout their systems even after the heart was removedfrom the body for as long as ten minutes.7 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en7]The two questions here are obvious: (1) How is it possible for the blood to flowin the embryo before the heart is even functioning? and (2) Why does the bloodcontinue flowing even after the heart itself is removed? What could be drivingthe movement of the blood? Interestingly, these questions were already answeredover ten years before the Harvard film was made. And the answer to both camefrom the same man, Austrian-born philosopher and architect Rudolf Steiner, thecreator of the Waldorf method of education and learning.In the early 1920s, Steiner had been researching the motion of fluids, includingwater and blood, in their natural environment. Steiner discovered, and laterdemonstrated, that liquids in their natural state, such as water when it’s stillin the ground and blood when it’s still inside arteries and veins, move freelyon their own due to an action that originates within the fluid itself. Andrather than flowing in a straight line, as perceived by the naked eye, thefluids follow tiny spiral patterns created by continuous microvortices tomaintain their flow. This spiral movement, Steiner believed, solved the mysteryof the blood flowing without the aid of the heart.We see the vortex motion that Steiner described on a large scale in rivers andstreams. His work demonstrated that the same principle applies on a smallerscale to the blood flowing through the vessels and capillaries of a living body.Although his research was controversial, it was well tested and documented andsuggested a closer course of study. It was viewed as so significant in his daythat he was invited to share his discoveries with esteemed medical doctors atthe renowned Goetheanum (the world center for the anthroposophical movement),located in Dornach, Switzerland. In his presentations, Steiner demonstrated thatthe heart is not the primary force that moves the blood through the body withpressure. Rather, the blood moves on its own as a result of what he called“biological momentum”—the spiraling effect that was later filmed in 1932.So while the heart definitely plays a role in the process, Steiner contendedthat it was more to serve as a booster to add momentum to the inherent motion ofthe blood, not the main reason for the motion itself. Steiner’s work was neverrefuted in his scientific circles and remains controversial today. What hedocumented early in the 20th century opens the door to an obvious question thatgoes to the core of this chapter: If the pumping of blood through the body isnot the heart’s primary purpose, then what is?Today, the implications of Steiner’s discovery continue to offer a rich sourceof insight into uncharted processes of the heart specifically and into ourrelationship with nature in general. Although medical science chose to embrace amore mechanical philosophy when it comes to the role of the heart, Steiner’swork of nearly a century ago is helping unlock the emerging mysteries thatcannot be explained with the modern thinking. And while his proposals may havesounded radical in the 1920s and ’30s, the notion that the heart is more than apump originated long before Steiner shared his discoveries.Gateway to Other WorldsAlmost universally, indigenous and mystery traditions have held the heart inhigh esteem as a gateway to the deepest wisdom of this world, as well as torealms beyond this world. The heart is mentioned 878 times in the modern Bible,for example, and the word heart appears in 59 of its 66 books. The Old Testamentdescribes the heart as a vast source of wisdom that requires a cultivatedunderstanding to make sense of. The book of Proverbs states, “Counsel in theheart of a man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw itout.”8 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en8] The same sentiment is expressed in thewisdom of the North American Omaha people, who invite us to “ask questions fromyour heart and you will be answered from the heart.” The Lotus Sutra of theMahayana Buddhist traditions teaches of the “hidden treasure of the heart.” It’sdescribed in the commentary as being “as vast as the universe itself, whichdispels any feelings of powerlessness.”9 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en9]Within passages of the collective texts known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead(originally named “The Book of Emerging Forth Into the Light”), we are carriedbeyond the words of the ancient parables and into the practice of a ceremonyinvolving the heart at the time of death. This ritual is known as “the weighingof the heart.” It’s performed to determine if the spirit of the person who hasdied will continue into the afterlife. The beautifully elaborate papyrus inFigure 1.1 on the next page shows Anubis, the jackal-headed god, weighing thephysical heart of the deceased on a scale. In this particular image, it’s theheart of an unnamed woman. Overseeing the procedure and recording the outcome tothe left of the scales is the ibis-headed god, Thoth, the scribe of the gods.On the right side of the scale is the woman’s heart. On the other side is asingle feather representing the principles of truth and justice, known as maat.The purpose of the ceremony is to see if the good deeds of the woman’s lifetimehave left her with a heart that’s in balance with the truth and justicesignified by the feather, or if the deeds of her life have left her heart soheavily burdened that it now weighs more than the feather. To the right of Thothwe see the hungry beast Ammit anticipating the result. If the heart is heavywith bad deeds, it tilts the scale and the woman is quickly devoured by Ammit.If it’s as light as the feather, the woman is allowed to pass on into theafterlife.img [images/pg8.jpg]Figure 1.1. A selection of the Egyptian Book of the Dead showing the weighing ofthe heart after death to determine if the spirit will be allowed to continueinto the afterlife. Source: Getty Images.This is one of the oldest and clearest representations of the idea that theheart is linked to the quality of life, personal memory, and moral deeds in thisworld. The record of this ceremony provides a powerful insight into a belief,long held by ancient Egyptians and a host of other traditions, regarding theheart’s role in our lives.For thousands of years, the human heart was viewed as the center of thought,emotion, memory, and personality—the master organ of the body. Traditions tohonor the role of the heart were created and passed down generation aftergeneration. Ceremonies were performed. And techniques were developed to utilizethe heart’s function as a conduit of intuition and healing.It’s only in more recent history that this view has changed. The journey of ourexploration to know ourselves has followed a trajectory that swings like apendulum. Within our lifetime we’ve seen the pendulum of thinking swing to theextreme view of the heart as an isolated pump that can be serviced and replacedlike a machine as it ages. And now the same science that once preferred such anextreme view is coming back, as the pendulum of thinking returns to a find a newbalance. This time the balance is inviting us to rethink the modern ideas ofwhich organ we can honestly identify as the master of the human body.Which Organ Runs the Body—the Heart or the Brain?Over 3,000 years after the Egyptian Book of the Dead was created, artist andinventor Leonardo da Vinci initiated some of the first scientific attempts tounlock the secrets of the human body. He was especially interested in the brain:what it does, and how it works. He was fascinated by the fact that it isdirectly connected to so many parts of the body, including the heart, and evenbelieved that it could be the home to the soul while the body is alive. While daVinci obviously didn’t have the technological advantages that we enjoy today,such as x-rays and MRIs, he had another powerful advantage that has sincedisappeared. It’s the advantage that comes from a particular way of thinking.Contrary to modern thinking that has separated the study of art from science,Leonardo da Vinci insisted that the two ways of knowing are complementary—andeven necessary to one another, if we are to master a particular field of study.For example, da Vinci’s skill as an artist made it possible for him to documenthis work with animal and human cadavers without a modern camera, and to recordwhat he found in the laboratory to share with his students, as well as futuregenerations. It was the combination of these skills that led da Vinci to createthe first scientific illustration of the heart’s connection to major organs inthe body. And he did so in a truly innovative way.During the dissection of an ox cadaver, da Vinci reasoned that if he poured hotwax directly into the cavities of the brain, he could see how the network ofblood vessels, arteries, and capillaries was connected. While the wax was stillliquid, it flowed through the vessels and capillaries just as the blood did whenthe ox was alive. As the wax cooled, what remained was the equivalent of 3-Dmodel showing the path where the blood flowed in the brain.The good news is that da Vinci’s model led him beyond the theories of the brainas a lonely, isolated organ in the head. The wax model clearly showed that thebrain is a central point of connection—a crossroads directly linking nerves andblood vessels to other parts of the body, including the heart.This is where da Vinci got it absolutely right. The connections that hedocumented helped scientists and doctors make life-and-death decisions when itcame to tending to injuries from war and treating contemporary diseases.The rest of the story is where he was “sort of” right.While the wax models did show the physical connections between major organs,they couldn’t show what was happening within the connections themselves. In hisday, da Vinci had no way of detecting the subtle (1) electrical signals and (2)pulse waves created by a living, beating heart that that travel along thepathways he’d discovered. Due to these limitations, da Vinci concluded thatbecause the brain was so connected to the other organs, it must be the masterorgan of the body. And his method and his models were so convincing that hisconclusion held sway for over 500 years as a basic tenet of physiology andmedicine.For the five-plus centuries since da Vinci’s time, the belief has been thateverything from when we wake up and go to sleep, to how much and how fast wegrow, the actions of our immune system, our sex drive, and the five senses thatconnect us with the world are all regulated by the brain. Without a doubt, thebrain’s role in those functions, and many more, is clearly documented. The keyis that the brain doesn’t act alone. The surprising discovery of a neuralnetwork—brain-like cells located within the heart itself—communicating with thebrain is changing the way we think about the “master organ” of the body.A growing body of evidence now suggests that the brain is one half of a powersplit when it comes to regulating the functions that keep us alive andbalanced—sharing the role of co-master with the heart.Growing evidence suggests that heart and the brain work together to share therole of the body’s master organs—two separate organs connected through a commonnetwork of information.When we think about this statement, it should come as no surprise that the heartwould play such a vital role in the body. After all, it’s the heart, not thebrain, that’s the first organ to form in utero, at about six weeks afterconception. And it’s the pulse from our first heartbeat that sets into motionthe cascade of developments leading to the formation of the other organs in ourbodies. As we develop, the heart begins to work in harmony with the brain toregulate these vital physiological functions in ways that science is onlybeginning to recognize. Beyond the physical pumping that we can see and measurewith conventional technology, now we know that the heart does much more. Thediscovery of specialized cells within the heart itself that are commonly foundin the brain has opened the door to new and intriguing possibilities when itcomes to what this organ means in our lives.The “Little Brain” in the HeartIn 1991, a scientific discovery published in a peer-reviewed journal put to restany lingering doubt regarding the heart’s multifaceted role in the body. Thename of the article gives us a clue to the discovery: “Neurocardiology.” It’sall about the intimate relationship between our hearts and brains. The discoverydescribed this powerful relationship that had been unrecognized in the past. Ateam of scientists, led by Dr. J. Andrew Armour of the University of Montreal,discovered that about 40,000 specialized neurons, called sensory neurites, forma communication network within the heart itself.For clarity, the term neuron describes a specialized cell that can be excited(electrically stimulated) in a way that allows it to share information withother cells in the body. While large numbers of neurons are obviouslyconcentrated in the brain and along the spinal cord, the discovery of thesecells in the heart, and in smaller numbers within other organs, offers newinsight into the level of communication that exists throughout the body. Theneurites are tiny projections that come from the main body of the neuron itselfto perform different functions. Some carry information away from the neuron toconnect with other cells, while others detect signals from various sources andcarry them toward the neuron. What makes this discovery so exceptional is thatthe neurites in the heart duplicate many of the same functions found in thebrain.img [images/pg12.jpg]Figure 1.2. An illustration of a neuron showing the various projections(neurites), such as dendrites to the left and the axons to the right, that carryinformation to and from the cell body. Source: Public Domain.In simple terms, Armour and his team discovered what has come to be known as the“little brain” in the heart. And it is the specialized neurites that make thelittle brain possible. In the words of the scientists who made the discovery,“the ‘heart brain’ is an intricate network of nerves, neurotransmitters,proteins and support cells similar to those found in the brain proper.”10[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en10]A key role of the brain in the heart is to detect changes within the body, suchas levels of hormones and other chemicals, and then to communicate those changesto the brain so it can meet our needs accordingly. The heart brain does this byconverting the language of the body—chemistry—into the electrical language ofthe nervous system so that it makes sense to the brain. The heart’s codedmessages inform the brain as to when we need more adrenaline in a stressfulsituation, for example, or when it’s safe to create less adrenaline and focus onbuilding a stronger immune response. Since the little brain in the heart hasbeen recognized, its role in a number of functions not so readily acknowledgedin the past have also come to light.These functions include: * Providing the heart-based wisdom known as “heart intelligence” * Promoting intentional states of deep intuition * Allowing for intentional precognitive abilities * Directing the heart’s communication with sensory neurites in other organs in the bodyThe heart’s little brain has been found to function in two distinct yet relatedways. It can act . . . 1. . . . independently of the cranial brain to think, learn, remember, and even sense our inner and outer worlds on its own. 2. . . . in harmony with the cranial brain to give us the benefit of a single, potent neural network shared by the two separate organs.Dr. Armour’s discovery has forever changed the way we’ve been taught to think ofourselves. It gives new meaning to what’s possible and what we’re capable ofwhen it comes to the roles played by the heart and the brain in the body. In Dr.Armour’s own words, “It has become clear in recent years that a sophisticatedtwo-way communication occurs between the heart and the brain, with eachinfluencing the other’s function.”11 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en11]The new field of neurocardiology, the science exploring what such a discoverymeans, is just beginning to catch up with the reality of our everydayexperience. This is especially apparent when we examine the principles offeredin some of our most ancient and cherished spiritual traditions.As mentioned previously in this chapter, indigenous traditions have long heldthat the heart plays a vital role in our lives far beyond that of a muscularpump. While the “heart as pump” thinking is not discounted in these traditions,it’s the virtues of the heart beyond a pump that are emphasized in the wisdom ofthe past. Almost universally, historical teachings elevate the heart’s role to alevel where it has direct influence upon our personality, our daily lives, andour ability to make moral choices that include the distinguishing of good andevil, the discernment of right from wrong.Coptic saint Macarius, founder of the ancient Egyptian monastery that bears hisname, powerfully captured these levels of potential within the heart, saying:The heart itself is but a little vessel, and yet there are dragons, and therelions, and there venomous beasts, and all the treasures of wickedness; and thereare rough uneven ways, there chasms; there likewise is God, there the angels,there life and the kingdom, there light and the apostles, there the heavenlycities, there the treasures, there are all things.12[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en12]Among the “all things” that St. Macarius described, we must now include the newdiscoveries that document the ability of our hearts to remember life events—evenwhen the organ is no longer in the body of the person who experienced thoseevents.Same Heart, Different Body: The Memories RemainOne of the mysteries of human heart transplants is that the heart, once removedfrom its original owner, continues to beat and is able to resume functioningafter it’s placed in a new body. The crux of the mystery is this: If the brainis truly the master organ of the body, sending instructions to the heart, thenhow can the heart continue to function after it has lost its connection to thebrain that issues those instructions?The following true-life accounts, and the discovery they led to, shed a powerfullight on this mystery and offer new insight into the deeper role of our heart inour lives.The first successful human heart transplant took place in Cape Town, SouthAfrica, on December 3, 1967. On that day Dr. Christian Barnard placed the heartof a 25-year-old woman who had been in a fatal automobile accident into the bodyof Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old man with a damaged heart. From a medicalstandpoint, the procedure was an overwhelming success. The transplant wassuccessful, and the woman’s heart immediately began functioning within the man’sbody just as the transplant team had expected.One of the biggest hurdles in all transplants, including Washkansky’s, is thatthe immune system of the person receiving the heart (or any organ, for thatmatter) does not recognize the tissue of the new organ as its own and tries toreject the “foreign” tissue. For this reason doctors use specialized drugs tosuppress the recipient’s immune system and “trick” the body into accepting thenew organ. The good news is that this technique is effective in reducing thechance of rejection. The success comes with a high price for doing so, however.With the severely weakened immune system, the person receiving the new organbecomes susceptible to infections such as common colds, flu, and pneumonia.And this is precisely what happened with the world’s first human hearttransplant. Although Louis Washkansky’s new heart functioned perfectly until hislast breath, he died 18 days after his transplant from complications ofpneumonia. His survival with a new heart for over two weeks demonstrated that anorgan transplant was a viable possibility in cases where an otherwise healthybody loses an organ to accident or disease.In the decades that have followed Dr. Barnard’s first transplant, the procedureshave been modified and perfected to the point that human heart transplants nowhappen on a routine basis. In 2014, there were approximately 5,000 hearttransplants performed worldwide. And while the number sounds high, when it iscompared to the list of 50,000 people waiting for a heart from a donor, it’sclear that the demand for organ donors will remain high for the foreseeablefuture.The reason why I’m sharing the background of heart transplants here is that ithas a direct connection to the theme of this chapter. From the time of the firstprocedures, there has always been a curious phenomenon that’s now acknowledgedin the medical community as a possible side effect of a heart transplant. One ofthe earliest examples was documented by the direct experience of a woman namedClaire Sylvia, who received such a transplant in 1988. Her book A Change ofHeart: A Memoir is a personal account of how life’s memories can be preservedwithin the heart itself.Sylvia, a onetime professional dancer, had successfully received the heart andthe lungs of a donor whose identity was not initially disclosed. Not long afterher operation, she began to crave foods that she’d never been especially drawnto in the past, such as chicken nuggets and green peppers. And when it came tothe nuggets, the cravings were very specific. Sylvia found herself inexplicablydrawn to the restaurant chain KFC to satisfy her cravings. As she had neverdeveloped a taste for these kind of foods before her surgery, her friends,family members, and doctor were mystified.Just before her operation, she’d been told that she was receiving the organs ofa young man who had died in a motorcycle accident. Although the details ofdonors are generally not shared with recipients, Sylvia followed up on thisinformation and discovered the identity of the young man in a local obituary,along with the address of his parents. It was during a visit with them thatSylvia learned some of the details of the life of their son, Tim, whose heartand lungs were now in her body. And those details confirmed in her mind what shealready sensed to be true intuitively—Tim loved precisely the kind of chickennuggets and green peppers that she was now craving.13[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en13] It was clear that Tim’s desire for the foods heenjoyed in his lifetime were now part of Sylvia’s experience and that she hadacquired her cravings through the phenomenon of memory transference.While Claire Sylvia’s story is one of the earliest and best-documented accountsof memory transference through an organ transplant, opening the door to theserious study and eventual acceptance of the phenomenon, additional exampleshave surfaced since. In each one, there is a change in the personality of theperson with the new heart. The changes range from preferences with respect todiet and specific foods, to shifts in personality type—from bubbly and outgoingto shy, for instance—and even to the sexual orientation of the recipient . . .all to reflect the inclinations and lifestyle of the donor.And while the examples of personality and sexual-orientation changes arefascinating, the stories don’t end there. The emotional content of our livesappears to be so deeply ingrained into our hearts’ memory that it is preservedwith tremendous clarity, and commonly reexperienced, by the person receiving theheart in a transplant. While skeptics of the heart-memory theories have proposeda number of alternative explanations for the post-transplant changes inpersonality and lifestyle, including drug reactions and subconscious influences,there’s a particular kind of experience that cannot be explained away by thedisbelievers’ theories. It’s this kind of documented case history that has ledto the acceptance of memory transference as a fact of life rather than a curiouscoincidence.In 1999, Dr. Paul Pearsall, a neuropsychologist, published a pioneering bookdocumenting case histories of the heart’s memory: The Heart’s Code: Tapping theWisdom and Power of Our Heart Energy. It included true-life accounts of thememories, dreams, and even nightmares experienced by people who had received atransplanted heart. What made one of the accounts so extraordinary is that therecipient’s experiences could be confirmed as factual events that happened inthe donor’s lifetime. The case involved an eight-year-old girl who received aheart from another girl two years older.Almost immediately after the surgery, the young girl began having vivid andfrightening dreams—nightmares—of being chased, attacked, and killed. While hertransplant was a success technically, the psychological impact continued. Shewas eventually referred to a psychiatrist for a mental-health evaluation. Theevents and images that the young girl described were so clear, consistent, anddetailed that the psychiatrist was convinced the dreams were more than a curiousby-product of the transplant. She felt that they were describing the memory of areal-life experience. The question was: Whom did the memory belong to?Law enforcement was eventually brought into the case, and it was quicklydiscovered that the girl was recounting the details of an unsolved murder thathad occurred locally in the town. She shared the specifics of where, when, andhow the murder had happened. She even repeated the words that were spoken duringthe attack and the name of the murderer. Based on the details she provided,police were able to locate and arrest a man who fit the circumstances anddescription. Eventually he was put on trial and convicted of the assault andmurder of the ten-year girl whose heart was now in the body of theeight-year-old.14 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en14]I’m sharing this account because it tells us how real the brain in the heart is,and how it can function in ways that it was once thought only the cranial braindid.The discovery of the “little brain” in the heart, and the now-verified evidenceof its ability to think and remember, has opened the door to a vast array ofpossibilities when it comes to the hidden power of the heart and what it meansin our lives. For 150-plus years, we’ve been led to think of the heart and thebrain from an either-or perspective. Scientists, engineers, and analyticalproblem solvers have felt that the brain is the key, and they’ve oftendiscounted the heart. At the same time, artists, musicians, and intuitivethinkers have felt that the heart is the key and have readily dismissed theimportance of the thinking capacity of the brain. It’s now apparent why thiseither-or thinking generally doesn’t work out so well. To separate the brainfrom the heart gives us an incomplete picture of ourselves. Clearly, it’s moreabout both organs working together than it is about focusing on one or the otherexclusively. And the more we know about how the heart and the brain worktogether, the more we can use this understanding to unlock the secrets of ourgreatest potential!Max Planck’s MatrixThe previous sections offer examples of the heart’s role that sound almostmystical in nature. And maybe that’s why these capabilities have been largelyrelegated to the realm of spirituality, religion, and mysticism in the past.It’s because the theories and explanations of science were lagging behind theactual experiences that people were having in their lives. From ESP(extrasensory perception) and precognition, to mothers intuitively knowing whentheir sons and daughters are in trouble on the battlefield before the news hasreached military command posts, humans have been experiencing—and benefitingfrom—the extraordinary power of their hearts for centuries. And it’s no surprisethat they have.These experiences are natural, and they’re a natural part of us. They are partof the human experience. And to deny the existence of heart-based wisdom is todeny a vital part of our being. A big factor in why the scientific community hasbeen uncomfortable with such heart-based experiences is because they seem toinvolve a realm that science has traditionally avoided. That realm implies theexistence of a field of energy that connects all things and makes intuitiveexperiences possible.A series of discoveries in the late 20th and early 21st century now give newmeaning, and new context, to this thinking, as well as our most intimateexperiences of life, nature, and love. And the only way to make sense of theexperiences and develop them in our lives is to understand what they are and whythey’re possible.img [images/common.jpg]During a lecture presented in 1944, the author of quantum theory, physicist MaxPlanck, made a statement that was unexpected, and maybe even shocking, to thescientists of the day. Using words that sounded mystical and to some peoplealmost spiritual, Planck said,As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to thestudy of matter, I can tell you as the result of my research about the atoms,this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists byvirtue of a force that brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holdsthis most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behindthis force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is thematrix of all matter.15 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en15]Beyond any reasonable doubt, scientific experiments (such as those detailed inmy book The Divine Matrix [Hay House, 2007]) demonstrate that “the matrix”exists. (The movie of the same name is based on Planck’s idea that there is aworld we can’t see that influences the world we live in.) Regardless of what wechoose to call it or which existing laws of physics it may or may not conformto, the field of subtle energy that connects everything in creation is real. Itexcludes nothing. It exists as you and as me. It’s the universe within us, aswell as the universe around us. It’s the quantum bridge between all that ispossible in our minds and hearts and what becomes real in the world.It’s this matrix of energy that explains why quantum particles remain deeplyconnected and respond to each other even when they’re separated by thousands ofmiles or more on the physical level. It also explains why we do the same thing.It explains the intuition between a mother and her child, whether that child isin the next room or on the other side of the planet. It explains why people witha deep, heart-based connection seem to “know” what’s happening with one anotherbefore the words are ever spoken.Today, over 70 years after Planck’s now-famous lecture describing what he calledthe matrix that connects all matter, modern science has refined ourunderstanding of precisely what the matrix is and what it means. The bottom lineis that we’re bathed in a field of energy that’s everywhere, always present, andone that has existed since time began with the big bang. The existence of thisfield implies three principles that have a direct effect upon the way we live,all that we do, and the role of our hearts in our lives. And while some of theprinciples may contradict well-established beliefs of both science andspirituality, they’re also the principles that open the door to an empoweringand life-affirming way of seeing our world and living our lives.1. The first principle suggests that because everything exists within a matrixof energy, everything is connected. It’s this connection that makes deep statesof intuition between people and patterns between significant life eventspossible.2. The second principle suggests that the matrix of the universe isholographic—meaning that any portion of the field contains everything in thefield. As consciousness itself is believed to be holographic, this means thatphysical space between people and the “things” they experience is not a barrierto the deep connections made possible through heart intelligence. In otherwords, there is no reason to think it’s easier to tune in to our loved ones ifthey’re in the next room than it is if they’re on another continent. Thehologram promises that within the realm that the heart operates, if somethingexists anywhere, it exists everywhere.3. The third principle suggests that the past, present, and future areintimately joined. The matrix appears to be the container that holds time,providing for a continuity between the experiences of our present and those ofour future. It’s this principle that makes the experience of precognitionpossible in our lives.Regardless of what we call it, or how science and religion define it, it isclear that there is something out there—a force, a field, a presence—that is thegreat “net” that links us with one another, our world, and a greater presence.It’s also clear that there is a single organ in our bodies that is designed tosense and communicate with that field—the heart. The heart generates thestrongest known energy fields in the human body; electrically, it’s between 40to 60 times stronger than the brain.If we can truly grasp what these discoveries tell us about our relationship toone another, the world, and beyond, then the events of our everyday lives takeon an entirely new meaning. We become participants in, rather than victims of,forces we cannot see and do not understand. To be in such a place is where ourempowerment really begins.Deep Intuition: On DemandAs mentioned previously, the term heart intelligence encompasses a number ofexperiences that have historically been beyond the pale of scientificexploration, including intuition, precognition, and the ability to access oursubconscious minds. While it’s probably safe to say that we’ve all had one ormore of these experiences at some point in our lives, it’s also probably safe tosay that they appear to be random and spontaneous. Unless we’re trained tocreate the conditions that make them possible, they seem to happen when theywant to, rather than when we want them to.My weekly call with my mother is a perfect example of this spontaneousconnection. There was a time in my life when I had a routine phone call with mymother every week. From the time I left my childhood home to go to college untiljust a few years ago when mom’s health prevented us from continuing our ritual,I looked forward to our Sunday-afternoon connection. Following her divorce frommy father in the mid-1960s, my mom chose to live alone. Our physical visits werefew and far between, and it was the weekly phone calls that kept us in touch.And there was a mystery that would often occur during those Sunday calls.Frequently I would pick up the phone to dial my mom’s number, only to find heralready on the line waiting for me. And while it didn’t happen every Sunday, ithappened often enough that I came to expect it more often than not. I would pickup the receiver with the intention of dialing her number, only to hear her voicealready on the line without the phone ever even ringing.“Hello!” she’d say. “This is Mom.”“I know,” I’d answer. “I was just going to dial you up, but you’re alreadyhere.”She was less surprised than I was by the whole thing, and more playful. “See,”she’d say. “We’re just so psychic! Our ESP is working today!”We’d laugh, and it was always a great way to begin our weekly catch-up. Mostpeople have had similar telephone connections with another person at some pointin their lives. The reason I’m sharing the story here is to illustrate twopoints:— First, for two people to pick up the phone at precisely the same instant tellsus that we’re responding to an impulse to do so. When we’re separated byhundreds or even thousands of miles, the impulse connecting us has to travelthrough something; some medium that allows for the connection to exist. Just theway the melody of our favorite song travels as sound waves through the air toreach our ears, our hearts’ intention to connect must travel through something(Planck’s matrix) to prompt us to respond by picking up the phone at just theright time. A second sooner or a second later and the connection would not work.— Second, our connection is usually not a conscious thought. We’ll be goingabout our day and suddenly have a spontaneous impulse, a “gut” feeling, to pickup the phone and make the call. The fact that it happens spontaneously tells usthat we’re communicating on a level that is beyond our thinking minds; we’reresponding to a subconscious cue. When it comes to intuitive experiences in ourlives, we almost immediately discover two nearly universal themes when it comesto our impulse to connect: 1. It’s generally not a conscious thought. 2. It happens spontaneously when we’re not expecting it.I’m sharing these themes because I want to contrast them with what becomespossible when we take our intuition off “autopilot” and learn to create theconditions of deep intuition at will—our intuition on demand.Many of the recent discoveries regarding heart intelligence and what it means inour lives have been made by scientists at the Institute of HeartMath (IHM), apioneering research organization dedicated to understanding the full potentialof the human heart.16 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en16] Following the developmentalwork that led to the techniques used by IHM today, the groundwork was laid forthe founding of the organization in the early 1990s.Similar to the conclusions reached by scientists early in the 20th century, IHMstudies suggest that the function of our hearts runs much deeper, and much moresubtly, than has been recognized in the past. If we can understand theconditions in the body that support our intuition, then we have the opportunityto re-create those conditions at will, when we choose, rather than waiting forthem to happen occasionally in our lives.A 2007 study conducted by IHM provided some of the first scientific evidenceregarding what intuition really means and how it arises. The purpose of thestudy was to investigate the intuitive relationship that is common between amother and her child. The study was based upon previous findings showing that“signals generated by the heart have the capacity to affect others around us.”17[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en17]In this particular study, monitors were used to gauge both the mother’s brainwaves (measured as a conventional EEG), as well as the baby’s heartbeat(measured as a conventional EKG), while the mother held the baby in her lap. Thethinking was that it’s the interaction between the electrical fields of baby’sheartbeat and the electrical fields of the mother’s brain that alerts her to herbaby’s needs. The study reported that at first, the baby’s heartbeat wasundetectable in the mother’s brain. However, when the mother was asked to shifther attention and focus specifically upon her baby, the pattern in her brainchanged in a profound and, for some people, unexpected way. When the motherfocused her attention on her baby, the heartbeat of her baby was detected withinher brain waves. The study concluded that by shifting her awareness to her baby,the mother became more sensitive to the electromagnetic signals of her baby’sheart.While this study has meaning for many areas of our lives, the reason I’m sharingit here is best summarized by the scientists themselves: “These findings haveintriguing implications, suggesting that a mother in a psychophysiologicallycoherent state became more sensitive to the subtle electromagnetic informationencoded in the electromagnetic signals of her infant.”18[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en18]Continuing studies by IHM and others now suggest that the language of thisconclusion can be expanded beyond a mother and her baby to include our abilityto tune in to the subtle fields of other people, and their hearts’ intentions,regardless of the distance between us and them. Perhaps not surprisingly, thestudy results parallel what happened between my mother and me on the occasion ofthose Sunday-afternoon phone calls. They also help us understand how the motherof a son or daughter serving in combat half a world away can be so attuned towhat’s happening in his or her life.When we create psychophysical coherence within ourselves (commonly shortened tosimply “coherence”), we become more sensitive to the information from otherpeople and the world around us. And perhaps most important, we become moresensitive to the information within ourselves. Specifically, we empowerourselves to create deep states of intuition on demand, at will, when we choose.It’s this ability that empowers the heart wisdom and heart intelligence that inthe past may have seemed sporadic and fleeting.Creating heart-brain coherence empowers us to experience deep states ofintuition and to do so on demand.Creating Your Heart-Brain ConnectionThe 2007 study of the mother and her baby opens the door to a number of profoundinsights and powerful opportunities when it comes to creating extraordinarystates of awareness intentionally. The science confirming the heartbeat of thebaby in the mother’s brain waves takes the conversation of us being connectedwith one another out of the realm of possibility and “maybe,” and places itdirectly into the real world of everyday life. It shows clearly that byharmonizing our heart and our brain we open the door to consistently creatingintuitive experiences that may have been only spontaneous and sporadic in thepast. If we can learn to harmonize our heartbeat with our brain waves, we openthe door to the kind of intuition for ourselves that the mother has with herbaby.Fortunately, over two decades’ research pioneered by IHM have developed thetechniques to help us do precisely that. Playwright and 20th-centurycongresswoman Clare Boothe Luce once said, “The height of sophistication issimplicity.”19 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en19] I think there’s a lot of truth toher words, and the simplicity that she mentions applies especially to nature.Nature is simple and elegant until we make it difficult through awkwarddescriptions and complex formulas. So what could be more natural than simplyconnecting the “little brain” in our hearts to the brains in our heads to createa single potent network of harmony in our lives? This is what the technique ofheart-brain coherence is all about.img [images/common2.jpg]In each moment of every day, a conversation is taking place inside us. Without adoubt, it’s one of the most vital communications we will ever find ourselvesengaged in. It’s the silent, often subconscious, and never-ending conversationof emotion-based signals between our hearts and our brains. The reason thisconversation is so important is because the quality of the emotional signal ourhearts sends to our brains determines what kind of chemicals our brains releaseinto our bodies.When we feel what we would typically call negative emotions (for instance,anger, hate, jealousy, and rage), our hearts send a signal to our brains thatmirrors our feelings. Such emotions are irregular and chaotic, and this isprecisely what the signal they send to the brain looks like. If you can envisiona chart of the ups and downs of the stock market on a wild and volatile day,you’ll have an idea of the kind of signals we create in our hearts in times ofchaos. (See Chapter 2 [chapter02.xhtml], Figure 2.1 [chapter02.xhtml#fig_2_1].)The human body interprets this kind of signal as stress, and triggers themechanisms to help us respond appropriately. The stress from negative emotionsincreases the levels of cortisol and adrenaline—often called stress hormones,which prepare us for a quick and powerful reaction to whatever is causing usstress—in our bloodstreams. This is our instinctive fight-or-flight response.The research has shown that when we create rejuvenating emotions, such asappreciation, care, gratitude, and compassion, the signal from heart to brainbecomes more harmonized to reflect the quality of the emotions. In the presenceof a harmonized signal, there is no need for the fight-or-flight response. Thestress hormones decrease, allowing the heart and brain to shift and produce thechemistry that supports stronger immune response and greater amounts of DHEA,the precursor to all other hormones in the body.Whether it’s based in emotions from stress or harmony, the conversation betweenheart and brain—specifically, between the sensory neurites in our hearts andthose that make up our brains—is constantly occurring as a dialogue of very lowfrequencies. It’s this conversation that creates the harmony of heart-braincoherence described previously. When the coherence is optimal, the frequency isapproximately 0.10 Hertz. This is indeed a very low vibration, below thethreshold of 20 Hertz, which is typically the lowest frequency humans can detectwith the unaided ear. The 0.10 Hertz frequency is, however, detectable by otherforms of life, including whales and some kinds of fish. And it’s this frequencythat’s believed to play a vital role in the subconscious cues we detect whenwe’re in the presence of other hearts: the “vibes” that we sense from people aswell as some animals. What’s important for us here is that the quality of thesignal, our heart-brain coherence, is directly linked to the quality of emotionwe feel in our hearts.This is one of those places where science and spirituality overlap beautifully.While the science describes the electrical relationship between the heart andthe brain, ancient spiritual practices and techniques have helped people applythe relationship in their lives—and do so without a scientific explanation. It’sprobably no coincidence that the rigorous scientific techniques developed by theresearchers at IHM closely parallel some of the techniques of ancient traditionspreserved in the monasteries and indigenous lore of the past. We all learn indifferent ways, and my sense is that when something is true, it appears in theworld in different forms to reflect the variations in our learning.With this idea in mind, I’ve chosen to share the IHM technique, with permission,because it’s safe, is based in well-researched science that validates the steps,and has been simplified in a way that makes it accessible and easy to use in oureveryday lives.As with any technique that’s passed from teacher to student, however, the stepsfor creating heart-brain coherence are best experienced with a seasonedpractitioner to facilitate the process. So while I will describe the principlesto create your heart-brain coherence in the following paragraphs, I encourageyou to experience them for yourself using the no-cost, online instructions foundat https://www.heartmath.org/resources/heartmath-tools/[https://www.heartmath.org/resources/heartmath-tools/]quick-coherence-technique-for-adults or through the guidance of a certifiedinstructor.20 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en20]The technique to create heart-brain coherence is appropriately called the QuickCoherence® Technique and has been refined into two simple steps. Independently,each step sends a signal to the body that a specific shift has been put intomotion. Combined, the steps create an experience that takes us back to a naturalharmony that existed in our bodies earlier in life, before we began to separateour heart-brain network through our conditioning.Steps for Quick Coherence® * Step 1: Heart Focus. Shift your focus into the area of your heart, and begin to breathe a little more slowly than usual, as if your breath is coming from your heart. This step is a powerful technique unto itself and can be used when you’re feeling overwhelmed by the day’s events or simply desire to be more connected with yourself. As you slow your breathing, you are sending a signal to your body in general, and your heart specifically, that you are in a place that is safe and it’s okay to turn your attention inward. * Step 2: Activate a Positive Feeling. Make a sincere attempt to experience a regenerative feeing such as appreciation or care for someone or something in your life. The key in this step is to first create the feeling, to the best of your ability, and then to embrace the feeling, again to the best of your ability. Your ability to sustain the feeling is what maintains the optimal conversation between your heart and your brain.As with any skill, you’ll find, I think, that the more you practice creatingcoherence between your heart and your brain, the easier it becomes to do so. Andwith that ease, the more natural the experience begins to feel. With the growinglevel of ease, you’ll also discover your ability to sustain the connection forlonger periods of time.I’ve used these skills personally over the years, and I can say to you from mydirect experience that they work. And I’ve found that they do so in anysituation. Whether it’s emotional preparation before I enter into a difficultconversation or phone call, in response to the unexpected shock of bad news fromfriends or family, or a physical preparation before I begin a yoga or musicalrecording session, the bottom line for me is that everything goes better withcoherence. And just to be clear about what I’m saying here, I view this abilityof creating harmony in the body as a preparation that allows us to be at ourbest for whatever we choose to follow it with. So it’s not something to bethought of as an “either-or” situation where our heart-brain coherence replacesanother long-cherished practice. Rather, it’s the key to honoring our favoritepractices by being our best as we embrace them.By now the benefits of heart-brain coherence, and how to create it in our lives,should be clear. Once we’re in this space of balance and harmony within thebody, we also find ourselves in harmony with the world beyond it. It’s thisharmony that includes our healing connection with the field described earlier inthis chapter: nature’s matrix. And it’s from this place of harmony that thetruly extraordinary experiences can become a normal part of our lives. Asdifferent as intuition, precognition, and regenerative healing may sound fromone another, they all are made available to us as we harmonize our body with theworld through harmonizing our heart and our brain.Accessing Heart IntelligenceHave you ever been faced with a decision that seemed impossible to make? Maybeit was a question as to whether or not to go forward with a medical procedurethat wasn’t aligned with your belief system; maybe it was whether to stay in adifficult relationship or end it; or maybe it was a question that, if answeredthe wrong way, could have life-and-death consequences for you or a loved one?The one thing that links these questions together—as different are they are fromone another—is that none of them has an absolute answer. For each situationthere is no “right” or “wrong.” There is no truth book you can turn to that willtell you which answer to choose. And if you’ve ever been in a situation whereyou had to make this kind of decision, you probably discovered that every friendyou asked for help had a unique opinion as to which path was right for you, soyou ended up with a collection of opinions that make the original question evenmore confusing.Or maybe something else happened. Perhaps you did follow the recommendation of aclose friend or relative who meant well in trying to help. Or you tried theage-old solution of answering your question by making a list of pros and cons.This was my mother’s advice when I was faced with tough choices as a child.“On a sheet of paper, make two columns,” she would say. “Title one ‘Pros’ forthe good things about your choice and the other ‘Cons’ for the things that arenot so good. Then you’ll have your answer. And if that doesn’t work, go ask yourfather.”I can tell you from experience that neither of these solutions works. Before heleft our family when I was ten years old, my father was largely unavailable whenit came to the big questions of life. So if my mother couldn’t answer myquestion, I had few places to turn to. And the list that my mother would ask meto make always seemed to be skewed in favor of what I wanted the answer to be,rather than what the best answer really was. The reason why it’s so difficult tomake big decisions that have no clear answer is directly linked to the way we’vebeen conditioned to think.For most of us who were born and raised in modern society, it’s been all aboutthinking with the brain. And while there are times when it definitely serves usto use the logic of our brain, such as when we’re creating step-by-step plans tobuild our home, solve a complex mathematical problem or lay out the steps forincome security for our future, there are also times when we actually limitourselves by answering life’s big questions through logic alone. Left-brainthinking can be a slow and cumbersome process and there are two primary reasonswhy this is so:1. Our thought-based answers are typically based upon the filters of ourperceptions and past experience * When it comes to our role in an intimate relationship, for example, our logic-based decision is made through the filters of our self-perceptions. Our minds will make the choice to continue a relationship or to end it through the lens of our self-esteem, our sense of personal worth, our perspective that life is about struggle or ease, and so forth.2. The mind tends to justify the answers it arrives at using circularreasoning—a way of thinking that supports the conclusion by restating itself. * An example of circular reasoning would be if I were to say to you “I like Bon Jovi because it’s my favorite band.” The “circular” part of the reasoning is shown by my stating the same thought twice—I like the band because it’s my favorite band—and using the second thought to justify the first. This kind of reasoning can play out in unexpected ways, such as our fear of taking a chance with a new and challenging job that’s been offered to us. In this instance, the circular logic goes something like this: I already have a safe position in this company –> if I accept the new job and the new responsibilities, I may not be able to meet the expectations that come with it –> if I lose the new job, I’m not safe –> I already have a safe position in this company.For clarity, I’m not suggesting that either of the preceding characteristics ofmental problem solving is bad—or good, for that matter. What I am saying here isthat there are different kinds of challenges in life that are best solvedthrough different ways of thinking: some with the brain and some with the heart.And while heart-based thinking may be less familiar in our fast world oftechnology and digital information, in a very real sense it is perhaps the mostsophisticated technology we’ll ever know. The linking of the heart’s and brain’spotential through creating coherence between them is nothing less than a portalto the information of other realms, and a direct conduit to the very real fieldthat Max Planck called “the matrix” in his 1944 lecture. It’s also thefoundation of some of the most ancient and cherished traditions of our past.In the native traditions of the Midwest, where I was born, there is a term forheart wisdom that has no direct equivalent in the English language. I love theterm, however, and think of it often when I find myself in a tough situation orfaced with a difficult choice in life: chante ista (pronounced “shawn-tayeeshta”). It’s a phrase from the language of the Lakota Sioux (similar phrasesexist in some other traditions) that roughly translates as “the single eye ofthe heart.”The discovery of the “little brain” in the heart now gives new meaning to thisphrase and the role it can play in our lives. It doesn’t use the slow filters ofpast experience to make its decisions. The single eye of the heart—the state ofharmony that we create for ourselves in heart-brain coherence—accesses what’strue for us in the moment of a given situation. Rather than thinking through alist of the pros and cons or weighing out the probability that an experience ofthe past will repeat itself in the present, our heart intelligence knowsinstantly what’s true for us in the moment.Whether we choose to accept or ignore our intuitive impressions, they’re therefor us nonetheless. This is true when it comes to how we feel about otherpeople, as well as our instincts when making big choices in our lives.Scientific studies into the accuracy of our first impressions regarding trustinganother person perfectly exemplify this kind of intuition that we’ve allexperienced at some point in our lives.A study led by Alex Todorov, a Princeton University psychologist, showed thatwhen we meet another person for the first time, our assessment of that person isalmost immediate. “We need only a few milliseconds” he says. “The brain makes it[the judgment] even before it identifies the gender or appearance of the otherperson.”21 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en21]When we contemplate how quickly we form our opinion of someone we’ve never met,it actually makes perfect sense. It’s nature’s way of keeping us safe. Ourancestors, for example, didn’t have the luxury of hours to get to know thepeople they came face-to-face with as they wandered the earth in search of foodand a hospitable climate. They didn’t get to sit down with a leisurely cup oftea and ask about the mutual interests, family histories, or the favoritepastimes of the person wrapped in a bear hide looming over them with spear inhand. They had to know quickly, almost instantaneously, whether or not they weresafe. And if they weren’t, they needed to react. Knowing the answers to thesequestions within a millisecond or two gave them the time do so.Although the circumstances of life have certainly changed with modern society,our basic experience remains much the same. When we meet someone for the firsttime, we still need to know as quickly as possible (1) if we are safe and (2) ifthe person we’ve met can be trusted. This is true in business; with friendships;and especially when it comes love, romance, and intimacy.While scientists have traditionally attributed our first impression of oneanother to brain functions, new evidence suggests that it’s more than the brainalone making the judgment. The heart plays a vital role in helping us to arriveat split-second decisions.A summary of recent IHM studies regarding intuition beautifully states theheart’s role in doing so. When it comes to our gut instincts, “At the center ofthis ability (intuition) is the human heart, which encompasses a degree ofintelligence whose sophistication and vastness we are continuing to understandand explore. We now know this intelligence may be cultivated to our advantage inmany ways.”22 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en22] As mentioned previously, it’sbecause heart intelligence bypasses the filters of the brain (the thoughts ofpast experiences, self-worth and self-esteem, and the like) that it can make thedecisions regarding our safety and well-being almost instantaneously.Todorov’s study found that we make a judgment in as little as a tenth of asecond when we encounter a new face. A number of additional studies have foundthat, just as our mothers told us in nonscientific terms, those firstimpressions are generally spot-on. Because we live in a society that hastraditionally discounted our intuition in the past, though, we often findourselves doing so when it comes to the most important choices of our lives.I have known friends, for example, who confided in me that the first time theyencountered the person they married, their first impression was to run, and runfast! Rather than listen to this intuitive advice, however, they rationalizedaway what they were feeling. By all outward appearances, there seemed to be nogood reason not to go forward with the relationship.In one instance, it was only after 12 years of marriage that one friend, a womanI worked with, admitted to herself that her first impression of her husband hadbeen correct. The man she’d married did not grow to respect her any more in thedecade-plus of her marriage than she felt he did when they first met. The keyhere is that she knew—her heart knew—almost instantly (in as little as one-tenthof a second) that the relationship wasn’t safe. And failing to consider what herintuition initially told her, she devoted 12 years of her life to arriving atthe same conclusion. In those years, she also had the experiences that empoweredher to think differently about herself and accept that she was worthy ofreceiving respect.It becomes clear that rather than think in terms of absolutes andblack-and-white decisions, we have the opportunity to be informed on differentlevels, by different experiences, when it comes to being in the world and ourdecisions in life. And it’s for this reason that it’s important to recognize thedifference between the kind of intuition described in this chapter and the roleof instinct in our lives—two different yet related experiences.This is the perfect opportunity to make a distinction between heart-basedintuition and what we know as our experience of instinct. Instinct is nature’sway of informing us in the present, based upon experiences of the past. And thepast that’s informing us may be our personal past or even include the collectivepast of our ancestors’ response to a particular situation that’s deeplyingrained into our psyche. Without a doubt, our instincts can powerfully serveus in some situations, such as the uneasy feeling we may have when we findourselves walking down a dark street at 1 A.M. in a city we’re not familiarwith. In this instance, our instinct is largely a mental process based upon theaccumulated experiences of humans walking in the same conditions for thousandsof years. In the past, dark streets have often meant trouble. When our instinctkicks in, our bodies respond with the rush of adrenaline that we feel in ourstomach—our gut response—preparing us for the possibility of fight or flight.I’m making this distinction here because our hearts’ intuition doesn’t work thesame way. Rather than informing us from a point in the past, it informs us ofwhat’s happening in the moment. Sometimes the intuitive response and the gutexperience can become confusing, especially when they’re both happening at thesame time. While the brain is telling us the dark street historically isn’tsafe, for example, the heart may be telling us that while this may be true, inthis moment, on this particular street, we are safe. Our job is to reconcile thetwo experiences.The best way I’ve discovered to do so for myself is to use the techniquesdescribed in the following section to access heart intelligence. Because it’sbased in the present time of the moment, it will generally cut through all theextraneous information to let me know if I’m in a situation that is safe or ifI’m not.My personal experience of heart intelligence is that it’s so fast, in fact, thatthe answer to any question I may ask generally appears before I’ve even finishedforming the question in my mind. Making the decision as to whether or not to goforward leading a group into Egypt in the late 1990s is a perfect example of thekind of decision that has no clear answer. It’s also a perfect example of a timewhen heart-wisdom was clear, direct and accurate.From Chaos to Certainty: A True-Life AccountIn November 1997, I was scheduled to take a tour group into Egypt. It was partof an annually scheduled pilgrimage I had led since my first group five yearsearlier, in 1992. To say that Egypt is an amazing destination is anunderstatement—it’s beyond amazing! To actually stand in front of the greatSphinx, a mystery I had studied in pictures as a child, and at the base of theGreat Pyramid, looking up at over 400 feet of the once-covered stones that arenow visible to the naked eye, is an experience of a lifetime. And I was undercontract to lead a multinational group into the Egyptian desert to haveprecisely these experiences, and many more.The national media began carrying the horrific images of November 17 in theevening news. Though the details were still emerging, the gist of the story wasclear. Armed terrorists had killed 58 foreign tourists and 4 Egyptians in aparticularly savage attack at the temple of Queen Hatshepsut, a populararchaeological site near the city of Luxor. My group was scheduled to leave forour tour the following week.What has now become known as the “Luxor Massacre” was devastating for thecountry of Egypt on a number of levels. The tourism industry was crushed.Hundreds of tour companies pulled out of the country, and the tours werecanceled. Airlines stopped flying to Cairo. Hotels were empty. And the pride ofthe Egyptian people was suffering a deep hurt. “This is not us,” my Egyptianfriends told me on the telephone. “Please don’t think of us in this way,” theypleaded.Immediately I began receiving phone calls regarding the planned tour. Family andfriends begged me not to go. The people signed up for the trip begged me not tocancel. The Egyptian authorities were concerned about the possibility of anotherattack. And the tour company was waiting for me to make a decision and do soquickly. The choices were clear: I could postpone the trip until another time,cancel it altogether, or go forward with it as planned. I felt pulled from allsides. Everyone I spoke with had an opinion, and they all made perfect sense.And just when I thought I had made the right choice, someone would call me andgive a good reason for another choice.Clearly, this was one of those times when the decision was not black-and-white;there was no right or wrong and no way of knowing what would happen over thecourse of the following days and weeks. There was only me, my instincts, myintuition, and my promise to honor my group and myself with the best choicepossible.Overwhelmed by the chaos of information and opinions, I turned off the telephoneand shut off the input from other people. From my home in the high desert ofnorthern New Mexico, I went for a long walk down a dirt road that I have visitedmany times in the past when I had to make a tough decision. And I applied in mylife precisely the technique that I shared previously in this chapter to get intouch with my deepest intuition regarding the tour.I stopped walking long enough to close my eyes, turn my attention inward, andfocus on my heart. It’s always helped me to touch the area of my heart with myfingertips during this process, to draw my awareness to the place of the touch.And as I began to slow my breathing, I felt a familiar sense of calm wash overmy body. I felt like myself, and the more I did, the more the horrible events ofthe day began to take on a new meaning. As I experienced the feelings ofgratitude, in this instance for the calm in my body and for the opportunity tomake such a powerful choice, I asked the question that no one else could answer.From a place of heart intelligence, I silently asked if it was a good time formy group to experience in the mysteries of Egypt.Through the years of using heart-based intelligence, I’ve learned that the heartworks best when it’s given brief phrases to respond to rather than multiplesentences. Our hearts don’t need a preface to the question we’re asking or anexplanation of the history behind the decision that’s at hand. The heart alreadyknows all of these things. For some people, the wisdom of the heart comes tothem as a feeling. For others, it can be a sense of knowing without question,while for still other people, the answer emerges as a familiar voice thatthey’ve known throughout their lifetimes. For me, it’s generally all of these. Ioften hear a subtle voice first, reinforced with a solid feeling of reassurance,safety, and certainty, followed by a sense of resolution and completeness. Andthat’s precisely what happened on that day in the high desert.Before I even finished asking the question, the answer was there for me:complete, direct, and clear. Immediately I felt—I knew—that our journey would beokay. It would be profound, deep, and healing. Most of all, I knew that byallowing intuition to guide us at each step of our journey, we would be safe.I want to be absolutely clear here about what I’m saying. My decision was basedupon the sensory impressions that I received as the result of a methodical,science-based process. It also happens to be a process that other peoplesometimes use in a less structured way, with similar results. The value ofaccessing heart intelligence is that it becomes possible to ask our questionswith no attachment to the outcome, through chante ista, the single eye of theheart. When I was clear about my decision, I personally called each personscheduled for the tour, and every one of them, regardless of age or nationality,asked me to go forward with the trip, but only if I felt it was safe to do so.I left for Egypt on schedule the next week with 40 amazing people to begin abeautiful adventure and a heartfelt journey that was full of surprises. Wearrived in a country that was mourning the loss of so many lives, and reelingfrom the impact of the attack. The president of Egypt at the time, HosniMubarak, was a friend of our guide and was so grateful that we came to hiscountry during such a difficult time that he wrote an official letter giving theDepartment of Antiquities permission to open rare archaeological sites to usthroughout our tour. Some of the sites, we later discovered, had not been openedsince they were first excavated in the late 1800s and have not been opened againsince our tour! Needless to say, the journey was amazing, and the bonding thathappened between our group and the Egyptian people forged friendships that lastto this very day.The beauty of heart-based wisdom is that we’re relieved of the burden ofsecond-guessing our choices. Based upon what I knew to be true at the time, Ifelt that my decision to lead the tour was a good one. I also believe that ifI’d canceled the trip based upon what I knew that day, that would have been agood decision as well. Having made the choice to go forward with the trip,however, via a decision informed by the wisdom of my heart, I’ve felt that Ihonored the people who trusted me to lead them, as well as myself, in making thebest one possible.I’m sharing this story as one example of how the tool of heart-brain coherencehas served me in the real world. And while this example was about a big decisioninvolving 40 people and a trip halfway around the world, I use precisely thesame technique, sometimes on a daily basis, to help me plan my day, temperrelationships, and honor the principles that are important to me when I’m testedin life. What I know with certainty is that we can never go wrong when we honorour hearts. I also know that if heart intelligence works for me, it will workfor you as well.EXERCISE: HOW TO ASK YOUR HEART A QUESTIONI want to take this opportunity to share a technique to tap into your heart’swisdom. And I want this exercise to be personal, so I will offer this section asif I’m speaking to you directly, as if you were sitting with me in my livingroom.Your heart’s intelligence is with you always. It’s constant. You can trust it.It’s important to acknowledge this, because it means that the wisdom of yourheart—the answers to the deepest and most mysterious questions of life that noone else can answer—already exists within you. Rather than something that needsto be built or created before it can be used, the link between your heart andthe place that holds your answers is already established. It’s been with yousince the time you were born and has never left you. It’s up to you as to whenyou choose to access that link as a “hotline” to the deepest truths of yourlife. It’s also up to you as to how you apply the wisdom of your heart in thereality of your everyday life.This is where discernment comes in. While your heart’s wisdom may be true foryou, it may not always be true for someone else. Our friends, children,siblings, life partners, and families all have their own heart wisdom. We can’tpossibly know with certainty what’s true for them. And we can’t always know howour well-intentioned sharing may affect the experience of another person. I’mmentioning this now as a point of consideration. When you find yourselfwondering if you should share what your heart intelligence has revealed to you,as a guideline I recommend asking yourself the following three questions: 1. What is my intention in sharing what I’ve discovered? 2. Who will benefit if I share this information? Or specifically, How will _______ benefit if I share this information? (Fill in the blank with the name of the person you’re considering sharing your revelation with.) 3. Who can be hurt by my sharing of this information?The key to using these questions is to be absolutely clear with yourself aboutthe very first question. To be conscious of your intention is the foundation ofyour personal responsibility. With your intention firmly in place, it becomeseasy to evaluate your answer to the next two questions to see if they honor yourstated intention. Whether they do or not, you will have the answer to yourquestion as to the appropriateness of sharing your deep knowing.With these ideas in mind, let’s apply the steps of coherence from the previoussection to access your heart’s intelligence. I recommend doing so in a placewhere it’s safe to close your eyes and direct your attention inward. (Youwouldn’t want to try this exercise while you’re driving or doing anything thatrequires your full and undivided attention!) The following steps will lead youdirectly to your heart’s deepest knowing.The steps for accessing your heart’s intelligence are as follows:Step 1: Focus Your Heart * Action: Allow your awareness to move from your mind to the area of your heart. * Result: This sends a signal to your heart that a shift has taken place—you are no longer engaged in the world around you and are now becoming aware of the world within you.Step 2: Slow Your Breathing * Action: Begin to breathe a little more slowly than usual, allowing five to six seconds for your inhale and exhale. * Result: This simple step sends a second signal to your body that you are safe and in a place that supports your process. Deep, slow breathing has long been known to stimulate a relaxation response of the nervous system (the parasympathetic response).Step 3: Feel a Rejuvenating Feeling * Action: To the best of your ability, feel a genuine sense of caring, appreciation, gratitude, or compassion for anything or anyone. * Result: The key to success here is for your feeling to be as sincere and heartfelt as possible. As described previously, it’s the quality of this feeling that fine-tunes and optimizes the coherence between your heart and your brain. While everyone is capable of this experience, it’s one of those processes that you may need to experiment with to find what works best for you.Step 4: Ask Your Heart Intelligence a Question * Action: The previous three steps create the harmony between your brain and your heart that enables you to tap into your heart’s wisdom. As you continue to breathe and hold the focus in your heart, this is the time to ask your question. * Result: Heart intelligence generally works best when the questions are brief and to the point. Remember, your heart doesn’t need a preface or the history of a situation before the question. Ask your question silently as a single concise sentence and then allow your heart’s wisdom to respond in a way that works for you.I’m often asked to interpret the symbols that show up in people’s dreams or themeaning of an experience that they’ve had in their lives. While it’s possiblefor me to offer an opinion, it’s just that. It’s my sense of what the image orexperience may mean in their lives. The truth is that I can’t possibly know whatothers’ dreams or experiences means for them. It’s also true that they can!The key is this: If you are empowered enough to have the experience, then youare empowered to know for yourself what your experience means.A mysterious dream is the perfect opportunity to apply heart wisdom to areal-world situation. From the heart-brain harmony established in the previousthree steps, simply ask the following kinds of questions, filling in the blankwith the names of the people, symbols, or identities of what you’re askingabout. These are example formats only. You can choose one that fits for you, orcreate your own using any of them as a template. * From the place of my heart’s deepest knowing, I ask to be shown the significance of _____ in my dream. * From the single eye of my heart that knows only my truth, I ask for the meaning of the _____ that I saw in my dream. * Please help me to understand the significance of _____ in my life.Step 5: Listen * Action: Become aware of how your body feels immediately as you are asking your question. Make a note of any sensations such as warmth, tingling, ringing of the ears, and emotions that may arise. Everyone learns and experiences uniquely. There is no correct or incorrect way of receiving your heart’s wisdom. The key here is to know what works best for you. * Result: For people who are already attuned to their bodies’ and their hearts’ intelligence, this step is the easiest part of the process. For those who may have less experience in listening to their bodies, this is an exercise in awareness.As I mentioned before, I tend to receive my heart’s wisdom as words while at thesame time I’m feeling the sensations in my body. Other people never hear thewords but experience a nonverbal communication only, such as warmth radiatingfrom their hearts or their gut. Sometimes people feel a wave of peace wash overthem as they receive the answer to their question. What’s important here is tolisten to your body and to learn how it communicates with you.I can honestly say that my heart’s wisdom has never led me to make a bad choice.And while I haven’t used this technique for every big decision I’ve made in mylife, I can also say with honesty that the only choices I’ve regretted are theones I made when I did not honor my heart’s wisdom.Now you have a step-by-step technique to help you feel empowered in the face oflife’s greatest challenges. While you probably can’t change the situations thatarrive at your doorstep, you can definitely change the way to feel and respondto those situations. If you haven’t already done so, you may discover that yourability to access the wisdom of your heart, on demand, becomes a good friend toyou and one of your greatest sources of strength in life. The consistency andaccuracy of heart-based solutions empower you to face any situation, meet withany person or force, with a confidence that’s hard to find when you feelhelpless, overwhelmed, powerless, and lost.Do We Already Know the Future?The example of my trip to Egypt illustrates a form of intuition that most of usare familiar with. It stems from a deep knowing of a relative truth—somethingthat is right for us in a given moment. There are other forms of intuition thatshow up in other ways. Sometimes these kinds of intuition are less aboutdecisions and moral choices in our personal lives and more about following animpulse that helps us in some way. The experience of precognition—the ability toknow or sense that something will happen before it actually does—is one of thoseways.There are times when precognition appears in our lives in a personal andconscious way. Gamblers that have the “knack” to choose winning lottery ticketsor who consistently find themselves with winning hands at high-stakes card gamesuse their ability for their personal gain. We’ve read stories of law-enforcementagents who have a sixth-sense “gut feeling” that something isn’t right with thehome they’ve just visited, follow their instinct, and end up saving a baby froma life-threatening domestic-violence situation. These are common examples ofconscious precognition. In the course of their lives the people in the previousexamples learned to trust their sense that something was about to happen in acertain way, and more often than not, it did.While our sense of future events often happens on a personal level, there arewell-documented instances of group or mass precognition of big events thataffect large numbers of people, as well. This kind of precognition is less aboutthe conscious knowledge of a specific event, and more about an unconscioussense, an impulse, to deviate from the typical routines of the day just becauseit feels like the thing to do. September 11, 2001, illustrates this kind ofsubconscious intuition in a powerful way.As tragic as the events of 9/11 were, and as many lives as there were lost onthat day, almost immediately it became clear that the day could have been evenworse. Had people scheduled their day to follow their typical routines, thenumber of deaths could have been much higher and the tragedy much greater.Immediately after the events of 9/11, story after story emerged of how peoplehad unexpectedly changed their plans that day in ways that saved their lives,and for reasons that they attributed to chance and sheer luck. Fathers withtheir offices high in the World Trade Center buildings suddenly chose to takethe day off and stay home with their families. People who had planned to fly onthe planes that were hijacked found themselves in unexpected traffic jams orextended conversations that made them miss their flights. And while it’s commonfor these things to happen occasionally, the large numbers of people who alteredtheir plans on September 11, and saved their own lives by doing so, tells usthat there is more than coincidence at work here.A number of celebrities are among those whose lives were saved on 9/11,seemingly by “chance.” Robert Redford, for example, was in New York City forbusiness meetings and scheduled to return to California on September 11 aboardthe Newark–Los Angeles flight that he took frequently, United Airlines flight93. His meetings ended unexpectedly early the day before, however, and he wasable to fly back to California on September 10. Had Redford taken his typicalflight, he would have been among the casualties of the hijacked flight 93 thatcrashed into a Pennsylvania field, killing all passengers and crew on board. Ina USA Today report about his experience of 9/11, Redford said, “We all have ouraccess to the horrors [of the attacks]. For some of us, it’s ‘There but for thegrace of God . . .’ I fall into that category.”23 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en23]Redford was not alone in his “lucky” change of plans on 9/11. Over 350 peoplewho had planned to take the four flights that were hijacked and destroyed thatday failed to make them for a number of reasons. Among the celebrities whoshared Redford’s good fortune and changed their travel plans that day wereactors Mark Wahlberg (scheduled to fly on American Airlines Flight 11 but flewto Boston the night before to be with friends),24 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en24]Jaime Pressly (canceled her flight on American Airlines flight 11 unexpectedlyat the last minute),25 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en25] and Edward James Olmos(scheduled to take American Airlines flight 11 to appear at the Latin GrammyAwards in Los Angeles but was tired and rescheduled for another flight)26[backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en26], as well as San Francisco mayor Willie Brown,comedian Seth MacFarlane, MTV reality star Julie Stoffer, and others.When we hear these kinds of stories, the number of people involved tells usthere’s something happening here that we owe it to ourselves to understand.Regardless of what we choose to call it, that so many people shifted theirtravel plans on such short notice for that day, or found that a shift of theirplans was beyond their control, suggests that they responded to an impulse—anunconscious cue—to do so. A research paper published by Cornell University mayprovide the first viable explanation for how it’s possible for us to sense suchoutcomes in a way that is beyond statistical chance. Not surprisingly, theCornell study may have created an even deeper mystery in the process.In a paper published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, socialpsychologist Darly Bem described a series of experiments that he performed toexplore the ability of some individuals to sense, or feel, the outcome of eventsbefore they happen.27 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en27] In other words, theexperiment was designed to explore the possibility of precognition. In one ofBem’s experiments, he used a computer that repeatedly showed the same image oftwo curtains on the screen side by side. Each time the curtains appeared, onewould have a picture behind it and the other would not, showing a blank wall.When the curtains appeared, the person tested was instructed to select the onethat felt as though it were covering an image.There are two pieces of information that are key to illustrate the significanceof this experiment: 1. The image behind the curtain was of couples engaged in consensual and nonviolent sexual acts. The test participants were told this, and also told that they had the opportunity to decline the test if they felt the images would be offensive to them. 2. No one, not even the scientists who designed the experiment, knew which curtain was hiding an image. The computer randomly chose the images each time the curtain appeared.In each test, the curtains appeared on the screen 36 times. Bem conducted theexperiments on over 1,000 participants, and the results were clear andconsistent. Because there were two possibilities for each choice, there was a 50percent chance that the participants would choose the curtain hiding the image.The success of the results was consistently beyond the chance statistics, with53.1 percent of the selections correctly choosing the curtain hiding an image.Somehow, the people tested correctly chose which curtain hid an erotic image toa degree statistically beyond luck. Through a process that the scientificcommunity continues to struggle with, studies like this show that theparticipants somehow knew—they sensed or felt in advance—the correct outcomebefore it was revealed on the computer screen.A similar study, conducted by IHM, invites us to go a step further and may giveus a clue as to why. The scientists at HeartMath designed a series ofexperiments to test for the possibility of what is called nonlocal intuition.Examples of this kind of intuition fall into broad categories of the kind ofexperiences described earlier in this chapter: parents connecting with theirchildren, or vice versa; knowing that an event that has yet to happen is aboutto occur, as in the previous study; and having someone call you the instantyou’re thinking about them (this also occurs sometimes when we find ourselveshumming a particular song in our minds, we turn on the radio, and the song isthe one that’s playing).The IHM experiments consisted of a setting where a number of parameters could bemeasured in the body of the person being tested, including skin conductivity,brain waves, and heart activity. The readings were made as the person beingtested would click a computer mouse to trigger the appearance of a random imageon the screen. This time, however, the images fell into two distinct categories:calming images of nature and stimulating images such as violence and war.The scientists already knew that our bodies respond differently to calmingimages, such as ocean waves gently breaking along a beautiful sandy shore, thanthey do while witnessing the aftermath of a violent battle. It’s because ofthese differences that these experiments are so intriguing. The tests revealedthat users’ bodies, including their hearts and brains, correctly anticipated thequality of the images they were about to see—before the images actuallyappeared. In other words, during the six seconds between the time the mouse wasclicked and the image was seen, the heart of the user was already experiencingthe image. The authors of the study are clear about the significance of thesestudies, stating, “Both the heart and the brain appear to receive and respond toinformation about a future emotional stimulus prior to actually experiencing thestimulus.”28 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en28]These studies shed new light and offer fresh insights into the power of ourhearts’ intuition when it comes to events that affect our future. The key hereis that the effect is more pronounced when the event has emotional significanceto us. In the Cornell study, the erotic images held an emotional charge for theparticipant undergoing the test. On September 11, the events that were alreadyin motion in the hearts and minds of those who carried them out held emotionalsignificance for them, as did the consequences of the aftermath for millions ofpeople around the world.In light of the 1987 confirmation of the energetic field that connects allthings,29 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch01-en29] the discovery that the human heartproduces and detects subtle fields of electrical and magnetic energy, and thediscovery of 40,000 or so specialized cells in the heart that detect just suchfields, it should come as no surprise to us that we can sense in the field the“signature” of events that exist there. Whether it’s an erotic image in thelaboratory, the mass destruction of 9/11, or the well-being of our children inanother room or on the other side of the world, the evidence is clear: we arepart of the world, and our ability to sense the world that we’re part of is anatural part of our being. Our willingness to embrace and develop this abilitycan enrich our lives and our relationships in ways that may have soundedimpossible only a generation ago.Living from Your Heart: The Next Step of EvolutionThere is a saying among certain indigenous and ancient mystery traditions whenit comes to the way we live our lives, and how we come to terms with life’sexperiences. Though the traditions are different from one another, they arebound together by the theme of a common thread of wisdom: In order for us tocome full circle and embrace our personal power in life, we must first embarkupon a journey of personal discovery. And while the journey may lead us awayfrom what’s been familiar in the past, and may take our entire lifetime tocomplete, the distance of our trip is a short one. It only covers about 18inches.Whether we’re tall or short, and regardless of the race or nationality we callour heritage, for all of us the average distance from the center of our brainsto the middle of our hearts is the same: 18 inches. But the short distance canbe deceptive. Depending on the beliefs of our families, our communities, ourreligions, and what happens in our life experiences, it can take months, years,or a lifetime to learn how to make the shift from the logical thinking of themind to the intuitive wisdom of the heart, and when it’s appropriate to do so.The discovery of the “little brain” in the heart, however, and the benefits itaffords us tells us that to make such a shift is certainly worth the effort.It’s the journey that takes us out of the either-or polarity thinking of thebrain, and into the intuitive knowing of our heart. And while the ability to doso would be empowering for us at any time, it is especially so now, in ourlifetime of converging extremes.As you will find detailed throughout this book, it’s clear that the first yearsof the 21st century—the present—are no ordinary time in the history of oursocieties, our nations, and our world. We’re living a time of acceleratedchange—cycles of climate, conflict, and economic shifts that are bearing downupon us in a way that no generation in recorded history has ever faced.We no longer live in the isolated countries that formed the foundation of oursociety during the 19th and 20th centuries. We no longer live in nations withisolated economies, isolated technologies, isolated energy grids, and isolateddefense and communications systems. The way we think about money and financialsecurity now isn’t the same as how our grandparents thought about these things.The role that religion and spirituality has played in our lives is taking on newmeaning as we try to apply 2,500-year-old ideas to a 21st-century world. Thevery principles that have helped us feel secure in our communities and homes arechanging. Facts like these lead us to one of the most crucial yet leastunderstood realizations of our era: we’re living a time of many, many extremes,and they’re all converging upon us at once in this lifetime, today, now. Thesefacts have led to the certainty of where we find ourselves right now, in thisvery moment: we’re living with a new set of rules for our lives.While I’ve done my best to detail the extremes that are changing the way youlive, work, and think, and to do so in a clear and truthful way in Chapter 4[chapter04.xhtml], I’m stating the fact of the extremes here to provide thebackground for why you need the heart-based wisdom, and the resilience that itbrings, in your life now.Knowing that we’re living in a time of extremes tells us that we can expect bigchanges in our lives. Whether it’s social upheaval, climate change, a globaleconomy buckling under the burden of record debt, or a growing populationcompeting for shrinking supplies of water and other resources, if we’re honestwith ourselves, we know that these crises aren’t temporary. In all likelihood,they’re with us for our lifetime and probably our children’s as well.We’ve all heard the adage that the only constant in life is change. We’ve alsoheard that change can be one of the most stressful experiences we face in life.And it’s that stress of change that biologists tell us is the trigger for newways of thinking and living—the evolutionary transformation that makes us betterpeople, creates stronger families and communities, and ultimately promises oursurvival as a species. The formula is clear: the bigger the shift, the greaterthe transformation. It’s because so many of the old ways of thinking are nolonger enough to meet the needs of our transforming world that the discoveriesin this chapter are so vital. They hold the keys to one of the most profoundevolutionary leaps possible. We’re living the shift from creating our livesbased upon the way our minds see the world to a new way of thinking and livingbased upon the way our hearts and minds sense the world.What’s important here is that whatever change life brings to your doorstep, it’sonly a problem if you don’t know how to embrace it in a healthy way. And that’sprecisely what this book is all about. As you learn to merge the senses of yourheart and the logic of your brain into a single potent system, you empoweryourself to beneficially manage change in your life. In doing so, you giveyourself the evolutionary edge that may have been lost in the recent past whenearly scientists began to separate the power of the heart and brain.I’ve always felt that the better we know ourselves, the better equipped we areto embrace whatever comes our way. And what better way to know ourselves than totap the essence of our deepest intuitive wisdom? With these ideas in mind, thefollowing chapters teach us the power of resilience from the heart—how to createit for ourselves, our families, and our communities, and how we can learn toapply it in our everyday lives.img [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO [contents.xhtml#toc_4]RESILIENCE FROM THE HEART: [contents.xhtml#toc_4]The Power to Thrive in Life’s Extremes [contents.xhtml#toc_4]img [images/common1.jpg]“Life doesn’t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient.”— STEVE MARABOLI, AMERICAN MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER AND AUTHOROn September 11, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America,Time magazine created a special edition dedicated to honoring the way in whichindividuals, families, and the nation hard-hit by the tragedy have been able tocarry on with life and living. Its title says it all: “Beyond 9/11: Portraits ofResilience.” If there was ever a question as to the role that resilience hasplayed in America’s recovery, the first sentence of the special edition put itto rest, calling resilience the theme of the nation in the 21st century.1[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en1] Through intimate stories shared by citizens andleaders alike, Time sought to “define what it means to meet adversity, and thenovercome it.”2 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en2]While we often hear about the resilience that allows us to move beyond thehardships of life, could there be more to the word than that? Is there a form ofresilience that can be cultivated with a bigger picture in mind? Is it possibleto live each day in a resilient frame of mind that softens the impact ofdramatic change, rather than trying to achieve resilience after the fact? Theanswer to this question is a resounding yes! It’s the reason why I’ve writtenthis chapter.Cultivating resilience is part of a trend that’s gaining a foothold inindividuals, families and communities throughout the world. In choosing the pathof resilience within ourselves, our families and communities, we can createpositive turning points in our time of extremes. In addition to minimizing thehardships that can come with unexpected change, many people have discovered thatthe building blocks of personal resilience are a great way to live as well, andone that makes sense in light of today’s world.It’s possible for individuals, families, and communities to create turningpoints of resilience that minimize the impact of abrupt change and shorten thetime it takes to recover when hardship does occur.Resilience: What Does It Mean?Resilience means different things to different people, and its meaning varies byculture, age, and even by the way the word is used. The requirements forresilience in the daily routines of a couple just starting their life together,for example, are very different from those for partners who have been marriedfor 50 years. For teenagers in the Western world, who are dependent upon theirparents for the basics of everyday life, resilience means something verydifferent than it does in a tribal setting, where young people often form theirown communities to care for themselves and others of a similar age. Theprinciples that create resilience under battlefield conditions are tailored to avery different set of needs from those identified by organizations like the PostCarbon Institute, which explore what it takes to live sustainably in the eraafter peak oil. Clearly, resilience is one of the qualities in life that we mustadapt to our specific circumstances.While much of the research on this topic is offered with respect to wholecommunities and society, the place where resilience begins is with us. At thevery core, this conversation is all about people. Our world of extremes isforcing us to think and live differently to meet our needs successfully. In somecases, such as with downsized industries and shrinking job markets, it’s leavingus little choice other than to do so.So let’s begin at the beginning. What does it take to create, develop, andsustain a resilient lifestyle—to live in a resilient way?In the modern world, resilience is often used to describe someone’s ability torecover from an unexpected change in life, such as a devastating setback or atraumatic loss. “The couple has shown tremendous resilience in healing from theloss of their son in the war,” for example, is a comment that, unfortunately,has become far too common. “The resilience that my friend has shown after hiswife left the marriage is an inspiration for us all” illustrates another way weoften hear the term used today. In recent years, it’s become customary to hear“resilience” mentioned when describing the attitude and physical fortitude ofentire communities, even nations, as they recover from the devastation ofhurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks.Resilience is not limited only to human experiences, however. It can be appliedto any system, living or not, where dynamic change is involved. Over a period ofmillennia, the complex ecosystems of the Amazon rain forests, for example,developed resilience in adapting to big shifts in Earth’s climate. Today’ssophisticated computer programs are resilient: they can detect and fix softwareglitches within themselves that keep them from doing what they were designed todo. From the immune system that keeps us healthy and the nervous system thatkeeps us safe, to the way we produce vital hormones and generate new blood cellsthat keep us alive, our bodies have multiple and interconnected systems that wedepend upon, and each one has its own form of resilience.While the American Psychological Association defines resilience as “the processof adapting well in the face of adversity” and “‘bouncing back’ from difficultexperiences,”3 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en3] the Stockholm Resilience Centreidentifies resilience as the “capacity of a system to continually change andadapt yet remain within critical thresholds.”4 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en4]It’s the theme reflected in this second definition that best illustrates ourexpanded view of resilience. We’re talking about a way of thinking and livingthat gives us the flexibility to change and adapt to new conditions. This is thekey to transformation in our time of extremes.As universal as the experience of resilience is, interestingly I’ve found thatmany cultures simply have no word in their language that actually reflects whatit means. The only way that someone speaking in one of these languages can sharethe idea of resilience is to string together a number of unrelated words intheir native tongue that, when considered together, will approximate what thesingle word means in English. During a book tour through central Europe, forexample, I was describing the principles that would become the core ofResilience from the Heart when I discovered how such a disparity in words canactually play out in the real world.During my onstage presentation, I was working with a translator usingconsecutive translation: meaning, I would speak, then he would translate, then Iwould speak, and so on (as compared to a simultaneous translator where thetranslator is in another part of the room speaking directly through the headsetsof those in the audience listening). Suddenly, the entire presentation came to agrinding halt when my translator found himself in a lively conversation not withme, but with members of the audience. Surprisingly, they were debating the wayhe had just translated the word resilience.While I had assumed that there would be an equivalent word for my ideas in everylanguage, it was then that I discovered this is not the case. Just the wayEnglish speakers have to put together the separate words life and force toapproximate the Hindu word prana, there was no single word for resilience in thelanguage my interpreter was using. I also learned that it’s good to meet withthe translators before presentations to iron out such potential wrinkles.While the idea of resilience and what it means may vary for people of differentage-groups and cultures, the way it shows up in life does not. We find theelements of resilience in two places: * The way we think * The way we liveThrough one, or a combination, of these two expressions, some form of resilienceis found in every facet of our experience. From our emotional ability to copewith the stress of big change, to the physical ability of our bodies to resistillness and disease, and the ability of our minds to resolve the psychologicalimpacts of trauma and loss, many forms of resilience clearly exist. It’s alsoclear that they play a big part in our lives each and every day. For thepurposes of this book, I will address two general forms: the personal resiliencethat will be explored in this chapter, and the community resilience that will becovered in the next one.Our ideas of resilience are reflected in the way we think and the way we live.Personal ResilienceEven with decades of research and thousands of studies published in hundreds ofprofessional journals, there’s still no single theory of resilience. There are,however, facets of resilience that seem to fall into general categories that wecan use as a springboard for our exploration. Professional organizations havetaken the myriad studies of different kinds of resilience and adapted them tothe specific needs of their communities. We can find specialists trained to helpus with everything from physical resilience in endurance sports, for instance,to psychological resilience in business or emotional resilience in difficultrelationships. The common denominator in all of these communities is trauma, andwe don’t have to look very far to find sources of this in our lives.With cable television programs blaring 24/7 news cycles filled with gruesomedetails of war, warnings of threats to the security of our homes and schools,bloody incidents of neighborhood shootings, and an alarming increase in thenumber of teen suicides linked to ridicule and bullying perpetrated throughsocial media, our society is routinely filled with trauma. Each traumaticincident creates the need to heal from the damage it leaves in our lives,families, and communities. Although our social traumas stem from differentsources, the characteristics that help us first to cope with the experiences,and then to find the resilience needed to transform ourselves beyond theexperiences, are remarkably similar.There are a number of excellent resources available to guide us in this process.One that I’ve found to be especially useful in real-world situations is theNational Victim Assistance Academy (NVAA). Under the auspices of the Office forVictims of Crime Training and Technical Assistance Center, this academy is afederal program designed to support professional service providers who assistpeople traumatized by crime. The training programs they’ve developed helpvictims transcend hurtful experiences through specific steps that create skillsof resilience.5 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en5]One of the reasons I like the NVAA framework so much is that it addresses abroad landscape of physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, from the way wepersonally cope in stressful conditions to the way we deal with other people intimes of stress. A representative summary of the key factors for resilience theNVAA has developed includes: * Knowledge of yourself * A personal sense of hope * The ability to cope in a healthy way * Strong interpersonal relationships * Finding a personal meaning in lifeLet’s explore each of these factors a little more deeply to get a better idea ofwhy these five characteristics are so important and how they fit into our lives.A framework for personal resilience includes qualities such as: self-knowledge,a sense of hope, healthy coping skills, strong relationships, and a sense ofmeaning in life.Knowledge of YourselfLocated within the innermost chamber of the ancient Luxor Temple in Egypt, aplace called the Holy of Holies, there’s an inscription that reminds those whopass through the doors of the secret hidden within their own existence. Thephrase “Man, know thyself” is followed up with the benefit that comes from doingso. The full text reads: “Man, know thyself and thou shalt know the gods.”Those first three words, embedded within many of the ancient Egyptian texts, arethe same ones found at the entrance to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi in Greece.In Delphi, however, the words are simplified to read: “Know thyself.” From thewisdom traditions of ancient Egypt and Greece to the deepest mysteries of theworld’s most cherished spiritual practices, there is nearly universal agreementthat our ability to meet life’s challenges hinges upon how well we knowourselves. This is where identifying the false assumptions of the past (and thenew discoveries that tell us they’re false) becomes especially useful.For nearly three centuries, the accepted science of our world has told us thatwe’re separate from ourselves and one another, and that the law of the land isbased upon competition and struggle. From the time we’re young, many of us haveheard these ideas boiled down to the simple admonition that we live in adog-eat-dog world. This often-subconscious belief remains at the very core ofour most difficult relationships, those in which we still believe we muststruggle to be successful. This is where the new discoveries that help us answerthe question Who am I? also give us the reasons to change our thinking and ourbeliefs.From the discovery of quantum entanglement, which confirms just how deeply we’reconnected to one another and our world, to the fact that cooperation rather thancompetition is the fundamental rule of nature, the more we find out aboutourselves, the better equipped we are to deal effectively with the changes inthe world. When we replace the false assumptions of separation with the deepesttruths of our connection and the role of cooperation in our lives, ourself-knowledge gives us the reasons to think more holistically and to act withgreater certainty when it comes to the choices we make in our lives.A Personal Sense of HopeWhen we hear heartfelt and inspiring stories of people who have survivedseemingly un-survivable situations, two of the first questions usually beingdirected to them are, “How did you do it? What kept you from simply giving up?”It’s worth exploring the way these two questions are answered, because of thesimilarity of the emotional impact. As different as specific traumaticsituations may appear from one another, whether stemming from crimes or naturaldisasters, almost universally those who survive and recover in a healthy way saythat they were sustained by their sense of optimism and hope.I remember seeing the television footage of the American hostages being takenfrom the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979, and the effect these images had on myco-workers and me. At the beginning, we had shared the sense, reflected by manypeople in the world, that the situation would be resolved quickly. As the daysand weeks of their captivity dragged on, however, it became obvious that therewould be no quick solution, or relief, for those being held prisoner.Even then, however, I don’t think anyone—myself, my co-workers, and my circle offriends or the leaders of the nations involved included—had any idea that thesituation that would become known as the “Iran hostage crisis” would last aslong as it did: a total of 444 days. During the interviews that followed thefreeing of the captives, we began to gain insights into what sustained them forover a year after their ordeal began. A number of the former hostages citedtheir spirituality and love for their families, both of which gave them hope, askeys to their survival. In a 2012 interview, retired Air Force colonel TomSchaefer, one of the 52 American hostages, commented, “My bottom line was thatmy faith in God and belief in the power of prayer got me through it all.”6[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en6]On December 4, 1991, another hostage situation came to a close, as TerryAnderson was released from his captivity at the hands of Hezbollah, a politicalparty in Lebanon, which had begun nearly seven years earlier. Anderson, who wasthe bureau chief for the Associated Press in Beirut at the time he was taken,presently has the dubious distinction of being the longest-held Americanpolitical captive in the Middle East to date. His ordeal of solitude, fear, andresilience lasted for a total of 2,454 days—just under seven years! In aninterview following his release, Anderson attributed his strength and goodhealth to his optimism and a sense of hope. The optimism was that he alwaysbelieved his captors would spare his life. The hope of the freedom that awaitedhim when his situation was resolved was the key, he said, to the discipline oftaking his captivity hour by hour, an exercise that he called mentally “doingtime.”7 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en7]Hope is more than an unfounded belief or the powerless wish of a better time.Hope is essential for our well-being. In 1991, psychologist Charles R. Snyder,Ph.D., and his colleagues developed the scientific approach to studying theoften-undervalued role of hope in our lives, known as hope theory.8[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en8]Clarifying the importance of our experiences of hope, cognitive psychologistScott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D., says, “Having goals is not enough. . . . Hope allowspeople to approach problems with a mindset and strategy-set suitable to success,thereby increasing the chances they will actually accomplish their goals.”9[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en9] It’s clear that science is catching up with whatpeople in desperate situations have known intuitively for centuries: our senseof hope gives us the reason to expect a better tomorrow.The Ability to Cope in a Healthy WayFrom the late 1970s through the early ’90s, I worked in a series of scientificand technical environments during three distinct periods of crisis: the energycrisis of the 1970s, the atomic-weapons crisis of the Cold War, and thedata-compatibility crisis between computer platforms during the late 1980s andearly ’90s. It was during this part of my life that I had the opportunity towitness firsthand how individuals and groups respond to the stress created bythe responsibility of their jobs. From the fuel systems for NASA’s Space ShuttleProgram to the ability of military medical teams in the field to communicatewith floating hospital ships hundreds of miles away, in each situation I wasinvolved with, people’s lives depended upon the products and services that thecompanies I represented provided.In each situation and each industry, time and again, I heard my fellow workerssay that they had problems coping with the stress of the demands that were beingplaced upon them. Clearly, beyond the development of the services that we werecontracted to deliver, stress was the greatest challenge that each of us facedevery day of our careers. On the projects that I supervised, a big part of myresponsibility was finding ways to keep my teams healthy and together longenough to complete our assignments.The word that my teams used to describe their experience was overwhelmed. Theyfelt overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project, overwhelmed by how much neededto be done, and overwhelmed by their own doubts regarding their abilities todeliver. We’ve all felt similarly overwhelmed at some point in our lives, and Idon’t want to create the impression that there’s anything wrong with the feelingitself. If we can accept that our sense of being overwhelmed, by anything inlife, is an indicator of something that needs our attention, the experienceitself can be viewed as a positive one that leads to a healthy outcome.Without such a perspective, however, the people on my teams were responding totheir experience in ways that were not only unhealthy, but that were actuallypreventing them from doing their jobs. I began to notice team members takingmore sick days, feeling depressed during the time they were in the office, anddeveloping habits of distraction, such as compulsive eating and the increaseduse of tobacco. Not surprisingly, as we discovered in Chapter 1[chapter01.xhtml], these are among the indicators of unhealthy coping responsesdescribed by organizations such as the Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes ofHealth, and others in their research regarding stress management.The following is a composite list of unhealthy coping skills adapted from across section of stress-response studies. The symptoms themselves areself-explanatory. And while it’s likely that we’ve all experienced each of thesesymptoms occasionally in the past with no problem, it’s when multiple symptomsbecome chronic that they’re probably telling us our stress has become a concern.A Partial List of Indicators of Unhealthy Coping Skills * Problems getting to sleep, staying asleep, and sleeping at the right time of day or night * Pain; headaches; and the unconscious clenching of fists, the biting of lips, or tightness in the neck and shoulders * Turning to food when we’re not hungry or eating beyond fullness when we are hungry * Feeling depressed, lethargic, and emotionally numb * Crying uncontrollably at unexpected times for no apparent reason * Inordinate responses of anger and negativity * Using alcohol, smoking, and substance abuse to calm downOne of the keys to the success of the team members I worked with was to shifttheir perspective regarding the project itself and their role in it. They foundthat by breaking the big picture of their responsibilities down into smaller andmore manageable pieces, and by doing their homework and preparing everythingthat they needed in order to accomplish each of these pieces in advance, theycould focus on each job that landed on their desk with much less stress.Not surprisingly, the steps I’m describing are also among the healthy copingmechanisms identified by experts. The following is a representative list ofhealthy coping skills. Greater detail describing how to implement these skillsinto your life is available at the websites of groups such as the Mayo Clinic,National Institutes of Health, the Institute of HeartMath, and others (see theResources section at the back of the book).A Partial List of Healthy Coping Strategies * Make sure you’re healthy. Sometimes a problem in the body can show up during the vulnerability created by stressful conditions. * Scale back on your commitments. Learn to say no to offers of more responsibility than you can reasonably handle. Learn to break large jobs into smaller tasks with clear milestones to accomplish. Delegate elements of your tasks in ways that are honoring and empowering to your co-workers, friends, or family members. * Exercise on a regular basis. The definition of exercise is changing. Studies have shown that only 10–15 minutes a day of constant movement (flow yoga, resistance training, or swimming, for example) relieves the body of circulating stress hormones without kicking up more stress hormones and the type of fat-storing hormones triggered by longer endurance exercises that “trick” the body into thinking it’s in a survival situation. * Do your homework and prepare. When we’re prepared for our day, we experience less stress over whatever it has in store for us. Avoid stressful situations by preparing for meetings and trips, scheduling your time better, and setting realistic goals. * Make sleep a priority in your life. Your body will interpret a lack of sleep as a source of stress. As with any stressful situation, the effects of not getting enough sleep can show up as anxiety reactions, a gain in weight, and periods of crying and anger at unexpected times. * Connect with other people. Either professionally, casually, or in combination, social connections offer an outlet to share frustrations, a sounding board for insights and solutions, and the opportunity for other people to help you in ways that they enjoy and are good at. * Learn to relieve your stress. There are probably as many ways to relieve stress as there are people who experience it. While yoga, meditation, and massage work for some, taking a walk in nature or having a creative outlet, such as drawing, painting, and making music, works better for others. The key here is to experiment, discover what works for you, and then make this practice a priority in your life. * Professional help. Some people are good at finding solutions to stress on their own. Others are more comfortable delving into such intimate experiences with professional guidance. If this is your choice, I recommend an objective and qualified counselor, therapist, or life coach with training in anxiety and stress management.Clearly, our ability to meet the stress of life’s challenges by doing thingsthat bring us a sense of well-being is the key to our health and happiness.While our challenges may stem from different sources, the preceding skills applyto any life stressors, because they all depend upon our ability to cope.Strong Interpersonal RelationshipsIt’s been said that everyone needs a friend. Whether or not we call itfriendship, science shows us beyond a doubt that: (1) we need human connectionsin our lives, and (2) having them is really good for us. As creative beings, weall find ways to have our needs met in one way or another. When it comes tointerpersonal relationships, some people are more comfortable interacting inlarge communities, clubs, and organizations, while others are fulfilled bymaintaining a relatively small, intimate group of personal friends. Some peoplehave found that it works to have both. In whatever way we connect and relate,it’s a good thing that we do. It’s good for our health, as well as for ourability to cope with stressful situations.In the previous example of my co-workers under stress, for example, it was thecamaraderie they experienced through their interpersonal relationships on thejob (which sometimes deepened into friendships) that provided them the emotionalsupport for coping with the stress of doing the projects. Sometimes just beingable to walk over to the desk of a co-worker to ask for a fresh set of eyes on aproblem is all that it takes to relieve the stress of working with an issue thatseems unsolvable.In addition to the benefits of having strong personal relationships in theworkplace, studies have shown that they’re good for us in life. They’re good forour immune systems, for our communication skills, for our self-esteem, and evenfor our life expectancy. While such benefits make sense intuitively, scientificstudies are now confirming factually what we’ve always sensed about friendship,love, and well-being.In a 2011 report published by the BC (British Columbia) Council for Families,entitled “Healthy Relationships: Their Influence on Physical Health,” resultsfrom a number of studies from a number of disciplines were pulled together toillustrate the impact of the relationships in our lives.10[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en10] In summary: * People in relationships provide information, advice, services, and new social contacts to one another, enabling them to discover local and social services and know how to use them more effectively. * Relationships provide people with a caring environment. * Relationships provide a group identity. * Relationships provide a buffer to stress. * Relationships provide a purpose for living a healthy lifestyle.Professional studies, such as the ones cited by this report, and the directsharing from trauma survivors both show that stable and well-functioningrelationships help us develop a larger meaning and purpose in our lives. When wehave this sense of purpose, we seem to be more motivated to protect ourselvesagainst disease, illness, or injury.Finding a Personal Meaning in Everyday LifeOne of the greatest factors contributing to resilience in life, yet possibly theleast talked about, is the personal meaning that we give to our own existence.This is one of those places where the lines drawn between science, spirituality,religion, and the real world can become a bit fuzzy. Knowing that there can beno definitive answer to “What is the meaning of life?” each of us is left todevelop our own sense of what the world is all about and how we fit into it andwhere we belong.There are some people who believe we must know the technical stuff, includinghow life began, to find meaning in each day. The problem in this thinking ariseswith the sources of the knowledge themselves: science, religion, and directexperience. In the modern world, many people believe these are mutuallyexclusive ways of knowing. In other words, they feel we must choose only oneway, such as science or religion. Although it’s not such a popular notion, inreality all three ways of knowing can contribute powerfully to helping us findpersonal meaning in the bigger picture of life. Science, for example, canobjectively confirm the facts that our spiritual teachings and directexperiences are leading us to believe are true.In whatever way we find our answers, it’s the significance we find in eachmoment of each day of our lives that gives meaning to everything else. It’s onlywhen we feel that we’re part of something bigger than ourselves, and canidentify where we fit and how we contribute to this “bigger something,” that ourexistence in the world and life make sense. In the absence of such meaning, theevents of life, including our family relationships, our loves, our jobs,careers, joys, disappointments, failures, and successes, all appear random anddisconnected from one another and from us. As a friend of mine stated so clearlyto me during a conversation about this very topic, “In a life without meaning,what would be the point?”Whatever we believe is the meaning of our existence, Eleanor Roosevelt may havebest summed up the healthy way to think about such things on a daily basis: “. .. the purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to theutmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richerexperience.”11 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en11]The Sixth Element of ResilienceIn addition to the five characteristics of personal resilience previouslyidentified in this chapter—self-knowledge, a sense of hope, healthy copingskills, strong interpersonal relationships, and the personal meaning that wefind in life—there’s a sixth element to creating resilience that’s typically notincluded in the formal studies. Interestingly, however, it’s this single elementthat we find at the core of the most respected and ancient wisdom traditions.It’s also the window to the inner realm of our experience that leading-edgescientists now regard as the next great frontier in self-care. The sixth factorof personal resilience is the shift that we can create in our emotions toprepare our bodies for life’s extremes in a healthy way. This avenue ofresilience lives in the heart.The Language of the HeartIn our modern world of information overload, speed dating, multiple consecutivedouble cappuccinos, and the often-heard sense that life is “speeding up,” it’sinevitable that our bodies can feel that we’re in a constant state ofnever-ending stress. For our distant ancestors, this response would save themfrom an angry bear that had camped out in their cave, for example. When theyfelt that the threat was gone, their emotions shifted and the elevated levels ofthe stress hormones returned to the normal levels of everyday life.The good news is that when such high levels of stress chemicals are present, wecan become superhumans. We’ve all heard stories of a 98-pound woman successfullytilting a full-size automobile off the ground long enough to save her childpinned beneath—and doing so without first considering if such a feat was evenpossible. In such cases, the fight-or-flight response is activated on behalf ofthe child, who would have died without intervention. In these instances, theextra-human strength of the mother is attributed to the surge of stress hormonespouring into the body from her feelings of do or die—feelings that originate inher heart.The flip side of the good news is that while the benefits can be helpful duringa short period of time, the stress that triggers the surge effectively shutsdown the release of other chemicals that support important functions in ourbodies. The release of vital chemicals that support growth, immunity, andanti-aging is dramatically reduced during times of fight or flight. In otherwords, the body can be in only one mode or the other: fight/flight mode orhealing/growth mode.12 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en12] The key here is that thestress response is designed to be temporary and brief. Clearly, we were nevermeant to live day in and day out with constant stress as a way of life. Yet thisis precisely the situation that many of us find ourselves experiencing today.People who cannot find a release from this kind of stress find themselves insustained fight-or-flight mode, with all of the consequences that come with theterritory. A quick look around an office or a classroom, or even a glance at ourfamily members over Sunday dinner, confirms what the data suggests. It’s notsurprising to find that people with the greatest levels of sustained stress arealso in the poorest health.The rise in U.S. statistics for stress-related conditions, including heartdisease and stroke, eating disorders, immune deficiencies, and some cancers, isless of a surprise when we take into account the relentless stress that manypeople experience in their daily lives. As mentioned in Chapter 1[chapter01.xhtml], the stress from negative emotions increases the levels ofstress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline in our bloodstreams, whichprepare us for a quick and powerful reaction to whatever is causing us stress.The good news is that the same mechanism that creates and sustains our stressresponses, often on a subconscious level, can also be regulated to help usrelieve the stress in a healthy way—even when the world is in chaos. And we cando so quickly and intentionally.Just the way our hearts send our brains the signals of chaos when we feelnegative emotions, positive emotions send another kind of signal to our brainsthat is more regular, more rhythmic, and more orderly. In the presence ofpositive emotions, such as appreciation, gratitude, compassion, and caring, thebrain releases a very different kind of chemistry into the body. When we feel asense of well-being, the level of stress hormones in our bodies decreases, whilethe life-affirming chemistry of a powerful immune system with anti-agingproperties increases. The shift between the stress response and a feeling ofwell-being can happen quickly, as seen in Figure 2.1.img [images/pg71.jpg]Figure 2.1. A comparison of the signals between the heart and the brain in twoextremes of emotion: the “negative” emotion of frustration and the “positive”emotion of appreciation. Source: The Institute of HeartMath.Studies documented by the Institute of HeartMath have shown that cortisol levelscan decrease as much as 23 percent, and levels of DHEA, a life-affirmingprecursor to other vital hormones in the body, can increase 100 percent if wespend as little as three minutes using focused techniques designed to producesuch responses.13 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en13] The reason why I’m describingthese phenomena in this part of the book is because the techniques that arefound to have such benefits upon our health are the same ones that create theresilience in our hearts. This is the key to personal resilience in life.The quality of our emotions determines the instructions our hearts send to ourbrains.A Deeper Resilience from WithinThe human nervous system is an awe-inspiring and intricate network of over 45miles of living “wires” (nerves) that carry the effects of our heart/brainconversation to every other part of the body. While scientists have known forquite some time how the messages from the brain travel throughout the body, itwas only in the last years of the 20th century that new discoveries revealedprecisely where the signals originate. Not surprisingly, the role of the heartis central.Now that we understand what the conversation between our hearts and our brainscan accomplish, let’s look at the mechanisms that make this conversationpossible and how to change the “dialogue” in healthy ways. It all begins withthe resilience that we create within the heart itself. One of the ways ofdetermining our level of resilience is to measure the peaks and valleys of ourheart rhythms.While you’re likely generally familiar with the printout of your heart’sactivity during a routine EKG (now commonly known as an ECG orelectrocardiogram) during a physical examination, you may not be fully aware ofeverything that the graph is telling you. The ECG measures the electrical outputof the heart. It’s completely passive and does not send any electricalinformation into your body. Rather, it’s measuring the electrical signalscreated by your heart and how those signals are sent throughout your body. Askillful reading of these signals can reveal a tremendous amount of informationranging from the overall condition of the heart itself, to the health of yournervous system beyond the heart and even subtle conditions that may lead toproblems at a later time. While the interpretation of heart rhythms could fillan entire book and represents a lifetime of study, I’m describing it here for aspecific reason. There’s an aspect of the heart that’s the key to creatingresilience.When looking at the sample ECG in Figure 2.2, even to the untrained eye it’sclear that there are repeating patterns of large spikes created by eachheartbeat. What’s important to our discussion is that the distance from the topof one large spike (called an R wave) to the next is not always the same; itvaries from beat to beat. While it may look like the space from one peak to thenext is identical, when we measure the intervals we find that the distancesbetween them change. And it’s a good thing they do, because this is where ourresilience in life begins.The more the time changes between beats, the greater the resilience we have tolife and to changes in our world. Because we’re measuring the variable distancesbetween heartbeats, the measurement is called just what we’d expect: heart-ratevariability (HRV). HRV is measured in very small units of time calledmilliseconds, and the difference between one heartbeat and the next may be amatter of only a fraction of a second. In Figure 2.2, for example, thedifference in time between R wave 2 and R wave 3, compared to the time between Rwave 3 and R wave 4, is only 67 milliseconds. While this is a small amount,what’s important is that there is a difference.img [images/pg74.jpg]Figure 2.2. A portion of a typical ECG showing the cyclic peaks and dips of atypical heartbeat. The large peaks indicated by the arrows are the R waves of asingle heartbeat. The distance from the peak of one R wave to the next changesfrom beat to beat. It’s this difference that gives us our heart-ratevariability. Source: Dreamstime: © Z_i_b_i.Early in life, we have a high level of HRV. Now that we understand the purposeof HRV, it makes perfect sense that we would. When we are young children,discovering and adapting to our environment, our bodies need a way to adjust towhat we find—and to do so quickly. The first time our fingers discover what hotwater from the kitchen faucet is all about, for example, or when we find outthat not all dogs are as friendly as the one that lives in our house, we need torespond quickly. The heart’s capacity to alter its rhythms— our HRV—and sendblood to where it’s most needed is necessary for our survival.The signal that the heart sends to the brain creates the state described inChapter 1 [chapter01.xhtml] as coherence. The beauty of knowing about coherenceis that we don’t have to guess when it happens. Easy-to-use sensors and softwarecan tell us precisely what level of coherence we’re in, as well as help us buildthe skills for even more coherence.14 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en14]Just to be clear, the heart and brain are always in some state of coherence. Inthe chaos of daily life and the presence of negative emotions, our coherencelevels may be low. Through simple exercises, such as the one at the end of thischapter, we can shift key parameters in our bodies to create higher levels ofcoherence. There’s a direct connection between the HRV in our bodies, our levelof coherence, and the resilience we have when facing the extreme changes in ourworld. The greater our level of coherence, the greater our HRV and ourresilience will be.With this in mind, the previous discussion of positive and negative emotions andthe role they play in our heart function takes on even greater significance.When we find the emotions that create greater coherence, we create greaterresilience as well.More coherence leads to greater resilience.Three Steps to Personal Resilience: Attitude Breathing®I’ve had the honor of working with the founders, staff, and researchers at theInstitute of HeartMath for over two decades. In doing so, I’ve also had theopportunity to share the experiences of life, travel, and the demands ofpresenting our work together to diverse audiences throughout the world. It’sthrough these experiences that I can now say that the years-long professionalrelationships have developed into deep and lasting friendships. During myassociation with IHM, I’ve seen the real-world expression of early-20th-centurypoet Khalil Gibran’s heartfelt observation: “Work is our love made visible.”15[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en15] At IHM, love is made visible each day as thefounders and staff reveal deeper insights into the power of the heart’sintelligence, and the role it plays each day in our lives.While the people at IHM will continue their study of the heart for years tocome, we can benefit from what they’ve discovered so far. In my opinion, amongtheir greatest contributions are the simple and proven techniques of creatingheart/brain coherence. (See Chapter 1 [chapter01.xhtml].) Through peer-reviewedresearch, IHM has shown beyond any doubt that two factors relate directly topersonal resilience in our time of extremes. * Our emotions can be regulated to create coherence in our bodies. * We can use simple steps to implement this fact in our lives.Working with some of the most prestigious organizations and innovativeresearchers in the world, IHM has developed a simple system known as AttitudeBreathing that allows us to apply the discoveries they’ve made in theirlaboratories easily in our everyday lives. The researchers describe the benefitof this technique, stating, “The heart will automatically harmonize the energybetween the heart, mind and body, increasing coherence and clarity.”16[backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en16] They’ve distilled the shift in emotions thatcreates the greatest levels of coherence into the following three simple steps,which are adapted from Transforming Stress by Doc Childre and Deborah Rozman(New Harbinger Publications, 2005):Step 1. Recognize an unwanted attitude—a feeling or attitude that you want tochange. This could be anxiety, sadness, despair, depression, self-judgment,guilt, anger, overwhelm—anything that’s distressing.Step 2. Identify and breathe in a replacement attitude: select a positiveattitude and then breathe the feeling of that new attitude in slowly andcasually through your heart area. Do this for a while to anchor the new feeling.Examples of Unwanted Feelings/Attitudes Examples of ReplacementFeelings/Attitudes Stress Breathe neutral to chill out and revitalize. AnxietyBreathe calm and balance. Overwhelm Breathe ease and peace. Sadness ordepression Breathe appreciation and nonjudgment. Guilt Breathe compassion andnonjudgment.Step 3. As you breathe a replacement attitude, tell yourself to take the “bigdeal” and drama out of the negative feeling or attitude. Tell yourself: Take thesignificance out. Repeat this over and over as you use Attitude Breathing untilyou feel a shift or a change. Remember that even when a negative attitude feelsjustified, the buildup of emotional energy will block up your system. Have agenuine “I mean business” attitude and heart intent to really move thoseemotions into a more coherent state. It could take a few minutes of AttitudeBreathing, but it’s worth the practice.As you keep practicing, you will start to create new neural pathways, and oldtrigger attitudes and resistances start to release.(Attitude Breathing® was developed by the Institute of HeartMath. Copyright ©2013 Institute of HeartMath.)img [images/common2.jpg]Over the years, I’ve visited with many indigenous families from various culturesthroughout the world. As different as their traditions have been from oneanother, a common theme runs through all of them. That theme is the power of theheart to change our bodies, heal our lives, and create unity in our families andcommunities. While modern science largely discounted the very essence of suchtraditions in the past, the results of studies from IHM and other organizationsare giving new credibility to the wisdom of our most ancient and cherishedspiritual traditions.Although our ancestors certainly didn’t use what we recognize as the scientificmethod to prove what they knew, their techniques of heart-based prayer,meditation, and healing appear to have been firmly rooted in their knowledge ofthe heart’s ability to influence our bodies and our lives. When I began tounderstand this fact as a young adult, it affected me in two profound ways.The first was that knowing about such relationships made any other discipline Icould ever study pale in comparison. After all, what could possibly be moreimportant than unlocking the mysteries of the single organ in our bodies that isdesigned to connect us with our everyday world and beyond?The second effect was to stimulate my curiosity. If our ancient ancestors wereso right about the power of the heart, what else did they know in their owntimes that we’ve forgotten in ours?The steps to coherence are as simple as focus, feel, and breathe.Transformation Begins with UsIt’s been said that the United States is a nation of communities. As true asthis statement is for America, I believe it’s equally true for all nations ofthe world. Through my research into the world’s ancient and indigenoustraditions, and the opportunities I’ve had to share what I’ve found withaudiences on nearly every continent, I’ve experienced the reality of thisstatement. From Tokyo to Lima, from Cairo to Bangkok, the biggest cities in theworld are made up of many small communities, each able to sustain itself on somelevels while needing to interact with other communities at other levels. Thesehuge urban complexes are made of local communities where people with similarheritages, backgrounds, interests, and ways of life have found common ground intheir need to connect.On an afternoon stroll through New York City, the difference between Chinatownand Little Italy is pronounced as you make your way from one neighborhood to theother. Yet as different as they are from one another, you’re still in the samecity. While the community-centered nature of a city may be obvious, it’simportant to identify it here because of the role that individuals—their statesof mind and resilience—play within the community. Psychiatrist M. Scott Peck,M.D. (1936–2005), summed up this idea clearly and logically when he said, “Forthe reality is that there can be no vulnerability without risk; and there can beno community without vulnerability; and there can be no peace—and ultimately nolife—without community.”17 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch02-en17]We are communal beings by nature, and living in communities of any size helps usmeet our physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, as well as providing usopportunities to lead healthy, joyous, and meaningful lives. Because communitiesfill so many of our needs, it’s not surprising that they also provide a way forus to share our vision of a better world and what it takes to get there. I’veknown people who have devoted their entire adult lives to their ownself-improvement. They’ve found the ways to heal the hurts of childhood; theabuse from unhealthy relationships; and even the health crises they face inlater years that commonly accompany the issues of low self-esteem, poor diet,and loss of personal value. From early in life, they’ve done all of the work forthemselves, yet wonder why the rest of the world doesn’t seem to reflect thehealthy values they’ve arrived at in their own lives.This is where the value and the power of community come in. While we can spend alifetime improving ourselves—and this can be a very good thing—having acommunity around us gives us a way to carry our work to the next level. In acommunity, we can share the benefit of our lifetime of work with others who areinterested yet have not had the same opportunities that we’ve had to discoverthe rich truths of personal power and resilience.While it’s always been healthy in the past to find other people willing to learntogether and share their innermost values as they pertain to everyday life,today it’s vital. In this time of extremes, the resilience that we develop asindividuals becomes even more effective, powerful, and potent when it can beapplied by our families, friends, and neighbors. When we share our healinginsights, we find the answer to the question of what it takes to create a way oflife that reflects the values we’ve discovered through our personal journey.In the foreseeable future, it will be the communities that choose to adapt tothe extremes of the new normal that will fare better—meaning, they will bestronger and better able to help others transform their lives in our time ofextremes.img [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE [contents.xhtml#toc_5]RESILIENT LIVING: [contents.xhtml#toc_5]Five Keys to a Healthy Community [contents.xhtml#toc_5]img [images/common1.jpg]“For a community to be whole and healthy, it must be based on people’s love andconcern for each other.”— MILLARD FULLER, FOUNDER OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITYThe Ethiopian village of Mudiyambo had relied upon cattle for their income,their food, and their livelihood for as long as anyone could remember. Asclimate change began to take its toll on African weather, however, the rainscame less often and the Horn of Africa became one of the most drought-strickenareas in the world. Entire herds of cattle were wiped out again and again, andthe village was desperate. When a global relief agency offered to retrain thevillagers to become agricultural farmers rather than cattle ranchers through aprogram called Transformational Community Development (TCD), the villagers’reactions were mixed. In the words of one of the agency leaders, “When westarted TCD, the number of villagers who were interested to get training wasvery small. Others considered it a waste of time.”1[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en1]With open minds, hard work, and a willingness to shift the thinking of the past,however, everything changed. The trainings began and the success was contagious.When the villagers who were originally reluctant to embrace the change saw withtheir own eyes how successful they could be growing vegetables in place ofraising cattle, they began “asking our TCD workers to get this lesson andwant[ing] to start [their own] agricultural activity,” says the leader.2[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en2]The shift is now complete, and the village is now an agricultural community witha healthy economy. And there were unexpected benefits that came with the shiftas well. The people discovered that their new economy is even more sustainablethan it was before the drought, and they are healthier due to their new dietthat provides nutrients on a regular basis.Mudiyambo is a powerful success story that government leaders are now hoping toduplicate in other villages throughout Ethiopia. It’s also a beautiful exampleof how the personal resilience of a few people willing to change their way ofthinking can become the path to transformation for an entire village. Thesuccess of Mudiyambo is a testament to the power of resilience and the role itcan play on a larger scale in our communities.What Is Community?Just as we discovered in the last chapter that resilience has a number ofdifferent meanings, the word community means different things to differentpeople as well. For some, the word immediately conjures up images ofWoodstock-like gatherings and the 1960s-style communes that were popularized inmovies such as Easy Rider, while for others it brings to mind isolated groups ofmen, women, and children in the rural setting of a self-sufficient village,sharing everything from children and partners to gardening and the chores ofdaily living. While it’s certainly possible that these features may exist insome communities in the world, in most they don’t. Today community is more aboutliving, working, and sharing with other people in ways that make life, andbearing life’s responsibilities, easier. With this idea in mind, it’s easy tosee why the types of communities run the gamut of expression.I’ve known communities made up of six to eight families, for example, that sharethe common bond of a particular spiritual practice. These families pool theirresources so they can buy a series of homes adjacent to one another within thesame neighborhood. They are literally next door to one another, and because theyare, they’re able to share child care, meal preparation, gardening, and thepractices that form the core of their spiritual lives while holding downfull-time professional jobs.While these particular groups are fully functioning communities unto themselves,they also represent a local branch of a national community made of other groupsof families that live in the same way in other parts of the world. Throughmessages delivered from a central office via fax, e-mail, and Skype, all of thelocal branches focus upon a common spiritual theme each week, such as compassionor cooperation. In this way they remain active on many community levels at once,from their local spiritual community to the greater neighborhood beyond theirimmediate community, to their professional communities, and ultimately to theirglobal spiritual community. This is just one example of one kind of community ina world of thousands or more similar communities. So when we try to describeprecisely what a community looks like, we find there are as many variations asthere are needs and ideas on the part of the people who form them. The reason isbecause community is all about us. It’s about everyday life, and the way we liveit.Communities are everywhere. They’re in the middle of the biggest cities of theworld, and they’re also in the middle of the biggest expanses of open andundeveloped land on the planet. A community can be one person living alone on amountaintop, or it can be a husband and wife and their two children living asour next-door neighbors. It can be the retired couple down the block sharinggardening tips with the soon-to-be-retired couple across the street.A community can be a room full of people who meet together at the town hall whenthey need to make a decision regarding taxes, roads, or whether or not to allowdrilling for oil in their county. Or it can be an organized group of people whoget together to build a home with Habitat for Humanity.A community can be two native women bartering for their family’s dinner on asparsely populated island in the middle of Lake Titicaca in Peru, or it can bethe mega-community of over 25 million people living, working, and sharing lifein the metropolitan area of Seoul, South Korea.So you get the idea. There are countless expressions of the idea of community,as they form in order to fill a variety of needs.As different as the communities may appear from one another in size and scope,however, the “glue” that holds them together is surprisingly similar. Whetherit’s a single person or a city of 25 million, two keys must be present for anycommunity to be successful. The members of the community share: * A common vision * A common bondIt’s through these two qualities that the needs of community members are met.And when a community’s needs are successfully met, it is also these qualitiesthat help sustain the community and prepare it for future challenges.Regardless of a community’s size or its reason for forming, the existence of ashared vision and a common bond are essential to its success.Not Your Grandparents’ CommunitiesWhile we’re surrounded by communities today, they’re often very different fromcommunities as we’ve known them in the past. In the 19th and 20th centuries, forexample, community was often the outgrowth of people who lived close to oneanother, fulfilling similar needs. Whether it was for food; security; orexpertise in building, gardening, or sharing the responsibilities of raisingchildren, people commonly looked to their nearest neighbors for the support theyneeded in their everyday lives. This has changed in the modern world.In the large high-rise apartments of any major metropolis today, it’s notuncommon for two families of similar size with children of similar ages to livein the same building, on the same floor, their front doors within feet of oneanother, and go for years without ever knowing each other’s names or even whatone another looks like. So while each family still has their needs met when itcomes to the convenience of an apartment and city living, their intimatecommunity of support and close-knit friendships may be spread out across milesof concrete-and-glass buildings, rather than forged with the people who aretheir closest neighbors. The reasons range from the impersonal nature ofcomputers and cell phones to the mind-set of independence that has played such apowerful role in America and the Western world—yet this kind of relationship isclearly not what our grandparents had in mind when they talked about community.Novelist and poet Margaret Atwood described how this dilemma has played outspecifically for America, stating, “The United States has promoted individualismso much that the responsibilities of giving to a community, and vice versa, havebeen trampled by rampant individualism.”3 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en3]From an even grander perspective, spiritual teacher Ram Dass has identified bothwhy the impersonal nature of today’s community exists as well as theconsequences it has brought to our everyday lives. “Our inordinate concern withindividuality has marked our group identity. I’m part of the problem,” heconfesses.4 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en4] “The ’60s were about individualfreedom, and we threw out the baby with the bath. We’re dealing with the effectof imbalance; we’re so focused on separateness that we’ve lostinterconnectedness, the inherent gregarious nature of humanity where we needothers to give us meaning. The web of violence in this culture is clearlyconnected to the breakup of these types of systems.”5[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en5]I believe there’s a lot of truth in what Ram Dass, Margaret Atwood, and a numberof other authors and experts have said about the role of community in our livestoday. While our communities serve their purpose on the grand scale, in everydaylife we’ve lost a big part of what made our communities so successful in thepast: the personal connection of knowing our neighbors and being aware of theirlives and their needs. I also believe that this is precisely where our lives areabout to change quickly and in a big way. The change is already happening, andit’s being driven by our time of extremes.In recognizing the principles that worked for the communities of the 19th andearly 20th centuries, we may also discover the clues to where the evolution incommunity is leading us today. If we can create our future communities basedupon the healthy things that worked in the past, yet model them without thedrawbacks of the things that didn’t work, then we’re well on our way to creatingnew lifestyles that can accommodate the extreme conditions of our time. The termoften used to describe such a rekindling of ideas from the past is taken fromthe popular 1985 movie of a teenager’s experience of time travel: back to thefuture.6 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en6]Many people are discovering that the seemingly new ways of thinking and livingthat work so well today actually represent a step backward to when they werecommonplace in times past. We may discover that the steps to our success in ourtime of extremes are actually the steps that take us back to our own future.In a world of increasingly impersonal and digital relationships, communityfulfills our need for personal connection through knowing our neighbors andbeing aware of their lives and their needs.“We Are One” Means We Share EverythingWe hear the mantra and see the words everywhere: we are One. It’s written onbumper stickers, silk-screened on T-shirts, printed on glossy book covers, andfeatured in magazine specials. The words emerged in the late 20th century inrecognition of the fact that the human family is just that: one big, diversefamily sharing one planet. Beyond the ideologies, politics, cultures, andreligions that sometimes tear at our unity and make us feel separate from oneanother, the fact is, we’re a single family unlike any other known to existanywhere else ever.It’s precisely because we are a global family that the problems experienced inone part of the world are rarely limited to that part of the world. While thisfact has always been true to some extent, the rise of globalism now makes our“oneness” the reason why community resilience is the key to our future. When wefind ways of thinking and living that work in response to the crises in one partof the world, just as the surrounding villages in Ethiopia clamored for thetraining that proved to change lives, the same thing happens on a larger scale.It’s no secret that we’re already a global society. With rare exceptions, suchas North Korea’s isolation from the rest of the global community, it’s fair tosay that the boundaries that have separated one country from another have becomea bit blurred and are becoming even more so. We no longer live in a world ofseparate economies, for instance. The financial markets that drive the economyare global and trade continuously 24/7. We also no longer live in a world ofisolated technology, energy, defense, or communication systems. The summertimeproduce found in our supermarkets in the dead of winter is grown on farms half aworld away and then flown, shipped, and trucked in on a daily basis. The voicethat answers the help number we call at 2 A.M. for technical assistance with ourcomputer is speaking to us, more often than not, from a call center locatedsomewhere on the other side of the world.Clearly, we live in a time when the line that has separated countries, cultures,technologies, and finances in the past is a fuzzy one at best. The 20th-centuryword coined to describe such complex relationships is globalization.In his book The Consequences of Modernity (Stanford University Press, 1990),sociologist Anthony Giddens, Ph.D., who is perhaps best known for his holisticview of global societies, defines globalization as the “intensification ofworldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way thatlocal happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and viceversa.”7 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en7] Personally, I like the definition offeredby sociologist Martin Albrow that identifies globalization as “all thoseprocesses by which the peoples of the world are incorporated into a single worldsociety.”8 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en8] Regardless of how we define it, theways in which we generally share information, ideas, technologies, goods,services, money, and people have created a world where we are more connectedwith one another than at any time in history. It’s this one world ofglobalization that’s created what can often be a mixed bag when it comes to thebig problems of the world and how we deal with them. There are now a number ofdrawbacks to a globalized world that are becoming clear.In his book Globalization (Oxford University Press, 2009), Manfred B. Steger,director of the Globalism Research Centre at the Royal Melbourne Institute ofTechnology University, gives us a place to begin exploring such a huge concept.He breaks the effects of globalization into five separate yet related categoriesthat offer us a way to honestly think about the pros and cons of each. Thesebroad categories or dimensions of globalization are: economic, political,cultural, ecological, and ideological. While each of these affects our abilityto live resiliently, there are two whose effects are obviously greater thanothers: a global economy and a global ecology. It’s these that I’d like to focuson here.A Global EconomyThe effect of a globally linked economy is a great place to begin a discussionof globalization. For one reason, it’s on everyone’s minds right now in thefirst two decades of the 21st century. The world is in the throes of an economiccrisis the likes of which we’ve never seen before. As mentioned in an earliersection, the amount of money that the world owes in debt is nearing thebreakeven point of what the world produces as income. Making matters worse isthe fact that the interest on the debt is accumulating in such a way that we areon the fast track for our debt to exceed our income. In other words, as a globaleconomy, we’re spending more than we earn.Among the largest economies in the world (including members of the G9 and theG20 nations) the solution has been to create more money to cover the debt in thenear term. As described in Chapter 4 [chapter04.xhtml], one of the effects ofsuch a practice is that the world’s money supply is flooded, and the value ofthe currencies is tremendously reduced.While there are as many opinions as to where the economic crisis is headed asthere are “experts” offering them, one thing is certain: the underlying reasonwhy the whole world is in the same boat is because our economies are so deeplylinked through globalization.In a globalized economy, the effects of one troubled economy send ripplesthroughout the world that affect other economies to varying degrees. This isprecisely what the world witnessed with horror in autumn 2008, when it waspublicized that some of the world’s largest financial institutions owed moremoney than they had in assets. When financial services firm Lehman Brothersdeclared insolvency on September 14 that year, an interconnected chain of eventswas set into motion that continues to this day. As some of the world’s largestand most respected institutions, such as Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, FreddieMac, and the insurance giant AIG, began to do what had previously been thoughtimpossible—to collapse into bankruptcy—the vulnerability of our global economywas quickly realized.In a 2010 interview, Henry M. Paulson, Jr., the former U.S. Secretary of theTreasury, stated, “If the system had collapsed, many Main Street companies ofall sizes would not have been able to get short-term financing to maintain basicbusiness operations, to pay their suppliers and employees who then wouldn’t havebeen able to pay their own bills. This would have rippled through the economy,resulting in millions more jobs lost, millions more homes lost, trillions ofdollars more in lost savings.”9 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en9] Such widespreadand devastating effects of the banking crisis could only be possible in aglobalized economy.One of the consequences of globalization is that we share everything, includingthe hardships of an unsustainable economy.A Global EcologyNature and natural resources are not bound by governments, nations, and borders.And it’s precisely because of this fact that the most pressing environmentalissues we face today are directly linked to globalization. When a local industryrelies upon local resources for its needs, such as a specific kind of fish, forexample, it’s possible to meet that demand in a sustainable way that assuresthat the resource is not destroyed in the process. But when the same industrytries to meet a demand that has grown hundreds of times larger due to a globalmarket for the fish, it can spell disaster. While larger markets and morecustomers can definitely be a boon for merchants, the downside is that they canalso lead to the damage or loss of entire species if the market is notregulated. The present-day near extinction of the bluefin tuna is a perfectexample of what can happen when a local industry goes global.The Atlantic population of the bluefin tuna is found in two primary locations:the western population, which breeds in the Gulf of Mexico, and the easternpopulation, which breeds in the Mediterranean Sea. Before 1950, there was littleinterest in the western bluefin as a commercial source of food. For thousands ofyears, the bluefin in general had been caught using traditional methods and inlow quantities that maintained a balance in their populations and supportedtheir migration and breeding. When the Japanese fish market began to skyrocketin the 1960s, however, the thinking regarding the bluefin changed. Suddenlythere was a tremendous demand on Japanese fisheries to provide the deep red,sushi-grade meat of the bluefin, not only to their own markets, but also tomarkets throughout the world.In addition to creating a larger demand for the delicacy, globalization alsoallowed for the sharing of new large-scale commercial fishing technology, andthe international relationships that meet the demand. In 1964, approximately18,000 metric tons of bluefin tuna were caught off the New England coast, morethan had ever been caught in a single year in the past. A 2011 report from thePew Charitable Trusts reported that the numbers reached as high as 20,943 U.S.tons per year (approximately 19,000 metric tons) in the western Atlantic at onepoint, a level that “could not be sustained, and the population crashed.”10[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en10] As of 2011, the catch has dropped toapproximately 1,984 U.S. tons. The continued pressure of such catches has nowdepleted the tuna population in the area by 80 percent.Even though quotas to protect the tuna were enacted in 1998, lack of enforcementcontinues to plague the industry. In his research into the role of globalizationand the tuna industry, anthropologist Theodore Bestor sums up the plight of thetuna in a single sentence, stating, “Sushi has become an icon of Japaneseculture, but it has also become an icon of globalization.”11[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en11]While the bluefin tuna gives us a specific example of what may happen in theunregulated environment of trying to meet the need of a globalized marketthrough a local resource, this phenomenon is not limited to the tuna. The UnitedNations Food and Agriculture Organization published a study in 2005 showing that70 percent of the species of fish now commercially exploited are already beyondtheir capacity to repopulate. The global demand for disposable paper productshas led to approximately 11 million acres per year of forest that are cut forcommercial industries. Ecological globalization refers to additionalenvironmental issues as well. The expansion of what were once local supplies ofgoods for a few communities into global markets for thousands of communitiesimpacts everything from population growth, access to food, and worldwide loss inbiodiversity, to the gap between rich and poor and the human contribution toclimate change.The bottom line to these sobering statistics is that the attempt to supply newand emerging global markets from traditional localized resources is not onlyunsustainable, but causes tremendous hardship when the unsustainable marketcollapses. Recognition of this fact is the key to the thinking that allows forresilience in our families and communities.Entire ecosystems can be destroyed when the needs of a globally connected marketare filled from a limited local source.The Bridge to ResilienceWhile we may not know exactly where globalization is leading the world, there iscertainly no shortage of opinions about what it’s meant so far. In an essay forNewsweek magazine, journalist Thomas Friedman describes how the riots thatdisrupted the 2009 G20 Conference held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reflectedpeople’s biggest fear for our global economy: that globalization is good forbusinesses only, and not so good for people. After describing the concernsexpressed by the rioters, Friedman shared his belief that “globalization didn’truin the world—it just flattened it.”12 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en12] In otherwords, he was arguing that the opening of global markets and making themaccessible to everyone, including our neighbors and small businesses, leveledthe playing field in a world that had been skewed in the past.Friedman left no doubt in the minds of his readers as to how he believed thatglobalization “raises the global standard of living” and stated “on balance[globalization] can benefit everyone, especially the poor.”13[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en13]While the viewpoints that oppose Friedman’s vary in their specifics, in generalthey argue that it’s not the change in the standard of living for the world thatthe protesters fear. It’s more about the evidence showing that huge corporationsare gaining more control over our lives and the way we live. Perhaps even morerelevant is the fear of the average person being powerless to stop thesecorporations from doing the things that are good for the bottom line ofbusiness, but bad for the human race and the sustainability of life on theplanet.Examples of where we see this kind of power emerging today are with the floodingof the markets with genetically modified seeds and foods, and also wherecorporations are harnessing technology that destroys farmland resources inexchange for the recovery of oil and gas. In both instances, fear is beinggenerated in the hearts and minds of some members of the public that thesethings are mandated for business, while those most affected have little say inthe defense of their homes and lives.Clearly, globalization is a mixed bag. There are certainly some people andindustries that have benefited. And some who have not. As globalization standstoday, it’s not a democratic process, and it’s been largely driven by those whobenefit from it the most. Just as clearly, it is a fact of life. We’vedefinitely gone global, and there’s no turning back. So while there’s no doubtthat economy, agriculture, and industry now work as global entities, what effectdoes a globalized world have upon our ability to live resiliently?Drawing upon the best of today’s leading-edge science and scholarly expertise,Judith Rodin, president of the philanthropic Rockefeller Foundation; and RobertGarris, managing director of the Rockefeller’s Bellagio Programs, aimed atidentifying solutions to critical global problems, have reported on the role ofresilience in the 21st century. They describe how the “growing need forresilience as a counterbalancing force to the vulnerability driven byglobalization means that development actors must act with greater urgency andsophistication to build the capacities of communities to adapt to change.”14[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en14] In other words, they’re saying that the need isclear and now is the time for precisely the ideas that are identified in thepages of this book.When we see the principles of such a shift in thought coming from influentialinstitutions, like the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as from grassrootsorganizations, such as the Post Carbon Institute, we can be certain that theideas are more than just a passing fad.Learning to create resilient communities and cities is a trend that’s here tostay.The aspects of globalization that connected the world in the past may bedestroying the world today.Building Blocks of ResilienceGlobalization in our world has changed everything. It’s changed the way we live,the way we work, the way we think, and the way we solve our problems. It’s evenchanged the kind of problems that we’re presented with. Judith Rodinencapsulates precisely why we need to think differently when it comes to ourcommunities and cities today: “What distinguishes today’s threats from those ofthe past are the escalating rate at which they are occurring, and the growinginterconnectedness of our planet. Building resilience is not a luxury. It’s a21st century imperative.”15 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en15]I agree with what Rodin is saying, and the obvious question, then, is: How?How do we go from creating personal resilience, as described in previouschapters, to building resilient families and forming resilient communities?Perhaps an even bigger question is: How do we do so in the face ofalready-established systems that people have come to accept as “the way” thingsare done?The study of resilient lifestyles and communities is a relatively recent area ofresearch. Some of the first studies to use the word resilience itself werepublished only in the early 1970s, referencing human illnesses: who gets sick,who doesn’t, and how quickly do those who do get sick recover? I’ve had theopportunity to study many findings from the research of others. I’ve alsowitnessed resilience personally in the rural communities of northern New Mexicowhen conditions of nature and broken economies have created tremendous hardshipwhere I live.I can honestly say that I’ve yet to find a single theory or method of resiliencethat holds all the answers that seem to be necessary. Just as there aredifferent kinds of communities that meet the needs of different populations,there are different kinds of resilience and a variety of ways to get there. Atthe end of this chapter, I’ll share some of the resources describing casehistories and real-world experiments in creating community resilience.I’d like to begin here with the broad factors that apply to any kind ofresilience, from a single family or neighborhood, to a digital community thatextends worldwide. One of the best summaries of these factors draws from theexpertise of hundreds of scientists and researchers contributing to resiliencestudies funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. These studies identify five keyelements of resilience that are general enough to cover nearly any communitysituation, yet specific enough to give us a place to begin.16[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en16] These core principles are identified as: * Spare capacity * Flexibility—the ability to change, evolve, and adapt in the face of disaster * Limited or “safe” failure, which prevents failures from rippling across systems * Rapid rebound—the capacity to reestablish function and avoid long-term disruptions * Constant learning, with robust feedback loopsWhen we consider the turning points that will be identified in Chapter 6[chapter06.xhtml] and the principles of personal resilience described in Chapter2 [chapter02.xhtml], we find that the general theme of the five principles ofresilience listed above provides an umbrella under which we can adapt andcustomize according to our personal and community resilience needs.Let’s take a closer look at each of these five keys and see how it fits into theturning points within our communities.Spare CapacityThere’s a big difference between having our needs in the moment met easily, andthoughtfully planning ahead so the same can be true for the future. There isalso a powerful difference between planning responsibly for the realities oflife, and hoarding frantically at the last minute to compensate for a lack ofplanning. When it comes to our time of extremes, we’re witnessing both of thesescenarios.I’ve met people who believe we’re heading toward a world that reflects theworst-case scenarios portrayed by cable-television documentaries. These arefrightening images that remind me of the classic 1979 movie Mad Max, showing apostapocalyptic world after climate change, war, and the end of oil.I’ve also known people at the opposite end of the spectrum, who have found theseemingly endless supply of fresh fruits, vegetables, and household products attheir neighborhood market so reliable that they believe things will always bethis way and count on an ever-constant availability of produce and other foodfor each and every meal. They’ve become so accustomed to finding what they needon demand that they feel there’s no reason to plan any further ahead than theday of the meal.Clearly, I like the idea of eating the freshest fruits and vegetables possible,and enjoy daily trips to the market when I can. The concern here is the issue ofwhat happens if the supply isn’t available. How long can these people, or any ofus, care for and nourish ourselves and our families with what we have today inour kitchen cabinets?As creatures of habit, we tend to reflect the way we lived life at a particulartime in our past. Once a habit is in place, we often give the idea of changingit very little thought. This is where the resilient principle of spare capacitycomes in. In our time of extremes, we’re finding that things simply don’t workas reliably as they may have in the past. What was once the rare interruption ofbasic services, such as electricity and full grocery shelves, is becomingcommonplace. The reasons range from “freak” storms, high winds, and deep snow tothe economic realities of downsized workforces, shorter workweeks, and fewerstocks of available goods. Following are some examples of such interruptions: * Electricity in the United States is becoming less reliable, following a trend that began 15 years ago. A study published by Massoud Amin, D.Sc., director of the Technological Leadership Institute at the University of Minnesota, states: “Since 1995, electrical grid power outages have steadily increased as R&D in new technologies steadily decreased.”17 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en17] * Among the increasingly apparent effects of extreme weather are temporary disruptions of vital supplies to local markets. Brooklyn, New York, in winter 2010 is a perfect example. For nearly a week, supply trucks simply could not get to the grocery stores that needed replenishing. A quote reported at the time by a local media source summed up the city’s dilemma. “Three days. No deliveries. You see all the shelves are empty,” said a store clerk.18 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en18] * After Hurricane Sandy slammed into the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, 8.1 million homes in 17 states lost electricity. The rationing of gasoline at service stations in New York City lasted for 15 days.19 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en19] * In February 2011, as temperatures dropped to a record 36 degrees below zero, a state of emergency was declared in northern New Mexico. The natural gas used to heat homes and farms was shut off without warning due to rolling blackouts that were an attempt to address the increased demand for power.Extreme weather conditions are catching multiple communities and entire regionsunprepared. The effects are devastating, and the disruption of services can lastfrom a few days to many months.Because we’re living in a time of such extremes, the resilient principle ofspare capacity makes more sense than ever. It makes sense to expect periodic andtemporary disruptions in the services that we’ve taken for granted for so muchof our lives. Far from the dismissive labels of “commando” and “preppers” thathave been used to describe people who take such precautions, to create sparecapacity is now a reasonable choice that reflects the facts of a changing world.To do so is simply responsible.We’re surrounded by wonderful models of spare capacity in nature. When theweather is good and food is plentiful, we see squirrels, for example, findingwhat they need for their daily nutrition. (This is like us going to theneighborhood market every day because we can.) We also see the same squirrelstaking extra food and putting it away for the proverbial rainy day, the coldmonths when they instinctively know that food will become less available. We seesomething similar with bears and other forms of life that instinctively add totheir body weight in the good times to sustain themselves when the times are notso good. (This is the equivalent of us creating spare capacity by stocking up ona few of the essentials that we rely upon every day, just in case there’s a daywhen we can’t get them.) In nature, we don’t see these animals in a chaotic andlast-minute frenzy, fighting tooth and nail out of fear of scarcity. They don’tneed to, because they’ve created the spare capacity in their lives that mirrorsthe reality of their world.FlexibilityWhether we’re talking about our lives or our communities, when it comes tocreating resilience, the principles of flexibility and change go hand in hand.In the 6th century B.C.E., the Greek philosopher Heracleitus observed the roleof change in our lives, stating, “There is nothing permanent except change.Nothing is permanent except change. The only constant is change. Change is theonly constant. Change alone is unchanging.”20 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en20]Saying the same thing in five different ways, he leaves little doubt in ourminds as to how he sees the role of change in our lives. His famous words areoften shared today in an abbreviated form.Science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov carried Heracleitus’s wisdom one stepfurther in the 20th century, when he said, “It is change, continuing change,inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensibledecision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the worldas it is, but the world as it will be.”21 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en21] Whenthe reality of constant change is factored into our plans for resilience, it’seasy to see the advantage of being flexible as well. It’s our willingness toaccept that the plans we’ve made, based upon what we knew to be true when wemade them, are subject to change at a moment’s notice.Our flexibility to adapt to unexpected conditions, and then improvise and go to“Plan B,” is one of the strongest links we can create in our chain ofresilience. The potential-tragedy-turned-success of the Apollo 11 mission—notonly once but twice—is a perfect example. Two times during the first mannedmission to the moon, the plans that had been carefully thought out by theexperts, that had been in place for years, and that had been described in thetraining manuals down to the smallest detail had to change at the last minute.The reason? The situation changed. The key to averting tragedy in the face ofthe change was flexibility.On the first mission to the moon, one of the most important factors was thetotal weight that the spacecraft could carry. The men, their spacesuits, theirfood, their equipment, and their fuel were all carefully weighed and kept to anoptimal capacity to ensure the safety of the crew and the mission’s success.Only a slim margin of error was built into the plans that could mean thedifference between success and failure, life and death.As the astronauts in the lunar module approached the spot for their firstlanding, they could see that a field of boulders made it more dangerous than ithad appeared on the radar screens and survey photos. In a last-minute decision,pilot Buzz Aldrin aborted the planned landing site in search of a safer place.As Mission Control nervously witnessed this unanticipated chain of events,Eagle, the lunar lander, found a smoother area and landed successfully with only15 seconds of fuel remaining.When the astronauts were ready to return to the orbiting module and come back toEarth, they noticed that a backpack had accidentally broken off the onlyignition switch that could restart the engines. Once again, flexibility was thekey. Thinking as a problem-solving engineer, Buzz Aldrin inserted the tip of aballpoint pen into the base of the broken switch, allowing him to manually startthe engines that would lift him and the crew from the surface of the moon.img [images/common2.jpg]While the flexibility to change our routines will probably never carry themagnitude of consequences that the first astronauts experienced on the moon,nonetheless we’ll all be faced with situations where our willingness to embraceunexpected changes and make the best of a situation can save our lives—or thoseof others. In creating resilience for natural disasters, for example, there isoften the need for multiple contingency plans—backup plans for the backupplans—to be used in the event that the conditions of nature prevent the firstplan from working.“Always realize you may encounter situations and circumstances that challengethe best plans,” says Robert Cherry, M.D.22 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en22] Heshould know. Speaking of his personal experience at a level-one trauma center inNew York City after September 11, 2001, he saw firsthand what can happen whenthe situation doesn’t fit the plan: “We felt the trauma center was prepared fordisasters, until we found things that we simply hadn’t planned for.”23[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en23] As well prepared as the hospital was, the teamsdiscovered problems with the contingency plans, including limited resources ofstaff, equipment, communications, and fuel.They discovered, for example, that the fuel supply for the backup generators wasdesigned to last for only 36 hours. These were the generators that powered thelifesaving and life-sustaining equipment for the trauma victims. What if therewas no additional fuel after that time? Dr. Cherry’s experiences from thatperiod led him to develop new programs at Penn State College of Medicine thatnow train people to be resilient in precisely such situations. Dr. Cherry sumsup the role of flexibility in extreme situations: “You have to adopt anemergency plan that allows for change because it is impossible to adapt aninflexible plan during an emergency situation.”24 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en24]Limited or “Safe” FailureDuring one of my first assignments as a software engineer in the defenseindustry, I asked my customer a question that led both of us to rethink ourentire approach to a problem. “If this program was to fail,” I asked, “and itstarted to lose information, how much could you afford for it to fail? How muchdata are you willing to lose?” The question opened the door to our discussion ofa way of thinking called limited failure. For an engineer, the idea of limitedfailure is common when it comes to a system or piece of equipment that’s sovital to the success of a mission that it’s actually called mission critical. Ifthe component fails, for any reason, the idea is to find a way to prevent itsfailure from ending the entire mission.For my client, before our conversation, his idea of failure and success had beenblack/white, either/or. Something either worked or it didn’t. Discovering thatit was possible for his software to break down, yet for the overall program tocontinue with a limited failure, was a new way of thinking—one he welcomed.The thinking with respect to limited failure has been very much a part ofscientific endeavors in America’s space program. When NASA sent the firstunmanned spacecraft to the surface of Mars, for example, its power system wasconsidered to be mission critical. No matter how successful everything else onthe mission was, if the spacecraft had no electricity, the mission was over. Toensure the mission’s success, the engineers built backup power systems. But theydidn’t stop there, they built backups to the backups as safeguards calledredundant backup systems. By creating alternative systems that could kick induring a power failure, the engineering team had stacked the deck of success intheir favor by minimizing the effect that a failure would have for the rest ofthe mission.It’s this idea of limited failure that comes into play when we think ofresilience as well.When it comes to resilience in our communities, the idea of limited failure is apowerful tool that goes a long way toward creating peace of mind. I’ve spoken tofamilies in rural areas of America, for example, who proudly announce that theyhave a backup well to supply water in the event the municipal water systembreaks down. They feel that their backup well helps them be prepared forhurricanes, tornadoes, and unforeseen extremes. They commonly forget, however,that to get their backup water, they need electricity to run the pump thatbrings it to the surface. My question to them becomes, “If the power goes out,how long can you be without your well?” Their answer to the question tells themwhen they should be thinking about limited failure—in this case, a backup sourceof electricity for their backup source of water.Although I’ve described physical systems to illustrate what I mean by limitedfailure, the idea also applies to the way we live our lives. We can create plansto limit failure in the event of job loss, family financial shortages, and evenloss of communication with the people closest to us.Rapid ReboundThe thinking underlying rapid rebound is precisely what the name suggests—ourability to resume function if something has been disrupted, and to do so in away that serves us. This applies to human emotions and psychology, as well asphysical systems such as power, water, and food.As mentioned previously, we humans are definitely creatures of habit androutines. When our routines are interrupted for any reason, one of the mostimportant factors for our emotional well-being is how quickly we can reestablishthem in some form. We find this to be true in circumstances that range frompeople who have been in captivity for long periods of time and those who findthemselves lost in the wilderness, to people stranded on deserted islands orconfined to tiny lifeboats lost at sea. From real-life accounts after the fact,where people have survived under such unnatural conditions, we learn that one ofthe first things they attribute their survival to is their ability to createroutines that give meaning to each day.In an interview, one of the Iranian hostages mentioned in the previous chaptersaid that even in the small cell where he was kept isolated from the otherhostages, he developed a daily routine of physical exercise, prayer, sleep,meals, and mental games that helped him rebound from the shock of being takencaptive. I’ve personally witnessed the need for such routines followingdevastating snowstorms that leave entire mountain regions isolated, and in theaftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which left miles of the Atlantic coastline lookinglike a war zone.One week after Sandy left homes, businesses, and neighborhoods in rubble, I wasscheduled to speak at a conference in New Jersey that I felt certain would becanceled. To the contrary, the promoters opted to go forward with the weekendseminar to build a sense of normalcy, the rapid rebound for people who had lostso much in the storm. We discovered that the hotel where the event was held wasone of the few that had a full complement of electricity, hot showers, phones,and meals, all of which would still be absent in some communities as long asfive months later.Rapid rebound is the key either to getting back to the old normal or toestablishing a new normal to meet the new conditions of a changed world.Constant LearningEach of the previous elements of resilience is only useful to the degree towhich it works in people’s lives. Whether we’re talking about a single family offour people living under one roof or many families in a digital communitydispersed across an entire city, the key to success is the principle of feedbackin learning. It’s only possible to find out what works and what doesn’t throughfeedback from people in the situation that’s requiring them to be resilient.Formally or informally, it’s good to identify mechanisms for your community’sfeedback. These can be as simple as a casual phone call or e-mail to let anorganizer know of your experiences, or as formal as an organized meetingdesignated for a specific time and day. The key is that the way in which thefeedback happens must be something that’s easy and works for everyone. When welearn these lessons, then we discover for ourselves and our communities what todo more of, what to do less of, and how little things may be tweaked one way oranother to become a real help.A proven model for community resilience includes the principles of sparecapacity, flexibility, limited failure, rapid rebound, and constant learning(feedback).Principles of Resilient CommunitiesThe idea of purposefully building communities of resilience is not a new one.Visionary individuals and groups of like-minded people have been workinginformally since the 19th century to find ways of living that are functional,are sustainable, and reflect the common values that bring the group together. Asyou can imagine, there are probably an infinite number of reasons forcommunities to form, and this fact is reflected in the number of communitiesthat have come and gone over the years.The community of Fairhope, Alabama, for example was originally founded in 1894and based upon a system of taxes that worked for everyone in the community.Rather than owning their farmland outright, the members leased the land for99-year terms, as do some Native American communities today. In this way, theland is used effectively by individuals and families during their lifetimes, yetstays in the community when the owners can no longer use it. The only tax in theFairhope community was a land tax that paid for schools, roads, and communitygovernment. The vision that brought Fairhope together over 100 years agocontinues to this day to sustain a small, successful, and thriving community.Other communities are based upon core principles that vary from spiritual valuesto simple living and the desire to raise children in a communal environment.Examples of successful communities founded in the 20th century that remain alivetoday include the Findhorn Foundation, established in 1962 in Scotland; AnandaVillage, founded in 1968 in California; and various other ecovillages. Asdifferent as the specific reasons why these communities formed may be, commonthreads have led to their continued success.In 1992, the Berkana Institute was founded as a think tank for innovation whenit comes to resilient living. In her own words, cofounder Margaret J. Wheatleydescribes the institute’s function:Since 1991, we have been learning from life (living systems) about how to createsystems that are interdependent, adaptive and resilient. Everything we have donehas been a conscious experiment to better understand two of life’s robustcapacities: self-organization—life’s process for creating order (effectiveness)without control; and emergence—life’s means for creating system-wide change,taking things to scale.25 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en25]While there are many pioneering organizations now exploring what it means tolive in community resilience, I’m sharing the example of Berkana here for tworeasons:First, in addition to my training as a scientist, I’m also a realist. Myscientific training tells me that nature is simple: the laws of nature aresimple, and they exist because they work. Nature surrounds us, and if we havethe wisdom to recognize what works for all other forms of life on the planet, itwill probably work for us as well. And this is the core of the Berkanaphilosophy. It begins with the belief that the community has within itself theintelligent systems that hold the key to solving its own problems as they arise.Briefly, these principles state that: * Every community is filled with leaders. * Whatever the problem, community itself has the answers. * We don’t have to wait for anyone. We have many resources with which to make things better now. * We need a clear sense of direction, and we need to know the elegant, minimum next step. * We proceed one step at a time, making the path by walking it. * Local work evolves to create transformative social change when connected to similar work around the world.26 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en26]Second, while spiritual, economic, social, and political values have formed thecore of many alternative, intentional, and resilient communities in the past,another factor is triggering the development of new and larger communitiestoday: the surge of new community growth has come from the sense that somedaywe’ll need what they’ve discovered to replace today’s unsustainable ways ofliving that are sure to fail. When we take into consideration the effects ofclimate change, globalization, and the impact of other extremes described inprevious chapters, it appears as if that time may have arrived.A Template for Community ResilienceIt’s been commonly said that every journey begins with a first step. Thecorollary to this statement, which is heard less, is that it’s what happens toget us to the first step that’s often the hardest part of the journey. Ourwillingness to recognize the need, our choice to make a positive shift, ourpromise to commit to the work it takes to see it through, and the disciplinethat such a journey requires give credence to this statement. Formally orinformally, every resilient community must begin somewhere.I recommend using the philosophy described by the Berkana Institute as atemplate to start the process. If you and the members of your prospectivecommunity can honestly agree that these principles work for you, then you’realready beginning your journey on the same page and you already have thefoundation of a solid philosophy to base your next steps upon.When it comes to creating a successful and resilient community, the key is tobuild the necessary principles into the model itself. One of the ways to do thisis to holistically create each step with these ideas in mind rather than tryingto retrofit them as an afterthought. In other words, these ideas must beconsidered in a way that works for the community. This can range from a formalset of written declarations describing the levels of community purpose anddevelopment, to a casual conversation and agreement between two families thataccomplishes the same thing and ends with a handshake.The real key is that the steps must work for everyone.The following steps offer a template of guidelines that every resilientcommunity must develop for itself, either formally or informally. 1. Identify the needs of your community. Why have you chosen to come together? Identify the common need that you hope to fulfill through your shared efforts. 2. Identify the vision of your community. Identify the goal or goals of your community, what success will look like, and how you will know when you get there. Some things to consider include: Are your goals specific and designed for a one-time need, or are they designed to become a way of life? Are your goals sustainable, and can they be accepted by the greater community or society at large? Be specific about what you hope to accomplish and the milestones that tell you when you’re successful. 3. Identify your plan. Identify the steps that lead to accomplishing your goals. Determine realistic timelines, and assume roles and responsibilities to accomplish each step of the plan. 4. Communicate. Identify a way to share thoughts, ideas, feelings, and concerns that will inevitably arise with any community process. This can be as informal as an agreement to share such concerns when they come up or as formal as a specific time to meet for just such a purpose. In this way, the community is constantly informing itself of what works, what doesn’t, and where there’s need for a rethinking of the methods and processes.This is an example of the kind of template that you may want in order to getyour community up and running. It’s intentionally general in nature so that itmay be used for nearly any kind of community.Now that we have the template, the best way to see how these principles work inthe real world is through case histories. Having lived in a number of ruralcommunities, as well as some of the largest urban areas in the United States,I’ve had the opportunity to witness firsthand various communities in action.I’ve also had the opportunity to see what works and what doesn’t when it comesto a group of people trying to apply what they’ve learned in small communitieson a larger scale.The minimum framework for successfully building a resilient community has beenfound to include: (1) identifying why your community is forming, (2) identifyingthe common vision for your community, (3) identifying your community plan, and(4) identifying how your community will communicate feedback.Self-Reliance vs. Self-SufficiencyWhen it comes to resilience in a community, two terms that often come up inconversation are self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Although the principlesthat I’m sharing in this book emphasize the more community-friendly ideas ofself-reliance, I’d like to clarify the differences underlying each term.Self-sufficiency is both a way of thinking and a way of living that strives forsome aspect of complete autonomy. In its purest form, people livingself-sufficiently would create everything they needed for all aspects of theirday-to-day life, and consume only what they are able to create and provide forthemselves. Clearly this is not practical in our modern world, and probably noteven desirable. It’s precisely because of the benefits that we find in adiversified community that we discover the power of group self-reliance.Alternatively, self-reliance is a way of thinking and living where we learn todo as much as we can for ourselves while integrating our strengths and skills incomplementary ways with others in our community. We can learn the skills ofgardening and food preparation for ourselves and our family, for example—a formof self-reliance that’s healthy for our bodies and frees us from commercial andstore-bought foods. At the same time, we can share what we’ve learned, andgrown, over the dinner table with friends in our community. In doing so, ourself-reliance gives us the ability to share with others from a place of strengthrather than need. While this may seem like a simple example, you get the idea ofwhat I’m saying here: we can learn to be self-reliant within the context of ourlarger community.As a point of clarity, there are certainly levels of self-sufficiency that fallbetween complete autonomy and community self-reliance. A self-sufficient sourceof energy for a family home is an example. I’ve met families who have been ableto accomplish energy self-sufficiency through a combination of renewable sourcesranging from passive and active solar farms to wind generators, and so on. Sowhile they’ve made a choice to become energy independent for themselves, ratherthan being isolated survivalists living in fear, they’ve done so from the choiceto be self-reliant. It’s this choice, as well, that allows them the capacity tobe there for others if the need arises.The point here is that the benefit of community is the point. When it comes tocreating resilience in the face of our rapidly shifting world of extremes,nature shows us that working to blend our skills, knowledge, and talent stacksthe deck of success in our favor. The key is that we must have a plan when wework together. This is where our template of resilience comes in.Perhaps the hardest part of building a resilient community is knowing where andhow to begin. Some communities form after the fact following a devastating eventsuch as the wildfires that have raged in recent years in America’s DesertSouthwest, Australia, and the forests of Italy. In these instances, the need torecover from their frightening and devastating experience brings neighborstogether in community.There are other resilient communities that form before the need actually arises.While the members hope they never face the fury of hurricanes, tornadoes,wildfires, or floods, these realities are built into their community plan.They’re already resilient to our time of extremes.For either kind of community, the steps are similar. Using the four stepsidentified in the template for community resilience offered in the previoussection, let’s consider a community based upon a real-life situation. In thisway we can illustrate precisely how such a community is formed.Building a CommunityI’ve seen beautiful communities form, only to disband at a later time, for anumber of reasons. The irony of living in places that are an hour from thenearest grocery store and acres away from your nearest neighbor is that thepeople who choose such a lifestyle typically do so precisely because they don’twant to be involved with other people. They don’t particularly want to be partof an organized group, a community association, a road association, or any kindof association.So while rural communities are sometimes the most difficult places to get peopleto work together, it’s in doing so that they can find the strength to preservethe very qualities of the land and the way of living that have attracted them torural life. I’m sharing this observation because it was through organizing andparticipating in precisely such a community in the early 1990s that I had theopportunity to witness the results of developing a community resilient to anumber of changes that were threatening its way of life.Every community begins with a reason to come together. In the case of mycommunity experience, it was the threat of losing the rugged beauty and rurallifestyle that had drawn the people to the area to begin with. In the early1990s, real-estate developers from out of state had come into the remotewilderness of north-central New Mexico in search of land for development. Asthey drove for miles seeing only sparse homesteads, ranches, and thousands ofacres of undeveloped wilderness, to their eyes the land that was our home lookedlike wasted potential. The developers proposed building homes—hundreds ofthem—along with a shopping mall, two full-size golf courses, and a medicalfacility on our community’s land. And to make the area more accessible to theirdevelopment, they also proposed the expansion of a small community airport, thewidening of existing roads, and the building of new ones.Clearly, my informal community of ranchers, farmers, gardeners, beekeepers,carpenters, and artists was in danger of losing the pristine beauty that madeour way of life possible. We needed to organize. On the night of our firstmeeting, we sat in a circle of chairs that had been provided by the localvolunteer firehouse, looked at one another across the room, and asked the onlyquestion we could: “Now what?”That question set into motion one of the most powerful, motivational, andsuccessful communities that I’ve experienced in my life. And from the originalcommunity that rose up in response to the threat of the developers, newcommunities were also formed to create resilience in the face of a number ofthreats and changes that are unique to such a rural lifestyle. So while theneeds may vary, the principles that worked for us can work for any situationwhere people want to build security for themselves and their children in acommunity environment.In our example, this is how it was done:Step 1: Identify the needs of your community. In the example of my ruralmountain community, we began by stating our common needs: to preserve the openspaces, beauty, and unspoiled nature of the wilderness that we’d chosen for ourhomes.Step 2: Identify the vision of your community. Once we were clear on what wewanted to happen, the next step in our planning was to create a vision of how wewanted the needs we’d identified to be met, and what the success of our visionwould look like. This is always an interesting process that ignites theimagination with many possibilities, some more likely to become reality thanothers. Yet I’ve found that in addition to helping a community move into theprocess of working together, it’s this step, perhaps more than any other, thatopens the floodgates of communication and a deep sharing of people’s thoughts,attitudes, experiences, loves, and desires for themselves and their families,particularly their children.In our case, we followed the guidelines of community building and became veryspecific very quickly. We stated that the community was being formed to fill aone-time need (or so we thought) to preserve the land and the way of life thatwe cherished. We felt that we could accomplish as an organized group with avoice what we could not as individuals, by periodically working together on oneaspect of the problem or another.Step 3: Identify the plan. During this step in the process, we got down to brasstacks by naming specific action items. As is to be expected in any groupdynamic, some people were vocal and bubbling with ideas, while others satquietly, listening and chiming in only when they felt they could contribute in ameaningful and useful way. I believe it’s fair to say, for everyone in ourcommunity, that we were pushed to the edge of our comfort zones, and maybe alittle beyond, as we made commitments and accepted responsibilities for thesteps that would need to happen to ensure the success of our plan. While we allwanted the same thing—to preserve our way of life and the beauty of ourvalley—we quickly discovered that we were basing our goals on the emotions ofour attachment to the land. As a geologist, I offered to take our efforts onestep further and base our case on the availability of groundwater.The magnitude and scale of the development being proposed would require hugeamounts of water, which is an increasingly rare resource in the arid deserts ofthe Southwest. My role was to develop a factual assessment of the groundwater inthe area, including the size of the reservoir, the thickness of the aquifer, andhow many years it takes for the winter snow to percolate through the rock andrecharge our water table. Using maps from the United States Geological Survey ofthe geology and water wells in the area, our community worked together to builda solid case. We presented evidence that the groundwater levels could notsustain the proposed development, as well as the data showing how the proposeddevelopment would compete for irrigation water all the way to the Texas border.Step 4: Communicate. Staying in touch with members of a community while you’reworking toward a specific goal is the key to coordinating everyone’s efforts.Because our community was so geographically spread out, we had to be especiallycreative in the ways that we communicated. We agreed to meet on a weekly basisfor nearly eight weeks to put our arguments together. During that time, weshared phone numbers, fax numbers, and physical addresses, information that canbe a hard to come by in rural areas. Members met over coffee, tea, familydinners, and late-night cookie feasts. And when all was said and done, ourinformal community of people who had reluctantly joined together to save theirway of life became a close-knit community involving friendships that continue tothis day.One morning, just a few short months after we came together for the first time,I drove with four community members three hours to New Mexico’s capital, SantaFe, and met with one of the state senators who would help us present our case. Ishared the groundwater assessments, the maps we’d created, and the impact thatthe proposed development would have upon communities throughout the state. Therest, as they say, is history. The State of New Mexico did not grant the permitsthe developers needed to proceed with their plans, and our valley has remainedintact ever since.What Does It Take?I’ve shared the story of how a mountain community had to organize in order toillustrate how a real-life community can follow the template for resilience. Inthe case of the mountain community that I was part of, the members discovered anew strength within themselves as they got to know one another. And while thecommunity was created at first for a specific purpose, it continued in variousforms long after the original goals were met. It’s because of the strength anddiversity the members found among themselves that the relationships persistedeven as the community faced new challenges beyond the ambitious land developers.These included evacuations during wildfires, aid in reaching stranded livestockduring record-setting snowfalls that made the dirt roads impassable, and floodsthat washed away entire roads and kept some people away from their homes forweeks as the snow melted.As we’ve seen in the previous sections, resilience is as much a state of mind asit is a way of life. It’s about being willing to honestly embrace the immediaterealities that we face in our everyday lives and to act responsibly to meet theconditions of those realities. Our mountain community coming together topreserve a way of life is one example of how a community can form and what itcan accomplish. In our case, we found the knowledge, methods, and relationshipsthat helped us in a specific instance. And in doing so, we created a process andreservoir of skills that we can now draw upon in future times of need. Ourcommunity became resilient to the things that threatened our way of life.As we’ll see in the following chapters, there are actions we can takeimmediately that will lead to the transformation of our own neighborhoods. Theworld is changing. It makes tremendous sense to adapt to the changes rather thanfight them, and to do so alongside our friends and neighbors as we buildhealthy, resilient, and thriving communities.What Is Your Threshold?When we talk about resilience in general, one of the first questions that comesto mind is: Resilience to what? What is the actual force or condition that weare shifting our thinking and lifestyle to accommodate? It’s a simple questionand one that makes a lot of sense. The answer is simple as well.We’re learning to become resilient to the world we’ve created.It’s in precisely understanding what this answer means, and what it is thatwe’ve created, that we can begin to build the resilience that makes senseaccording to our specific needs.When you consider creating a resilient community, the first question to askyourself and other potential members is: “What would we like our resilience toaddress?” To get to the bottom of what this can mean, I invite you to considerthe following: 1. What are the elements of your physical surroundings that you consider an absolute necessity in the short term (from a few hours to three days)? 2. What are the elements of your physical surroundings that you consider an absolute necessity in the long term (from three days to two weeks, or more)?Different people have different thresholds of what they feel they can and cannotlive without. This is especially true in times of crisis when we’re oftenfrightened, caught off guard, and unprepared.For instance, people will generally say that they can do without electricity fora brief time, ranging from a few hours to a few days. For young people, such anexperience can even seem like an adventure. During the time when the luxuries oflife such as electricity are no longer available, the use of backup sources oflight, such as lanterns, flashlights, and candles, will generally get peoplethrough the nights, and propane and natural gas will often sustain them forcooking and heat. Beyond this time, however, most people seem to need more. Thisis the time for long-term strategies to kick in.The key here is to ask yourself what these questions mean to you. What is yourthreshold? Your answer will point you in the direction of what resilience meansfor you in a time of extremes. The way you answer these questions is yourtip-off as to when you need to seriously consider measures that can assure youand your family of a sense of normalcy when faced with the vulnerability ofextremes. In other words, your answer will be the key to know when to storeextra food in your pantry, and what kind and how much. Only you can know foryourself when it’s time to consider a backup source of power and whether yoursneeds to be a full-size generator to run your house or a large battery to powerthe lights in your living room.While we sometimes feel reluctance, or even resistance, to putting our energyinto thinking about such things, in view of the facts shared in this book andother sources of news and information, it actually makes perfect sense.Community Resilience: It Just Makes Sense!The Introduction of this book, as well as the next chapter (Chapter 4[chapter04.xhtml]), identify the rare conditions of climate, debt, population,and energy that are converging as a period of extremes and vulnerability in ourlives. In light of the specifics, there can be little doubt regarding just howvolatile things have become, and in all likelihood will remain for theforeseeable future. It’s precisely the certainty of so much uncertainty thatgives even greater meaning to a culture of resilience. For example: * It’s because we’re living amidst what the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks 2013 report, detailed in Chapter 4 [chapter04.xhtml], called the “perfect storm” of conditions that it makes sense to expect volatility in places where life has been smooth sailing in the past. * It’s because climate change and a warming of the world’s oceans is a fact that it makes sense to expect record-setting extremes in rainfall and snowfall, sizzling summers, and frigid winters. * It’s because the world’s economies are weakened and fragile that it makes sense to expect cutbacks in manufacturing and the loss of jobs in supporting industries. * It’s because the already-reduced workforce and extremes in climate have placed a strain on the supply chain of services, food, and necessities that it makes sense to expect temporary disruptions in their availability.It’s because these extreme conditions, and others, are converging in ourlifetime that the choice to create a resilient community is also the turningpoint from simply surviving change to thriving through the change. Just as we’veseen with the turning points described previously, we now have two possible waysto deal with the reality of a shifting world that has unexpectedly arrived onour doorstep. We can choose either to: 1. Discount the facts that tell us the world has changed, and that we need to think and live differently, leaving ourselves and our families vulnerable to the new conditions.or2. Be honest with ourselves about the volatility that comes from the convergenceof extremes, and learn to adapt our thinking and ways of life to minimize thenegative impacts of the change.With both choices, resilience plays a powerful role. In the first choice, wefind a way to become resilient after the fact—after the crises of thesuperstorms, back-to-back tornadoes, record-setting floods and droughts, and theseemingly endless wildfires catch us surprised and unprepared. In the secondchoice, we can live resiliently, in a way that makes room for such changes inour lives.Our answer to a single question makes all the difference in our experience. Itchanges the way we’ve lived and the way we’ve been taught to think aboutourselves and our security. It’s also the foundation for developing a new way ofliving. That question is: In our time of extremes, what can we do to make ourlives better?By the year 2050, only 36 years from the initial publication of this book, it’sestimated that 75 percent of the world’s population will be living in urbanenvironments and large cities. Fifty percent does already. As the factors thatcontribute to our time of extremes continue to unfold, a shift in the way webuild our cities and live our lives will, by necessity, be a part of that shift.When we take these factors into consideration, the conclusion is clear: adaptingour lives to meet the uncertainties of a world of extremes is like packing whatwe need as we begin a journey to a place we’ve never been.Just as it makes sense to begin any journey with the things necessary tomaintain our daily routines, community resilience in our time of extremes makesgood sense. A growing number of community leaders are recognizing this fact andbeginning to act accordingly.One of the innovative projects that has emerged from leaders recognizing ourtime of extremes is the 100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge, anopportunity to build proven strategies of resilience into 100 cities, usingprojects that will be selected through a nomination process ending in 2015. Thestated goal of the challenge is “making people, communities and systems betterprepared to withstand catastrophic events—both natural and manmade—and able tobounce back more quickly and emerge stronger from these shocks and stresses.”27[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en27]Additional projects to create resilience on the larger scale of cities andbeyond include Philadelphia’s Reinventing Older Communities conferences28[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en28], the San Francisco Planning and Urban ResearchAssociation (SPUR) project The Resilient City29 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en29],and the Municipal Art Society of New York’s Resilience Agenda.30[backmatter02.xhtml#ch03-en30]The transformation of societies, cultures, and everyday life that has beenenvisioned by so many people for such a long time will come about only inresponse to a need that is shared across the board. From urban families andmom-and-pop businesses, to the home offices of global corporations, researchinstitutions, and universities, we all need a society that works for us. Thebuilding of resilient communities on the scale of cities is an opportunity forjust such a transformation. This is where the ideas of resilient community andthe principles described in books like David Gershon’s Social Change 2.0, DuaneElgin’s Voluntary Simplicity, Lester Brown’s Plan B series, Edmund Bourne’sGlobal Shift, and others (see Resources [backmatter01.xhtml]) can becomeinvaluable road maps on our journey of transformation.For us to benefit from the kind of transformation envisioned in suchforward-thinking projects, however, there is a key element that must first befirmly in place—we must begin by being honest with ourselves about why there isa need for such transformation. What’s so different about our world today thatrequires us to think and live differently than we have in the past? What’sdriving the change? It’s a good question asked by many people from many walks oflife. The answer can be a surprise, as well as a wake-up call, when it comes tothe choices we make for ourselves and for our families.img [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR [contents.xhtml#toc_6]NOW IS DIFFERENT: [contents.xhtml#toc_6]Our Time of Extremes [contents.xhtml#toc_6]img [images/common1.jpg]“Not till we are lost, in other words, not till we have lost the world, do webegin to find ourselves.”— HENRY DAVID THOREAU, AMERICAN ESSAYIST AND PHILOSOPHERThe first rays of the morning sun were just breaking over the horizon as Istepped down from my truck onto the ground of the ice-covered parking lot.Although the glaze under my feet was unusual for the time of year, simplyknowing that fact didn’t make my walk to the cashier inside any lesstreacherous.

As I steppedthrough the door into the warm air inside, an older-looking man was sippingcoffee from a thermos at a table near the window. He had just seen the wholedisplay of me slipping and sliding from my truck to the door. As I passed histable, without even looking up at me he said, “Slick out there, ain’t it?”“So you saw my dance?” I asked jokingly.“Yeah, I saw the whole show. Those boots of yours ain’t no good in this kind ofweather. You need to get some of these,” he said, pointing to his thickrubber-soled work boots under the table. “I’ve got some,” I replied, “butthey’re back at home. I usually come through here later in the day when thesun’s up and the ice is gone. I got a late start out of town last night, though,and didn’t want to drive over the pass in the storm. So I spent the night at theBest Western.” I pointed in the direction of the only hotel in town. I thoughtthat was the end of our exchange, so what I heard next took me completely bysurprise.“Yeah, I know what you mean,” the man said. “It ain’t s’posed to be so cold thistime of year. But everything’s changed. The native people told us this wascomin’ . . . all of it. They told us the rain would stop, the weather wouldchange, and people would go crazy tryin’ to figure it all out. Problem is,nobody believed ’em.”The man’s words were completely unexpected and totally out of context for themorning—at least for me they were. For him, however, these were obviously thingsthat were on his mind. For the first time, he peeked up at me from under thebrim of his threadbare John Deere cap.He looked directly into my eyes, and with a big breath said, “Now everything’shaywire. It’s all messed up, man. It stopped rainin’ in the rainy season. Mywheat stopped growin’ when it’s s’posed to. My cows can’t find any grass toeat.”He continued, “It ain’t good. But what are you gonna do? You gotta keep livin’.You gotta keep tryin’ and just do the best you can. But I’ll tell you onething—this ain’t business as usual, that’s for sure.” The old man stood up toleave, and took one more sip from his thermos. I’d barely spoken, yet I felt I’djust experienced an extraordinary conversation.As he turned and walked toward the door, he finished, “You take care now, youngman. There’s a whole lotta nothin’ between where you’re at now and where you’regoin’.”I watched as he walked to his old International Harvester pickup. I knew they’dstopped making those trucks over 30 years earlier. I followed him out the door,stood, and watched until the rumble of his truck faded into the sounds of themorning. I thought about what he’d said and wondered if it was true.It’s a fact that the world has changed in big ways, but it’s hard to put afinger on precisely when the change began. There was one thing the old man saidthat I couldn’t deny: We’re living a time that is extraordinary by any measure.Our world today is truly no longer business as usual!Now Is DifferentIt’s true. Now is different. The world that we grew up with is gone, and it’snot coming back. It disappeared before our eyes. While we were shopping for theweekly groceries, putting meals on the table for our families, and caring forour aging parents, the familiar world we’ve known and trusted disappeared. Theproblem is that no one told us this was happening. No one told us that our liveswere being changed forever.There was no announcement in the headlines of The Wall Street Journal or USAToday. There was no media special on the cable channels, no investigative reporton the nightly news, and no exposé on a glossy magazine cover to catch ourattention at an airport newsstand. Because the world we knew no longer exists,and its disappearance has never been widely acknowledged in mainstream thinking,we’ve never had the opportunity to acknowledge the greatest shift in our lives,impacting the greatest number of people in the history of the world! We’ve neverhad the chance to say good-bye to the things that are gone and mourn theirpassing.We saw evidence of our world vanishing as the mom-and-pop shops that used toline the streets of our small communities gave way the big-box stores that drovethem out of business. The family-owned farms that we used to rely upon for oureggs and milk every week have become a rare sight even in the rural areas ofAmerica. The neighborhood shops that we counted on to fix everything from theholes in our shoes and our tires, to the lawnmowers that trimmed the grass weused to grow in front of the homes that we used to own are becoming memories ofanother time. An entire way of life has vanished, and it happened so fast thatmany people still don’t know it’s gone and never coming back. They don’t realizethat we’re in a vulnerable world of transition, and for now, a time of extremes.This is where the problem begins. Because they don’t know the shift hashappened, they’re still waiting for the world of the past to return. They’rewaiting for life to get back to “normal.” Consciously for some, unconsciouslyfor others, they’re clinging to an idea of the world that used to be, to the waythings used to work, and to where they fit into that world. Many people have puttheir lives on hold until that familiar world returns. They’ve put off makingbig decisions, like when to get married, when to have children, and when to lookfor a new job in a new industry to replace the one that no longer exists.They’ve put these things off because they’re waiting for the world to settledown and get back to normal. While they’re waiting, they’re missing the bestpart of life: life itself!An entire way of life has vanished, and we’ve never had an opportunity to mournits passing so that we can let it go.Waiting for “Normal” to ReturnI remember a conversation I had a few years ago that beautifully illustrateswhat I mean by waiting for life to “get back to normal.” I was talking to agas-station attendant in a small mountain town about the weak economy and howpeople in the area were coping. “How are things in this part of the world?” Iasked. “Has business been good here?”With a shrug, the woman behind the counter stopped counting the change in thecash register and looked at me. “Do you really want to know?” she asked.“Absolutely,” I said with a smile as I handed her my credit card. “I wouldn’task if I didn’t.”“Nothing’s been the same here since the mine closed,” she began. “People weremaking good money. They had good jobs, good benefits, and job security. Atleast, they thought they had job security. Then everything changed. Everythingjust went to hell. It’s always been a mixed bag around here with the mine. Whenit’s open, things are great. When it closes, it’s pure hell and people gothrough hell. A few years ago the price of the ore dropped so low that the minehad to close, and just like that there were hundreds of people with no jobs.”“That’s got to be tough,” I replied. “How much of the town works in the mine?”“When it’s open, it’s the biggest employer in the county,” she explained. “Inthe good times, they ran 24/7, using around 600 people to cover three shifts upthere.”“Wow, that’s quite an operation! How many people live in the town itself?” Iasked.“Our population is about 1,850 people,” she replied. “About a third of the townhas worked in that mine. When it’s good, it’s really good. And when it’s bad,well . . .”“So what’s everyone doing now?” I asked. “How are they making a living?”“Oh, they’re around,” she said. “They’re doing whatever they can to get by. Someof the guys are mechanics working on cars by the gas station down the road. Someare cutting winter firewood for locals or baling hay. They’re doing just aboutwhatever they can to get by until the mine reopens.”“How do you know the mine will reopen?” I asked. “How long’s it been since itclosed down?”“It closed five years and two months ago,” she said. “There’s a skeleton crewworking there now to keep things moving. We keep hearing rumors that it’sstarting up again, but nobody knows for sure. All we can do is hope.”“I’ll hope with you, and keep you in my prayers,” I told her as I signed myreceipt.Another customer was coming in as I turned and walked back outside to the beautyof the mountains that towered over the town. I was amazed by what I had heard.Driving back to the main road, I couldn’t help thinking of the parallels betweenwhat the woman behind the counter had just shared about her small community andwhat’s happening on a bigger scale in the world at large. Perhaps moreimportant, I’d experienced firsthand the way in which people often deal with thekind of change that tears at the fabric of their security and their lives.In the case of the mine, it was closed because the world changed. The ore thatthe livelihoods of those townspeople once depended upon is now being mined inChina for a cheaper price. That change is one facet of an even larger shift inthe balance of global resources. For the mining community, it’s a shift in favorof another economy located in another country.The point here is that people who are reluctant to release the security of doingwhat’s familiar to them are missing the opportunity to create even greatersecurity in the new world that’s emerging.We sometimes justify our reluctance to let go of the past through a belief thatthe changes we see are temporary. In the same way that music-industry executivesbelieved the revolution of rock ’n’ roll was a temporary craze when it firstappeared in the 1950s, or the way some technology “experts” believed computerswould be a passing fad when they burst onto the scene in the 1960s, when we seeso much change on such a large scale happening so quickly, it’s a sure sign thatwe’ve outgrown the world of the past. And that’s why it’s impossible to return.Our reluctance to accept that the changes exist may even compromise our abilityto adapt—we can only cope with changes that we acknowledge.How can we thrive in the new world if we’re focused on waiting for the old worldto return?A Radical ShiftThere are layers of change in the emerging world that surrounds us. These factshave led to the certainty of where we find ourselves right now, in this verymoment: we’re living with a new set of rules for our lives, our careers, and thebig picture of the world.The best minds of our time are in agreement that you and I are living a radicalshift in the world and our lives that’s unlike any other in recorded history. Soprecisely what are we facing today that no generation before us has had to face?While answering this question could fill the pages of an entire book—and otherauthors have done a beautiful job of doing just that—to do so is not the reasonI’m making this point. Rather, it’s to provide the background for why we nowneed to think differently.With these ideas in mind, the following is a summary of the climate, population,energy, and economic conditions that make “now” so different from times past.Climate ExtremesIt’s not just our imagination. It’s not just the emphatic warnings ofoverzealous environmentalists that tell us we’re in a time of climate extremes.It’s not just the elders of the world’s indigenous communities sharing thewisdom and warnings of their ancestors regarding our era. It’s the data itselfthat tells the story. And the data tells us that we’re living a rare era ofcyclic change that few humans in the past have ever experienced. Since themid-1990s, our global family has met with the crises, and risen to face theaftermath, of a growing number of weather-related extremes—from record-settingfloods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and temperatures, to killer superstorms—that havehad consequences unparalleled in recorded history. * Fact: We’ve crossed vital ecological thresholds that are necessary for Earth’s survival (such as too-high levels of CO2 and species extinction).1 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en1] * Fact: There has been a two-and-a-half-fold increase in the number of devastating floods worldwide that occurred between February and May 2010 as compared to the number of floods during the same season of the year in each of the years between 2002 and 2006. * Fact: There has been an increase in the number of North Atlantic tropical storms that the National Weather Service documented between 1998 and 2007, a trend that continues to the present day. * Fact: There has been a dramatic surge in the number of wildfires (associated with drought) since 1998 in North America and throughout much of Australia and Europe.While it’s certainly not unusual for weather-related disasters to occur, it isunusual for there to be so many of them occurring in so many places in the worldat the same time. “Each year we have extreme weather,” Omar Baddour, the chiefof the data management applications division at the World MeteorologicalOrganization in Geneva, Switzerland, has explained, “but it’s unusual to have somany extreme events around the world at once.”2 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en2]Even while Baddour was alerting us that global weather events for winter 2012would go beyond business as usual, a bizarre series of storms were wreakinghavoc across the globe. These included massive floods in the United Kingdom,extensive fires in Australia, and an epic storm of both rain and snow thatthreatened the lives of 160,000 Syrian refugees living in temporary camps set upin makeshift shelters in Lebanon. Before the winter months arrived, it wasalready clear that 2012 would be a year for the record books. By year’s end, theextremes had left a legacy that included: * The world’s ninth-warmest recorded year since 1850 * Record low rainfall in the United States and the most severe and extensive drought in at least 25 years * Record high temperatures in the United States, with 197 all-time highs tied or broken * Superstorm Sandy, which brought a record 32.5-foot-high wave to New York HarborA study published in the journal Climatic Change tells us without reservationthat extremes such as these are more than just local anomalies. They’rehappening on a worldwide basis, and the world simply isn’t prepared for howquickly the climate is changing. “The last decade brought unprecedented heatwaves,” says the lead author for the report, Dim Coumou. “For instance in theU.S. in 2012, in Russia in 2010, in Australia in 2009, and in Europe in 2003.”3[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en3] Coumou summarizes the impact of such extremes inone sentence, stating, “Heat extremes are causing many deaths, major forestfires, and harvest losses—societies and ecosystems are not adapted to ever newrecord-breaking temperatures.”4 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en4]While the decades-old controversy regarding the existence and causes of climateextremes appears to be far from resolved, the data of the earth itself revealsthe facts. It’s a fact that the history of the planet is one of dynamic changein climate and weather patterns. It’s also a fact that patterns of the pastsuggest we should be experiencing a time of warming at present.The ice-core data represented in the top graph in Figure 4.1 clearly showsEarth’s cycles of warming and cooling over the last 420,000 years. The “0” onthe right-hand side of the scale is the present day. It indicates that we’re nowat a place in the cycles where it’s reasonable to expect a general warming ofthe planet. The question is, How much should we expect?The bottom graph in Figure 4.1 gives us a clearer picture of what our warminghas looked like for a smaller period of time. Here, the revised indicators forthe last 2,000 years show that temperature deviations during the medievalwarming period (MWP), between 820 C.E. and 1040 C.E., were nearly four timesgreater than what we’re experiencing today. Another warming episode in the late1200s involved deviations twice as great as those seen today.5[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en5] While the variations are in fractions of a degreeCelsius, I’m sharing them here to offer a rounded perspective on climate changeand what it’s meant in the past.It’s interesting to note that these temperature changes occurred without thefactors that are commonly believed to be the cause of such extremes, such asindustrial sources of CO2. The question is, Why? If the CO2 was not the triggerat that time, what was? And what does it mean for us today? These are questionswe must honestly answer if we are to address the issues of climate change in ameaningful way.img [images/pg131.jpg]Figure 4.1. It is a fact that the world’s climate is changing, and that warmingis a part of this change. The top graph shows historic cycles of warming, aswell as cooling, indicated by ice cores over the past 420,000 years. Source:Petit/NOAA/GNU free documentation license. The bottom graph shows temperaturedeviations for the last 2,000 years, both above and below levels considerednormal. Here the data clearly shows the cyclic warming and cooling of the past,including the medieval warming period (MWP) with temperatures of 0.5°C above thenorm, and the cooling that followed. Source: Adapted from Energy andEnvironment, vol. 19, no. 1 (2008).This is where the honesty of acknowledging the data comes in. If, as the datasuggests, we’re experiencing the new normal of a changing climate and theeffects that it brings, including the warming of the 20th century and theexpected cooling in the 21st, then it makes perfect sense to adapt to the changeinstead of waiting for conditions to return to the way they used to be. It makessense to adapt the way we live, grow our food, and build our homes—and torethink the choices of the past that now leave us vulnerable to the extremes oftoday. It makes sense to reexamine our ideas of resilience and the role it playsin adapting to, rather than recovering from, change.We’re living a time of climate extremes that is unlike anything in livingmemory.Population ExtremesAs I touched upon in my previous book, Deep Truth, from the end of the last iceage, about 12,000 years ago, until sometime in the mid-1600s, the size of theentire population of Earth is believed to have been pretty much stable. Duringthat time, the number of people born was offsetting those losing their lives toeverything from woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers to the brutally coldwinters caused by climate change. So for 11,500 years or so, there had beenfewer than 500 million people on the planet. To put this into perspective, itmeans that during this time the number of people being sustained by theresources of our planet was less than half the number now living in India today.After 1650, conditions changed and the population began to grow. Theillustration in Figure 4.2 gives us a sense of how quickly that growth happened.img [images/pg133.jpg]Figure 4.2. Estimate of Earth’s total population from 10,000 B.C.E. to 2000 C.E.The steep increase approaching 2000 began to be evident in 1804 when the globalpopulation reached the 1 billion mark. The dramatic population growth since thatmilestone is unprecedented in the history of the world and a key factor in theincreased demand for energy, food, and other resources needed to sustain ourglobal family. Source: EI T, public domain.Between 1650 and 1804, the population doubled to 1 billion people. After thefirst doubling, it took only 123 years to double again to 2 billion. Since thattime, the trend has continued, with each doubling taking less time. As thenumber of people in the world increased to 3 billion, 4 billion, 5 billion, and6 billion, the number of years it took to add each additional billion peopleshrank from hundreds to 33, 14, 13, and 12, respectively. In 2012, our globalfamily reached a new record of about 7 billion people. While the speed ofpopulation growth appears to have slowed since then, it continues.As Joel E. Cohen, Ph.D., mathematical biologist and head of the Laboratory ofPopulations at The Rockefeller University, stated in Scientific American, “Thepeak population growth rate ever reached, about 2.1 percent a year, occurredbetween 1965 and 1970. Human population never grew with such speed before the20th century and is never again likely to grow with such speed.”6[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en6]The good news in Cohen’s assessment is that the population explosion appears tohave topped off about 40 years ago. The flip side is that most of those bornduring that peak are still alive and need to find the resources in terms offood, water, homes, and jobs to sustain them through their life spans, now withan average expectancy of 67 years worldwide. This is where politics, technology,lifestyle, and age-old customs are converging to create the hotbed of socialcrises that we see today.The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose vast resources for datacollection provide some of the most accurate and timely information possible,describes the need to record such statistics: “The [population] growth rate is afactor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by thechanging needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals,housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapidpopulation growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.”7[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en7]While the rate of population growth in our world peaked between 1965 and 1970,we still need to find the resources to sustain those born during the peakthrough their expected life spans.Energy ExtremesThere’s a direct link between the number of people in the world and the demandfor energy. While we’ll explore the relationship between population and energyin later chapters, the point here is that the world’s growing population, andalso the growing numbers of people aspiring to Western ideas of anenergy-intensive lifestyle, has pushed the demand for energy up to recordlevels. For the last century or so, that demand has been met mostly through theuse of fossil fuels.During the 19th century, coal was so abundant in Europe and North America, andso inexpensive, that it quickly became the fuel of choice for the world. Formore than 100 years, coal powered the steam engines for the factories, ships,and railroads of the Industrial Revolution. In 1800, it’s estimated that theworld produced about 10 million tons of coal per year to satisfy its energyneeds. By 1900, that number increased 110-fold to over 1 billion tons. Today,coal remains the primary source of energy used to power the turbines that createelectricity for the world. In 2010, 7.2 billion tons were produced worldwide.At the current rate of use, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimatesthat the world has about a century and a half of remaining “economicallyexploitable” coal reserves.8 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en8] Coal, however, is notthe energy used for things beyond the world’s industrial power grids. When itcomes to heating our homes, cooking on our kitchen stoves, and fueling ourautomobiles, we rely upon oil.Following World War II, oil became safe, cheap, and popular. Oil has been thefuel of choice for domestic energy uses since that time. While the world’s oilreserves looked nearly inexhaustible at the start of the oil era, crude oil isin fact a finite resource, and it’s unreasonable to rely upon this shrinkingresource for the growing energy needs of the world in the future. While thismakes sense intuitively, it was a geologist in the 1950s who put this fact intoperspective and gave us a timeline for the world’s oil. That geologist was M.King Hubbert, Ph.D.In what has become the key to determining how long we can expect the world’s oilsupplies to last, Hubbert placed the telltale factors for oil (estimatedreserves, proven reserves, recoverable reserves, and so on) into a formula todescribe how much exists and how long before it is exhausted.9[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en9] The result was the statistical curve that nowcarries his name, Hubbert’s curve—more commonly known as the peak oil curve.Figure 4.3 on the next page shows the theoretical peak oil curve and the actualcurve from oil production. The real-world data correlates almost exactly withthe predicted curve. Compelling results such as these are now applied to globalestimates to give us a realistic idea of how long the world’s reserves willlast.img [images/pg136.jpg]Figure 4.3. This illustration shows geologist Dr. M. King Hubbert’s estimatesfor peak oil production in the United States, along with the curve showing theactual production. This comparison illustrates the accuracy of Hubbert’scalculations and makes a compelling case for the accuracy of similarcalculations on a global basis. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration.The result? We’ve already passed the time of peak oil, and it happenedapproximately 25 years ago—in the mid-1980s. We’ve now entered an era of relyingupon oil that’s harder to retrieve and more expensive to produce to meet theglobal demand for energy. The dilemma is that while we know that the “cheap” oilis gone and the world’s reserves are shrinking, the demand for oil is actuallystill increasing every year. Figure 4.4 below shows how this demand first beganto exceed production in the mid-1980s. While a growing environmental awareness,coupled with more efficient automobiles, has actually lessened the demand foroil in the developed Western nations, the world’s overall demand continues togrow, largely due to emerging economies, such as those of India and China.Until recently the amount of oil available has for the most part been able tokeep pace with what is needed. It’s clear, however, that this relationshipcannot last under the present conditions.img [images/pg137.jpg]Figure 4.4. This illustration shows the global production of oil compared to theglobal demand. The data shows that two trends are clear: (1) the demand for oilbecame greater than the available oil in the mid-1980s, and (2) the gap betweendemand and production is growing. Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy(June 2011).Now that the availability of cheap oil is declining, scientists have to lookdeeper into the oceans under many miles of water and deeper in the earth undermany miles of rock for the remaining deposits. Both of these factors make thedrilling more difficult and increase the costs of retrieval, making crude oilless profitable to produce. The term that describes this relationship is returnon investment (ROI). The decreasing ROI on oil production today is already afactor that’s giving new meaning to the term peak oil.While oil will continue to be an important way to meet the energy needs of theworld for the foreseeable future, it’s becoming less so because other, renewableforms of energy and advances in natural-gas technology are turning the energyequation of the world upside down.Economic ExtremesWhen I look out from the stage into the audience during my seminars, it’s notuncommon to see participants’ eyes glaze over at the very mention of the wordeconomy. Many people automatically link the word with money, a topic that seemsboring and too technical. But when I share with them that the economy of theworld is about much more than money, they become curious. “How can you have aneconomy without money?” they’ll ask. The answer surprises some people.Whether we’re talking about the economy of a family or the economy of a planet,the truth is that it may include money, but it doesn’t have to. Our globaleconomy is part of the fabric of relationships that weave the families,communities, and nations of the world together. It’s the means for us to sharethe things we have with other people who need them, and for them to do the samewith us. Without an economy, we couldn’t share the food, energy, medicine, andgoods that are vital for our lives each day.With this idea of an economy in mind, the audience suddenly moves from beingonly slightly curious to intensely interested. Suddenly the meaning of the topicbecomes crystal clear: we’re talking about their lives and the very essence ofthe changes that are affecting them each and every day.While the topic of the world economy would be interesting to explore at anytime, it’s crucial to do so in our time of extremes for one very importantreason: it’s in trouble. Depending upon which expert you ask, some will say thatthe global economy is fractured and needs healing. Others will say that it’sbroken and beyond healing. Almost universally, however, all will agree that theglobal economy as we’ve known it is teetering on the brink of a collapse unlikeany we’ve ever seen.While the reasons contributing to such a precarious situation are many, and wecould trace the roots of our vulnerability to a number of factors that began inthe last century with the banking system itself, to do so is beyond the scope ofwhat I can do justice to in a few pages. And while such information isinteresting, it’s really not the focus of the changes we can make in our livestoday to be more resilient. So I’ll limit this portion of the book to two keyelements that are converging upon the economic landscape of the world. Both arecontributing to our time of extremes and affecting your life right now.These factors are: 1. The reserve currencies of the world 2. The unprecedented levels of debtEach of these ideas alone is simple to understand. When we put them together,they tell a story. This story will become important in later chapters of thisbook, which continue to explore creating resilience in your life.So, let’s begin. . . .Factor 1: The Money Everybody UsesFollowing World War II, the United States had arguably the strongest economy inthe world, based on the strongest and most stable currency: the U.S. dollar.Because of its strength and reliability, the dollar was adopted as the currencyof choice to be used between countries for big purchases of things like oil,gold, and food. On July 22, 1944, it officially became the reserve currency ofthe world. The definition of a reserve currency is a “currency that is held insignificant quantities by many governments and institutions as part of theirforeign exchange reserves.”10 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en10]Having a global reserve currency has its advantages and its disadvantages. Forthe country issuing the currency, it’s a good thing, because it ensures there isalways a demand for its money. It also gives that issuing nation an advantagewhen it comes to exchange rates and buying imported commodities. The downside isthat the health of the reserve currency affects every economy that uses it.Today, the world uses multiple reserve currencies. These different currenciesare held in a “basket” of which the U.S. dollar and the European euro make up acombined 90 percent. As the primary reserve currencies, large amounts of thesetwo currencies are held in the world’s financial institutions and banks (seeFigure 4.5). The additional 10 percent of the reserve basket is made up of othercurrencies such as the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen, and the Swissfranc.img [images/pg140.jpg]Figure 4.5. The U.S. dollar and the European euro are the primary reservecurrencies for the banks of the world. Because large transactions betweennations for commodities like energy and food are made using these reservecurrencies, their stability has a big effect on the global economy.This means the health of the dollar and the health of the euro have a greatimpact on many of the economies of the world—and this is where the problemsbegin. The debt linked to the reserve currencies is one of the factorscontributing to our time of extremes.Factor 2: Debt, Debt, and More DebtIt’s no secret that the global economy is in crisis or that debt is a big partof the problem. Rarely a day goes by when we’re not reminded by the media of thedebt crisis in Europe or the staggering debt that the world is accumulating.While debt has always been a critical factor for governments and nations toaddress, following the financial crisis in the United States in 2008, duringwhich tremendous amounts of money were dedicated to averting a global bankingcollapse, the debt of the U.S. and the world began to spiral out of control. In2012, for example, the global debt was a record $48.8 trillion, over two timesgreater than the $19.9 trillion owed only ten years earlier, in 2002. By autumnof 2013, global debt had increased to a staggering $51.5 trillion, followingwhat appears to be a trend of escalation that will continue into the foreseeablefuture.11 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en11] This situation has placed us inuncharted territory. Never before have the largest economies of the world, likethose of the United States, the eurozone, and Japan, for example, been carryingso much debt that it equaled or exceeded their annual income, or gross domesticproduct (GDP).12 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en12]The way in which this crisis is being addressed at present is for countries thathave debt to add more money to their money supply to ensure there’s enough topay the bills and keep the wheels of commerce turning. While the term often usedto describe this practice is printing money, these days only a relatively smallamount of money is actually created as the physical, hold-in-your-hands kind ofcurrency. The creation of money is more about monetary reserves and expansivemonetary policies, such as the quantitative easing programs (QE1, QE2, QE3, andso on), designed to create the effect of adding money to the system.The good news is that this solution is having a steadying effect on the world’seconomy for now. Each time the money is created, Social Security checks arecovered, federal employees are paid, and life appears to continue as usual. Theflip side is that there’s another effect that makes this solution unsustainablein the long run.When more money is created, whether it’s dollars, euros, or yen, it means thatmore money is in circulation and each unit is worth less. In other words,because there’s more of it available, the currency becomes diluted and weaker.Just as is the case for anything that’s diluted, this means it takes more of thesame currency to pay for the same things than it did in the past when thecurrency was stronger. The bottom line is easy to imagine: when our debt goes upand more money is created to cover our obligations, the value of our money goesdown.This devaluing of the dollar has been a big factor in the higher pricesAmericans have seen at gas pumps, in grocery stores, and at prescription-drugcounters. Between 2000 and 2011, for example, the price of corn, one of theworld’s most important food crops, rose from $75 per ton to over $310 per ton.13[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en13] Between 1998 and 2008, the price of gasolineincreased from an average of $1.02 per gallon to an average $4.02 per gallon—awhopping 294 percent!14 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en14] These factors—devaluationand debt—are also contributing to problems in parts of the world that rely uponthe reserve currencies for the necessities of everyday life. The weakening ofreserve currencies due to growing debt has put the cost of food, energy, andhousing beyond the reach of household budgets in nations where the annual incomeis only a fraction of what it is in more affluent Western countries.The record-setting debt of the world, and the resulting weakening of majorcurrencies, is a key factor contributing to our time of extremes.Considering the extreme conditions of our climate, the extreme demands forenergy, and the extreme pressure being placed on our economies—all of which areamplified by extreme population levels—it’s fair to say that we’re living in atime of tremendous volatility. As my friend at the convenience store at thebeginning of this chapter observed from his corner of the world, life iscertainly no longer “business as usual.”Maybe Peggy Noonan, a columnist with The Wall Street Journal, has said it best:“We are living Days of Lore. Days of big history.” Clarifying what she means by“big history,” she continues, “We are living through an epoch scholars 50 yearshence will ask about and study. . . . They will see us, you and me, as grizzledveterans of something big.”15 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en15] I think there’s alot of truth to Noonan’s remark. Everywhere I travel in the world, there’s asense that we are, in fact, living in a time of something big.In my opinion, if we can get a handle on: (1) why so many seemingly separateshifts are happening, (2) why they’re happening now, and (3) where they’releading us, then we’ll have taken a giant leap toward making sense of the changeand our place in it. In doing so, we could also create a renewed sense of hopeand optimism for ourselves, our families, and our communities. This hope couldbecome the common denominator for people coming from different cultures,spiritual and religious traditions, and ways of life, and it also gives us areason to think beyond our differences to the realities that are transforming usall. The key to our survival is to acknowledge the facts of what we’re upagainst: the things that are changing and what the changes mean in our lives.Never in the modern world have we attempted to meet the growing needs of so manypeople through shrinking supplies of so few resources, with climate changesupercharging the demand.Temporary Extremes or the New Normal?Until recently, there’s been a tendency to think of the kind of extremes I’vejust described as anomalies that are separate and unrelated. The result of suchthinking is that we end up attempting to put out the fires of one problem hereand another one there. While we can do so with varying degrees of temporarysuccess, we never really get to the core issues at the heart of the extremes.This approach brings to mind the image of holding a balloon full of water,noticing a leak in one place and trying to stop it just as another leak appearsin another place. When we think of climate change, for example, we’ve been ledto believe that if we were to stop using fossil fuels and embrace a clean,green, and sustainable lifestyle, we would somehow fix the warming that’s partof our time of extremes. While I definitely believe in and support thedevelopment of clean, green, and sustainable forms of energy, and we definitelyput less strain on resources with energy-saving lightbulbs in our homes andoffices, and riding our bicycles to work and school is definitely healthier thandriving, there is a consequence to making these lifestyle changes in the beliefthat they’re the answer.For a growing number of people and policymakers, focusing on these commendableshifts in the way we live has become a diversion from a stark and uncomfortablereality: the records of the earth itself tell us that the changes we’re tryingto stop are actually characteristics of a new normal. Rather than acknowledgingthe scientific facts, such as those in Figure 4.1—which describe climate cyclesof the past, what we can realistically expect today, and how we can adapt to thechanges—their thinking suggests that we can return to the old normal, such asthe climate of the 20th century. The problem with this thinking is that thefocus becomes one of stopping and reversing the changes, rather than creatingthe resilience to adapt to them.We’ve been led to believe we can fix the problems, rather than adapting to theextremes that have become the new normal.This is one of those places where the type of conversation I’m having with youcan sometimes become uncomfortable and, for some people, difficult. The reasonis because it means acknowledging the fact that the extremes are real, and wherethey come from. If we embrace the history of the earth itself, for example, itclearly shows that we’re living at the time in a repeating cycle when big shiftsin climate have been triggered in the past. Mainstream media, popular science,and traditional classrooms and textbooks have been reluctant to acknowledge theaccuracy of the ancient calculations that describe such changes, specificallythose of the 5,125-year cycles described by the Mesoamerican calendar. That is,until recently.In a paper published in 2004, Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D., a glaciologist with OhioState University’s Byrd Polar Research Center, describes a sudden shift inclimate 5,200 years ago that gives us insights into the shift we’re experiencingtoday. Thompson reveals that discoveries from a number of different sources, ina number of different locations across the globe, all point to a startlingconclusion. From pollen in lake-bed core samples in South America and methane inice cores in Greenland and Antarctica, to tree-ring data from the United Kingdomand plants preserved in the ice caps of the Peruvian Andes, the story told bythe records of the planet is unmistakable: the climate changed dramatically5,200 years ago, and the impact to life on Earth was immense.It’s not so much the fact that a big change occurred that’s making theheadlines; it’s when the change occurred. We’re generally used to thinking ofclimate shifts as things that happened when dinosaurs roamed the earth andpeople, once they appeared, lived in caves. What makes Thompson’s discoveries sopowerful is that, in the overall scheme of history, 5,000 years really isn’tsuch a long time ago. To give this revelation a bit of perspective, the studyreveals that the change happened within recorded human history, just 3,000 yearsbefore the time of Jesus, during the early Bronze Age.“Something happened back at this time and it was monumental,” Dr. Thompsonsays.16 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en16] Describing the significance, hecontinues, “The evidence clearly points back to this point in history and tosome event that occurred. It also points to similar changes occurring in today’sclimate as well [author’s emphasis].”17 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en17]From studies like Thompson’s we can gain insights into the changes that we’reliving through today, and perhaps more important, insights into how we may adaptto them in our lives. I’ve personally spoken at conferences where the organizersthemselves believed that the facts about our time of extremes should not beshared publicly. The reason given to me for holding back this information waseven more disturbing than what the actual data is showing. “We don’t want toscare people,” is what I’ve been told.I understand the intent of such comments, and honestly believe it comes from asense of responsibility and feelings of genuine caring. However, I also believethat while pacifying people’s anxiety may have worked for some situations in thepast, it no longer serves us to follow this line of thinking today.When I hear such statements, it reminds me of a dysfunctional family trying todeal with individual outbursts of rage that tear the members’ lives apartwithout first acknowledging the underlying trigger. The fact is that thisthinking doesn’t work for a family, and it won’t work for the world. Our time ofextremes has placed us in uncharted territory. If ever there was a time when weneeded to be honest with ourselves about what we’re up against, I can’t think ofa better one than right now!Tipping Points of ConvergenceFrom the studies of respected “think tanks” like the Worldwatch Institute,founded in 1974 to independently research critical global issues, and the WorldResources Institute, founded in 1982 to analyze environmental policy; toUNESCO’s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Synthesis Report, drafted by 1,300scientists in 95 countries, it’s clear that the best minds of our time have gonebeyond the warnings of the past to alert us to dangerous trends ofunsustainability. We’re now living in the time that they warned us of in thepast, and the magnitude of the changes we’re experiencing is our cue to sit upand take notice.In 2005, Scientific American published a special edition, “Crossroads for PlanetEarth,” which confirmed that ours is no ordinary time. One section describes thehuman race as “now entering a unique period in its history.”18[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en18] The purpose of the magazine issue was to identifya number of global crises that, if left unchecked, hold the potential to endhuman life and civilization as we know it today: everything from new diseaseswith no known cures and energy-intensive nations exhausting Earth’s finiteresources, to never-before-seen levels of global poverty and habitual disregardfor the health of oceans, rivers, and rain forests. The conclusion wasunanimous: we simply cannot continue living as we have in the past if we expectto survive even another 100 years.Earth cannot sustain our habits. Over 1,000 scientists from various disciplineshave honed this idea into a report released by the World Economic Forum, aptlytitled Global Risks 2013.19 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en19] The bottom line isthat the conditions of climate change and the teetering global economy pose thepossibility of a “perfect storm” of crises that will impact the world for a longtime to come.The point that these organizations and others are bringing into public awarenessis that each of the scenarios identified in their reports is catastrophic, andall are happening now. The contributors to these special bulletins and reportsare certainly not alone in their assessments of our situation. They, along withother science-based researchers—who range from independent authors to members ofthe intelligence communities of the United States, including the Pentagon andCIA, which see the crises as threats to stability and security—have soundedunmistakable alarms loudly and clearly.The alarms are telling us that we’re already in trouble—nature is already at atipping point of losing the oceans, forests, and animals that make life as we’veknown it possible. When we factor in the reality of broken economies, vanishingresources, climate change, and the loss of entire industries—along with the jobsthey provided for our families and communities—then the individual extremes takeon a new meaning.The tipping points of no return in different areas of our lives are leading usto a time of convergence. While different reasons have been given as to why somany crises are occurring in such a brief period of time, there seems to be ageneral consensus regarding the big picture: something extraordinary isunfolding in our world.How do we begin to define something so big that it has been anticipated forthousands of years, has the potential to alter every life on Earth, yet can’t beencapsulated in a single word or idea?It may be precisely because the implications of our time of extremes are so vastthat there’s been a reluctance to even acknowledge that we’re in the midst ofsomething so big. Maybe the conditions, challenges, and crises we face, alongwith our communities, our nations, and our world, are best summed up byevolutionary biologist E. O. Wilson. He states that we’re living what he calls a“bottleneck” in time, when the stress upon both our resources and our ability tosolve the problems of our day will be pushed to their limits.20[backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en20]Having discovered that respected organizations are pointing to the same criticalissues and reaching the same general conclusions, we can clearly see that we’rein the midst of a rare convergence of factors that is creating a transition forour world. The question is: Where does the transition lead?Are we headed for a world of destruction? Or are we headed for a world oftransformation? Our failure to recognize the big picture and where the trendsare leading us may ultimately be the worst problem we face.Fortunately, this problem is solvable.Will the convergence of tipping points make our time of extremes one ofdestruction or transformation? The choice is ours.Us/Them vs. WeWhen we look closely at the biggest shifts in our world, we see a common themethat brings the reason for so much change front and center, and into crystalclear focus. It’s simply this: the only things that are collapsing are ways ofthinking and living that are no longer sustainable. The fact that so many facetsof daily life are breaking down so quickly tells us where the thinking of thepast no longer works. And from peak debt to peak oil, the simultaneous bucklingof big systems tells us that now is the time to rethink the very beliefs thathave driven our choices in the past.Facts such as these have led many experts to view our time of extremes as a timeof crisis as well. But the word crisis doesn’t necessarily mean that somethingbad is happening. It can also mean that something big is happening.I used to have an aversion to the word crisis. Recently, however, I’ve come toappreciate it for one reason: if we say we’re “in” a crisis, it means that westill have time to fix the problem. If we say that the crisis is “over,” itimplies there’s nothing more we can do. So the fact that we’re still in themidst of the crises of climate change, economic volatility, and energyproduction means we have a chance to adapt. These are consequences that we facetoday for a past way of thinking. Because the world has changed, these issuesare asking for our immediate attention.Never have so many people been asked to think so differently and to solve somany big problems in such a short period of time.We live in a world where everything is connected. We can no longer think interms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live. Todayit’s all about we. It was precisely to create a greater sense of we-ness that wedeveloped the Internet that links us together, the transportation industry thatmoves people between continents and nations, our financial markets that operate24/7, and the cell-phone networks that allow us to text our loved ones on theother side of the world at 3 A.M. The purpose is to connect us. But this hasbecome like a double-edged sword: our global connections allow us to shareeverything from our music, art, culture, and celebrations—the good—to thenot-so-good problems of scarce energy, food, and money.During a recent trip to Cuzco, the high-elevation ancient capital of Peru,nestled in the Andes Mountains, I witnessed the grand opening of a McDonald’srestaurant. It was located just a couple of doors down from the historic400-year-old cathedral in the city’s central square, which houses some of theoldest New World relics of the Catholic Church, predating the Spanish conquest.There’s little beef in the area, but the local staple of alpaca (an animalrelated to the llama) is plentiful. So the Andean version of the Big Mac isactually made of two patties of alpaca meat in a sesame-seed bun covered by thatfamous special sauce.I witnessed the same thing happening in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, located atan altitude of 12,000 feet above sea level, where the local meat, yak, issubstituted for the beef used in the West. The Tibetans in the area love to jokeabout the Big Yak burger that has replaced the traditional Big Mac. The point isthat globalization has made McDonald’s, Starbucks, and KFC, for example,familiar sights in remote places of the world today, just as they’ve been fordecades in the biggest cities of the United States and Europe.The same oneness that makes it possible to share such commercial pieces ofculture, as well as fashion, music, and art, also makes it inevitable that bigproblems in one part of the world will affect the lives of entire communities inother parts of the world. This means that the effects of climate change, forexample, are showing up as price increases that reflect the smaller harvestsfrom drought-stricken fields of the world; the slowdown in the global economy isshowing up as the closure of factories and the loss of jobs in our localneighborhoods; and the rise in global debt is translating into weakness in ourlocal currency and the record-low interest that we’re being paid on our CDs andretirement savings accounts. Through these simple examples it’s clear that wecan no longer separate the world “out there” from what’s happening at our familydinner tables, in our classrooms, and in our offices.Our oneness also means that we can no longer separate spirituality from oureveryday lives. During the media session and interviews before a public seminar,it’s common for the interviewer to ask me if I’m going to talk about the“science stuff” or the “spiritual stuff.” My answer to the question is generallynot what the interviewer is hoping to hear. “Where do you draw the line betweenspirituality and our everyday lives?” I reply.It’s an important question, because the artificial separation between scienceand spirit is precisely what keeps us stuck in the thinking that prevents usfrom adapting to today’s crises.“What could be more spiritual,” I ask, “than applying the deepest truthsrevealed by science as the real-world solutions in our everyday lives?”The Crisis of Change ItselfWhen big changes happen in our lives, we tend to view them initially as crises.The previous mention of climate change is a perfect example. When the climate ofthe world began to shift, it caught many people off guard. Although theteachings of different indigenous traditions around the world have warned us forcenturies to expect these changes to occur, and the geological history of Earthclearly shows us that we are “on course” for a cyclic shift in climate, theaverage folks going about the business of their everyday lives simply weren’texpecting it. And it’s no surprise that they weren’t. In the memories of thepeople living today, the weather patterns of the last century or so had becomefamiliar, regular, and predictable. The temperatures and growing seasons for ourfarms and gardens had become as sure as night follows day. Then, suddenly, theyall changed.My wife and I experienced this change personally in the high desert of northernNew Mexico. The area is known for its low humidity, an abundance of sunshine,and generally mild weather. Although rainfall is rare throughout much of theyear, the New Mexico desert has traditionally experienced what the locals callthe monsoon rains in the summer months. Like clockwork, beginning in July eachyear, the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico makes its way north to collidewith the cold, dry air coming across the mountains of Colorado and New Mexico.Each afternoon, when these air masses meet, they create a remarkable display oflightning and massive thunderstorms. Such downpours of rain continue throughoutmuch of the summer. They did, that is, until recently.New Mexico and much of the Desert Southwest is in the midst of a full-blownmultiyear drought. For the first time in the memory of residents who’ve lived inthe area for many generations, local ranchers are being forced to sell off theircattle and local farmers to abandon their crops because they can no longersustain them. For the people and economy of New Mexico, the shift in the weatheris a crisis that’s forcing them to change the way they think and the way theylive.Caught by SurpriseJune 30, 2012, will go down in the record books as the night that took theweather experts by surprise. While meteorologists saw the converging patterns ofheat and moisture on their radar screens, even they were in awe of the size andseverity of the storms that the patterns formed. “The widespread nature of the[radar] image we saw is a very rare occurrence,” said Stephen Konarik, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service. “We would not have beenplanning on that magnitude of event.”21 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en21]The cost of the damage from the storm system that stretched from the UpperMidwest of the United States to the Eastern Seaboard that night was aboutthree-quarters of that from Hurricane Irene (August 2011), one of the worst inU.S. history. Even with the help of approximately 600 utility workers andemergency crews that came from as far away as Texas, Michigan, and Florida,residents would remain without power well into the following week. A local notedhow the storm caught everyone off guard, stating, “I guess it was a realsurprise to everyone, apparently even them.”22 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch04-en22] Bythem, he meant the weather forecasters.While the severity of such storms may come as a surprise to meteorologists andforecasters, to those living close to the cycles of nature it does not. Almostuniversally, ancient texts and indigenous traditions have warned that now isprecisely the time when we can expect to experience tremendous change on manylevels of our lives, including global climate and local weather. They’ve knownthat change was coming, for a simple reason—because it always does.As described in my book Fractal Time (Hay House, 2009), every 5,000 years or sothe cycles of the sun and the position of Earth in space conspire to bring aboutmassive changes in our world, such as the one highlighted by the geologicalstudies described earlier in this chapter. The fact that such changes are nowdocumented scientifically adds to the credibility of our ancestors’ wisdom. Andbecause the changes are based upon cycles that are predictable and simple tocalculate, it’s not difficult to identify when the last great change occurred,and to then calculate when it will appear again. The essence of the changesdescribed by those who have experienced them in the past follows a worldviewthat is straightforward and intuitive. It’s essentially a map of relationshipsthat gives meaning to our time of extremes (see Figure 4.6 on the next page).This map helps us make sense of the underlying reality for the crises we facetoday: When the world changes, we are changed. We are changed as people. We arechanged as communities and societies in the presence of our changing world. Andwhen we see the magnitude of what’s unfolding right now, we can be absolutelycertain that we’re in the midst of a big change in our lives, as are our lovedones, friends, and neighbors. We can also be certain that the changes we’reundergoing are happening quickly. As we find nature being pushed to the limitsof what is possible to sustain life, the extremes are pushing us as individuals,families, and communities as well. They’re pushing us in ways that are sometimesobvious and sometimes subtle.The extremes of life are forcing us to think differently about ourselves andreconsider how we sustain our jobs, careers, health, and relationships. In orderto make sense of the seemingly senseless hardships affecting every facet ofsociety, we’re being pushed to look beyond the wisdom handed down to us by ourparents, and theirs. This is where the message at the core of our most cherishedspiritual traditions—our unity with the world and nature’s cycles—is now takingon new meaning, and new relevance, in our everyday lives.img [images/pg154.jpg]Figure 4.6. This simplified illustration shows how the cyclical changes inEarth’s location in space (tilt, orbit, angle, and wobble) translate to thecyclical changes that drive human civilizations. Source: Deep Truth (Hay House,2011).While our ancestors generally understood the relationships illustrated in Figure4.6, I’m not suggesting that every single member in every age-group of everyindigenous tribe possessed this knowledge. What I am suggesting is that thegeneral theme of cyclical change being driven by Earth’s location in space, andhow this would impact our planet and our lives, seems to have been an acceptedprinciple in our ancestors’ worldview. And it’s easy to see why. Once thewisdom-keepers, ranging from the Maya of the Yucatán and the scribes of ancientEgypt to the students of the Hindu yuga cycles, established the motion of Earthin the heavens, the rest simply made sense.Until being confirmed by the modern science of the mid-20th century, however,this ancestral knowledge continued to be held only by people of indigenouscultures.Now We Know!We humans have a history of embracing change and an amazing track record forsuccessfully turning the extremes of crisis into transformation. Geology tellsus that 20,000 to 30,000 years ago the climate of our world changed suddenly—andin a big way. From the preserved bodies of woolly mammoths discovered withremnants of their last bite of food still in their mouths, to the fossils oftropical plants discovered in Antarctica, the geologic record of the earthconfirms that the climate changed dramatically in the past in ways that gave ourancestors little time to adapt. There was nothing in their memory that couldhave prepared them for what was happening or told them what to do. We know thatthey did adapt to the unexpected change and that their ability to do so paidoff. Not only did they survive, but their numbers increased and theirdescendants—our ancestors—migrated throughout the world to populate the land ateven greater levels than before the freeze.More recently, we’ve demonstrated our ability to pull together as a globalfamily to overcome some of the greatest changes of the modern world. Our abilityto rebuild the world economy after the stock market crash of 1929 is a perfectexample of this kind of unity. The unprecedented renaissance that took place inEurope and Japan after the destruction of World War II is another example ofwhat I mean here. The point is that when we’ve faced big problems in the past,we’ve characteristically risen to the call and created the level of cooperationthat was needed to meet the challenge. In times past, however, there was a keydifference.Throughout the greatest shifts in our world, we have typically dealt with asingle crisis, like a collapsed economy, the devastation of a war, or a pandemicdisease. So we know we’re good at meeting the challenge of one crisis at a time.What makes our present-day challenge so very different is that we’re dealingwith multiple crises converging into the same window of time. It’s this factthat makes our era of extremes so different from times past.Unless we think very differently than we have previously, we know withreasonable certainty where the trajectory of the world’s extremes is leading. Tosuccessfully meet the challenge before us, we must answer three key questions.As individuals, as communities, as nations, and as a global family, we must looksquarely into the mirror of our lives and ask ourselves: * How can we solve the issues we face if we’re not honest about them? * Are we willing to accept new discoveries that reveal the deepest truths about our relationship to ourselves and the world? * How do we adapt to a changing world through applying the principles of modern science and spirituality to everyday life?In December 2012, I had the opportunity to pose these very questions to anindigenous healer living in the jungles of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. Once wegot past the barriers of language and translation, the answers came quickly. Hebegan by unrolling a tapestry that he borrowed from a local vendor.A man after my own heart! I thought. I viewed his woven tapestry as the jungleequivalent of the PowerPoint slides that I use to illustrate ideas for myaudiences throughout the world. The image on the brightly colored weavingclearly showed the Mayan Tree of Life. Pointing with his finger, he highlightedthe 13 levels of heaven (the upper world) above the ground, the 9 levels of theunderworld below ground, and the branches and roots of the ceiba (silk cotton)tree, the sacred tree that connects the worlds.While the idea of an upper world and an underworld (or many of them) may atfirst seem to reflect the Christian idea of heaven and hell, there’s oneimportant distinction. In the Mayan tradition, the levels of the underworld arenot viewed as bad places reserved for people who’ve done something wrong. Norare the heavens only for good people who do righteous deeds. Rather, the healerdescribed both the heavens and the underworlds as parts of a continuousexperience.He said that we all experience both the heavens and the underworlds as part ofour great life journey, which is based upon cycles. Driving the cycles ofexperience in all the worlds and everything in our lives is a force that cannotbe represented in a picture. It cannot be represented at all. Because itencompasses everything that exists, it’s beyond description. The name of theforce in Yucatec Mayan is Hunab Ku.This knowledge formed the foundation of the healer’s answer to my question. Heexplained that the key to the wisdom of his ancestors and their knowledge ofchange is that they did not separate themselves from the world, as we have donetoday. They did not separate one experience from another. They did not separateart from science or spirituality from everyday life. From the movements of thestars to the cycles of weather, all aspects of life were viewed as part of themix, as facets of that one continuous experience. Because of this worldview,Mayan wisdom-keepers were able to gain powerful insights into nature’s cycles oftime and change.I listened carefully to what my new friend was saying. It’s been said that theevents of history repeat themselves. It may be that the knowledge of the pastrepeats itself as well, showing up time and again, and appearing in our livesprecisely when it’s needed. It’s this kind of holistic view, describing theinterlocking continuity of all life, that’s now reappearing as the conclusionsof the best science of today. Both science and indigenous wisdom remind us thatwe’re part of all that we see. This means that we’re a part of the solutions aswell. The key is that we must first shift our perspective so we can recognizeour connection.It’s this evolutionary thinking that empowers us to shift away from simplyreacting to our time of extremes, into living the resilience that becomes ourtransformation.img [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE [contents.xhtml#toc_7]THE GOOD NEWS: [contents.xhtml#toc_7]We Already Have the Solutions [contents.xhtml#toc_7]img [images/common1.jpg]“Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution. It forces usto change our thinking in order to find it.”— NIELS BOHR, NOBEL PRIZE–WINNING PHYSICISTIt’s been said that we humans are creatures of habit. Maybe Warren Buffett,paraphrasing 18th-century writer Samuel Johnson, summed it up best when he said,“The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to bebroken.”1 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en1] If we’re honest with ourselves, thesewords are probably just as true today as when Johnson spoke a variation of themover 200 years ago. We are creatures of habit, and it’s for this very reasonthat change of any kind can be hard for us. It’s often easier to hang on to thefamiliar ways of the past—even when those comfortable habits are no longer goodfor us—than to face the uncertainties that the “new” can bring to our lives.Peter Drucker, whose writing has contributed to the model for modern business,says, “Everybody has accepted by now that ‘change is unavoidable.’ But thisstill implies that change is like ‘death and taxes’: It should be postponed aslong as possible and no change would be vastly preferable. But in a period ofupheaval, such as the one we are living in, change is the norm [author’semphasis].”2 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en2] My grandfather would have agreed.Before he died at the age of 96, Grandpa would talk to me for hours about theworld and the way it was in his time. He was born in Eastern Europe at thebeginning of the last century, and as I recounted in Deep Truth, he always beganhis stories by telling me how different the world of his day was from our worldtoday. While I knew that what he was saying was certainly true, each time Ilistened to him share his memories I understood even more just what he meant. Mygrandfather would tell me of a world that I could only imagine: one wherehorse-drawn wagons still had the right of way when they encountered the newlyinvented automobiles, and where many homes had no electricity and telephoneswere rare. It was a world in which there was no network of superhighways, andindoor toilets were a luxury.Grandpa always said that the world stopped making sense to him just after WorldWar II. It was during that time that the new discoveries in science, and changesin everyday life, happened so quickly that he couldn’t keep up with them. Whenthe postwar technology wave produced innovations like jet planes, pocket radios,bar-code scanners, and fax machines, it all simply looked crazy to him. Becausehe could no longer relate to the changes occurring around him, he felt left out,like an outsider in his own world. My grandfather never caught up with moderntechnology. The shift that happened after World War II was the beginning of acrisis for him that lasted until the end of his life.Designed to ChangeThere’s a common thread that binds the world my grandfather knew following WorldWar II and the world we live in today. Both are the product of tremendous changeoccurring in a very brief period. People in both worlds had to shift their modesof thinking and living—and in ways that they had not been prepared for. Perhapsmost important of all, neither world was meant to last forever. The technologyof both was designed to change. For example, the now unthinkably low fuelefficiency of the 1960s “muscle cars,” some of which got less than 10 miles pergallon (mpg), was meant to give way to the more efficient engines of today,which commonly run at 35–40 mpg or more. The portable eight-track tapes of the1970s were meant to give way to the smaller cassette tapes, and then to the CDsthat followed them, and eventually to the pure energy of the electronic 0s and1s of today’s digital era.On a larger scale, the 19th-century power grid of wires and cables that stillconnects our homes, families, and nations today was meant to be temporary. Itwas never meant to last into the 21st century. When inventor Nikola Tesladesigned the system that allows alternating-current power to be carried overlong distances, he did so to provide the people of the world immediate access tothe comforts that electricity could bring into their homes and businesses. Itwas meant to serve them temporarily while he perfected another system that wouldbroadcast energy without burdensome cables and wires, in much the same way thata TV signal is broadcast. For political reasons, Tesla lost his funding and wasnever able to complete his system of wireless electricity. One of the greatestelectrical geniuses of modern times, Nikola Tesla died in 1943, and his“temporary” power grid remains with us today, over a hundred years longer thanit was meant to last.These familiar forms of technology are examples of thinking that were nevermeant to be the ultimate destination of timeless solutions. Rather, they weremeant to be the bridges that would get us to our next steps. It’s this subtleyet profound realization that has helped many people feel a little better aboutour world as it looks like it’s turning upside down. As described in Chapter 4[chapter04.xhtml], the trigger for much of the change today is that the pastways of thinking and living are no longer sustainable. It’s not so much thatthey are wrong or bad; it’s just that we’ve outgrown them. They no longer fitinto our world.Much of the world we’ve known was meant to be a bridge to a better way of liferather than a final destination that was to remain unchanged.The Blueprint for a VisionOn May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy stood before a special session of theUnited States Congress to make an announcement that would forever change thedestiny of America and the course of human history. With these words, the worldshifted: “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safelyto the earth.”3 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en3]With this statement, Kennedy set into motion the massive effort of coordinatingthe technology, corporations, research, and funding that would be needed toaccomplish his goal. Only the building of the Panama Canal during peacetime, andthe super-secret Manhattan Project in wartime, could compare to the depth andscope of Kennedy’s mandate to go to the moon.In what is arguably one of the most impressive displays of military and civiliancooperation ever achieved, Kennedy’s vision became a reality. It happenedprecisely as he had stated, and in less time than he had imagined. In the eightyears between Kennedy’s speech and humankind’s first step on the moon, the planswere created, the propulsion systems were built, the bugs were worked out, andthe space capsule that would carry precious human life went from the draftingtables to the launchpad. On July 16, 1969, the massive Saturn V rocket,measuring 363 feet long and weighing 6.5 million pounds, left the launchpad atCape Kennedy carrying three men to the moon. Five days later, astronaut NeilArmstrong announced the landing with the now-immortal words: “That’s one smallstep for man, one giant leap for mankind.”4 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en4]When people talk about this astonishing feat, one of the first questions theytypically ask is, “How could it have happened so quickly?” How could thematerials have been created, the technology developed, and the systems completedin less than ten years? The answer to this question is the reason I’m sharingthe story here. The success of the mission and the timing were possible becausetwo key factors came together in just the right way.First, the big pieces of the technology were already in place. While theintegration of so many systems and components was a monumental task unto itself,in large part the theories, materials, and communications already existed.That’s why the second factor was so important. While much of the technology wasalready available, no one in a high position of authority had ever made it afocus to bring everything together. When the leader of the most technologicallyadvanced nation on Earth did so through his speech, his words gave thescientists and administrators permission to fall into line. Giving them amandate opened the floodgates of innovation and resources for the exploration ofspace and more. In other words, Kennedy made our journey to the moon a priority.We find ourselves in a similar situation today. Rather than sending humans tothe moon, however, our mission pertains to what’s happening right here on planetEarth. Just as the technology was already available in the 1960s for spacetravel, today we already have the knowledge and the means to alleviate the humansuffering that’s become the hallmark of our time of extremes. We already havethe ability to feed every man, woman, and child living in the world.5[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en5] * Fact: The agriculture of the world produces 17 percent more calories today than it did 30 years ago, enough for at least 2,720 kilocalories per person per day.6 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en6] * Fact: Malnutrition and hunger are not caused by scarcity. Rather, they’re the result of poverty; harmful economic systems; conflict; and to a lesser but growing degree, the droughts, floods, and unpredictable weather patterns resulting from climate change.7 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en7]We already have affordable, clean, and sustainable forms of energy that can bemade available to every household that needs them. The global shift to suchenergy appears to be emerging in gradual stages, rather than instantaneously. * Fact: The first stage of the world’s energy changeover is occurring through the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which burns cleaner, produces 50 percent less CO2, and is more affordable than conventional coal and oil. While it’s not the ultimate solution to satisfying our growing need for energy, it shows a shift in thinking and is a step in the right direction.8 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en8] * Fact: The technology that makes additional forms of “alternative” energy viable is slowly and steadily improving. This includes solar, geothermal, and wind-power technology that can locally supplement conventional power sources, as well as create local resilience to regional energy problems.9 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en9] * Fact: Sources of energy that appear exotic by today’s standards are gradually being implemented to replace fossil fuels altogether and add to a mix of clean and sustainable alternatives that can provide for the needs of our growing population.We already know how to alleviate the abject poverty of the world that has beenthe source of scarcity and suffering. * Fact: The United Nations Millennium Development Goal to reduce the world’s most extreme poverty (of those living on less than US$1.25 per day) is working. The first goal, to halve the proportion of the world’s population who is living in such poverty between 1990 and 2015, was actually met in 2010, five years ahead of schedule. This tells us that real change is achievable and lays the foundation for a push toward an even greater effort.10 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en10]It’s obvious from facts such as these that the elements for big solutionsalready exist. As of this writing, what’s lacking is the kind of vision thatPresident Kennedy provided in 1961, the shift in thinking that makes such goalsa priority.The key to awakening our dreams is to make the object of our vision a priorityin our lives.No Shortage of SolutionsThe examples in the previous section tell us that meaningful change isachievable and doesn’t have to take generations to show up in our lives. The UNhad the resources and the motivation to bring about a meaningful reduction inpoverty for the world in less than 20 years, for instance. So while we know thatsuch change is possible, no one has, as yet, made it a priority to mobilize thevast resources at our disposal and implement similar changes on a grandplanetary scale. In the event that such a visionary declaration was made, theexisting solutions could quickly bring an end to the many and diverse forms ofsuffering in our families and communities. In the absence of such a declaration,we find ourselves bearing witness to a world where the solutions that couldbring hope remain hidden away.It’s not unusual for an audience to gasp in awe when I say that the big problemsof the world are already solved—that is, the problems that technology can solve.Just as the technology for our successful mission to the moon already existedwhen Kennedy made his speech, the solutions to the big problems in our lives—such as social change, creating sustainable communities and cities, andmore—already exist.Although a number of visionary leaders and thinkers have created organizationsand written excellent books to demonstrate what’s possible in our lifetimes,it’s beyond the scope of this book to do justice to them all. For this reasonI’ve chosen a few examples from different fields that illustrate how much efforthas already been directed toward the kind of change I’m talking about. We don’tneed to reinvent the wheel when it comes to knowing where to begin. Other peoplehave already done so, and some have devoted their entire lives to doing thelegwork so that we don’t have to.While I’m not suggesting that any of the following is the only plan of its kind,I’d like you to see the depth and quality of the solutions that are available tous: the plans that have been formulated and the implementation that has beendrafted. The ball is rolling.Now the question is: What are we waiting for?Plan BOne of the leading voices in the effort to educate and mobilize the generalpublic toward a sustainable shift in the way we think and live is the formerhead of the Worldwatch Institute, environmental analyst Lester R. Brown. “We arein a race between tipping points in nature and our political systems,” Brownsays.11 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en11] In a bold attempt to head off thesuffering of our collapsing civilization, he released a series of books designedto illustrate just how bad things were and how much worse they might get. Thebooks all have the same title with different subtitles to show their individualemphases.The first in the series, Plan B: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and aCivilization in Trouble (Norton, 2003), describes the red-flag statistics thatbegan telling us we were in trouble. His third book, Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing toSave Civilization (Norton, 2008), reflects an even greater sense of urgencyabout the dangerous trends further developing in our world. Since the time thathis first Plan B book was published, many of the factors that were only warningsthen have now become the reality of our world.For example, Brown identified how critical times in nature—such as the time whena species’ population is shrinking—mark the point of no return for thatparticular system. Brown then described how a number of related ecologicalsystems on Earth are approaching similar points today.One of the things I like best about the Plan B series is that it containsrealistic action steps that we could put in place immediately to address theissues facing us. Examples of these items include: * Designing cities that support people and the way people live, rather than supporting industries and commuter-based economies * Implementing features that can immediately raise the energy efficiency of homes, offices, commercial buildings, and public transportation * Establishing an economy based on a cyclic use of materials rather than the one-way, linear model that dominates today * Making a shift in government spending (in the United States) that includes reallocating a portion of the massive military budget for use in the building of new, sustainable infrastructureBrown’s Plan B series is a sobering yet necessary assessment that offers thehope of action plans, while also highlighting the problems. Without a doubt,Brown’s work is making a powerful mark on the way we think of our world. Formany organizations, agencies, and individuals, the Plan B series has become abible for identifying potential solutions.Social Change 2.0Just as Lester Brown identified the important issues and offered viablesolutions for the big picture of global change, David Gershon has done much thesame for the institutions that drive such change and societies themselves.Gershon is an accomplished author of a number of consciousness-raising books,including Low Carbon Diet (Empowerment Institute, 2006), which won the bronzeIndependent Publisher “Most Likely to Save the Planet” Book Award in 2007. InSocial Change 2.0 (High Point/Chelsea Green, 2009), he does a masterful job ofdrawing upon his expertise, with a background that extends from academia toserving as an advisor to the United Nations and the Clinton White House.From these personal experiences, Gershon has been able to identify the reasonswhy so many attempts to solve social problems, ranging from inner-city to globalissues, have hit a dead end. It’s because the solutions are based upon ideasthat have proved to be faulty. From his perspective of systems theory, Gershonthen describes how the social crises that we see today are the signals tellingus, “We are being called to reinvent not only our world, but also the process bywhich we achieve this reinvention.”12 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en12]One of the many reasons I was drawn to Gershon’s book is that, like Brown, heoffers his readers real-world alternatives to traditional models of socialchange. These are the time-tested and proven methods that speak to the needs oftoday’s societies and the transformation they’re undergoing. He shares examplesof what he’s learned in a way that could become a template for creating positivechange in almost any social setting, from a small community to an entire nation.After describing his work in facilitating the positive conversations betweenlocal officials and community members in a number of large American cities, forexample, he shares meaningful steps for applying what he’s found in a variety ofsituations. His principles and action steps include: * Making changes in communities that are relevant to people’s lives * Organizing citizens to take greater responsibility for issues like health, safety, and beautification, among others * Empowering local civil servants to take greater responsibility and accept greater accountability for the changes that are affecting their neighbors and families * The design and implementation of a whole-systems approach to community changeWhen something is true in our lives, I am not surprised to see that truth showup time and again in many places. This is certainly true for Social Change 2.0.There is an overlap between many of the ideas that Gershon identifies in hisbook and the principles of Brown’s work, as well as the futuristic communitiesenvisioned by innovators such as Paolo Soleri, which are designed to integratesustainable architecture with the ecology of the land the structures are builtupon.Arcology and EarthshipsIn 1970, something amazing and beautiful began to happen in the arid desertnorth of Phoenix, Arizona. A visionary architect began to build a communityunlike any other anywhere else on Earth. The man’s name was Paolo Soleri(1919–2013), and the kind of community environment that he envisioned is aperfect example of the urban housing that’s needed in our time of extremes. It’sperfect because it’s designed to help large numbers of people adapt to theshifts taking place in our world, both natural and human-made. A student ofrenowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright, Soleri named his community Arcosanti. Hebased it upon a principle that is best described in the community’s own words:“Arcosanti is an urban laboratory focused on innovative design, community, andenvironmental accountability. Our goal is to actively pursue lean alternativesto urban sprawl based on Paolo Soleri’s theory of compact city design, Arcology(architecture + ecology).”13 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en13]Using a combination of otherworldly aesthetics and solid engineering principles,Soleri based the design of Arcosanti on the theme of working with the land andthe elements of nature, rather than by forcing the land to accommodate our ideasabout homes, schools, and offices. What this means in real life, for example, isthat a rock cliff located in the place where a home will be built becomes thewall of a living room rather than being sheared down to the bedrock toaccommodate sheetrock and plywood.One of the fundamental ideas of arcology is to adapt to whatever it is thatnature offers. In the case of Soleri’s community, one of those elements issunlight. Arizona’s deserts are known for their abundant, high-quality light,which lends itself to solar-energy technology of all kinds. Arcosanti wasdesigned to be a self-sufficient and sustainable community of 5,000 people whowould derive all their energy needs from various forms of solar power. The TwoSuns Arcology module of the Arcosanti village is a system of collection,transmission, and consumption of solar energy, which incorporates both activeand passive solar energy to provide for the village’s needs. A massive system ofterraced greenhouses accumulates the heat of the sun, which is then redirectedto other buildings for their heating and cooling needs. I’ve had the opportunityto experience some of Soleri’s constructions, and I remember wondering at thetime why we weren’t incorporating ideas like his into the homes and cities ofthe modern world to begin with.Another visionary design for self-sustaining communities also has its roots inAmerica’s Desert Southwest. It’s a community in the high desert near Taos, NewMexico, that was established in the 1970s. It was during that decade thatarchitect Michael Reynolds began building an entire community that was “off thegrid,” requiring no public utility connections for electricity, sewage, orwater. The construction was based upon the use of traditionally discardedmaterials, such as aluminum cans, glass bottles, and rubber tires for the walls.These were covered with stucco plaster to form beautiful and veryorganic-looking structures. He named the homes and offices he was constructingEarthships, in part because he literally used earth—the local dirt—in theirconstruction.The use of the soil came about in different ways. One of these was called rammedearth. It’s precisely what it sounds like: the piling and ramming of soilagainst specially prepared foundations and walls of buildings, effectivelymaking them partially buried. The insulating and acoustic-deadening effect oframmed earth is unmatched in traditional construction. These homes and officesare warm and quiet!The second way the dirt was used involved packing it into old rubber tires toform some of the walls, especially on the northern exposure, where there was nowarmth from direct sunlight. The density of the packed earth made each tire intoa perfect round brick with a space of dead air at the center, providing anenormously high insulation effect against the heat and cold of the desertextremes.Each Earthship uses the south-facing glass walls to allow the desert sunlight toradiate into the building and heat the clay brick or flagstone floors during theday. After the sun goes down at night, the bricks continue to radiate their heatevenly and effectively throughout the house. I’ve been in Earthship homes wherethe indoor temperature in December hovers around 80°F, and remains stable wellinto the night. Each home is equipped with a self-contained system to collectthe used water from the home and filter and recycle it to water the trees,flowers, and vegetable gardens that are grown outside, as well as in thebuilding’s atrium.img [images/common2.jpg]Whether these specific designs are ever used on a larger scale is a questionthat remains to be answered. The reason I’m sharing them here is because thesecommunities, and others that are already functional in other parts of the world,are the laboratories that inform us as to what’s possible when it comes torethinking our neighborhoods and even entire cities.As we rebuild after the devastating effects of climate change, such as the EF5tornado that leveled the city of Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013 and category 3Hurricane Sandy that destroyed entire communities on America’s Eastern Seaboardin October 2012, the sustainable principles demonstrated by these visionarycommunities may provide the flagship models for how we construct the cities ofthe future.Global ShiftEveryone learns a little differently. For precisely this reason, many very goodteachers have written very good books regarding our time of extremes. While theperspectives of some books are oriented toward the big picture and how thechanges in our lives translate to changes in the world, others acknowledge theserelationships while focusing more on integrating change in our personal andspiritual lives. Edmund J. Bourne, Ph.D., has written one such book, GlobalShift: How a New Worldview Is Transforming Humanity (New Harbinger, 2008). Twoelements of this book drew me to it and made it one of my favorites on thissubject.The first element of the book that I like is how Bourne integrates leading-edgescience with indigenous traditions, spirituality, and the realities of everydaylife to paint a picture of the new world that’s emerging. Rather than asking usto accept a single perspective as the perspective, he paints an honest portraitof the real world as one in which people are searching for a new worldview thatmakes sense, and most important, that works.Within the context of an emerging worldview, he dedicates an entire chapter ofthe book to taking action. I found this chapter rich in ideas and resources thatcould help us embrace the promise of the book’s title. Among the familiarsuggestions that I’d expect to see in such a book, such as lifestyle changes,environmental conservation, and community charities, Bourne also identifiesthings we can do in our financial lives that reflect the economic shiftshappening in our daily realities. These suggestions include: * Socially responsible ways to invest our money * Innovative ways to invest in our communities * Conscious ways to invest in the world’s financial marketsWhile it’s not likely that we would implement all the changes in Bourne’s bookat once, by the end of it we’ve gained a solid grasp of the magnitude of theshift that’s unfolding in our lives, and we have ample ideas for solid actionsthat could make our experience of the global shift a little smoother.It’s clear that no single source of information or single idea is the answer tothe critical choices that we’re making in our lives today. Rather, there aremany different solutions to many facets of many issues that are all appearing atthe same time. Bourne sums this up beautifully, saying, “None of us can solvethe immense problems the Earth and its people face alone.”14[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en14]My reason for sharing examples of thinking like Bourne’s, and the otherspreviously mentioned, is to show that the ideas already exist and the wheels arealready in motion to help us handle the global shift. As Bourne writes, “Each ofus, by engaging in a few simple actions to help the environment anddisadvantaged people, can make a contribution and potentially influence otherswe know to do the same.”15 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en15]img [images/common2.jpg]I’ve met people who think of our era as a time of frightening urgency as well.Once they recognize the extremes, their reaction is that we must act and dosomething immediately. Now! While it’s a natural reaction to want to spring intoaction as soon as possible, my feeling is that we’re living in what I like tocall the zone of graceful urgency. It’s graceful in the sense that we still havethe time to do what it takes to avoid the tipping points of climate change, peakoil, and peak debt, and the dire consequences so many of the experts arepredicting. There’s urgency in the sense that now is the time to respond.Whatever we’re going to do, whatever shifts we’re going to make in our world,and whatever changes we’re going to implement in our lives, now is the perfecttime for those adaptations and innovations.We already have solutions to big problems, such as food, energy, and asustainable economy. Our problem is a crisis in thinking.What Will It Take?It’s clear from the studies, reports, and messages from organizations andauthors described in the previous section that we have the foundation for realsolutions that can make the world better and our lives easier. It’s also clearthat we have the ability to implement those solutions now. So the obviousquestions are: Where are these solutions today? Why aren’t we using them now?What will it take before we do?The answer to our questions is illustrated in President Kennedy’s visionary planto go to the moon. Something else had to happen first, beyond giving the mandateto put a man there. Before he could go to the American people with his ideas,before the technology could be designed, before any trajectories from thelaunchpad to the moon could be calculated, before any spacesuits could bedesigned or the Tang breakfast drinks could be sealed into space-worthypouches—before any of these things could even begin to happen—something else hadto happen first. That “something” is what’s missing in our lives today.It’s a shift in thinking.It’s fair to say that the greatest crisis of our time of extremes, beyond thecrises of debt, energy, and food, is a crisis of thinking. It’s our thinkingthat would make the lifesaving solutions we already have a priority in our dailylives, and motivate us to implement those solutions in the world. The thinkingwe need would come from a deep-seated desire to contribute to the world, ratherthan from a sense of scarcity and taking from the world; and from cooperatingwith one another, rather than competing against one another.This very style of thinking is now supported by the new discoveries and the bestscience of our time. So, to answer the question of What would it take to bringthe solutions that already exist into our lives? let’s begin at the beginning:Where did the thinking that has led us to the greatest crises in 5,000 years ofhistory really come from? The answer may surprise you.Rethinking the False Assumptions of ScienceThere’s a story buried deep in our culture that plays a huge role in oureveryday lives. It’s the usually unspoken story of us: who we are, where we comefrom, and how things seem to work in our world. I’m not suggesting that thisstory is necessarily something we routinely think about, or even one that we’reconscious of. It’s not a story that we share at the breakfast table with ourfamilies each morning or contemplate while we go about our rituals to preparefor the day. For many of us, it’s a story that’s buried so deeply in the way wethink and act that we accept its consequences automatically without a secondthought. Although it may be buried, it remains so present with us that it guidesour choices and affects the way we respond to our loved ones, co-workers, andfriends—and to the world—each and every day.It’s a story of separation.No Shortage of SolutionsSince the birth of modern science nearly 300 years ago, the story of our liveshas been that we’re little more than specks of dust in the universe andbiological sidebars in the overall scheme of life. We’ve been led to believethat we’re separate from one another. We’ve been taught that we’re essentiallypowerless when it comes to the healing of our own bodies or our ability toinfluence peace in our communities and beyond.Our story of separation includes Charles Darwin’s belief that life is a struggleand we must fight for the good things that come to us in life. As children, manyof us were conditioned to think this way through the mantra that we live in a“dog-eat-dog” world. The very phrase embodies the belief that the world is likeone big, limited, finite pie, and therefore we must struggle and fight for ourslice of the pie or miss out forever. This is the basis for the popularworldview of scarcity or lack, and the need we perceive for violent competitionbetween people and nations. It may be no coincidence that during the time we’veheld this view, the world has found itself facing the greatest crises of war,suffering, and disease in recorded history.Is it any wonder that we often feel powerless to help our loved ones andourselves when it comes to life’s great crises? Is it any wonder that we oftenfeel just as helpless when we see our world changing so fast that it’s beendescribed as “falling apart at the seams”? At first blush, there seems to be noreason for us to think any differently or to believe we have any more controlover ourselves or where our lives are heading than this worldview indicates wedo. After all, there’s nothing in our traditional textbooks or traditional wayof seeing the world that allows for anything else. That is, until we takeanother look at certain discoveries made during the last years of the 20thcentury.Although the results of paradigm-shattering research have been published inleading technical journals, they’re often shared in the complex language ofscience, masking the power of their meaning from those outside the scientificcommunity. Average nonscientific, nontechnical people don’t feel the impact ofthe new discoveries because they’re being left out of the conversation.The latest discoveries in the fields of biology, physics, archaeology, andgenetics are forcing scientists to rewrite the story of who we are and how wefit into the world. In biology, for example, the publication of more than 400studies showing that nature is based upon a model of cooperation, rather thanDarwin’s “survival of the fittest,” has turned the thinking of evolutionaryscience upside down. In light of such discoveries, and others, some keyassumptions of the past—now recognized as the false assumptions of science—canno longer be taught as fact. Examples of these include the following: * False Assumption 1: Nature is based upon survival of the strongest.16 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en16] * False Assumption 2: Random events of evolution explain human origins.17 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en17] * False Assumption 3: Consciousness is separate from our physical world.18 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en18] * False Assumption 4: The space between physical things is empty.19 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en19] * False Assumption 5: Advanced civilization began 5,000–5,500 years ago.20 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en20]While knowing about such discoveries would be interesting at any time in ourlives, they’re absolutely vital to us in this time of extremes because the waywe solve the problems of our lives is based upon the way we view ourselves inrelationship to the world. When we think about everyday life—the way we care forourselves and our families, how we solve our problems, and the choices wemake—it’s plain to see that much of what we accept as common knowledge is rootedin core beliefs based in these false assumptions.Rather than following the scientific imagery portraying us as insignificantbeings that originated through a miraculous series of biological “flukes” andthen survived 5,000 years of civilization as powerless victims separate from theharsh world we’ve found ourselves in, the new science suggests somethingradically different. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, peer-reviewed scientificstudies revealed the following facts: * Fact 1: Advanced civilization is at least twice as old as the 5,000–5,500 years estimated by conventional timelines.21 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en21] * Fact 2: Nature relies upon cooperation and mutual aid, not competition, for survival.22 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en22] * Fact 3: Human life shows unmistakable signs of design.23 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en23] * Fact 4: Our emotions directly influence what happens in the sea of energy we are bathed in.24 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en24] * Fact 5: The universe, our world, and our bodies are made of a shared field of energy—a matrix—that makes the unity known as entanglement possible.25 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en25]Albert Einstein is reported to have said that “insanity” is doing the same thingover and over again in the same way and expecting different results. I thinkthere’s a lot of truth in this statement. To attempt to resolve the challengeswe face in our time of extremes by looking at them through the eyes of the samebeliefs that led to the crises makes little sense. To do so now, particularlywhile knowing that those beliefs are false, makes even less sense.To meet the challenges of our time of extremes, we must be willing to thinkdifferently about ourselves than we have for the last three centuries. And to doso means that we must cross some of the traditional boundaries that haveisolated the discoveries in one area of scientific study from those in another.When we do, something wonderful begins to happen.The Broken Chain of KnowledgeThere is a chain of knowledge that links our modern world with the past. Eachtime that chain is broken, we lose access to valuable information about theworld and ourselves. We know that the chain has been broken at least twice inrecorded history: once with the burning of the Great Library of Alexandriaduring the Roman conquest of Egypt, and then again with the edits of the Bibleby the Christian church hierarchy during the 4th century C.E. As a scientist, Iam of the opinion that the closer we can get to the original teachings thatexisted before the knowledge was lost, the more clearly we can understand whatour ancestors knew in their own times that we could apply in ours.For the bulk of my adult life, I’ve searched the places least disturbed by themodern world to find sources of ancient and indigenous wisdom. My journey hastaken me to some of the most amazing sites remaining on Earth. From themagnificent monasteries of the Tibetan Plateau and the humble monasteries in themountains of Egypt and southern Peru, to the Dead Sea Scrolls and the oralhistories of native peoples throughout the world, I’ve listened to stories andstudied records. As different as each of the traditions I’ve encountered appearsto be from the others, there are common themes weaving them into a collectivefabric that displays our past. Those themes are reflected in the wisdom sharedby the Mayan elder I met in Mexico’s Yucatán jungles in fall 2012. In summary,he described how our ancestors did not separate . . . * . . . themselves from the world around them. * . . . art, science, and everyday life. * . . . the present from the past.While such wisdom is certainly not scientific, the themes that the wisdomconveys have, in fact, been confirmed by the best science of our time. In lightof such confirmations, the question that comes to me again and again is this: Ifour ancestors had such a deep understanding of the earth and our relationship toit, and modern science is only just now able to validate this relationship, thenwhat else did they know that we’ve forgotten?The Question at the Root of Each ChoiceA single question guides us throughout each day of our lives. For some people,the question is subconscious, while for others it’s not. Either way, our answerto this question is the key to every decision we’ve ever made in our lives, orwill make from this moment forward. Our answer provides the basis for each andevery choice we’ve ever arrived at and is at the heart of every challenge that’sever crossed our paths. The question is such a simple one that many people makethe mistake of discounting its meaning in their lives. The question that holdssuch power for us as individuals is simply this: Who am I? And because there areso many of us in the world today making big choices, the question also becomes:Who are we?For over 5,000 years, the ancient and indigenous people of the world answeredthis question in a way that worked for them. Their worldview gave them thereasons to live in harmony with the earth, rather than to attempt to master it.It gave them reasons to work together as communities and form regional councilsthat worked to share the resources of the planet, rather to attempt to own them.With the birth of the scientific method, during the time of Sir Isaac Newton,all of that began to change. Since then, for over 300 years, science has triedto prove empirically what the indigenous traditions of our past accomplishedintuitively. During this period, the story of separation and the need forcompetition has become so deeply ingrained in our worldview that we sometimesfail to realize what a huge role it plays. Nonetheless, it’s the thinking of thepast that’s led to the crises we face in our lives today.To answer the question of who we are means we must first answer six fundamentalquestions regarding our relationships to ourselves and the world. They must beanswered by every civilization, every society, every religious organization, andmembers of groups from each spiritual tradition in order to meet the needs ofthose who participate in the organization or follow the group’s teachings. Thequestions address the most fundamental issues of existence.Figure 5.1 on the next page illustrates how these ideas fit with one another,forming a pyramid of thinking. The questions they pose make sense intuitivelyand form a hierarchy of increasingly complex relationships. Beginning with themost fundamental question of all, from the bottom of the pyramid they are: 1. Where does life come from? 2. Where does human life come from? 3. What is our relationship to our bodies? 4. What is our relationship to our world? 5. What is our relationship to our past? 6. How do we solve our problems? [We ask this last, because the way it’s answered depends upon the thinking that answers the previous questions.]img [images/pg181.jpg]Figure 5.1. An illustration of the pyramid of thinking. The way we answer thesix fundamental questions shown vertically in the center of the pyramid formsthe lens through which we see ourselves in the world and think of ourselves inlife. The false assumptions listed to the left are based upon 300 years ofscience and the belief in separation. To the right are the new assumptions basedupon the best science of today, which reveals a world of unity and our role init. It’s the principles of this lens that determine how we go about solvingproblems in our lives, in our families and communities, and even betweennations. Source: Deep Truth (Hay House, 2011).On the left side of the pyramid, we see the false assumptions of science. Thesesix assumptions encapsulate an entire paradigm of thinking that has formed thefoundation of our story in the modern world. It’s these very beliefs ofseparation and competition that have been at odds with leading-edge discoveriesthat began appearing at the end of the 20th century. With the acceptance ofthese now-obsolete beliefs, Darwin’s ideas of competition make perfect sense.The problem is that the new data no longer supports the old theories.The way we think of ourselves in the world creates the lens through which wesolve our problems.Dangerous ThinkingIt’s common for participants in my seminars to ask why it matters that theassumptions of the past are wrong. Charles Darwin’s ideas offer a perfectexample. They were first introduced in the mid-1800s, and we’re now in the 21stcentury. Honestly, why is it important?These are good questions, and the answers surprise many people. It’s preciselybecause so many of the false assumptions of science came into being when theydid that they’ve had the impact they had on our world. Because so many of thesefalse assumptions were introduced in the late 1800s and early 1900s—preciselywhen the foundation for our modern way of life was put into place—it’s notsurprising to see these principles reflected in so many aspects of our worldtoday. During this time, the propositions put forth by the science of the day,such as the belief that there is no field of energy that connects the world(everything is separate from everything else) and the belief that nature isbased upon competition and survival of the strongest, were quickly accepted andapplied to the thinking about war, economies, and the way we solve our problems.In ways that are sometimes subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, these falsebeliefs are still with us today. For example, studies from experts, such asUniversity of Illinois archaeologist Lawrence H. Keeley, author of War BeforeCivilization (Oxford University Press, 1996), contribute to the acceptance ofwar as a normal expression of human behavior. Based on his scholarly explorationof our past and his interpretation of the evidence he’s found, Keeley’s opinionis that war is a natural state of human affairs. “War is something like trade orexchange,” he says. “It is something that all humans do.”26[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en26] This type of thinking, which embracescompetition, struggle, and “survival of the strongest” as natural elements, isreflected in the administrative structures of the big systems that are in crisistoday. The world’s economic system, the business models of many moderncorporations, and the way in which we manage vital necessities of food andenergy are all examples of modern consequences of an obsolete way of thinking.These false beliefs are with us in ways that are less subtle as well. Some ofthe greatest suffering of the 20th century was justified by the ideas ofsurvival of the strongest. The thinking implied in all forms of genocide, anddirectly spelled out in some, is linked to Darwin’s observations of nature, theway he portrayed it in his writings, and how these writings were interpreted byothers. This thinking is mirrored in philosophical works such as the infamous“Little Red Book” (officially titled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung) andin Mein Kampf, the book that detailed Adolf Hitler’s worldview. Both books wereused as justification for brutal killings that took a combined toll of at least40 million in the last century.Nature’s Model: CooperationIn the opening address at the 1993 Symposium on the Humanistic Aspects ofRegional Development, held in Birobidzhan, Russia, co-chair Ronald Logan offereda context for viewing the new discoveries of cooperation in nature as a modelfor successful societies. Logan cited the work of Alfie Kohn, author of NoContest (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), describing what Kohn’s research revealsregarding a beneficial amount of competition in groups. After reviewing morethan 400 studies documenting cooperation and competition, Kohn concludes: “Theideal amount of competition . . . in any environment, the classroom, theworkplace, the family, the playing field, is none. . . . [Competition] is alwaysdestructive.”27 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en27]The natural world is widely recognized as a proving ground for experiments inunity, cooperation, and survival among insects and animals. From nature’slessons we’re shown, without question, that unity and cooperation areadvantageous to living beings. Such time-tested strategies from the world aroundus may ultimately lead us to develop a new blueprint for our own survival. Toapply a strategy of cooperation, however, an additional factor must be accountedfor in our world that does not appear in the animal kingdom. As individuals, andas a species, human beings generally must know “where” we are going and what wecan expect when we get “there,” before we are willing to change the way we live.We need to know that the result is worthwhile and something to look forward to.Clearly, we don’t know all that there is to know about how the universe worksand our role in it. While future studies will undoubtedly produce greaterinsights, it’s sometimes best to make choices based upon what we know in themoment—so that we can live to refine them later.Will We Embrace What Science Has Revealed?A powerful voice in the scientific community, Sir Martin Rees, professor ofastrophysics at the University of Cambridge, suggests that “the odds are nobetter than 50/50 that our present civilization will survive to the end of thenext century.”28 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en28] While we’ve always had naturaldisasters to contend with, a new class of threats that Rees calls “humaninduced” now have to be taken into account as well.Emerging studies, such as those reported in Scientific American’s “Crossroadsfor Planet Earth” edition, echo Rees’s warning, telling us, “The next 50 yearswill be decisive in determining whether the human race—now entering a uniqueperiod in its history—can ensure the best possible future for itself.”29[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en29] The good news the experts almost universallyagree upon, however, is that “if decision makers can get the framework right,the future of humanity will be secured by thousands of mundane decisions.”30[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en30] It’s in the details of everyday life that the“most profound advances are made.”31 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en31]Without a doubt, each of us will be asked to make countless decisions in thenear future. I can’t help thinking, however, that one of the most profound, andperhaps the simplest, will be to embrace what the new science has shown us aboutwho we are and our role in the world. If we can accept, rather than deny, thepowerful evidence that the individual sciences are showing us, then everythingchanges. With that change we can begin anew.While for some people the possibilities hinted at by new discoveries are arefreshing way to view the world, for others they shake the foundation oflong-standing tradition. It’s sometimes easier to rest on the false assumptionsof outdated science than to embrace information that changes everything weunderstand. When we do, however, we live in the illusion of a lie. We lie toourselves about who we are and the possibilities that await us. We lie to thosewho trust and rely upon us to teach them the latest and greatest truths aboutour world.When I share this irony with live audiences, often the response echoes thewisdom of science-fiction author Tad Williams, who wrote: “We tell lies when weare afraid . . . afraid of what we don’t know, afraid of what others will think,afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, thething that we fear grows stronger.”32 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en32]When the discoveries of today tell us that the teachings of the past are nolonger true, we must make a choice. Do we continue teaching the false principlesand suffering the consequences of wrong assumptions? If we do, then we mustanswer an even deeper question: What are we afraid of? What is it about knowingthe deepest truths of who we are, our origins, and our relationship to oneanother and the earth that’s so threatening to our way of life?Figuring this out may become the greatest challenge of our time in history. Itforces us to answer the big question that is uncomfortable for some people andthreatening for others: Can we face the truth that we have asked ourselves todiscover? Do we have the courage to accept what the best science of todayreveals about who we are in the universe, and how we fit into the world? If theanswer is yes, then we must also accept the responsibility that comes withknowing we can change the world by changing ourselves.Our willingness to accept the deep truths of life is the key to whether or notour children will survive our choices and have the opportunity to explore thenext deep truths discovered in their lives.Reluctance to reflect new scientific discoveries in mainstream media,classrooms, and textbooks keeps us stuck in the thinking that has led to thegreatest crises of human history.The Catalyst: People and More PeopleClearly, the biggest catalyst for change in our world is the sheer number ofpeople who now share the earth, and finding the ways to meet their daily needs.In 1968, biologist Paul Ehrlich and his wife, Anne, released their soberingassessment of what we can reasonably expect from the growing numbers of peoplein our global family. Three sentences early in their powerful book ThePopulation Bomb (Sierra Club/Ballantine, 1968) say it all: “The battle to feedall of humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people willstarve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this latedate nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.”33[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en33]The authors have stated that the purpose of their book was first to create anawareness of the problems stemming from the world’s growing population, and thento call attention to the suffering that was inevitable if the growth trends anddemand for resources continued. While the book was criticized for its unsettlingpredictions of human suffering and mass starvation, the authors believe thattheir book actually achieved the goal that led to its writing. “[It] alertedpeople to the importance of environmental issues and brought human numbers intothe debate on the human future,” they stated recently.34[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en34] In a follow-up article, “The Population BombRevisited,” they responded to the criticism by saying, “Perhaps the most seriousflaw in The Bomb was that it was much too optimistic about the future.”35[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en35]In addition to natural cycles of change that we have no control over, arguablythe single greatest factor driving our time of extremes is the very topic thatthe Ehrlichs described in 1968: Earth’s growing population. While the epicsuffering and death they predicted has in fact occurred, it’s happened over aspan covering four-plus decades rather than the compressed period of the 1970sand ’80s they originally projected. The sheer number of people now living in ourworld, the resources needed by each and every one of them each and every day,and their desire for the energy-intensive lifestyle popularized by Westernculture are perpetuating a self-sustaining loop of conditions amplifying ourtime of extremes. We see an example of such a loop developing between thegrowing populations of countries like India and China, which together accountfor about 38 percent of the people in the entire world, and their emergingdemand for energy.As more and more people in these two countries enjoy new levels of prosperityfrom globalization, booming industry, and higher-paying jobs, they’re followingthe Western model of what that kind of success has looked like in the past. Theyaspire to have the same luxuries of multicar families and commuter-basedcommunities that have been identified with affluence in the West since the boomof the post–World War II 1950s.It’s these ideas of affluence and the way they’re expressed that create avicious cycle that demands more energy to power more homes, moreclimate-controlled office buildings, more public transportation, and moreprivate automobiles, which in turn create more opportunities for more people,and so on. The sheer number of private automobiles produced on a global scalegives us an idea of just what such demand means. As recently as 2006, theworld’s automobile industry produced about 50 million new vehicles each year. Inthe space of just six years, however, that number increased to over 60 million.In other words, in just 10 years, 10 million new vehicles per year—approximately165,000 each day—were added to the roads of the world!36[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en36]The problem is that the energy needs created by this modern phenomenon are stillbeing met by the energy thinking of the last century. Gasoline remains thepreferred way to power automobiles.This is where the cycle is pushing against unsustainable limits. Gasoline comesfrom oil. From the increased emissions of greenhouse gases and thehealth-threatening pollution that it produces to the effect of higher-pricedfuel on the world’s economy, the implications of a growing demand for oil areimmense.Whether it was the environmental protests of the 1960s or the scientificwarnings of the 1970s, concerns regarding the world’s population and the factthat the growing number of people is the trigger for greater demands uponshrinking resources are certainly no secret. It may be precisely because we’veheard about the problem for so long, without any meaningful signs of a solution,that we sometimes feel absolutely overwhelmed even thinking about it.Feedback Loop 1: More People/More Energy/More People . . .The statistics for the world’s population tell us that the number of peopleliving on Earth hovered under 500 million for nearly 11,500 years. When we lookat how that number has grown in such a relatively short period of time afterbeing so stable for so long, the question is: Why? What could have driven up thenumber of people living on Earth so quickly? While various factors play a rolein answering this question, including the warming of the climate following thelast ice age and the discovery of agriculture to sustain communities, one factorstands out from all the others. That factor is the undeniable link betweenpeople, energy, and food.The question is, which came first? Was it the growing size of Earth’s populationthat triggered the search for more food and a fuel source that could meetpeople’s energy needs? Or was it the discovery of an abundant and efficientsource of energy that led to the ability to grow more food and the rise in ourpopulation? Depending upon which researcher we ask or what study we reference,there appears to be evidence supporting both scenarios.The dynamic relationship between energy and people is beautifully summed up byCanadian ecologist Paul Chefurka. “It’s obvious at a glance that food, oil andpopulation are tightly related,” he says, “but the nature of their relationshipis open to interpretation.”37 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en37] Describing theperspectives that are possible, he states, “If you were an economist you couldsay that as the number of people grows, we go out and grow more food and findmore oil to meet our growing needs. Conversely, if you were an ecologist youmight say that increasing supplies of oil and food allow our population to grow.Or you could say (as I do) that they all exist in a complex feedback loop.”38[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en38]Regardless of what we conclude has driven the rise in population and energyconsumption, the fact is that the discovery of cheap and accessible fuel sourcesis directly linked with the largest increase in human population in the historyof the world. The first doubling of the world’s population, in 1804, illustratesthis relationship, as it coincided precisely with the rise of coal as a globalfuel source.Coal was so abundant and inexpensive in Europe and North America in the 19thcentury that it quickly became the standard for heating homes, as well as foruse in industry. While it was certainly used as early as the mid-1700s, themining and processing methods and railroads needed to pull the coal from theground and move it in large quantities to where it was needed were still beingdeveloped. It wasn’t until the mid to late 19th century, and even into the firsthalf of the 20th century, that coal became the energy of choice. By the end ofWorld War II, however, the use of other fuel oils, such as crude oil and oilproducts, became safe, efficient, and cheap. Although this led to a decline inthe use of coal specifically as the preferred energy source, it furthered therelationship between people and energy.Today, we find ourselves at a crossroads similar to that involving coal and oilin the last century. This crossroads is triggered by the shrinking reserves ofcheap oil and the new forms of energy that are filling the void. This includesharnessing renewable forms of energy, as well as tapping into mammoth-sizedreserves of natural gas that are turning the energy equation of the world upsidedown. The key here is that the use of inexpensive energy that’s easy to accesscorrelates strongly with the rise in population.img [images/pg190.jpg]Figure 5.2. The growth of the world’s population is closely tied to theavailability of cheap energy. We see this relationship clearly in the parallelbetween the rise in the world’s oil production at the turn of the last centuryand the dramatic increase in population at precisely the same time. Source:International Energy Agency.The use of cheap energy gave our forebears more time for leisure activitiesbecause their focus shifted away from survival. And it’s this higher standard ofliving that led directly to the explosion in population. To put such growth intoperspective, between 1926, the year Elizabeth II was born, and 2013, the queenof England witnessed the population of the earth rise from 2 billion to 7billion. The marriage between people and cheap energy that began 200 years agocontinues as our global family now is projected to reach 8 billion to 10.5billion by 2050.39 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en39]Feedback Loop 2: More People/More Food/More People . . .In the same way that the world’s population is linked to energy supplies, thefood needed to feed our global family is also directly linked to energy. When wethink about the way our food is produced today, intuitively this relationshipmakes tremendous sense. As the population of the world has increased, the demandfor food has followed. With the development of farm equipment powered by cheapoil in the 20th century, farmers could produce more food in shorter periods oftime to feed greater numbers of people.As a young boy growing up in the Midwestern United States, I clearly rememberthe signs along Interstate 70, a part of the country’s emerging highway system,which informed us when we were crossing the border between states. During ourfrequent drives between Missouri and Kansas, in addition to the colorful plaquesthat told us we were crossing a state line, there was an additional sign thatproudly displayed how much the agriculture of the state contributed to ourcountry. The sign was updated each year to reflect the shifting conditions ofweather and the availability of water. It became a family game to guess what thenumbers would be before we got to the sign, and the winner would buy the familya soft drink at the next rest stop.In the early 1960s, the sign read: ONE KANSAS FARMER FEEDS 26 PEOPLE. In 2010,the same sign read: ONE KANSAS FARMER FEEDS 155 PEOPLE. The information inFigure 5.3, from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),confirms on a global scale what the Kansas sign was showing on a local scale.The world’s ability to produce greater amounts of food with fewer farmers is atrend that seems to be well established. It’s also the source of what appearsfor some people to be a conflict of information.On the one hand, the data tells us that we’ve got enough food for every mouth onthe planet. On the other hand, we’re inundated with requests for aid to feed themasses of people suffering from starvation in multiple countries on a dailybasis. Clearly, the problem is not with the amount of food available; it’s ingetting the existing food to the people who need it. The term for this dilemmais food insecurity. Entire organizations have been created in an effort to bringan end to this issue.In 2010, the FAO released their annual report identifying the state of the worldand progress made toward creating greater food security. They estimated thatnearly a billion people in the world were chronically undernourished, despitethe first decline in the rate in 15 years.40 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en40] Mostof the people identified as undernourished in this study lived in developingcountries. The conclusion of the report is similar to what you or I wouldconclude even without having the statistical data to support it: the levels ofundernourishment in the world are “unacceptably high.”41[backmatter02.xhtml#ch05-en41]img [images/pg193.jpg]Figure 5.3. There is a direct link between the increasing population of theworld and the need for more food to feed our global family. This relationship isclearly shown in this graph and also illustrates the fact that food shortagesare not due to production problems. Source: United Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization.So while the number of people being fed by our Kansas farmer has increased about496 percent since the 1960s, the cost of the food produced has increased inpercentages measured in the thousands! For example, in 1960 the average cost ofsix ears of corn was about 25 cents. In 2011, the price for the same six ears ofcorn was $3.00—an increase of 1,100 percent in 51 years! Similarly, the cost ofpotatoes in 1960 was about 39 cents per pound. In 2011, that price had increasedby 1,129 percent to $4.99 per pound. Even adjusted for inflation, such a rise infood costs is staggering.One of the biggest factors contributing to the price surges comes from the costof the energy needed to produce the food. When we think about it, this makessense as well.It takes a lot of fuel to produce our food. It takes energy to drive thetractors to plow and prepare the land and plant the seeds. While the crops aregrowing, it takes fuel to create the electricity to pump water from the well tothe irrigation systems to keep the plants alive. It takes fuel to run thetractors and huge combines at harvest time to gather the produce. It takes fuelto run the conveyors that move, sort, and prepare the produce for market; and ofcourse, it takes fuel to power the vehicles that get the produce from where it’sgrown to our local market.While advances in technology have helped with the efficiency of farm equipment,the improvements are relative. A tractor made in 1980, for example, averagedaround 14.4 miles per gallon of fuel, while those produced in 2000 were only alittle better, averaging about 16.5 mpg. Because it takes so much energy toproduce our food, it’s not surprising that as the end of cheap fuel has arrived,the end of cheap food has arrived as well. Figure 5.4 below illustrates thisrelationship in a way that is clear and, for some, startling. The implicationsare immense.As the growing number of people in the world demand greater amounts of food, andthe cost of the energy to produce the food increases, we are now living a timewhen staples, such as rice and corn, are beyond the reach of a large portion ofthe world’s poorest populations.img [images/pg194.jpg]Figure 5.4. As the world’s reserves of cheap oil continue to shrink, thehigher-priced fuels used to produce agricultural crops are reflected in the costof the world’s food supply. The image above clearly shows this relationship. Theimplications of using cheaper or alternative fuels are obvious. In the absenceof such steps, higher fuel costs effectively render the food unavailable to manypeople. Source: Adapted from IMF—Primary Commodity Prices.It’s obvious that the relationship between population, food, and energy is acomplex one. It’s also clear that it’s difficult to separate one facet of thisrelationship from the others. When we talk about finding successful solutions torelated issues, such as those we’ve explored in this chapter, one of the keys isto go directly to the common denominator that links the problems together. Inour time of extremes, it’s easy to narrow the list of possibilities to thesingle factor that the others hinge upon: our thinking. The crisis in thinkingthat permeates our lives is based in a reluctance to accept the discoveriesrevealed by the best science of our day, such as the role of cooperation innature, and what they mean in our lives.To transform our time of extremes, we must have the courage to heal the crisisof thinking.When the converging crises described by experts and pundits are filtered througha worldview based in the false assumptions identified earlier in this chapter,many believe that we’re on a one-way collision course with an inevitable outcomeof decline and destruction. While scientists and media commentators are verygood at predicting such outcomes—the tipping points of things like peak oil andpeak debt—the fact many experts are missing is that those tipping points neednever appear in our lives.Before every tipping point of no return, nature gives us the opportunity to turncrisis into transformation. This fact is the good news that helps us torecognize opportunities for change when they appear in our lives. It’s also whatmakes the true-life examples of such change, described in the next chapter,possible.img [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX [contents.xhtml#toc_8]FROM TIPPING POINTS TO TURNING POINTS: [contents.xhtml#toc_8]The Power to Choose [contents.xhtml#toc_8]img [images/common1.jpg]“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.”— ATTRIBUTED TO LAO-TZU, 6TH CENTURY B.C.E. CHINESE PHILOSOPHERIn 2008, Tom Stoppard, the renowned Czech-born British playwright, was feelingour time of extremes in a big way. For Stoppard, the sense that so many bigthings were happening in our world all at once left him overwhelmed andconfused—feelings that led to a self-diagnosed case of writer’s block. During aninterview with Reuters, the creator of such classic plays as The Coast of Utopiaand Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead confessed that he felt so overcome byglobal extremes that he didn’t know which direction he should take his work.“So much is in the foreground now, huge, important subjects, that you kind ofgoggle at them,” Stoppard candidly described his dilemma in the interview.1[backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en1] “Shall I do global warming or shall I do Iraq,maybe I’ll do Afghanistan, and nothing gets written,” he confessed.2[backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en2] He eventually overcame his writer’s block and wenton to create more innovative plays, such as Dark Side, written to celebrate the40th anniversary of Pink Floyd’s seminal album The Dark Side of the Moon.Stoppard is not alone in his sense of overwhelm. I’m sharing his story as anexample of what many people say they’re feeling nowadays: they’re stunned by somany big events happening all at once. Conference participants throughout theworld have shared with me a similar sense of helplessness and hopelessness, aswell as awe at how fast their lives and the world are shifting.It’s certainly easy to feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of change. It’s alsohard to see how anything we do as individuals could possibly make a differenceto the world. While I have no doubt that it’s possible for one person to bringbig change to the world in a positive way, I also know that it often takes alifetime, or even the sacrifice of a life, to do so. From Mother Teresa toMahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and John Lennon, poignant examples exist of howone person in the limelight of the world stage can open a door of possibility,vision, and imagination for others. What may not be so obvious, however, is whathad to happen before these people could be such powerful beacons of possibility.Before they were able to shine their messages to the world, they first had to behonest with themselves about their dreams and the choices they would make tobring them to life.The Speed of ChangeWhether we’re feeling the impact of global warming upon our weekly grocery billor the burden of global debt in the form of the loss of jobs in our community,it’s good to be honest with ourselves about what’s realistic for our lives andwhat’s not. People tell me all the time that they want to change the world. Thequestion is: How? Realistically, what can we do as individuals in the face of somany simultaneous crises? How can we turn our time of extremes into a time oftransformation? And how do we share our personal transformation with ourcommunities and loved ones?This is where being honest with ourselves comes in. There are two facts I wouldinvite you to consider: * Fact 1: Honestly, the world’s probably not going to change in the time it takes to read this book. * Fact 2: Honestly, the way you respond to the world can definitely change in the time it takes to read this book.There’s an additional fact that makes facts 1 and 2 true. It’s a fact based inthe science of the natural world and how nature adapts to change. * Fact 3: Nature always makes room for new possibilities and positive change.When it comes to this third fact, our time of extremes is no exception.Many experts and media pundits view the converging crises in the world asinevitable stepping-stones tracing a one-way path to irreversible decline anddestruction. While scientists and media commentators are very good at predictingsuch outcomes, most experts are missing out on the good news that makes thetitle of this chapter possible. There’s a turning point in any crisis when itcan lead to positive transformation; when simply surviving can become joyousthriving. In our lives that transformation is called resilience. In our world,that time is now!In other words, although it appears that we’re on a collision course with theeffects of climate change, peak oil, and peak debt, just as the United Nationsand others suggest, these and other crises can be avoided if we act now. Thequestion is: Will we embrace the resilience from the heart that lead to thegreatest transformation of living and thinking that the world has ever seen? Thefacts suggest we’re about to find out!There’s a time when every crisis can be turned into transformation, when simplysurviving can become thriving. That time is the turning point.Tipping Points: Small Triggers of Big ChangeThere are times in life when the principles underlying things that seem smalland insignificant can make a big difference and lead to big change. A boilingpot of water on the kitchen stove is a perfect example. While we’ve all seenwater boil, we may not have realized precisely what we were seeing as ithappened. And, if we didn’t realize what we were watching on the stovetop, thenwe were probably missing one of nature’s most powerful agents of change when itcomes to our lives as well. Here’s how it works.When we place the pot on the burner, the water doesn’t boil instantly. Instead,it’s a process. What we see at first is a change so slight that it may even looklike nothing’s happening. So we watch and we wait. Degree by degree, the watergets warmer. Our thermometer reads 195°F, then 200°F, then 207°F. At precisely211°F, something extraordinary begins to happen. While the water still lookspretty much like it did when we turned on the heat, there’s something happeningon a subtle level. If we look closely, we see that a few small bubbles haveformed on the inside of the pot. With the rise of just one more degree, from211°F to 212°F, we see a big change. All of a sudden bubbles appear everywherein the pot and the water erupts into full-on chaos. Now our water is reallyboiling, and we can begin cooking our rice or pasta, steeping our tea, or doingwhatever it was that led us to boil the water to begin with.The key here is that a small difference was all it took to push the water to theboiling point. Although the lower temperatures were necessary steps to get tothat point, it was only when the temperature bumped up that one last smallamount that the conditions in the water changed and the water began to boil.That one last degree illustrates the process I’m describing. It’s called thetipping point, and it changes everything.While the term tipping point has been around for a long time in mathematics andsome other circles, it suddenly burst into our everyday vocabulary in the year2000 following publication of Malcolm Gladwell’s book of that name. The TippingPoint is a powerful exploration of what triggers change in society and how thosechanges can ultimately shift our everyday world. Gladwell defines a tippingpoint as the “moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point.”3[backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en3]A small shift can tip the scales of balance in a big way.Tipping points are often used to describe the point of no return when evolvingconditions reach a place or a time that they no longer support the status quo.It’s at this point that the original condition no longer exists, and a new oneappears. This is precisely what happened in our example of boiling water. At212°F, the molecules began to behave in a new way that reflected the newconditions.For the purposes of this book, a tipping point can be thought of as theculmination of conditions that creates a point of no return. And when we talkabout a point of no return, it’s generally not in a good way.Turning Points: Nature’s Answer to Life’s ExtremesWe see tipping points all around us. In the mainstream media, they’re used todescribe conditions that range from how much longer the world’s economies canhold up against the mounting strain of debt, to how many people in the UnitedStates can remain out of work before the taxes that run the nation becomeinsufficient, or how far the relations between Israel and Iran can deterioratebefore war becomes inevitable. By and large, however, the most common use of theterm in recent years is with regard to climate change and what it means to us.How much can global warming increase before we reach the tipping point whereEarth can no longer sustain life? How far can the climate-induced rising foodand energy prices increase before the average household can no longer affordthem? While we’ll discuss these tipping points, and more, in greater detaillater on, the focus here is the idea of tipping points themselves, and the goodnews that comes with them. So let’s get to that good news.As mentioned earlier, before we ever reach a tipping point of no return, natureallows for a shift that leads to a new outcome. The place where the shiftappears is the turning point. The fact that turning points exist stands in sharpcontrast to what we’ve been led to believe about ourselves and the world. In thereal terms of everyday life, it means that there’s always a way out of adifficult situation; there’s always an opportunity to change the path leading toone outcome to a new path with a new outcome.While this fact would be appealing at any time in our lives, it’s vital torecognize it today, when we’re led to believe that our future holds frighteningtipping points in terms of jobs, food, and energy.Regardless of how much we believe we’ve mastered the forces of nature orinsulated ourselves from the elements, the fact remains that we’re a part of thenatural world. We always have been and always will be, and today is nodifferent. To see just how deeply we are linked to nature, we need look nofurther than the power of lunar cycles to influence the menstrual cycle of awoman’s body, the power of day and night to influence our cycles of sleep, orthe power that the lack of natural light has on the incidence of depression andsuicide in places where sunshine is scarce.Even in a world of high-rise offices and apartments, where it’s common forpeople to go for days without touching the earth under their feet or feeling therays of the sun bathing their skin, it’s clear that we’re deeply enmeshed withthe rhythms of nature. And it’s because we are so deeply connected to naturethat it makes perfect sense for nature’s mathematics to be our mathematics aswell.This is good news, because when we find ourselves headed toward an unwantedtipping point, nature gives us a way to set a new course with a new outcome. Inmathematics, nature’s key to change is commonly called an inflection point. Ineveryday life, it’s our now-familiar turning point. The power of the turningpoint is that it allows us to turn away from what is generally an unwantedoutcome.A Turning Point of HopeWe’ve all seen examples of turning points in our lives or those of friends andfamily. They can happen spontaneously, or they may be created intentionally.It’s entirely possible that we’ve experienced both kinds without recognizingwhat we were seeing. So how do we know when one appears?A familiar example of a turning point would be when a friend or family memberundergoes successful surgery to correct a dangerous condition in his or herbody. Whether it’s the removal of a life-threatening tumor or the repair of avital organ, when such things happen, it’s commonly said that the surgery hasgiven our loved one a “second chance.” In other words, rather than continuingthe course of deterioration that was leading to the tipping point of noreturn—the failure of his or her body—it’s the turning point of the procedurethat offers the new lease on life.I witnessed an example of just such a turning point in my family when my motherchose to undergo surgery for a cancerous tumor in one of her lungs in 2000.Apparently she had unknowingly contracted tuberculosis when she was a younggirl. It was never diagnosed at the time, and her body had healed itself with nomedical intervention. The doctors said that the scar created by a TB wound canbecome cancerous if a person lives long enough for the tissue to calcify.Evidently this is what had happened with my mom.While she and I have had many conversations about our bodies’ awesome ability toheal, and Mom has certainly been to enough of my seminars to see the evidence ofspontaneous healings, she was very clear about how she wanted to deal with herown condition. In a late-night conversation on the phone, Mom simply said, “Iknow those healings are possible, but they’re not for me. I just want this thingout of me!”I heard her loud and clear. I supported my mother’s choice and helped her findthe best facilities and doctors possible to honor it.As we made the rounds to evaluate hospitals and university research centers, Momhad the opportunity to personally interview each potential surgeon. She askedher questions to get to know each doctor, and I listened with another set ofears to what the best voices in the field of lung surgery were telling her. Atthe end of each conversation, I would ask one additional question. After all ofMom’s concerns were addressed, I’d shake hands with the doctor, look him or herin the eye, and ask, “What role do you believe that God or a higher power playsin your work?” With only one exception, my question became the cue to end thehandshake, as one by one, each doctor would turn and walk out of the room.It was at the very last interview with the very last doctor on our list at auniversity teaching hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that one surgeon didn’tleave. Instead, when he heard my question, he gripped my hand even firmer andlet out a big belly laugh that surprised me.With a gleam in his eyes, he looked directly into mine, and with a thickEuropean accent that I couldn’t quite identify, he answered my question byasking one of his own. “Who do you think works through these hands to performthe miracles in the operating room?” he said as he raised his arms for us tosee. He let out another laugh, hugged my mom, turned, and walked out of theoffice.I looked at Mom and said, “I think you’ve just found your doctor!”Mom’s surgery was a complete and total success. She has been cancer-free eversince, and has also made changes in her life that help her to stay that way. I’msharing the story here as another example of how a choice in life can become theturning point that leads to good things. For my mother, knowing with absolutecertainty that her body was free of the tissue that threatened her life was theturning point that gave her the freedom to change her routines of diet,exercise, and the way she’d been taught to think and live. It was the choice todo something that matched her belief system, however—having surgery—that was thekey that made these other types of changes possible.Our personal turning points must fit into our own worldview of possibilities.Nature’s Rule: Keep It Simple!Nature is based in simplicity. It only becomes complex when we make it complex.The principles of life and our world can be described with simple ideas usingsimple words. And it’s precisely because nature is so simple that naturalrelationships can be described using simple mathematics. A fractal pattern is aperfect example of what I mean.In the 1970s, a mathematics professor at Yale University, Benoit Mandelbrot,developed a way for us to see the simple patterns of nature that make the world,and everything in it, possible. He called his new way of seeing things fractalgeometry, or fractals. Before Mandelbrot’s discovery, scientists used anotherkind of geometry to describe the world: Euclidean geometry.The old way of thinking was that nature is so complex that it can’t be describedusing one system of numbers. For that reason, most of us have grown up learninga form of geometry that only approximates nature’s patterns. It’s the geometrythat uses perfect lines, perfect squares, perfect circles, and perfect curves.This is why our first drawings of trees may have looked like lollipops on stickswhen we were young artists.The problem is that nature doesn’t use perfect lines and curves to buildmountains, clouds, and trees. Instead, it uses imperfect fragments—a zigzag linehere and a wobbly curve there—that, when taken all together, become themountains, clouds, and trees. These imperfect fragments are fractal patterns.The key is that in a fractal, each fragment, no matter how small, looks like thelarger pattern that it’s a part of. The term that describes these repeatingpatterns is self-similar.It is because nature is made of a few self-similar patterns that appear on manydifferent scales that a CT scan of the blood vessels feeding into the arteriesof our bodies looks like a satellite image of tributaries feeding into theAmazon River. It’s for the same reason that the energy of an electron orbitingaround a nucleus looks so much like a planet orbiting around the sun. Nature ismade of these simple, self-similar patterns that appear again and again atdifferent levels of magnitude.With nature’s simplicity in mind, when Mandelbrot programmed his formula into acomputer, the output was stunning. By seeing everything in the natural world assmall fragments that look a lot like other small fragments, and combining thesesimilar fragments into bigger patterns, the images that were produced did morethan just approximate nature. They looked exactly like nature! And that isprecisely what Mandelbrot’s new geometry shows us about our world. Nature buildsitself from simple patterns.img [images/pg207.jpg]Figure 6.1. In the 1970s, Benoit Mandelbrot used a computer to produce the firstfractal images. The fern leaf on the left and the landscape on the right areboth computer generated by shifting the values of the same simple formula z = z2+ c. Source: Fractal Fern: Dreamstime: © Tupungato; Fractal Terrain: WikimediaCommons: Stevo-88.With these ideas in mind, it’s not surprising that geometry shows us the idea ofa turning point so beautifully as well. In Figure 6.2, we see the illustrationof a turning point. It’s shown as the place where a line that’s moving in onedirection changes shape and begins to move in a new direction. If we follow theline in the illustration from the top toward the bottom of the graph, it forms ashape that dips briefly, levels out, and then begins to trace a new pathdownward.The point where the line on the chart changes its shape represents the place inthe real world that is the subject of this chapter: the turning point. Becausethe change is possible for the line, we can know with certainty that change ispossible for us as well. Our lives are based on the same natural laws. The graphin Figure 6.2 shows us precisely how it happens. While the change on the graphappears as a simple shift in a line, in our lives the change that occurs at aturning point can mean the difference between success and failure, abundance andlack, and even life and death.img [images/pg208.jpg]Figure 6.2. An illustration of nature’s turning point. It’s the place whereenergy moving in one direction, toward one outcome, can change to a newdirection, and lead to a new outcome. Because we are part of the natural world,turning points are available for us as well.An easy way to think of the turning point is to consider the shape of the curvesthemselves. If our two-dimensional graph were to magically becomethree-dimensional, from the upper right portion of the drawing to the turningpoint, the curve is like a cup. It has a concave shape. In other words, it couldhold water if it were available. From the turning point down to the lower leftpart of the graph, the line changes shape, as if a cup has been turned upsidedown. This convex shape could not hold water.The place where the change occurs is the turning point. It’s this area betweenthe two cups where science now confirms what different mystical traditions havetold us for centuries: there is power in the place between!Nature’s simplicity promises that turning points are simple as well.Mystery in the Space BetweenIn many indigenous traditions, it’s understood that the mysterious space betweenthings holds the power of new possibilities. In North American nativetraditions, for example, it’s the space between day and night that’s believed toopen the door to all paths and new outcomes for our lives. When we think aboutwhat the time between day and night represents, we see clear parallels betweenthe native traditions and the power of the turning point.Two times each day, something remarkable happens with respect to Earth’slocation in space and the effect it has upon us. When the evening sun disappearsfrom the sky as it sets on the horizon, the doorway to a mysterious period oftime briefly appears. Although the sun is no longer visible, the sky is stilllight. It’s not really daytime any longer, yet it’s not quite night. It’s thisspace between day and night that was called the crack between the worlds. Thecrack between the worlds appears again at dawn, when the sky is no longer thedarkness of the night, yet hasn’t become the light of day.From the descriptions of ancient Egyptians and Peruvian shamans to those ofhealers from America’s Desert Southwest, the theme of these turning points isthe same. Twice each day, nature gives us a time when our prayers may be offeredwith the greatest potential to shift our lives. In the language of their time,our ancestors shared the power of what nature shows us in Figure 6.2. Turningpoints are the way nature allows for change.The beauty of knowing that a turning point exists is that it holds theopportunity for us to change before we experience something that we don’t wantin our lives.Turning Points: Sometimes Intentional, Sometimes SpontaneousNature recognizes two types of turning points. They come from different sourcesand show up in different ways in our lives. As mentioned earlier, a turningpoint can be spontaneous, such as the time between day and night describedpreviously, while other turning points are intentional. In other words, it’spossible to create a turning point when we need one. This is good news. It meansthat we can create our own turning points in our lives, as well as in our world.We can create them for issues of health, finance, relationships, and career. Wecan create them frequently, or on rare occasions. Each time we do, we embracenature’s fail-safe mechanism, which allows us to avoid the hurt, heartbreak,destruction, and suffering that all too often appear as the result of failing torecognize one of nature’s windows of opportunity.Now that we know what turning points are, the best way to understand how theywork is through real-life examples. The dramatic weight loss of Bill, a man whotipped the scales at over 300 pounds not long ago, perfectly illustrates what Imean.An Intentional Turning PointUnfortunately, the beginning of Bill’s story is something heard far toocommonly. He was unhappy about his weight and had tried popular diets withoutsuccess. Nothing he did seemed to work for him. Bill’s wife, who was alsooverweight, did find success with a weight-loss program that she’d discovered.When Bill couldn’t get similar results, the difference in their lifestyles madetheir relationship a struggle, and she asked for a divorce. The combination ofnot being able to lose the unwanted weight coupled with the potential loss ofhis marriage led to a predictable outcome. Bill felt hopeless, lost, anddepressed. “I began to hate myself for what I was,” he says, “and startedrealizing that I had a lot more I could look forward to.”4[backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en4]Bill rekindled a connection that he had made previously with a weight-losssupport group. Just like the boiling water at the beginning of this chapter, thechanges in his life and weight appeared slowly. As he saw the poundsdisappearing, gradually at first, and then faster, he increased the intensity ofhis workouts. Within seven months, Bill had lost 100 pounds and dropped tenpants sizes. He felt great! He was healthier than he’d been in a very long timeand translated his personal success at transforming his body into becoming aminister in his church, where he could help others.It was during this same period that Bill was severely injured in an automobileaccident. Before help could arrive, he found himself trapped inside his car withmultiple injuries, including broken ribs, a broken shoulder, and damage to hisface. Following his rescue, he was in critical condition for three days and thenwas hospitalized for three more weeks during his recuperation. It was his will,stamina, and improved physical condition working in harmony that set the stagefor his successful recovery.The doctors and paramedics agreed on one thing: if Bill had had the accidentbefore his life change, the sheer weight of his body in the car would havereduced his chances for rescue and even survival. What’s important about thisstory is that it was Bill’s choice to do something about his weight that was theturning point in his life. Because he made the choice to lose 100 pounds, Bill’sturning point was an intentional one.We can create a turning point with a single choice.A Spontaneous Turning PointIn 1928, a Scottish scientist working with bacteria cultures in a laboratorynoticed that something unusual had happened while he was away on vacation.During the time he was gone, some of the cultures had changed in a way that wasunexpected. Just before leaving, he’d set aside some used petri dishes stillcontaining the bacteria to free up work space for a co-worker. When he returned,he noticed that mold had grown in some of those dishes. While the appearance ofthe mold itself was not really so unusual, it’s the way the bacteria werereacting to the mold that caught his attention. The thin film that such bacteriatypically create as they spread across a surface had been killed in the placeswhere mold was present.In other words, the mold had killed the bacteria.The man’s name was Alexander Fleming, and the mold that had “contaminated” hispetri dishes and killed the bacteria contained the powerful antibioticpenicillin. Penicillin was the first discovery of a medicine of its kind thatwould kill only the harmful bacteria in the human body without killing the goodbacteria or the body itself.Immediately, penicillin became the drug of choice for conditions ranging fromskin grafts that are susceptible to staph infections, to sexually transmitteddiseases and myriad infections caused by animals and insects. As powerful asthis “miracle drug” was in its time, however, penicillin was found to be limitedin the way it could be used and how effective it was. It wasn’t long before evenmore powerful forms of penicillin were developed to overcome the limitations.Many of those forms continue to be used today. They include ampicillin,amoxicillin, and dicloxacillin.Fleming’s discovery is a perfect example of a spontaneous turning point. It isspontaneous because he didn’t set out to intentionally create the antibioticbefore he left for vacation. It happened unexpectedly. It was his willingness toaccept and embrace what he had witnessed, however, that made the turning pointpossible. If he had simply ignored the mold, cleaned the petri dishes, andcontinued with the experiments he had started before his vacation, we would beliving in a very different world today. Fortunately for us all, this wasn’t thecase and he embraced a turning point for himself, and for the countless numbersof people throughout the world who have benefited from his discovery.We can embrace a turning point that spontaneously appears in our lives.As different as these examples of turning points appear to be from one another,they both describe real events that changed lives in two very different ways. Inthe case of Bill, the turning point of his weight loss was one that he createdintentionally as the result of a choice that he made. For Alexander Fleming, theturning point of using the mold as a healing agent was spontaneous; he noticedsomething unusual and recognized the meaning of what he had witnessed.These two examples illustrate the ways in which turning points tend to show upin our lives. While there’s nothing unusual about the fact that they exist, thekey to their power is what we do when they appear. The two factors that can givemeaning to a turning point are: * Having the wisdom to recognize one when it appears * Having the strength to accept/embrace what it shows usNow that we know how turning points show up in our lives, the question is, wheredo they come from?Where Does a Turning Point Come From?The source of a turning point can only be one place. It stems from us and themeaning that we give to a direct and personal experience. The key here is thatit is our experience. It’s not something that people from our workplace say theylearned from their favorite reality-TV program, something that our religiousorganizations tell us we should be feeling, or something that our families sayis so because they’ve always accepted it. A turning point can only become realfor us when we’re the ones who have the experience. It’s the result of somethingthat moves us so deeply that we must shift our beliefs to match the facts of ourexperience.Such turning points commonly come to us in one of two ways, or a combination ofthe two. Either: * A discovery changes the way we think and what we believe.or * A paradigm-altering event changes our worldview.It’s through precisely these kinds of experiences that great teachers often helptheir students cross the gap between their limiting beliefs and thepossibilities of their own power. They do so by showing them something or bycreating a paradigm-altering experience for them. Either way, the student mustthen incorporate the lesson into his or her own thinking and beliefs.The Himalayan spiritual master Jetsun Milarepa, an 11th-century yogi, forexample, led his students into a state of consciousness that allowed them tomove their hands through the solid rock that formed the walls of the caves thatwere their “classrooms.” By doing so, the students discovered for themselvesthat they were limited not by the walls of the cave itself, but by their beliefsabout the walls. I’ve experienced these teaching caves personally during mypilgrimages to the Tibetan Plateau. I’ve placed my hands into the impressionsthat the masters’ hands left in the stone. Even the remnants of suchdemonstrations have a powerful effect upon those who see them for themselves. Inmore recent times, a similar effect has been used to teach the students ofmartial arts about their beliefs as well.We’ve all seen the demonstrations of martial artists breaking through a stack ofconcrete blocks with a single blow from a bare hand. While this kind ofdemonstration is definitely dramatic and amazing to see, what’s not oftenobvious to those watching is that the feat is less about the artist’s sheerstrength and will to break the block, and more about belief and the power of themartial artist’s focus.From personal experience, I can share that the secret to breaking the concreteblocks or the stacks of wood that are sometimes used is where the student placeshis or her attention. The martial artist is trained to identify a point in spacejust slightly below the bottom of the lowest block. This point is the key to theentire demonstration. The martial artist isn’t thinking about how hard he or shewill have to strike or how thick the block is. In fact, other than using thebottom of the block as a reference point, he or she isn’t thinking about theblock at all.The whole point of the exercise is that for just an instant, the thoughts,feelings, emotions, and beliefs within the martial artist’s body, mind, and soulare totally focused on a single point in space and time, the point just belowthe block. That’s the rendezvous point in space where his or her hand willcomplete a motion. In that moment of focus nothing else exists, including theconcrete block.Such a demonstration actually meets the criteria for both previously identifiedturning-point sources. The act itself is a paradigm-altering event that changesthe way the person feels about his or her relationship to the world. And thefact that the martial artist accomplished the feat becomes the discoveryproviding the factual evidence that the feat is possible. Both criteria createthe need for a shift in thinking.One Summer, Two Global Turning Points!We’ve all experienced turning points in our lives, although some are morememorable than others. In the summer of 1969, I experienced two turning pointsthat changed my life, and they happened within less than a month of each other!I was on break from school that summer and working on a ranch in southernMissouri. The near-100°F temperature, combined with the near–100 percenthumidity that’s typical at that time of year in this region, pretty much ensuredthat every outdoor activity would be a miserable experience. This was especiallytrue for my main job of “bucking” wire-bound bales of hay onto the back of aslow-moving truck.Walking alongside the vehicle, I was tasked with lifting each 60-pound bale fromthe ground and catapulting it into the truck to be stacked just as the truckarrived at the next bale, where my co-workers and I would repeat the sequence.This went on for hours at a time. I looked forward to dinner each evening notonly to find relief from the dust, insects, humidity, and heat, but also becauseit was the only opportunity to watch the evening news and connect with the restof the world.Turning Point 1: To the MoonThere was a tiny black-and-white television in the dining room where everyone atthe ranch would gather for meals. The TV was in one corner of the room, and thevolume was usually turned so low that we could only guess what the people in thegrainy images were saying. One night, however, that changed. As the drone ofvoices at the table fell silent for the dinner prayer, the words that werecoming from the TV were unmistakable. “That’s one small step for man, one giantleap for mankind,” the voice said.5 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en5]I felt the wave of two very different realities pulse through my body as Ilistened—one from the world that separated us from one another before theannouncement, and one from the world where that separation disappeared, if onlybriefly, afterward. The words were from Neil Armstrong, and his voice wastraveling from the ladder of a fragile spacecraft on the surface of anotherworld, across space, to the television networks around the earth, and to thelittle TV in front of me.The first human had just set foot on the moon, and through the recording, I wasreliving the moment it happened. This was the moment that humankind’s collectiveview of itself from countless generations past suddenly gave way to a new andexpanded vision of hope and possibility. It changed me forever. It changed theway I felt about the world. It changed the way I felt about the people in theworld.On that day, we were a global family beyond North and South Americans,Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Africans. In that moment, we were humanbeings, and we’d just accomplished something that until that day had been onlythe stuff of dreams. Suddenly it all became real. We were on the moon, and Ifelt it in my body. That moment was a turning point for me, and I remember itvividly to this day.Turning Point 2: Three Days of PeaceJust when I thought that I couldn’t possibly regain the awe that I’d justexperienced, the unthinkable happened. The TV stations that had been showing theimages of Neil Armstrong on the moon just a few weeks before were now carryinganother story that the whole world was watching as well.As I stepped over and turned up the volume on the TV set, it was clear that thestory had the attention of the tired workers with me at the dinner table. In atwist of fate that couldn’t have been choreographed any better in a utopiannovel, the television was showing some 500,000 young people living togetherpeacefully at the Woodstock Music Festival in New York. And it was happeningduring the same summer as the moon landing! What are the chances? I thought,reflecting on the irony.The power and synchronicity of what I was seeing on the television was bothsurreal and deeply moving. The news reports were describing how the 50,000 or sopeople originally anticipated by the festival organizers had unexpectedly turnedinto a half million! The bottom line was that the facilities could no longerhandle the sheer number of people safely. The organizers did the only thing theycould do: they declared the festival a free event, and then did their very bestto provide food, water, and medical and sanitation services to the rain-soakedaudience that had turned the New York State Thruway into a virtual parking loton their way to get there!While it had long been known that both the landing on the moon and a gatheringof so many people were possible, the unknown factor was how such events wouldturn out. The fact that Woodstock ended up being the largest and most peacefulgathering of its kind in modern history was a paradigm-altering moment in theminds of people throughout the world. With so many young people gathered in sucha small area with so little supervision against the backdrop of heated emotionsregarding the Vietnam War, the widespread belief had been that chaos would turnthe event into a dangerous disaster. But what transpired that weekend showedmainstream Americans that their fears were unfounded. Throughout the three days(which turned into four days) of music, nudity, sex, drugs, rain, and mud, thereality of the festival became the theme for a generation: peace and love.The fact that humans went to the moon, walked on the surface, and returnedsafely altered the paradigm that had held the vision of people bound to thisworld only. That this event happened during the same summer as Woodstock is astriking fact that future generations will study and marvel at. In the span ofjust a few weeks, we showed ourselves that we have the technology to visit otherworlds and the wisdom to live peacefully on this one without the need for lawenforcement or a higher authority forcing us to do so.As different as the events were from one another, both Woodstock and the moonlanding proved to be powerful turning points in my life, as well as in the livesof countless other people. And while we know that millions watched both eventsunfold on TV, I can only describe the reason why they were so life-changing forme. Both scenarios challenged the world’s thinking, ideas, and beliefs that hadbeen in place before they occurred. And both scenarios showed me what waspossible.img [images/common2.jpg]While the preceding examples illustrate the way turning points can show up inour lives—either intentionally or spontaneously—by identifying additionalexamples that are familiar to us all, perhaps we can get a sense of when they’veoccurred in the past and just how powerful they can be. In Figure 6.3, I’veidentified some key turning points that come to mind as such examples.img [images/pg241.jpg]Figure 6.3. Examples of two kinds of turning point. In both examples—as an eventthat changes our lives or as a discovery that changes the way we think andact—we find ourselves faced with facts that we must either discount or embrace.Once we know that the facts exist, it’s our choice that determines where ourturning point leads.Whether a turning point is spontaneous or intentional, the key to takingadvantage of it is to understand that once one occurs, it opens the door toentirely new possibilities and outcomes. In light of the kind and number ofcrises that we face in our lives today, it may be that our ability to recognizecritical turning points, or to create them when needed, will become the key totransforming our lives.What Happens After the Turning Point?The key to unleashing the power of a turning point is to embrace thepossibilities that it brings after we recognize it exists. Figure 6.4 gives us apicture of what I mean. It’s divided into two regions labeled the “Old Paradigm”and the “New Paradigm.” The place where one ends and another begins, the turningpoint, is shown with an arrow. Because this turning point represents a break inan existing flow of events, it’s what happens after the break that paves the wayto a new outcome.img [images/pg220.jpg]Figure 6.4. It’s what happens after a turning point that tells the story. Inthis illustration, the turning point, noted by the light-colored arrow to theleft, becomes the source of three very different possibilities: it may beembraced, rejected, or ignored. The possibility noted at the upper right is theacceptance and embracing of the turning point and what it has revealed. Thepossibility at the lower right is the rejection of the turning point and theattempt to cling to the idea of a reality that no longer exists. The thirdpossibility is to ignore the turning point. This is represented by the arrow inthe center that points to the past. Source: Dreamstime: © MIK3812345.At a turning point, three choices, each leading to one of three paths, becomeavailable. Each path creates a different scenario that leads to a very differentoutcome. These scenarios can be summarized as follows:PATH 1: We recognize the turning point and embrace it. In this scenario, the newinformation becomes the reason to think and act differently. It gives our mindsthe facts that we sometimes need to justify making a big change in our lives.It’s our willingness to embrace what the facts show us that can trigger a newway of thinking. In the previous example of Bill and his choice to create healthin his life, it was an emotional crisis that led to his turning point. He felthopeless, lost, and depressed. “I began to hate myself,” he said. In the depthsof the crisis, the turning point appeared.He described his signal of hope as the realization of another possibility. Onceagain in his own words, he explained, “I started realizing that I had a lot moreI could look forward to.”6 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en6] His realization was theturning point. Rather than denying his feelings of hopelessness or surrenderingand following them to a destructive conclusion, he embraced his realization thatmore was possible. Bill’s choice is how he selected Path 1 at his turning point.PATH 2: The turning point is rejected. Those who reject information revealed bynew discoveries find themselves on Path 2. Because they reject what thediscoveries reveal, they believe that it’s possible to think and live the waythey did in the past and go about their business as usual. The problem with thisthinking is that the conditions have changed, either in the world or in theirbodies. And because of the change, it’s impossible to maintain the status quo.Their choice places them at odds with the reality of the world. In Bill’s case,for example, the failure to lose weight would have led to additional healthissues and, ultimately, could have cost him his life.PATH 3: The power of the turning point is ignored. This path is perhaps the mostdifficult to witness, especially in the lives of our family members and lovedones. The reason is because those who choose this path often do so believingthey’re doing the best thing for themselves, even when new information tellsthem their belief is not supported. A perfect example of this scenario isillustrated in the conflicting information regarding the role of fats in ourdiet— a view that is now reversed 180 degrees from the views of the past.There was a time not so long ago when all dietary fat was demonized as being thecause of a host of health problems, including obesity and diabetes. In thisextreme thinking, some people eliminated every fat you can imagine from theirdiets, including coconut, avocado, butter, and even extra-virgin olive oil. Intheir firm belief that their choice would lead to better health and greaterlongevity, they followed their new dietary regimen with a rigidity that wouldrival that of a military boot camp. I know, because I was close to people in myfamily and workplace who followed such a diet and did their best to convinceeveryone else to do the same as well!Problems appeared when follow-up studies showed that the absence of fat in thediet actually contributes to health problems such as cancer, depression, and aweakened immune system. Better methods of testing proved that recommendations ofthe past actually denied the body the essential nutrients that are now calledgood fats. Examples of such good fats are the omega-3 fatty acids that have beenlinked to reducing inflammation and lowering the risk of other conditions likeheart disease and cancer.7 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en7]For people experiencing this path, it’s fair to say that there’s a conflictbetween what they’ve believed to be true in the past and what the newinformation now tells them. Sometimes the “disconnect” between reality andbelief is so great that people simply can’t find a way to incorporatediscoveries into their existing way of thinking. My experience of people dealingwith such a conflict is that it’s not so much that they reject the newinformation as it is that they simply ignore it. In their family customs, or thebeliefs embraced by their spiritual or religious community, there is simply noroom for what the discoveries reveal.This place between the acceptance of the new discoveries and the outrightrejection of them even in the face of new facts is sometimes called the zone ofdissonance. The term cognitive dissonance, coined in 1956 by psychologist LeonFestinger, Ph.D., is defined as the “discomfort experienced when simultaneouslyholding two or more conflicting ideas, beliefs, values or emotional reactions.”8[backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en8]In Figure 6.4, we saw this zone of dissonance as the place between the embracingand the rejection of the turning point. Once people find themselves in thedissonance zone, they are held only by the power of their beliefs. There isnothing that stops them from moving into either of the polarities of acceptanceor rejection at any time.The choice we make at the turning point determines what it means in our lives.While creating a turning point may make sense when we see it depicted as agraph, the question is: How do we make one occur in the real world? Once again,an example is probably the best way to answer this question. So let’s begin withthe story of a man who created a turning point by first discovering what wasmost important to him in his life. In doing so, he discovered a personal turningpoint and the new life that was waiting for him beyond it.A Real-World Turning PointKen Kuhne knew he was a successful man. He had proved it through his life, hisfamily, and his business. As the owner and operator of Biomes Construction, acompany dedicated to building nontoxic and environmentally friendly homes, hebelieved his business was a perfect fit for the ecologically minded communitiesof northern New Mexico’s high desert.In spring 2008, however, things changed. It was obvious to Ken that the worldwas shifting in big ways and that the shifts meant big changes for the housingindustry and his business. Even before the devastating crash in the economyduring October of that year, he was wondering how he could respond in a positiveway to the crisis that was already causing the world’s fragile financial marketsto buckle. In Ken’s own words, he woke up one night thinking “about what themost important things were, and that’s basically feeding and watering yourself.I need to help people grow their own food supply.”9[backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en9]Ken’s vision was clear. The question was, how would he go about fulfilling it?His answer was intuitive and simple. It was then that Ken made the choice tohonor what he knew best as a builder, while combining his skills with the needsemerging in today’s world. In the past, Ken had constructed homes for people.But that was not what the world needed now. So he began to build a differentkind of home. Rather than building a place for people to live, he began buildinghomes for plants to live in.Ken designed and built modular raised-bed gardens to provide a unique,sustainable, and affordable way for people to grow their own food. Hisraised-bed, self-watering, and weatherproof gardens are part of a success storythat continues to this day. Aptly named Grow Y’Own, Ken’s gardens have become sopopular throughout northern New Mexico and beyond that I would be surprised ifKen ever goes back to building homes for people again.I can share Ken’s story firsthand because he’s my neighbor. I’ve known of hiswork for years, and my wife and I are proud owners of two of his raised-bedsystems. Both Ken and I have seen our community go through hard times in thepast for varying reasons. The drought in the early 1990s, for example, was theworst seen until the present day. Now it’s the influence of climate change,coupled with the economy of the world, that’s having a similar effect.Ken’s story is an example of a personal turning point, and one he createdintentionally. It was Ken’s willingness to contribute to what his friends,family, and neighbors need today, rather than trying to find a place where hisskills have traditionally fit in the past, that made his turning point asuccess. It’s from stories like Ken’s that we can learn to take these ideas fromthe realm of theory directly into our lives life today.Changing the QuestionIn Chapter 5 [chapter05.xhtml], we explored the pyramid of thinking thatdetermines how we view ourselves in our lives and in the world. We alsoidentified the new discoveries that show where the thinking of the past is nowknown to be incomplete, and in some cases, wrong. While all of the discoveriesindicated in Chapter 5 [chapter05.xhtml] (see Figure 5.1[chapter05.xhtml#fig_5_1]) helped revolutionize the way we answer the questionWho am I? two of them contribute directly to our shift in thinking and the waywe can create our own turning points.The universe, our world, and our bodies are made of a shared field of energythat makes the unity known as entanglement possible.Nature relies upon cooperation and mutual aid for survival, not what Darwincalled “survival of the strongest.”These scientific discoveries, and others, give us the reasons to shift the waywe think of ourselves. In the old way of thinking, the question upon which webased our choices and problem-solving was:“What can I get from the world that exists?”Today, within the context of the new discoveries and our time of extremes, itmakes sense to change the question. Our new question is:“What can I give to/share with/contribute to the world that’s emerging?”As Ken’s example illustrates so beautifully, it’s our answer to this questionthat changes everything. The way we answer What can I give to the world that’semerging? is the key to developing new jobs/careers, new relationships withother people, and perhaps most important, new relationships with ourselves. Ouranswer changes the very reasons we approach life in the way that we do. Itchanges the way we think of ourselves in the world—and the way we think of ourown worth in the world.Just to be clear, this powerful question is not based upon our worldlyqualifications. It doesn’t ask us what we think we’re capable of doing or whatit is that we’re licensed or certified to do. It’s not asking us what field ourdegree is in or how much money we need. Rather, it’s asking us to do aself-assessment. And in our time of extremes, it makes perfect sense to do so.Knowing that the world is changing in big ways, we can recognize that our rolein the world is changing as well. What can I give to the world that’s emerging?is an honest question to ask ourselves, as it invites us to acknowledge therealities of our shifting world.If you haven’t already done so, this is an opportunity for you to experience inyour own life what Ken did in his. While there are many variations with respectto how we may make such an assessment in our lives, the following guidelinesoffer a simple template that’s a place to begin. 1. Ask yourself how your world has changed. * Identify the familiar routines of the past that no longer exist today. * Identify new routines that have replaced those no longer used. * Identify responsibilities that are new in your life. * Identify the relationships that no longer seem to “fit” in your life.2. Ask yourself what’s important to you in this moment. * What’s missing in your life? * What’s missing in the lives of your friends, family members, and co-workers? * What needs now exist for you and your world that did not exist ten years ago?3. Ask yourself what you can offer. * How can your knowledge, skills, and passions be used to fill the needs of today?I invite you to give each of these questions the time and attention it deserves.Write your answers on a piece of paper and store them in a place where they’resafe and out of the way. Come back to them in a couple of days, look them over,and update your responses. It’s not unusual to discover that entirely newanswers seem to come from nowhere after you stop thinking about the questionsfor a while.There are no right or wrong answers to these three questions. The way they’reanswered is not part of a test or hidden agenda. They are honest and direct, andhold the key to putting big energy into equally big changes in your life, justthe way Ken Kuhne did in his.New discoveries give us the reason to change the compass of our lives from Whatcan I get from the world that exists? to What can I give to the world that’semerging?How Do We Know When It’s Time for Change?Once we know how easy it is to create and embrace turning points, the questionbecomes: How do we know when it’s time for one? I’m asked this question often.In addition to the many times I’ve answered it in various ways for other people,I’ve also had to answer it for myself. And while it’s a good question to ask,it’s one that’s not always easy to answer. The reason is because it’s usuallyabout relationships. Whether we’re assessing our job, our family, our romanticpartner in life, or a belief system that we’ve held dear, the need for a changeis almost always tied to the most intimate relationships in our lives.In the following story, while the name of my friend has been changed to honorhis privacy, the details can help us all understand the key to making bigchoices in our lives and knowing when it’s necessary or advantageous to create aturning point.Working as an engineer in the aerospace industry during the Cold War years ofthe 1980s, I had the opportunity to see firsthand the effects of job stress onmy co-workers, their families, and their relationships. The long hours in theoffice, followed by days, and sometimes weeks, of travel to install software onAir Force computers around the country, definitely did not add up to a regularnine-to-five kind of job. It was commonplace for the team of men and women Iworked with to arrive at a computer facility and find that sleeping cots,blankets, and endless amounts of coffee and the menus for order-in meals werealready waiting for us. It took only one such installation for me to discoverwhy: Once our credentials were cleared and we were locked into the security of acomputer vault, no one could leave until the new software was installed,debugged, and up and running. Sometimes the job was complete in a matter ofhours. At other times, the job took weeks. Under such conditions it doesn’t takemuch effort to imagine the stress that these work environments created forindividuals, marriages, and families.It was during one of these on-site installations that a co-worker discovered hiswife could no longer deal with his long hours away from home and days with nocommunication. During a dinner break that we took together one evening, Garyconfided to me that the most important relationship in his life, his marriage,was in trouble. Quickly the conversation revealed that the problems he and hiswife were having were not just because of the long hours. Rather, the long hourswere a catalyst that brought up the deeper issues that pushed analready-strained marriage to the brink of collapse.Looking at me from across the table piled high with carryout boxes andfortune-cookie wrappers from days of Chinese food meals, Gary asked the onequestion I’d hoped he wouldn’t, because I knew I couldn’t answer it.“What should I do?” he said.It was a tough question for me because I knew both him and his wife as friends.I also knew that regardless of what I heard from him in the course of ourconversation, there was a single truth that I could be certain of: Only Gary andhis wife could know everything needed to answer his question. Only they knewwhat had happened between them. Only they knew the nuances of the conversations,the promises and trusts that had been forged and then broken, leading up to ourconversation. I shared my insight, thinking that doing so would end theconversation. But it didn’t.Chuckling at a fortune-cookie message that he refused to let me see, Gary lookedup and asked another question that I was much more comfortable with: “What wouldyou do if you were me? Would you try to work things out, or would you leave themarriage?”“Wow!” I said. “That’s not an easy question! I can’t possibly tell you what I’ddo. I couldn’t know until I was in the moment of the decision. But what I cantell you is how I’d make my decision. I can share the questions I’d ask to getclear and find out what’s true for me.”I knew that my answer wasn’t what Gary was hoping for. But I also knew he wascurious. After all, he was an engineer. His job was to discover what it takes tomake things work. I assumed that his curiosity applied to his marriage as well.“Well, I guess I’ll have to settle for that,” he said, sitting up in his chair.“So what is it? How would you make your decision?” What came next wasinformation I felt very comfortable offering. The reason is because I wassharing with my friend the same questions, the same criteria for decisionmaking, that I’d already posed to myself countless times in my life. Threequestions always help me to get clear on what I’m experiencing, to know whatpossibilities exist, and to recognize what my options are in any situation. Fromromance and marriage, to jobs and family, these three questions have neverfailed me.I’m describing them here because I believe they may help you as well with thebig decisions you make in your life, especially knowing when it’s time for achange. It’s common for the outcome of these questions to become a turning pointitself.In true engineer form, I reached for a pen from my jacket pocket and a scrap ofpaper. I scribbled the questions and reached across the table to hand them toGary. My only instructions were to answer each question honestly.Knowing When It’s Time for a Change 1. Am I happy in this relationship? * While there are always exceptions, most of our choices are about a relationship. Our relationship doesn’t have to be with another person, however. It can be with ourselves and linked to a job, a way of life, a diet, or even a habit. * Once this question is clearly stated, the answer generally “pops” into our heads quickly. Our job is to honor ourselves by truthfully acknowledging the reality of what has been revealed.2. Is this a healthy relationship? * This question may be the simplest, because you already know the answer. For example, do you medicate symptoms, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, chronic rashes, and a weakened immune system, each of which has been linked to the unresolved emotions of frustration, anger, resentment, and hurt?10 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch06-en10] * Do you find yourself searching for diversions, such as excessive amounts of food, alcohol intoxication, or other relationships, to help you avoid the person or place with which you’re not happy?3. Is it likely that things will improve? * This question is probably the most difficult of the three to answer. And you cannot know the answer if you have not already tried to make changes. * Have you had an honest and direct sharing with your supervisor, co-worker, family member, intimate partner, or yourself about what’s not working for you? * Have you sought objective and professional insights from therapy, counseling, or coaching?Once you have the answer to these three questions, the next step is where thereal work begins. If you’ve answered two of the three questions with a no, thenit tells you that it’s probably time for a change in your life. While I’m notsuggesting that you hinge the future of your marriage or the fate of the humanspecies upon your answers, I am suggesting that they are invaluable tools tohelp you know how to make some of the biggest decisions you will ever make.For example, I’ve lost track of how many times, in the face of a challengingsituation, I’ve asked myself if I’m dealing with a temporary “speed bump” ofdifficulty on the road of life, or if the road I’m on (the situation, job,relationship, diet, or habit that’s causing turmoil) has turned into a brand-newhighway taking me somewhere I don’t want to go. The three questions in theprevious list, “Knowing When It’s Time for a Change,” have helped me know theanswer. And it’s these questions that helped Gary make his choice as well.In Gary’s case, although he chose to work things out with his wife, while wewere away installing software his wife made a different choice. When Garyreturned to his home, his wife was gone. His children were gone. His furniturewas gone. His dogs were gone. Gary was left to deal with a very different worldfrom the one he had known only a week earlier.When we’re moved to examine our relationships, it’s often because we intuitivelyknow the answer to our questions already. The longer we delay in making choicesfor ourselves, the fewer options we have as the range of possibilities isnarrowed by the choices that other people make.img [images/common.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN [contents.xhtml#toc_9]GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT LIFE TRANSFORMED: [contents.xhtml#toc_9]Real Solutions in the Real World [contents.xhtml#toc_9]img [images/common1.jpg]“Transformation in the world happens when people are healed and start investingin other people.”— MICHAEL W. SMITH, AMERICAN MUSICIANOn October 5, 2007, one of the great visionaries of our time, Stanislav Grof,M.D., gave his acceptance speech for the prestigious VIZE (VISION) 97 Award.Each year, the foundation established by Dagmar and Václav Havel, the formerfirst lady and president of the Czech Republic, presents this award inrecognition of “ground-breaking prototypes with the potential to bringmeaningful change to the future.”1 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en1] The magnitudeof Grof’s pioneering work in social transformation was summed up in the closingsentences of his speech:One of the most remarkable consequences of various forms of transpersonalexperience is the spontaneous emergence and development of genuine humanitarianand ecological interests, and the need to take part in activities aimed atpeaceful coexistence and well-being of humanity.2 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en2]Grof described why such a fundamental shift in the way we think of ourselves isso vital by saying, “It seems obvious that transformation of this kind couldsignificantly increase our chances of survival if it could occur on asufficiently large scale.”3 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en3]The kind of shift that Grof is talking about is precisely where the journeydescribed at the beginning of this book is leading us. It’s the convergencepoint where the crisis in thinking, the extremes of the world, and theprinciples of resilience all come together as one big turning point on a globalscale. This is the sign of a world transformed. The possibilities of such aworld could take us in any number of directions. For the purposes of this book,I’ve chosen to approach this topic in a way that takes into account both theshift that’s possible on the global level, as well as the things we can dopersonally to create positive transformation in our everyday lives.For ease of reading, I’ve divided this chapter into two sections:Section One: Transformation in the Real World identifies three scenarios oftransformation that are possible, which one I believe is the most probable forus today, and the most likely ways in which we’ll see the transformation show upin our lives in the short term, as well as the long term.Section Two: Visions of Our Future explores two very different perspectives onleading transformed lives in a transformed world. One perspective comes from agrassroots level. This includes comments from individuals who describe thechanges that are important to them. The second perspective comes from theinsights of academic scholars and think tanks contributing to the visionaryblueprints of our future. Whether we’re talking about the future of next week orthat of the next generation, the key is that whatever becomes of our world andour lives, the transformation begins with us.SECTION ONE: TRANSFORMATION IN THE REAL WORLDAs we’ve seen in the previous chapters, there appear to be as many variations ofwhat the world of our future can look like as there are people working to makeit happen. Barring any unforeseen, or “black swan,” events that could changeeverything we think we know about our future, a groundswell of innovative trendstoday is paving the way for a world transformed. So while we’re definitely onthe road of change, the big question is: How will it come about?Three Scenarios of TransformationWhen it comes to transformation, both personal and global, there are three basicscenarios that appear to be within the realm of possibilities. For our purposes,let’s give them names that best identify these circumstances. The firstpossibility we’ll call a catastrophic transformation, the second a plannedreset, and the third an evolutionary transformation. While there are variouscombinations of these scenarios, the idea is that one is unplanned and happensabruptly, one is planned and still happens abruptly, and the last is alsoplanned but happens gradually over a period of time. In the followingsubsections, I’ll expand briefly on each scenario.Scenario 1: A Catastrophic TransformationI’m surprised by how many people envision, and even advocate, the suddencollapse of the world as we know it today as the best way to bring a radicalshift in thinking and living to our lives. In this scenario, for any of a numberof reasons, the transformation happens when the world as we know it abruptlycomes to a screeching halt. Because our familiar ways of life would suddenlyend, it’s the kind of change that could not be ignored. Everyone would beinvolved, and for many people, such a sudden and radical shift would be nothingless than terrifying.When I hear respected teachers and scholars talking about this kind of change,it always reminds me of the 1951 classic sciencefiction film The Day the EarthStood Still, which portrays an event so big that it commands everyone’sattention (in the movie, it’s a spaceship that brings a warning of destructionif the violence on Earth is allowed to expand to other worlds). In a scenario ofcatastrophic transformation, the world recovers from whatever the catastrophe isand begins to rebuild. The old systems that are corrupt and broken are replacedwith new, life-affirming, and sustainable ones that work.The situation that creates the sudden halt might be an apocalyptic event such asa global war, a pandemic disease, or the collapse of the world economy. In thisscenario, it’s the big event that makes way for the transformation and a new wayof thinking.I’m mentioning this scenario because it’s one that’s often talked about. When itis, people often ask, “Why not bring about the change in this way?” Theimplication is that a catastrophe might be a good opportunity to create change.My personal belief is that we don’t need such a catastrophe to trigger bigchange. It would cause unnecessary hurt and undue hardship on the people of theworld who are the most vulnerable and least prepared to manage such an abruptshift. These people rely each day upon timely delivery systems for food, fuel,and the necessities of life.We’ve already seen what can happen when supply chains are disrupted even brieflyduring times of natural disasters. With the wisdom and technology available tous in the 21st century, I believe we can transform our world without acatastrophe and the suffering that would come with it!Scenario 2: A Planned ResetAnother possibility for an abrupt shift on both a personal and a global basis is“pushing the reset button.” In this scenario, the leaders of the world recognizeat the highest levels that the very foundation of our global civilization is nolonger sustainable. They recognize the approaching “zero hour,” wherein theworld’s vital systems collapse under their own weight. This could include thingssuch as the unsustainable burden of the global debt and the devastating effectit’s having on the world’s currencies, the destruction of global industry due tothe unsustainable rise in the cost of energy, or the catastrophic levels ofunemployment that have led to levels of welfare unsustainable for the world’seconomy.A planned reset would mean that by agreement, on a predetermined day, theworld’s industries and commerce would temporarily stop and then rebuilding wouldbegin. This is where things would get interesting, as governments and nationswould have to work together to put a new, sustainable infrastructure into place.One of the ways this could happen is for each nation to employ every man andwoman who wants a job as members of a global workforce that contributes to, forexample, the retooling for the new industries and the building of new powergrids and transportation systems based upon clean energy and the sustainable useof land and resources. When the new systems were in place, the switch for themwould be turned to the “on” position and we would begin anew.While my description here may be lacking in specifics, you get the idea. In aplanned reset, allowances are made for debt, income, energy, and the essentialsof everyday life while the rebuilding is happening. The thinking here is thatthe one-time cost of the reset, and the robust economy that would follow it,would more than offset the present-day skyrocketing costs of living andaccumulating debt. While this option certainly sounds appealing in somerespects, realistically the deep divisions between political parties, religions,cultures, and nations today make the cooperation needed for such a resetunlikely, at least for now.Scenario 3: An Evolutionary TransformationIn light of the extreme nature of the previous scenarios, I believe that thisthird possibility is probably the one that we’ll be most likely to see in ourlifetimes, as well as being the healthiest of the options. In this scenario, asthe unsustainable systems of the past strain, buckle, and break, they’rereplaced gradually with new systems that ultimately lead to the kind of futurewe all know is possible.What sets this scenario apart from the previous ones is that the change isincremental. So while the complete transformation may take longer to appear inour lives, each of the steps to get to the transformation can happen quickly.Just as the temperature had to rise gradually before the last degree increasecould trigger the boiling of our pot of water in Chapter 6 [chapter06.xhtml],the gradual impact of peak oil upon our world, the role of increasing debt inour lives, and the growing awareness of just how fragile the world’s supplychains of goods and services can be are all stepping-stones to the turning pointof transformation. The big difference in an evolutionary scenario is that thegradual changes give us, our families, our communities, and our leaders the timeto recognize the need for change, rather than reacting to an abrupt shift wherethe thinking is more about how to fix what’s broken.A Template for ChangeThe pioneering biologist E. O. Wilson once said, “It’s obvious that the keyproblem facing humanity in the coming century is how to bring a better qualityof life for eight billion or more people without wrecking the environmententirely in the attempt.”4 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en4] I believe there’s a lotof truth to this statement, especially when it comes to the visions we hold ofour future. When we think about what we’d like to see as our future, it’simportant to acknowledge what we’ve already tried in the past, and to look atwhat worked and what didn’t so we can build the lessons of our experience intoour future.With these ideas in mind, let’s compare how we get our needs met today with howwe imagine getting our needs met in the future. What kind of thinking isinvolved?In the following summary, the column to the left, labeled “The Need,” identifiesthe vital needs that define the way our communities, cities, and nationsfunction today. The center column, labeled “In the World Today,” identifies theway those needs are met in the world as it is. The column on the right, labeled“The World Transformed,” identifies how those needs will be met in our vision ofa world transformed.Comparison of Community Needs The Need In the World Today In the WorldTransformed Core values Material wealth Quality of life OrganizationCentralized/top down Decentralized/bottom upThis summary contrasts the two key elements that determine how information,ideas, and policies flow in communities of any size. These elements are corevalues and organization. So let’s examine these needs more closely, beginningwith the need for core values.Core ValuesPreviously, we noted the need to identify a common vision, the shared idea thatholds any community together. In the example of my mountain community, it wasthe rugged beauty of the wilderness that originally drew a group of diverselaborers, farmers, artists, and visionaries to the valley that became our home,and it was the threat of losing that beauty through development that brought ustogether to protect it. The values that define any community, from a mountainneighborhood to an entire nation, are the glue that holds them together throughthick and thin—in the good times and in the times that are more difficult.For much of the modern world, core values have been based, to one degree oranother, around the idea of wealth and expressed in terms of the acquisition,storage, and protection of money. Without a doubt, money is important, and ourfinancial systems are a reality that we must all accept in order to participatein the present-day world. What I’m suggesting here is that the meaning we giveto money will change in a transformed world. It will no longer be the reason whywe work, and accumulating it will no longer be the goal of our dreams in life.For a core value to be sustainable for a local community, or for our globalcommunity, it must be based upon a principle that works for everyone and that’sreflected in everyone’s lives. For this reason, the core value of a transformedworld will become the quality of life for our global family. While theindicators that tell us about the quality of life could fill a book, they mustinclude honoring our relationship with the newly discovered biosphere boundariesthat make life on Earth possible.In 2009, the prestigious science journal Nature published a feature thatprovided a first step and the reasons for shifting the way we think of thenatural systems that keep us alive here on Earth. The report drew from a studyauthored by Johan Rockström, professor of environmental science at StockholmUniversity and the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre inSweden, and his colleagues.5 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en5] Providing a strongcase for a much more integrated, almost holistic view of Earth’s life-givingsystems, it clearly shows, from a scientific point of view, what so many peoplehave felt intuitively about nature and how natural systems work together tomaintain the delicate balance of conditions for life.While there are hundreds of science-based reports published each yeardocumenting the damage that industry and our demand for natural resources hasdone to the planet, I’m mentioning the Nature report here for a specific reason.It carries us beyond simply knowing about the frightening statistics ofdestruction. What makes this report so meaningful is that it offers a powerful,new perspective identifying the harmony that must be protected among the systemsthat make up the bigger picture. So rather than focusing on a single facet suchas greenhouse gases and global warming, for example—both of which are alreadyacknowledged as vital parts of the equation—the report states that we must thinkall of the planetary systems.In summary, these systems are identified as climate change, land use,biodiversity, freshwater use, the phosphorus cycle, the nitrogen cycle, ozonedepletion, and ocean acidification. It’s the combined effect of these eightvital systems—the climate; the land, freshwater, and oceans; biodiversity; thephosphorus and nitrogen cycles; and the ozone—working together that provideswhat the researchers call the safe operating space that supports us and life inour world.Rockström and his team state that this bigger picture is vital if we (1) are tounderstand the complete story; and (2) hope to have meaningful information toadapt to the changes that are present and those that are inevitable, and toprevent those that are still on the horizon.The shift from a core value of materialism to a core value of quality of lifewill need to reflect this discovery of Earth’s safe zone and these eightplanetary boundaries.OrganizationThe neighborhoods and communities that make up much of the modern world aregoverned by rules based upon the same kind of organization that we see in mostcorporations and governments. They employ a top-down approach to getting thingsdone, and while top-down may work for a business or a corporation, it has itsdisadvantages when it comes to communities. The problem is that when there’sdiversity in a community that’s spread across different time zones, climates,geography, lifestyles, and culture, such as we see in the United States, forexample, it’s rare that one solution created half a continent away caneffectively meet the needs of those living in communities where the conditionsare much different.This reality is at the core of many of the divisions that have developed innations undergoing large-scale change. In a transformed world, the ability oflocal communities to make the choices that are best for them will be the key tosuccessful solutions and national unity.Top-down vs. Decentralized The Need In the World Today In the World TransformedFood Globally supplied/corporate owned Locally supplied/privately owned/seasonalEnergy source Centralized/distributed Local/based on renewables Socialparticipation People feel powerless/apathy People feel excited to participateInnovation Ideas concentrated, come from the top Ideas diversified, come fromthe bottomFood and EnergyEven with the diversity shown in today’s neighborhood communities, there areneeds shared by all. Among these are food; energy; and an economy that providesa way to share, purchase, and exchange goods and services. But while everycommunity shares these needs, how they’re met is where the difference betweentop-down and bottom-up organizations is felt.FoodWe’ve looked at very clear examples of how the globalization of markets, such astuna and disposable paper products, can devastate local resources throughoverexploitation and the absence of sound management. Clearly when we rely uponglobal markets for our food, we support the depletion of the limited localresources that make these goods possible. There’s another factor that comes intoplay with global markets as well. It’s the huge carbon footprint thataccompanies globalization. For example, when we find blueberries, a warm-weathercrop, in our local North American supermarkets in the middle of December, it’sbecause the berries have been grown and shipped from another place where theseasonal climate is the reverse of ours, such as South America.The crop is possible because irrigation systems, powered by electricity fromfossil fuels, have been used to raise greater numbers of blueberries to meet theglobal demand. The quick harvest of these huge crops is accomplished by farmequipment, which also runs on fossil fuels, in place of local laborersharvesting smaller fields by hand. The produce is washed using large amounts ofwater that’s pumped using electricity produced by fossil fuels. The berries arepackaged and shipped to North American cities using large commercial planes thatburn fossil fuels, and then transported to local markets using commercial trucksthat also burn fossil fuels. So while the growing of the berries has benefitedSouth American communities by creating jobs, we have to ask if the joy of havingblueberries in the winter is worth the environmental cost that makes itpossible.Consuming locally grown produce changes all of this. In our transformed world,communities will rely upon locally grown produce and adjust to the seasonalnorms of their locations. The advantages are clear, and we know they’re realbecause they’re already apparent. When we eat locally grown vegetables, forexample, we know the food we have on our table is fresh because it’s been grownonly minutes from where we’re eating it. We also know that the money we pay forthe food is supporting local jobs and is staying in the local community. And weknow that the food is healthy, because most likely it’s been grown from healthyseeds, in an organic and non-GMO environment, and in soil that’s rich withnatural minerals.Examples of the benefits of this kind of thinking—“Eat only locally grown,organic food”—in my own community included avoiding regional health scares suchas the E. coli outbreak from tainted spinach in 2007, the salmonella outbreakfrom tainted tomatoes in 2008, and the listeria outbreak from tainted melons in2011, among others. I enjoyed eating worry-free salads and produce in theneighborhood cafés of Santa Fe, New Mexico, during each of these health scaresbecause the businesses were already supporting what has been calledfarm-to-table produce. This is produce that’s planted, grown, and harvestedwithin close proximity of the places where it’s prepared and served. Thenotation of “farm to table” on restaurant menus is becoming more common in manylifestyle-conscious cities throughout the world.EnergyJust the way that a bottom-up approach allows local communities to determine thesources of food that best fit their needs, the same is true for energy. Whilecentralized, powerful, and reliable energy sources may be good to run thehospitals, schools, highrise office buildings, and apartments in some bigcities, there are places where local sources can supply, and in some casesreplace, the large centralized systems. America’s Desert Southwest is a perfectexample of what I mean.The Four Corners area of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah is well knownfor the duration and quality of sunlight that it receives nearly every day ofthe year. Albuquerque, the largest city in New Mexico, for example, experiencesan average of 278 days per year of sunshine, and some of the smaller communitiesin valleys in the northern part of the state receive an average of 300 sunnydays each year. In places like these, it makes perfect sense to use solar energyto supply homes, offices, and small businesses with the electricity they needduring the daylight hours that they typically operate.In the same region, there are other supplemental forms of power generation thatcan be tapped as well. In addition to the sunlight of Four Corners, its weatherpatterns provide conditions that make wind energy a viable alternative to fossilfuels.The good news regarding wind energy is that it’s not limited to a particulartime of day. It works day and night and in all kinds of weather, just as long asthere’s wind. And it doesn’t take a lot of wind for the system to work.Commercial turbines are about 266 feet high, placing them above the trees andbuildings in the zone where wind is more constant. The blades are designed tomove easily, even when the wind is only blowing lightly. The Nine Canyon WindProject in Washington State, for example, is made of 49 turbines, and while theoptimal wind speed is about 30 miles per hour, these will begin producingelectricity with winds speeds as low as 8 mph. There are times when faster isn’talways better, and in this case, the turbines will actually shut themselves downwhen the wind reaches speeds of 56 mph or greater.img [images/common2.jpg]From the way we produce our food to where our energy comes from, in atransformed world the key to meeting our needs is that decisions are madelocally. One of the basic tenets of the Berkana model for community resilience,described in Chapter 3 [chapter03.xhtml], is acknowledging that the wisdom toaddress the community’s needs already exists within the community itself. Whenit comes to decisions about food, energy, and jobs, the advantages of localthinking are clear. With respect to implementing local changes within the largercontext of global transformation, the shift is already well under way, as theNine Canyon Wind Project and many others illustrate.Social Glue: Innovation and ParticipationFor any community, the factors of social glue, innovation, and participationseem to go hand in hand. Whether the community consists of a blood-relatedfamily under the same roof or a global community connected through Facebook orweekly blogs on the Internet, the principle that holds the members together isthe same: we need to feel needed.In a successful community, each member feels that he or she (1) plays animportant part in the processes at hand, and (2) has something to contributethat the community needs and wants. When these factors are present, everyonefeels excited to participate and more willing to contribute time, support, andideas. I witnessed these principles in action firsthand in my mountain communitythat I described in Chapter 3 [chapter03.xhtml]. I can say without reservationthat they really work.The ground rules of our 45-member community allowed each person to have a voiceand chime in with opinions, options, and possibilities when it came to our opendiscussions. Because we live on land surrounded by Native American history, weelected to use an indigenous tradition to ensure that each of us had an equalopportunity to speak: a talking stick. The idea is simple. As it’s passed aroundthe room, whoever holds the talking stick has the floor and the right to speakfor an agreed-upon period of time while all others listen.Our talking stick was one that came into our community circle quickly andunexpectedly as a member stood up, walked out the door of the firehouse whereour meeting was being held, and returned with the first piece of a tree branchthat he found on the ground. That branch remained at our meeting place, and weused it during every meeting for the better part of the summer. And during thatsummer each member of our community became a necessary and integral voice infinding the decisions that worked for everyone.SECTION TWO: VISIONS OF OUR FUTUREWhen I think back to the television programs that were available to my family inthe 1960s, I’m amazed by how few there were. There were no cable and satellitestations at the time. Networks like CNN, Fox, and BBC America didn’t exist. Myonly view into the world beyond my neighborhood was through the eyes of thethree major networks: ABC, NBC, and CBS. Apart from the six o’clock evening newsthat fascinated me each day, my favorite programs were those based uponscience-fiction themes and the future of our world. I scheduled my swimminglessons, music classes, and homework around the next installment of Star Trek,Lost in Space, and even futuristic cartoons such as The Jetsons.Through these programs, and others like them, we were given a visionary glimpseinto what the world could look like only a few decades into our future. And thevisions were powerful. In addition to time travel, space exploration, andmagnetic cars with no wheels that move at lightning speeds, there was a commontheme that was shown throughout these programs. In the futures that wereportrayed, for the most part the world was at peace and everyone seemed happy.People had all the food they needed from what appeared to be an endless supplyof automated gardens. There were robots to do mundane tasks so humans were freeto do the creative, inventive, and visionary kinds of things that brought joy totheir lives.Fifty years later, the world that George Jetson; his wife, Jane; their children,Judy and Elroy; and their dog, Astro, enjoyed has yet to arrive. For the timebeing, we appear to be stuck in alternating cycles of war and peace, progressand regress, and abundance and poverty, in a world polarized between those who“have” and those who don’t. Both the real-world statistics and our gut instinctstell us that something’s wrong. We know that the polarized world of today simplycan’t last. Something’s gotta give. Something is giving. And it’s hard to missit.The symptoms of our unsustainably divided world are more than just a temporarydeviation from the norm. They’re the proverbial “canary in the coal mine”showing us where our attention is required and what needs to happen as thethinking of the past no longer fits into the world of the present. The turmoilof riots in Egypt’s Tahrir Square during the Arab Spring of 2012 and again in2013, the G20 protests in the American city of Pittsburgh in 2009, thegroundswell of people risking their lives to cross treacherous oceans in fragilerafts and hike across hostile desert borders in the deadly summer heat in searchof a better life . . . are all stops along the journey that began this book. Theworld itself is telling us that we’re on our way to another world. What’simportant now is to make certain that the world we’re going to is better thanthe one we leave behind.The most obvious question we could ask ourselves at this point in our journey isalso the most difficult one to answer: What does a better world look like?Interestingly, it’s common to find that people are at a loss when it comes toanswering this simple question.What Does a Better World Look Like?During a weekend seminar I led in autumn 2012, I opened the topic of “Visions ofOur Future” as a point of discussion on the last day. Throughout the program,the participants had already told me that they believed the current chaos of ourworld is the prelude to a better world of the future. They felt that therealities of peak oil, broken economies, and the disparity of the world’s wealthwere the tipping points for big change. With their ideas in mind, I asked thenext logical question: “Assuming that you’re all correct,” I said, “what does abetter world look like?”To my amazement, as well as that of most people in the program, there werenearly as many visions for what our future could look like as there were peoplein the room. My staff had set up two microphones on stands near the stage forparticipants who wanted to step up and share their visions. The lines were long,and we listened to each and every vision.Throughout the sharing, the audience and I learned something about the worldthat people hope for. Each vision of the future was being offered through theeyes of the hurt experienced by the person sharing. For example, the teachers inthe room envisioned a world with a better system of education where the teachersare respected for their contribution to our society and all people have similaropportunities to learn. The scientists in the room saw a future where they’reallowed to apply the technology that already exists in the laboratory to easethe suffering in the world when it comes to issues of food and energy. Thenurses, doctors, and health-care practitioners envisioned a world where everyonereceives the full benefit of today’s technology to give them the best chance fora long and healthy life.While there was a general agreement on the need for a sustainable, clean, green,and equitable world, there was a definite lack of consensus regarding what sucha world actually looks like and how to get there. As I listened to the heartfeltand passionate visions for their future that the participants shared, I rememberthinking that I was witnessing a microcosm, in our conference ballroom, of whatwe’re experiencing as a world while we move through our time of extremes. I alsoremember thinking that if a room with 1,000 people who’ve consciously dedicateda weekend of their lives to such a discussion can’t agree on a common vision,then how can we expect a planet of 7 billion people with diverse backgrounds,religions, and needs to do so?While we’re quick to say we want a better world and we want changes to happen,where do we begin? How do we initiate the kind of changes each day that willshift the way we think and live? Following are two reports from high-level,highly respected organizations that give us a perspective on how we may answerthese questions. I have intentionally shared the work from large globalorganizations to show just how far the thinking along these lines has come. Oneis through the eyes of the academic world, scholars, think tanks, and futurists.The other is through the people who see the need for change. When we marrybig-picture work with the types of grassroots changes that are being implementedby organizations such as the Post Carbon Institute, the Bioneers, Transition US,and others, we get an idea of how widespread the vision for a big change in ourlives has become. I’m sharing these perspectives as the common ground for aplace to begin.The Global Trends ReportIn addition to the futuristic thinking of individuals described in earlierchapters, entire organizations have been formed to draw upon the vast resourcesof many experts to offer a peek into the possibilities of our future. In thissection I’ll share details about two of those organizations to flesh out thevision of what a transformed world may look like. From the broad spectrum of allof these, we can then identify the realistic trends and futuristic possibilitiesfor our world transformed.Among the visionary organizations attempting to gain insights into our future isthe U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC), formed in 1979. The purpose of NICis multifold. One of the key functions of the organization is to provide eachincoming American President a report of global scenarios and trends to help withthe decisions that will be made during his or her term. The study is called theGlobal Trends Report.Compiling the research, data, and opinions of hundreds of experts fromnongovernmental sources, as well as from governmental organizations,universities, and think tanks, the report gives the President a powerful insightinto the probable course of world events for 15 years, starting from the time ofthe election. It’s delivered to the President-elect’s desk sometime between theday of the election and the inauguration.The Global Trends 2015 Report, released in the year 2000, was foundational tothe Global Trends series because it identified key factors the experts believedwould continue to be triggers of change for years to come.6[backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en6] These factors offer a global perspective for ourdiscussion of what a world transformed may look like. The seven factorsidentified in this report are: 1. Demographics 2. Natural resources and environment 3. Science and technology 4. The global economy 5. National and international governance 6. Future conflict 7. The role of the U.S. in the future of the worldThe Global Trends Report is just that, big-picture ideas of future scenariosbased upon big events happening at the time the reports are compiled. Theseinclude studies of things like globalization and where it’s headed, the role ofChina and India in the global economy, how terrorism may impact the way nationswork together, how climate change affects our lives, and much more. The pointis: these are the ideas of experts from a number of fields, across a number ofdisciplines, dealing with the world as they see it and the future that they seefrom their perspective. It’s important to understand these ideas because,realistically, our transformed world will probably be a mix of their concernsbeing addressed through new and innovative solutions that few people are evenconsidering today.The United Nations My World ReportIn December 2012, the United Nations and its partners launched a new programthat may become a first step toward answering the question of what a transformedworld looks like to everyday people. While the UN has many irons in many fires,and some have become the source of tremendous controversy, the organizationstill stands as the single most recognized opportunity for large-scalecooperation and change on a global basis. For this reason, I’m sharing theelements of a new program they’ve put into place as an opening to ourdiscussion. In other words, it’s a place to begin, rather than a final answer tothe question.The UN program is the first of its kind. Named My World, it’s a well-designedand well-organized survey to allow “people across the world to tell the UnitedNations, global leaders—and in particular the Secretary General’s High-LevelPanel—the most important issues they would like the post-2015 agenda toaddress.”7 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en7] The UN survey was officially launchedin January 2013 and is available online at www.myworld2015.org[http://www.myworld2015.org], as well as in a hard-copy format. So everyone inthe world can participate, the website is translated into the six officialUnited Nations languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, andSpanish.The stated purpose of the survey is to gather the ideas from as many people aspossible between the time of the launch in 2013 and its close in 2015. InSeptember 2015 (after this book goes to press and just prior to publication),the UN is set to convene to follow up on the Year 2000 Millennium DevelopmentGoals.The survey consists of 16 options. From these possibilities, participants areasked to check only the six options of change that would make the biggestdifference in their own lives personally and those of their families.My WorldUnited Nations Survey Questions for a Better World * Better job opportunities * Support for people who can’t work * A good education * Better health care * Affordable and nutritious food * Phone and Internet access * Better transport and roads * Access to clean water and sanitation * Reliable energy at home * Action taken on climate change * Protecting forests, rivers, and oceans * Equality between men and women * Protection against crime and violence * Political freedom * An honest and responsive government * Freedom from discrimination and persecutionAlong with capturing information that includes gender, age, country, andeducational level, the goal of My World is to gain input from the greatest crosssection of the global population possible. The results are constantly compiledand updated on an ongoing basis. I’m mentioning the survey here as a first stepin understanding just what we, as a global family, really mean when we say thatwe “want a better world.”My World ResultsWhile the My World survey is ongoing at the time of this writing in summer 2015,early results show a number of interesting, and possibly telling, trends thatare worth mentioning here. The survey data is broken down into categories thatinclude gender, country, and age. As of this writing, there is a high level ofagreement for both men and women across all age-groups and levels of educationand throughout all countries regarding their priorities.On a global basis, without question, the top-listed priority is: 1. A good educationAfter education, both men and women selected the following categories indescending order of significance in their lives. They want:2. Better health care3. Better job opportunities4. An honest and responsive government5. Affordable and nutritious food6. Protection against crime and violence7. Access to clean water and sanitation8. Support for people who can’t workWhile there is near-unanimous agreement on the priorities that include theseeight parameters, beyond this point the ideas become mixed with no clear trendsevident. For example, men tend to see the category of Better transport and roadsas the ninth level of priority. This is not surprising when we consider thatit’s the men who are generally using the roads more often to provide goods forthemselves and their families. For women, Equality between men and women becomesthe ninth level of priority. This is also not surprising, as there is anear-universal struggle in every nation of the world regarding women’s rights.Not only do these issues pertain to economic equality, but also to protectionfrom victimization and abuse during the vulnerable years of raising children.To be clear at this point, I’m not suggesting that the future portrayed by theUN’s My World 2015; the NIC’s Global Trends; Lester Brown’s Plan B series; orany of the other books, projects, or ideas I’ve mentioned is the answer to atransformed world. Each of them is a microcosm of the world, precisely like themicrocosm I see in my seminars, and what we all see every day of our lives.There are many different ideas of what a better world looks like—probably asmany as there are people in the world itself! I’m sharing them at this point toground our view of the reality of so many different ideas and to lay thefoundation of facts for where we go next. It’s from this point that we’ll havethe information to bring in new possibilities—new turning points—with thepotential to lead to new outcomes and, perhaps, very different worlds from thosedescribed in the reports.Cuba, 1990: An Example of a Real-World Turning PointWhile think tanks and visionary scholars speculate on how a future of brokeneconomies, the loss of corporate agriculture, and the peak-oil scenarios mightplay out, history gives us a real-world example that takes the guesswork out ofthe equation. Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in the 1990safter the Cold War, Cuba became a prime candidate for the benefits of communityresilience. What happened for Cuba in the early ’90s is difficult to imagine.But because it did happen in our lifetimes, it provides a living laboratory thatshows us the power of a turning point of resilience.For a number of reasons, including the continuing U.S. trade embargo upon theisland nation, during the Cold War years Cuba’s livelihood depended heavily uponthe imports, exports, oil, and support of the former Soviet Union. When theU.S.S.R. disbanded, Cuba’s imports fell dramatically. The post–Cold War economywas not only devastating for the people of Russia, it was even worse for Cubabecause of its geographic and political isolation.Suddenly Cuba lost 80 percent of its export and import markets. Seeminglyovernight, the gross domestic product dropped by 34 percent. Its oil-fed systemof transportation and agriculture screeched to a halt. For a period of time, itcould take three hours to catch a bus, and food consumption was reduced to aslittle as one-fifth of what it was before everything changed. The nation’soil-fed power system could no longer produce electricity, and there were rollingblackouts that lasted for much of the day. Without electricity, the cities weredark, businesses closed, restaurants stopped serving food, and the Cuban economywent into a tailspin. During this time, the ripple effect of the sudden loss ofoil—effectively an artificial post-peak-oil scenario—became painfully clear.Cuba doesn’t produce its own oil. It relies on imports. And when they stopped,there was no substitute fuel, because the nation hadn’t developed one. Theconditions became dangerous. The agriculture that Cubans had depended upon waspossible only because of the oil that had made it possible to grow, irrigate,and harvest a lot of food quickly. Without the oil, agriculture declined andpeople needed food. The combination of the collapse of agriculture, the loss ofimported oil, and no foreign markets created the perfect storm that is oftenreferred to in Cuba today as the Special Period in Time of Peace, or simply theSpecial Period. It was during this time that the Cuban people made the decisionto adapt to the extremes they faced. What happened next will sound like it’staken from the highlights of this book. I’m sharing it here as an example of,and a testament to, the power of communities to create local solutions that workfor them in a healthy and sustainable way.In cities throughout Cuba, including the capital of Havana (populationapproximately 2.1 million), the residents formed neighborhood communities. I’mnot suggesting that they went through all of the steps identified in this bookor that they followed a formal protocol of assigning responsibilities or astructure of authority. What I am saying is that they recognized the need tocome together as a community to address a problem that they all shared. At thetime, it was survival that motivated them: the communities needed to eat, andthis became the driving value of their community vision.One of the first things they did was to identify public lands that were notbeing used. As communities, they cleaned up the land and began to plantinner-city gardens. During this time Australian experts came to Cuba anddemonstrated the value of permaculture farming under such conditions.Permaculture is a form of ecological design that models self-sustained gardensfrom natural ecosystems. Carmen López, the director of one of the permaculturecenters, described the effect of the Australians’ teaching: “With thisdemonstration, neighbors began to see the possibilities of what they can do ontheir rooftops and their patios.”8 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en8]The gardens were successful. The communities began to produce enough food notonly to feed themselves, but also people in other communities. Today, thegardens continue. They’re now organic and have made the neighborhoods andcommunities they serve so economically sustainable that their presence has hadan effect upon the policies of the government itself.Seeing the value in the resilient response of the people to the conditions theyfaced, the Cuban government has changed its motto from “Socialism or Death” to“A Better World Is Possible.”9 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en9] They’ve also takenthe steps toward more bottom-up government by shifting decision making down tothe community level, rather than enforcing policies that are made at a higherlevel from a location that is less in touch with the local issues. In this way,government officials are encouraging greater community participation and thepeople feel that they have a voice in their lives, their communities, and theirfuture.The success of Cuba’s response is not limited to agriculture alone. The sameprinciples of community resilience and local solutions that kept people aliveduring the Special Period have now been applied to other areas of Cuban life,including energy, education, and health care.Finding the Turning PointOne key to an evolutionary transformation for today’s world is to find a pivotpoint—the turning point of change—where a shift in a community’s thinkingtriggers life-affirming change before the tipping point of collapse andsuffering. Such a turning point for Cuba would have minimized the suffering fromthe loss of oil imports, because the resilience principle of spare capacitywould have already led the nation to find alternative fuel sources. The factthat the Cuban people adapted after the fact is a testament to the power ofresilient thinking and the fact that it’s never too late to implement thechanges that get us there.When we consider the potential of discovering such a turning point for the worldtoday—before we reach the global tipping points of peak oil and implodingeconomies—the implications are immense. In the following section I’ll identifyjust such a point.img [images/common2.jpg]During the years I worked for Fortune 500 corporations, I was trained in crisismanagement and as a problem solver. So it’s very natural for me now to think ofour time of extremes from this point of view. When I look at the convergence ofbig shifts in our world today, it definitely appears that we’re in a time ofcrisis. Just as corporate projects are often over budget and looking foreleventh-hour solutions, the problems we face have become more expensive toaddress, and, especially in the case of greenhouse emissions, we’re now beyondthe eleventh hour. But as I mentioned before, the fact that the crisis—or in ourcase, the multiple crises—still exists is the best news we could hope for.Because the crises are still with us, it means that we still have the time tomeet them with the turning points that lead to transformation. And because thekey issues we’re facing are on a global scale, it means that the scale oftransformation that’s possible is global as well. The key here is to find aplace to begin. We need to identify a turning point issue that addressesmultiple crises while meeting as many of the human needs identified in thestudies and reports as possible.Once such an issue is identified and demonstrates the benefit of resilientthinking, it will lay the foundation of trust and goodwill for the next bigchange, or milestone, on our journey of transformation.So what is our turning point issue? When I look at the crises, the consequences,and the needs stated from so many different perspectives, two choices stand outbeyond all others.The first turning point is that the thinking to make resilience a priority mustbe in place.Assuming that this is, in fact, the case:The second turning point issue is energy.The reason energy is a perfect candidate for the turning point we need now isthat energy is the common denominator that touches nearly every aspect of ourindividual and global lives. It’s a factor in each of the crises dominating thelandscape of our future, including climate change, food production, and theworld’s economy. The source of energy that we choose to meet the needs anddemands of the world directly impacts the concerns stated in the World EconomicForum’s Global Risks 2013, the UN’s My World, and the NIC’s Global Trendsreports, and indirectly addresses others as well. It also lays the fertileground for solutions of social change, a new economy, and environmental actionshared almost across the board.Clearly, energy can be the game changer that eliminates the competition and theuse of war for securing limited resources, such as today’s fossil fuels. If wecan get the factor of energy right this time around in the equation oftransformation, the trust and goodwill created will make transforming theremaining factors, such as food and economies, much easier to accept.The energy that powers the world is the key to elevating each member of ourglobal family to a higher standard of living. Just to be clear, however, thishigher standard would not be measured by today’s guidelines, where theaccumulation of goods at the expense of limited resources is the means to abetter life. Rather, it’s by the sustainable and holistic standards of atransformed economy that we see the elevated standards. I invite you toreexamine the items from the My World survey and do so with the thought of howhaving a source of affordable, clean, sustainable, and abundant energy wouldmake a difference.How can we transform the energy equation of the world in an evolutionary way?With the understanding that Scenario 3, evolutionary transformation, is the mostlikely and most realistic path to our future, the following describes how thetransformation of energy may unfold.The Turning Point of EnergyWhen people ask me where the energy of our future will come from, I begin myanswer with a question: “Are you willing to accept an honest answer based uponthe reality of our world today, or are you hoping to confirm an opinion that youhave already formed for yourself?”It’s a good question to ask, because there’s so much misinformation about energyand our future circulating that many people are genuinely confused regarding therealities of where we’re headed, what’s possible, and what’s likely.Depending upon the way the first question above goes, if there’s a follow-upquestion, it generally relates to what is often called free energy. Even theword free means different things to different people. In general, however, whenthis topic comes up, it’s mentioned with regard to technologies that tap theimmense energy potential that exists in the quantum realm.As an engineer, I’ve certainly studied the theories of free energy, zero-pointenergy, torsion-field physics, and quantum potential throughout my adult life.I’ve seen what appear to be references to it on ancient temple walls, and I’veheard it described in the oral traditions of indigenous elders. As a member ofthe Nikola Tesla Society, based in Colorado Springs in the 1980s (the home ofTesla’s laboratory from 1899 to 1900), I had firsthand access to Tesla’s labnotes, his working models, and his insights that might have led to the freeenergy, also known as broadcast energy, described earlier in this book.In all honesty, while I’ve seen prototypes of energy devices that work inunconventional ways, I’ve yet to see one that genuinely runs on freeenergy—energy from a universal source delivered without wires or cables—and I’veyet to see a technology that is something you and I would like to hinge theenergy needs of our daily lives upon.To be absolutely blunt: Is free energy possible?Yes, I believe it is.Is the technology available for commercial use today?No. Not in a way that I’m personally aware of.Will it be in the future?Yes. The promising study of zero-point energy and torsion-field technology holdsthe potential to revolutionize the way we think of energy and, ultimately, theway we power our world.Will we see it soon?While anything is certainly possible, it’s probably not going to happen beforethe tipping points from our time of extremes appear on the horizon. And this isprecisely why we need to be honest with ourselves and embrace the turning pointsof energy that are available today, immediately.Earth, Wind, and Water: Energy from the ElementsThe next question I hear is generally with regard to today’s alternative andrenewable sources of energy. Will these be the answer to peak oil and theworld’s appetite for energy? The alternative and renewable energy sources thatwe are most familiar with today will probably not be the primary energy sourcesthat power the world in the future. I wish that I could say they will be.Without a doubt, the energy that’s available from solar, wind, wave, geothermal,and hydroelectric power are all viable sources to supplement the types of energythat we currently use in our homes, schools, offices, and hospitals. And there’snothing that I would like more than to say to you that these alternatives toconventional energy sources of today will be where we get our energy fromtomorrow.The reality is that (1) the technology is far from being perfected to the pointwhere we could even begin to think of these sources on a global scale, and (2)even if the technology were perfected today, these alternatives are designed tomake use of regional conditions that support them rather than be imposed as anational or global energy policy. In other words, one solution does not fit allneeds.When it comes to the energy that we depend upon each and every day for reliable,high-quality, and continuous power in our hospital operating rooms andair-traffic control towers; the transfer of critical financial and life-supportdata; and the monitoring of the world’s nuclear reactors, water-pumpingstations, weather stations, and satellite communication systems, whatalternatives remain? What will the energy resource of our transformed futurelook like?My sense is that the answer is really two answers, because it depends upon whenin the future we’re talking about: the near-term future or the long-term future.I’m going to share the most likely candidates that will unfold as the gradualtransformation described in Scenario 3 from Section One of this chapter.In Chapter 4 [chapter04.xhtml], we saw the peak-oil curve and the science thataccurately predicted the shrinking reserves of easy-to-access, high-qualitycrude oil. The reality of Dr. Hubbert’s predictions appears to tell us that wereached the peak of the peak-oil curve in the mid-1980s. An unexpecteddevelopment, however, has redefined what peak oil means in our lives. Thelate-20th-century discoveries of mammoth-sized fields of natural gas, and theinnovations that allow the gas to be recovered, have changed the role of crudeoil in our lives. While the general public is still thinking about oil as theprimary source of the world’s energy, the energy industry has already moved onwith a very different vision.We know that the new technology is working because, beginning in 2011 and 2012,the world’s energy markets were flooded with more natural gas than the demandcould deal with. As prices dropped and new storage facilities were developed,one thing became abundantly clear. Oil is becoming less of a factor in theenergy equation of the world, and various forms of natural gas, includingliquefied natural gas, are here to stay in our lifetimes and for the next fewgenerations to come. The reason: the same technologies that predicted Hubbert’scurve for oil tell us that the world has reserves of natural gas that can lastas long as 250 years if it’s used at the current rates.10[backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en10]Is this a good thing or a bad thing? When we look at the properties of naturalgas and how it can be used, within the context of today’s world, it’s betterthan the coal and oil that we use today and is a step in the right direction.The chart that follows is a comparison of the emissions of coal, oil, andnatural gas. Because the reduction of CO2 is a critical requirement for any newsource of energy, natural gas is a good candidate.img [images/pg263.jpg]Figure 7.1. A comparison of coal, oil, and natural gas, showing the advantagesand disadvantages of each, including the CO2 emissions. Source: InternationalEnergy Agency.Natural gas burns approximately 50 percent cleaner than its counterparts of oiland coal, and is less expensive, making it more accessible to everyone. Ifnatural gas can be extracted wisely, and if we factor in the local use ofrenewable sources, including solar, wind, and geothermal and hydroelectricpower, where it makes sense to do so, it’s possible that natural gas will be astepping-stone to meet the world’s energy needs while we develop an ultimatesource of abundant and clean energy.Big Energy with No CO2?If I said to you that there is a source of energy that is abundant in the earth,cannot be made into a weapon, cannot melt down in a reactor, and emits nogreenhouse gases, it would sound as though we had a nearly perfect energysource. Well, what I’ll describe here is not perfect, but it may be another stepin our journey to the ultimate source of energy.During the super-secret Manhattan Project of the mid-20th century, the race wason in the United States to find the mineral that could run the nation’s nuclearreactors and produce byproducts that could be made into weapons in the Cold Warera. The wartime thinking opted for uranium with its by-product of plutonium asthe mineral of choice. Since that time, uranium has continued to be the fuelsource for most of the world’s 430 or so reactors. While most people aregenerally aware that this is the case, they’re also surprised to learn thatanother mineral was discovered that had many of the qualities of uranium as afuel source, but without the harmful by-products. This element, thorium, isnumber 90 on the periodic table.If we’re really serious about creating large amounts of electricity, and doingso from an energy source that creates zero greenhouse gases, until we havefree-energy technologies, thorium should be at the top of our list. Here’s why.It works on principles that are a little different from the uranium that we’reall familiar with, and those differences make it an attractive alternative.In essence, the purpose of conventional power generators is to create the heatthat drives the turbines to produce electricity. There are many ways that theheat can be created. The familiar technologies of the past include the burningof coal, oil, and natural gas. Nuclear reactors generate heat as well, and do sothrough a controlled chain reaction. The process generates so much heat, infact, that separate cooling systems have to be built and maintained to help thereactors’ temperatures stay within safe limits. When a reactor “melts down,” orgets so hot that the shielding is destroyed, it’s often because the coolingsystems have failed, such as we saw with the 2011 Fukushima power-stationdisaster in Japan.I’m describing these principles here, because while thorium is used in a form ofreactor, it works on a principle that makes it impossible to melt down. Theliquid that the fuel is made of—a thorium and fluoride salt solution—is the sameliquid that cools the system. One of the interesting properties of a thoriumgenerator is that there’s a direct relationship between its ability to generateheat and its temperature, and that difference is probably not what you’d expect.In the case of thorium salts, the warmer they become, the less ability they haveto generate the heat. This means that if they were to reach a dangeroustemperature, by the time they did so the reactivity would already be in a verylow state. Safety plugs made of the same hardened salts that make the fuelitself would melt away, allowing the slurry to drain away into anothercontainer. In other words, the stuff that’s producing the reaction while coolingthe system would empty into a separate vessel, thereby preventing any furtherreaction from continuing.From local economics to global policies, there are a number of reasons why themainstream energy industry and the mainstream press may have been reluctant toembrace thorium as an energy source in the past. In light of its implicationsfor climate change, low cost, and energy security, those reasons may now be lessof a factor. Thorium energy is beyond theory at the present time, and a numberof thorium generators have already been built and are being used successfullyfor research and commercial applications in different countries, includingIndia, Germany, China, and the United States. In the U.S., there have been twothorium generators: the Indian Point facility, which was operational between1962 and 1980, and the Elk River facility, which was operational between 1963and 1968.So while we need more research to hone thorium technology to meet thelarge-scale needs of the world, it holds the promise of a clean, abundant, andrelatively safe alternative to tide us over while we engage in our search forthe ultimate source of energy.11 [backmatter02.xhtml#ch07-en11]img [images/pg266.jpg]Figure 7.2. Thorium is safer than conventional uranium reactor fuels. It’simpossible to create a meltdown in a thorium reactor, such as we saw in theChernobyl and Fukushima disasters. Its by-products cannot be weaponized, and itcreates zero CO2 emissions, while being inexpensive and abundant in the earth.Source: International Energy Agency.I believe that our civilization will ultimately perfect the technology to tapthe potential of “empty” space and torsion fields to fill our energy needs. Theevidence suggests that after oil, we’ll probably pass through two more phases ofenergy production on our way to the best futuristic source. The first of thesephases is the era of natural gas that weans the world from oil and coal andreduces the greenhouse emissions from each. The second phase is the combinationof renewable sources and thorium reactors that provide abundant energy with noharmful greenhouse emissions.img [images/common2.jpg]There are many possibilities that could become global turning points in our timeof extremes, including revamping national currencies and meeting new greenhouseemission standards to minimize the effects of climate change. While these andother turning points are certainly viable, the development of new energy sourcesnot only addresses the needs of the world economy and climate standards, it’salso a direct step toward raising the standard of living for all people. Theadded benefit of goodwill that could come from such an effort, combined with theelimination of the conflict that has come with exploiting finite energy sourcesin the past, makes a turning point of new energy very attractive.Advanced Technology or Sophisticated Wisdom?During an emotion-charged exchange that I had with a regional archaeologistworking in New Mexico in the 1990s, the conversation turned toward the role ofthe past and what it can mean for our future. We happened to meet at one of themost intriguing archaeological sites I’ve ever explored, the mysterious remnantsof Chaco Canyon.Located in the Four Corners area of northwestern New Mexico, Chaco Canyon is anenigma of such significance that it’s now recognized as a UNESCO World HeritageSite to ensure that the sophisticated observatory, the perfectly formedunderground kivas (circular ceremonial chambers typical of some North Americannative traditions), and the 2,400 known archaeological sites are preserved forfuture generations. Part of the mystery of Chaco is that while some aspects ofthe site show an advanced knowledge that’s about 1,000 years ahead of that ofpeople in the surrounding communities, other aspects appear to be crude andprimitive.During the conversation, I suggested to the archaeologist that we may bestanding on the remnants of one of the most technologically advancedcivilizations to have existed in North America before the 20th century. Thisobviously was an idea that wasn’t part of her training, and she was in no moodto entertain new theories. “If they were so advanced,” she asked, “then whereare the gadgets? Where are their toasters, microwave ovens, and VCRs?” It wasclear to me that we had very different ideas about the meaning of an advancedcivilization and what the evidence it left behind would look like.It was also clear that we would not agree on an interpretation of the mysteriouscomplex sprawling in front of us. I never saw the archaeologist again, and Ioften wonder if the newer discoveries in places like Göbekli Tepe, Turkey, whichnow push the date of advanced civilization into the end of the last ice agenearly 13,000 years ago, have changed the way she thinks of Chaco Canyon.As I’ve mentioned in previous books, I find it so interesting that ourinterpretation of ancient civilizations hinges largely upon the things that theybuilt. What about the thinking that underlies what they built? While, to thebest of my knowledge, it’s true that we’ve never found a television or VCR inthe archaeological record of the American Southwest—or anywhere else, for thatmatter—maybe the reason why we haven’t is what we’re missing here. And maybethat’s precisely the clue to what the future of a transformed world would looklike as well.The native peoples of America tell a story about our past that sounds more likea science-fiction story of another world. They say that a long time ago, thepeople of the earth lived very differently from those of today. There were fewerpeople to use the resources of the land. There were no wars in which people hurtone another or destroyed the land. And the people lived close to the land. Theyhonored themselves and their relationships to one another and to the elementsthat gave them life. During this time, people were happy, healthy, and lived toadvanced ages of hundreds of years that we can only imagine today.Then something happened. Although the elders don’t always agree on preciselywhat that something was, the outcome for each of the stories is the same. Thepeople of the earth began to forget who they were. They began to forget thepower they held within themselves to heal and work together. And they forgottheir relationship to Mother Earth herself. They became lost, frightened, andlonely. In their loneliness, they longed for a deeper connection with the world.They began to build machines outside of themselves that could duplicate thepowers they dreamed of. They built machines to enhance their senses of sight andsound that had become dull and other machines that could send healing into theirbodies just the way their bodies used to create healing from within.The elders say that the story isn’t finished and that we’re part of the lastchapter. They say that we continue to be lost, frightened, and lonely. And untilwe remember who we are, we will continue to clutter our lives with the machinesthat mimic our greatest powers.When I hear such stories, I feel sure the elders are describing us and our worldtoday. With the few exceptions of isolated cultures and remote pockets oftradition that remain, our civilization certainly places its focus more on theworld around us and less on the world within us.Is it possible that when we see the remains of advanced civilizations, likethose in Egypt, Peru, or Chaco Canyon, we’re actually seeing the remains of atechnology that’s so advanced that they no longer needed toasters and VCRs?Maybe they outgrew the need for a cluttered and complex outer world. Maybe theyknew something about themselves that gave them the inner technology to live in adifferent way, something that we’ve forgotten, as the elders suggest. We spendbillions of dollars each year defending ourselves from disease and trying tocontrol nature. In doing so, we have perhaps strayed further from our balancewith the natural world than ever before.The elders say that our cluttered world serves a purpose. Once we remember whowe are, we will no longer need the machines and our lives will become simpleagain. But here’s the key: our lives will become simple because we’ve achievedthe sophistication that frees us from the technology. So rather than revertingto a primitive way of living, we actually become so advanced in the way that welive that our lives look simple to the casual observer.This is what I believe the archaeologist and I were witnessing that day in ChacoCanyon. Whoever lived in that place knew of our relationship with the sun andthe moon with a precision that was not even recognized again until the mid-20thcentury. The people living there built perfect roads that radiate for hundredsof miles in all directions and could only be recognized when modern satelliteimages revealed them. Clearly the people of Chaco Canyon had advanced knowledgeand used it to make their lives simpler.If this is true, then we need look no further than nature to understand who weare and what the future of a world transformed can look like.Whatever world we bring into existence, to be successful it will have to workfor everyone. And I believe this is the key to our future as a species as well.While it’s possible to transform our world in such a way that the standard ofliving is raised for everyone (rather than elevating it for a few at the expenseof many), to do so requires a choice. This choice brings us back to the unspokencrisis that was described as the “elephant in the room”: the crisis in ourthinking. To transform our world to reflect the possibilities that I’vedescribed requires a fundamental shift at the very core of the values that weclaim as a global community. But once we replace the core value of money, forexample, with the core value of quality of life and well-being, we’re on ourway.Just to be clear, this is not a statement that money is the root of our problemsor that it is bad in any way. Money is a means of exchange and, in all honesty,a means that will probably be with us for a long time. My comment is not aboutthe money itself. It’s about us. It’s about the way we think of money, thesignificance we give to money, and the role that we’ve allowed money to play inour lives.When we make this choice in our lives and it becomes the standard by which wemeasure every policy and each action, including the development of technologyand the application of science, the current of change will be unstoppable. Byreading of these possibilities in this book, and others, we ignite therealization of such a world.Creating Your Turning PointThroughout this book, I’ve shared elements of a lifestyle and a shift inthinking that can help us create turning points of resilience in our lives.Everyone learns differently, and it’s for this reason that I’ve done my best tooffer different perspectives that allow us to see how these ideas play out inthe real world. With the information in the previous chapters still fresh inyour mind, you now have everything you need to answer the question: How do Icreate my own turning point of resilience?The following is a possible sequence of steps, a template, for doing just that.A Template for Creating Your Personal Turning Point of ResilienceThe bullet points below represent a high-level summary of steps to createresilience in your life. While this book describes these turning points withrespect to the bigger changes occurring in our world, the principles ofresilience are also designed to foster any kind of change in your life.Regardless of whether these changes are triggered by our world of extremes oryour personal processes, these steps will guide you through the thinking todiscover which actions are right for you.Each bullet point is an invitation. It’s the opportunity for you to (1) consideryour life and the way you’ve thought about your life in the past, and (2) decidewhether or not your way of thinking still suits conditions in the world. If youfind that it’s time for a change, the bullets will guide you to the places inthis book, as well as additional resources, that will help you in your change.Remember, these bullet points represent proven steps, those that have createdturning points for other people and communities. Because they’ve worked forothers, you can be confident that each one can bring you closer to the thinkingand living of a world transformed. * Be honest with yourself. Ask yourself if the world feels different today, now. * Acknowledge our time of extremes. Identify what makes this time in your life different from your life in the past. Embrace the fact that your life and our world are changing faster than we’ve been prepared to accept. Pinpoint what this means for you. * Identify your core values. Ask yourself what your core value system is based upon. Is your answer based upon material wealth, personal well-being, family and/or group well-being, spirituality, religion, or a combination of these values—or any other values? Your answer will give you clarity when it comes to difficult decisions regarding lifestyle and your daily life. * Develop personal and heart-based resilience. By developing the strength of your inner resilience first, you will be better prepared to meet the challenges of our changing world and the needs of your loved ones who depend upon you. * Reread Chapter 2 [chapter02.xhtml].Your Finances * Support the things that you believe in. Invest your money and energy in ways that you can feel good about. This sets an example for your children and other family members, while giving you the satisfaction of participating in positive change on a global scale with your investments, as well as on a local scale with the impact they have upon your community. * Embrace money as a powerful tool, yet keep its role in your life in perspective. The relationship between value and worth is changing in our lives. Explore what this means for you and use your hard-earned money and resources wisely to reflect the new economic realities. * Acknowledge that the meaning of money is changing. A new economy is emerging, and the way we’ve thought of money in the past is changing. We’ve entered a time where the long-term investments of the past now carry a greater risk because of the fragile nature of the world’s markets. This means that assets based in “paper,” such as stock certificates, can lose their value in a matter of hours, whereas tangible assets—commodities such as energy, water, and food—will never be worth zero. This fact is your invitation to adjust your financial plans. * Reread Chapter 4 [chapter04.xhtml].Your Politics * Support people and ideas that align with your values and beliefs. In the present top-down system of government and decision making, the people we choose from our local communities to represent us are our opportunity to have a voice in the bigger picture. There are candidates out there who can be trusted to carry the message that you and your community want to be heard on a larger scale. These candidates can only work for you if you get behind their message. * Be informed. Look deeply into the major issues of our time. Learn to research for yourself rather than depending upon a flyer that comes to your door or the endorsement by a newspaper or an organization for your information. Seek out sources of news and information beyond the bias of mainstream television and radio networks, web portals, and publications. Make the time required for such research a priority in your life. * Follow your choices. After the elections on any level (citywide, statewide, national), make it a point to follow the results and see if your candidates continue to represent your values once they’re in office. This is one place where community can be invaluable, as the time and effort for such research can be distributed throughout the community on an as-needed basis and the results disseminated at community gatherings.Your Community * Gather your community. Now is the time to gather your community—whether it’s your family under one roof, neighbors in separate homes, or people of like mind being connected through clubs and associations in the same city or virtually in cyberspace—and embrace the fact that our lives and our world are changing faster than we’ve been prepared to accept in the past. * Acknowledge our time of extremes. Identify what this means for you and your community. What has changed, and how can your community make the changes easier in members’ lives? * State the goals of your community: Why have you come together? Define what you hope to accomplish as a community. This is one of the keys to the success of your community and what you do at this point will become a point of reference in the future when questions arise as to the scope of your community goals. * Identify your community’s core values. Ask yourself if your community’s core value system and organization is based upon things such as material wealth; personal, family, and group well-being; spirituality; religion; or a combination of these or any other principles. This is a key that will help assure your community members that everyone has clarity when it comes to difficult decisions. * Develop a plan of community resilience. This step is directly related to the way your community feels about our time of extremes. It’s also the step where you and your community members can voice your concerns, reservations, and fears, as well as identify your strengths and the conditions that you honestly feel may need the greatest levels of resilience. If you are in a seaside community that is becoming more prone to superstorms that impact the necessities of daily living, or in an area that is especially susceptible to wildfires or any natural disaster, a plan of action creates resilience before a community needs it, along with the peace of mind that comes from having done so. * Reread Chapter 3 [chapter03.xhtml].Welcome HomeWhen we consider separately the facts of our time of extremes, the records ofEarth’s ancient history, and the experiences of our indigenous ancestors fromthousands of years ago, we’re presented with interesting information. When wemarry these facts, they tell us a story. It’s our story, and we’re completing achapter that we began over 5,000 years ago.We’re living the repeat today of the cycles of change that our ancestorsexperienced in their time. The big difference is that we’re sharing theexperience with a family of 7 billion people. Although we can’t know preciselyhow our story will end, we can know with certainty that our time of extremes isthe birth of a new normal and a new way of life. Our lives are changing toreflect this transition.Your ability to thrive through the transition while turning our time of extremesinto a time of transformation hinges upon (1) your willingness to acknowledgethe emerging world, and (2) how you learn to adapt to it. It makes sense toexpect volatility where life has been smooth sailing in the past. It makes senseto expect record-setting weather and plan accordingly; it makes sense that theweakened economies of the world point to the need for new strategies in yourideas of savings and retirement; it makes sense to plan for temporarydisruptions in supplies and services as the strain of climate change and theworld’s reduced workforce is reflected in your life.These are among the realities that you face as the world—and your life—makes wayfor the new normal. They’re inconvenient, but they’re temporary. We’re not beinghonest with ourselves or one another if we pretend that they don’t exist. Toturn such extremes into transformation, you must be willing to acknowledge whatthe world shows you and accept your role in adapting to what you’re being shown.Because our time of extremes is so very different from times past, it makesperfect sense to expect that our lives must change and our thinking must changeas well. It makes perfect sense to live resiliently and adapt to our emergingworld rather than to thrust the solutions of the past onto the problems oftoday. We’ve already tried those. When it comes to the world’s economy andclimate change, it’s clear that the old solutions aren’t working. It’s alsoclear that to adapt to the transition we’re living through, we must cross thetraditional boundaries that have kept us from knowing ourselves in the past.When we do, something wonderful begins to happen. And it all begins with theheart-based resilience that we can build into our everyday lives.Each of the items in the preceding template represents an important element inyour life. Each bullet is like a rubber band of possibilities that can onlystretch so far. In our time of extremes, each aspect of our lives is beingstretched to its limit. The question is: Will you choose the turning points thatease the tension in your rubber bands of possibilities? Will you embrace thegreatest transformation of power, wealth, and resources in the history of theworld? The shift is all about you. It’s your journey.The new world has arrived.
