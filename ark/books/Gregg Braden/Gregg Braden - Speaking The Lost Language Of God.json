This powerful new audio program gives you countless tools to assess, re-direct, and implement new strategies that will help you realize your life’s desires. This guidebook was created to help you change your perception from the perspective of actively “pursuing” your life’s goals to one in which they manifest as an expression of your inner beliefs. As you move through the program, you will identify what success actually looks like to you and how you can create the kind of life that you want. T o gain the full benefits of the program, listen to each audio session at least twice, ideally three times, and then work on the cor r esponding chapter in this guidebook. Listening to the audio session several times allows its powerful concepts to sink into your subconscious mind. You will make more and more discoveries each time you listen. Whether it’s your first or fifth time through the program, be sure to keep a paper and pen handy so you can capture an idea that particularly appeals to you. Think about that idea as it relates to your relationships, work, and lifestyle. Then prepare a plan to act upon it in the days ahead. Whenever possible give yourself a deadline, and commit to following through on that deadline. W ithout implementing the action steps you have mapped out for yourself, this program simply becomes an exercise in listening. Each chapter of the guidebook is divided into two sections—highlights (key points to r emember) and exercises (questions that will help you identify what you want for your life). You can follow along in the guidebook as you listen to the program or you can simply refer to it when you would like to review specific ideas and techniques. Are you ready to claim your life’s desires? Let’s get started!

The boy connects with his father through an awesome power that permeates every cell of creation. This power is a field of unconventional energy that is sometimes called the “Mind of God.” • The energy field or the Mind of God has an intelligence that responds to human emotion and exists everywhere and is always present. We are only beginning to understand how we participate in the events in our lives and the events of our world through the Mind of God. • This is an extraordinary time in history where the fate of the human race rests upon the choices of a single generation. Through modern technology, we can change our genetic code, create new life forms, affect weather patterns, etc. We are literally making choices that can destroy or preserve the human species. •W e now know how to use the powers of creation, but we are still learning the wisdom of what it means to use that power responsibly. In January 1999, the World Watch Institute released a study that identified humankind as the single greatest threat to our future survival. • Speaking the Lost Language of God will reveal how we can apply the field of intelligence, the Mind of God, in our lives in terms of our health, relationships, jobs, families, careers, and the peace between nations.

Once we understand how this r elationship works, events that occur in our life will no longer seem miraculous. • Ancient cultures chose to work WITH the forces of nature to improve the conditions of their lives. Many cultures still live this way today. The Western culture attempts to manipulate the forces of nature in order to improve them, attempting to make our lives better . •T wo events, the burning of the Great Library of Alexandria and the removal of texts from Biblical records, had a massive impact on the lineage of wisdom that links our modern world with our past. 1. The Great Library of Alexandria was the first library ever created for the sole purpose of preserving all of human history under one roof. According to records that wer e r ecovered, 400,000 mixed scrolls, 90,000 unmixed scrolls, and 42,000 unauthored scrolls were lost when the library was destroyed in a fire in 48 BC. 2. In 325 AD, at least 45 books were removed from our modem day biblical text. For example, the book of Mar y , two books of Jesus’ childhood, and the letters of Herod and Pilate were removed from the text. And the ones that remained were condensed and rearranged into the story that we know today . • This program will explore how the above flowchart links modern science and ancient spiritual traditions.

The scrolls were penned by the Essenes who first arrived on the shores of the Dead Sea about 500 years before the birth of Christ. • Among other controversial documents, the oldest Hebrew books of the Torah were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. • Gregg discusses wonderful excursions that he took to Egypt, Tibet, and other places around the world that hold many ancient texts. • Much of the information that was lost during the Biblical edits and in the fire tells us how powerful and how important feeling and emotion are in our prayers. The outward expression of the prayer is less important than the feeling that the ritual creates within. • Many of us believe that saying the right words, the right number of times, at the right time of day is what is important about prayer . • After the two great events, we lost our understanding of our relationships to the world around us, to one another, and to the cosmos beyond. The lost records actually left us the instructions of precisely how we implement these understandings in our lives. • The implications of this tremendous loss of wisdom are vast.

It stipulates that we are imbued with both human and angelic powers. • The angelic powers we were given are speech, discriminating intellect, upright walk, and the glance of our eyes. •W e were given the creature powers to eat and drink, secrete waste from our bodies, propagate our species, and make choices to affirm or deny life in our bodies. • When we honor the powers that are angelic and take care not to abuse our creature powers, we will experience more of our lives in the angelic realm. • Gregg shares three recent experiments that scientifically validate the existence of an unconventional field of energy in our world: 1. The DNA Phantom Effect experiment concluded that, through an unconventional field of energy, human DNA has a direct effect on the matter in our world. 2. The HeartMath Institute experiment concluded that our feelings and emotions have a direct effect on the DNA, which is affecting the matter in our world through this field of energy. It showed that when the experimenter felt love, compassion, appreciation, forgiveness and understanding in his heart, his DNA relaxed and elongated itself. When the experimenter felt fear-based emotions (anger, hate, and jealousy), his DNA tightened. When DNA is relaxed or loose, there is more capacity for the immune system to function. 3. The INSCOM experiment concluded that when we have an emotional response, our cells communicate through a non-local energy (an energy that exists everywhere all the time) with the world around us, and time and distance have no effect on this communication. • These experiments suggest that we can choose a code of conduct in our lives that has a direct and measurable effect on the health of our cells.

This experiment affected the scientific and engineering principles that we know today. Physics, chemistr y , geology, and biology were based on the belief that events that happen in one place are discrete and independent from what happens in another place. • The recently discovered field of energy (as described in Session 4) is called the Mind of God, the quantum hologram, or Nature’s Mind. Whatever its name, it can be defined as the “stuf f that lives in between the nothing.” • The concept of the quantum hologram is empowering because it shows us that each one of us is vitally important in the outcome of our lives and our world. The “little” choices we make in each moment become the answer to what we will experience in the future. Through the quantum hologram, the decisions you make are mir r ored in the whole. We should become in our lives the very thing that we want to see mir r ored back to us in the world around us. • The quantum hologram appears to include electromagnetic energy, as it is understood today, in addition to highly refined forms of energy that are still being investigated.

The man explains that when he is in prayer he feels connected to everything. • When receiving the Nobel Prize in 1917, Dr. Max Plank stated that, as a man who has devoted his whole life to science, there is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force. Behind this force we must consider is a mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter. •W e are on the verge of mar r ying science and spirituality into a new wisdom. In 2002, scientist John Wheeler stated, “We are part of a universe that is a work in progress. We are tiny patches of a universe that is building itself along the way.” •W estern scientists agree that there are four fundamental forces of nature or creation: (1) the force of gravity, (2) electromagnetic force, (3) strong nuclear force, and (4) weak nuclear force. W e have direct access to at least three of these forces. • The HeartMath Institute has identified an electromagnetic field that sur r ounds every human heart. This field extends at least five to eight feet beyond our bodies, possibly for miles. • The super string theories of creation state that we live in a world of at least 10 dimensions. The higher we go into the dimensions, the less separate the four forces of creation appear to be. In fact, there is a point where they merge into one potent force. It appears that human emotion is the language that speaks directly to that realm. That’s the place where we have access to the lasting healing of our bodies and peace of our world. • When we feel the feelings that we would like to experience in this world as if they already exist, we literally speak the language to the fundamental life force that can breathe them into existence in our world.

Colloquial Prayer —the informal kind of prayer where we speak to God in our own words, at times when we need spirit the most. 2. Ritualistic Prayer —the kind of prayer we use when we say a very specific set of prayers at a specific time of day or season (dinner blessings, before bed). 3. Petitionary Prayer —petitioning the powers that be for the betterment of our lives. “I claim the right to be healed now and in all.” 4. Meditative Prayer —there are no words. We simply become aware of the presence that permeates the world around us and become a part of that presence. • There is a fifth, or lost, modality of prayer that is referenced in ancient texts. In this style of prayer, you fully experience that which you desire. • Gregg shares a story that illustrates the fifth mode of prayer during a ceremony of rain performed by a native healer named David. David described his prayer as feeling the conditions as if they already exist. He stated, “I’m feeling the feeling of rain. When I close my eyes I feel the feeling of standing in my village in mud puddles of rain, I smell the rain, I feel what it feels like to run through chest-high fields of growing corn.” • Gregg explains that when you pray FOR something, it will not happen. In praying FOR something, you are actually reinforcing to the divine the condition that we came here to change. • The quantum hologram, which is an intelligent field of energy that responds to human emotion, is mir r oring what we feel in our hearts in our outer world. • In the lost modality of prayer, the feeling is the prayer. This type of prayer shows that we ar e part of nature and we have the language—a nonverbal language of coherent emotion—to change the events of our life and the world around us.

When these three become as one, you will say to the mountain, ‘mountain move’ and the mountain will move.” • The three dwellings described in the scroll are thought, feeling and body. The ancient scroll is telling us that when we mar r y our thoughts and emotions into coherent heart-based feelings, there is a direct and measurable effect on the world around us. • Thought in and of itself has ver y , very little power. Feeling is the union of thought and emotion. • Gregg cites an example of a friend who hung affirmations all over his home, but believed that no one would want to be his partner. His emotions did not match the affirmations, so they did not work. If your thought and emotion do not match one another, the manifestation of your desires will not happen. • Gregg presents the thoughts of war as an example of how we can change our feelings to transform an experience. If you think the thoughts of war and experience feelings of “hating” war, the effect would not necessarily be a positive one.

Their lives exemplify how these qualities change the world around us. • Gregg reminds us that the feeling is the prayer. Since we always feel something, we ar e engaged in a modality of prayer in every moment of our lives. • Gregg tells a true story about a woman’s tumor being “dissolved” in a medicineless hospital in China. Three practitioners felt the feeling in their bodies as if the woman’s body was already fully healed. By feeling this they brought the life force into their bodies, knowing that her body would mir r or theirs. They then said a mantra that reinforced the feeling that the woman was already healed. The tumor disappeared in less than three minutes. The hospital had a 90% success rate using this kind of technique. • Based on the scientific knowledge that E=MC 2 , Gregg asserts that if energy and matter ar e interchangeable, then feeling and experience are interchangeable. We must be able to feel that something will happen in our lives to bring the energy of it into being. • A signal is generated within our hearts that goes directly to our brains. This signal tells our brains whether to create life-affirming or life-denying chemistry in our bodies. In other words, there is a dialogue going on every moment of every day between our hearts and our brains based on what we are feeling in our hearts. • The flowchart below represents a science—the relationships are consistent and predictable.

When we do, we gain the power to participate in how those events play out in our world. • The Four Secrets of Prayer and Healing: 1. W e are already healed and peace already exists in our world (exists within the understanding of vertical time). We must claim the experience by feeling as if it already has come true. 2. Although we may believe that there are many people in our world today (6.2 billion), there is really only one of us here. Each of us is holographic in nature. Every time one of us finds a new way to respond to the conditions in our lives, the collective benefits from our choices. As many people come together with a common choice, the Mind of God will mir r or that back to us in the world. 3. The ancient Essenes said to us that the most powerful moment in our day is the time between the inhale and exhale of a breath. That’s because when we inhale something is happening, and when we exhale something is happening. The moment in between is the space where nothing is happening and it opens the door of all possibilities. In every moment of our lives we are choosing life-denying or life-affirming choices and the world around us is mir r oring those choices. Your world is mir r oring what you have become from within. 4. Non-denominational feeling-based prayer is the language of creation. We have feelings as we interpret our experiences and those feelings are a language we project into the field.

For instance, research conducted in Chicago and a study called The International Peace Project in the Middle East (The Journal of Conflict Resolution, V olume 32, Number 4, December 1988) provided evidence that if at least the square root of 1% of a given population experiences peace and releases stress in their bodies, the entir e population begins to mir r or that experience. In a city of 1 million people, 100 people ar e r equired. • Given the evidence of the exponential power of positive feelings over negative ones, the next time you experience anger, guilt, shame, fear or any other negative feelings, change your mind and your feeling. You’ll not only change your experience, but you’ll change the experience of those around you. • In the Global Consciousness Project , Princeton University researchers Dean Raden and Roger Nelson discovered that certain electronics are affected by changes in human consciousness. They experimented with those devices during the change of the millennium. There was clear evidence that the prayer vigils and celebration that were expressed affected the readings of the devices.
