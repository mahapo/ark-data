THE following work has been prepared by authorit y of the Supreme Council of the Thirty- third Degree, for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, by the Grand Com mander, and is now published by its direction. It contains the Lectures of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in that jurisdiction, and is speciall y intended to be read and studied b y the Brethren of that obedience, in connection with the Rituals of the Degrees. It is hoped and expected that each will furnish himself with a cop y, and make himself familiar with it; for which purpose, as the cost of the work consists entirel y in the printing and binding, it will be furnished at a price as moder ate as possible. No individual will receive pecuniar y profit from it, except the agents for its sale. It has been cop yrighted, to prevent its republication elsewhere, and the cop yright, like those of all the other works prepared for the Supreme Council, has been assigned to Trustees for that Body. Whatever profits ma y accrue from it will be devoted to purposes of charity. The Brethren of the Rite in the United States and Canada will be afforded the opportunit y to purchase it, nor is it forbidden that other Masons s hall; but they will not be solicited to do so. In preparing this work, the Grand Comm ander has been about equally Author and Compiler; since he has extracted quite half its contents from the works of the best writers and most philosophic or eloquent thinkers. Perhap s it would have been better and more acceptab le if he had extracted more and written less. Still, perhaps half of it is his o wn; and, in incorporating here the thoughts and words of others, he has continuall y changed and added to the language, often intermingling, in the same sentences, his own word s with theirs. It not being intended for the world at large, he has felt at liberty to mak e, from all accessible sources, a Compendiu m of the Morals and Dogma of the Rite, to re-mould sentences, change and add to words and phrases, combin e them with his own, and use the m as if they were his own, to be dealt with at his pleasure and so availed of as to make the whole most valuable for the purpose s intended. He claims, therefore, little of the merit of authorship, and has not cared to distinguish his own from that which he has taken from other sources, being quite willing that every portion of the book, in turn, ma y be regarded as borrowed from some old and better writer. The teachings of these Readings are not sacramen tal, so far as they go beyond the realm of Moralit y into those of other domains of Thought and Truth. The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite uses the word \" Dogma\" in its true sense, of doctrine , or teaching ; and is not dogmatic in the odious sen se of that ter m. Every one is entirel y free to reject and dissent from whatsoever herein may seem to him to be untrue or unsound. It is onl y required of him that he shall weigh what is taught, and give it fair hearing and unprejudiced judgment. Of course, the ancient theosophic and philosophic speculations are not embodi ed as part of the doctrines of the Rite; but because it is of interest and profit to know what the Ancient Intellect thought upon these subjects, and because nothing so conclusivel y proves the Page 4 of 621"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike radical difference between our human and the ani mal nature, as the capacit y of the human mind to enterta in such speculations in regard to itself and the Deity.

FORCE, unregulated or ill-regulated, is not onl y wasted in the void, like that of gunpo wder burned in the open air, and steam unconfined by science; but, striking in the dark, and its blows mee ting only the air, they recoil and bruise itself. It is destruction and ruin. It is the volcano, the earthquake, the cyclone; – not growth and progres s. It is Polyphemus blinded, striking at random, and falling headlong a mong the sharp rocks by the impetus of his own blows. The blind Force of the people is a Force that must be econo mized, and also man aged, as the blind Force of steam, lifting the ponderou s iron arms and turning the large wheels, is made to bore and rifle the cannon and to weave the most delicate lace. It must be regulated by Intellect. Intellect is to the people and the people's Force, what the slender needle of the compass is to the ship – its soul, always counselling the huge mass of wood and iron, and always pointing to the north. To attack the citadels built up on all sides against the human race by superstitions, despotisms, and prejudices, the Force must have a brain and a law. Then its deeds of daring produce per manent results, and there is real progress. Then there are sublime conquests. Thought is a force, and philosophy should be an energ y, finding its aim and its effects in the a melioration of mankind. The two great motors are Truth and Love. When all these Forces are comb ined, and guided b y the Intellect, and regulated by the RULE of Right, and Justice, and of combin ed and systematic movem ent and effort, the great revolution prepared for by the ages will begin to m arch. The POWER of the Deit y Himself is in equilibriu m with His WISD OM. Hence the onl y results are HAR MONY. It is because Force is ill regulated, that revolutions prove fail- tires. Therefore it is that so often insurrections, coming from those high mountains that domineer over the mora l horizon, Justice, Wisdom, Reason, Right, built of the purest snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in their transparenc y, and been Page 6 of 621"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike swollen by a hundred affluents, in the majestic path of triu mph, suddenly lose themselv es in quagmires, like a California river in the sands. The onward march of the human race requires that the heights around it should blaze with noble and enduring lessons of courage. Deeds of daring dazzle history , and form one class of the guiding lights of man. They are the stars and coruscations from that great sea of electricity, the Force inherent in the people. To strive, to brave all risks, to perish, to persevere, to be true to one's self, to grapple bod y to body with destin y, to surprise defeat by the little terror it inspires, now to confront unrighteous power, now to def y intoxicated triumph – these are the examp les that the nations need and the light that electrifies them. There are immense Forces in the great caverns of evil beneath society; in the hideous degradation, squalor, wretchedness and destitution, vices and crim es that reek and sim mer in the darkness in that populace below the people, of great cities. There disinterestedness vanishes, ever y one howls, searches, gropes, and gnaws for himself. Ideas are ignored, and of progress there is no thought. This populace has two mothers, both of them stepmothers – Ignorance and Misery . Want is their only guide – for the appetit e alone they crave satisfaction. Yet even these may be emplo yed. The lowly sand we trampl e upon, cast into the furnace, melted, purified by fire, may become resplendent crystal. They have the brute force of the HA MMER, but their blows help on the great cause, when struck within the lines traced by the RULE held by wisdom and discretion. Yet it is this very Force of the people, this Titanic power of the giants, that builds the fortifica tions of tyrants, and is embodi ed in their armies. Hence the possibilit y of such tyrannies as those of which it has been said, that \"Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sulla. Under Claudius and under Domit ian there is a deformit y of baseness corresponding to the ugliness of the tyranny. The foulness of the slaves is a direct result of the atrocious basenes s of the despot. A mias ma exhales from these crouching consciences that reflect the mast er; the public authorities are unclean, hearts are collapsed, consciences shrunken, souls puny . This is so under Caracall a, it is so under Comm odus, it is so under Heliogabalus, while from the Roman senate, under Cæsar, there comes only the rank odor peculiar to the eagle's ey rie.\" It is the force of the people that sustains all these despotisms, the basest as well as the best. That force acts through armies; and these oftener enslave than liberate. Despotism there applies the RULE. Force is the MACE of steel at the saddle-bow of the knight or of the bishop in armor. Passive obedience by force supports thrones and oligarchies, Spanish kings, and Venetian senates. Might, in an arm y wielded b y tyranny, is the enormous sum total of utter weakness; and so Human ity wages war against Humanit y, in despite of Humani ty. So a people willingl y submits to despot-ism, and its workmen submit to be despised, and its soldiers to be whipped; therefore it is that battles lost by a nation are often progress attained. Less glory is more liberty. When the drum is silent, reason somet imes speaks. Tyrants use the force of the people to chain and subjugate – that is, enyoke the people. Then they plough with the m as men do with oxen y oked. Thus the spirit of libert y and innovation is reduced b y bayonets, and principles are struck dumb by cannon- shot; while the monks mingle with the troopers, and the Church m ilitant and jubilant, Catholic or Puritan, sings Te Deums for victories over rebellion. Page 7 of 621"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The military power, not subordinate to the civil power, again the HA MMER or MACE of FORCE, independent of the RULE, is an armed tyranny, born full- grown, as Athenè sprung from the brain of Zeus. It spawn s a dynasty, and begins with Cæsar to rot into Vitellius and Comm odus. At the present da y it inclines to begin where form erly dynasties ended . Constantl y the people put forth im mense strength, only to end in im mense weakness. The force of the people is exhausted in indefinit ely prolonging things long since dead; in governing mankind by embalming old dead t yrannies of Faith; restoring dilapidated dogmas; regilding faded, worm-eaten shrines; whitening and rouging ancient and barren superstitions; saving societ y by multiplying parasites; perpetuat ing superannuated institutions; enforcing the worship of s ymbols as the actual means of salvation; and tying the dead corpse of the Past, mouth to mouth, with the living Present. Therefore it is that it is one of the fatalit ies of Humani ty to be condemned to eternal struggles with phanto ms, with superstitions, bigotries, hypocrisies, prejudices, the formul as of error, and the pleas of tyranny. Despotisms, seen in the past, becom e respectable, as the mount ain, bristling with volcanic rock, rugged and horrid, seen through the haze of distance is blue and smooth and beautiful. The sight of a single dungeon of ty ranny is worth more, to dispel illusions, and create a holy hatred of despotism, and to direct FORCE aright, than the most eloquent volumes. The French should have preserved the Bastile as a perpetual lesson; Ital y should not destroy the dungeons of the Inquisition. The Force of the people maintained the Power that built its gloomy cells, and placed the living in their granite sepulchres. The FORCE of the people cannot, by its unrestrained and fitful action, maintain and continue in action and existence a free Governmen t once created. That Force must be limited, restrained, conveyed by distribution into different channels, and by roundabout courses, to outlets, whence it is to issue as the law, action, and decision of the State; as the wise old Egyptian kings convey ed in different canals, by sub-division, the swelling waters of the Nile, and compel led them to fertilize and not devastate the land. There must be the jus et norma , the law and Rule , or Gauge , of constitution and law, within which the public force must act. Make a breach in either, and the great steam-hammer, with its swift and ponderous blows, crushes all the ma chinery to atoms, and, at last, wrenching itself away, lies inert and dead amid the ruin it has wrought. The FORCE of the people, or the popular will, in action and exerted, symbolized by the GAVEL, regulated and guided b y and acting within the limits of LAW and ORDER, symbolized by the TWENTY- FOUR-INCH RULE, has for its fruit LIBERTY, EQUALITY, and FRATERNITY, – libert y regulated by law; equalit y of rights in the eye of the law; brotherhood with its duties and obligations as well as its benefits. You will hear shortly of the Rough ASHLAR and the Perfect ASHLAR, as part of the jewels of the Lodge. The rough A shlar is said to be \"a stone, as taken from the quarr y, in its rude and natural state.\" The perfect Ashlar is said to be \"a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted b y the working-tools of the Fellow-Craft.\" We shall not repeat the explanat ions of these s ymbols given by the York Rite. You ma y read them in its printed monitors. They are declared to allude to the self-improv ement of the individual craftsman, – a continuation of the same superficial interpreta tion. Page 8 of 621"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The rough A shlar is the PEOPLE, as a mass, rude and unorganized. The perfect Ashlar, or cubical stone, sy mbol of perfection, is the STATE, the rulers deriving their powers from the con-sent of the governed; the constitution and laws speaking the will of the people; the governm ent harmonious, symmetrical, efficient, – its powers properly distributed and duly adjusted in equilibr ium. If we delineat e a cube on a plane surface thus: we have visible three faces, and nine external lines, drawn between seven points. The complete cube has three more faces, making six ; three more lines, m aking twelve ; and one more point, making eight . As the number 12 includes the sacred numbers, 3, 5, 7, and 3 times 3, or 9, and is produced by adding the sacred number 3 to 9; while its own two figures, 1, 2, the unit or monad, and duad, added together, make the same sacred number 3; it was called the perfect number; and the cube became the symbol of perfection. Produced by FORCE, acting by RULE; hammered in accordance with lines me asured by the Gauge, out of the rough A shlar, it is an appropriate symbol of the Force of the people, expressed as the constitution and law of the State; and of the State itself the three visible faces represent the three departm ents, – the Executive, which executes the laws; the Legislat ive, which makes the laws; the Judiciary, which interprets the laws, applies and enforces them, between man and man, between the State and the citizens. The three invisible faces, are Libert y, Equalit y, and Fraternity, – the threefold soul of the State – its vitality, spirit, and intelle ct. * * * * * * Though Masonry neither usurps the place of, nor apes religion, prayer is an essential part of our cere monies. It is the aspiration of the soul toward the Ab solute and Infinite Intelligence, which is the One Supreme Deity, most feebly and misunderstand ingly character ized as an \"ARC HITECT.\" Certain faculties of man are directed toward the Unknown – thought, med itation, prayer. The unknown is an ocean, of which conscience is the compass. Thought, meditation, prayer, are the great mysterious pointings of the needle. It is a spiritual magne tism that thus connects the human soul with the Deit y. These m ajestic irradiations of the soul pierce through the shadow toward the light. It is but a shallow scoff to say that prayer is absurd, because it is not possible for us, by means of it, to persuade God to change His plans. He produces foreknown and foreintended effects, b y the instrumen tality of the forces of nature, all of which are His forces. Our own are part of these. Our free agency and our will are forces. We do not absurdl y cease to make efforts to attain wealth or happiness, prolong life, and continue Page 9 of 621"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike health, because we cannot by any effort change what is predestined. If the effort also is predestined, it is not the less our effort, made of our free will . So, likewise, we pra y. Will is a force. Thought is a force. Pra yer is a force. Wh y should it not be of the law of G od, that prayer, like Faith and Love, should have its effects? Man is not to be comprehend ed as a starting-point, or progress as a goal, without those two great forces, Faith and Love. Prayer is sublime. Orisons that beg and cla mor are pitiful. To deny the efficac y of pray er, is to deny that of Faith, Love, and Effort. Yet the effects produced, when our hand, moved by our will, launches a pebble into the ocean, never cease; and every uttered word is registered for eternit y upon the invisible air. Every Lodge is a Temple, and as a whole, and in its details symbolic. The Universe itself supplied man with the mode l for the first temples reared to the Divinit y. The arrangemen t of the Temple of Solomon, the symbolic ornaments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the High-Priest, all had reference to the order of the Universe, as then understood. The Te mple contained many emblems of the seasons – the sun, the moon, the planets, the constellations Ursa Ma jor and Minor, the zodiac, the elements, and the other parts of the world. It is the Master of this Lodge, of the Universe, Hermes, of whom Khūrūm is the representative, that is one of the lights of the Lodge. For further instruction as to the symbolism of the heavenl y bodies, and of the sacred numbers, and of the te mple and its details, you must wait patientl y until you advance in Masonry , in the mean time exercising your intellect in studying them for yourself. To study and seek to interpret correctl y the symbols of the Universe, is the work of the sage and philosopher. It is to decipher the writing of God, and penetrate into His thoughts. This is what is asked and answered in our catechism , in regard to the Lodge. * * * * * * A \"Lodge\" is defined to be \"an assemblag e of Freem asons, dul y congregated, having the sacred writings, square, and co mpass, and a charter, or warrant of constitution, authorizing them to work.\" The room or place in which they meet, representing some part of King Solomon's Temple, is also called the Lodge; and it is that we are now con sidering. It is said to be supported by three great colu mns, WISDOM, FORCE or STREN GTH, and BEAUTY, represented by the Master, the Senior Warden, and the Junior Warden; and these are said to be the columns that support the Lodge, \"because Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, are the perfections of ever ything, and nothing can endure without them.\" \"Because,\" the York Rite says, \"it is necessar y that there should be Wisdom to conceive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn, all great and import ant undertakings.\" \"Know ye not,\" says the Apostle Paul, \"that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man desecrate the temple of God, him shall God destroy , for the temple of God is hol y, which temple ye are.\" The Wisdom and Power of the Deity are in equilibriu m. The laws of nature and the mor al laws are not the mere despotic man-dates of His Omnipoten t will; for, then they might be changed by Him, and order become disorder, and good and right beco me evil and wrong; honesty and loy alty, vices; and fraud, ingratitud e, and vice, virtues. Omnipoten t power, infinite, and existing alone, would necessaril y not be constrained to consistenc y. Its decrees and laws could not be im mutable. The laws of God are not obligator y on us Page 10 of 621"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike because they are the enactm ents of His P OWER, or the expression of His WILL; but because they express His infinite WISDOM. They are not right because the y are His laws, but His laws because they are right. From the equilibriu m of infinite wisdom and infinite force, results perfect harmon y, in physics and in the mora l universe. Wisdom, Power, and Harmon y constitute one Masonic triad. They have other and profounder meanings, that may at some time be unveiled to you. As to the ordinary and com monplace explanat ion, it may be added, that the wisdom of the Architect is display ed in combin ing, as only a skillful Architect can do, and as G od has done everywhere, – for exa mple, in the tree, the human frame, the egg, the cells of the honeycomb – strength, with grace, beauty, symmetry, proportion, lightness, ornament ation. That, too, is the perfection of the orator and poet – to combin e force, strength, energ y, with grace of style, musical cadences, the beaut y of figures, the play and irradiation of imagination and fancy; and so, in a State, the warlike and industrial force of the people, and their Titan ic strength, must be combined with the beauty of the arts, the sciences, and the intellec t, if the State would scale the heights of excellenc e, and the people be reall y free. Harmon y in this, as in all the Divine, the material, and the human, is the result of equilibriu m, of the sympathy and opposite action of contraries; a single Wisdom above them holding the bea m of the scales. To reconcile the moral law, human respon sibility, free-will, with the absolute power of God; and the existence of evil with His absolute wisdom, and goodne ss, and mer cy, – these are the great enigmas of the Sphynx. You entered the Lodge between two columns. They represent the two which stood in the porch of the Te mple, on each side of the great eastern gatewa y. These pillars, of bronze, four fingers breadth in thickness, were, according to the most authentic account – that in the First and that in the Second Book of Kings, confirm ed in Jerem iah – eighteen cubits high, with a capital five cubits high. The shaft of each was four cubits in diameter. A cubit is one foot and 707/1000. That is, the shaft of each was a little over thirt y feet eight inches in height, the capital of each a little over eight feet six inches in height, and the dia meter of the shaft six feet ten inches. The capitals were enriched by pomegr anates of bronze, covered by bronze net-work, and ornamen ted with wreaths of bronze; and appear to have imitated the shape of the seed-vessel of the lotus or Eg yptian lily, a sacred symbol to the Hindus and Eg yptians. The pillar or column on the right, or in the south, was named, as the Hebrew word is rendered in our translation of the Bible, JACHIN: and that on the left BOAZ. Our translators sa y that the first word means, \" He shall establish ;\" and the second, \" in it is strength .\" These columns were imitations, by Khūrūm, the Tyrian artist, of the great columns consecrated to the Winds and Fire, at the entrance to the famous Temple of Malkarth, in the city of Tyre. It is customar y, in Lodges of the York Rite, to see a celestia l globe on one, and a terrestrial globe on the other; but these are not warranted, if the object be to imitate the original two colu mns of the Te mple. The symbolic meaning of these columns we shall leave for the present unexplained, only adding that Entered Apprentices keep their working-tools in the column JACHIN; and giving y ou the etymology and litera l meaning of the two names. The word Jachin , in Hebrew, is יכין , It was probabl y pronounced Ya-kayan , and mean t, as a verbal noun, He that strengthens; and thence, firm, stable, upright. Page 11 of 621"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The word Boaz is בעז , Baaz. עז means Strong, Strength, Power, Might, Refuge, Source of Strength, a Fort . The ב prefixed means \" with \" or \" in ,\" and gives the word the force of the Latin gerund, roborando – Strengthening . The former word also me ans he will establish , or plant in an erect position – from the verb כון , Kūn, he stood e rect . It probably meant Activ e and Vivifying Energy and Force ; and Boaz , Stabilit y , Permanence , in the passive sense. The Dimensions of the Lodge, our Brethren of the York Rite say, \"are unlimited, and its covering no less than the canop y of Heaven.\" \"To this object,\" they say, \"the mason's mind is continual ly directed, and thither he hopes at last to arrive by the aid of the theologic al ladder which Jacob in his vision saw ascending from earth to Heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denomina ted Faith, Hope, and Charit y; and which admonish us to have Faith in God, Hope in Immortality, and Charit y to all mankind.\" Accordingl y a ladder, sometimes with nine rounds, is seen on the chart, resting at the botto m on the earth, its top in the clouds, the stars shining above it; and this is deem ed to represent that mystic ladder, which Jacob saw in his drea m, set up on the earth, and the top of it reaching to Heaven, with the angels of God ascending and descending on it. The addition of the three principal rounds to the symbolism, is wholly modern and incongruous. The ancients counted seven planets, thus arranged: the Moon, Mercur y, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. There were seven heavens and seven spheres of these planets; on all the monum ents of Mithras are seven altars or p yres, consecrated to the seven planets, as were the seven la mps of the golden candelabrum in the Temple. That these represented the planets, we are assured b y Clemens of Alexandria, in his Stromata, and by Philo Judæus. To return to its source in the Infinite, the human soul, the ancients held, had to ascend, as it had descended, through the seven spheres. The Ladde r by which it reascends, has, according to Marsilius Ficinus, in his Comm entary on the Ennead of Plotinus, seven degrees or steps; and in the Mysteries of Mithras, carried to Rome under the E mperors, the ladder, with its seven rounds, wa s a symbol referring to this ascent through the spheres of the seven planets. Jacob saw the Spirits of God ascending and descending on it; and above it the Deity Himself. The Mithraic Mysteries were celebrated in caves, where gates were marked at the four equinocti al and solstitial points of the zodiac; and the seven planetar y spheres were represented, which souls needs must traverse in descending from the heaven of the fixed stars to the elements that envelop the earth; and seven gates were mark ed, one for each planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning. We learn this from Celsus, in Origen, who says that the symbolic image of this passage among the stars, used in the Mithraic Mysteries, was a ladder reaching from earth to Heaven, divided into seven steps or stages, to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth one, that of the fixed stars. The s ymbol was the same as that of the seven stages of Borsippa, the Pyramid of vitrified brick, near Bab ylon, built of seven stages, and each of a different color. In the Mithraic ceremonies, the candidate went through seven stages of initiation, passing through many fearful trials – and of these the high ladder with seven rounds or steps wa s the symbol. You see the Lodge, its details and ornamen ts, by its Lights. You have alread y heard what these Lights, the greater and lesser, are said to be, and how they are spoken of by our Brethren of the York Rite. Page 12 of 621"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Holy Bible , Square , and Compasses , are not only styled the Great Lights in Masonry, but they are also technical ly called the Furniture of the Lodge; and, as you have seen, it is held that there is no Lodge without them. This has someti mes been made a pretext for excluding Jews from our Lodges, because they cannot regard the New Testa ment as a holy book. The Bible is an indispensable part of the furniture of a Christian Lodge, onl y because it is the sacred book of the Christian religion. The Hebrew Pentateuch in a Hebrew Lodge, and the Koran in a Mohamm edan one, belong on the Altar; and one of these, and the Square and Compass, properl y understood, are the Great Lights b y which a Mason must walk and work. The obligation of the candidate is alway s to be taken on the sacred book or books of his religion, that he may deem it more solemn and binding; and therefore it was that you were asked of what religion you were. We have no other concern with your religious creed. The Square is a right angle, formed by two right lines. It is adapted only to a plane surface, and belongs only to geometry, earth-m easurem ent, that trigono metry which deals onl y with planes, and with the earth, which the ancients supposed to be a plane. The Compass describes circles, and deals with spherical trigonom etry, the science of the spheres and heavens. The former, therefore, is an emb lem of what concerns the earth and the body; the latter of what concerns the heavens and the soul. Yet the Compass is also used in plane trigono metry, as in erecting perpendiculars; and, therefore, you are remind ed that, although in this Degree both points of the Compass are under the Square, and y ou are now dealing only with the moral and political meaning of the symbols, and not with their philosophical and spiritual meanings, still the divine ever mingles with the hum an; with the earthl y the spiritual intermixes; and there is some thing spiritual in the commonest duties of life. The nations are not bodies-politic alone, but also souls-politic; and woe to that people which, seeking the ma terial only, forgets that it has a s oul. Then we have a race, petrified in dogma, which presupposes the absence of a soul and the presence only of memory and instinct, or demoral ized by lucre. Such a nature can never lead civilization. Genuflexion before the idol or the dollar atrophies the muscle which walks and the will which moves. Hieratic or mercan tile absorption diminishes the radiance of a people, lowers its horizon b y lowering its level, and deprives it of that understanding of the universal aim, at the same time human and divine, which makes the missionar y nations. A free people, forgetting that it has a soul to be cared for, devotes all its energies to its material advancem ent. If it mak es war, it is to subserve its com mercial interests. The citizens copy after the State, and regard wealth, pomp, and luxury as the great goods of life. Such a nation creates wealth rapidly, and distributes it badly. Thence the two extre mes, of monstrous opulence and monstrous misery; all the enjoyment to a few, all the privations to the rest, that is to say, to the people; Privilege, Exception, Monopoly , Feudalit y, springing up from Labor itself: a false and dangerous situation, which, making Labor a blinded and chained Cyclops, in the min e, at the forge, in the workshop, at the loom, in the field, over poisonous fumes, in miasm atic cells, in unventila ted factories, founds public power upon private misery, and plants the greatness of the State in the suffering of the individual. It is a greatness ill constituted, in which all the material elements are combin ed, and into which no mora l element enters. If a people, like a star, has the right of eclipse, the light ought to return. The eclipse should not degenerate into night.

But the Sun and Moon do in no sense light the Lodge, unless it be symbolically, and then the lights are not they , but those things of which the y are the symbols. Of what they are the symbols the Mason in that Rite is not told. Nor does the Moon in an y sense rule the night with regularit y. The Sun is the ancient symbol of the life-giving and generativ e power of the Deity. To the ancients, light was the cause of life; and God was the source from which all light flowed; the essence of Light, the Invisible Fire, developed as flame manifested as light and splendor. The Sun wa s His man ifestation and visible image; and the Sabæans w orshipping the Light – God, seemed to worship the Sun, in whom they saw the man ifestation of the Deity. The Moon w as the symbol of the passive capacit y of nature to produce, the female, of which the life- giving power and energy was the male. It was the s ymbol of Isis, Astarte, and Artemis, or Diana. The \" Master of Life \" was the Suprem e Deity, above both, and manifested through both; Zeus, the Son of Saturn, become King of the Gods; Horu s, son of Osiris and Isis, become the Master of Life; Dionuso s or Bacchus, like Mithras, become the author of Light and Life and Truth. * * * * * * The Master of Light and Life, the Sun and the Moon, are symbolized in ever y Lodge b y the Master and Wardens: and this makes it the dut y of the Master to dispense light to the Brethren, by himself, and through the Wardens, who are his minist ers. \"Thy sun,\" says ISAIAH to Jerusalem, \"shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Th y people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever.\" Such is the t ype of a free people. Our northern ancestors wor shipped this tri- une Deit y; ODIN, the Almight y FATHER; FREA, his wife, emb lem of universal matter; and THOR, his son, the mediator. But above all these was the Supreme God, \"the author of ever ything that existeth, the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Awful Being, the Searcher into concealed things, the Being that never changeth.\" In the Te mple of Eleusis (a sanctuar y lighted only by a window in the roof, and representing the Universe), the images of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury , were represented. \"The Sun and Moon,\" says the learned Bro DELAUNAY, \"represent the two grand ∴ principles of all generations, the active and passive, the male and the fe male. The Sun represents the actual light. He pour s upon the Moon his fecundating rays; both shed their light upon their offspring, the Blazing Star, or HOR US, and the three form the great Equilateral Triangle, in the centre of which is the omnific letter of the Kabalah, by which creation is said to have been effected.\" The ORNAMENTS of a Lodge are said to be \"the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star.\" The Mosaic Pavem ent, chequered in squares or lozenges, is said to represent the ground-floor of King Solomon's Temple; and the Indented Tessel \"that beautiful tesselated border which surrounded it.\" The Blazing Star in the centre is said to Page 14 of 621"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike be \"an emble m of Divine Providence, and com memorative of the star which appeared to guide the wise men of the East to the place of our Saviour's nativit y.\" But \"there was no stone seen\" within the Temple. The walls were covered with planks of cedar, and the floor was covered with planks of fir. There is no evidence that there was such a pave ment or floor in the Temple, or such a bordering. In England, ancientl y, the Tracing- Board was surrounded with an indented border; and it is onl y in Americ a that such a border is put around the Mo saic pavement. The tesseræ, indeed, are the squares or lozenges of the pavement. In England, also, \"the indented or denticulated border\" is called \"tesselated,\" because it has four \"tas sels,\" said to represent Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. It was termed the Indented Trassel; but this is a misuse of words. It is a tesserated pavement, with an indented border round it. The pavemen t, alterna tely black and white, symbolizes, whether so intended or not, the Good and Evil Principles of the Egyptian and Persian creed. It is the warfare of Michael and Satan, of the Gods and Titans, of Balder and Lok; between light and shadow, w hich is darkness; Da y and Night; Freedom and Despotism; Religious Liberty and the Arbitrary Dogmas of a Church that thinks for its votaries, and whose Pontiff clai ms to be infallib le, and the decretals of its Councils to constitute a gospel. The edges of this pave ment, if in lozenges, will necessaril y be indented or denticul ated, toothed like a saw; and to compl ete and finish it a bordering is necessary . It is comp leted by tassels as ornam ents at the corners. If these and the bordering have any symbolic meaning, it is fanciful and arbitrar y. To find in the BLAZING ST AR of five points an allusion to the Divine Providence, is also fanciful; and to mak e it commemorative of the Star that is said to have guided the Magi, is to give it a mean ing comparatively modern. Originall y it represented SIRIUS, or the Dog- star, the forerunner of the inundation of the Nile; the God ANUBIS, compan ion of Isis in her search for the body of OSIRIS, her brother and hu sband. Then it became the image of HORUS, the son of OSIRI S, himself symbolized also by the Sun, the author of the Seasons, and the God of Ti me; Son of I sis, who was the universal nature, himself the primitive matter, inexhaustible source of Life, spark of uncreated fire, universal seed of all beings. It was HERMES, also, the Master of Learning, whose name in Greek is that of the God Mercury . It beca me the sacred and potent sign or character of the Magi, the PENTALPH A, and is the significant emblem of Libert y and Freedom, blazing with a steady radiance amid the weltering elements of good and evil of Revolutions, and promising serene skies and fertile seasons to the nations, after the storms of change and tumult. In the East of the Lodge, over the Master, inclosed in a triangle, is the Hebrew letter YŌD [ י or ]. In the English and American Lodges the Letter G is substituted for this, as the ∴ initial of the word GO D, with as little reason as if the letter D., initial of DIEU, were used in French Lodges instead of the proper letter. YŌD is, in the Kabalah, the symbol of Unity , of the Supreme Deity, the first letter of the Holy Name; and also a symbol of the Great Kabalistic Triads. To understand its m ystic meanings, you must open the pages of the Sohar and Siphra de Zeniutha, and other kabalisti c books, and ponder deepl y on their meaning. It must suffice to say, that it is the Creative Energy of the Deity, is represented as Page 15 of 621"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike a point , and that point in the centre of the Circle of imm ensity. It is to us in this Degree, the symbol of that unmanifested Deity, the Ab solute, who has no name. Our French Brethren place this letter YŌD in the centre of the Blazing Star. And in the old Lectures, our ancient English Brethren said, \"The Blazing Star or Glory in the centre refers us to that grand lu minary, the Sun, which enlightens the earth, and by its genial influence dispenses blessings to mank ind.\" They called it also in the same lectures, an embl em of PRUDENCE. The word Prudentia means, in its original and fullest significat ion, Foresight ; and, accordingl y, the Blazing Star has been regarded as an emb lem of Omnisci ence, or the All- seeing Eye, which to the Egyptian Initiates was the emblem of Osiris, the Creator. With the YŌD in the centre, it has the kabalistic meaning of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe. The Jewels of the Lodge are said to be six in number. Three are called \" Movable ,\" and three \" Immovable .\" The SQUARE, the LEVEL, and the PLUMB were ancientl y and properl y called the Movable Jewels, because they pass from one Brother to another. It is a modern innovation to call them immovable, because they must always be present in the Lodge. The immovable jewels are the ROUGH A SHLAR, the PERFECT ASHLAR or CUBICAL STO NE, or, in some Rituals, the DOUBLE CUBE, and the TRACING- BOARD, or TRESTLE- BOARD. Of these jewels our Brethren of the York Rite say: \"The Squa re inculcates Moralit y; the Level , Equalit y; and the Plumb , Rectitude of Conduct.\" Their explanation of the immovable Jewels ma y be read in their monitors. * * * * * * Our Brethren of the York Rite say that \"there is represented in every well-governed Lodge, a certain point, within a circle; the point representing an individual Brother; the Circle, the boundar y line of his conduct, beyond which he is never to suffer his pre judices or passions to betray him.\" This is not to interpret the symbols of Masonry. It is said b y some, with a nearer approach to interpretat ion, that the point within the circle represents God in the centre of the Universe. It is a com mon Egyptian sign for the Sun and O siris, and is still used as the astronom ical sign of the great lu minary. In the Kabalah the point is YŌ D, the Creative Energy of God, irradiating with light the circular space which God, the universal Light, left vacant, wherein to create the worlds, by withdrawing His sub stance of Light back on all sides from one point. Our Brethren add that, \"this circle is embordered by two perpendicular paralle l lines, representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, and upon the top rest the Holy Scriptures\" (an open book). \"In going round this circle,\" they say, \"we necessaril y touch upon these two lines as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should mat erially err.\" It would be a waste of ti me to comm ent upon this. Some writers have imagined that the parallel lines represent the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which the Sun alternate ly touches upon at the Summer and Winter solstices. But the tropics are not perpendicular lines, and the idea is merel y fanciful. If the paralle l lines ever belonged to the ancient symbol, they had some more recondite and more fruitful meaning. They probabl y had the Page 16 of 621"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike same meaning as the twin columns Jachin and Boaz. That meaning is not for the Apprentice. The adept may find it in the Kabalah. The JUSTICE and MERC Y of God are in equilibrium , and the result is HARMO NY, because a Single and Perfect Wisdom presides over both. The Holy Scriptures are an entirel y modern addition to the s ymbol, like the terrestria l and celestia l globes on the colu mns of the portico. Thus the ancient symbol has been denatural ized by incongruous additions, like that of Isis weeping over the broken column containing the rem ains of Osiris at B yblos. * * * * * * Masonry has its decalogue, which is a law to its Initiates. These are its Ten Commandments: I. God is the Eternal, Omnipotent, Immutable WISDOM and Supreme ⊕ ∴ INTELLIGENCE and Exhaustless LOVE. Thou shalt adore, revere, and love Him! Thou shalt honor Him by practising the virtues! II. ○ Thy religion shall be, to do good because it is a pleasure to thee, and not merely ∴ because it is a duty .

X. ○ Thou shalt study to know men; that thereby thou mayest learn to know thyself! ∴ Thou shalt ever seek after virtue! Thou shalt be just! Thou shalt avoid idleness! But the great commandment of Masonry is this: \"A new com mandment give I unto yo u: that ye love one another! He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, remain eth still in the darkness.\" Such are the mora l duties of a Mason. But it is also the duty of Masonry to assist in elevating the moral and intellec tual level of societ y; in coining knowledge, bringing ideas into circulat ion, and causing the mind of youth to grow; and in putting, graduall y, by the teachings of axio ms and the promulga tion of positive laws, the human race in harmony with its destinies. To this duty and work the Initiate is apprenticed. He must not imag ine that he can effect nothing, and, therefore, despairing, becom e inert. It is in this, as in a man's dail y life. Many great deeds are done in the small struggles of life. There is, we are told, a deter mined though unseen bravery , which defends itself, foot to foot, in the darknes s, against the fatal invasion of necessit y and of baseness. There are noble and mysterious triumphs, which no eye sees, w hich no renown rewards, w hich no flourish of trump ets salutes. Life, misfortun e, isolation, abandon ment, poverty , are battle-fields, which have their heroes, – heroes obscure, but someti mes greater than those who become illustrious. The Mason should struggle in the same manner, and with the same bravery , against those invasions of necessit y and baseness, which com e to nations as well as to men. He should me et them, too, foot to foot, even in the darkness, and protest against the national wrongs and follies; against usurpation and the first inroads of that hydra, Tyranny. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the truth in indignation. It is more difficult for a people to keep than to gain their freedom. The Protests of Truth are always needed. Continuall y, the right must protest against the fact. There is, in fact, Eternit y in the Right. The Mason should be the Priest and Soldier of that Right. If his country should be robbed of her liberties, he should still not despair. The protest of the Right against the Fact persists forever. The robber y of a people never becomes prescriptive. Reclam ation of its rights is barred b y no length of time. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teutonic. A people may endure mi litary usurpation, and sub jugated States kneel to States and wear the yoke, while under the stress of necessit y; but when the necessit y disappears, if the people is fit to be free, the submerged country will float to the surface and reappear, and Ty ranny be adjudged b y History to have murdered its victi ms. Whatever occurs, we s hould have Faith in the Justice and over-ruling Wisdo m of God, and Hope for the Future, and Loving- kindness for those who are in error. God makes visible to Page 18 of 621"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike men His will in events; an obscure text, written in a mysterious language. Men make their translations of it forthwith, hasty, incorrect, full of faults, omissions, and misread ings. We see so short a wa y along the arc of the great circle! Few minds comprehend the Divine tongue. The most sagacious, the most calm, the most profound, decipher the hierogl yphs slowly; and when they arrive with their text, perhaps the need has long gone b y; there are already twenty translations in the public square – the most incorrect being, as of course, the most accepted and popular. From each translation, a party is born; and from each misreading, a faction. Each party believes or pretends that it has the only true text, and each faction believes or pretends that it alone possesses the light. Moreover, factions are blind men, who aim straight, errors are excell ent projectiles, striking skillfull y, and with all the violence that springs from false reasoning, wherever a want of logic in those who defend the right, like a defect in a cuirass, makes them vulnerable. Therefore it is that we shall often be discomf ited in comba ting error before the people. Antæus long resisted Hercules; and the heads of the H ydra grew as fast as the y were cut off. It is absurd to say that Error, wounded, writhes in pain, and dies amid her worshipers. Truth conquers slowly . There is a wondrous vitalit y in Error. Truth, indeed, for the most part, shoots over the heads of the masses; or if an error is prostrated for a mo ment, it is up again in a moment, and as vigorous as ever. It will not die when the brains are out, and the most stupid and irrationa l errors are the longest- lived. Nevertheless, Masonry , which is Morality and Philosophy , must not cease to do its dut y. We never know at what moment success awaits our efforts – generall y when most unexpected – nor with what effect our efforts are or are not to be attended. Succeed or fail, Masonry must not bow to error, or s uccumb under discouragemen t. There were at Rome a few Carthaginian soldiers, taken prisoners, who refused to bow to Flam inius, and had a little of Hannibal's magn animity. Masons s hould possess an equal greatness of soul. Masonry should be an energ y; finding its aim and effect in the am elioration of mankind. Socrates should enter into Adam, and produce Marcus Aurelius, in other words, bring forth from the man of enjoyments, the man of wisdom. Masonry should not be a mere watch- tower, built upon m ystery, from which to gaze at ease upon the world, with no other result than to be a convenience for the curious. To hold the full cup of thought to the thirsty lips of men; to give to all the true ideas of Deit y; to harmon ize conscience and science, are the province of Philosophy . Moralit y is Faith in full bloom. Contemplation should lead to action, and the absolute be practic al; the ideal be made air and food and drink to the human mind. Wisdom is a sacred com munion. It is only on that condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of Science, and beco mes the one and supreme method by which to unite Humani ty and arouse it to concerted action. Then Philosoph y becomes Religion. And Masonry , like Histor y and Philosoph y, has eternal duties – eternal, and, at the same time, simple – to oppose Caiaphas as Bishop, Draco or Jefferies as Judge, Trim alcion as Legislator, and Tiberius as Emperor. These are the symbols of the tyranny that degrades and crushes, and the corruption that defiles and infests. in the works published for the use of the Craft we are told that the three great tenets of a Ma son's profes sion, are Brotherl y Love, Relief, and Truth. And it is true that a Brotherl y affection and kindness s hould govern us in all our intercourse and relations with our brethren; and a generous and liberal philanthrop y actuate us in regard to all men. To relieve the distressed is peculiarl y the dut y of Masons – a sacred dut y, not to be om itted, neglected, or coldl y or inefficient ly complied Page 19 of 621"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike with. It is also most true, that Truth is a Divine attribute and the foundation of ever y virtue. To be true, and to seek to find and learn the Truth, are the great objects of every good Mason. As the Ancients did, Masonry styles Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice, the four cardinal virtues. The y are as necessar y to nations as to individuals. The people that would be Free and Independent, must possess Sagacit y, Forethought, Fore-sight, and careful Circumspection, all which are included in the meaning of the word Prudence. It must be temp erate in asserting its rights, te mperate in its councils, econom ical in its expenses; it must be bold, brave, courageous, patient under reverses, undisma yed by disasters, hopeful amid calamities, like Rome when she sold the field at which Hannibal had his camp. No Cannæ or Pharsalia or Pavia or Agincourt or Waterloo must discourage her. Let her Senate sit in their seats until the Gauls pluck the m by the beard. She must, above all things, be ju st, not truckling to the strong and warring on or plundering the weak; she must act on the square with all nations, and the feeblest tribes; always keeping her faith, honest in her legislation, upright in all her dealings. Whenever such a Republic exists, it will be immortal: for rashness, inju stice, intemperance and luxury in prosperity, and despair and disorder in adversit y, are the causes of the deca y and dilapida tion of nations.

IN the Ancient Orient, all religion was more or less a m ystery and there was no divorce from it of philosoph y. The popular theolog y, taking the mul titude of allegories and symbols for realit ies, degenerated into a worship of the celestial luminaries, of imaginary Deities with hum an feelings, passions, appetit es, and lusts, of idols, stones, ani mals, reptiles. The Onion was sacred to the Egyptians, because its different layers were a symbol of the concentric heavenl y spheres. Of course the popular religion could not satisfy the deeper longings and thoughts, the loftier aspirations of the Spirit, or the logic of reason. The first, therefore, was taught to the initiated in the Mysteries. There, also, it was taught by symbols. The vagueness of sy mbolism, capable of man y interpretations, reached what the palpable and conventional creed could not. Its indefiniten ess acknowledged the abstruseness of the subject: it treated that mysterious subject m ystically: it endeavored to illustrat e what it could not explain; to excite an appropriate feeling , if it could not develop an adequate idea ; and to mak e the image a mere subordinate convey ance for the conception, which itself never beca me obvious or famil iar. Thus the knowledge now impar ted by books and letters, was of old convey ed by symbols; and the priests invented or perpetuated a displa y of rites and exhibitions, which were not only more attractive to the e ye than words, but often more suggestive and more pregnant with meaning to the mind. Masonry , successor of the M ysteries, still follows the ancient manner of teaching. Her ceremonies are like the ancient mystic shows, – not the reading of an essay , but the opening of a proble m, requiring research, and constituting philosoph y the arch- expounder. Her symbols are the instruction she gives. The lectures are endeavors, often partial and one-sided, to interpret these s ymbols. He who w ould become an acco mplished Mason must not be content merely to hear, or even to understand, the lectures; he must, aided by them, and they having, as it were, m arked out the wa y for him, study, interpret, and develop these symbols for himse lf. * * * * * * Though Masonry is identica l with the ancient Mysteries, it is so onl y in this qualified sense: that it presents but an imperfe ct image of their brillianc y, the ruins onl y of their grandeur, and a s ystem that has experienced progressive alterat ions, the fruits of social events, political circums tances, and the amb itious imbecility of its improvers. After leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were modifi ed by the habits of the different nations among whom they were introduced, and especial ly by the religious systems of the countries into which they were transplanted. To maintain the established governm ent, laws, and religion, was the obligation of the Initiate everywhere; and ever ywhere they were the heritage of the priests, who were nowhere willing to make the com mon people co-proprietors with themselves of philosophical truth. Masonry is not the Coliseum in ruins. It is rather a Roman palace of the middle ages, disfigured by modern archite ctural improve ments, yet built on a Cyclopæan foundation Page 21 of 621"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike laid by the Etruscans, and with man y a stone of the superstructure taken from dwellings and temples of the age of Hadrian and Antoninus. Christianit y taught the doctrine of FRATERNITY; but repudiated that of politic al EQUALITY, by continuall y inculcating obedience to Cæsar, and to those lawfull y in authorit y. Masonry was the first apostle of EQUALITY. In the Monaster y there is fraternity and equality , but no liberty . Masonry added that also, and clai med for man the three-fold heritage, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, and FRATERNITY. It was but a developm ent of the original purpose of the Mysteries, which was to teach men to know and practice their duties to themse lves and their fellows, the great practical end of all philosoph y and all knowledge. Truths are the springs from which duties flow; and it is but a few hundred years since a new Truth began to be distinctl y seen; that MAN IS S UPREME OVER IN STITUTIONS, AND NOT THEY O VER HIM. Man has natural empire over all institutions. They are for him, according to his develop ment; not he for them. This seems to us a very simple statement, one to which all men, everywhere, ought to assent. But once it was a great new Truth, – -not revealed until governments had been in existence for at least five thousand years. Once revealed, it imposed new duties on men. Man owed it to himself to be free. He owed it to his countr y to seek to give her freedom, or maintain her in that posses sion. It made Tyranny and Usurpation the enemies of the Human Race. It created a general outlawr y of Despots and Despotisms, tempora l and spiritual. The sphere of Dut y was immensely enlarged. Patriotism had, henceforth, a new and wider me aning. Free Governmen t, Free Thought, Free Conscience, Free Speech! All these came to be inalienable rights, which those who had parted with them or been robbed of the m, or whose ancestors had lost them, had the right summ arily to retake. Unfortunatel y, as Truths always become perverted into falsehoods, and are falsehoods when misapp lied, this Truth became the Gospel of Anarchy , soon after it was first preached. Masonry early comprehend ed this Truth, and recognized its own enlarged duties. Its symbols then came to have a wider me aning; but it also assumed the mask of Stone- masonr y, and borro wed its working-tools, and so was supplied with new and apt symbols. It aided in bringing about the French Revolution, disappeared with the Girondists, was born again with the restoration of order, and sustained Napoleon, because, though Emperor, he acknowledged the right of the people to select its rulers, and was at the head of a nation refusing to receive back its old kings. H e pleaded, with sabre, musket, and cannon, the great cause of the People against Royalty, the right of the French people even to make a Corsican General their Emperor, if it pleased them. Masonry felt that this Truth had the Omnipotence of God on its side; and that neither Pope nor Potentate could overco me it. It was a truth dropped into the world's wide treasury , and forming a part of the heritage which each generation receives, enlarges, and holds in trust, and of necessity bequeaths to mank ind; the personal estate of man, entailed of nature to the end of time. And Masonr y early recognized it as true, that to set forth and develop a truth, or any human excellen ce of gift or growth, is to mak e greater the spiritual glory of the race; that whosoever aids the march of a Truth, and makes the thought a thing, writes in the same line with MO SES, and with Him who died upon the cross, and has an intelle ctual sympathy with the Deity Himself.

Not that Philosophy or Science is in opposition to Religion. For Philosoph y is but that knowledge of God and the Soul, which is derived from observation of the man ifested action of God and the Soul, and from a wise analog y. It is the intellectu al guide which the religious sentiment needs. The true religious philosophy of an imperfec t being, is not a system of creed, but, as SOCRATES thought, an infinite search or approxim ation. Philosoph y is that intellectual and moral progress, which the religious sentimen t inspires and ennobles. As to Science, it could not walk alone, while religion was stationar y. It consists of those matured inferences from experience which all other experience confirms. It realizes and unites all that was truly valuable in both the old schemes of med iation, – one heroic , or the system of action and effort; and the mystical theory of spiritual, contemp lative communion. \"Listen to me,\" says GALEN, \"as to the voice of the Eleusinian Hierophant, and believe that the stud y of Nature is a mystery no less importan t than theirs, nor less adapted to display the wisdom and power of the Great Creator.

Evidence to the contrar y, supplied b y what another man informs us that this Soul has said to his, would weigh little against the former. The first Scriptures for the human race were written by God on the Earth and Heavens. The reading of these Scriptures is Science. Familiarity with the grass and trees, the insects and the infusoria, teaches us deeper lessons of love and faith than we can glean from the writings of FĒNĒLON and AUGUSTINE. The great Bible of God is ever open before mankind. Knowledge is convertibl e into power, and axioms into rules of utilit y and dut y. But knowledge itself is not Po wer. Wisdom is Power; and her Prime Minister is JUSTICE, which is the perfected law of TRUTH. The purpose, therefore, of Education and Science is to make a man wise. If knowledge does not make him so, it is wasted, like water poured on the sands. To know the formulas of Masonry, is of as littl e value, by itself, as to know so many words and sentences in some barbarous African or Australasian dialect. To know even the meaning of the s ymbols, is but little, unless that adds to our wisdom, and also to our charit y, which is to ju stice like one hem isphere of the brain to the other. Do not lose sight, then, of the true object of your studies in Masonry . It is to add to y our estate of wisdom, and not mere ly to your knowledge. A man may spend a lifetime in studying a single specialt y of knowledge, – botan y, concholog y, or entomo logy, for instance, – in committing to memory names derived from the Greek, and classify ing and reclassif ying; and yet be no wi ser than when he began. It is the great truths as to all that most concerns a man, as to his rights, interests, and duties, that Masonry seeks to teach her Initiates. Page 23 of 621"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The wiser a man becomes, the less will he be inclined to submit tamely to the imposit ion of fetters or a yoke, on his conscience or his person. For, by increase of wisdom he not only better knows his rights, but the more highly values them, and is mor e conscious of his worth and dignity. His pride then urges him to assert his independenc e. He becom es better able to assert it also; and better able to assist others or his countr y, when they or she stake all, even existence, upon the same assertion. But mere knowledge makes no one independent, nor fits him to be free. It often only makes him a more useful slave. Liberty is a curse to the ignorant and brutal. Politica l science has for its object to ascertain in what manner and by means of what institutions political and personal freedom may be secured and perpetuated: not license, or the mere right of ever y man to vote, but entire and absolute freedom of thought and opinion, alike free of the despotism of monarch and mob and prelate ; freedom of action within the limits of the general law enacted for all; the Courts of Ju stice, with impartial Judges and ju ries, open to all alike; weaknes s and poverty equally potent in those Courts as power and wealth; the avenues to office and honor open alike to all the worthy ; the military powers, in war o r peace , in strict subordination to the civil power; arbitrar y arrests for acts not known to the law as cri mes, impossibl e; Romish Inquisitions, Star- Chambers, Militar y Commissions, unknown; the me ans of instruction within reach of the children of all; the right of Free Speech; and accountabi lity of all public officers, civil and mil itary. If Masonry needed to be ju stified for imposing politica l as well as moral duties on its Initiates, it would be enough to point to the sad history of the world. It would not even need that she should turn back the pages of histor y to the chapters written by Tacitus: that she should recite the incredible horrors of despotism under Caligula and Domit ian, Caracall a and Com modus, Vitellius and Maxim in. She need only point to the centuries of calamity through which the gay French nation passed; to the long oppression of the feudal ages, of the selfish Bourbon kings; to those ti mes when the peasants were robbed and slaughtered by their own lords and princes, like sheep; when the lord claim ed the first- fruits of the peasant's marr iage-bed; when the captured city was given up to mer ciless rape and massacre; when the State-prisons groaned with innocent victims, and the Church blessed the banners of pitiless murderers, and sang Te Deums for the crowning merc y of the Eve of St. Bartholom ew. We might turn over the pages, to a later chapter, – that of the reign of the Fifteenth Louis, when y oung girls, hardly more than children, were kidnapped to serve his lusts; when lettres de cachet filled the Bastile with person s accused of no crim e, with husbands who were in the wa y of the pleasures of lascivious wives and of villains wearing orders of nobility; when the people were ground between the upper and the nether millstone of taxes, customs, and excises; and when Me Pope's Nuncio and the Cardinal de la Roche-A yman, devoutl y kneeling, one on each side of Madame du Barr y, the king's abandoned prostitute, put the slippers on her naked feet, as she rose from the adulterous bed. Then, indeed, suffering and toil were the two forms of man, and the people were but beasts of burden. The true Mason is he who labors strenuousl y to help his Order effect its great purposes. Not that the Order can effect them by itself; but that it, too, can help. It also is one of God's instrum ents. It is a Force and a Power; and shame upon it, if it did not exert itself, and, if need be, sacrifice its children in the cause of human ity, as Abraham was ready to offer up Isaac on the altar of sacrifice. It will not forget that noble allegor y of Curtius leaping, all in Page 24 of 621"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike armor, into the great yawning gulf that opened to swallow Rome. It will TRY. It shall not be its fault if the day never comes when man will no longer have to fear a conquest, an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalr y of nations with the arm ed hand, an interruption of civilization depending on a marr iage-royal, or a birth in the hereditar y tyrannies; a partition of the peoples b y a Congres s, a dism emberment by the downfall of a dy nasty, a combat of two religions, meeting head to head, like two goats of darkness on the bridge of the Infinite: When the y will no longer have to fear famine, spoliation, prostitution from distress, miser y from lack of work, and all the brigandages of chance in the forest of events: when nations will gravitat e about the Truth, like stars about the light, each in its own orbit, without clashing or collision; and every where Freedom, cinctured with stars, crowned with the celesti al splendors, and with wisdom and justice on either hand, will reign supreme. In your studies as a Fellow-Craft you must be guided by REASON, LOVE and FAITH. We do not now discus s the differences between Reason and Faith, and undertake to define the domain of each. But it is necessary to say, that even in the ordinar y affairs of life we are governed far more by what we believe than by what we know ; by FAITH and ANALOGY, than b y REASO N. The \"Age of Reason\" of the French Revolution taught, we know, what a foll y it is to enthrone Reason b y itself as supreme. Reason is at fault when it deals with the Infinite. There we must revere and believe. Notwithstanding the calamities of the virtuous, the miseries of the deserving, the prosperit y of tyrants and the murder of martyrs, we must believe there is a wise, just, merc iful, and loving God, an Intellig ence and a Providence, supreme over all, and caring for the minutest things and events. A Faith is a necessit y to man. Woe to him who believes nothing! We believe that the soul of another is of a certain nature and posses ses certain qualities, that he is generous and honest, or penurious and knavish, that she is virtuous and am iable, or vicious and ill- tempered, from the countenanc e alone, from little more than a glimpse of it, without the me ans of knowing . We venture our fortune on the signature of a man on the other side of the world, whom we never saw, upon the belief that he is honest and trustworth y. We believe that occurrences have taken place, upon the assertion of others. We believe that one will acts upon another, and in the reality of a mul titude of other phenom ena that Reason cannot explain. But we ought not to believe what Reason authorita tively denies, that at which the sense of right revolts, that which is absurd or self-contradictor y, or at issue with experienc e or science, or that which degrades the charact er of the Deity, and would m ake Him revengeful, malignant, cruel, or unjust. A man's Faith is as much his own as his Reason is. Hi s Freedom consists as much in his faith being free as in his will being uncontrolled by power. All the Priests and Augurs of Rome or Greece had not the right to require Cicero or Socrates to believe in the absurd mythology of the vulgar. All the Imau ms of Mohamm edanism have not the right to require a Pagan to believe that Gabriel dictated the Koran to the Prophet. All the Brahmins that ever lived, if assembled in one conclave like the Cardinals, could not gain a right to compel a single human being to believe in the Hindu Cosmogon y. No man or body of men can be infallible, and authorized to decide what other men shall believe, as to an y tenet of faith. Except to those who first receive it, every religion and the truth of all inspired writings Page 25 of 621"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike depend on human testimony and internal evidences, to be judged of b y Reason and the wise analogies of Faith. Each man must necessaril y have the right to judge of their truth for himself; because no one m an can have an y higher or better right to judge than another of equal inform ation and intellig ence. Domitian claimed to be the Lord God; and statues and images of him, in silver and gold, were found throughout the known world. He clai med to be regarded as the God of all m en; and, according to Suetonius, began his letters thus: \" Our L ord and God com mands that it should be done s o and so ;\" and formal ly decreed that no one should address him otherwise, either in writing or by word of mouth. Palfurius Sura, the philosopher, who was his chief delator, accusing those who refused to recognize his divinit y, however mu ch he may have believed in that divinity, had not the right to demand that a single Christian in Rome or the provinces should do the same. Reason is far from being the onl y guide, in mor als or in politic al science. Love or loving- kindness must keep it compan y, to exclude fanaticis m, intolerance, and persecution, to all of which a moral ity too ascetic, and extre me political principles, invariabl y lead. We must also have faith in ourselves, and in our fellows and the people, or we shall be easily discouraged by reverses, and our ardor cooled b y obstacles. We must not listen to Reason alone. Force com es more from Faith and Love: and it is by the aid of these that man scales the loftiest heights of morali ty, or beco mes the Saviour and Redee mer of a People. Reason must hold the helm; but these supply the mot ive power. The y are the wings of the soul. Enthusias m is generall y unreasoning; and without it, and Love and Faith, there would have been no RIENZI, or TELL, or SYD NEY, or an y other of the great patriots whose names are immortal. If the Deit y had been merely and onl y All-wise and All-migh ty, He would never have created the Universe. * * * * * * It is GENIUS that gets Po wer; and its pri me lieuten ants are FORCE and WISDOM. The unruliest of men bend before the leader that has the sense to see and the will to do. It is Genius that rules with God-like Power; that unveils, with its counsellors, the hidden human mysteries, cuts asunder with its word the huge knots, and builds up with its word the crumbled ruins. At its glance fall down the senseless idols, who se altars have been on all the high places and in all the sacred groves. Dishonesty and imbecility stand abashed before it. Its single Yea or Na y revokes the wrongs of ages, and is heard among the future generations. Its power is im mense, because its wisdom is immense. Genius is the Sun of the politica l sphere. Force and Wisdom, its ministers, are the orbs that carry its light into darkness, and answer it with their solid reflect ing Truth. Develop ment is symbolized by the use of the Mallet and Chisel; the developm ent of the energies and intell ect, of the individual and the people. Genius m ay place itself at the head of an unintellectu al, uneducated, unenergetic nation; but in a free countr y, to cultivat e the intellect of those who elect, is the only mode of securing intellect and genius for rulers. The world is seldom ruled by the great spirits, except after dissolution and new birth In periods of transition and convulsion, the Long Parliam ents, the Robespierres and Marats, and the semi- respectabili ties of intell ect, too often hold the reins of po wer. The Cromwel ls and Napoleons come later. After Marius and Sulla and Cicero the rhetorici an, CÆSAR. The great intellec t is often too sharp for the granite of this life. Legislators may be very Page 26 of 621"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike ordinar y men; for legislation is very ordinary work; it is but the final issue of a mi llion minds. The power of the purse or the sword, comp ared to that of the spirit, is poor and contemptible. As to lands , you may have agrarian laws, and equal partit ion. But a man's intellect is all his own, held direct from God, an inalien able fief. It is the most potent of weapons in the hands of a paladin. If the people comprehend Force in the physical sense, how much more do they reverence the intellectu al! Ask Hildebrand, or Luther, or Loy ola. They fall prostrate before it, as before an idol. The master y of mind over m ind is the only conquest worth having. The other injures both, and dissolves at a breath; rude as it is, the great cable falls down and snaps at last. But this dim ly resembl es the dom inion of the Creator. It does not need a subject like that of Peter the Hermi t. If the stream be but bright and strong, it will sweep like a spring-tide to the popular heart. Not in word onl y, but in intellectual act lies the fascination. It is the homage to the Invisible. This power, knotted with Love, is the golden chain let down into the well of Truth, or the invisible chain that binds the ranks of mankind together. Influence of man over man is a law of nature, whether it be by a great estate in land or in intellect. It may mean slavery, a deference to the em inent human judgment. Society hangs spirituall y together, like the revolving spheres above. The free country , in which intellect and genius govern, will endure. Where they serve, and other influences govern, the national life is short. All the nations that have tried to govern the mselves by their smallest, by the incapables, or merely respectables, have come to nought. Constitutions and Laws, without Genius and Intellec t to govern, will not prevent decay. In that case they have the dry-rot and the life dies out of them by degrees. To give a nation the franchise of the Intelle ct is the only sure mode of perpetuating freedom. This will compe l exertion and generous care for the people from those on the higher seats, and honorable and intell igent allegianc e from those below. Then political public life will protect all men from self-abasem ent in sensual pursuits, from vulgar acts and low greed, b y giving the noble ambition of just imperial rule. To elevate the people by teaching loving-kindness and wisdom, with power to him who teaches best: and so to develop the free State from the rough ashlar: this is the great labor in which Masonry desires to lend a helping hand. All of us should labor in building up the great monum ent of a nation, the Holy House of the Temple. The cardinal virtues must not be partitioned among men, becom ing the exclusive propert y of some, like the common crafts. ALL are apprenticed to the partners, Duty and Honor. Masonry is a march and a struggle toward the Light. For the individual as well as the nation, Light is Virtue, Manliness, Intelligen ce, Liberty. Tyranny over the soul or body , is darkness. The freest people, like the freest man, is alway s in danger of re-lapsing into servitude. Wars are almost always fatal to Republics. They create tyrants, and consolidate their power. The y spring, for the most part, from evil counsels. When the small and the base are intrusted with power, legislation and adm inistration become but two parallel series of errors and blunders, ending in war, calam ity, and the necessit y for a tyrant. When the nation feels its feet sliding backward, as if it walked on the ice, the time has come for a supreme effort. The magnif icent tyrants of the past are but the types of those of the future. Page 27 of 621"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Men and nations will always sell the mselves into slaver y, to gratif y their passions and obtain revenge. The tyrant's plea, necessity , is alwa ys availab le; and the tyrant once in power, the necessit y of providing for his safet y makes him savage. Religion is a power, and he must control that. Independent, its sanctuaries might rebel. Then it beco mes unlawful for the people to worship God in their own way , and the old spiritual despotisms revive. Men must believe as Power wills, or die; and even if they may believe as they will, all they have, lands, houses, bod y, and soul, are stamped with the royal brand. \" I am the State ,\" said Louis the Fourteenth to his peasants; \" the very shirts on your backs are mine, and I can take them if I will .\" And dy nasties so established endure, like that of the Cæsars of Rome, of the Cæsars of Constantinople, of the Caliphs, the Stuarts, the Spaniards, the Goths, the Valois, until the race wears out, and ends with lunatics and idiots, who still rule. There is no concord among men, to end the horrible bondage. The State falls inwardly , as well as by the outward blows of the incoherent elements. The furious human passions, the sleeping human indolence, the stolid human ignorance, the rivalr y of human castes, are as good for the kings as the swords of the Paladins. The worshippers have all bowed so long to the old idol, that they cannot go into the streets and choose another Grand Lla ma. And so the effete State floats on down the puddled stream of Tim e, until the tempest or the tidal sea discovers that the worm has consumed its strength, and it crumbles into oblivion. * * * * * * Civil and religious Freedo m must go hand in hand; and Per secution matures them both. A people content with the thoughts made for the m by the priests of a church will be content with Royalty by Divine Right, – the Church and the Throne mutually sustaining each other. They will smother schism and reap infidelit y and indifference; and while the battle for freedo m goes on around the m, they will onl y sink the more apathetic ally into servitude and a deep trance, perhaps occasionall y interrupted by furious fits of frenz y, followed b y helpless exhaustion. Despotism is not difficult in any land that has only known one master from its childhood; but there is no harder problem than to perfect and perpetuate free governm ent by the people themselves; for it is not one king that is needed: all must be kings. It is easy to set up Masaniello, that in a few day s he may fall lower than before. But free government grows slo wly, like the individual human faculties; and like the forest-trees, from the inner heart outward. Libert y is not only the common birth-right, but it is lost as well by non-user as by mis-user. It depends far more on the universal effort than an y other human property . It has no single shrine or hol y well of pilgri mage for the nation; for its waters should burst out freely from the whole soil. The free popular power is one that is only known in its strength in the hour of adversit y: for all its trials, sacrifices and expectations are its own. It is trained to think for itself, and also to act for itself. When the enslaved people prostrate themselves in the dust before the hurricane, like the alarmed beasts of the field, the free people stand erect before it, in all the strength of unit y, in self- reliance, in mutual reliance, with effronter y against all but the visible hand of God. It is neither cast down by calamity nor elated by success. Page 28 of 621"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike This vast power of endurance, of forbearance, of patience, and of performan ce, is only acquired by continual exercise of all the functions, like the healthful physical human vigor, like the individual moral vigor. And the maxim is no less true than old, that eternal vigilance is the price of libert y. It is curious to observe the universal pretext by which the tyrants of all times take away the national liberties. It is stated in the statutes of Edward II., that the justices and the sheriff should no longer be elected by the people, on account of the riots and dissensions which had arisen. The same reason was given long before for the suppre ssion of popular election of the bishops; and there is a witness to this untruth in the yet older times, when Rome lost her freedom, and her indignant citizens declared that tumultuous liberty is better than disgraceful tranquill ity. * * * * * * With the Compasses and Scale, we can trace all the figures used in the mathematics of planes, or in what are called GEOMETRY and TRIGON OMETRY, two words that are themselves deficien t in meaning. GEOMETRY, which the letter G. in most Lodges is said to signify , means measure ment of land or the earth – or Survey ing; and TRIGON OMETRY, the measure ment of triangles, or figures with three sides or angles. The latter is by far the most appropriate name for the science intended to be expressed b y the word \" Geometry.\" Neither is of a m eaning sufficient ly wide: for although the vast surveys of great spaces of the earth's surface, and of coasts, b y which shipwreck and calamity to mariners are avoided, are effected by means of triangula tion; – though it was by the same method that the French astronomers measured a degree of latitud e and so established a scale of me asures on an im mutable basis; though it is by means of the immense triangle that has for its base a line drawn in imagin ation between the place of the earth now and its place six mon ths hence in space, and for its apex a planet or star, that the distance of Jupiter or Sirius from the earth is ascertained; and though there is a triangle still more vast, its base extending either way from us, with and past the horizon into immensity, and its apex infinite ly distant above us; to which corresponds a sim ilar infinite triangle below – what is above equalling what is below, immensity equalling immensity ; – yet the Science of Numbers, to which Pythagoras attached so much importance, and who se mysteries are found every where in the ancient religions, and most of all in the Kabalah and in the Bible, is not sufficientl y expressed b y either the word \" Geometry \" or the word \" Trigonometry .\" For that science includes these, with Arithmetic, and also with Algebra, Logarith ms, the Integral and Differential Calculus; and by means of it are worked out the great problems of Astronom y or the Laws of the Stars. * * * * * * Virtue is but heroic bravery, to do the thing thought to be true, in spite of all enemies of flesh or spirit, in despite of all temptations or mena ces. Man is accountable for the uprightness of his doctrine, but not for the rightness of it. Devout enthusiasm is far easier than a good action. The end of thought is action; the sole purpose of Religion is an Ethic. Theory, in politic al science, is worthless, except for the purpose of being realiz ed in practice. In every credo , religious or political as in the soul of man, there are two regions, the Dialectic and the Ethic; and it is only when the two are harmoniousl y blended, that a Page 29 of 621"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike perfect discipline is evolved. There are men who dialec tically are Christians, as there are a multitude who dialecti cally are Masons, and y et who are ethicall y Infidels, as these are ethically of the Profane, in the strictest sense: – intel lectual believers, but practical atheists: – men who will write you \"Evidences,\" in perfect faith in their logic, but cannot carry out the Christian or Masonic doctrine, owing to the strength, or weaknes s, of the flesh. On the other hand, there are many dialect ical skeptics, but ethical believers, as there are many Masons w ho have never undergone initiation ; and as ethics are the end and purpose of religion, so are ethical believers the most worthy. He who does right is better than he who thinks right. But you must not act upon the hypothesis that all men are hypocrites, whose conduct does not square with their sentim ents. No vice is more rare, for no task is more difficult, than systematic hypocrisy. When the Demagogue becomes a Usurper it does not follow that he was all the time a hypocrite. Shallow men only so judge of others. The truth is, that creed has, in general, very little influence on the conduct; in religion, on that of the individual; in politics, on that of part y. As a general thing, the Mahometan, in the Orient, is far more honest and trustworthy than the Christian. A Gospel of Love in the mouth, is an Avatar of Persecution in the heart. Men who believe in eternal damna tion and a literal sea of fire and bri mstone, incur the certain ty of it, according to their creed, on the slightest temptation of appetit e or passion. Predestination insists on the necessit y of good works. In Ma sonry, at the least flow of passion, one speaks ill of another behind his back: and so far from the \"Brotherhood\" of Blue Masonry being real, and the solemn pledges contained in the use of the word \"Brother\" being complied with, extraordinar y pains are taken to show that Masonry is a sort of abstraction, which scorns to interfere in worldly matters. The rule may be regarded as universal, that, where there is a choice to be made, a Mason will give his vote and influence, in politics and business, to the less qualified profane in preference to the better qualified Mason. O ne will take an oath to oppose an y unlawful usurpation of power, and then beco me the ready and even eager instrumen t of a usurper. Another will call one \"Brother,\" and then play toward him the part of Judas Iscariot, or strike him, as Joab did Abner, under the fifth rib, with a lie whose authorship is not to be traced. Masonry does not change human nature, and cannot mak e honest m en out of born knaves. While you are still engaged in preparation, and in accu mulating principles for future use, do not forget the words of the Apostle James: \"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass, for he beholdeth himself, and goeth awa y, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was; but who so looketh into the perfect law of libert y, and continueth, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his work. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain... Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being an abstraction. A man is justified by works, and not by faith only... The devils believe, – and tremb le... As the bod y without the heart is dead, so is faith without works.\" * * * * * * In politic al science, also, free governm ents are erected and free constitutions framed, upon some simple and intelligib le theory. Upon w hatever theory they are based, no sound Page 30 of 621"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike conclusion is to be reached except by carrying the theor y out without flinching, both in argument on constitut ional questions and in practic e. Shrink from the true theory through timidity, or wander from it through want of the logical faculty, or transgress against it through passion or on the plea of necessit y or expedienc y, and you have denial or invasion of rights, laws that offend against first principles, usurpation of illegal powers, or abnegation and abdication of legitim ate authorit y. Do not forget, either, that as the showy , superficia l, impudent and self-conceited will almost always be preferred, even in utmost stress of danger and cala mity of the State, to the man of solid learning, large intellec t, and catholi c sympathies, because he is nearer the common popular and legislativ e level, so the highest truth is not acceptab le to the mass of mankind. When SOLON wa s asked if he had given his countr ymen the best laws, he answered, \" The best they are capable of receiving .\" This is one of the profoundest utterances on record; and yet like all great truths, so simple as to be rarel y compreh ended. It contains the whole philosoph y of History. It utters a truth which, had it been recognized, would have saved men an immensity of vain, idle disputes, and have led them into the clearer paths of knowledge in the Past. It means this, – that all truths are Truths of Period , and not truths for eternit y; that whatever great fact has had strength and vital ity enough to make itself real, whether of religion, morals, govern ment, or of w hatever else, and to find place in this world, has been a truth for the time, and as good a s men were capable of receiving . So, too, with great men. The intellec t and capaci ty of a people has a single measure, – that of the great men whom Providence gives it, and whom it receives . There have alwa ys been men too great for their time or their people. Every people mak es such men only its idols, as it is capable of compr ehending. To impose ideal truth or law upon an incapable and merely real man, must ever be a vain and empty speculation. The laws of s ympathy govern in this as they do in regard to men who are put at the head. We do not know, as ye t, what qualificat ions the sheep insist on in a leader. With men who are too high intelle ctually, the mass have as littl e sympathy as they have with the stars. When BUR KE, the wisest states man England ever had, rose to speak, the House of Com mons was depopulated as upon an agreed signal. There is as little sympathy between the mass and the highest TRUTH S. The highest truth, being incomprehensib le to the man of realities, as the highest man is, and largel y above his level, will be a great unrealit y and falsehood to an unintelle ctual man. The profoundest doctrines of Christianit y and Philosophy would be m ere jargon and babble to a Potawato mie Indian. The popular explanat ions of the s ymbols of Masonr y are fitting for the mu ltitude that have swarmed into the Temples, – being full y up to the level of their capacit y. Catholicis m was a vital truth in its earliest ages, but it became obsolete, and Protestantism arose, flourished, and deteriorated. The doctrines of ZORO ASTER were the best which the ancient Persians were fitted to receive; those of CO NFUCI US were fitted for the Chinese; those of MOHAMMED for the idolatrous Arabs of his age. Each was Truth for the time. Each was a GOSPEL, preached by a REFORMER; and if any men are so little fortunate as to rem ain content therewith, when others have attain ed a higher truth, it is their misfortun e and not their fault. They are to be pitied for it, and not persecuted.

You can hardl y get two men in any Congress or Convention to agree; – nay, you can rarely get one to agree with himself .

When he lives, is he free from pain? D o the diseases not clai m him as their prey? When he dies, can he escape the com mon grave? Pride is not the heritage of man. Humility should dwell with frailt y, and atone for ignorance, error and imp erfection. Neither should the Mason be over-anxious for office and honor, however certain ly he may feel that he has the capacit y to serve the State. He should neither seek nor spurn honors. It is good to enjoy the blessings of fortune; it is better to submit without a pang to their loss. The greatest deeds are not done in the glare of light, and before the eyes of the populace. He whom God has gifted with a love of retirem ent possesses, as it were, an additional sense; and among the vast and noble scenes of nature, we find the balm for the wounds w e have received among the pitiful shifts of polic y; for the attach ment to solitude is the surest preservative from the ills of life. But Resignation is the more noble in proportion as it is the less pas sive. Retirem ent is only a morbid selfishness, if it prohibit exertions for others; as it is only dignified and noble, when it is the shade whence the oracles issue that are to instruct mankind ; and retire ment of this nature is the sole seclusion which a good and wise man will covet or comm and. The very philosophy which makes such a man covet the quiet , will m ake him eschew the inutili ty of the herm itage.

Remember, also, that there is an education which quickens the Intellect, and leaves the heart hollower or harder than before. There are ethical lessons in the laws of the heavenl y bodies, in the properties of earthl y elements, in geograph y, chemistr y, geology , and all the material sciences. Things are symbols of Truths. Properties are symbols of Truths. Science, not teaching moral and spiritual truths, is dead and dry, of little more real value than to commit to the memory a long row of unconnected dates, or of the nam es of bugs or butterfli es. Christianit y, it is said, begins from the burning of the false gods b y the people the mselves. Education begins with the burning of our intell ectual and moral idols: our prejudices, notions, conceits, our worthless or ignoble purposes. Especiall y it is necessary to shake off the love of worldl y gain. With Freedom comes the longing for worldly advancem ent. In that race men are ever falling, rising, running, and falling again. The lust for wealth and the abject dread of povert y delve the furrows on man y a noble brow. The gamb ler grows old as he watches the chances. Lawful hazard drives Y outh away before its time; and this Youth draws heavy bills of exchange on Age. Men live, like the engines, at high pressure, a hundred years in a hundred months; the ledger becomes the Bible, and the day-book the Book of the Morning Pray er. Hence flow overreachings and sharp practice, heartless traffic in which the capitalist buys profit with the lives of the laborers, speculations that coin a nation's agonies into wealth, and all the other devilish enginery of Mam mon. This, and greed for office, are the two columns at the entrance to the Temple of Moloch. It is doubtful whether the latter, blossoming in falsehood, tricker y, and fraud, is not even more pernicious than the former. At all events they are twins, and fitl y mated; and as either gains control of the unfortunate subject, his soul withers awa y and deca ys, and at last dies out.

Elements and principles are mingled, combin ed, espoused, mul tiplied one by another, to such a degree as to bring the material world and the moral world into the same light. Phenomena are perpetuall y folded back upon themselves. In the vast cosmi cal changes the universal life comes and goes in unknown quantiti es, enveloping all in the invisible mystery of the em anations, losing no dream from no single sleep, sowing an ani malcule here, crumb ling a star there, oscillating and winding in curves; mak ing a force of Light, and an ele ment of Thought; dissemina ted and indivisible, dissolving all save that point without length, breadth, or thickness, The MYSELF; reducing everything to the Soul-ato m; making everything blossom into God; entangling all activiti es, from the highest to the lowest, in the obscurit y of a dizz ying mechanism; hanging the flight of an insect upon the movem ent of the earth; subordinating, perhaps, if only by the identity of the law, the eccentric evolutions of the come t in the firmament, to the whirlings of the infusoria in the drop of water. A mechan ism made of mind, the first motor of which is the gnat, and its last wheel the zodiac. A peasant- boy, guiding Blücher by the right one of two roads, the other being i mpassable for artill ery, enables him to reach Waterloo in time to save Wellington from a defeat that would have been a rout; and so enables the kings to imprison Napoleon on a barren rock in mid-ocean. An unfaithful smith, by the slovenly shoeing of a horse, causes his lam eness, and, he stumbling, the career of his world-conquering rider ends, and the destinies of empires are changed. A generous officer permits an impr isoned monarch to end his game of chess before leading him to the block; and meanwhile the usurper dies, and the prisoner reascends the throne.

FAUST, with his types, or LUTHER, with his sermons, worked greater results than Alexander or Hannibal. A single thought someti mes suffices to overturn a d ynasty. A silly song did more to unseat James the Second than the acquitt al of the Bishops.

Remember, that though life is short, Thought and the influences of what we do or say are immortal; and that no calculus has yet pretended to ascertain the law of proportion between cause and effect. The hammer of an English blacksmi th, smiting down an insolent official, led to a rebellion which ca me near being a revolution. The word well spoken, the deed fitly done, even b y the feeblest or humblest, cannot help but have their effect. More or less, the effect is inevitab le and eternal. The echoes of the greatest deeds ma y die awa y like the echoes of a cry among the cliffs, and what has been done seem to the human judgment to have been without result. The unconsidered act of the poorest of men may fire the train that leads to the subterranean mine, and an emp ire be rent by the explosion. The power of a free people is often at the disposal of a single and seem ingly an unimpor tant individual; – a terrible and truthful power; for such a people feel with one heart, and therefore can lift up their myriad arms for a single blow. And, again, there is no graduated scale for the measure ment of the influences of different intellects upon the popular mind. Peter the Hermit held no office, yet what a work he wrought! * * * * * * From the politica l point of view there is but a single principle, – the sovereignt y of man over himself. This sovereignt y of one's self over one's self is called LIBERTY. Where two or several of these sovereignties associate, the State begins. But in this association there is no abdicat ion. Each sovereignt y parts with a certain portion of itself to form the common right. That portion is the same for all. There is equal contribution by all to the joint sovereignt y. This identi ty of concession which each m akes to all, is EQUALITY. The common right is nothing more or less than the protection of all, pouring its ra ys on each. This protection of each by all, is FRATERNITY. Liberty is the summ it, Equalit y the base. Equali ty is not all vegetat ion on a level, a society of big spears of grass and stunted oaks, a neighborhood of jealousies, emascul ating each other. It is, civill y, all aptitudes having equal opportunit y; political ly, all votes having equal weight; religiousl y, all consciences having equal rights. Equality has an organ; – gratuitous and obligator y instruction. We must begin with the right to the alphabet. The primar y school obligatory upon all; the higher school offered to all. Such is the law. From the same school for all springs equal society. Instruction! Light! all comes from Light, and all returns to it.

We profess to be equal in a Church and in the Lodge: we shall be equal in the sight of God when He j udges the earth. We may well sit on the pavem ent together here, in communion and conference, for the few brief mo ments that constitute life. A Democra tic Governm ent undoubtedl y has its defects, because it is made and administered by men, and not b y the Wise Gods. It cannot be concise and sharp, like the despotic. When its ire is arou sed it develops its latent strength, and the sturdiest rebel trembles. But its habitual domestic rule is tolerant, patient, and indecisive. Men are brought together, first to differ, and then to agree. Affirmation, negation, discussion, solution: these are the me ans of attaining truth. Often the ene my will be at the gates before the babble of the disturbers is drowned in the chorus of consent. In the Legislativ e office deliberation will often defeat decision. Libert y can pla y the fool like the Tyrants. Refined society requires greater minuten ess of regulation ; and the steps of all advancing States are more and more to be picked among the old rubbish and the new materials. The difficult y lies in discovering the right path through the chaos of confu sion. The adjustment of mutu al rights and wrong s is also more difficult in demo cracies. We do not see and estimate the relative importanc e of objects so easily and clearly from the level or the waving land as from the elevation of a lone peak, towering above the plain; for each looks through his own mist. Abject dependence on constituents, also, is too com mon. It is as miser able a thing as abject dependence on a minist er or the favorite of a Tyrant. It is rare to find a man who can speak out the simpl e truth that is in him, honestly and frankly , without fear, favor, or affection, either to Emperor or People. Moreover, in assemblies of men, faith in each other is almost always wanting, unless a terrible pressure of calam ity or danger from without produces cohesion. Hence the constructive power of such assemblies is, generall y deficient. The chief triumphs of modern days, in Europe, have been in pulling down and obliterat ing; not in building up. But Repeal is not Reform. Time must bring with him the Restorer and Rebuilder. Speech, also, is gros sly abused in Republics; and if the use of speech be glorious, its abuse is the most villainous of vices. Rhetoric, Plato says, is the art of ruling the minds of men. But in democr acies it is too common to hide thought in words, to overlay it, to babble nonsense. The gleams and glitter of intell ectual soap-and- water bubbles are mistaken for the rainbow-glories of genius. The worthless p yrites is continuall y mistak en for gold. Even intellect condescends to intell ectual jugglery , balancing thoughts as a juggler balances pipes on his chin. In all Congresses w e have the inexhaustible flow of babble, and Faction's clamorous knaver y in discussion, until the divine power of speech, that privilege of man and great gift of God, is no better than the screech of parrots or the mimicry of monke ys. The mere talker, however fluent, is barren of deeds in the day of trial. There are men voluble as women, and as well skilled in fencing with the tongue: prodigies of speech, misers in deeds. Too much talking, like too much thinking, destroys the power of action. In hum an nature, the thought is only made perfect by deed. Silence is the mother of both. The trump eter is not the bravest of the brave. Steel and not brass wins the day. The great doer of great deeds is most ly slow and slovenl y of speech. There are some men born Page 36 of 621"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and bred to betra y. Patriotism is their trade, and their capital is speech. But no noble spirit can plead like Paul and be false to itself as Judas. Imposture too com monly rules in republics; they seem to be ever in their minorit y; their guardians are self- appointed; and the unjust thrive better than the just. The Despot, like the night-lion roaring, drowns all the clamor of tongues at once, and speech, the birthright of the free man, becom es the bauble of the enslaved. It is quite true that republics only occasionall y, and as it were accidenta lly, select their wisest, or even the less incapable among the incapables, to govern them and legislate for them. If genius, ar med with learning and knowledge, will grasp the reins, the people will reverence it; if it only modestl y offers itself for office, it will be smit ten on the face, even when, in the straits of distress and the agonies of calam ity, it is indispensable to the salvation of the State. Put it upon the track with the showy and superficia l, the conceited, the ignorant, and impuden t, the trickster and charlatan, and the result shall not be a mom ent doubtful. The verdicts of Legislatur es and the People are like the verdicts of juries, – sometimes right by accident. Offices, it is true, are showered, like the rains of Heaven, upon the just and the unjust. The Roman Augurs that used to laugh in each other's faces at the simp licity of the vulgar, were also tickled with their own guile; but no Augur is needed to lead the people astray. They readily deceive themselv es. Let a Republic begin as it ma y, it will not be out of its minorit y before imbecility will be promot ed to high places; and shallow pretence, getting itself puffed into notice, will invade all the sanctuaries. The most unscrupulous partisanship will prevail, even in respect to judicial trusts; and the most unjust appoint ments constantly be made, although every improper promotion not merely confers one undeserved favor, but may make a hundred honest cheeks smart with injustice. The country is stabbed in the front when those are brought into the stalled seats w ho should slink into the dim gallery. Every stamp of Honor, ill- clutched, is stolen from the Treasur y of Merit. Yet the entrance into the public service, and the promot ion in it, affect both the rights of individuals and those of the nation. Injustice in bestowing or withholding office ought to be so intolerab le in democra tic communities that the least trace of it should be like the scent of Treason. It is not universall y true that all citizens of equal character have an equal claim to knock at the door of every public office and demand admittance. When any man presents hi mself for service he has a right to aspire to the highest body at once, if he can show his fitness for such a beginning, – that he is fitter than the rest who offer themselv es for the same post. The entry into it can onl y justly be made through the door of mer it. And whenever any one aspires to and attains such high post, especial ly if by unfair and disreputable and indecent means, and is afterward found to be a signal failure, he should at once be beheaded. He is the worst among the public enemies. When a man sufficient ly reveals himself, all others should be proud to give him due precedence. When the power of promotion is abused in the grand passages of life whether by People, Legislature, or Executive, the unjust decision recoils on the judge at once. That is not only a gross, but a willful shortness of sight, that cannot discover the deserving.

They tend to deca y, do all we can to prevent it, like human bodies. If. the y try the experim ent of governing themse lves by their smallest, they slide downward to the unavoidable abyss with tenfold velocit y; and there never has been a Republic that has not followed that fatal course. But however palpable and gross the inherent defects of demo cratic governm ents, and fatal as the results finall y and inevitabl y are, we need onl y glance at the reigns of Tiberius, Nero, and Caligula, of Heliogabalus and Caracall a, of Domit ian and Corn-modus, to recognize that the difference between freedom and despotism is as wide as that between Heaven and Hell. The cruelt y, baseness, and insanit y of tyrants are incredibl e. Let him who complains of the fickle humors and inconstanc y of a free people, read Pliny's character of Domitian. If the great man in a Republic cannot win office without descending to low arts and whining beggary and the judicious use of sneaking lies, let him remain in retire ment, and use the pen. Tacitus and Juvenal held no office. Let History and Satire punish the pretender as they crucify the despot. The revenges of the intelle ct are terrible and just. Let Masonry use the pen and the printing- press in the free State against the Demagogue; in the Despotism against the Tyrant. History offers exa mples and encouragem ent. All history , for four thousand years, being filled with violated rights and the sufferings of the people, each period of history brings with it such protest as is possible to it. Under the Cæsars there was no insurrection, but there was a Juvenal. The arousing of indignation replaces the Gracchi. Under the Cæsars there is the exile of Syene; there is also the author of the Annals. As the Neros reign darkl y they should be pictured so. Work with the graver onl y would be pale; into the grooves should be poured a concentrated prose that bites. Despots are an aid to thinkers. Speech enchained is speech terrible. The writer doubles and triples his style, when silence is imposed by a master upon the people. There springs from this silence a certain mysterious fullness, which filters and freezes into brass fn the thoughts. Compression in the history produces conciseness in the historian. The granitic solidity of some celebrated prose is onl y a condensation produced by the Tyrant. Tyranny constrains the writer to shortenings of diame ter which are in-creases of strength. The Ciceronian period, hardl y sufficient upon Verres, would lose its edge upon Caligula. The Demagogue is the predecessor of the Despot. One springs from the other's loins. He who will basely fawn on those who have office to bestow, will betra y like Iscariot, and prove a miser- able and pitiab le failure. Let the new Junius lash s uch men as they deserve, and History make them immortal in infamy; since their influences culminate in ruin. The Republic that employs and honors the shallow, the superficial, the base, \"  who crouch Unto the offal of an office promised,\" at last weeps tears of blood for its fatal error. Of s uch supreme folly, the sure fruit is damnation. Let the nobilit y of every great heart, condensed into justice and truth, strike such creatures like a thunderbolt! If you can do no more, you can at least condemn by your vote, and ostracise by denunciation.

The habit of electione ering and begging for office culminates in briber y with office, and corruption in office. A chosen man has a visible trust from God, as plainl y as if the com mission were engrossed by the notary. A nation cannot renounce the executorship of the Divine decrees. As little can Masonry. It must labor to do its dut y knowingly and wisely . We must remember that, in free States, as well as in despotis ms, Injustice, the spouse of Oppres sion, is the fruitful parent of Deceit, Distrust, Hatred, Conspiracy, Treason, and Unfaithfulness. Even in assailing Tyranny we must have Truth and Reason as our chief weapons. We must march into that fight like the old Puritans, or into the battle with the abuses that spring up in free governm ent, with the flaming sword in one hand, and the Oracles of God in the other. The citizen who cannot accomplish well the smaller purpose s of public life, cannot compass the larger. The vast power of endurance, forbearance, patience, and performanc e, of a free people, is acquired only by continual exercise of all the functions, like the healthful physical human vigor. If the individual citizens have it not, the State must equally be without it. It is of the essence of a free governmen t, that the people should not only be concerned in making the laws, but also in their execution. No man ought to be mor e ready to obey and adm inister the law than he who has helped to make it. The business of governm ent is carried on for the benefit of all, and ever y co-partner should give counsel and co-operation. Remember also, as another shoal on which States are wrecked, that free States always tend toward the depositing of the citizens in strata, the creation of castes, the perpetuation of the jus divinum to office in families. The more democr atic the State, the more sure this result. For, as free States advance in power, there is a strong tendenc y toward centraliza tion, not from deliberate evil intention, but from the course of events and the indolence of human nature.

Only give the m the power to get rid, when caprice prompts them, of the great and wi se men, and elect the little, and as to all the rest the y will relapse into indolence and indifferenc e. The central power, creation of the people, organized and cunning if not enlightened, is the perpetual tribunal set up by them for the redress of w rong and the rule of justice. It soon supplies itself with all the requisite machinery, and is ready and apt for all kinds of interferenc e. The people may be a child all its life. The central power may not be able to suggest the best scientific solution of a problem; but it has the easiest means of carr ying an idea into effect. If the purpose to be attained is a large one, it requires a large comprehension ; it is proper for the action of the central power. If it be a small one, it may be thwarted by disagree ment. The central power must step in as an arbitrator and prevent this. The people may be too averse to change, too slothful in their own busines s, unjust to a minority or a majorit y. The central power must take the reins when the people drop the m. France became centrali zed in its governmen t more by the apath y and ignorance of its people than by the tyranny of its kings. When the inmost parish-life is given up to the direct guardianship of the State, and the repair of the belfry of a country church requires a written order from the central power, a people is in its dotage. Men are thus nurtured in imbecility, from the dawn of s ocial life. When the central governmen t feeds part of the people it prepares all to be slaves. When it directs parish and count y affairs, the y are slaves already. The next step is to regulate labor and its wages. Nevertheless, whatever follies the free people may commit, even to the putting of the powers of legislation in the hands of the littl e compe tent and less honest, despair not of the final result. The terrible teacher, EXPERIENCE, writing his lessons on hearts desolated with calamity and wrung by agony, will make them wiser in time. Pretence and grim ace and sordid beggary for votes will some day cease to avail. Have F AITH, and struggle on, against all evil influences and discourage ments!

When Christianit y had grown weak, profitless, and powerless, the Arab Restorer and Iconoclast came, like a cleansing hurricane. When the battle of Damascus was about to be fought, the Christian bishop, at the early dawn, in his robes, at the head of his clerg y, with the Cross once so triumphan t raised in the air, came down to the gates of the city, and laid open before the army the Testam ent of Christ. The Christian general, THOM AS, laid his hand on the book, and said, \" Oh God! IF our faith be true, aid us, and deliver us not into the hand s of its enemies! \" But KHALED, \" the Sword of God ,\" who had mar ched from victory to victory , exclaimed to his wearied soldiers, \" Let no man sleep! There will be rest enough in the bowers of Paradise; sweet will be the repose never more to be followed by labor .\" The faith of the Arab had become stronger than that of the Christian, and he conquered. The Sword is also, in the Bible, an emblem of SPEECH, or of the utterance of thought. Thus, in that vision or apocal ypse of the subli me exile of Patmos, a protest in the name of the ideal, overwhelm ing the real world, a tremendous satire uttered in the name of Religion and Liberty, and with its fiery reverberations smiting the throne of the Cæsars, a sharp two- edged sword comes out of the mouth of the Semblanc e of the Son of M an, encircl ed by the seven golden candlesticks, and holding in his right hand seven stars. \"The Lord,\" says Isaiah, \"hath mad e my mouth like a sharp sword.\" \"I have slain them,\" says Hosea, \"b y the words of m y mouth.\" \"The word of God,\" s ays the writer of the apostolic letter to the Hebrews, \"is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit.\" \"The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,\" say s Paul, writing to the Christians at Ephesus. \"I will fight against them with the sword of m y mouth,\" it is said in the Apocal ypse, to the angel of the church at Pergamos. * * * * * * The spoken discourse ma y roll on strongl y as the great tidal wave; but, like the wave, it dies at last feebly on the sands. It is heard by few, remembered by still fewer, and fades away, like an echo in the mounta ins, leaving no token of power. It is nothing to the living and coming generations of men. It was the written human speech, that gave power and permanence to human thought. It is this that makes the whole human history but one individual life. To write on the rock is to write on a solid parchment ; but it requires a pilgri mage to see it. There is but one copy, and Time wears even that. To write on skins or pap yrus was to give, as it were, but one tardy edition, and the rich only could procure it. The Chinese stereotyped not only the unchanging wisdom of old sages, but also the passing events. The process tended to suffocate thought, and to hinder progres s; for there is continual wandering in the wisest minds, and Truth writes her last words, not on clean tablets, but on the scrawl that Error has mad e and often mended. Printing made the mov able letters prolific. Thenceforth the orator spoke almost visibly to listening nations; and the author wrote, like the Pope, his œcumenic decrees, urbi et orbi , and ordered them to be posted up in all the market- places; remaining, if he chose, impervious to human sight. The doom of tyrannies was thenceforth sealed. Satire and invectiv e became potent as armies. The unseen hands of the Juniuses could launch the thunderbolts, and make the ministers tremble. One whisper from this giant fills the earth as easily as Demosthenes filled the Agora. It will soon be heard at the antipodes as easily as Page 42 of 621"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike in the next street. It travels with the lightning under the oceans. It makes the mass one man, speaks to it in the same common language, and elicits a sure and single response. Speech passes into thought, and thence promptly into act. A nation becomes truly one, with one large heart and a single throbbing pulse. Men are invisibl y present to each other, as if already spiritual beings; and the thinker who sits in an Alpine solitude, unknown to or forgotten by all the world, among the silent herds and hills, may flash his words to all the cities and over all the seas. Select the thinkers to be Legislators; and avoid the gabblers. Wisdom is rarel y loquacious. Weight and depth of thought are unfavorable to volubilit y. The shallow and superficia l are generall y voluble and often pass for eloquent. More word s, less thought, – is the general rule. The man who endeavors to sa y someth ing worth rem embering in ever y sentence, becomes fastidious, and condenses like Tacitus. The vulgar love a more diffuse stream. The ornamen tation that does not cover strength is the gewgaw s of babble. Neither is dialect ic subtlet y valuable to public men. The Christian faith has it, had it formerly more than now; a subtlety that might have entangled Plato, and which has rivalled in a fruitless fashion the mystic lore of Jewish Rabbis and Indian Sages. It is not this which converts the heathen. It is a vain task to balance the great thoughts of the earth, like hollow straws, on the finger- tips of disputation. It is not this kind of warfare which makes the Cross triumphan t in the hearts of the unbelievers; but the actual power that lives in the Faith. So there is a politica l scholasticis m that is merel y useless. The dexterit ies of subtle logic rarely stir the hearts of the people, or convince them. The true apostle of Libert y, Fraternit y and Equalit y makes it a matter of life and death. His combats are like those of Bossuet, – combats to the death. The true apostolic fire is like the lightning: it flashes conviction into the soul. The true word is veril y a two-edged sword. Matters of governm ent and political science can be fairl y dealt with onl y by sound reason, and the logic of com mon sense: not the common sense of the ignorant, but of the wise. The acutest thinkers rarel y succeed in be-coming leaders of men. A watchword or a catchword is more potent with the people than logic, especiall y if this be the least metaph ysical. When a political prophet arises, to stir the drea ming, stagnant nation, and hold back its feet from the irretriev able descent, to heave the land as with an earthquake, and shake the silly-shallow idols from their seats, his words will com e straight from God's own mouth, and be thundered into the conscience. He will reason, teach, warn, and rule. The real \"Sword of the Spirit\" is keener than the brightest blade of Damascus. Such men rule a land, in the strength of justice, with wisdom and with power. Still, the men of dialect ic subtlet y often rule well, because in practice they forget their finely-spun theories, and use the trenchant logic of com mon sense. But when the great heart and large intellec t are left to the rust in private life, and small attorne ys, brawlers in politics, and those who in the cities would be only the clerks of notaries, or practitioners in the disreputable courts, are made national Legislators, the countr y is in her dotage, even if the beard has not y et grown upon her chin. In a free countr y, human speech must needs be free; and the State must listen to the maunderings of folly, and the screechings of its geese, and the brayings of its asses, as well as to the golden oracles of its wise and great men. Even the despotic old kings allowed their wise fools to sa y what they liked. The true alche mist will extract the lessons of wisdom from the babblings of folly . He will hear what a man has to say on any given Page 43 of 621"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike subject, even if the speaker end onl y in proving himse lf prince of fools. Even a fool will sometimes hit the mark. There is some truth in all men who are not comp elled to suppress their souls and speak other men's thoughts. The finger even of the idiot may point to the great highwa y. A people, as well as the sages, must learn to forget. If it neither learns the new nor forgets the old, it is fated, even if it has been royal for thirt y generations. To unlearn is to learn; and also it is some times needful to learn again the forgotten. The antics of fools mak e the current follies more palpable, as fashions are shown to be absurd b y caricatur es, which so lead to their extirpat ion. The buffoon and the zany are useful in their places. The ingenious artificer and crafts man, like Solomon, searches the earth for his m aterials, and transfor ms the misshapen matter into glorious workmanship. The world is conquered b y the head even more than by the hands. Nor will an y assembly talk forever. After a time, when it has listened long enough, it quietly puts the silly, the shallow, and the superficial to one side, – it thinks, and sets to work. The human thought, especiall y in popular assemblies, runs in the most singularl y crooked channels, harder to trace and follow than the blind currents of the ocean. No notion is so absurd that it may not find a place there. The master- workman must train these notions and vagaries with his two-handed hammer. They twist out of the way of the sword-thrusts; and are invulnerable all over, even in the heel, against logic. The mar tel or mace, the battle- axe, the great double-edged two-handed sword must deal with follies; the rapier is no better against them than a wand, unless it be the rapier of ridicule. The SWOR D is also the symbol of war and of the soldier . Wars, like thunder- storms, are often necessary to purify the stagnant atmosphere. War is not a de mon, without remorse or reward. It restores the brotherhood in letters of fire. When men are seated in their pleasant places, sunken in ease and indolence, with Pretence and Incapacit y and Littlen ess usurping all the high places of State, war is the baptis m of blood and fire, b y which alone the y can be renovated. It is the hurricane that brings the ele mental equilibr ium, the concord of Power and Wisdom. So long as these continue obstinatel y divorced, it will continue to chasten. In the mutual appeal of nations to God, there is the acknowledg ment of His might. It lights the beacons of Faith and Freedom, and heats the furnace through which the earnest and loyal pass to im mortal glory. There is in war the doom of defeat, the quenchless sense of Duty, the stirring sense of Honor, the measureless solemn sacrifice of devotedness, and the incense of success. Even in the flame and smoke of battle, the Mason discovers his brother, and fulfills the sacred obligations of Fraternit y. Two, or the Duad, is the s ymbol of Antagonis m; of Good and Evil, Light and Darknes s. It is Cain and Abel, Eve and Lilith, Jachin and Boaz, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Osiris and Typhon. THREE, or the Triad, is most significantl y expressed by the equilat eral and the right- angled triangles. There are three principal colors or ra ys in the rainbow, which b y intermixture make seven . The three are the blue , the yellow , and the red . The Trinity of the Deity, in one mod e or other, has been an articl e in all creeds. He creates, preserves, and destroys. He is the generative power , the productive capacity , and the result . The immaterial man, according to the Kabalah, is composed of vitality , or life , the breath of Page 44 of 621"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike life; of soul or mind , and spirit . Salt, sulphur, and mercur y are the great s ymbols of the alchemists. To them man was body, soul, and spirit. FOUR is expressed b y the square, or four-sided right- angled figure. Out of the s ymbolic Garden of Eden flowed a river, dividing into four streams, – PISON, which flows around the land of gold, or light; GIHON, w hich flows around the land of Ethiopia or Darknes s; HIDDEKEL, running eastward to Assyria; and the EUPHRATES. Zechariah saw four chariots coming out from between two moun tains of bronze, in the first of which were red horses; in the second, black ; in the third, white ; and in the fourth, grizzled : \"and these were the four winds of the heavens, that go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.\" Ezekiel saw the four living creatures, each with four faces and four wings, the faces of a man and a lion , an ox and an eagle ; and the four wheels going upon their four sides; and Saint John beheld the four beasts, full of eyes before and behind, the LION, the y oung Ox, the MAN, and the flying EAGLE. Four was the signature of the Earth. Therefore, in the 148th Psalm, of those who must praise the Lord on the land, there are four times four , and four in particular of living creatures. Visible nature is described as the four quarters of the world, and the four corners of the earth. \"There are four ,\" says the old Jewish sa ying, \"which take the first place in this world: man , among the creatures; the eagle among birds; the ox among cattle; and the lion among wild beasts.\" Daniel saw four great beasts come up from the sea. FIVE is the Duad added to the Triad. It is expressed b y the five-pointed or blazing star, the mysterious Pentalpha of Pythagoras. It is indissolubly connected with the number seven . Christ fed His disciples and the mul titude with five loaves and two fishes, and of the fragments there remained twelve , that is, five and seven , baskets full. Again He fed them with seven loaves and a few littl e fishes, and there remained seven baskets full. The five apparentl y small planets, Mercur y, Venus, Mars, J upiter, and Saturn, with the two greater ones, the Sun and M oon, constituted the seven celestia l spheres. SEVEN was the peculiarl y sacred number. There were seven planets and spheres presided over by seven archangels. There were seven colors in the rainbow; and the Phœnician Deity was called the HEPTAKIS or G od of seven rays; seven days of the week; and seven and five made the number of months, tribes, and apostles. Zechari ah saw a golden candlestick, with seven lamps and seven pipes to the la mps, and an olive-tree on each side. Since he says, \"the seven eyes of the Lord shall rejoice, and shall see the plu mmet in the hand of Zerubbabel.\" John, in the Apocalypse, writes seven epistles to the seven churches. In the seven epistles there are twelve promises. What is said of the churches in praise or blame, is completed in the number three . The refrain, \" who ha s ears to hear ,\" etc., has ten words, divided by three and seven , and the seven by three and four ; and the seven epistles are also so divided. In the seals, tru mpets, and vials, also, of this symbolic vision, the seven are divided by four and three . He who sends his message to Ephesus, \"holds the seven stars in his right hand, and walks amid the seven golden la mps.\" In six days, or periods, God created the Universe, and paused on the seventh day. Of clean beasts, Noah was directed to take by sevens into the ark; and of fowls by sevens ; because in seven days the rain was to commence. On the seven teenth day of the month, the rain began; on the seven teenth day of the seventh month, the ark rested on Ararat. When the dove returned, Noah waited seven days before he sent her forth again; and again seven , after she Page 45 of 621"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike returned with the olive-leaf. Enoch was the seventh patriarch, Adam included, and Lam ech lived 777 years. There were seven lamps in the great candlestick of the Tabernac le and Temple, representing the seven planets. Seven times Moses sprinkled the anointing oil upon the altar. The days of consecration of Aaron and his sons were seven in number. A woman was unclean seven days after child-birth; one infected with lepros y was shut up seven days; seven times the leper was sprinkled with the blood of a slain bird; and seven days afterwards he must remain abroad out of his tent. Seven times, in purifying the leper, the priest was to sprinkle the consecrated oil; and seven times to sprinkle with the blood of the sacrificed bird the house to be purified. Seven times the blood of the slain bullock was sprinkled on the m ercy-seat; and seven times on the altar. The seventh year was a Sabbath of rest; and at the end of seven times seven years came the great y ear of jubilee. Seven days the people ate unleavened bread, in the month of Abib. Seven weeks were counted from the time of first putting the sickle to the wheat. The Feast of the Tabernacl es lasted seven days. Israel was in the hand of Midian seven years before Gideon delivered them. The bullock sacrificed by him was seven years old. Samson told Delilah to bind him with seven green withes; and she wove the seven locks of his head, and afterwards shaved them off. Balaam told Barak to build for hi m seven altars. Jacob served seven years for Leah and seven for Rachel. Job had seven sons and three daughters, mak ing the perfect number ten . He had also seven thousand sheep and three thousand cam els. His friends sat down with him seven days and seven nights. His friends were ordered to sacrifice seven bullocks and seven rams; and again, at the end, he had seven sons and three daughters, and twice seven thousand sheep, and lived an hundred and fort y, or twice seven times ten years. Pharaoh saw in his dream seven fat and seven lean kine, seven good ears and seven blasted ears of wheat; and there were seven years of plent y, and seven of famine. Jericho fell, when seven priests, with seven trumpets, made the circuit of the city on seven successive days; once each day for six da ys, and seven times on the seventh . \"The seven eyes of the Lord,\" sa ys Zechariah, \"run to and fro through the whole earth.\" Solomon was seven years in building the Temple. Seven angels, in the Apocalypse, pour out seven plagues, from seven vials of wrath. The scarlet- colored beast, on which the woman sits in the wilderness, has seven heads and ten horns. So also has the beast that rises up out of the sea. Seven thunders uttered their voices. Seven angels sounded seven trumpets. Seven lamps of fire, the seven spirits of God, burned before the throne; and the Lamb that was slain had seven horns and seven eyes. EIGHT is the first cube, that of two . NINE is the square of three , and represented by the triple triangle. TEN includes all the other numbers. It is especiall y seven and three ; and is called the number of perfection. Pythagoras represented it by the TETRACTYS, which had many mystic meanings. This symbol is sometimes composed of dots or points, sometimes of commas or yōds, and in the Kabalah, of the letters of the name of Deity .

III — THE MASTER. * * * * * * To understand literal ly the symbols and allegories of Oriental books as to ante-historical matters, is willfull y to close our eyes against the Light. To translate the symbols into the trivial and com monplace, is the blundering of mediocr ity. All religious expression is s ymbolism; since we can describe only what we see , and the true objects of religion are THE SEEN. The earliest instrumen ts of education were symbols; and they and all other religious forms differed and still differ according to external circumst ances and imager y, and according to differences of knowledge and men tal cultivation. All language is symbolic, so far as it is applied to mental and spiritual phenom ena and action. All words have, prim arily, a material sense, however they may afterward get, for the ignorant, a spiritual non -sense. \"To retract,\" for exa mple, is to draw back , and when applied to a statement , is symbolic, as much so as a picture of an ar m drawn back, to express the same thing, would be. The ver y word \" spirit \" means \" breath ,\" from the Latin verb spiro , breathe. To present a visible symbol to the eye of another is not necessaril y to inform him of the meaning which that symbol has to y ou. Hence the philosopher soon superadded to the symbols explanat ions addressed to the ear, susceptible of more precision, but less effective and impressive than the painted or sculptured forms which he endeavored to explain. Out of these explanations grew b y degrees a variet y of narrations, whose true object and meaning were graduall y forgotten, or lost in contradic tions and incongruiti es. And w hen these were abandoned, and Philosophy resorted to definitions and formu las, its language was but a mor e complicated symbolism, attempting in the dark to grapple with and picture ideas impossible to be expressed. For as with the visible symbol, so with the word: to utter it to you does not inform you of the exact meaning which it has to me ; and thus religion and philosophy became to a great extent disputes as to the meaning of word s. The most abstract expression for DEITY, w hich language can suppl y, is but a sign or symbol for an object be yond our comprehension, and not more truthful and adequate than the images of OSIRIS and VISHNU, or their names, except as being less sensuou s and explicit. We avoid sensuousness only by resorting to simple negation. We come at last to define spirit by saying that it is not m atter. Spirit is – spirit. A single example of the symbolism of words will indicat e to you one branch of Masonic study. We find in the English Rite this phrase: \"I will always hail , ever conceal, and never reveal;\" and in the Catechism , these: Q \" ∴ I hail .\" A \" ∴ I conceal ;\" and ignorance, misunderstanding the word \" hail ,\" has interpolated the phrase, \"From whence do you hail !'\" But the word is reall y \" hele ,\" from the Anglo-Saxon verb elan, helan , to cover , hide , or conceal . And this word is rendered by the Latin verb tegere , to cover or roof over . \"That ye Page 48 of 621"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike fro me no thynge woll hele,\" says Gower. \"They hele fro me no priuy te,\" says the Romaunt of the Rose. \"To heal a house,\" is a com mon phrase in Sussex; and in the west of England, he that covers a house with slates is called a Healer . Wherefore, to \" heal \" means the same thing as to \" tile ,\" – itself symbolic, as meaning, primari ly, to cover a house with tiles , – and means to cover , hide , or conceal . Thus language too is symbolism, and words are as much misunderstood and misused as more material symbols are. Symbolism tended continuall y to becom e more compli cated; and all the powers of Heaven were reproduced on earth, until a web of fiction and allegor y was woven, partl y by art and partly by the ignorance of error, which the wit of man, with his li mited means of explanat ion, will never unravel. Even the Hebrew Theism became involved in symbolism and image- worship, borrowed probabl y from an older creed and remot e regions of Asia, – the worship of the Great Semitic Nature- God AL or ELS and its s ymbolical representations of JEHO VAH Himself were not even confined to poetica l or illustrat ive language. The priests were monotheists: the people idolaters. There are dangers inseparable from symbolism, which afford an impressive lesson in regard to the similar risks attendant on the use of language. The imagin ation, called in to assist the reason, usurp s its place or leaves its ally helplessl y entangled in its web. N ames which stand for things are confounded with the m; the me ans are mist aken for the end; the instrum ent of interpretation for the object; and thus s ymbols come to usurp an independent character as truths and persons. Though perhaps a necessary path, they were a dangerous one by which to approach the Deit y; in which many, says PLUTARCH, \"mistaking the sign for the thing signified, fell into a ridiculous superstition; while others, in avoiding one extreme, plunged into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impi ety.\" It is through the Mysteries, CICERO say s, that we have learned the first principles of life; wherefore the term \"initiation\" is used with good reason; and the y not onl y teach us to live more happily and agreeabl y, but they soften the pains of death by the hope of a better life hereafter. The Mysteries were a Sacred Drama, exhibit ing some legend significant of nature's changes, of the visible Universe in which the Divinit y is revealed, and who se import was in many respects as open to the Pagan as to the Christian. Nature is the great Teacher of man; for it is the Revelat ion of God. It neither dogma tizes nor attem pts to tyrannize by compelling to a particular creed or special interpret ation. It presents its symbols to us, and adds nothing by way of explanation. It is the text without the commentary; and, as we well know, it is chiefl y the com mentary and gloss that lead to error and heresy and persecution. The earliest instructors of mankind not onl y adopted the lessons of Nature, but as far as possible adhered to her method of impar ting them. In the Mysteries, beyond the current traditions or sacred and enig matic recitals of the Te mples, few explanat ions were given to the spectators, who were left, as in the school of nature, to make inferences for the mselves. No other method could have suited every degree of cultiva tion and capacit y. To employ nature's universal symbolism instead of the technica lities of language, rewards the humblest inquirer, and discloses its secrets to every one in proportion to his preparator y training and his po wer to compreh end them. If their philosophical meaning was above the comprehension of some, their moral and political meanings are within the reach of all.

The alteration from symbol to dogma is fatal to beaut y of expression, and leads to intolerance and assumed infallibil ity. * * * * * * If, in teaching the great doctrine of the divine nature. of the Soul, and in striving to explain its longings after immortality, and in proving its superiorit y over the souls of the animals, which have no aspirations Heavenward, the ancients struggled in vain to express the nature of the soul, by compar ing it to FIRE and LIGHT, it will be well for us to consider whether, with all our boa sted knowledge, we have any better or clearer idea of its nature, and whether we have not despairingl y taken refuge in having none at all. And if they erred as to its original place of abode, and understood literal ly the mode and path of its descent, these were but the accessories of the great Truth, and probabl y, to the Initiates, mere allegories, designed to make the idea more palpable and impressive to the mind. They are at least no more fit to be smiled at by the self-conceit of a vain ignorance, the wealth of who se knowledge consists solel y in word s, than the bosom of Abraham, as a home for the spirits of the just dead; the gulf of actual fire, for the eternal torture of spirits ; and the Cit y of the New Jerusalem, with its walls of jasper and its edifices of pure gold like clear glass, its foundations of precious stones, and its gates each of a single pearl. \"I knew a man,\" says PAUL, \"caught up to the third Heaven;... that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard ineffable words, w hich it is not pos sible for a man to utter.\" And nowhere is the antagonis m and conflict between the spirit and bod y more frequentl y and forcibl y insisted on than in the writings of this apostle, nowhere the Divine nature of the soul more strongly asserted. \"With the mind,\" he says, \"I serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin...

At length, office and honor are divorced. The place that the small and shallow, the knave or the trickster, is deem ed compe tent and fit to fill, ceases to be worthy the ambition of the great and capable ; or if not, these shrink from a contest, the weapons to be used wherein are unfit for a gentlem an to handle. Then the habits of unprincipled advocates in law courts are naturalized in Senates, and pettifoggers wrangle there, when the fate of the nation and the lives of m illions are at stake. States are even begotten by villainy and brought forth by fraud, and rascalities are justified by legislators claiming to be honorable. Then contested elections are decided by perjured votes or part y considerations; and all the practices of the worst tim es of corruption are revived and exaggerated in Republics. It is strange that reverence for truth, that manliness and genuine loyalty, and scorn of littleness and unfair advantage, and genuine faith and godliness and large-heartedness should dim inish, among statesmen and people, as civiliz ation advances, and freedom becomes more general, and universal suffrage implies universal worth and fitness! In the age of Elizabeth, without universal suffrage, or Societies for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, or popular lecturers, or Lycæa, the statesman, the mer chant, the burgher, the sailor, were all alike heroic, fearing God only, and man not at all. Let but a hundred or two years elapse, and in a Monarchy or Republic of the same race, nothing is less heroic than the merchan t, the shrewd speculator, the office- seeker, fearing man only, and God not at all. Reverence for greatness dies out, and is succeeded by base envy of greatness. Ever y man is in the way of man y, either in the path to popularit y or wealth. There is a general feeling of satisfaction when a great statesman is displaced, or a general, who has been for his brief hour the popular idol, is unfortunate and sinks from his high estate. It becomes a misfortun e, if not a cri me, to be above the popular level. We should naturall y suppose that a nation in distress would take counsel with the wisest of its sons. But, on the contrar y, great men seem never so scarce as when the y are most needed, and smal l men never so bold to insist on infesting place, as when mediocr ity and incapable pretence and sophomori c greenness, and showy and sprightl y incompe tency are most dangerous. When France was in the extre mity of revolutionar y agony, she wa s governed by an assembl y of provincial pettifoggers, and Robespierre, Marat, and Couthon ruled in the place of Mirabeau, Vergniaud, and Carnot.

Cromwell extinguished one bod y, and Napoleon the other. Fraud, falsehood, trickery, and deceit in national affairs are the signs of decadence in States and precede convulsions or paral ysis. To bull y the weak and crouch to the strong, is the policy of nations governed by small mediocr ity. The tricks of the canvass for office are re-enacted in Senates. The Executiv e becom es the dispenser of patronage, chiefly to the most unworthy; and men are bribed with offices instead of mone y, to the greater ruin of the Commonwe alth. The Divine in human nature disappears, and interest, greed, and selfishness takes it place. That is a sad and true allegor y which represents the companions of Ulysses changed b y the enchantm ents of Circe into swine. * * * * * * \"Ye cannot,\" said the Great Teacher, \"serve God and Mamm on.\" When the thirst for wealth becom es general, it will be sought for as well dishonestl y as hone stly; by frauds and overreachings, by the knaveries of trade, the heartlessness of greed y speculation, by gambling in stocks and com modities that soon demoralizes a whole community. Men will speculate upon the needs of their neighbors and the distresses of their country. Bubbles that, bursting, impoverish multitudes, will be blown up by cunning knavery , with stupid credulit y as its assistants and instru ment. Huge bankruptcies, that startle a countr y like the earth-quakes, and are more fatal, fraudulent assignments, engulfment of the savings of the poor, expansions and collapses of the currenc y, the crash of bank s, the depreciat ion of Governmen t securities, prey on the savings of self-denial, and trouble with their depredations the first nourishmen t of infanc y and the last sands of life, and fill with inmates the church yards and lunatic asylums. But the sharper and speculator thrives and fattens. If his countr y is fighting by a levy en masse for her ver y existence, he aids her by depreciat ing her paper, so that he may accumulate fabulous amounts with little outlay. If his neighbor is distressed, he bu ys his propert y for a song. If he administ ers upon an estate, it turns out insolvent, and the orphans are paupers. If his bank explodes, he is found to have taken care of hi mself in time. Society worships its paper- and-credit kings, as the old Hindus and Eg yptians worshipped their worthless idols, and often the most obsequiously when in actual solid wealth they are the veriest paupers. N o wonder men think there ought to be another world, in which the injustices of this ma y be atoned for, when the y see the friends of ruined fam ilies begging the wealth y sharpers to give al ms to prevent the orphaned victims from starving, until they may find wa ys of supporting the mselves. * * * * * * States are chiefl y avaricious of comm erce and of territor y. The latter leads to the violation of treati es, encroachm ents upon feeble neighbors, and rapacit y toward their wards who se lands are coveted. Republics are, in this, as rapacious and unprincipled as Despots, never learning from history that inordinate expansion b y rapine and fraud has its inevitable consequences in disme mberment or subjugation. When a Republic begins to plunder its neighbors, the word s of doom are alread y written on its walls. There is a judgmen t already pronounced of God upon whatever is unrighteous in the conduct of national affairs. When civil war tears the vitals of a Republic, let it look back and see if it has not been guilt y of injustices; and if it has, let it humble itself in the dust! Page 52 of 621"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike When a nation becom es possessed with a spirit of com mercial greed, beyond those ju st and fair limits set by a due regard to a modera te and reasonable degree of general and individual prosperity , it is a nation possessed by the devil of com mercial avarice, a passion as ignoble and demor alizing as avarice in the individual; and as this sordid passion is baser and more unscrupulous than ambition, so it is more hateful, and at last makes the infected nation to be regarded as the enemy of the hum an race. To grasp at the lion's share of commerce, has alway s at last proven the ruin of States, because it invariabl y leads to injustices that make a State detestabl e; to a selfishness and crooked policy that forbid other nations to be the friends of a State that cares only for itself. Commercial avarice in India was the parent of more atrocities and greater rapacit y, and cost more human lives, than the nobler ambition for extended empire of Consular Rome. The nation that grasps at the commerce of the world cannot but become selfish, calculating, dead to the noblest impulses and sympathies which ought to actuate States. It will submit to insults that wound its honor, rather than endanger its commercial interests by war; while, to subserve those interests, it will wage un just war, on false or frivolous pretexts, its free people cheerfull y allying themselves with despots to crush a com mercial rival that has dared to exile its kings and elect its own ruler. Thus the cold calcul ations of a sordid self-interest, in nations commercially avaricious, always at last displace the senti ments and lofty impulses of Honor and Generosity by which they rose to greatness; which mad e Elizabe th and Cromwell alike the protectors of Protestants beyond the four seas of England, against crowned T yranny and mi tred Persecution; and, if they had lasted, would have forbidden alliances with Czars and Autocrats and Bourbons to re-enthrone the Tyrannies of Incapacit y, and arm the Inquisition anew with its instrum ents of torture. The soul of the avaricious nation petrifies, like the soul of the individual who makes gold his god. The Despot will occasionall y act upon noble and generous impu lses, and help the weak against the strong, the right against the wrong. But comm ercial avarice is essentiall y egotistic, grasping, faithless, overreaching, crafty, cold, ungenerous, selfish, and calculat ing, controlled by considerations of self- interest alone. Heartless and mer ciless, it has no sentim ents of pity, sympathy, or honor, to mak e it pause in its remorseless career; and it crushes down all that is of imp ediment in its way, as its keels of comm erce crush under them the mur muring and unheeded waves. A war for a great principle ennobles a nation. A war for comm ercial supremac y, upon some shallow pretext, is despicable, and more than aught else demonstrat es to what immeasurable depths of baseness men and nations can descend. Comm ercial greed values the lives of m en no more than it values the lives of ants. The slave- trade is as acceptable to a people enthrall ed by that greed, as the trade in ivor y or spices, if the profits are as large. It will by-and-by endeavor to compound with God and quiet its own conscience, by compelling those to whom it sold the slaves it bought or stole, to set the m free, and slaughtering them by hecatombs if they refuse to obey the edicts of its philanthrop y. Justice in no wise consists in me ting out to another that exact measure of reward or punishmen t which we think and decree his mer it, or what we call his crim e, which is more often merely his error, deserves. The justice of the father is not incomp atible with forgiveness b y him of the errors and offences of his child. The Infinite Justice of God does not consist in me ting out exact measures of punishmen t for human frailties and sins. We Page 53 of 621"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike are too apt to erect our own little and narrow notions of what is right and just into the law of justice, and to insist that God shall adopt that as His law; to measure off someth ing with our own little tape-line, and call it God's love of ju stice. Continuall y we seek to ennoble our own ignoble love of revenge and retali ation, by misnaming it justice. Nor does j ustice consist in strictly governing our conduct toward other men by the rigid rules of legal right. If there were a community anywhere, in which all stood upon the strictness of this rule, there should be written over its gates, as a warning to the unfortunates desiring admission to that inhospitable realm, the words which DA NTE says are written over the great gate of Hell: \"LET THOSE WH O ENTER HERE LEAVE HOPE BEHIND!\" It is not just to pa y the laborer in field or factor y or work shop his current wages and no more, the lowest market- value of his labor, for so long onl y as we need that labor and he is able to work; for when sickness or old age overtakes him, that is to leave him and his famil y to starve; and God will curse with cala mity the people in which the children of the laborer out of work eat the boiled grass of the field, and moth ers strangle their children, that they may buy food for the mselves with the charitab le pittanc e given for burial expenses. The rules of what is ordinaril y termed \" Justice ,\" may be punctiliousl y observed among the fallen spirits that are the aristocrac y of Hell. * * * * * * Justice, divorced from sympathy, is selfish indifference, not in the least more laudable than misanthropic isolation. There is sympathy even among the hair- like oscillatorias, a tribe of simple plants, armies of which may be discovered, with the aid of the microscope, in the tiniest bit of scum from a stagnant pool. For these will place themselves, as if it were b y agreement, in separate companies, on the side of a vessel containing them, and seem marching upward in rows; and when a swarm grows weary of its situation, and has a mind to change its quarters, each army holds on its way without confusion or interm ixture, proceeding with great regularit y and order, as if under the directions of wise leaders. The ants and bees give each other mutual assistance, beyond what is required by that which human creatures are apt to regard as the strict law of ju stice. Surely we need but reflect a little, to be convinced that the individual man is but a fraction of the unit of society, and that he is indissolubly connected with the rest of his race. Not only the actions, but the will and thoughts of other men make or mar his fortunes, control his destinies, are unto him life or death, dishonor or honor. The epidem ics, physical and moral, contagious and infectious, public opinion, popular delusions, enthusiasms, and the other great electric phenomena and currents, moral and intellec tual, prove the universal sympathy. The vote of a single and obscure man, the utteranc e of self-will, ignorance, conceit, or spite, deciding an election and placing Folly or Incapacit y or Baseness in a Senate, involves the countr y in war, sweeps away our fortunes, slaughters our sons, renders the labors of a life unavailing, and pushes on, helpless, with all our intell ect to resist, into the grave. These considerations ought to teach us that justice to others and to ourselves is the same ; that we cannot define our duties b y mathematical lines ruled by the square, but must fill with them the great circle traced by the compasses; that the circle of human ity is the li mit, and we are but the point in its centre, the drops in the great Atlantic, the ato m or particl e, bound b y a mysterious law of attrac tion which we term sympathy to ever y other atom in Page 54 of 621"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the mass; that the physical and moral welfare of others cannot be indifferent to us; that we have a direct and immediate interest in the public morality and popular intell igence, in the well-being and physical comfort of the people at large. The ignorance of the people, their pauperis m and destitution, and consequent degradation, their brutaliz ation and demoralization, are all diseases; and we cannot rise high enough above the people, nor shut ourselves up from them enough, to escape the miasm atic contagion and the great m agnetic currents. Justice is peculiarl y indispensable to nations. The unj ust State is doomed of God to calamity and ruin. This is the teaching of the Eternal Wisdom and of histor y. \"Righteousness exalte th a nation; but wrong is a reproach to nations.\" \"The Throne is established by Righteousness. Let the lips of the Ruler pronounce the sentence that is Divine; and his mou th do no wrong in ju dgment!\" The nation that adds province to province by fraud and violence, that encroaches on the weak and plunders its wards, and violates its treaties and the obligation of its contracts, and for the law of honor and fair- dealing substitutes the exigencies of greed and the base precepts of polic y and craft and the ignoble tenets of expedienc y, is predestined to destruction; for here, as with the individual, the consequences of wrong are inevitable and eternal. A sentence is written against all that is unjust, written by God in the nature of man and in the nature of the Universe, because it is in the nature of the Infinite God. No w rong is really successful. The gain of injustice is a loss; its pleasure, suffering. Iniquit y often seems to prosper, but its success is its defeat and shame. If its consequences pass by the doer, they fall upon and crush his children. It is a philosophical, physical, and moral truth, in the form of a threat, that God visits the iniquit y of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of those who violate His laws. After a long while, the day of reckoning always comes, to nation as to individual ; and alwa ys the knave deceives himself, and proves a failure. Hypocrisy is the homage that vice and wrong pa y to virtue and justice. It is .Satan attempting to clothe himself in the angelic vesture of light. It is equall y detestable in morals, politics, and religion; in the man and in the nation. To do inju stice under the pretence of equit y and fairness; to reprove vice in public and co mmit it in private; to pretend to charitab le opinion and censoriousl y condemn ; to profess the principles of Masonic beneficen ce, and close the ear to the wail of distress and the cr y of suffering; to eulogize the intell igence of the people, and plot to deceive and be-tra y them by means of their ignorance and simplic ity; to prate of purit y, and peculate; of honor, and basel y abandon a sinking cause; of disinterestedness, and sell one's vote for place and power, are hypocrisies as comm on as they are infamous and disgraceful. To steal the liver y of the Court of God to serve the Devil withal; to pretend to believe in a God of mer cy and a Redeemer of love, and persecute those of a different faith; to devour widow s' house s, and for a pretence make long pra yers; to preach continence, and wallow in lust; to inculcat e humility, and in pride surpas s Lucifer; to pay tithe, and omit the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith; to strain at a gnat, and swallow a came l; to make clean the outside of the cup and platter, keeping them full within of extortion and excess; to appear outwardl y righteous unto men, but within be full of h ypocrisy and iniquit y, is indeed to be like unto whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outward, but are within full of bones of the dead and of all uncleanness.

The Emp ire founded by a successful soldier, claims its ancient or natural boundaries, and makes necessit y and its safet y the plea for open robbery . The great Merchant Nation, gaining foothold in the Orient, finds a continual necessit y for extending its dom inion by arms, and subjugates India. The great Royalties and Despotisms, without a plea, partition among themse lves a Kingdom, dismem ber Poland, and prepare to wrangle over the dominions of the Crescent. To maintain the balance of power is a plea for the obliterat ion of States. Carthage, Genoa, and Venice, commercial Cities only, must acquire territor y by force or fraud, and beco me States. Alexander marches to the Indus; Ta merlane seeks universal empire; the Saracens conquer Spain and threaten Vienna. The thirst for power is never satisfied. It is insatiable. Neither men nor nations ever have power enough. When Rome was the mistress of the world, the Emp erors caused themselves to be wor shipped as gods. The Church of Rome claimed despotism over the soul, and over the whole life from the cradle to the grave. It gave and sold absolutions for past and future sins. It clai med to be infallible in matters of faith. It decimated Europe to purge it of heretics. It decimated America to convert the Mexicans and Peruvians. It gave and took away thrones; and by excom munication and interdict closed the gates of Paradise against Nations, Spain, haughty with its dominion over the Indies, endeavored to crush out Protestantis m in the Netherlands, while Philip the Second marr ied the Queen of England, and the pair sought to win that kingdom back to its allegianc e to the Papal throne. After- ward Spain attempted to conquer it with her \"invincible\" Armada. Napoleon set his relatives and captains on thrones, and parcelled among them half of Europe. The Czar rules over an empire more gigantic than Rome. The history of all is or will be the same, – acquisition, dismem berment, ruin. There is a judgment of God against all that is unjust. To seek to sub jugate the will of others and take the soul captive, because it is the exercise of the highest power, seems to be the highest object of hum an ambition. It is at the botto m of all prosely ting and propagandis m, from that of Mesmer to that of the Church of Rome and the French Republic. That was the apostolate alike of Joshua and of Mahomet. Masonry alone preaches Tolerat ion, the right of m an to abide by his own faith, the right of all States to govern the mselves. It rebukes alike the monarch who seeks to extend his dominions by conquest, the Church that claims the right to repress heresy by fire and steel, and the confederation of States that insist on maint aining a union b y force and restoring brotherhood by slaughter and sub jugation. It is natural, when we are wronged, to desire revenge; and to persuade ourselves that we desire it less for our own satisfaction than to prevent a repetit ion of the wrong, to which the doer would be encouraged by immunity coupled with the profit of the wrong. To submi t to be cheated is to encourage the cheater to continue; and we are quite apt to regard ourselves as God's chosen instrum ents to inflict His vengeance, and for Him and in His stead to discourage wrong by making it fruitless and its punishm ent sure. Revenge has been said to be \"a kind of wild ju stice;\" but it is alway s taken in anger, and therefore is unworthy of a great soul, which ought not to suffer its equanim ity to be disturbed by ingratitude or villainy. The injuries done us by the base are as much unworthy of our angr y notice as those done u s by the insects and the beasts; and when we crush the adder, or slay the wolf Page 56 of 621"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike or hyena, we should do it without being moved to anger, and with no more feeling of revenge than we have in rooting up a noxious weed. And if it be not in human nature not to take revenge by way of punishm ent, let the Mason truly consider that in doing so he is God 's agent, and so let his revenge be measured by justice and temper ed by mercy. The law of G od is, that the consequences of wrong and cruelty and crime shall be their punishment; and the injured and the wronged and the indignant are as much His instrum ents to enforce that law, as the diseases and public detestat ion, and the verdict of histor y and the execration of posterit y are. No one will say that the Inquisitor who has racked and burned the innocent; the Spaniard who hewed Indian infants, living, into pieces with his sword, and fed the mangled limbs to his blood- hounds; the military tyrant who has shot men without trial, the knave who ha s robbed or betrayed his State, the fraudulent banker or bankrupt who has beggared orphans, the public officer who has violated his oath, the judge who has s old injustice, the legislator who has enabled Incapaci ty to work the ruin of the State, ought not to be punished. Let them be so; and let the injured or the sympathizing be the instrumen ts of God's just vengeance; but always out of a higher feeling than mer e personal revenge. Remember that every moral characterist ic of man finds its protot ype among creatures of lower intelligenc e; that the cruel foulness of the h yena, the savage rapacit y of the wolf, the merciless rage of the tiger, the crafty treacher y of the panther, are found among mankind, and ought to excite no other emo tion, when found in the man, than when found in the beast. Why should the true man be angr y with the geese that hiss, the peacocks that strut, the asses that bray, and the apes that imitate and chatter, although they wear the human form? Alway s, also, it remains true, that it is more noble to forgive than to take revenge; and that, in general, we ought too mu ch to despise those w ho wrong us, to feel the emotion of anger, or to desire revenge. At the sphere of the Sun , you are in the region of LIG HT. * * * * The Hebrew word for gold , ZAHAB, also me ans Light , of which the Sun is to the Earth the great source. So, in the great Oriental allegor y of the Hebrew s, the River PISON compasses the land of Gold or Light ; and the River GIHON the land of Ethiopia or Darkness . What light is , we no more know than the ancients did. According to the mod ern hypothesis, it is not composed of luminous particles shot out from the sun with immense velocity; but that body only impresses, on the ether which fills all space, a powerful vibrator y movement that extends, in the form of luminous waves, bey ond the most distant planets, supply ing them with light and heat. To the ancients, it was an outflowing from the Deity. To us, as to the m, it is the apt symbol of truth and knowledge. To us, also, the upward journey of the soul through the Spheres is s ymbolical; but we are as little informed as they whence the soul comes, where it has its origin, and whither it goes after death. They endeavored to have some belief and faith, some creed, upon those points. At the present day, men are satisfied to think nothing in regard to all that, and only to believe that the soul is a something separate from the body and out-living it, but whether existing before it, neither to inquire nor care. No one asks whether it emanates from the Deity, or is created out of nothing, or is generated like the bod y, and the issue of the souls of the father and the moth er. Let us not smile, therefore, at the ideas of the ancients, until we have a better belief; but accept their symbols as meaning that the soul is of a Divine nature, originating in a sphere nearer the Deity, and returning to that when freed from the Page 57 of 621"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike enthrall ment of the bod y; and that it can only return there when purified of all the sordidness and sin which have, as it were, become part of its substance, by its connection with the bod y. It is not strange that, thousands of y ears ago, men worshipped the Sun, and that to-day that worship continues among the Parsees. O riginally they looked be yond the orb to the invisible God, of whom the Sun's light, seemingl y identica l with generation and life, was the manifestation and outflowing. Long before the Chaldæan shepherds watched it on their plains, it came up regularl y, as it now does, in the morning, like a god, and again sank, like a king retiring, in the west, to return again in due ti me in the same array of majesty. We worship Imm utability. It was that steadfast, immutable character of the Sun that the men of Baalbec worshipped. His light-giving and life- giving powers were secondar y attributes. The one grand idea that compe lled worship was the characteristi c of God which the y saw reflected in his light, and fancied they saw in its original ity the changelessness of Deit y. He had seen thrones crumbl e, earthquakes shake the world and hurl down mount ains. Beyond Olympus, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, he had gone dail y to his abode, and had com e daily again in the morning to behold the temples they built to his worship. They personified him as BRAHMA, AMUN, OS IRIS, BEL, ADONIS, MALK ARTH, MITHRA S, and APOLLO; and the nations that did so grew old and died. Moss grew on the capitals of the great columns of his te mples, and he shone on the moss. Grain b y grain the dust of his temp les crumbl ed and fell, and was borne off on. the wind, and still he shone on crumb ling column and architrave. The roof fell crashing on the pavemen t, and he shone in on the Holy of Holies with unchanging rays. It was not strange that men worshipped the Sun. There is a water- plant, on whose broad leaves the drops of water roll about without uniting, like drops of mercur y. So arguments on points of faith, in politics or religion, roll over the surface of the mind. An argument that convinces one mind has no effect on another. Few intellects, or souls that are the negations of intellec t, have any logical power or capaci ty. There is a singular obliquit y in the human mind that makes the false logic more effectiv e than the true with nine- tenths of those w ho are regarded as men of intell ect. Even among the judges, not one in ten can argue logicall y. Each mind sees the truth, distorted through its own med ium. Truth, to most men, is like matter in the spheroidal state. Like a drop of cold water on the surface of a red-hot me tal plate, it dances, tremb les, and spins, and never comes into contact with it; and the mind may be plunged into truth, as the hand moist ened with sulphurous acid may into me lted metal, and be not even warmed by the immersion. * * * * * * The word Khairū m or Khūrūm is a compound one.

The Egyptian Deity called by the Greeks \" Horus ,\" was Her-Ra , or Har-oeris , Hor or Har , the Sun. Hari is a Hindu name of the Sun. Ari-al , Ar-es , Ar , Aryaman , Areimonios , the AR meaning Fire or Flame , are of the same kindred. Herme s or Har-me s , ( Aram , Remus , Hara m , Hara meias ), was Kadmos, the Divine Light or Wisdo m. Mar-kuri , says Mover s, is Mar , the Sun. In the Hebrew, A OOR, is Light , Fire , or the Sun . Cyrus , said Ctesias, was so named from Kuros , the Sun. Kuris , Hesychius says, was Adonis. Apollo, the Sun-god, was called Kurraios , from Kurra , a city in Phocis. The people of Kurene , originall y Ethiopians or Cuthites, worshipped the Sun under the title of Achoor and Achōr . We know, through a precise testimony in the ancient annals of Tsūr, that the principal festivity of Mal-karth , the incarnation of the Sun at the Winter Solstice, held at Tsūr, was called his rebirth or his awakening , and that it was celebrated by means of a pyre, on which the god was s upposed to regain, through the aid of fire, a new life. This festival was celebrat ed in the month Peritius ( Barith ), the second da y of which corresponded to the 25th of December. KHUR-U M, King of Ty re, Movers says, first performed this ceremon y. These facts we learn from Josephus , Servius on the Æneid, and the Dionysiacs of Nonnu s ; and through a coincidenc e that cannot be fortuitous, the same day was at Rome the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti , the festal day of the invincible Sun. U nder this title, HERCULES, HAR- acles , was wor shipped at Tsūr. Thus, while the temple was being erected, the death and resurrection of a Sun-G od was annuall y represented at Tsūr, by Solomon's all y, at the winter solstice, by the pyre of MAL-KARTH, the Tsūrian Haracles. AROERIS or H AR- oeris , the elder HORUS, is from the same old root that in the Hebrew has the form Aūr , or, with the definite article prefixed, Haūr , Light, or the Light, splendor, flame, the Sun and. his ra ys. The hierogly phic of the younger HORUS wa s the point in a circle; of the Elder, a pair of e yes; and the festival of the thirti eth day of the month Epiphi , when the sun and moon were supposed to be in the same right line with the earth, was called \" The birth-day of the eyes of Ho rus .\" In a papyrus published by Champol lion, this god is sty led \" Haroeri , Lord of the Solar Spirits, the beneficent eye of the Sun.\" Plutarch calls him \" Har-pocrates ;\" but there is no trace of the latter part of the name in the hierogl yphic legends. He is the son of O SIRIS and Isis; and is represented sitting on a throne supported by lions ; the same word, in Egyptian, meaning Lion and Sun .

The pal m-tree, and the lamp in the shape of a boat, appeared in the procession. If the symbol we are speaking of is not a mere modern invention, it is to these things it alludes.

It is certain at some time to be wholly governed by agitators appealing to all the baser ele ments of the popular nature; by moneyed corporations; by those enriched by the depreciat ion of governm ent securities or paper; b y small attorne ys, schemers, money- jobbers, s peculators and adventurers – an ignoble oligarch y, enriched by the distresses of the State, and fattened on the miseries of the people. Then all the deceitfu l visions of equality and the rights of man end; and the wronged and plundered State can regain a real liberty only by passing through \"great varieties of untried being,\" purified in its transmigration by fire and blood. In a Republic, it soon comes to pass that parties gather round the negative and positive poles of some opinion or notion, and that the intolerant spirit of a triumphan t majorit y will allow no deviation from the standard of orthodoxy which it has set up for itself. Freedom of opinion will be profes sed and pretended to, but every one will exercise it at the peril of being banished fro n politic al communion with those who hold the reins and prescribe the policy to be pursued. Slavishness to part y and ob sequiousness to the popular whims go hand in hand. Politica l independence only occurs in a fossil state; and men's opinions grow out of the acts they have been constrained to do or sanction. Flattery, either of individual or people, corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of mor e service to the people than to kings. A Cæ sar, securely seated in power, cares less for it than a free democracy; nor will his appetite for it grow to exorbitance, as that of a people will, until it becomes insatiate. The effect of libert y to individuals is, that they may do what they please; to a people, it is to a great extent the same. If accessible to flattery, as this is alwa ys interested, and resorted to on low and base mot ives, and for evil purposes, either individual or people is sure, in doing what it pleases, to do what in honor and conscience should have been left undone.

The first principle in a Republic ought to be, \"that no man or set of men is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; which not being descendible, neither ought the offices of magistr ate, legislatur e, nor judge, to be hereditar y.\" It is a volum e of Truth and Wisdom, a lesson for the study of nations, e mbodied in a single sentence, and expressed in language which every man can understand. If a deluge of despotism were to overthrow the world, and destro y all institutions under which freedom is protected, so that they should no longer be remembered among men, this sentence, preserved, would be sufficient to rekindle the fires of libert y and revive the race of free m en. But, to preserve liberty, another must be added: \"that a free State does not confer office as a reward, especiall y for questionable services, unless she seeks her own ruin; but all officers are employed by her, in consideration solely of their will and ability to render service in the future; and therefore that the best and most competen t are always to be preferred.\" For, if there is to be any other rule, that of hereditar y succession is perhaps as good as any . By no other rule is it possible to preserve the liberties of the State. By no other to intrust the power of making the laws to those only who have that keen instinctive sense of injustice and wrong w hich enables them to detect baseness and corruption in their most secret hiding- places, and that moral courage and generous manlin ess and gallant independence that make them fearless in dragging out the perpetrators to the light of day, and calling down upon them the scorn and indignation of the world. The flatterers of the people are never such men. On the contrar y, a time always comes to a Republic, when it is not content, like Tiberius, with a single Sejanus, but must have a host; and when those most prominent in the lead of affairs are men without reputation, statesmanship, ability, or information, the mere hacks of part y, owing their places to tricker y and want of qualific ation, with none of the qualities of head or heart that make great and wise men, and, at the same time, filled with all the narrow conceptions and bitter intoleranc e of political bigotry. These die; and the world is none the wiser for what the y have said and done. Their na mes sink in the bottom less pit of oblivion; but their acts of folly or knaver y curse the body politic and at last prove its ruin. Politicians, in a free State, are generall y hollow, heartless, and selfish. Their own aggrandise ment is the end of their patriotism ; and they always look with secret satisfaction on the disappointm ent or fall of one who se loftier genius and superior talents over-shado w their own self-impor tance, or who se integri ty and incorruptibl e honor are in the way of their selfish ends. The influence of the small aspirants is alwa ys against the great man. His accession to power ma y be almost for a lifeti me. One of the mselves will be more easily displaced, and each hopes to succeed him; and so it at length comes to pass that men impudently aspire to and actuall y win the highest stations, who are unfit for the lowest clerkships; and incapac ity and mediocr ity become the surest passports to office. The consequence is, that those who feel the mselves competen t and qualified to serve the people, refuse with disgust to enter into the struggle for office, where the wicked and jesuitical doctrine that all is fair in politics is an excuse for ever y species of low villain y; Page 63 of 621"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and those w ho seek even the highest places of the State do not rely upon the power of a magnanimous spirit, on the sympathizing impulses of a great soul, to stir and move the people to generous, noble, and heroic resolves, and to wise and man ly action; but, like spaniels erect on their hind legs, with fore-paws ob sequiousl y suppliant, fawn, flatter, and actually beg for votes. Rather than descend to this, the y stand contem ptuousl y aloof, disdainfull y refusing to court the people, and acting on the max im, that \"mankind has no title to dem and that we shall serve them in spite of the mselves.\" * * * * * * It is lamen table to see a country split into factions, each following this or that great or brazen- fronted leader with a blind, unreasoning, unquestioning hero-worship; it is contemptible to see it divided into parties, whose sole end is the spoils of victor y, and their chiefs the low, the base, the venal and the smal l. Such a country is in the last stages of decay, and near its end, no ma tter how pro sperous it may seem to be. It wrangles over the volcano and the earthquake. But it is certain that no government can be conducted by the men of the people, and for the people, without a rigid adherence to those principles which our reason co mmends as fixed and sound. These must be the tests of parties, m en, and measures. Once determ ined, they must be inexorable in their applica tion, and all must either come up to the standard or declare against it. Men may betray: principles never can. Oppression is one invariable consequence of misplac ed confidence in treacherous man, it is never the result of the working or application of a sound, j ust, well-tried principle. Compro mises which bring funda mental principles into doubt, in order to unite in one party men of antagonistic creeds, are frauds, and end in ruin, the just and natural consequence of fraud. Whenever you have settled upon y our theory and creed, sanction no departure from it in practice, on any ground of expedienc y. It is the Master's word. Yield it up neither to flattery nor force! Let no defeat or persecution rob you of it! Believe that he who once blundered in states manship will blunder again; that such blunders are as fatal as crimes; and that politi cal near-sightedness does not improve by age. There are alwa ys more impostors than seers among public men, more false prophets than true ones, more prophets of Baal than of Jehovah; and Jerusale m is alwa ys in danger from the Assyrians. Sallust said that after a State has been corrupted b y luxury and idleness, it may by its mere greatness bear up under the burden of its vices. But even while he wrote, Rome, of which he spoke, had played out her masquerad e of freedom. Other causes than luxury and sloth destroy Republics. If smal l, their larger neighbors extinguish them by absorption. If of great extent, the cohesive force is too feeble to hold the m together, and they fall to pieces by their own weight. The paltry ambition of small men disintegrates them. The want of wisdom in their councils creates exasperating issues. Usurpation of power pla ys its part, incapaci ty seconds corruption, the storm rises, and the fragments of the incoherent raft strew the sandy shores, reading to mankind another lesson for it to disregard.

It is this: \"In ever y right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the base and perpendicular is equal to the square of the hypothenuse.\" The square of a number is the product of that number, multi-plied by itself. Thus, 4 is the square of 2, and 9 of 3. The first ten numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; their squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100; and 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 are the differences between each square and that which precedes it; giving us the sacred numbers, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Of these numb ers, the square of 3 and 4, added together, gives the square of 5; and those of 6 and 8, the square of 10; and if a right- angled triangle be formed, the base measuring 3 or 6 parts, and the perpendicul ar 4 or 8 parts, the hypothenuse will be 5 or 10 parts; and if a square is erected on each side, these squares being subdivided into squares each side of which is one part in length, there will be as man y of these in the square erected on the hypothenuse as in the other two squares together. Now the Eg yptians arranged their deities in Triads – the FATHER or the Spirit or Active Principle or Generative Power; the MOTHER, or Matter, or the Passive Principle, or the Conceptive Power; and the SON, Issue or Product , the Universe, proceeding from the two principles. These were OSIRI S, ISIS, and HO RUS. In the same way, PLATO gives u s Page 65 of 621"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Thought the Father ; Primitive Matter the Mother ; and Kosmo s the World , the Son , the Universe ani mated by a soul. Triads of the same kind are found in the Kabalah. PLUTARCH say s, in his book De Iside et Osiride , \"But the better and diviner nature consists of three, that which exists within the Intellect only, and Matter, and that which proceeds from these, which the Greeks call Kosmo s ; of which three, Plato is wont to call the Intelligib le, the 'Idea, Exemp lar, and Father'; Matter, 'the Mother, the Nur se, and the place and receptacle of generation'; and the issue of these two, 'the Offspring and Genesis,'\" the Kosmos, \"a word signify ing equally Beauty and Order , or the Universe itself.\" You will not fail to notice that Beauty is symbolized by the Junior Warden in the South. Plutarch continues to say that the Egyptians compared the universal nature to what they called the most beautiful and perfect triangle, as Plato does, in that nuptial diagram, as it is term ed, which he has introduced into his Com monwealth. Then he adds that this triangle is right-angled, and its sides respectivel y as 3, 4, and 5; and he sa ys, \"We must suppose that the perpendicul ar is designed by them to represent the mascul ine nature, the base the feminine, and that the hypothenuse is to be looked upon as the offspring of both; and accordingl y the first of them will aptl y enough represent OSIRIS, or the prim e cause; the second, ISIS, or the receptive capacit y; the last, HORUS, or the com mon effect of the other two. For 3 is the first number which is composed of even and odd; and 4 is a square whose side is equal to the even number 2; but 5, being generated, as it were, out of the preceding numbers, 2 and 3, ma y be said to have an equal relation to both of them, as to its common parents.\" * * * * * * The clasped hands is another symbol which was u sed by PYTHAGORAS. It represented the number 10, the sacred numb er in which all the preceding numbers were contained; the number expressed by the mysterious TETRACTYS, a figure borrowed b y him and the Hebrew priests alike from the Egyptian sacred science, and which ought to be replaced among the symbols of the Master' s Degree, where it of right belongs. The Hebrews formed it thus, with the letters of the Divine nam e: The Tetractys thus leads you, not onl y to the stud y of the Pythagorean philosophy as to numbers, but also to the Kabalah, and will aid you in discovering the True Word, and understanding what was mean t by \"The Music of the Spheres.\" Modern science strikingl y confirms the ideas of Pythagoras in regard to the properties of numbers, and that they Page 66 of 621"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike govern in the Universe. Long before his ti me, nature had extracted her cube-roots and her squares. * * * * * * All the FORCES at man's disposal or under man's control, or subject to man's influence, are his working tools . The friendship and sympathy that knit heart to heart are a force like the attraction of cohesion, b y which the sand y particles became the solid rock. If this law of attrac tion or cohesion were taken away, the material worlds and suns would dissolve in an instant into thin invisible vapor. If the ties of friendship, affection, and love were annulled, mankind would beco me a raging mul titude of wild and savage beasts of pre y. The sand hardens into rock under the immense superincumben t pressure of the ocean, aided sometimes by the irresistible energy of fire; and when the pressure of cala mity and danger is upon an order or a country , the members or the citizens ought to be the more closely united by the cohesion of s ympathy and inter- dependence. Moralit y is a force. It is the magne tic attraction of the heart toward Truth and Virtue. The needle, imbued with this mystic property , and pointing unerringl y to the north, carries the mariner safely over the trackless ocean, through storm and darkness, until his glad eyes behold the beneficen t beacons that welco me him to safe and hospitable harbor. Then the hearts of those who love him are gladdened, and his home made happy; and this gladness and happiness are due to the silent, unostentatious, unerring monitor that was the sailor's guide over the weltering waters. But if drifted too far northward, he finds the needle no longer true, but pointing elsewhere than to the north, what a feeling of helplessness falls upon the dismayed mariner, what utter loss of energy and courage! It is as if the great axioms of moral ity were to fail and be no longer true, leaving the human soul to drift helplessl y, eyeless like Prome theus, at the mer cy of the uncertain, faithless currents of the deep. Honor and Duty are the pole- stars of a Mason, the Dioscuri, b y never losing sight of which he may avoid disastrous s hipwreck. These Palinurus watched, until, overco me by sleep, and the vessel no longer guided trul y, he fell into and was s wallowed up by the insatiable sea. So the Mason who loses sight of these, and is no longer governed b y their beneficent and potential force, is lost, and sinking out of sight, will disappear unhonored and unwept. The force of electr icity, analogous to that of sympathy, and by means of which great thoughts or base s uggestions, the utterances of noble or ignoble natures, flash instantaneousl y over the nerves of nations; the force of growth, fit type of immortality, lying dormant three thousand ye ars in the wheat- grains buried with their mummies by the old Egyptians; the forces of expansion and contract ion, developed in the earthquake and the tornado, and giving birth to the wonderful achieve ments of steam, have their parallelisms in the moral world, in individuals, and nations. Growth is a necessit y for nations as for men. Its cessation is the beginning of decay . In the nation as well as the plant it is mysterious, and it is irresistible. The earthquakes that rend nations asunder, overturn thrones, and engulf monar chies and republics, have been long prepared for, like the volcanic eruption. Revolutions have long roots in the past. The force exerted is in direct proportion to the previous restraint and compression. The true states man ought to see in progress the causes that are in due time to produce them; and he who does not is but a blind leader of the blind.

The waters, falling from Heaven as rain and dews, slowly disintegrat e the granite mounta ins; abrade the plains, leaving hills and ridges of denudation as their monuments; scoop out the valle ys, fill up the seas, narrow the rivers, and after the lapse of thousands on thousands of silent centuries, prepare the great alluvia for the growth of that plant, the snowy envelope of who se seeds is to emplo y the loo ms of the world, and the abundance or penury of who se crops s hall determine whether the weavers and spinners of other realms shall have work to do or starve. So Public Opinion is an im mense force; and its currents are as inconstant and incomprehensib le as those of the atmospher e. Nevertheless, in free governments, it is omnipo tent; and the business of the states man is to find the means to shape, control, and direct it. According as that is done, it is benefici al and conservative, or destructive and ruinous. The Public Opinion of the civil ized world is International Law; and it is so great a force, though with no certain and fixed boundaries, that it can even constrain the victorious despot to be generous, and aid an oppressed people in its struggle for independence. Habit is a great force; it is second nature, even in trees. It is as strong in nations as in men. So also are Prejudices, which are given to men and nations as the passions are, – as forces, valuable, if properl y and skillfull y availed of; destructive, if unskillfully handled. Above all, the Love of Countr y, State Pride, the Love of Home, are forces of im mense power. Encourage them all. Insist upon the m in your public men. Permanenc y of home is necessar y to patriotis m. A migratory race will have litt le love of country . State pride is a mere theory and chim era, where men remove from State to State with indifference, like the Arabs, who camp here to-day and there to-morrow. If you have Eloquence, it is a migh ty force. See that you use it for good purposes – to teach, exhort, ennoble the people, and not to misl ead and corrupt the m. Corrupt and venal orators are the assassins of the public liberties and of public morals. The Will is a force; its limits as yet unknown. It is in the power of the will that we chiefl y see the spiritual and divine in man. There is a seem ing identity between his will that moves other men, and the Creative Will whose action seems so incomprehensib le. It is the m en of will and action , not the men of pure intellect, that govern the world. Finally, the three greatest moral forces are FAITH, w hich is the only true WISDOM, and the very foundation of all governmen t; HOPE, which is STRENGTH, and insures success; and CHARITY, which is BEAUTY, and alone makes animated, united effort possible. These forces are within the reach of all men; and an association of men, actuated by them, ought to exercise an immense power in the world. If Masonry does not, it is because she has ceased to posse ss them. Wisdom in the man or states man, in king or priest, largely consists in the due appreciation of these forces; and upon the general non -appreciat ion of some of them the fate of nations often depends. What hecatom bs of lives often hang upon the not weighing or not sufficientl y weighing the force of an idea, such as, for exa mple, the reverence for a flag, or the blind attachm ent to a form or constitution of governm ent!

Everything, it is asserted, is the product of human labor; but the gold or the diamond which one accidental ly finds without labor is not so. What is the value of the labor bestowed b y the husbandm an upon his crops, compar ed with the value of the sunshine and rain, without with his labor avails nothing? Com merce carried on by the labor of man, adds to the value of the products of the field, the mine, or the workshop, b y their transportation to different markets; but how much of this increase is due to the rivers do wn which these products float, to the winds that urge the keels of com merce over the ocean! Who can estim ate the value of mora lity and manl iness in a State, of mora l worth and intellectual knowledge? These are the sunshine and rain of the State. The winds, with their change- able, fickle, fluctuating currents, are apt emblems of the fickle humors of the populace, its passions, its heroic i mpulses, its enthusias ms. Woe to the states man who does not estimate these as values! Even music and song are someti mes found to have an incalcul able value. Every nation has some song of a proven value, more easily counted in lives than dollars. The Marseillaise was worth to revolutionar y France, who shall sa y how man y thousand men? Peace also is a great ele ment of prosperit y and wealth; a value not to be calcula ted. Social intercourse and association of men in beneficent Orders have a value not to be esti mated in coin. The illustrious examples of the Past of a nation, the memories and im mortal thoughts of her great and wise thinkers, statesm en, and heroes, are the invaluable legacy of that Past to the Present and Future. And all these have not only the values of the loftier and mor e excellen t and priceless kind, but also an actual money -value, since it is only when co- operating with or aided or enabled by these, that human labor creates wealth.

Man advances onl y by degrees. The removal of one pressing calam ity gives courage to attempt the remova l of the remain ing evils, rendering men more sensitive to them, or perhaps sen sitive for the first ti me. Serfs that writhe under the whip are not disquieted about their politica l rights; manum itted from personal slavery , they become sensitive to politi cal oppres sion. Liberated from arbitrar y power, and governed b y the law alone, they begin to scrutinize the law itself, and desire to be governed, not only by law, but by what they deem the best law.

It is quite true that the advance of humanit y is slow, and that it often pauses and retrogrades. In the kingdoms of the earth we do not see despotisms retiring and yielding the ground to self-governing communities.

Poverty in all its most hideous forms still exists in the great cities; and the cancer of pauperism has its roots in the hearts of kingdoms. Men there take no measure of their wants and their own power to supply them, but live and multiply like the beasts of the field, – Providence having apparentl y ceased to care for them. Intellig ence never visits these, or it makes its appearance as some new developm ent of villain y. War has not ceased; still there are battles and sieges. Homes are still unhappy , and tears and anger and spite make hells where there should be heavens. So much the more necessit y for Masonry ! So much wider the field of its labors! So much the more need for it to begin to be true to itself, to revive from its asph yxia, to repent of its apostas y to its true creed! Undoubtedl y, labor and death and the sexual passion are essential and permanen t conditions of human existence, and render perfection and a millennium on earth impossibl e. Alway s, – it is the decree of Fate! – the vast m ajority of men must toil to live, and cannot find time to cultiva te the intellig ence. Man, kno wing he is to die, will not sacrifice the present enjoyment for a greater one in the future. The love of woman cannot die out; and it has a terrible and uncontrollab le fate, increased by the refinem ents of civilization. Woman is the veritabl e syren or goddess of the y oung. But society can be improved; and free governm ent is possible for States; and freedom of thought and conscience is no longer wholly utopian. Alread y we see that Emperors prefer to be elect ed by universal suffrage; that States are convey ed to Empires by vote; and that Empires are administered with someth ing of the spirit of a Republic, being little else than democrac ies with a single head, ruling through one man, one representative, instead of an assembl y of representativ es. And if Priesthoods still govern, the y now come before the lait y to prove, by stress of argumen t, that they ought to govern. They are obliged to evoke the ver y reason which they are bent on supplanting. Accordingl y, men become daily more free, because the freedom of the m an lies in his reason. He can reflect upon his own future conduct, and summon up its consequences; he can take wide views of human life, and lay down rules for constant guidance. Thus he is relieved of the t yranny of sense and passion, and enabled at any time to live according to the whole light of the knowledge that is within him, instead of being driven, like a dry leaf on the wings of the wind, b y every present impu lse. Herein lies the freedom of the man as regarded in connection with the necessity imposed by the omnipoten ce and fore- knowledge of God. So much light, so much liberty. When emperor and church appeal to reason there is naturall y universal suffrage. Therefore no one need lose courage, nor believe that labor in the cause of Progress will be labor wasted. There is no wa ste in nature, either of Matter, Force, Act, or Thought. A Thought is as much the end of life as an Action; and a single Thought someti mes works greater results than a Revolution, even Revolutions themselves. Still there should not be divorce between Thought and Action. The true Thought is that in which life culmin ates. But all wise and true Thought produces Action. It is generative, like the light; and light and the deep shadow of the passing cloud are the gifts of the prophets of the race.

The multitude of laborers cannot acquire it. Most men attain to a very low standard of it. It is incomp atible with the ordinar y and indispensable avocations of life. A whole world of error as well as of labor, go to make one reflective man. In the most advanced nation of Europe there are mor e ignorant than wise, mor e poor than rich, more automatic laborers, the mere creatures of habit, than reasoning and reflectiv e men. The proportion is at least a thousand to one. Unanimi ty of opinion is so obtained. It only exists among the multitude who do not think, and the politica l or spiritual priesthood who think for that multitude, who think how to guide and govern the m. When men begin to reflect, they begin to differ. The great problem is to find guides who will not seek to be tyrants. This is needed even mor e in respect to the heart than the head. Now, every man earns his special share of the produce of human labor, by an incessant scrambl e, by trickery and deceit. Useful knowledge, honorably acquired, is too often used after a fashion not honest or reasonable, so that the studies of y outh are far more noble than the practices of manhood. The labor of the farmer in his fields, the generous returns of the earth, the benignant and favoring skies, tend to make him earnest, provident, and grateful; the education of the mark et-place makes him querulous, craft y, envious, and an intolerable niggard. Masonry seeks to be this beneficent, unamb itious, disinterested guide; and it is the ver y condition of all great structures that the sound of the hammer and the clink of the trowel should be always heard in some part of the building. With faith in man, hope for the future of human ity, loving-kindness for our fellows, Masonry and the Mason must always work and teach. Let each do that for which he is best fitted. The teacher also is a workman. Praiseworth y as the active navigator is, who com es and goes and mak es one clim e partake of the treasures of the other, and one to share the treasures of all, he who keeps the beacon- light upon the hill is also at his post. Masonry has alread y helped cast down some idols from their pedestals, and grind to impalpable dust some of the links of the chains that held men's souls in bondage. That there has been progress needs no other demonstra tion than that you may now reason with men, and urge upon the m, without danger of the rack or stake, that no doctrines can be apprehended as truths if they contradic t each other, or contradict other truths given us by God. Long before the Reform ation, a monk, who had found his wa y to heresy without the help of Martin Luther, not venturing to breathe aloud into an y living ear his anti- papal and treasonable doctrines, wrote them on parchmen t, and sealing up the perilous record, hid it in the massive walls of his monaster y. There was no friend or brother to whom he could intrust his secret or pour forth his soul. It was some consolation to imagin e that in a future age some one migh t find the parch ment, and the seed be found not to have been sown in vain. What if the truth should have to lie dormant as long before germina ting as the wheat in the Egyptian mummy? Speak it, nevertheless, again and again, and let it take its chance! The rose of Jericho grows in the sandy deserts of Arabia and on the Syrian housetops. Scarcel y six inches high, it loses its leaves after the flowering season, and dries up into the form of a ball. Then it is uprooted by the winds, and carried, blown, or tossed across the desert, into the sea. There, feeling the contact of the water, it unfolds itself, expands its branches, and expels its seeds from their seed-vessels. These, when saturated with water, are carried by the tide and laid on the seashore. Man y are lost, as man y individua l lives of Page 71 of 621"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike men are useless. But many are thrown back again from the seashore into the desert, where, by the virtue of the sea- water that they have imb ibed, the roots and leaves sprout and the y grow into fruitful plants, which will, in their turns, like their ancestors, be whirled into the sea. God will not be less careful to provide for the germin ation of the truths you may boldly utter forth. \" Cast ,\" He has said, \" thy bread upon the waters, and after many days it shall return to thee again .\" Initiation does not change: we find it again and again, and always the same, through all the ages. The last disciples of Pascalis Martinez are still the children of Orpheus; but they adore the realiz er of the antique philosophy , the Incarnate Word of the Christians. Pythagoras, the great divulger of the philosoph y of numbers, visited all the sanctuaries of the world. He went into Judæa, where he procured himself to be circu mcised, that he might be admitted to the secrets of the Kabalah, which the prophets Ezekiel and Daniel, not without some reservations, communicated to him. Then, not without some difficult y, he succeeded in being adm itted to the Egyptian initiation, upon the recommendation of King Amasis. The power of his genius supplied the deficienc ies of the imperfe ct communications of the Hierophants, and he himself became a Master and a Revealer, Pythagoras defined God: a Living and Ab solute Verity clothed with Light. He said that the Word was N umber manifested by Form. He mad e all descend from the Tetractys , that is to say , from the Quaternar y. God, he said again, is the Supreme Music, the nature of which is Harmon y. Pythagoras gave the magistra tes of Crotona this great religious, political and social precept: \"There is no evil that is not preferable to Anarchy .\" Pythagoras said, \"Even as there are three divine notions and three intellig ible regions, so there is a triple word, for the Hierarchical Order always manifests itself by threes. There are the word simple, the word hierogl yphical, and the word sy mbolic: in other terms, there are the word that expresses, the word that conceals, and the word that signifies; the whole hieratic intellig ence is in the perfect knowledge of these three degrees.\" Pythagoras enveloped doctrine with symbols, but carefull y eschewed personifications and images, which, he thought, sooner or later produced idolatry. The Holy Kabalah, or tradition of the children of Seth, was carried from Chaldæa by Abraham, taught to the Egyptian priesthood b y Joseph, recovered and purified by Moses, concealed under s ymbols in the Bible, revealed by the Saviour to Saint John, and contained, entire, under hieratic figures analogous to those of all antiquit y, in the Apocal ypse of that Apostle. The Kabalists consider God as the Intelligen t, Anima ted, Living Infinite. He is not, for them, either the aggregate of existences, or existence in the abstract, or a being philosophical ly definable. He is in all, distinct from all, and greater than all. His name even is ineffable; and yet this name only expresses the human ideal of His divinit y. What God is in Himself, it is not given to man to comprehend. Page 72 of 621"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike God is the absolute of Faith; but the absolute of Reason is BEIN G, יהוה . \" I am that I am ,\" is a wretched translation. Being, Existence, is by itself, and because it Is. The reason of Being, is Being itself. We may inquire, \"Why does something exist?\" that is, \"Why does such or such a thing exist?\" But we cannot, without being absurd, a sk, \"Wh y Is Being?\" That would be to suppose Being before Being. If Being had a cause, that cause would necessaril y Be; that is, the cause and effect would be identic al. Reason and science demonstrat e to us that the modes of Existence and Being balance each other in equilibriu m according to harmonious and hierarchi c laws. But a hierarch y is synthetized, in ascending, and becom es ever more and more monarchi al. Yet the reason cannot pause at a single chief, without being alarmed. at the abysses which it seems to leave above this Supreme Mon-arch. Therefore it is silent, and gives place to the Faith it adores. What is certain, even for science and the reason, is, that the idea of God is the grandest, the most holy, and the most useful of all the aspirations of man; that upon this belief morality reposes, with its eternal sanction. This belief, then, is in hum anity, the most real of the phenom ena of being; and if it were false, nature would affirm the absurd; nothingness would give form to life, and God would at the same time be and not be. It is to this philosophic and incontestab le reality, which is ter med The Idea of God, that the Kabalists give a name. In this name all others are contained. Its cyphers contain all the numbers; and the hierogl yphics of its letters express all the laws and all the things of nature. BEING IS BEIN G: the reason of Being is in Being: in the Be-ginning is the Word, and the Word in logic formula ted Speech, the spoken Reason; the Word is in God, and is God Himself, manifested to the Intellig ence. Here is what is above all the philosophies. This we must believe, under the penalty of never truly knowing an ything, and relapsing into the absurd skepticism of Pyrrho. The Priesthood, custodian of Faith, wholly rests upon this basis of knowledge, and it is in its teachings we must recognize the Divine Principle of the Eternal Word. Light is not Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants believed it to be; but onl y the instrum ent of the Spirit. It is not the body of the Protoplastes, as the Theurgists of the school of Alexandria taught, but the first physical manifestation of the Divine afflatus. God eternall y creates it, and man, in the image of God, modifies and seems to multiply it. The high mag ic is styled \"The Sacerdotal Art,\" and \"The Royal Art.\" In Eg ypt, Greece, and Rome, it could not but share the greatnesses and decadences of the Priesthood and of Royalty. Every philosophy hostile to the national worship and to its mysteries, was of necessit y hostile to the great political powers, which lose their grandeur, if they cease, in the eyes of the multitudes, to be the i mages of the Divine Power. Ever y Crown is shattered, when it clashes against the Tiara. Plato, writing to Diony sius the Younger, in regard to the nature of the First Principle, says: \"I must write to you in enigm as, so that if my letter be intercepted by land or sea, he who shall read it may in no degree comprehend it.\" And then he says, \"All things surround their Page 73 of 621"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike King; they are, on account of Him, and He alone is the cause of good things, Second for the Seconds and Third for the Thirds.\" There is in these few word s a complete summary of the Theolog y of the Sephiroth. \"The King \" is AINSOPH, Being Supreme and Absolute. From this centre, which is everywhere , all things ray forth; but we especiall y conceive of it in three manners and in three different spheres. In the Divine world (AZILUTH), which is that of the First Cause, and wherein the whole Eternit y of Things in the beginning existed as Unity , to be afterward, during Eternity uttered forth, clothed with form, and the attributes that constitute them matter, the First Principle is Single and First, and yet not the VERY Illi mitable Deity, incomprehensib le, undefinable ; but Himself in so far as man ifested by the Creative Thought. To comp are littleness with infinit y, – Arkwright, as inventor of the spinning- jenny, and not the man Arkwright otherwise and beyond that . All we can know of the Very God is, compar ed to His Wholeness, onl y as an infinitesi mal fraction of a unit, compared with an infinit y of Units. In the World of Creation, which is that of Second Causes [the Kabalistic World BRIAH], the Autocrac y of the First Principle is comple te, but we conceive of it only as the Cause of the Second Causes. Here it is manifest ed by the Binary , and is the Creative Principle passive. Finall y: in the third world, YEZIRAH, or of Format ion, it is revealed in the perfect Form, the Form of Forms, the World, the Supreme Beauty and Excell ence, the Created Perfection. Thus the Principle is at once the First, the Second, and the Third, since it is All in All, the Centre and Cause of all. It is not the genius of Plato that we here admire. We recognize only the exact knowledge of the Initiat e . The great Apostle Saint John did not borrow from the philosophy of Plato the opening of his Gospel. Plato, on the contrar y, drank at the same springs with Saint John and Philo; and John in the opening verses of his paraphrase, states the first principles of a dogma common to many schools, but in language especiall y belonging to Philo, whom it is evident he had read. The philosoph y of Plato, the greatest of human Revealers, could yearn toward the Word made man; the Gospel alone could give him to the world. Doubt, in presence of Being and its har monies; skepticis m, in the face of the eternal mathematics and the i mmutable laws of Life which make the Divinit y present and visible everywhere, as the Human is known and visible by its utterances of word and act, – is this not the most foolish of super stitions, and the most inexcusable as well as the most dangerous of all credulit ies? Thought, we know, is not a result or consequence of the organizat ion of matter, of the chem ical or other action or reaction of its particles, like effervescence and gaseous explosions. On the contrar y, the fact that Thought is manifested and realized in act human or act divine, proves the existence of an Entit y, or Unity , that thinks. And the Universe is the Infinite Utterance of one of an infinite number of Infinite Thoughts, which cannot but eman ate from an Infinite and Thinking Source. The cause is always equal, at least, to the effect; and ma tter cannot think, nor could it cause itself, or exist without cause, nor could nothing produce either forces or things; for in void nothingness no Forces can inhere. Admit a self-existent Force, and its Intelligen ce, or an Intelligent cause of it is admit ted, and at once GOD IS. The Hebrew allegor y of the Fall of Man, which is but a special variation of a universal legend, symbolizes one of the grandest and most universal allegories of science.

Injustice is the essence of Falsehood; and ever y false word is an inju stice. Injustice is the death of the Moral Being, as Falsehood is the poison of the Intelligence. The perception of the Light is the dawn of the Eternal Life, in Being. The Word of God, which creates the Light, seems to be uttered by every Intelligence that can take cognizance of Forms and will look. \"Let the Light BE! The Light, in fact, exists, in its condition of splendor, for those ey es alone that gaze at it; and the Soul, amorous of the spectacle of the beauties of the Universe, and appl ying its attention to that luminous writing of the Infinite Book, which is called \"The Visible,\" seems to utter, as God did on the dawn of the first day, that subli me and creative word, \"BE! LIGHT!\" It is not bey ond the tomb, but in life itself, that we are to seek for the m ysteries of death. Salvation or reprobation begins here below, and the terrestrial world too has its Heaven and its Hell. Alwa ys, even here below, virtue is rewarded; always, even here below, vice is punished; and that which mak es us sometimes believe in the impuni ty of evil- doers is that riches, those instrumen ts of good and of evil, seem sometimes to be given them at hazard. But woe to unjust men, when they possess the key of gold! It opens, for them, only the gate of the tomb and of Hell. All the true Initiates have recognized the usefulness of toil and sorrow. \"Sorrow,\" s ays a German poet, \"is the dog of that unknown s hepherd who guides the flock of men.\" To learn to suffer, to learn to die, is the discipline of Eternit y, the immortal Novitiate. The allegorica l picture of Cebes, in which the Divine Comed y of Dante was sketched in Plato's ti me, the description whereof has been preserved for us, and which man y painters of the middle age have reproduced by this description, is a monum ent at once philosophical and magi cal. It is a most comple te moral synthesis, and at the same time the most audacious demonstr ation ever given of the Grand Arcanum, of that secret whose revelation would overturn Earth and Heaven. Let no one expect us to give them its explanat ion! He who pas ses behind the veil that hides this mystery, understands that it is in its very nature inexplicabl e, and that it is death to those who win it by surprise, as well as to him who reveals it. This secret is the Royalty of the Sages, the Crown of the Initiat e whom we see redescend victorious from the summ it of Trials, in the fine allegor y of Cebes. The Grand Arcanum makes him master of gold and the light, which are at bottom the same thing, he has s olved the problem of the quadrature of the circle, he directs the perpetual movem ent, and he possesses the philosophical stone. Here the Adepts will understand us. There is neither interruption in the toil of nature, nor gap in her work. The Harmonies of Heaven correspond to those of Earth, and the Eternal Life accomplishes its evolutions in accordance with the same laws as the life of a dog. \" God has arranged all things b y weight, number, and measure,\" says the Bible; and this luminous doctrine was also that of Plato. Humani ty has never really had but one religion and one worship. This universal light has had its uncertain mirages, its deceitfu l reflections, and its shadow s; but alwa ys, after the nights of Error, we see it reappear, one and pure like the Sun.

Those oratories that resembl e poorly-furnished offices or inns, and those worthy ministers clad like notaries or lawy er's clerks, do the y not necessaril y cause religion to be regarded as a m ere puritanic formal ity, and God as a Justice of the Peace? We scoff at the Augurs. It is so easy to scoff, and so difficult well to compreh end. Did the Deity leave the whole world without Light for two score centuries, to illuminate only a little corner of Palestine and a brutal, ignorant, and ungrateful people? Why always calumniate God and the Sanctuar y? Were there never an y others than rogues among the priests? Could no honest and sincere men be found among the Hierophants of Ceres or Diana, of Dionu sos or Apollo, of Hermes or Mithras ? Were these, then, all deceived, like the rest? Who, then, constantl y deceived them, without betra ying themselves, during a series of centuries? – for the cheats are not immortal! Arago said, that outside of the pure mathematics, he who utters the word \"impossible,\" is wanting in prudence and good sense. The true na me of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatr y. For the Initiates, this is not a Person , but a Force , created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will . They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the m ythologic and horned form of the God PAN; thence came the he- goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light- bearer or Phosphor , of which the poets have mad e the false Lucifer of the legend. Gold, to the eyes of the Initiates, is Light condensed. They style the sacred numbers of the Kabalah \"golden numbers,\" and the moral teachings of Pythagoras his \"golden verses.\" For the same reason, a mysterious book of Apuleius, in which an ass figures largel y, was called \"The Golden As s.\" The Pagans accused the Christians of worshipping an ass, and they did not invent this reproach, but it came from the Samari tan Jews, who, figuring the data of the Kabalah in regard to the Divinit y by Egyptian symbols, also represented the Intelligenc e by the figure of the Magical Star adored under the name of Remphan , Science under the emblem of Anubis, who se name they changed to Nibbas , and the vulgar faith or credulit y under the figure of Thartac , a god represented with a book, a cloak, and the head of an ass. According to the Samarit an Doctors, Christianit y was the reign of Thartac , blind Faith and vulgar credulit y erected into a universal oracle, and preferred to Intelligenc e and Science. Synesius, Bishop of Ptolem aïs, a great Kabalist, but of doubtful orthodox y, wrote: \"The people will alwa ys mock at things eas y to be misunderstood; it must needs have impostur es.\" \"A Spirit,\" he said, \"that loves wisdom and contemp lates the Truth close at hand, is forced to disguise it, to induce the mul titudes to accept it... Fictions are necessar y to the people, and the Truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to conte mplate it in all its brilliance.

The truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperf ect reason.\" Moral disorder s produce physical ugliness, and in some sort realize those frightful faces which tradition assigns to the demons. The first Druids were the true children of the Magi, and their initiation came from Egypt and Chaldæa, that is to say, from the pure sources of the prim itive Kabalah. They adored the Trinity under the names of Isis or Hesus , the Supreme Harmon y; of Belen or Bel , which in Assyrian means Lord, a name corresponding to that of ADONAÏ; and of Camul or Camaël , a name that in the Kabalah personifies the Divine Ju stice. Below this triangle of Light they supposed a divine reflection, also composed of three personified rays: first, Teutates or Teuth , the same as the Thoth of the Eg yptians, the Word, or the Intelligenc e formulated; then Force and Beaut y, whose names varied like their emblems. Finally, they completed the sacred Septenar y by a mysterious image that represented the progress of the dogma and its future realiza tions. This was a y oung girl veiled, holding a child in her ar ms; and they dedicated this im age to \"The Virgin who will become a moth er; – Virgini parituræ .\" Hertha or Wertha, the young Isis of Gaul, Queen of Heaven, the Virgin who w as to bear a child, held the spindle of the Fates, filled with wool half white and half black; because she presides over all forms and all symbols, and weaves the garment of the Ideas. One of the most mysterious pantacles of the Kabalah, contained in the Enchiridion of Leo III., represents an equilatera l triangle reversed, inscribed in a double circle. On the triangle are written, in such manner as to form the prophetic Tau, the two Hebrew word s so often found appended to the Ineffable Name, אלהם and אות צב , ALOHAYIM, or the Powers, and TSABAOTH, or the starr y Armies and their guiding spirits; words also w hich symbolize the Equilibriu m of the Forces of Nature and the Harmon y of Numbers. To the three sides of the triangle belong the three great Names אדני יהוה, , and אגלא , IAHAVEH, A DONAÏ, and AGLA. Above the first is written in Latin, Formatio , above the second Reformatio , and above the third, Tran sformatio . So Creation is ascribed to the FATHER, Redemp tion or Reformat ion to the SON, and Sanctific ation or Transformat ion to the HOLY S PIRIT, answering unto the m athematical laws of Action, Reaction, and Equilibriu m. IAHAVEH is also, in effect, the Genesis or Format ion of dogma, by the elementary significat ion of the four letters of the Sacred Tetragram ; ADONAÏ is the realization of this dogma in the Human Form, in the Visible LORD, who is the Son of God or the perfect Man; and AGLA (formed of the initials of the four word s Ath Gebur Laulaïm Adonaï ) expresses the synthesis of the whole dogma and the totality of the Kabalistic science, clearly indicating by the hierogly phics of which this adm irable name is formed the Triple Secret of the Great Work. Masonry , like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermet icism and Alchem y, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its s ymbols to mislead those w ho deserve only to be misled ; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw the m away from it.

The true Mason is an ardent seeker after knowledge; and he knows that both books and the antique symbols of Masonry are vessels which co me down to us full- freighted with the intellec tual riches of the Past; and that in the lading of these argosies is much that sheds light on the history of Masonry, and proves its claim to be acknowledged the benefactor of mankind, born in the ver y cradle of the race. Knowledge is the most genuine and real of human treasures; for it is Light, as Ignorance is Darkness. It is the development of the human soul, and its acquisition the growth of the soul, which at the birth of man knows nothing, and therefore, in one sen se, may be said to be nothing. It is the seed, which has in it the power to grow, to acquire, and by acquiring to be developed, as the seed is developed into the shoot, the plant, the tree. \"We need not pause at the common argument that by learning man excelleth man, in that wherein man excelleth beasts; that by learning man ascendeth to the heavens and their motions, where in body he cannot com e, and the like. Let us rather regard the dignit y and excellenc y of knowledge and learning in that whereunto man's nature doth most aspire, which is immortality or continuance. For to this tendeth generation, and raising of Houses and Families; to this buildings, foundations, and monu ments; to this tendeth the desire of memory, fame, and celebrat ion, and in effect the strength of all other human desires.\" That our influences shall survive us, and be living forces when we are in our graves; and not merely that our nam es shall be remembered; but rather that our works shall be read, our acts spoken of, our names recollec ted and. mention ed when we are dead, as evidences that those influences live and rule, sway and control some portion of mankind and of the world, – this is the aspiration of the human soul. \"We see then how far the monu ments of genius and learning are more durable than monu ments of power or of the hands. F or have not the verses of Homer continued twenty -five hundred ye ars or more, without the loss of a syllable or letter, during which time infinite palaces, temples, castles, cities, have decayed and been demol ished? It is not pos sible to have the true pictures or statues of Cyrus, Alexander, Cæsar, no, nor of the Kings or great personages of much later years; for the originals cannot last, and the copies cannot but lose of the life and truth. But the images of men's genius and knowledge remain in books, exempted from the wrong of ti me, and capable of perpetual renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called images, because they generate still, and cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages; so that if the invention of the ship wa s thought so noble, which carrieth riches and com modities from place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions in particip ation of their fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified, which, as ships, pas s through the vast seas of ti me, and make ages so distant to particip ate of the wisdom, illumination, and inventions, the one of the other.\" To learn, to attain knowledge, to be wise, is a necessity for ever y truly noble soul; to teach, to communicate that knowledge, to share that wisdom with others, and not churlishl y to lock up his exchequer, and place a sentinel at the door to drive away the need y, is equall y an impulse of a noble nature, and the worthiest work of man.

Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. Then, said I, wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his word s are not heard.\" If it should chance to you, my brother, to do mankind good service, and be rewarded with indifference and forgetfulness onl y, still be not discouraged, but reme mber the further advice of the wise King. \"In the morning sow the seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, this or that, or whether both shall be alike good.\" Sow yo u the seed, whoever reaps. Learn, that you may be enabled to do good; and do so because it is right, finding in the act itself ample. reward and reco mpense. To attain the truth, and to serve our fellows, our countr y, and mank ind – this is the noblest destiny of man. Hereafter and all your life it is to be your object. If you desire to ascend to that destiny, advance! If you have other and less noble objects, and are contented with a lower flight, halt here! let others scale the heights, and Masonry fulfill her mission. If you will advance, gird up y our loins for the struggle! for the wa y is long and toilsom e. Pleasure, all smiles, will beckon y ou on the one hand, and Indolence will invite you to sleep among the flowers, upon the other. Prepare, by secrecy, obedience, and fidelit y, to resist the allure ments of both! Secrecy is indispensable in a Mason of whatever Degree. It is the first and almost the onl y lesson taught to the Entered Apprentice. The obligations which we have each assumed toward every Mason that lives, requiring of us the perform ance of the most serious and onerous duties toward those personall y unknown to us until they demand our aid, – duties that must be performed, even at the risk of life, or our solemn oaths be broken and violated, and we be branded as false Mason s and faithless m en, teach us how profound a folly it would he to betra y our secrets to those who, bound to us by no tie of comm on obligation, might, by obtaining them, call on us in their extremity, when the urgenc y of the occasion should allow us no time for inquiry , and the peremp tory mandate of our obligation compe l us to do a brother's dut y to a base impostor. The secrets of our brother, when comm unicated to us, must be sacred, if the y be such as the law of our countr y warrants us to keep. We are required to keep none other, when the law that we are called on to obey is indeed a law, b y having emanated from the onl y source of power, the People. Edicts which emanat e from the mere arbitrar y will of a despotic power, contrar y to the law of God or the Great Law of Nature, destructive of the inherent rights of man, violativ e of the right of free thought, free speech, free conscience, it is lawful to rebel against and strive to abrogate. For obedience to the Law does not mean submission to tyranny; nor that, by a profligate sacrifice of every noble feeling, we should offer to despotism the homage of adulation. As every new victim falls, we may lift our voice in still louder flatter y. We ma y fall at the proud feet, we may beg, as a boon, the honor of kis sing that bloody hand which has been lifted against the helpless. We may do more: we may bring the altar and the sacrifice, and implore the God not to ascend too soon to Heaven. This we ma y do, for this we have the sad rem embrance that beings of a human form and soul have done. But this is all we can Page 81 of 621"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike do. We can constrain our tongues to be false, our features to bend themselv es to the semblance of that passionate adoration which we wish to express, our knees to fall prostrate; but our heart we cannot constrain. There virtue must still have a voice which is not to be drowned b y hymns and accla mations; there the crimes which we laud as virtues, are crimes still, and he whom we have made a God is the most contemptible of mankind; if, indeed, we do not feel, perhaps, that we are ourselves still more contemp tible. But that law which is the fair expression of the will and judgmen t of the people, is the enactment of the whole and of ever y individual. Consistent with the law of God and the great law of nature, consistent with pure and abstract right as tempered by necessit y and the general interest, as contra- distinguished from the private interest of individuals, it is obligator y upon all, because it is the work of all, the will of all, the solemn judgment of all, from which there is no appeal. In this Degree, m y brother, you are especial ly to learn the duty of obedience to that law. There is one true and original law, conformabl e to reason and to nature, diffused over all, invariabl e, eternal, which calls to the fulfill ment of duty , and to abstinence from injustice, and calls with that irresistible voice which is felt in all its authorit y wherever it is heard. This law cannot be abrogated or diminished, or its sanctions affected, by any law of man. A whole senate, a whole people, cannot dissent from its paramoun t obligation. It requires no com mentator to render it distinctl y intelligible: nor is it one thing at Rome, another at Athens; one thing now, and another in the ages to come; but in all times and in all nations, it is, and has been, and will be, one and everlasting ; – one as that God, its great Author and Promulga tor, who is the Comm on Sovereign of all mankind, is Himself One. No man can disobey it without flying, as it were, from his own bosom, and repudiating his nature; and in this very act he will inflict on himself the severest of retribut ions, even though he escape what is regarded as punishmen t. It is our duty to obey the laws of our countr y, and to be careful that prejudice or passion, fancy or affection, error and illusion, be not mist aken for conscience. Nothing is more usual than to pretend conscience in all the actions of man which are public and cannot be concealed. The disobedient refuse to submit to the laws, and they also in man y cases pretend conscience; and so disobedience and rebellion become conscience, in which there is neither knowledge nor revelation, nor truth nor charit y, nor reason nor religion. Conscience is tied to laws. Right or sure conscience is right reason reduced to practice, and conducting moral actions, while perverse conscience is seated in the fanc y or affections – a heap of irregular principles and irregular defects – and is the same in conscience as deformity is in the bod y, or peevishness in the affections. It is not enough that the conscience be taught by nature; but it must be taught by God, conducted by reason, mad e operative by discourse, as sisted by choice, instructed by laws and sober principles; and then it is right, and it may be sure. All the general measures of justice, are the laws of God, and therefore they constitute the general rules of government for the conscience; but necessit y also hath a large voice in the arrangem ent of human affairs, and the disposal of human relations, and the dispositions of human laws; and these general measures, like a great river into litt le streams, are deduced into little rivulets and particulari ties, by the laws and customs, by the sentences and agree ments of men, and by the absolute despotism of necessit y, that will not allow perfect and abstract justice and equit y to be the sole rule of Page 82 of 621"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike civil government in an imp erfect world; and that must needs be law which is for the greatest good of the greatest number. When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it. It is better thou shouldest not vow than thou shouldest vow and not pay. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in Heaven, and thou art upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. Weigh well what it is you promise; but once the promise and pledge are given rem ember that he who is false to his obligat ion will be false to his fami ly, his friends, his country , and his God. Fides servanda est : Faith plighted is ever to be kept, was a maxim and an axio m even among pagans. The virtuous Roman said, either let not that which seems expedient be base, or if it be base, let it not seem expedient. What is there which that so-called expedienc y can bring, so valuable as that which it takes away, if it deprives y ou of the name of a good man and robs yo u of your integrit y and honor? In all ages, he who violates his plighted word has been held unspeakabl y base. The word of a Mason, like the word of a knight in the times of chivalr y, once given must be sacred; and the judgment of his brothers, upon him who violates his pledge, should be stern as the judgmen ts of the Roman Censors against him who violated his oath. Good faith is revered a mong Mason s as it was among the Rom ans, who placed its statue in the capitol, next to that of Jupiter Maxi mus Optimus; and we, like them, hold that calamity should alwa ys be chosen rather than baseness; and with the knights of old, that one should alwa ys die rather than be dishonored. Be faithful, therefore, to the promises you make, to the pledges y ou give, and to the vows that you assume, since to break either is base and dishonorable. Be faithful to your family, and perform all the duties of a good father, a good son, a good husband, and a good brother. Be faithful to your friends; for true friendship is of a nature not onl y to survive through all the vicissitudes of life, but to continue through an endless duration; not only to stand the shock of conflict ing opinions, and the roar of a revolution that shakes the world, but to last when the heavens are no more, and to spring fresh from the ruins of the universe. Be faithful to your country, and prefer its dignity and honor to an y degree of popularit y and honor for yo urself; consulting its interest rather than your own, and rather than the pleasure and gratific ation of the people, which are often at variance with their welfare. Be faithful to Masonry , which is to be faithful to the best interests of mankind.

Masonry is useful to all men: to the learned, because it affords them the opportunit y of exercising their talents upon subjects emin ently worthy of their attention; to the illiterate, because it offers them importan t instruction; to the young, because it presents them with salutary precepts and good examp les, and accusto ms them to reflect on the proper mode of living; to the man of the world, whom it furnishes with noble and useful recreation; to the traveller, whom it enables to find friends and brothers in countries where else he would be Page 83 of 621"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike isolated and solitary; to the worthy man in misfortune, to whom it gives assistance; to the afflicted, on whom it lavishes consolation; to the charitable man, whom it enables to do more good, by uniting with those who are charitable like himself; and to all who have souls capable of appreciating its import ance, and of enjoy ing the char ms of a friendship founded on the same principles of religion, morality, and philanthrop y. A Freemason, therefore, should be a man of honor and of conscience, preferring his duty to everything beside, even to his life; independent in his opinions, and of good mora ls; submissive to the laws, devoted to humanit y, to his countr y, to his fami ly; kind and indulgent to his brethren, friend of all virtuous men, and read y to assist his fellows b y all means in his power. Thus will you be faithful to yourself, to your fellows, and to God, and thus will you do honor to the nam e and rank of SECRET MA STER; which, like other Masonic honors, degrades if it is not deserved.

What he was employed to do ū ū he did diligently, and he did it well and faithfully. He received no wages that were not his due . Industry and honesty are the virtues peculiarl y inculcated in this Degree. They are common and hom ely virtues; but not for that beneath our notice. As the bees do not love or respect the drones, s o Masonry neither loves nor respects the idle and those who live by their wits; and least of all those parasitic acari that live upon the mselves. For those who are indolent are likel y to become dissipated and vicious; and perfect honesty , which ought to be the com mon qualifica tion of all, is more rare than diamonds. To do earnestl y and steadily, and to do faithfull y and honestly that which we have to do – perhaps this wants but little, when looked at from every point of view, of including the whole bod y of the moral law; and even in their commonest and home liest application, these virtues belong to the character of a Perfect Master. Idleness is the burial of a living man. For an idle person is s o useless to an y purposes of God and man, that he is like one who is dead, unconcerned in the changes and necessities of the world; and he only lives to spend his tim e, and eat the fruits of the earth. Like a vermin or a wolf, when his ti me comes, he dies and perishes, and in the me antime is nought. He neither ploughs nor carries burdens: all that he does is either unprofitable or mischievous. It is a vast work that any man may do, if he never be idle: and it is a huge wa y that a man may go in virtue, if he never go out of his w ay by a vicious habit or a great crime: and he who perpetuall y reads good books, if his parts be answerable, will have a huge stock of knowledge. St. Ambrose, and from his examp le, St. Augustine, divided every day into these tertias of employment: eight hours the y spent in the necessities of nature and recreation: eight hours in charity, in doing assistance to others, dispatching their business, reconcil ing their enmities, reproving their vices, correcting their errors, instructing their ignorance, and in transacting the affairs of their dioceses; and the other eight hours they spent in study and prayer. We think, at the age of twent y, that life is much too long for that which we have to learn and do; and that there is an al most fabulous distance between our age and that of our grandfather. But when, at the age of sixt y, if we are fortunate enough to reach it, or Page 85 of 621"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike unfortunate enough, as the case may be, and according as we have profitabl y invested or wasted our ti me, we halt, and look back along the way we have come, and cast up and endeavor to balance our accounts with time and opportunit y, we find that we have made life much too short, and thrown awa y a huge portion of our time. Then we, in our mind, deduct from the sum total of our y ears the hours that we have needlessl y passed in sleep; the working-hours each da y, during which the surface of the mind's sluggish pool has not been stirred or ruffled by a single thought; the days that we have gladly got rid of, to attain some real or fancied object that lay beyond, in the wa y between us and which stood irksome ly the intervening days; the hours w orse than wasted in follies and dissipation, or misspent in useless and unprofitable studies; and we acknowledge, with a sigh, that we could have learned and done, in half a score of y ears well spent, more than we have done in all our forty years of manhood. To learn and to do! – this is the soul's work here below. The soul grows a s truly as an oak grows. A s the tree takes the carbon of the air, the dew, the rain, and the light, and the food that the earth supplies to its roots, and by its mysterious chemistr y trans-mut es them into sap and fibre, into wood and leaf, and flower and fruit, and color and perfume, so the soul imbibes knowledge and by a divine alchemy changes what it learns into its own sub stance, and grows from within outwardly with an inherent force and power like those that lie hidden in the grain of wheat. The soul hath its senses, like the body, that may be cultivated, enlarged, refined, as itself grows in stature and proportion; and he who cannot appreciate a fine painting or statue, a noble poem, a sweet harmon y, a heroic thought, or a disinterested action, or to whom the wisdom of philosoph y is but foolishness and babble, and the loftiest truths of less importance than the price of stocks or cotton, or the elevat ion of baseness to office, merely lives on the level of comm onplace, and fitl y prides himse lf upon that inferiorit y of the soul's senses, which is the inferiorit y and imperfe ct develop ment of the soul itself. To sleep littl e, and to study much; to say little, and to hear and think much; to learn, that we may be able to do, and then to do, earnestl y and vigorously , whatever may be required of us by duty, and by the good of our fellows, our countr y, and mank ind, – these are the duties of every Maso n who desires to imitate the Master Kh r m. ū ū The duty of a Mason as an honest m an is plain and eas y. It requires of us honesty in contracts, sincerit y in affirm ing, simplicity in bargaining, and faithfulness in performing. Lie not at all, neither in a little thing nor in a great, neither in the substance nor in the circumstance, neither in word nor deed: that is, pretend not what is false; cover not what is true; and let the measure of your affirma tion or denial be the understanding of your con- tractor; for he who deceives the buyer or the seller by speaking what is true, in a sense not intended or understood by the other, is a liar and a thief. A Perfect Master must avoid that which deceives, equally with that which is false. Let your prices be according to that measure of good and evil which is established in the fame and com mon accounts of the wisest and most merciful men, skilled in that manufacture or com modity; and the gain such, which, without scandal, is allowed to persons in all the same circumstances.

Let no man, for his o wn povert y, becom e more oppres sing and cruel in his bargain; but quietly, modestl y, diligen tly, and patientl y recommend his estate to God, and follow his interest, and leave the success to Him. Detain not the wages of the hireling ; for ever y degree of detention of it be yond the time, is injustice and uncharitabl eness, and grinds his face till tears and blood come out; but pay him exactly according to covenant, or according to his needs. Religiousl y keep all promises and covenants, though made to your disadvantage, though afterward you perceive you might have done better; and let not any precedent act of yours be altered by any after-accident. Let nothing mak e you break your promise, unless it be unlawful or impossible ; that is, either out of your nature or out of your civil power, yourself being under the power of another; or that it be intolerabl y inconvenient to yourself, and of no advantage to another; or that you have leave expressed or reasonabl y presumed. Let no man take wages or fees for a work that he cannot do, or cannot with probabilit y undertake; or in some sense profitabl y, and with ease, or with advantage manag e. Let no man appropriate to his own use, what God, b y a special mercy, or the Republic, hath made common; for that is against both Justice and Charit y. That any man should be the worse for us, and for our direct act, and by our intention, is against the rule of equit y, of justice, and of charit y. We then do not that to others, which we would have done to ourselves; for we gro w richer upon the ruins of their fortune. It is not honest to receive anything from another without returning him an equivalen t therefor. The gamester who wins the money of another is dishonest. There should be no such thing as bets and gam ing among Masons: for no honest man should desire that for nothing which belongs to another. The mer chant who sells an inferior article for a sound price, the speculator who makes the distresses and needs of others fill his exchequer are neither fair nor honest, but base, ignoble, unfit for i mmortality. It should be the earnest desire of every Perfect Master so to live and deal and act, that when it comes to him to die, he may be able to say, and his conscience to adjudge, that no man on earth is poorer, because he is richer; that what he hath he has honestl y earned, and no man can go before God, and claim that by the rules of equit y administered in His great chancer y, this house in which we die, this land we devise to our heirs, this mone y that enriches those who survive to bear our name, is his and not ours, and we in that forum are only his trustees. For it is most certain that God is j ust, and will sternly enforce ever y such trust; and that to all whom we despoil, to all whom we defraud, to all from whom we take or win an ything whatever, without fair consideration and equivalent, He will decree a full and adequate compensat ion.

[Con fidential Secretary.] You are especial ly taught in this Degree to be zealous and faithful; to be disinterested and benevolent ; and to act the peace-maker, in case of dissensions, disputes, and quarrels among the brethren. Duty is the moral magnet ism which controls and guides the true Mason's course over the tumultuous seas of life. Whether the stars of honor, reputation, and reward do or do not shine, in the light of day or in the darknes s of the night of trouble and adversit y, in calm or storm, that unerring magne t still shows him the true course to steer, and indicat es with certainty where-awa y lies the port which not to reach involves shipwreck and dishonor.

To perform that duty, whether the perform ance be rewarded or unrewarded, is his s ole care. And it doth not matter, though of this performance there may be no witnesse s, and though what he does will be forever unknown to all mankind. A little consideration will teach us that Fame has other limits than mountains and oceans; and that he who places happiness in the frequent repetition of his name, may spend his life in propagating it, without any danger of weeping for new worlds, or necessit y of passing the Atlantic sea. If, therefore, he who imagines the world to be filled with his actions and praises, shall subduct from the numb er of his encom iasts all those who are placed below the flight of fame, and who hear in the valle y of life no voice but that of necessity ; all those who imagine themselv es too impor tant to regard him, and consider the mention of his name as a usurpation of their time; all who are too much or too little pleased with themselv es to attend to anything external; all who are attracted by pleasure, or chained down b y pain to unvaried ideas; all who are withheld from attending his triumph by different pursuits; and all who slumber in universal negligence; he will find his renown straitened by nearer bounds than the rocks of Caucasus; and perceive that no man can be venerable or Page 89 of 621"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike formidable, but to a small part of his fellow- creatures. And therefore, that we ma y not languish in our endeavors after excell ence, it is necessar y that, as Africanus counsels his descendants, we raise our e yes to higher prospects, and contem plate our future and eternal state, without giving up our hearts to the praise of crowds, or fixing our hopes on s uch rewards as human power can bestow. We are not born for our selves alone; and our countr y claims her share, and our friends their share of us. As all that the earth produces is created for the use of man, so men are created for the sake of men, that they may mutual ly do good to one another. In this we ought to take nature for our guide, and throw into the public stock the offices of general utility, by a reciprocat ion of duties; sometimes by receiving, sometimes by giving, and someti mes to cement human society by arts, by industr y, and by our resources. Suffer others to be praised in thy presence, and entertain their good and glor y with delight; but at no hand disparage them, or lessen the report, or m ake an objection; and think not the advance ment of thy brother is a lessening of thy worth. Upbraid no m an's weakness to hi m to discomfit him, neither report it to disparage him, neither delight to remember it to lessen him, or to set thyself above him; nor ever praise thyself or dispraise any man else, unless some sufficient worthy end do hallow it. Remember that we usually disparage others upon slight ground s and little instances; and if a man be highl y commended, we think him sufficient ly lessened, if we can but charge one sin of foll y or inferiorit y in his account. We should either be more severe to ourselves, or less so to others, and consider that whatsoever good any one can think or sa y of us, we can tell him of man y unworthy and foolish and perhaps w orse actions of ours, any one of which, done by another, would be enough, with us, to destro y his reputation. If we think the people wise and sagacious, and just and appreciative, when they praise and make idols of us, let us not call them unlearned and ignorant, and ill and stupid judge s, when our neighbor is cried up by public fame and popular noises. Every man hath in his own life sins enough, in his own mind trouble enough, in his own fortunes evil enough, and in perform ance of his offices failings more than enough, to entertain his own inquiry ; so that curiosit y after the affairs of others cannot be without envy and an ill mind. The generous m an will be solicitous and inquisitive into the beauty and order of a well- governed fam ily, and after the virtues of an excellent person; but anything for which m en keep locks and bars, or that blushes to see the light, or that is either shamefu l in manner or private in nature, this thing will not be his care and business. It should be objection sufficient to exclude any man from the society of Masons, that he is not disinterested and generous, both in his acts, and in his opinions of men, and his constructions of their conduct. He who is selfish and grasping, or censorious and ungenerous, will not long remain within the strict limits of honest y and truth, but will shortly commit injustice. He who loves himself too much must needs love others too little ; and he who habitual ly gives harsh judgment will not long dela y to give unjust judgment. The generous man is not careful to return no more than he receives; but prefers that the balances upon the ledgers of benefits shall be in his favor. He who hath received pay in full Page 90 of 621"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike for all the benefits and favors that he has conferred, is like a spendthrift who has consumed his whole estate, and lam ents over an empty exchequer. He who requites my favors with ingratitud e adds to, instead of diminishing, my wealth; and he who cannot return a favor is equally poor, whether his inabilit y arises from poverty of spirit, sordidness of soul, or pecuniar y indigence. If he is wealthy who hath large sums invested, and the mass of whose fortune consists in obligations that bind other men to pay him money, he is still more so to whom many owe large returns of kindnesses and favors. Be yond a modera te sum each year, the wealth y man merely invests his means: and that which he never uses is still like favors unreturned and kindnesses unreciprocat ed, an actual and real portion of his fortune. Generosit y and a liberal spirit make men to be hum ane and genial, open-hearted, frank, and sincere, earnest to do good, eas y and contented, and well- wishers of mank ind. They protect the feeble against the strong, and the defenceless against rapacit y and craft. The y succor and comfort the poor, and are the guardians, under God, of his innocent and helpless wards. They value friends more than riches or fam e, and gratitude more than money or power. The y are noble by God's patent, and their escutcheons and quarterings are to be found in heaven's great book of heraldr y. Nor can an y man any more be a Mason than he can be a gentle- man, unless he is generous, liberal, and disinterested. To be liberal, but only of that which is our o wn; to be generous, but only when we have first been ju st; to give, when to give deprives us of a luxur y or a comfort, this is Masonry indeed. He who is worldly , covetous, or sensual must change before he can be a good Ma son. If we are governed b y inclina tion and not by duty; if we are unkind, severe, censorious, or injurious, in the relations or intercourse of life; if we are unfaithful parents or undutiful children; if we are harsh masters or faithless servants; if we are treacherous friends or bad neighbors or bitter compet itors or corrupt unprincipled politicians or overreaching dealers in business, we are wandering at a great distance from the true Masonic light. Masons must be kind and affectionate one to another. Frequenting the same temples, kneeling at the same altars, they should feel that respect and that kindness for each other, which their co mmon relation and com mon approach to one God should inspire. There needs to be much more of the spirit of the ancient fellow- ship among us; more tenderness for each other's faults, mor e forgiveness, more solicitude for each other's improve ment and good fortune; somewhat of brotherl y feeling, that it be not shame to use the word \" brother .\" Nothing should be allowed to interfere with that kindness and affection: neither the spirit of business, absorbing, eager, and overreaching, ungenerous and hard in its dealings, keen and bitter in its co mpetitions, low and sordid in its purposes; nor that of ambi tion, selfish, mercenary, restless, circumv enting, living only in the opinion of others, envious of the good fortune of others, miserab ly vain of its own success, un just, unscrupulous, and slanderous. He that does me a favor, hath bound me to make him a return of thankfulness. The obligation comes not by covenant, nor by his own express intention ; but by the nature of the thing; and is a dut y springing up within the spirit of the obliged person, to whom it is Page 91 of 621"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike more natural to love his friend, and to do good for good, than to return evil for evil; because a man may forgive an injury , but he must never forget. a good turn. He that refuses to do good to them whom he is bound to love, or to love that which did hi m good, is unnatural and monstrous in his affections, and thinks all the world born to minister to him; with a greediness worse than that of the sea, which, although it receives all rivers into itself, yet it furnishes the clouds and springs with a return of all they need . Our duty to those who are our benefactors is, to esteem and love their person s, to make them proportionable returns of service, or duty , or profit, according as we can, or as the y need, or as opportunit y presents itself; and according to the greatness of their kindnesses. The generous man cannot but regret to see dissensions and disputes among his brethren. Only the base and ungenerous delight in discord. It is the poorest occupation of humani ty to labor to make men think worse of each other, as the press, and too com monly the pulpit, changing places with the hustings and the tribune, do. The dut y of the Mason is to endeavor to mak e man think better of his neighbor; to quiet, instead of aggravating difficult ies; to bring together those who are severed or estranged; to keep friends from becoming foes, and to persuade foes to become friends. To do this, he must needs control his own passions, and be not rash and hasty, nor swift to take offence, nor easy to be angered. For anger is a profes sed enemy to counsel. It is a direct storm, in which no man can be heard to speak or call from without; for if y ou counsel gently, you are disregarded; if you urge it and be vehemen t, you provoke it more. It is neither manly nor ingenuous. It makes marriage to be a necessary and unavoidable trouble; friendships and societies and familiarities, to be intolerable. It multiplies the evils of drunkenness, and mak es the leviti es of wine to run into madness. It makes innocent jesting to be the beginning of tragedies. It terns friendship into hatred; it makes a man lose himse lf, and his reason and his argument, in disputation. It turns the desires of knowledge into an itch of wrangling. It adds insolenc y to power. It turns j ustice into cruelty, and judgment into oppression. It changes discipline into tediousness and hatred of liberal institution. It makes a prosperous man to be envied, and the unfortunate to be unpitied. See, therefore, that first controlling your own te mper, and governing y our own pas sions, you fit yourself to keep peace and harmon y among other men, and especiall y the brethren. Above all remember that Masonr y is the realm of peace, and that \" among Masons there must be no dissension, but only that noble emulation, which can best work and best agree .\" Wherever there is strife and hatred among the brethren, there is no Ma sonry; for Masonry is Peace, and Brotherl y Love, and Concord. Masonry is the great Peace Society of the world. Wherever it exists, it struggles to prevent internat ional difficulties and disputes; and to bind Republics, Kingdoms, and Empires together in one great band of peace and am ity. It would not so often struggle in vain, if Masons kne w their power and valued their oaths. Who can sum up the horrors and woes accu mulated in a single war? Masonry is not dazzled with all its pomp and circumst ance, all its glitter and glory . War conies with its bloody hand into our very dwellings. It takes from ten thousand homes those who lived there in peace and comfort, held by the tender ties of fam ily and kindred. It drags them Page 92 of 621"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike away, to die untended, of fever or exposure, in infectious climes; or to be hacked, torn, and mangled in the fierce fight; to fall on the gor y field, to rise no more, or to be borne awa y, in awful agony , to noisom e and horrid hospitals. The groans of the battle- field are echoed in sighs of bereave ment from thousand s of desolated hearths. There is a skeleton in ever y house, a vacant chair at every table. Returning, the soldier brings w orse sorrow to his home, by the infection which he has caught, of camp-vices. The countr y is demoral ized. The national mind is brought down, from the noble interchange of kind offices with another people, to wrath and revenge, and base pride, and the habit of measuring brute strength against brute strength, in battle. Treasures are expended, that would suffice to build ten thousand churches, hospitals, and universities, or rib and tie together a continent with rails of iron. If that treasure were sunk in the sea, it would be cala mity enough; but it is put to worse use; for it is expended in cutting into the veins and arteries of human life, until the earth is deluged with a sea of blood. Such are the lessons of this Degree. You have vowed to make them the rule, the law, and the guide of y our life and conduct. If y ou do so, y ou will be entitled, because fitted, to advance in Masonry. If you do not, you have alread y gone too far. Page 93 of 621"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike VII — PROVOST AND JUDGE. VII — PROVOST AND JUDGE. THE lesson w hich this Degree inculcates is JUSTICE, in decision and judgment, and in our intercourse and dealing with other men. In a country where trial by jury is known, every intellig ent man is liable to be called on to act as a judge, either of fact alone, or of fact and law ming led; and to assume the heavy responsibiliti es which belong to that character. Those who are invested with the power of judgment should judge the causes of all person s uprightl y and impartially, without any personal consideration of the power of the mighty, or the bribe of the rich, or the needs of the poor. That is the cardinal rule, which no one will dispute; though man y fail to observe it. But the y must do more. They must divest themselves of prejudice and preconception. They must hear patientl y, remember accurate ly, and weigh carefull y the facts and the argumen ts offered before them. They must not leap hastily to conclusions, nor form opinions before they have heard all. They must not presume crime or fraud. They must neither be ruled by stubborn pride of opinion, nor be too facile and yielding to the views and argumen ts of others. In deducing the mo tive from the proven act, they must not assign to the act either the best or the worst mo tives, but those which they would think it just and fair for the world to assign to it, if they themselv es had done if; nor must they endeavor to make many little circumst ances, that weigh nothing separatel y, weigh much together, to prove their own acuteness and sagacit y. These are sound rules for ever y juror, also, to observe. In our intercourse with others, there are two kinds of injustice: the first, of those who offer an injury; the second, of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and yet do it not. So active injustice may be done in two way s – by force and by fraud, – of which force is lion- like, and fraud fox-like, – both utterl y repugnant to social duty, but fraud the more detestabl e. Every wrong done by one man to another, whether it affect his person, his propert y, his happiness, or his reputation, is an offense against the law of ju stice. The field of this Degree is therefore a wide and vast one; and Masonry seeks for the most impressive mode Page 94 of 621"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike of enforcing the law of j ustice, and the most effectual means of preventing wrong and injustice. To this end it teaches this great and mo mentous truth: that wrong and inju stice once done cannot be undone; but are eternal in their consequences; once committed, are numbered with the irrevocable Past; that the wrong that is done contains its own retributiv e penalty as surely and as naturall y as the acorn contains the oak. Its consequences are its punishmen t; it needs no other, and can have no heavier; they are involved in its com mission, and cannot be separated from it. A wrong done to another is an injury done to our own Nature, an offence against our own s ouls, a disfiguring of the image of the Beautiful and Good. Punishment is not the execution of a sentence, but the occurrence of an effect. It is ordained to follow guilt, not by the decree of God as a judge, but b y a law enacted by Him as the Creator and Legislator of the Universe. It is not an arbitrar y and artific ial annexation, but an ordinar y and logical consequence; and therefore must be borne b y the wrong-doer, and through him may flow on to others. It is the decision of the infinite justice of God, in the form of law. There can be no interference with, or rem ittance of, or protection from, the natural effects of our wrongful acts. God will not interpose between the cause and its consequence; and in that sense there can be no forgiveness of sin s. The act which has debased our soul m ay be repented of, may be turned from; but the injur y is done. The debasemen t may be redee med by after-efforts, the stain obliterated by bitterer struggles and severer sufferings; but the efforts and the endurance which might have raised the soul to the loftiest heights are now exhausted in merely regaining what it has lost. There must always be a wide difference between him who only ceases to do evil, and him who has alway s done well. He will certainl y be a far more scrupulous watcher over his conduct, and far more careful of his deeds, who believes that those deeds will inevitab ly bear their natural consequences, exempt from after intervention, than he who believes that penitence and par-don will at any time unlink the chain of sequences. Surely we shall do less w rong and injustice, if the conviction is fixed and embedded in our souls that everything done is done irrevocabl y, that even the Omnipot ence of God cannot uncommit a deed, cannot mak e that undone which has been done ; that every act of ours must bear its allotted fruit, according to the everlasting laws, – must remain forever ineffaceabl y inscribed on the tablets of Universal Nature. If you have wronged another, you may grieve, repent, and resolutel y determine against any such weakness in future. You ma y, so far as it is possible, make reparation. It is well. The injured part y may forgive you, according to the meaning of human language; but the deed is done ; and all the powers of Nature, were the y to conspire in your behalf, could not make it undone ; the consequences to the body, the consequences to the soul, though no man may perceive them, are there , are written in the annals of the Past, and must reverbrate throughout all time. Repentance for a wrong done, bears, like every other act, its own fruit, the fruit of purifying the heart and amending the Future, but not of effacing the Past. The commission of the wrong is an irrevocable act; but it does not incapacit ate the soul to do right for the future. Its consequences cannot be expunged; but its course need not be pursued. Wrong Page 95 of 621"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and evil perpetrat ed, though inefface able, call for no despair, but for efforts more energeti c than before. Repentance is still as valid as ever; but it is valid to secure the Future, not to oblitera te the Past. Even the pulsations of the air, once set in mot ion by the human voice, cease not to exist with the sounds to which the y gave rise. Their quickly-attenuated force soon beco mes inaudible to human ears. But the waves of air thus raised perambul ate the surface of earth and ocean, and in less than twent y hours, every atom of the atmosphere takes up the altered movement due to that infinitesi mal portion of pri mitive motion which has been conve yed to it through countless channels, and which must continue to influence its path throughout its future existence. The air is one vast librar y, on who se pages is forever written all that man has ever said or even whispered. There, in their mutable, but unerring characters, mixed with the earliest, as well as the latest signs of mor tality, stand forever recorded, vows unredeemed, promises unfulfilled ; perpetuating, in the movem ents of each particle, all in unison, the testi mony of man's changeful will. God reads that book, though we cannot. So earth, air, and ocean are the eternal witnesses of the acts that we have done. No mot ion impressed by natural causes or b y human agency is ever obliterated. The track of ever y keel which has ever disturbed the surface of the ocean remains forever registered in the future movem ents of all succeeding particles which may occupy its place. Every criminal is by the laws of the Alm ighty irrevocabl y chained to the testimony of his crim e; for every atom of his mort al frame, through whatever changes its particles may migrate, will still retain, adhering to it through every combination, some movement derived from that very muscular effort by which the crime itself was perpetrated. What if our faculti es should be so enhanced in a future life as to enable us to perceive and trace the ineffaceabl e consequences of our idle words and evil deeds, and render our remorse and grief as eternal as those consequences themselv es? No more fearful punishmen t to a superior intellig ence can be conceived, than to see still in action, with the consciousness that it must continue in action forever, a cause of wrong put in motion by itself ages before. Masonry , by its teachings, endeavors to restrain men from the com mission of injustice and acts of wrong and outrage. Though it does not endeavor to usurp the place of religion, still its code of mora ls proceeds upon other principles than the municipal law; and it conde mns and punishe s offences which neither that law punishes nor public opinion condemns. In the Masonic law, to cheat and overreach in trade, at the bar, in politics, are deem ed no more venial than theft; nor a deliberate lie than perjury ; nor slander than robbery; nor seduction than murder. Especial ly it condemns those wrongs of w hich the doer induces another to partake. He may repent; he may, after agonizing struggles, regain the path of virtue; his spirit may reachieve its purity through much anguish, after many strifes; but the weaker fellow-creature whom he led astra y, whom he made a sharer in his guilt, but whom he cannot make a sharer in his repentance and amend ment, whose downward course (the first step of which he taught) he cannot check, but is comp elled to witness, – what forgiveness of sins can avail him there? Page 96 of 621"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike There is his perpetual, his inevitable punishment, which no repentance can allevia te, and no mercy can remit. Let us be ju st, also, in judging of other men's motives. We know but little of the real merits or demerits of any fellow-creature. We can rarely say with certaint y that this man is more guilty than that, or even that this man is very good or ver y wicked. Often the basest men leave behind them excellent reputations. There is scarcel y one of us w ho has not, at some time in his life, been on the edge of the commission of a cri me. Every one of us can look back, and shuddering see the time when our feet stood upon the slippery crags that overhung the abyss of guilt; and when, if temptation had been a little more urgent, or a little longer continued, if penur y had pres sed us a little harder, or a littl e more wine had further disturbed our intel lect, dethroned our judgment, and aroused our passions, our feet would have slipped, and we should have fallen, never to rise again. We may be able to say – \" This man has lied, has pilfered, has forged, has emb ezzled moneys intrusted to him; and that man has gone through life with clean hands.\" But we cannot say that the former has not struggled long, though unsuccessfull y, against temptations under which the second would have succumbed without an effort. We can say which has the cleanest hands before man ; but not which has the cleanest soul before God . We may be able to say, this man has comm itted adulter y, and that man has been ever chaste; but we cannot tell but that the innocence of one ma y have been due to the coldness of his heart, to the absence of a motiv e, to the presence of a fear, to the slight degree of the temptation; nor but that the fall of the other may have been preceded by the most vehement self-contest, caused by the most over-master ing frenzy, and atoned for by the most hallowing repentance. Generosity as well as niggardliness may be a mere yielding to native temperament; and in the eye of Heaven, a long life of beneficence in one man may have cost less effort, and ma y indicate less virtue and less sacrifice of interest, than a few rare hidden acts of kindness wrung by duty out of the reluctant and unsy mpathizing nature of the other. There may be more real merit, more self-sacrificing effort, more of the noblest elements of moral grandeur, in a life of failure, sin, and shame, than in a career, to our eyes, of stainless integrit y. When we condemn or pity the fallen, how do we kno w that, tempted like him, we should not have fallen like him, as soon, and perhaps with less resistance? How can we know w hat we should do if we were out of emplo yment, famine crouching, gaunt, and hungry , on our fireless hearth, and our children wailing for bread? We fall not because we are not enough tempted ! He that hath fallen may be at heart as honest as we. Ho w do we know that our daughter, sister, wife, could resist the abandonm ent, the desolation, the distress, the temptation, that sacrificed the virtue of their poor abandoned sister of shame? Perhaps they also have not fallen, because the y have not been sorely tempted! Wisely are we directed to pray that we ma y not be exposed to temp tation. Human justice must be ever uncertain. How man y judicial murders have been com mitted through ignorance of the phenom ena of insanit y! How man y men hung for murder who were no mor e murderers at heart than the jury that tried and the judge that sentenced them! It may well be doubted whether the ad-ministr ation of human laws, in every country, is not one gigantic mass of injustice and wrong. God seeth not as man seeth; and the most Page 97 of 621"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike abandoned criminal, black as he is before the world, ma y yet have continued to keep some little light burning in a corner of his s oul, which would long since have gone out in that of those who walk proudl y in the sunshine of imm aculate fame, if they had been tried and tempted like the poor outcast. We do not know even the outside life of men. We are not compe tent to pronounce even on their deeds . We do not know half the acts of wickedness or virtue, even of our most immediate fellows. We cannot say, with certaint y, even of our nearest friend, that he has not committed a particular sin, and broken a particular commandment. Let each man ask his own heart! Of how man y of our best and of our worst acts and qualities are our most intimate associates utterly unconscious! How man y virtues does not the world give us credit for, that we do not possess; or vices conde mn us for, of which we are not the slaves! It is but a smal l portion of our evil deeds and thoughts that ever comes to light; and of our few redee ming goodnes ses, the largest portion is known to God alone. We shall, therefore, be just in judging of other men, only when we are charitable ; and we should assume the prerogative of judging others onl y when the dut y is forced upon us; since we are so almost certain to err, and the consequences of error are so serious. N o man need covet the office of judge; for in assuming it he assumes the gravest and most oppressive responsibilit y. Yet yo u have assumed it; we all assume it; for man is ever ready to judge, and ever ready to condemn his neighbor, while upon the same state of case he acquits himself. See, therefore, that you exercise your office cautiousl y and charitabl y, lest, in passing judgment upon the cri minal, you commit a greater wrong than that for which you condemn him, and the consequences of which must be eternal. The faults and crimes and follies of other men are not unimportan t to us; but form a part of our mora l discipline. War and bloodshed at a distance, and frauds w hich do not affect our pecuniar y interest, yet touch us in our feelings, and concern our moral welfare. They have much to do with all thoughtful hearts. The public e ye may look unconcernedl y on the miserable victim of vice, and that shattered wreck of a man may move the mul titude to laughter or to scorn. But to the Mason, it is the form of sacred humanit y that is before him ; it is an erring fellow-being; a desolate, forlorn, forsaken soul; and his thoughts, enfolding the poor wretch, will be far deeper than those of indifference, ridicule, or conte mpt. All human offences, the whole s ystem of dishonest y, evasion, circu mventing, forbidden indulgence, and intriguing ambition, in which m en are struggling with each other, will be looked upon by a thoughtful Mason, not mere ly as a scene of mean toils and strifes, but as the solemn conflicts of imm ortal minds, for ends vast and mo mentous as their own being. It is a sad and unworthy strife, and ma y well be viewed with indignation ; but that indignation must melt into pity. For the stakes for which these gamest ers play are not those which they imagine, not those which are in sight. For example, this man plays for a pett y office, and gains it; but the real stake he gains is s ycophanc y, uncharitablen ess, slander, and deceit. Good men are too proud of their goodness. They are respectable; dishonor comes not near them; their countenanc e has weight and influence; their robes are unstained; the poisonou s breath of calu mny has never been breathed upon their fair name. How easy it is for them to look down with scorn upon the poor degraded offender; to pass him by with a lofty step; to Page 98 of 621"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike draw up the folds of their garment around the m, that they may not be soiled by his touch! Yet the Great Master of Virtue did not so; but descended to familiar intercourse with publicans and sinners, with the Samar itan woman, with the outcasts and the Pariahs of the Hebrew world. Many men think the mselves better, in proportion as they can detect sin in others! When they go over the catalogue of their neighbor's unhapp y derelic tions of temper or conduct, they often, a midst much apparent concern, feel a secret exultation, that destroys all their own pretensions to wisdom and modera tion, and even to virtue. Many even take actual pleasure in the sins of others; and this is the case with ever y one who se thoughts are often employed in agreeable comparisons of his own virtues with his neighbors' faults. The power of gentleness is too little seen in the world; the subduing influences of pity, the might of love, the control of mildness over passion, the commanding majesty of that perfect character which ming les grave displeasure with grief and pity for the offender. So it is that a Mason should treat his brethren who go astray . Not with bitterness; nor yet with good-natured easiness, nor with worldly indifference, nor with the philosophic coldness, nor with a laxity of conscience, that accounts everything well, that passes under the seal of public opinion; but with charit y, with pit ying loving- kindness. The human heart will not bow willingl y to what is infirm and wrong in human nature. If it yields to us, it must yield to what is divine in us. The wickedness of m y neighbor cannot submit to my wickedness; his sensualit y, for instance, to my anger against his vices. M y faults are not the instrum ents that are to arrest his faults. And therefore impatient reformers, and denouncing preachers, and hasty reprovers, and angr y parents, and irritab le relatives generall y fail, in their several departments, to reclaim the erring. A moral offence is sicknes s, pain, loss, dishonor, in the immortal part of man. It is guilt, and misery added to guilt. It is itself calamity; and brings upon itself, in addition, the calamity of God' s disapproval, the abhorrence of all virtuous men, and the soul's o wn abhorrence. Deal faithfull y, but patientl y and tenderl y, with this evil! It is no mat ter for petty provocation, nor for personal strife, nor for selfish irritation. Speak kindly to your erring brother! God pities him: Christ has died for him : Providence waits for him: Heaven's mer cy yearns toward hi m; and Heaven' s spirits are read y to welcome him back with joy. Let your voice be in unison with all those powers that God is using for his recover y! If one defrauds yo u, and exults at it, he is the most to be pitied of human beings. He has done himself a far deeper injury than he has done y ou. It is he, and not you, whom God regards with mingled displeasure and compassion; and His j udgmen t should be y our law. Among all the benedictions of the Holy Mount there is not one for this man; but for the merciful, the peace- makers, and the persecuted they are poured out freel y. We are all men of like passions, propensities, and exposures. There are elemen ts in us all, which might have been perverted, through the successive processes of moral deterioration, to the worst of crim es. The wretch whom the execrat ion of the thronging crowd pursues to Page 99 of 621"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the scaffold, is not worse than any one of that multitude might have become under simi lar circumstances. He is to be conde mned indeed, but also deepl y to be pitied. It does not become the frail and sinful to be vindictive toward even the worst criminals. We owe much to the good Providence of God, ordaining for us a lot more favorable to virtue. We all had that within us, that might have been pushed to the same excess: Perhaps we should have fallen as he did, with less tempt ation. Perhaps we have done acts, that, in proportion to the temptation or provocation, were less excusable than his great crime. Silent pity and sorrow for the victi m should mingle with our detestat ion of the guilt. Even the pirate who murders in cold blood on the high seas, is such a man as you or I might have been. Orphanage in childhood, or base and dissolute and abandoned parents; an unfriended youth; evil compan ions; ignorance and want of moral cultivation ; the temptations of sinful pleasure or grinding poverty ; familiarity with vice; a scorned and blighted name; seared and crushed affections; desperate fortunes; these are steps that might have led any one among us to unfurl upon the high seas the bloody flag of universal defiance; to wage war with our kind; to live the life and die the death of the reckless and remorseless freebooter. Many affecting relationships of humani ty plead with us to pit y him. His head once rested on a mother's bosom. He was once the object of sisterl y love and domesti c endear ment. Perhaps his hand, since often red with blood, once clasped another little loving hand at the altar. Pity him then; his blighted hopes and his crushed heart! It is proper that frail and erring creatures like us should do so; should feel the crime, but feel it as weak, temp ted, and rescued creatures should. It ma y be that when God weighs men's cri mes, He will take into consideration the temptations and the adverse circu mstances that led to the m, and the opportunities for moral culture of the offender; and it may be that our own offences will weigh heavier than we think, and the murderer's lighter than according to man's judgmen t. On all accounts, therefore, let the true Mason never forget the solemn injunction, necessar y to be observed at almost every moment of a busy life: \"JUDGE NOT, LEST YE YOURSELVES BE JUDGED: FOR WHATSOEVER J UDGMENT YE ME ASURE UNTO OT HERS, THE SAME SH ALL IN TUR N BE MEASURED U NTO Y OU.\" Such is the lesson taught the Provost and Judge.

Masonry has in all times religiousl y preserved that enlightened faith from which flow sublime Devotedness, the sentim ent of Fraternit y fruitful of good w orks, the spirit of indulgence and peace, of sweet hopes and effectual consolations; and inflexibi lity in the accomplishment of the most painful and arduous duties. It has always propagated it with ardor and perseverance; and therefore it labors at the present da y more zealousl y than ever. Scarcel y a Masonic discourse is pronounced, that does not demonstrat e the necessity and advantages of this faith, and especiall y recall the two constitut ive principles of religion, that make all religion, – love of God, and love of neighbor. Mason s carry these principles into the bosoms of their families and of societ y. While the Sectarians of former times enfeebled the religious spirit, Masonry, forming one great People over the whole globe, and march under the great banner of Charity and Benevolence, preserves feeling, strengthens it, extends it in its purit y and simpl icity, as it has alway s existed in the depths of the human heart, as it existed even under the dominion of the most ancient forms of worship, but where gross and debasing superstitions forbade its recognition. A Masonic Lodge should resemble a bee-hive, in which all the me mbers work together with ardor for the co mmon good. Masonry is not mad e for cold souls and narrow minds, that do not comprehend its lofty mission and sublim e apostolate. Here the anathe ma against lukewarm souls applies. To comfort misfortune, to popularize knowledge, to teach whatever is true and pure in religion and philosophy , to accustom men to respect order and the proprieties of life, to point out the way to genuine happiness, to prepare for that fortunate period, when all the factions of the Human Family, united by the bonds of Toleration and Fraternit y, shall be but one household, – these are labors that may well excite zeal and even enthusiasm. We do not now enlarge upon or elaborate these ideas. We but utter them to you briefly , as hints, upon w hich you may at your leisure reflect. Hereafter, if you continue to advance, they will be unfolded, explained, and developed.

It asks of its initiates nothing that it is not pos sible and even easy for the m to perform. Its teachings are eminen tly practical; and its statutes can be obe yed by every just, upright, and honest man, no matter what his faith or creed. Its object is to attain the greatest practic al good, without seeking to make men perfect. It does not meddl e with the domain of religion, nor inquire into the mysteries of regenerat ion. It teaches those truths that are written by the finger of God upon the heart of man, those views of duty which have been wrought out by the med itations of the studious, confirmed by the allegi ance of the good and wise, and stamp ed as sterling by the response the y find in every uncorrupted mind. It does not dogmati ze, nor vainl y imagine dogmati c certaint y to be attainable. Masonry does not occup y itself with cry ing down this world, with its splendid beauty, its thrilling interests, its glorious works, its noble and holy affections; nor exhort us to detach our hearts from this earthl y life, as empty, fleeting, and unworthy , and fix them upon Heaven, as the onl y sphere deserving the love of the loving or the med itation of the wise. It teaches that man has high duties to perform, and a high destin y to fulfill, on this earth; that this world is not mere ly the portal to another; and that this life, though not our onl y one, is an integral one, and the particular one with which we are here meant to be concerned; that the Present is our scene of action, and the Future for speculation and for trust; that man was sent upon the earth to live in it, to enjoy it, to study it, to love it, to emb ellish it, to make the most of it. It is his countr y, on which he should lavish his affections and his efforts. It is here his influences are to operate. It is his hou se, and not a tent; his home, and not merely a school. He is sent into this world, not to be constantl y hankering after, dreaming of, preparing for another; but to do his dut y and fulfill his destin y on this earth; to do all that lies in his power to improve it, to render it a scene of elevat ed happiness to himself, to those around him, to those who are to come after hi m. His life here is part of his immortality; and this world, also, is among the stars. And thus, Masonry teaches us, will man best prepare for that Future which he hopes for. The Unseen cannot hold a higher place in our affections than the Seen and the Fam iliar. The law of our being is Love of Life, and its interests and adornmen ts; love of the world in which our lot is cast, engros sment with the interests and affections of earth. Not a low or sensual love; not love of wealth, of fame, of ease, of power, of splendor. Not low worldliness; but the love of Earth as the garden on which the Creator has lavished such miracles of beaut y; as the habitat ion of human ity, the arena of its conflicts, the scene of its illimitable progress, the dwelling- place of the wise, the good, the active, the loving, and the dear; the place of opportunit y for the develop ment by means of sin and suffering and sorrow, of the noblest passions, the loftiest virtues, and the tenderest sympathies. They take very unprofitable pains, who endeavor to persuade men that they are obliged wholly to despise this world, and all that is in it, even whilst the y themse lves live here. God hath not taken all that pains in forming and framing and furnishing and adorning the world, that they who were made by Him to live in it should despise it. It will be enough, if they do not love it too immoderately. It is useless to attempt to extinguish all those affections and passions which are and alwa ys will be inseparable from human nature.

Those only who feel a deep interest in, and affection for, this world, will work resolutel y for its amelioration. Those who under-value this life, naturall y become querulous and discontented, and lose their interest in the welfare of their fellows. To serve them, and so to do our dut y as Masons, we must feel that the object is worth the exertion; and be content with this world in which God has placed us, until He permi ts us to remove to a better one. He is here with us, and does not dee m this an unworthy world. It is a serious thing to defame and belie a whole world; to speak of it as the abode of a poor, toiling, drudging, ignorant, contem ptible race. You w ould not so discredit your family, your friendly circle, your village, your city, your country. The world is not a wretched and a worthless one; nor is it a misfortune, but a thing to be thankful for, to be a man. If life is worthless, so also is imm ortality. In societ y itself, in that living mechanism of human relation- ships that spreads itself over the world, there is a finer essence within, that as trul y moves it, as any power, heav y or expansive, moves the sounding manufac tory or the swift-flying car. The man-machine hurries to and fro upon the earth, stretches out its hands on every side, to toil, to barter, to unnumber ed labors and enterprises; and almost always the motive, that which moves it, is something that takes hold of the comforts, affections, and hopes of social existence. True, the mechan ism often works with difficult y, drags heavil y, grates and screams with harsh collision. True, the essence of finer motive, becom ing intermixed with baser and coarser ingredients, often clogs, obstructs, jars, and deranges the free and noble action of social life. But he is neither grateful nor wise, who looks cy nically on all this, and loses the fine sense of social good in its perversions. That I can be a friend , that I can have a friend, though it were but one in the world; that fact, that wondrou s good fortune, we may set against all the sufferings of our s ocial nature. That there is such a place on earth as a home , that resort and sanctuary of in-walled and shielded joy, we may set against all the surrounding desolations of life. That one can be a true, social man, can speak his true thoughts, amidst all the janglings of controversy and the warring of opinions; that fact from within, outweighs all facts from without. In the visible aspect and action of societ y, often repulsive and anno ying, we are apt to lose the due sense of its invisible blessings. As in Nature it is not the coarse and palpable, not soils and rains, nor even fields and flowers, that are so beautiful, as the invisible spirit of wisdom and beauty that pervades it; so in society, it is the invisible, and therefore unobserved, that is most beautiful. What nerves the arm of toil? If man minded himself alone, he would fling down the spade and axe, and rush to the desert; or roam through the world as a wilderness, and make that world a desert. His home, which he sees not, perhaps, but once or twice in a da y, is the invisible bond of the world. It is the good, strong, and noble faith that men have in each other, which gives the loftiest character to business, trade, and comm erce. Fraud occurs in the rush of bu siness; but it is the exception. Honest y is the rule; and all the frauds in the world cannot tear the great bond of human confidence. If they could, co mmerce would furl its sails on every sea, and all the cities of the world would crumbl e into ruins.

The most striking feature of the politica l state is not govern ments, nor constitutions, nor law s, nor enact ments, nor the judicial power, nor the police; but the universal will of the people to be governed b y the common weal. Take off that restraint, and no governmen t on earth could stand for an hour. Of the many teachings of Masonry , one of the most valuable is, that we should not depreciat e this life. It does not hold, that when we reflect on the destin y that awaits man on earth, we ought to bedew his cradle with our tears; but, like the Hebrew s, it hails the birth of a child with joy, and holds that his birthda y should be a festival. It has no sy mpathy with those who profess to have proved this life, and found it littl e worth; who have deliberate ly made up their minds that it is far more miserabl e than happy; because its emp loyments are tedious, and their schemes often baffled, their friendships broken, or their friends dead, its pleasures palled, and its honors faded, and its paths beaten, familiar, and dull. Masonry deems it no mark of great piet y toward God to disparage, if not despise, the state that He has ordained for us. It does not absurdl y set up the clai ms of another world, not in comparison merely, but in compe tition, with the claims of this. It looks upon both as parts of one system. It holds that a man may make the best of this world and of another at the same time. It does not teach its initiat es to think better of other works and dispensations of God, by thinking meanly of these. It does not look upon life as so much time lost; nor regard its emp loyments as trifles unworth y of immortal beings; nor tell its followers to fold their arms, as if in disdain of their state and species; but it looks soberl y and cheerfull y upon the world, as a theatre of worth y action, of exalted usefulness, and of rational and innocent enjoyment. It holds that, with all its evils, life is a blessing. To den y that is to destroy the basis of all religion, natural and revealed. The very foundation of all religion is laid on the firm belief that God is good; and if this life is an evil and a curse, no such belief can be rationall y entertained. To level our satire at human ity and human existence, as mean and contemptible; to look on this world as the habitation of a miserabl e race, fit only for mockery and scorn; to consider this earth as a dungeon or a prison, which has no blessing to offer but escape from it, is to extinguish the primal light of faith and hope and happiness, to destroy the basis of religion, and Truth's foundation in the goodnes s of God. If it indeed be so, then it matters not what else is true or not true; speculation is vain and faith is vain; and all that belongs to man's highest being is buried in the ruins of misanthropy, melanchol y, and despair. Our love of life; the tenaci ty with which, in sorro w and suffering, we cling to it; our attachment to our home, to the spot that gave us birth, to any place, however rude, unsightl y, or barren, on which the histor y of our ye ars has been written, all show how dear are the ties of kindred and society. Misery makes a greater impression upon us than happiness; because the former is not the habit of our m inds. It is a strange, unusual guest, and we are more conscious of its presence. Happiness lives with us, and we forget it. It does not excite us, nor disturb the order and course of our thoughts. A great agony is an epoch in our life. We re-mem ber our afflictions, as we do the storm and earthquake, Page 105 of 621"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike because they are out of the common course of things.

We mark and signalize the times of cala mity; but man y happy days and unnoted periods of enjoyment pass, that are unrecorded either in the book of mem ory, or in the scanty annals of our thanksgiving. We are littl e disposed and less able to call up from the dim remembrances of our pa st years, the peaceful moments, the eas y sensations, the bright thoughts, the quiet reveries, the throngs of kind affections in which life flowed on, bearing us almost unconsciously upon its bosom, because it bore us calm ly and gently. Life is not only good; but it has been glorious in the experience of millions. The glor y of all human virtue clothes it. The splendors of devotedness, beneficence, and heroism are upon it; the crown of a thousand mar tyrdoms is upon its brow. The brightness of the soul shines through this visible and someti mes darkened life; through all its surrounding cares and labors. The humb lest life may feel its connection with its Infinite Source. There is something mighty in the frail inner man; something of immortality in this momentary and transient being. The mind stretches away, on ever y side, into infinity. Its thoughts flash abroad, far into the boundless, the immeasurable, the infinite ; far into the great, dark, teeming future; and becom e powers and influences in other ages. To know its wonderful Author, to bring down wi sdom from the Eternal Stars, to bear upward its homage, gratitude, and love, to the Ruler of all worlds, to be im mortal in our influences projected far into the slow-approaching Future, makes life most worthy and most glorious. Life is the wonderful creation of God. It is light, sprung from void darkness; power, waked from inertness and i mpotenc e; being created from nothing; and the contrast ma y well enkindle wonder and delight. It is a rill from the infinite, overflowing goodne ss; and from the moment when it first gushes up into the light, to that when it mingles with the ocean of Eternity, that Goodness attends it and minist ers to it. It is a great and glorious gift. There is gladness in its infant voices; joy in the buo yant step of its y outh; deep satisfaction in its strong ma turity; and peace in its quiet age. There is good for the good; virtue for the faithful; and victor y for the valiant. There is, even in this humbl e life, an infinit y for those whose desires are boundles s. There are blessings upon its birth; there is hope in its death; and eternity in its prospect. Thus earth, which binds man y in chains, is to the Mason both the starting- place and goal of imm ortality. Many it buries in the rubbish of dull cares and wearying vanities; but to the Mason it is the loft y mount of medit ation, where Heaven, and Infinity and Eternit y are spread before him and around hi m. To the lofty-minded, the pure, and the virtuous, this life is the beginning of Heaven, and a part of imm ortality. God hath appointed one remed y for all the evils in the world; and that is a contented spirit. We may be reconciled to poverty and a low fortune, if we suffer contentedn ess and equanimity to make the proportions. No man is poor who doth not think hi mself so; but if, in a full fortune, with i mpatience he desires more, he proclai ms his wants and his beggarl y condition. This virtue of contentedness was the sum of all the old moral philosophy , and is of most universal use in the whole course of our lives, and the onl y instrument to ease the burdens of the world and the enmities of sad chances. It is the great reasonableness of complying with the Divine Providence, which governs all the world, and hath so ordered us in the administration of His great family. It is fit that God should dispense His gifts as Page 106 of 621"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike He pleases; and if we murmur here, we may, at the next melancholy, be troubled that He did not make us to be angels or stars. We ourselves make our fortunes good or bad; and when G od lets loose a Tyrant upon us, or a sicknes s, or scorn, or a lessened fortune, if we fear to die, or know not how to be patient, or are proud, or covetous, then the calamity sits heav y on us. But if we kno w how to manage a noble principle, and fear not death so much as a dishonest action, and think impatience a worse evil than a fever, and pride to be the greatest disgrace as well as the greatest folly, and povert y far preferable to the torments of avarice, we may still bear an even mind and smile at the reverses of fortune and the ill-nature of Fate. If thou hast lost th y land, do not also lose thy constanc y; and if thou must die sooner than others, or than thou didst expect, yet do not die impatiently. For no chance is evil to him who is content, and to a man nothing is miser able unless it be unreasonable. No man can make another man to be his slave, unless that other hath first enslaved himself to life and death, to pleasure or pain, to hope or fear; command these passions, and you are freer than the Parthian Kings. When an enem y reproaches us, let us look on him as an impar tial relator of our faults; for he will tell us truer than our fondest friend will, and we ma y forgive his anger, whilst we make use of the plainness of his decla mation. The ox, when he is wear y, treads truest; and if there be nothing else in abuse, but that it makes us to walk waril y, and tread sure for fear of our ene mies, that is better than to be flattered into pride and carelessness. If thou fallest from thy employment in public, take sanctuar y in an honest retirem ent, being indifferent to thy gain abroad, or thy safety at home. When the north wind blows hard, and it rains sadl y, we do not sit down in it and cry ; but defend ourselves against it with a warm garment, or a good fire and a dry roof. So w hen the storm of a sad mischance beats upon our spirits, we may turn it into something that is good, if we resolve to make it so; and with equanimity and patienc e may shelter ourselves from its incle ment pitiless pelting. If it develop our patience, and give occasion for heroic endurance, it hath done us good enough to recompense us sufficientl y for all the temporal affliction; for so a wise man shall overrule his stars; and have a greater influence upon his own content, than all the constella tions and planets of the firmament. Compar e not thy condition with the few above thee, but to secure th y content, look upon those thousand s with whom thou wouldst not, for an y interest, change thy fortune and condition. A soldier must not think himself unprosperous, if he be not successful as Alexander or Wellington ; nor any man deem himself unfortunate that he hath not the wealth of Rothschild; but rather let the former rejoice that he is not lessened like the many generals who went down hor se and man before Napoleon, and the latter that he is not the beggar who, bareheaded in the bleak winter wind holds out his tatter ed hat for charit y.

Is that beast better, that hath two or three mountains to graze on, than the little bee that feeds on dew or mann a, and lives upon what falls every morning from the store-houses of Heaven, clouds and Providence? There are some instances of fortune and a fair condition that cannot stand with some others; but if you desire this, you must lose that, and unless y ou be content with one, you lose the comfor t of both.

If you would be famous as Epa minondas, accept also his povert y, for it added lustre to his person, and env y to his fortune, and his virtue without it could not have been so excellent. If you would have the reputation of a mar tyr, you must needs accept his persecution; if of a benefactor of the world, the world's in justice; if truly great, you must expect to see the mob prefer lesser men to yourself. God esteems it one of His glories, that He brings good out of evil; and therefore it were but reason we should trust Him to govern His own world as He pleases; and that we should patiently wait until the change cometh, or the reason is discovered. A Mason 's contentedness must by no means be a mere contented selfishness, like his who, comfortable himself, is indifferent to the discomfor t of others. There will always be in this world wrongs to forgive, suffering to allevia te, sorrow asking for s ympathy, necessities and destitution to relieve, and amp le occasion for the exercise of active charity and beneficenc e. And he who sits unconcerned amidst it all, perhaps enjoy ing his own comforts and luxuries the more, by contrasting them with the hungry and ragged destitution and shivering misery of his fellows, is not contented, but selfish and unfeeling. It is the saddest of all sights upon this earth, that of a man lazy and luxurious, or hard and penurious, to whom want appeals in vain, and suffering cries in an unknown tongue.

These Degrees are also intended to teach more than mora ls. The symbols and ceremon ies of Masonry have more than one meaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth. They hint it only, at least; and their varied meanings are onl y to be discovered by reflection and study. Truth is not only symbolized by Light, but as the ray of light is separable into rays of different colors, so is truth separable into kinds. It is the province of Masonry to teach all truths – not moral truth alone, but political and philosophical, and even religious truth, so far as concerns the great and essential principles of each.

It penetrates beyond the region of vague senti ment; beyond the regions where mora lizers and philosophers have woven their fine theories and elaborated their beautiful maxims, to the very depths of the heart, rebuking our littlenesses and meannesses, arraigning our prejudices and passions, and warring against the arm ies of our vices. It wars against the passions that spring out of the bosom of a world of fine sentim ents, a world of adm irable sayings and foul practices, of good maxi ms and bad deeds; whose darker passions are not onl y restrained by custom and cere mony, but hidden even from itself by a veil of beautiful sentim ents.

Their Masonry takes its chance in general and inefficient sentimen t, mournful ly barren of results; in words and formul as and fine professions. Most men have sentiments , but not principles . The former are tempor ary sensations, the latter permanen t and controll ing impressions of goodness and virtue. The former are general and involuntar y, and do not rise to the character of virtue. Every one feels the m. They flash up spontaneousl y in every heart. The latter are rules of action, and shape and control our conduct; and it is these that Masonry insists upon. We approve the right; but pursue the wrong. It is the old story of human deficienc y. No one abets or praises injustice, fraud, oppression, covetousness, revenge, envy, or slander; and yet how man y who condemn these things, are the mselves guilty of them. It is no rare thing for him whose indignation is kindled at a tale of wicked injustice, cruel oppression, base slander, or miser y inflicted by unbridled indulgence ; whose anger fla mes in behalf of the injured and ruined victims of wrong; to be in some relation unjust, or oppres sive, or envious, or self-indulgent, or a careless talker of others. How w onderfull y indignant the penurious man often is, at the avarice or want of public spirit of another! A great Preacher well said, \"Therefore thou art inexcusable. O Man, whosoever thou art, that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest, doest the same things.\" It is amaz ing to see how men can talk of virtue and honor, whose life denies both. It is curious to see with what a marvel lous facility many bad men quote Scripture. It seems to comfort their evil consciences, to use good w ords; and to gloze over bad deeds with hol y texts, wrested to their purpose. Often, the more a man talks about Charity and Tolerat ion, the less he has of either; the more he talks about Virtue, the smal ler stock he has of it. The mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart; but often the very reverse of what the man practises. And the vicious and sensual often express, and in a sense feel, strong disgust at vice and sensuality. Hypocrisy is not so common as is imagined. Here, in the Lodge, virtue and vice are matters of reflection and feeling only. There is little opportunit y here, for the practic e of either; and Ma sons yield to the argumen t here, with facility and readiness; because nothing is to follow. It is eas y, and safe, here, to feel upon these matters. But to- morrow, when they breathe the atmosphere of worldly gains and competitions, and the passions are again stirred at the opportunities of unlawful pleasure, all their fine emotions about virtue, all their generous abhorrence of selfishness and sensualit y, melt away like a morning cloud. For the time, their emotions and sentim ents are sincere and real. Men ma y be reall y, in a certain way, interested in Masonry , while fatally deficient in virtue. It is not always hypocrisy.

Many a man earnestl y desires to be a good Mason. He says so, and is sincere. But if y ou require him to resist a certain passion, to sacrifice a certain indulgence, to control his appetit e at a particular feast, or to keep his temp er in a dispute, you will find that he does not wish to be a good Ma son, in that particular case ; or, wishing, is not able to resist his wor se impulses. The duties of life are more than life. The law imposeth it upon ever y citizen, that he prefer the urgent service of his countr y before the safety of his life. If a man be com manded, saith a great writer, to bring ordnance or mun ition to relieve any of the King's town s that are distressed, then he cannot for any danger of temp est justify the throwing of them overboard; for there it holdeth which was spoken b y the Roman, when the same necessit y of weather was alleged to hold him from embarking : \" Necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam :\" it needs that I go: it is not necessary I should live. How ungratefull y he slinks awa y, who dies, and does nothing to reflect a glory to Heaven! How barren a tree he is, who lives, and spreads, and cumbers the ground, y et leaves not one seed, not one good work to generate another after him! All cannot leave alike; yet all may leave something , answering their proportions and their kinds. Those are dead and withered grains of corn, out of which there will not one ear spring. He will hardl y find the way to Heaven, who desires to go thither alone. Industry is never wholly unfruitful. If it bring not joy with the incoming profit, it will yet banish mischief from thy busied gates. There is a kind of good angel waiting upon Diligence that ever carries a laurel in his hand to crown her. How un worthy was that man of the world who never did aught, but onl y lived and died! That we have liberty to do anything, we should account it a gift from the favoring Heavens; that we have minds sometimes inclining us to use that liberty well, is a great bounty of the Deity. Masonry is action, and not inertness. It requires its Initiat es to WORK, activel y and earnestl y, for the benefit of their brethren, their country , and mankind. It is the patron of the oppres sed, as it is the comfort er and consoler of the unfortunate and wretched. It seems to it a worthier honor to be the instrum ent of advancem ent and reform, than to enjoy all that rank and office and lofty titles can bestow. It is the advocate of the common people in those things which concern the best interests of mankind. It hates insolent power and impudent usurpation. It pities the poor, the sorrowing, the disconsolate; it endeavors to raise and improve the ignorant, the sunken, and the degraded. Its fidelit y to its mission will be accuratel y evidenced, by the extent of the efforts it employs, and the means it sets on foot, to i mprove the people at large and to better their condition; chiefest of which, within its reach, is to aid in the education of the children of the poor. An intelligen t people, informed of its rights, will soon come to know its power, and cannot long be oppressed; but if there be not a sound and virtuous populace, the elaborate ornamen ts at the top of the pyramid of society will be a wretched compensation for the want of solidit y at the base. It is never safe for a nation to repose on the lap of ignorance: and if there ever was a time when public tranquillit y was insured by the absence of knowledge, that season is pa st.

The improvem ent of the mass of the people is the grand securit y for popular liberty; in the neglect of which, the politeness, refinement, and knowledge accumulated in the higher orders and wealthier classes will some day perish like dry grass in the hot fire of popular fur y. It is not the mission of Masonry to engage in plots and conspiracies against the civil governm ent. It is not the fanatical propagandist of any creed or theory ; nor does it proclai m itself the enemy of kings. It is the apostle of libert y, equalit y, and fraternit y; but it is no more the high- priest of republican ism than of constitutional monarch y. It contracts no entangling alliances with any sect of theorists, dream ers, or philosophers. It does not know those as its Initiates who assail the civil order and all lawful authorit y, at the same time that they propose to deprive the dying of the consolations of religion. It sits apart from all sects and creeds, in its own calm and simple dignity, the same under every govern ment. It is still that which it was in the cradle of the human race, when no human foot had trodden the soil of Assyria and Eg ypt, and no colonies had crossed the Himala yas into Southern India, Media, or Etruria. It gives no countenance to anarch y and licentiousness; and no illusion of glor y, or extravagant emulation of the ancients inflames it with an unnatural thirst for ideal and Utopian liberty. It teaches that in rectitude of life and sobriety of habits is the onl y sure guarantee for the continuance of politica l freedom ; and it is chiefl y the soldier of the sanctity of the laws and the rights of conscience. It recognizes it as a truth, that necessit y, as well as abstract right and ideal justice, must have its part in the making of laws, the administration of affairs, and the regulation of relations in society. It sees, indeed, that necessity rules in all the affairs of man. It knows that where an y man, or any number or race of men, are so imbec ile of intellec t, so degraded, so incapable of self- control, so inferior in the scale of humani ty, as to be unfit to be intrusted with the highest prerogatives of citizenship, the great law of necessit y; for the peace and safety of the community and countr y, requires them to remain under the control of those of larger intell ect and superior wisdom. It trusts and believes that God will, in his own good tim e, work out his own great and wise purpose s; and it is willing to wait, where it does not see its own way clear to some certain good. It hopes and longs for the da y when all the races of m en, even the lowest, will be elevated, and become fitted for politica l freedom ; when, like all other evils that afflict the earth, pauperis m, and bondage or abject dependence, shall cease and disappear. But it does not preach revolution to those who are fond of kings, nor rebellion that can end onl y in disaster and defeat, or in sub stituting one tyrant for another, or a mul titude of despots for one. Wherever a people is fit to be free and to govern itself, and generousl y strives to be so, there go all its sympathies. It detests the tyrant, the lawless oppressor, the m ilitary usurper, and him who abuses a lawful power. It frowns upon cruelt y, and a wanton disregard of the rights of humanit y. It abhors the selfish emplo yer, and exerts its influence to lighten the burdens which want and dependence impose upon the workman, and to foster that humanity and kindness w hich man owes to even the poorest and most unfortunate brother.

The dread of punishmen t will never mak e a Mason an acco mplice in so corrupting his countr ymen, and a teacher of depravit y and barbarit y. If anywhere, as has heretofore happened, a tyrant should send a satirist on his t yranny to be convicted and punished as a libeller, in a court of justice, a Mason, if a juror in such a case, though in sight of the scaffold strea ming with the blood of the innocent, and within hearing of the clash of the bayonets meant to overawe the court, would rescue the intrepid satirist from the tyrant's fangs, and send his officers out from the court with defeat and disgrace. Even if all law and liberty were tramp led under the feet of Jacobinical demagogues or a military banditti, and great crimes were perpetrated with a high hand against all who were deservedl y the objects of public veneration ; if the people, overthrowing law, roared like a sea around the courts of justice, and demand ed the blood of those who, during the temporary fit of insanit y and drunken delirium , had chanced to become odious to it, for true words manfu lly spoken, or unpopular acts bravel y done, the Masonic juror, unawed alike by the single or the man y-headed tyrant, would consult the dictates of duty alone, and stand with a noble firmness between the human tigers and their coveted prey. The Mason would mu ch rather pass his life hidden in the recesses of the deepest obscurit y, feeding his mind even with the visions and i magina tions of good deeds and noble actions, than to be placed on the most splendid throne of the universe, tantaliz ed with a denial of the practice of all which can mak e the greatest situation any other than the greatest curse. And if he has been enabled to lend the slightest step to any great and laudable de-signs; if he has had any share in an y measure giving quiet to private property and to private conscience, making lighter the yoke of poverty and dependence, or relieving deserving men from oppression; if he has aided in securing to his countr ymen that best posses sion, peace; if lie has joined in reconciling the different sections of his own country to each other, and the people to the govern ment of their own creating; and in teaching the citizen to look for his protection to the laws of his countr y, and for his comfort to the good-will of his countr ymen; if he has thus taken his part with the best of met e in the best of their actions, he may well shut the book, even if he migh t wish to read a page or two mor e. It is enough for his measure. He has not lived in vain. Masonry teaches that all power is delegated for the good, and not for the injury of the People; and that, when it is perverted from the original purpose, the compac t is broken, and the right ought to be resumed ; that resistance to power usurped is not merely a duty which man owes to himself and to his neighbor, but a dut y which he owes to his God, in asserting and maintaining the rank which He gave him in the creation. This principle neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle nor the enervation of refinem ent extinguish. It makes it base for a man to suffer when he ought to act; and, tending to preserve to him the original destinations of Providence, spurns at the arrogant assumptions of Tyrants and vindicates the independent quality of the race of which we are a part. The wise and well- informed Mason will not fail to be the votar y of Libert y and Justice. He will be read y to exert himself in their defence, wherever the y exist. It cannot be a ma tter of indifference to him when his own libert y and that of other men, with whose meri ts and Page 114 of 621"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike capacities he is acquaint ed, are involved in the event of the struggle to be made ; but his attachment will be to the cause, as the cause of man; and not mer ely to the countr y. Wherever there is a people that understands the value of political justice, and is prepared to assert it, that is his countr y; wherever he can most contribute to the diffusion of these principles and the real happiness of mank ind, that is his countr y. Nor does he de-sire for any country any other benefit than justice. The true Mason identifies the honor of his countr y with his own. N othing more conduces to the beaut y and glor y of one's countr y than the preservation against all enemies of its civil and religious liberty. The world will never willingl y let die the names of those patriots who in her different ages have received upon their own breasts the blows aimed by insolent enemies at the bosom of their countr y. But also it conduces, and in no small measure, to the beaut y and glor y of one's countr y, that justice should alwa ys be admin istered there to all alike, and neither denied, sold, nor delayed to any one; that the interest of the poor should be looked to, and none starve or be houseless, or cla mor in vain for work; that the child and the feeble woman should not be overworked, or even the apprentice or slave be stinted of food or overtasked or merci lessly scourged; and that God's great laws of merc y, humanity, and compassion should be everywhere enforced, not onl y by the statutes, but also b y the power of public opinion. And he who labors, often against reproach and obloquy , and oftener against indifference and apathy , to bring about that fortunate condition of things when that great code of divine law shall be ever ywhere and punctuall y obeyed, is no less a patriot than he who bares his bosom to the hostile steel in the ranks of his country 's soldiery. For fortitude is not only seen resplendent on the field of battle and amid the clash of ar ms, but he display s its energ y under ever y difficult y and against ever y assailant. He who w ars against cruelty, oppression, and hoar y abuses, fights for his country 's honor, w hich these things soil; and her honor is as importan t as her existence. Often, indeed, the warfare against those abuses which disgrace one's country is quite as hazardous and more discouraging than that against her enemies in the field; and mer its equal, if not greater reward. For those Greeks and Romans who are the objects of our adm iration employed hardly any other virtue in the extirpation of tyrants, than that love of libert y, which made them prompt in seizing the sword, and gave the m strength to use it. With facili ty they accomp lish the undertaking, amid the general shout of praise and joy; nor did they engage in the attempt so much as an enterprise of perilous and doubtful issue, as a contest the most glorious in which virtue could be signalized ; which infallib ly led to present recompense; which bound their brows with wreaths of laurel, and consigned their memories to immortal fame. But he who a ssails hoary abuses, regarded perhaps with a superstitious reverence, and around which old laws stand as ramp arts and bastions to defend the m; who denounces acts of cruelt y and outrage on humanit y which make every perpetrator thereof his personal enemy, and perhaps make him looked upon with su spicion by the people among whom he lives, as the assailant of an established order of things of which he assails only the abuses, and of laws of which he attacks only the violations, – he can scarcel y look for present recompense, nor that his living brows will be wreathed with laurel. And if, contending Page 115 of 621"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike against a dark array of long-received opinions, superstitions, obloquy , and fears, which most men dread more than they do an army terrible with banners, the Mason overco mes, and emerges from the contest victorious; or if he does not conquer, but is borne down and swept awa y by the mighty current of prejudice, passion, and interest; in either case, the loftiness of spirit which he displa ys merits for him more than a mediocrity of fame. He has alread y lived too long who has survived the ruin of his country ; and he who can enjoy life after such an event deserves not to have lived at all. Nor does he an y more deserve to live who looks contentedl y upon abuses that disgrace, and cruelties that dishonor, and scenes of miser y and destitut ion and brutaliz ation that disfigure his countr y; or sordid me anness and ignoble revenges that make her a by-word and a scoff among all generous nations; and does not endeavor to remed y or prevent either. Not often is a countr y at war; nor can ever y one be allowed the privilege of offering his heart to the enemy's bullets. But in these patrioti c labors of peace, in preventing, remedying, and reforming evils, oppressions, w rongs, cruelties, and outrages, ever y Mason can unite; and ever y one can effect something, and share the honor and glory of the result. For the cardinal names in the histor y of the human mind are few and easil y to be counted up; but thousands and tens of thousands spend their days in the preparations which are to speed the predestined change, in gathering and amassing the materials which are to kindle and give light and warmth, when the fire from heaven shall have descended on them. Numberl ess are the sutlers and pioneers, the engineers and artisans, who attend the march of intell ect. Many move forward in detach ments, and level the wa y over which the chariot is to pass, and cut down the obstacles that would imped e its progress; and these too have their reward. If the y labor diligentl y and faithfull y in their calling, not onl y will the y enjoy that calm content ment which diligence in the lowliest task never fails to win; not only will the sweat of their brows be sweet, and the sweetener of the rest that follows; but, when the victory is at last achieved, they will come in for a share in the glor y; even as the mean est soldier who fought at Marathon or at King's Mountain became a sharer in the glory of those saving days; and within his own hou sehold circle, the approbation of which approaches the nearest to that of an approving conscience, was looked upon as the representativ e of all his brother- heroes; and could tell such tales as made the tear glisten on the cheek of his wife, and lit up his bo y's eyes with an unwonted sparkling eagerness. Or, if he fell in the fight, and his place by the fireside and at the table at home was thereafter vacant, that place was sacred; and he was often talked of there in the long winter evenings; and his famil y was deemed fortunate in the neighborhood, because it had had a hero in it, who had fallen in defence of his country . Remember that life's length is not measured by its hours and da ys, but by that which we have done therein for our countr y and kind. A useless life is short, if it last a century ; but that of Alexander was long as the life of the oak, though he died at thirty-five. We may do much in a few y ears, and we ma y do nothing in a lifetim e. If we but eat and drink and sleep, and let everything go on around us as it pleases; or if we live but to am ass wealth or gain office or wear titles, we migh t as well not have lived at all; nor have we any right to expect immortality.

Masonry is not a religion. He who mak es of it a religious belief, falsifies and denaturaliz es it. The Brahmin, the Jew, the Mahome tan, the Catholic, the Protestant, each professing his peculiar religion, sanctioned by the laws, by time, and by climate, must needs retain it, and cannot have two religions; for the social and sacred laws adapted to the usages, manners, and prejudices of particular countries, are the work of men. But Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundation of all religions. All that ever existed have had a basis of truth; and all have overlaid that truth with errors. The pri mitive truths taught by the Redeem er were sooner corrupted, and inter mingled and alloyed with fictions than when taught to the first of our race. Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitan ts of every clime, to the man of ever y creed. It has taught no doctrines, except those truths that tend directl y to the well-being of man; and those who have attempted to direct it toward useless vengeance, political ends, and Jesuitism, have merely perverted it to purposes foreign to its pure spirit and real nature. Mankind outgrow s the sacrifices and the mythologies of the childhood of the world. Yet it is easy for hum an indolence to linger near these helps, and refuse to pass further on. So the unadventurous Nomad in the Tartarian wild keeps his flock in the same close-cropped circle where they first learned to browse, w hile the progressive man roves ever forth \"to fresh fields and pastures new.\" The latter is the true Mason; and the best and indeed the onl y good M ason is he who with the power of bu siness does the work of life; the upright mechanic, merchan t, or farmer, the man with the power of thought, of ju stice, or of love, he whose whole life is one great act of perform ance of Masonic duty. The natural use of the strength of a strong man or the wisdom of a wise one, is to do the work of a strong man or a wise one. The natural work of Masonry is practical life; the use of all the faculties in their proper spheres, and for their natural function. Love of Truth, justice, and generosit y as attributes of God, must appear in a life marked by these qualities; that is the onl y effectua l ordinance of Masonry . A profession of one's convictions, joining the Order, assuming the obligations, assisting at the ceremonies, are of the same value in science as in Masonry; the natural form of Masonry is goodness, moral ity, living a true, ju st, affectionate, self-faithful life, from the mot ive of a good man. It is loyal obedience to God's law. The good Ma son does the good thing which comes in his way , and because it comes in his way; from a love of duty , and not merely because a law, enacted by man or God, commands his will to do it. He is true to his mind, his conscience, heart, and soul, and feels small temptation to do to others what he would not wish to receive from them. He will deny himself for the sake of his brother near at hand. His desire attracts in the line of his Page 119 of 621"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike duty, both being in conjunction. Not in vain does the poor or the op-pressed look up to him. You find such men in all Christian sects, Protestant and Catholic, in all the great religious parties of the civilized world, among Buddhists, Mahome tans, and Jews. They are kind fathers, generous citiz ens, unimpea chable in their business, beautiful in their daily lives. You see their Masonry in their work and in their play. It appears in all the forms of their activity, individual, domestic, social, ecclesiastic al, or politic al. True Masonry within must be moral ity without. It must become eminent morality, which is philanthrop y. The true Mason loves not onl y his kindred and his countr y, but all mankind ; not only the good, but also the evil, among his brethren. He has more goodness than the channels of his dail y life will hold. It runs over the banks, to water and to feed a thousand thirst y plants. Not content with the dut y that lies along his track, he goes out to seek it; not only willing , he has a salient longing to do good, to spread his truth, his justice, his generosit y, his Ma sonry over all the world. His dail y life is a profes sion of his Ma sonry, published in perpetual good-will to men. He can not be a persecutor. Not more naturall y does the beaver build or the mocking- bird sing his own wild, gushing melody, than the true Mason lives in this beautiful outward life. So from the perennial spring swells forth the stream, to quicken the meadow with new access of green, and perfect beauty bursting into bloom. Thus Ma sonry does the work it was mean t to do. The Mason does not sigh and weep, and make grimac es. He lives right on. If his life is, as whose is not, mark ed with errors, and with sins, he ploughs over the barren spot with his remorse, sows with new seed, and the old desert blossoms like a rose. He is not confined to set forms of thought, of action, or of feeling. He accepts what his mind regards as true, what his con science decides is right, what his heart deems generous and noble; and all else he puts far from him. Though the ancient and the honorable of the Earth bid him bow down to the m, his stubborn knees bend only at the bidding of his manl y soul. His Masonry is his freedo m before God, not his bondage unto m en. His mind acts after the universal law of the intellec t, his conscience according to the universal mora l law, his affections and his soul after the universal law of each, and so he is strong with the strength of God, in this four-fold way communicating with Him. The old theologies, the philosophies of religion of ancient times, will not suffice us now. The duties of life are to be done; we are to do them, consciously obedient to the law of God, not atheisti cally, loving only our selfish gain. There are sins of trade to be corrected. Everywhere morality and philanthrop y are needed. There are errors to be mad e way with, and their place supplied with new truths, radiant with the glories of Heaven. There are great wrongs and evils, in Church and State, in domest ic, social, and public life, to be righted and outgrown. Masonr y cannot in our age forsake the broad way of life. She must journey on in the open street, appear in the crowded square, and teach men by her deeds, her life mor e eloquent than any lips. This Degree is chiefl y devoted to TOLERATION; and it inculcates in the strongest m anner that great leading idea of the Ancient Art, that a belief in the one True God, and a moral and virtuous life, constitute the only religious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Mason.

It sees with the eye of memory the ruthless exter mination of all the people of all sexes and ages, because it was their misfortun e not to know the God of the Hebrews, or to wor ship Him under the wrong name, by the savage troops of Mo ses and Joshua. It sees the thumb- screws and the racks, the whip, the gallows, and the stake, the victims of Diocletian and Alva, the miserabl e Covenanters, the Non-Conformists, Servetus burned, and the unoffending Quaker hung. It sees Cranmer hold his arm, now no longer erring, in the flame until the hand drops off in the consuming heat.

And it sees also the oppression still practised in the nam e of religion – men shot in a Christian jail in Christian Italy for reading the Christian Bible; in almost every Christian State, laws forbidding freedo m of speech on matters relating to Christianit y; and the gallows reaching its arm over the pulpit. The fires of Moloch in Syria, the harsh mutil ations in the nam e of Astarte, Cybele, Jehovah; the barbariti es of imper ial Pagan Torturers; the still grosser tormen ts which Roman- Gothic Christians in Italy and Spain heaped on their brother-men ; the fiendish cruelties to which Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, England, Scotland, Ireland, America, have been witnesses, are none too powerful to warn man of the unspeakable evils which follow from mistakes and errors in the ma tter of religion, and especiall y from investing the God of Love with the cruel and vindictive passions of erring humani ty, and making blood to have a sweet savor in his nostrils, and groans of agony to be delicious to his ears. Man never had the right to usurp the unexercised prerogative of God, and condemn and punish another for his belief. Born in a Protestant land, we are of that faith.

Few believe in any religion because the y have exa mined the evidences of its authentici ty, and mad e up a formal judgment, upon weighing the testimon y. Not one man in ten thousand know s anything about the proofs of his faith. We believe what we are taught; and those are most fanatica l who know least of the evidences on which their creed is based. Facts and testimony are not, except in very rare instances, the ground-work of faith. It is an imperative law of God's Econom y, unyielding and inflexible as Himself, that man shall accept without question the belief of those among whom he is born and reared; the faith so made a part of his nature resists all evidence to the contrar y; and he will disbelieve even the evidence of his own sen ses, rather than yield up the religious belief which has gro wn up in him, flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.

And yet he is both . His reason is as perfect as mine, and he is as honest as I. The fancies of a lunatic are realities, to him . Our dreams are realities while they last , and, in the Past, no more unreal than what we have acted in our waking hours. No man can say that he hath as sure pos session of the truth as of a chattel. When men enterta in opinions diametrically opposed to each other, and each is honest, who s hall decide which hath the Truth; and how can either say with certaint y that he hath it? We know not what is the truth. That we ourselves believe and feel absolutel y certain that our own belief is true, is in reality not the slightest proof of the fact, seem it never so certain and incapable of doubt to us. No man is responsible for the rightness of his faith; but onl y for the up rightness of it. Therefore no man hath or ever had a right to persecute another for his belief; for there cannot be two antagonisti c rights; and if one can persecute another, because he himself is satisfied that the belief of that other is erroneous, the other has, for the same reason, equally as certain a right to persecute him. The truth comes to us tinged and colored with our prejudices and our preconceptions, which are as old as ourselves, and strong with a divine force. It comes to us as the image of a rod comes to us through the water, bent and distorted. An argumen t sinks into and convinces the mind of one man, while from that of another it rebounds like a ball of ivor y dropped on marble. It is no meri t in a man to have a particular faith, excellen t and sound and philosophic as it may be, when he imb ibed it with his moth er's milk. It is no more a merit than his prejudices and his passions. The sincere Moslem has as much right to persecute us, as we to persecute him; and therefore Masonry wisely requires no more than a belief in One Great All-Powerful Deit y, the Father and Preserver of the Universe. Therefore it is she teaches her votaries that toleration is one of the chief duties of ever y good Ma son, a component part of that charity without which we are mere hollow images of true Mason s, mere sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. No evil hath so afflicted the world as intoleran ce of religious opinion. The human beings it has slain in various wa ys, if once and together brought to life, would make a nation of people; left to live and increase, would have doubled the population of the civili zed portion of the globe; among which civilized portion it chiefly is that religious wars are waged. The treasure and the human labor thus lost would have made the earth a garden, in which, but for his evil passions, man might now be as happ y as in Eden.

Every man's opinions are his own private property , and the rights of all men to maintain each his own are perfectl y equal. Merely to tolerate , to bear with an opposing opinion, is to assume it to be heretical ; and assert the right to persecute, if we would; and claim our toleration of it as a merit. The Mason' s creed goes further than that. No man, it holds, has an y right in any way to interfere with the religious belief of another. It holds that each man is absolutel y sovereign as to his own belief, and that belief is a matter absolutel y foreign to all who do not entertain the same belief; and that, if there were any right of persecution at all, it would in all cases be a mutu al right; because one part y has the same right as the other to sit as judge in his own case; and God is she only magistrate that can rightfull y decide between them. To that great Judge, Ma sonry refers the ma tter; and opening wide its portals, it invites to enter there and live in peace and harmon y, the Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew. the Moslem; every man who will lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his brethren, minister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the ONE, All-Powerful, All-Wise, everywhere- Present GOD , Architec t, Creator, and Preserver of all things , by whose universal law of Harmon y ever rolls on this universe, the great, vast, infinite circle of successive Death and Life: – to who se INEFFABLE NA ME let all true Masons pay profoundest hom age! for whose thousand blessings poured upon us, let us feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever! We may well be tolerant of each other's creed; for in every faith there are excell ent moral precepts. Far in the South of Asia, Zoroaster taught this doctrine: \"On com mencing a journey , the Faithful should turn his thoughts toward Ormuzd, and confess him, in the purity of his heart, to be King of the World; he should love him, do him homage, and serve him. He must be upright and charitab le, despise the pleasures of the bod y, and avoid pride and haughtiness, and vice in all its forms, and especiall y falsehood, one of the basest sins of which man can be guilt y. He must forget injuries and not avenge himself. He must honor the memory of his parents and relatives. At night, before retiring to sleep, he should rigorousl y examin e his conscience, and repent of the faults which weakness or ill- fortune had caused him to com mit.\" He was required to pray for strength to persevere in the Good, and to obtain forgiveness for his errors. It was his duty to confess his faults to a Magus, or to a layman renowned for his virtues, or to the Sun. Fasting and mac eration were prohibited; and, on the contrar y, it was his duty suitabl y to nourish the body and to maintain its vigor, that his soul might be strong to resist the Genius of Darkness; that he might more attentive ly read the Divine Word, and have more courage to perform noble deeds. And in the North of Europe the Druids taught devotion to friends, indulgence for reciprocal wrongs, love of deserved praise, prudence, humani ty, hospitalit y, respect for old age, disregard of the future, temperance, contem pt of death, and a chivalrous deference to woman. Listen to these max ims from the Hava Maal, or Sublime Book of O din: \"If thou hast a friend, visit hi m often; the path will grow over with grass, and the trees soon cover it, if thou dost not constantl y walk upon it. He is a faithful friend, who, having but two loaves, gives his friend one. Be never first to break with th y friend; sorrow w rings the heart of him who has no one save himself with whom to take counsel.

Riches flit away in the twinkling of an ey e; they are the most inconstant of friends; flocks and herds perish, parents die, friends are not immortal, thou thy self diest; I know but one thing that cloth not die, the judgment that is passed upon the dead. Be humane toward those whom thou mee test on the road. If the guest that cometh to thy house is a-cold, give him fire; the man who has jo urneyed over the mountains needs food and dr y garments.

The more one learns, the mor e he acquires the faculty of learning. Knowledge is the most permanent wealth. As well be dumb as ignorant. The true use of knowledge is to distinguish good from evil. Be not a subject of shame to thy parents. What one learns in youth endures like the engraving upon a rock. He is wise who know s himse lf. Let thy books be th y best friends. When thou attainest an hundred years, cease to learn. Wisdom is solidl y planted, even on the shifting ocean. Deceive no one, not even thine enemy. Wisdom is a treasure that everywhere commands its value. Speak mildly, even to the poor. It is sweeter to forgive than to take vengeance. Gaming and quarrels lead to misery. There is no true merit without the practice of virtue. To honor our mother is the most fitting homage we can pa y the Divinit y. There is no tranquil sleep without a clear conscience. He badl y understands his interest who breaks his word.\" Twenty-four centuries ago these were the Chinese Ethics: \"The Philosopher [Confucius] said, 'SAN! my doctrine is simple, and eas y to be understood.' THSENG-TSEU replied, 'that is certain.' The Philosopher having gone out, the disciples asked what their master had mean t to say. THSENG-TSEU responded, 'The doctrine of our Master consists s olely in being upright of heart, and loving our neighbor as we love ourself.'\" About a century later, the Hebrew law said, \"If an y man hate his neighbor... then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother... Better is a neighbor that is near, than a brother afar off... Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" In the same fifth century before Christ, SOCRATES the Grecian said, \"Thou shalt love th y neighbor as thyself.\" Page 124 of 621"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Three generations earlier, ZOROASTER had said to the Persians: \"Offer up thy grateful prayers to the Lord, the most just and pure Ormuzd, the supreme and adorable Cod, who thus declared to his Prophet Zerdusht: 'Hold it not meet to do unto others what thou wouldst not desire done unto thyself; do that unto the people, which, when done to thyself, is not disagreeable unto thee.'\" The same doctrine had been long taught in the schools of Bab ylon, Alexandria, and Jerusalem . A Pagan declared to the Pharisee HILLEL, that he was ready to embr ace the Jewish religion, if he could mak e known to him in a few words a summ ary of the whole law of Moses. \"That which thou likest not done to th yself,\" said Hillel, \"do it not unto thy neighbor. Therein is all the law: the rest is nothing but the commentary upon it.\" \"Nothing is more natural,\" said CONFUCIUS, \"nothing mor e simple, than the principles of that morality which I endeavor, by salutar y maxims, to inculcate in you... It is humanit y; which is to say , that universal charity among all of our species, without distinction. It is uprightness; that is, that rectitude of spirit and of heart, which m akes one seek for truth in everything, and desire it, without deceiving one's self or others. It is, finall y, sincerit y or good faith; which is to sa y, that frankness, that openness of heart, te mpered by self- reliance, which excludes all feints and all disguising, as much in speech as in action.\" To diffuse useful inform ation, to further intellec tual refinem ent, sure forerunner of moral improvement, to hasten the coming of the great day, when the dawn of general knowledge shall chase awa y the lazy, lingering mists of ignorance and error, even from the base of the great social pyramid, is indeed a high calling, in which the most splendid talents and consum mate virtue may well press onward, eager to bear a part. From the Masonic ranks ought to go forth those whose genius and not their ancestr y ennoble the m, to open to all ranks the temple of science, and by their own examp le to make the humbl est men emulous to climb steps no longer inaccessible, and enter the unfolded gates burning in the sun. The highest intel lectual cultiva tion is perfectl y compa tible with the daily cares and toils of working-men. A keen relish for the most sublime truths of science belongs alike to every class of m ankind. And, as philosophy was taught in the sacred groves of Athens, and under the Portico, and in the old Temp les of Egypt and India, so in our Lodges ought Knowledge to be dispensed, the Sciences taught, and the Lectures become like the teachings of Socrates and Plato, of Agassiz and Cou sin. Real knowledge never perm itted either turbulence or unbelief; but its progres s is the forerunner of liberalit y and enlightened toleration. Whoso dreads these ma y well tremble; for he may be well assured that their day is at length come, and must put to speed y flight the evil spirits of tyranny and persecution, which haunted the long night now gone down the sky. And it is to be hoped that the time will soon arrive, when, as men will no longer suffer the mselves to be led blindfolded in ignorance, so will the y no more yield to the vile principle of judging and treating their fellow- creatures, not according to the intrinsic merit of their actions, but according to the acciden tal and involuntar y coincidenc e of their opinions.

The Elu of Fifteen ought therefore to take the lead of his fellow- citizen, not in frivolous amusements, not in the degrading pursuits of the ambitious vulgar; but in the trul y noble task of enlightening the mass of his country men, and of leaving his own name encircled, not with barbaric splendor, or attached to courtl y gewgaws, but illustrated by the honors most worthy of our rational nature; coupled with the diffusion of knowledge, and gratefull y pronounced b y a few, at least, whom his wise beneficence has rescued from ignorance and vice.

A nd if the benefactors of mank ind, when the y rest from their noble labors, shall be permi tted to enjoy hereafter, as an appropriate reward of their virtue, the privilege of looking down upon the blessings with which their exertions and charities, and perhaps their toils and sufferings have clothed the scene of their former existence, it will not, in a state of exalted purity and wisdom, be the founders of migh ty dynasties, the conquerors of new emp ires, the Cæsars, Alexanders, and Tamerlanes; nor the mere Kings and Counsellors, Presidents and Senators, who have lived for their party chiefly, and for their country only incidenta lly, often sacrificing to their own aggrandize ment or that of their faction the good of their fellow- creatures; – it will not be they who will be gratified by contem plating the monum ents of their inglorious fa me; but those will enjoy that delight and mar ch in that triumph, who can trace the remo te effects of their enlightened benevolence in the i mproved condition of their species, and exult in the reflection, that the change which they at last, perhaps after many years, survey , with eyes that age and sorro w can make dim no more, – of Kno wledge becom e Power, – Virtue sharing that Empire, – Superstition dethroned, and Ty ranny exiled, is, if even onl y in some small and ver y slight degree, yet still in some degree, the fruit, precious if costly, and though late repaid yet long enduring, of their own self-denial and strenuous exertion, of their own mit e of charit y and aid to education wisely bestowed, and of the hard-ships and hazards which they encountered here below. Masonry requires of its Initiates and votaries nothing that is impra cticable. It does not demand that they should undertake to climb to those loft y and sublime peaks of a theoreti cal and imag inary unpractic al virtue, high and cold and remote as the eternal snows that wrap the shoulders of Chimborazo, and at least as in- accessible as they . It asks that alone to be done which is eas y to be done. It overtasks no one' s strength, and asks no one to go bey ond his means and capacities. It does not expect one whose business or profes sion yields him little more than the wants of himse lf and his fam ily require, and whose time is necessaril y occupied by his dail y vocations, to abandon or neglect the business by which he and his children live, and devote himself and his means to the diffusion of knowledge Page 126 of 621"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike among men. It does not expect him to publish books for the people, or to lecture, to the ruin of his private affairs, or to found academ ies and colleges, build up libraries, and entitle himself to statues. But it does require and expect every man of us to do some thing, within and according to his means; and there is no Mason w ho cannot do some thing, if not alone, then by combination and association. If a Lodge cannot aid in founding a school or an academ y it can still do some thing. It can educate one boy or girl, at least, the child of some poor or departed brother. And it should never be forgotten, that in the poorest unregarded child that seems abandoned to ignorance and vice may slumber the virtues of a Socrates, the intell ect of a Bacon or a Bo ssuet, the genius of a Shakespeare, the capacit y to benefit mankind of a Washington; and that in rescuing him from the mire in which he is plunged, and giving him the means of education and developmen t, the Lodge that does it may be the direct and imm ediate means of conferring upon the world as great a boon as that given it by John Faust the boy of Mentz; may perpetuate the liberties of a country and change the destinies of nations, and write a new chapter in the histor y of the world. For we never know the importan ce of the act we do. The daughter of Pharaoh litt le thought what she was doing for the human race, and the vast uni maginab le consequences that depended on her charitab le act, when she drew the litt le child of a Hebrew woman from among the rushes that grew along the bank of the Nile, and determ ined to rear it as if it were her own. How often has an act of charit y, costing the doer little, given to the world a great painter, a great musician, a great inventor! How often has such an act developed the ragged bo y into the benefactor of his race! On what small and apparentl y unimportan t circumstances have turned and hinged the fates of the world's great conquerors. There is no law that limits the returns that shall be reaped from a single good deed. The widow' s mite may not onl y be as acceptab le to God, but may produce as great results as the rich man's costly offering. The poorest boy, helped b y benevolence, may come to lead armies, to control senates, to decide on peace and war, to dictate to cabinets; and his magnifi cent thoughts and noble words may be law man y years hereafter to millions of men yet unborn. But the opportunit y to effect a great good does not often occur to an y one. It is worse than folly for one to lie idle and inert, and expect the acciden t to befall him, by which his influences shall live forever. He can expect that to happen, only in consequence of one or many or all of a long series of acts. He can expect to benefit the world only as men attain other results; b y continuanc e, by persistence, by a stead y and uniform habit of laboring for the enlightenm ent of the world, to the extent of his means and capacit y. For it is, in all instances, by steady labor, by giving enough of application to our work, and having enough of ti me for the doing of it, by regular pains-taking, and the plying of constant assiduities, and not by any process of legerdem ain, that we secure the strength and the staple of real excellence. It was thus that Demosthenes, clause after clause, and sentence after sentence, elaborated to the uttermost his immortal orations. It was thus that Page 127 of 621"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Newton pioneered his way, by the steps of an ascending geometr y, to the mechan ism of the Heavens, and Le Verrier added a planet to our Solar S ystem. It is a most erroneous opinion that those who have left the most stupendous monu ments of intellect behind the m, were not differentl y exercised from the rest of the species, but only differentl y gifted; that they signalized themse lves only by their talent, and hardl y ever by their industr y; for it is in truth to the most strenuous application of those com monplace faculties which are diffused among all, that they are indebted for the glories which now encircle their remembrance and their name. We must not imagine it to be a vulgarizing of genius, that it should be lighted up in any other way than by a direct inspiration from Heaven; nor overlook the steadfastness of purpose, the devotion to some single but great object, the unweariedness of labor that is given, not in convulsive and preternatural throes, but b y little and litt le as the strength of the mind may bear it; the accu mulation of man y small efforts, instead of a few grand and gigantic, but perhaps irregular movements, on the part of energies that are marvellous; by which former alone the great results are brought out that write their enduring records on the face of the earth and in the histor y of nations and of man. We must not overlook these elemen ts, to which genius o wes the best and proudest of her achieve ments; nor imagin e that qualities so generall y possessed as patience and pains- taking, and resolute industr y, have no share in upholding a distinction so illustrious as that of the benefactor of his kind. We must not forget that great results are most ordinaril y produced by an aggregate of man y contributions and exertions; as it is the invisible particles of vapor, each separate and distinct from the other, that, rising from the oceans and their bays and gulfs, from lakes and rivers, and wide morasses and overflowed plains, float away as clouds, and distill upon the earth in dews, and fall in showers and rain and sno ws upon the broad plains and rude mountains, and make the great navigable streams that are the arteries along which flows the life-blood of a countr y. And so Ma sonry can do much, if each Mason be content to do his s hare, and if their united efforts are directed by wise counsels to a com mon purpose. \"It is for God and for Omnipot ency to do might y things in a moment; but by degrees to grow to greatness is the course that He hath left for man.\" If Masonry will but be true to her mission, and Ma sons to their promises and obligations – if, re-entering vigorousl y upon a career of beneficence, she and they will but pursue it earnestl y and unfalteringl y, remembering that our contributions to the cause of charit y and education then deserve the greatest credit when it costs us s omething, the curtail ing of a comfort or the relinquishm ent of a luxury , to make them – if we will but give aid to what were once Masonry 's great schemes for human improve ment, not fitfully and spasmodic ally, but regularl y and incessantl y, as the vapors rise and the springs run, and as the sun rise s and the stars com e up into the heavens, then we ma y be sure that great results will be attained and a great work done.

The people that does not sub jugate the propensit y of the wealth y to avarice, ambition, and sensualit y, expel luxury from them and their families, keep down pauperis m, diffuse knowledge among the poor, and labor to raise the abject from the mire of vice and low indulgence, and to keep the industrious from starving in sight of luxurious festivals, will find that it has cherished, in that avarice, ambition, sensualit y, selfishness, and luxury of the one class, and that degradation, misery, drunkenness, ignorance, and brutalizat ion of the other, mor e stubborn and intract able despots at home than it ever encountered in the field; and even its very bowels will be continuall y teeming with the intolerabl e progen y of tyrants.

Unfortunatel y, every age presents its own s pecial problem, most difficult and often impossibl e to solve; and that which this age offers, and forces upon the consideration of all thinking men, is this – how, in a populous and wealth y country , blessed with free institutions and a constitutiona l governm ent, are the great masses of the manual- labor class to be enabled to have steady work at fair wages, to be kept from starvation, and their children from vice and debaucher y, and to be furnished with that degree, not of mer e reading and writing, but of knowledge , that shall fit them intelligently to do the duties and exercise the privileges of freem en; even to be intrusted with the dangerous right of suffrage? For though we do not know why God, being infinite ly merciful as well as wise, has so ordered it, it seems to be unquestionabl y his law, that even in civiliz ed and Christian countries, the large mass of the population shall be fortunate, if, during their whole life, from infancy to old age, in health and sickness, the y have enough of the com monest and coarsest food to keep themselves and their children from the continual gnawing of hunger – enough of the com monest and coarsest clothing to protect themselv es and their little ones from indecent exposure and the bitter cold; and if they have over their heads the rudest shelter. And He seems to have enacted this law – w hich no human community has yet found the means to abrogate – that when a countr y becomes populous, capital shall concentrate in the hands of a li mited number of persons, and labor beco me more and more at its mercy, until mere manua l labor, that of the weaver and iron-worker, and other artisans, eventuall y ceases to be worth more than a bare sub sistence, and often, in great cities and vast extents of countr y, not even that, and goes or crawls about in rags, begging, and starving for want of work. While every ox and horse can find work, and is worth being fed, it is not always so with man. To be e mployed, to have a chance to work at an ything like fair wages, becomes the great engrossing object of a m an's life. The capitalist can live without employing the laborer, and discharges him whenever that labor ceases to be profitable. At the mo ment when the weather is most inclem ent, provisions dearest, and rents highest, he turns him off to starve. if the day-laborer is taken sick, his wages stop. When old, he has no pension to retire upon. His children cannot be sent to school; for before their bones are hardened they must get to work lest they starve. The man, strong and able- bodied, works for a shilling or two a day, and the woman shivering over her little pan of coals, when the mercur y drops far below zero, after her hungr y children have wailed themse lves to sleep, sews by the dim light of her lonely candle, for a bare pittanc e, selling her life to him who bargained only for the work of her needle.

How to deal with this apparentl y inevitable evil and mort al disease is by far the most important of all social problems. What is to be done with pauperis m and over- supply of labor? Ho w is the life of any country to last, when brutalit y and drunken semi-barbaris m vote, and hold offices in their gift, and by fit representatives of themselves control a governm ent? How, if not wisdom and authorit y, but turbulence and low vice are to exalt to senatorships m iscreants reeking with the odors and pollution of the hell, the prize-ring, the brothel, and the stock-exchange, where ga mbling is legalized and rascalit y is laudable? Masonry will do all in its power, b y direct exertion and co-operation, to improve and inform as well as to protect the people; to better their physical condition, relieve their miseries, supply their wants, and min ister to their necessities. Let every Mason in this good work do all that may be in his power. For it is true now, as it always was and always will be, that to be free is the same thing as to be pious, to be wise, to be temp erate and just, to be frugal and abstinent, and to be magnanimous and brave; and to be the opposite of all these is the same as to be a slave. And it usually happens, b y the appointm ent, and, as it were, retributive justice of the Deit y, that that people which cannot govern the mselves, and moderat e their passions, but crouch under the slaver y of their lusts and vices, are delivered up to the sway of those whom they abhor, and made to submit to an involuntar y servitude. And it is also sanctioned by the dictates of justice and by the constitution of Nature, that he who, from the imbecility or derange ment of his intelle ct, is incapabl e of governing himself, should, like a minor, be com mitted to the govern ment of another. Above all things let us never forget that mankind constitutes one great brotherhood; all born to encounter suffering and sorrow, and therefore bound to s ympathize with each other. For no tower of Pride was ever yet high enough to lift its possessor above the trials and fears and fragilities of humanit y. No human hand ever built the wall, nor ever shall, that will keep out affliction, pain, and infir mity. Sickness and sorrow, trouble and death, are dispensations that level everything. They know none, high nor low. The chief wants of life, the great and grave necessities of the human soul, give exe mption to none. The y make all poor, all weak. The y put supplication in the mouth of ever y human being, as truly as in that of the meanest beggar. But the principle of miser y is not an evil principle. We err, and the consequences teach us wisdom. All elements, all the laws of things around us, minister to this end; and through the paths of painful error and mistake, it is the design of Providence to lead us to truth and Page 133 of 621"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike happiness. If erring only taught us to err; if mistakes confirm ed us in imprud ence; if the miseries caused by vicious indulgence had a natural tendenc y to make us more abject slaves of vice, then suffering would be wholl y evil. But, on the contrary , all tends and is designed to produce amendm ent and improve ment. Suffering is the discipline of virtue; of that which is infinit ely better than happiness, and yet embraces in itself all essential happiness. It nourishes, invigorates, and perfects it. Virtue is the prize of the severel y- contested race and hard- fought battle; and it is worth all the fatigue and wounds of the conflict. Man should go forth with a brave and strong heart, to battle with cala mity. He is to master it, and not let it beco me his mast er. He is not to forsake the post of trial and of peril; but to stand fir mly in his lot, until the great word of P rovidence shall bid him fly, or bid him sink. With resolution and courage the Mason is to do the work which it is appointed for him to do, looking through the dark cloud of human calamity, to the end that rises high and bright before him. The lot of sorro w is great and sublim e. None suffer forever, nor for nought, nor without purpose. It is the ordinance of God's wisdom, and of His Infinite Love, to procure for us infinite happiness and glor y. Virtue is the truest liberty; nor is he free who stoops to passions; nor he in bondage who serves a noble master. Examp les are the best and most lasting lectures; virtue the best example. He that hath done good deeds and set good precedents, in sincerit y, is happy . Time shall not outlive his worth. He lives trul y after death, whose good deeds are his pillars of remembrance; and no day but adds some grains to his heap of glory . Good w orks are seeds, that after sowing return us a continual harvest; and the memory of noble actions is more enduring than monuments of marbl e. Life is a school. The world is neither prison nor penitent iary, nor a palace of ease, nor an amphitheatre for games and spectacles; but a place of instruction, and discipline. Life is given for moral and spiritual training; and the entire course of the great school of life is an education for virtue, happiness, and a future existence. The periods of Life are its terms; all human conditions, its forms; all human employments, its lessons. Families are the primar y departments of this moral education; the various circles of society, its advanced stages; Kingdoms and Republics, its universities. Riches and Poverty , Gayeties and Sorrow s, Marriages and Funerals, the ties of life bound or broken, fit and fortunate, or untoward and painful, are all lessons. Events are not blindl y and carelessl y flung together. Providence does not school one man, and screen another from the fier y trial of its lessons. It has neither rich favorites nor poor victim s. One event happeneth to all. One end and one design concern and urge all men. The prosperou s man has been at school. Perhaps he has thought that it was a great thing, and he a great personage; but he has been merely a pupil. He thought, perhaps, that he was Master, and had nothing to do, but to direct and com mand; but there was ever a Master above him, the Master of Life. He looks not at our splendid state, or our man y pretensions, nor at the aids and appliances of our learning; but at our learning itself. He puts the poor and the rich upon the same form; and knows no difference between them, but their progress. If from prosperity we have learned moderat ion, temperanc e, candor, modest y, gratitude to God, and generosit y to man, then we are entitled to be honored and rewarded. If we have Page 134 of 621"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike learned selfishness, self-indulgence, wrong-doing, and vice, to forget and overlook our less fortunate brother, and to scoff at the providence of God, then we are unworth y and dishonored, though we have been nursed in affluence, or taken our degrees from the lineage of an hundred noble descents; as truly so, in the eye of Heaven, and of all right- thinking men, as though we la y, victims of beggary and disease, in the hospital, by the hedge, or on the dung-hill. The most ordinar y human equity looks not at the school, but at the scholar; and the equity of Heaven will not look beneath that mark. The poor man also is at school. Let him take care that he learn, rather than comp lain. Let him hold to his integrit y, his candor, and his kindness of heart. Let him beware of envy , and of bondage, and keep his self-respect. The bod y's toil is nothing. Let him beware of the mind's drudger y and degradation. While he betters his condition if he can, let him be more anxious to better his soul. Let him be willing, while poor, and even if always poor, to learn poverty's great lessons, fortitude, cheerfulness, content ment, and impl icit confidence in God's Providence. With these, and patience, calmness, self-com mand, disinterestedness, and affectionate kindness, the humbl e dwelling may be hallowed, and made more dear and noble than the loftiest palace. Let him, above all things, see that he lose not his independence. Let him not cast himse lf, a creature poorer than the poor, an indolent, helpless, despised beggar, on the kindness of others. Ever y man should choose to have God for his Master, rather than man; and escape not from this school, either by dishonest y or alms-taking, lest he fall into that state, worse than disgrace, where he can have no respect for himse lf. The ties of Societ y teach us to love one another. That is a miser able society, where the absence of affectionat e kindness is sought to be supplied by punctilious decorum, graceful urbanity, and polished insincerit y; where ambi tion, jealousy, and distrust rule, in place of simplicity, confidence, and kindness. So, too, the social state teaches modest y and gentleness; and from neglect, and notice unworthil y bestowed on others, and injustice, and the world's failure to appreciate us, we learn patience and quietness, to be superior to society's opinion, not cynical and bitter, but gentle, candid, and affectionate still. Death is the great Teacher, stern, cold, inexorable, irresistible; whom the collect ed might of the world cannot stay or ward off. The breath, that parting from the lips of King or beggar, scarcel y stirs the hushed air, cannot be bought. or brought back for a mo ment, with the wealth of Empires. What a lesson is this, teaching our frailt y and feebleness, and an Infinite Power be yond us! It is a fearful lesson, that never becomes familiar. It walks through the earth in dread mystery, and lays it hands upon all. It is a universal lesson, that is read everywhere and by all men. Its message comes every year and ever y day. The past years are crowded with its sad and solemn mementoes; and death's finger races its handwriting upon the walls of ever y human habitation. It teaches us Duty; to act our part well; to fulfill the work assigned us. When one is dy ing, and after he is dead, there is but one question: Has he lived well ? There is no evil in death but that which life makes. Page 135 of 621"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike There are hard lesson s in the school of God's Providence; and yet the school of life is carefull y adjusted, in all its arrange ments and tasks, to man's powers and passions. There is no extravaganc e in its teachings; nor is an ything done for the sake of present effect. The whole course of human life is a conflict with difficult ies; and, if rightl y conducted, a progress in improv ement. It is never too late for man to learn. Not part only, but the whole, of life is a school. There never comes a time, even amidst the decays of age, when it is fit to lay aside the eagerness of acquisition, or the cheerfulness of endeavor. Man walks, all through the course of life, in patience and strife, and somet imes in darkness; for, from patience is to com e perfection; from strife, triumph is to issue; from the cloud of darkness the lightning is to flash that shall open the wa y to eternit y. Let the Mason be faithful in the school of life, and to all its lessons! Let him not learn nothing, nor care not whether he learns or not. Let not the y ears pass over hi m, witnesses of only his sloth and indifference ; or see hi m zealous to acquire everything but virtue. Nor let him labor onl y for himself ; nor forget that the humbl est man that lives is his brother, and hath a clai m on his sy mpathies and kind offices; and that beneath the rough garmen ts which labor wears ma y beat hearts as noble as throb under the stars of princes. God, who counts by souls, not stations, Loves and pit ies you and me; For to Him all vain di stinctions Are as pebbles on the sea. Nor are the other duties inculcat ed in this Degree of less impor tance. Truth, a Mason is early told, is a Divine attribute and the foundation of ever y virtue; and frankness, reliability, sincerit y, straightforwardness, plain- dealing, are but different modes in which Truth develops itself. The dead, the absent, the innocent, and those that trust him, no Mason will deceive willingl y. To all these he owes a nobler justice, in that they are the most certain trials of human Equity. Only the most abandoned of men, said Cicero, will deceive him, who would have re mained uninjured if he had not trusted. All the noble deeds that have beat their m arches through succeeding ages have proceeded from men of truth and genuine courage. The man who is alway s true is both virtuous and wise; and thus possesses the greatest guards of safety : for the law has not power to strike the virtuous; nor can fortune subvert the wise. The bases of Ma sonry being morality and virtue, it is by studying one and practising the other, that the conduct of a Mason becom es irreproachable. The good of Humani ty being its principal object, disinterestedness is one of the first virtues that it requires of its members; for that is the source of ju stice and beneficence. To pity the misfortunes of others; to be humble, but without meanness; to be proud, but without arrogance; to abjure ever y sentim ent of hatred and revenge; to show himse lf magnanimous and liberal, without ostentation and without profusion; to be the enemy of vice; to pay homage to wisdom and virtue; to respect innocence; to be constant and patient in adversity , and modest in prosperity; to avoid ever y irregularit y that stains the soul and distempers the body – it is b y following these precepts that a Mason will become a good citizen, a faithful husband, a tender father, an obedient son, and a true brother; will honor friendship, and fulfill with ardor the duties which virtue and the social relations impose upon him.

Alas, these conquer, and Ma sonry is forgotten! After praising each other all our lives, there are alwa ys excellent Brethren, who, over our coffins, shower unli mited eulogies. Every one of us who dies, however useless his life, has been a model of all the virtues, a very child of the celestia l light. In Egypt, among our old Masters, where Masonry was more cultivat ed than vanity, no one could gain admittance to the sacred as ylum of the to mb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment. A grave tribunal sat in judgment upon all, even the kings. They said to the dead. \"Whoever thou art, give account to thy country of thy actions! What hast thou done with th y time and life? The law interrogat es thee, thy country hears thee, Truth sits in judgment on thee!\" Princes came there to be judged, escorted onl y by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted, the history of the dead man's life, and threw the blaze of the torch of truth .on all his actions. If it were adjudged that he had led an evil life, his m emory was condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. What a lesson the old Masonry taught to the sons of the people! Is it true that Masonry is effete; that the acacia, withered, affords no shade; that Masonry no longer marches in the advance- guard of Truth? N o. Is freedom yet universal? Have ignorance and prejudice disappeared from the earth? Are there no longer enm ities among men? Do cupidit y and falsehood no longer exist? Do toleration and harmon y prevail among religious and politica l sects? There are works yet left for Ma sonry to accomp lish, greater than the twelve labors of Hercules; to advance ever resolutel y and steadily; to enlighten the minds of the people, to reconstruct society, to reform the laws, and to improve the public morals. The eternity in front of it is as infinite as the one behind. And Masonry cannot cease to labor in the cause of social progress, without ceasing to be true to itself, without ceasing to be Masonry .

[Master Architect.] THE great duties that are inculca ted by the lessons taught by the working-instrum ents of a Grand Master Architect, demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capaci ty to perform them faithfull y and fully, bring us at once to reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers and capacit ies of the human soul; and to that theme we invite your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from earth toward the Stars. Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward God, and the Infinite. It is especiall y so in its afflict ions. Words go but a littl e way into the depths of sorrow. The thoughts that writhe there in silence, that go into the stillness of Infinitude and Eternit y, have no emble ms. Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered. They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help. There is a loneliness in deep sorro w which the Deit y alone can relieve. Alone, the mind wrestles with the great problem of calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence of Heaven, and thus is led directly to God. There are many things in us of w hich we are not distinctl y conscious: To waken that slumber ing consciousness into life, and so to lead the soul up to the Light, is one office of every great ministra tion to human nature, whether its vehicle be the pen, the pencil, or the tongue. We are unconscious of the intensit y and awfulness of the life within us. Health and sickness, joy and sorrow, success and disappoint ment, life and death, love and loss, are familiar words upon our lips; and we do not know to what depths the y point within us. We seem never to know w hat any thing m eans or is worth until we have lost it. Man y an organ, nerve, and fibre in our bodil y frame performs its silent part for years, and we are quite unconscious of its value. It is not until it is injured that we discover that value, and find how essential it was to our happiness and comfor t. We never know the full significance of the words, \"property ,\" \"ease,\" and \"health;\" the wealth of mean ing in the fond epithets, \"parent,\" \"child,\" \"beloved,\" and \"friend,\" until the thing or the person is Page 139 of 621"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike taken away; until, in place of the bright, visible being, comes the awful and desolate shadow, where nothing is: where we stretch out our hands in vain, and strain our eyes upon dark and dismal vacuity. Yet, in that vacuity, we do not lose the object that we loved. It becomes only the more real to us. Our blessings not onl y brighten when the y depart, but are fixed in enduring realit y; and love and friendship receive their everlasting seal under the cold impress of death. A dim consciousnes s of infinite mystery and grandeur lies beneath all the commonplace of life. There is an awfulness and' a majest y around us, in all our little worldliness. The rude peasant from the Apennines, asleep at the foot of a pillar in a majestic Roman church, seems not to hear or see, but to drea m only of the herd he feeds or the ground he tills in the mountains. But the choral symphonies fall softly upon his ear, and the gilded arches are dimly seen through his half-slumber ing eyelids. So the soul, however given up to the occupations of daily life, cannot quite lose the sense of where it is, and of what is above it and around it. The scene of its actual engagem ents may be smal l; the path of its steps, beaten and fam iliar; the objects it handles, easily spanned, and quite worn out with dail y uses. So it may be, and amidst such things that we all live. So we live our little life; but Heaven is above us and all around and close to us; and Eternit y is before us and behind us; and suns and stars are silent witnesses and watchers over us. We are enfolded b y Infinity. Infinite Powers and Infinite spaces lie all around us. The dread arch of Mystery spreads over us, and no voice ever pierced it. Eternity is enthroned amid Heaven' s myriad starry heights; and no utterance or word ever came from those far-off and silent spaces. Above, is that awful majesty; around us, everywhere, it stretches off into infinity; and beneath it is this little struggle of life, this poor da y's conflict, this busy ant-hill of Tim e. But from that ant-hill, not only the talk of the streets, the sounds of music and revelling, the stir and tread of a multitude, the shout of joy and the shriek of agon y go up into the silent and all- surrounding Infinitude; but also, amidst the stir and noise of visible life, from the inmost bosom of the visible man, there goes up an imploring call, a beseeching cry, an asking, unuttered, and unutterable, for revelation, wailingl y and in al most speechless agony praying the dread arch of m ystery to break, and the stars that roll above the waves of mortal trouble, to speak; the enthroned majesty of those awful heights to find a voice; the mysterious and reserved heavens to com e near; and all to tell us what they alone know; to give us informat ion of the loved and lost; to make known to us what we are, and whither we are going. Man is enco mpassed with a dom e of incompr ehensibl e wonders. In him and about him is that which should fill his life with majesty and sacredness. Someth ing of sublim ity and sanctity has thus flashed down from heaven into the heart of every one that lives. There is no being so base and abandoned but hath some traits of that sacredness left upon him; something, so much perhaps in discordance with his general repute, that he hides it from all around hi m; some sanctuary in his soul, where no one ma y enter; some sacred inclosure, where the memory of a child is, or the image of a venerated parent, or the remembrance of a pure love, or the echo of some word of kindness once spoken to him; an echo that will never die awa y.

Our steps are evermore haunted with thoughts, far be yond their own range, which some have regarded as the reminiscences of a pre-existent state. So it is with us all, in the beaten and worn track of this worldl y pilgrimage. There is more here, than the world we live in. It is not all of life to live. An unseen and infinite presence is here; a sense of something greater than we posses s; a seeking, through all the void wastes of life, for a good bey ond it; a crying out of the heart for interpret ation; a memory, of the dead, touching continual ly some vibrating thread in this great tissue of mystery. We all not onl y have better intimations, but are capable of better things than we know. The pressure of some great emergency would develop in us powers, bey ond the worldly bias of our spirits; and Heaven so deals with us, from time to time, as to call forth those better things, There is hardl y a family in the world so selfish, but that, if one in it were doomed to die – one, to be selected by the others, – it would be utterl y impossible for its me mbers, parents and children, to choose out that victim; but that each would say , \"I will die; but I cannot choose.\" And in how man y, if that dire extre mity had co me, would not one and another step forth, freed from the vile meshes of ordinar y selfishness, and say , like the Roman father and son, \"Let the blow fall on me!\" There are greater and better things in us all, than the world takes account of, or than we take note of; if we would but find them out. And it is one part of our Masonic culture to find these traits of power and sublime devotion, to revive these faded i mpressions of generosity and self-sacrifice, the almost squandered bequests of God 's love and kindness to our souls; and to induce us to y ield ourselves to their guidance and control. Upon all conditions of men presses down one impar tial law, To all situations, to all fortunes, high or low, the mind gives their charact er. They are, in effect, not what the y are in themselv es, but what the y are to the feeling of their possessors. The King ma y be mean, degraded, miserab le; the slave of ambi tion, fear, voluptuousness, and ever y low pas sion. The Peasant ma y be the real Monarch, the mora l master of his fate, a free and loft y being, more than a Prince in happiness, more than a King in honor. Man is no bubble upon the sea of his fortunes, helpless and irrespon sible upon the tide of events. Out of the same circums tances, different men bring totally different results. The same difficult y, distress, povert y, or misfortune, that breaks down one man, builds up another and mak es him strong. It is the ver y attribute and glory of a man, that he can bend the circums tances of his condition to the intellec tual and moral purposes of his nature, and it is the power and master y of his will that chiefly distinguish him from the brute. The faculty of moral will, developed in the child, is a new elem ent of his nature. It is a new power brought upon the scene, and a ruling power, delegated from Heaven. Never was a human being sunk so low that he had not, by God's gift, the power to rise, Because God commands him to rise, it is certain that he can rise, Every man has the power, and should use it, to mak e all situations, trials, and temp tations instrumen ts to promot e his virtue and happiness; and is so far from being the creature of circumst ances, that he creates and controls them , making them to be all that they are, of evil or of good, to him as a moral being.

The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation ; but ver y different are the aspects which it bears to them. To the one, it is all beauty and gladness; the waves of ocean roll in light, and the mount ains are covered with day. Life, to him, flashes, rejoicing, upon ever y flower and every tree that trembles in the breeze. There is more to him, everywhere, than the eye sees; a presence of profound joy on hill and valle y, and bright, dancing water. The other idly or mournfull y gazes at the same scene, and ever ything wears a dull, dim, and sickly aspect. The mur muring of the brooks is a discord to him, the great roar of the sea has an angr y and threatening emphasis, the solemn music of the pines sing s the requiem of his departed happiness; the cheerful light shines garishl y upon his e yes and offends hi m. The great train of the seasons pas ses before him like a funeral procession; and he sighs, and turns impat iently away. The eye makes that which it looks upon; the ear makes its own melodies and discords; the world without reflects the world within. Let the Mason never forget that life and the world are what we make them by our social character ; by our adaptation, or want of adaptation to the social conditions, relationships, and pursuits of the world. To the selfish, the cold, and the insensible, to the haught y and presuming, to the proud, w ho demand more than the y are likely to receive, to the jealous, ever afraid they shall not receive enough, to those who are unreasonabl y sensitive about the good or ill opinions of others, to all violators of the social laws, the rude, the violent, the dishonest, and the sensual, – to all these, the social condition, from its very nature, will present annoyances, disappoint ments, and pains, appropriate to their several characters. The benevolent affections will not revolve around selfishness; the cold- hearted must expect to meet coldness; the proud, haughtiness; the passionate, anger; and the violent, rudeness. Those who forget the rights of others, must not be surprised if their own are forgotten; and those who stoop to the lowest embrac es of sense must not wonder, if others are not concerned to find their prostrate honor, and lift it up to the rem embrance and respect of the world. To the gentle, many will be gentle; to the kind, many will be kind. A good man will find that there is goodness in the world; an honest man will find that there is honesty in the world; and a man of principle will find principle and integrit y in the m inds of others. There are no blessings w hich the mind may not convert into the bitterest of evils; and no trials which it may not transform into the noblest and divinest blessings. There are no temptations from which assailed virtue may not gain strength, instead of falling before them, vanquished and subdued. It is true that temptations have a great power, and virtue often falls; but the might of these te mptations lies not in the mselves, but in the feebleness of our own virtue, and the weaknes s of our own hearts. We rel y too much on the strength of our ramp arts and bastions, and allow the enemy to mak e his approaches, by trench and parallel, at his leisure. The offer of dishonest gain and guilt y pleasure makes the honest man more honest, and the pure man more pure. The y raise his virtue to the height of towering indignation. The fair occasion, the safe opportunit y, the tempting chance become the defeat and disgrace of the tempter.

The busines s of the world absorbs, corrupts, and degrades one mind, while in another it feeds and nurses the noblest independenc e, integrit y, and generosit y. Pleasure is a poison to some, and a healthful refreshment to others. To one, the world is a great harmon y, like a noble strain of musi c with infinite modula tions; to another, it is a huge factor y, the clash and clang of whose mach inery jars upon his ears and frets him to madn ess. Life is substantiall y the same thing to all who partake of its lot. Yet some rise to virtue and glory ; while others, undergoing the same discipline, and enjoying the same privileges, sink to shame and perdition. Thorough, faithful, and honest endeavor to improve, is alwa ys successful, and the highest happiness. To sigh sentimen tally over hum an misfortune, is fit only for the mind's childhood; and the m ind's miser y is chiefl y its own fault; appointed, under the good Providence of God, as the punisher and corrector of its fault. In the long run, the mind will be happy, just in proportion to its fidelity and wisdom.

A certain kind and degree of spirituality enter into the largest part of even the most ordinar y life. You can carry on no business, without some faith in man. You cannot even dig in the ground, without a relianc e on the unseen result. You cannot think or reason or even step, without confiding in the inward, s piritual principles of your nature. All the affections and bonds, and hopes and interests of life centre in the spiritual ; and you know that if that central bond were broken, the world would rush to chaos. Believe that there is a God; that He is our father; that He has a paternal interest in our welfare and improv ement; that He has given us powers, b y means of which we may escape from sin and ruin; that He has destined us to a future life of endless progress toward perfection and a knowledge of Himself – believe this, as every Mason should, and y ou can live calmly, endure patient ly, labor resolutel y, deny yourselves cheerfull y, hope steadfastl y, and be conquerors in the great struggle of life. Take away any one of these principles, and what remains for us?

The religious faith thus taught by Masonry is indispensable to the attain ment of the great ends of life; and must therefore have been designed to be a part of it. We are made for this faith; and there must be someth ing, somewhere, for us to believe in. We cannot grow healthful ly, nor live happily, without it. It is therefore true . If we could cut off from any soul all the principles taught by Masonry, the faith in a God, in immortality, in virtue, in essential rectitud e, that soul would sink into sin, miser y, darkness, and ruin. If we could cut off all sense of these truths, the m an would sink at once to the grade of the ani mal.

The religion we teach is therefore as reall y a principle of things, and as certain and true, as gravitation. Faith in mora l principles, in virtue, and in God, is as necessary for the guidance of a man, as instinct is for the guidance of an ani mal. And therefore this faith, as a principle of man's nature, has a mission as truly authentic in God' s Providence, as the principle of instinct. The pleasures of the soul, too, must depend on certain principles. They must recognize a soul, its properties and respon sibilities, a conscience, and the sense of an authorit y above us; and these are the principles of faith. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improv e and be happy, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must of necessit y embrace the great truths taught by Masonry , and live by them, to live happily.

God has ordained that life shall be a social state. We are me mbers of a civil community. The life of that community depends upon its moral condition. Public spirit, intelligence, uprightness, temperan ce, kindness, domest ic purity, will make it a happy community, and give it prosperity and continuanc e. Widespread selfishness, dishonesty , intemperan ce, libertinism, corruption, and cri me, will mak e it miserabl e, and bring about dissolution and speedy ruin. A whole people lives one life; one might y heart heaves in its bosom; it is one great pulse of existence that throbs there. One strea m of life flows there, with ten thousand intermingled branches and channels, through all the homes of human love. One sound as of many waters, a rapturous jubilee or a mournful sighing, com es up from the congregated dwellings of a whole nation. The Public is no vague abstraction; nor should that which is done against that Public, against public interest, law, or virtue, press but lightl y on the conscience. It is but a vast expansion of individual life; an ocean of tears, an at mosphere of sighs, or a great whole of joy and gladness. It suffers with the suffering of mi llions; it rejoices with the joy of millions. What a vast crim e does he com mit, – private man or public man, agent or contractor, legislator or mag istrate, secretar y or president, – who dares, with indignit y and wrong, to strike the bosom of the Public Welfare, to encourage venalit y and corruption, and shameful sale of the elect ive franchise, or of office; to sow dissension, and to weaken the bonds of amit y that bind a Nation together! What a huge iniquit y, he who, with vices like the daggers of a parricide, dares to pierce that mighty heart, in which the ocean of existence is flowing! What an unequalled interest lies in the virtue of ever y one whom we love! In his virtue, nowhere but in his virtue, is garnered up the inco mparab le treasure. What care we for brother or friend, co mpared with what we care for his honor, his fidelit y, his reputation, his kindness? How venerable is the rectitude of a parent! How sacred his reputation! No blight that can fall upon a child, is like a parent's dishonor. Heathen or Christian, every, parent would have his child do well; and pours out upon him all the fullness of parental love, in the one desire that he may do well; that he may be worthy of his cares, and his freel y bestowed pains; that he may walk in the way of honor and happiness. In that way he cannot walk one step without virtue. Such is life, in its relationships. A thousand ties embrac e it, like the fine nerves of a delicate organization; like the strings of an instrument capable of sweet m elodies, but easil y put out of tune or broken, b y rudeness, anger, and selfish indulgence. If life could, by any process, be made insensible to pain and pleasure; if the human heart were hard as adaman t, then avarice, ambition, and sen suality might channel out their paths in it, and make it their beaten way; and none w ould wonder or protest. If we could be patient under the load of a m ere worldly life; if we could bear that burden as the beasts bear it; then, like beasts, we m ight bend all our thoughts to the earth; and no call from the great Heavens above us would startle us from our plodding and earthl y course.

We are not willing to suffer, to be sick and afflict ed, to have our day s and months lost to comfort and joy , and overshadowed with calamity and grief, without advantage or compensat ion; to barter away the dearest treasures, the very sufferings, of the heart; to sell the life-blood from failing frame and fading cheek, our tears of bitterness and groans of anguish, for nothing. Human nature, frail, feeling, sensitive, and sorrowing, cannot bear to suffer for nought. Everywhere, human life is a great and solemn dispensation. Man, suffering, enjo ying, loving, hating, hoping, and fearing, chained to the earth and yet exploring the far recesses of the universe, has the power to com mune with God and His angels. Around this great action of existence the curtains of Time are drawn; but there are openings through the m which give us glimpses of eternit y. God looks do wn upon this scene of human probation. The wise and the good in all ages have interposed for it, with their teachings and their blood. Everything that exists around us, every movement in nature, every counsel of Providence, every interposition of God, centres upon one point – the fidelit y of man. And even if the ghosts of the departed and rem embered could come at midnigh t through the barred doors of our dwellings, and the shrouded dead should glide through the aisles of our churches and sit in our Ma sonic Temples, their teachings would be no more eloquent and impressive than the dread realities of life; than those memories of misspent years, those ghosts of departed opportunities, that, pointing to our con science and eternit y, cry continual ly in our ears, \" Work while the day lasts! for the night of death cometh, in which no man can work .\" There are no tokens of public mourning for the calamity of the soul.

It is all which m an perman ently is, his inward being, his divine energy, his imm ortal thought, his boundless capacit y, his infinite aspiration; and nevertheless, few value it for what it is worth. Few see a brother- mind in others, through the rags with which poverty has clothed it, beneath the crushing burdens of life, amidst the close pressure of worldly troubles, wants and sorro ws. Few acknowledge and cheer it in that humble blot, and feel that the nobilit y of earth, and the commencing glory of Heaven are there.

The y are proud of their mental powers; but the intrinsic, inner, infinite worth of their own minds they do not perceive. The poor man, admitted to a palace, feels, lofty and immortal being as he is, like a mere ordinar y thing amid the splendors that surround him. He sees the carriage of wealth roll by him, and forgets the intrinsic and eternal dignity of his own mind in a poor and degrading envy, and feels as an humbler creature, because others are above him, not in m ind, but in mensura tion. Men respect themselves, according as they are more wealth y, higher in rank or office, loftier in the world's opinion, able to com mand more votes, more the favorites of the people or of P ower. The difference among men is not so much in their nature and intrinsic power, as in the faculty of communication. Some have the capacit y of uttering and embodying in words their thoughts. All men, more or less, feel those thoughts. The glory of genius and the rapture of virtue, when rightl y revealed, are diffused and shared a mong unnumbered minds. When eloquence and poetry speak; when those glorious arts, statuary , painting, and music, take audible or visible shape; when patriotis m, charity, and virtue speak with a thrilling potenc y, the hearts of thousands glow with a kindred joy and ecstasy . If it were not so, there would be no eloquence ; for eloquence is that to which other hearts respond; it is the faculty and power of making other hearts respond. N o one is so low or degraded, as not sometimes to be touched with the beaut y of goodness.

That alone, of all things that have been mad e, compreh ends the Maker of all. That alone is the key which unlocks all the treasures of the Universe; the power that reigns over Space, Time, and Eternit y.

The five colu mns, in the five different orders of architecture, are emb lematical to us of the five principal divisions of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite: 1. The Tuscan , of the three blue Degrees, or the primitive Masonry. 2. The Doric , of the ineffable Degrees, from the fourth to the fourteenth, inclusive. 3.

To it, and the seven that continuall y revolve around it, mystical meanings are attached, which y ou will learn hereafter, if you should be permitted to advance, when you are made acquainted with the philosophical doctrines of the Hebrews.

They are also symbols of the first three Sephiroth , or Emana tions of the Deity, according to the Kabalah, Kether , the omn ipotent divine will ; Chochmah , the divine intellectual power to generate thought, and Binah , the divine intellec tual capacity to produce it – the two latter, usually translated Wisdom and Understanding , being the active and the passive , the positive and the negative , which we do not yet endeavor to explain to you. They are the columns Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the entrance to the Masonic Temple. In another aspect of this Degree, the Chief of the Architects [ רב בנים , Rab Banaim,] symbolizes the constitutional executive head and chief of a free g overnment ; and the Degree teaches us that no free government can long endure, when the people cease to select for their magistrates the best and the wisest of their statesmen; when, passing these by, they permit factions or sordid interests to select for the m the small, the low, the ignoble, and the obscure, and into such hands com mit the countr y's destinies.

XIII — ROY AL ARCH OF SOLOMON. WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historicall y true, or but an allegor y, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder m eaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendar y myth, you must find out for yo urself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrew s are not now permi tted to pronounce was in com mon use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred ti mes in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. We know that for man y centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and that under it, when the masoret ic points, which represent the vowels, cam e to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinar y and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amul et, a protection against personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessaril y disappearing as the intellec t of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason. It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctit y of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HO M was suppo sed by the ancient Persians (who were among the earliest emigran ts from Northern India) to be pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utteranc e the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word A UM or O M, the Sacred Name of the One Deit y, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the efficac y of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could being errors, have formed no part of the pure primi tive religion, or of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the conceal ment of some other Name or truth, the interpreta tion and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few . If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and s ymbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has alwa ys been that Page 150 of 621"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike allegori es, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood b y the sages, have beco me or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masore tic points were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the nam e of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and therefore that that is not the true nam e of Deit y, nor the Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretat ion. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word w as a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one interpretat ion – true, but not the inner and profoundest one . Men were figurative ly said to forget the name of God, when the y lost that knowledge , and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the Initiat es to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegor y, in which are represented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other de ities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidunim, and Malc m, the Aam nite god, and built high ū ū places for Kam s, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aam n. The true ū ū nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert they did that made for them by Aar n. ū The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one onl y God until a late period in their history. Their early and popular ideas of the Deit y were singularl y low and unworthy . Even while Moses wa s receiving the law upon M ount Sinai, the y forced Aaron to make them an image of the Eg yptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the wor ship of the gods of the Mitzraim ; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshippers of the false gods of all the surroun ding nations. \"Ye have borne,\" Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years' journeying in the desert, under Moses, \"the tabernacle of your Malec and Kai n your idols, the star of ū your god, which ye made to yourselves.\" Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of God formed by individuals varied according to their intel lectual and spiritual capaciti es; poor and i mperfec t, and investing God with the commonest and coarsest attributes of human ity, among the ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richl y gifted.

Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deit y for the enlighten ed, intellig ent, and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the m ass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around the m, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as the y believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshipped by their neighbors – \"Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?\" – expres sed their whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrew s talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the cool of the day; he conversed with Ka yin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise ; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determ ination in regard to Sodom; he wre stled with Jacob; he showed Mo ses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performanc e of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarit y. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellec t was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almight y. But such were not the ideas of the intellec tual and enlightened few among the Hebrew s. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations – Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric; they did not com municate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were com municated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Ph œnicia, in Greece and Samothrac e, in the greater mysteries, to the Initiates. The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry , or Free or Frank- Masonry . That knowledge was, in one sen se, the Lost W ord , which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as the y are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then known. Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history , with its present Degrees , further than the year 1700, if so far .

The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has com e down to us in Masonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majorit y of those w ho use the m. Those numbers were especiall y employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented his attribut es, or figured in the fram e-work of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame-work. These were universall y regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelligenc e, the utterances of Divinit y Himself. The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4+3+2=9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four , by which the ancients presented Nature , it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the ele ments, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deit y, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His attributes, is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of U niversal Nature, and may be read there b y all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellec t and intelligence. This knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word . Within the Temple, all the arrange ments were mystically and symbolically connected with the same system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported b y twelve columns, representing the twelve mon ths of the y ear. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one of the twelve celesti al signs was appropriated to Page 153 of 621"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike each column. The brazen sea was supported b y twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass. And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told, from the rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light; and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the ma thematical equalit y of the angles and sides, the beautiful and harmonious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Universe; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, the Trinity of Power, Wisdom, and Harmon y, which presided at the building of this marv ellous work, These three great lights also represent the great mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and reproduction or regeneration, consecrated by all creeds in their numerous Trinities. The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason , given b y God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity. The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure mot ives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow- men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who w ere buried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purpose s, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify their pride, their vanity, or their ambition. The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mou th the key wherewith to open it, figurative ly represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to the true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and phy sical Universe. ENOCH [ חונך Khan c], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching ō the age of sixty-five – \"walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him.\" His name signifi ed in the Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the colu mns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the mysteries, of which Masonr y is the legitimate successor – from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegori es. The legend of this Degree is thus, partial ly, interpret ed. It is of litt le importance whether it is in anywise historical. For its value consists in the lessons w hich it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those w ho receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history . Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the m yth.

They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [ ארי, אריה , Arai , Araiah , which also me ans the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx. But there is one application of this Degree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering that Kh r m, the Master, is the symbol of h ū ū uman freedom, you would probabl y discover for y ourself. It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Libert y is a fundamen tal law, charter, or constitution ; the expression of the fixed habits of thought of the people, embodied in a written instrum ent, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of centuries; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hastily changed, nor be violated with impun ity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, w hich none could touch and live. A perman ent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciar y, an electiv e legislature of two branches, an executiv e responsible to the people, and the right of trial by jury, will guarantee the liberties of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionar y theories of impossible perfection. Masonry teaches its Initiat es that the pursuits and occupations of this life, its activit y, care, and ingenuit y, the predestined develop ments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in mak ing the world; and are not at war with the great purpose of life. It teaches that ever ything is beautiful in its time, in its place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if rightl y and faithful ly done, naturall y helps to work out his salvation; that if he obe ys the genuine principles of his calling, he will be a good man : and that it is only by neglect and non-performan ce of the task set for hi m by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their beneficent and loft y spirit, that he beco mes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himself to it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his religious homag e and gratitude. For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery , a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to tasks. It has a mean ing and an intent. A living heart pours life- blood into the toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's labors. The y are the home affections. Labor toils a-field, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the means of support and co mfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine. Man y faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hast y words are uttered; but still the toils go on, wear y and hard and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy , or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than mere selfish impulses, the scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist.

Whether, during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in ter ms, to his conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or not; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and desire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good and religious life, and made a most essential contribut ion to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equit y between man and man, and of truth and right action in the world. Books, to be of religious tendenc y in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious exercises, or of pray ers. What-ever inculca tes pure, noble, and patrioti c sentim ents, or touches the heart with the beaut y of virtue, and the excellence of an up-right life, accords with the religion of Masonry, and is the Gospel of litera ture and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from many a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miser able narrownes s, not to recognize these wide- spread agencies of Heaven's providing; not to see and welco me these many-handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone. There is also a religion of societ y. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment; for there is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrit y of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious course, for any temptation; his integrit y and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity. In gay assemblies for amuse ment, the good affections of life gush and ming le. If they did not, these gathering- places would be as drear y and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends m eet, and hands are warml y pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not polic y, or self-interest, or selfishness that spreads such a char m around that meeting, but the halo of bright and beautiful affection. The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the world; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and marri age-altars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy workshops, and dusty highway s, and paved streets. There is not a worn stone upon the sidewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mu tual kindness; nor a wooden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with affection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels, that is surel y here and ever ywhere; honest, heartfel t, disinterested, inexpressible affection. Every Masonic Lodge is a temp le of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are inculcat ed disinterestedness, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism , truth, a generous s ympathy with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fallen, mercy for Page 156 of 621"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and .Charit y.

This is the true religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for m any centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as tim e endures. If unworth y passions, or selfish, bitter, or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and not welcom e, strangers uninvited, and not guests. Certainl y there are man y evils and bad pas sions, and much hate and conte mpt and unkindness ever ywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The hand of merc y leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simpli city live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also. Love clasps the hand of love, a mid all the envyings and distractions of showy compe tition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long night-watch by the bedside of the suffering neighbor, amidst the surrounding povert y and squalid misery. Devoted men go from city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilence that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women well-born and delica tely nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plague- stricken with a patient and generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungr y, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friendless dead. Ever ywhere God finds and blesses the kindly office, the pitying thought, and the loving heart. There is an ele ment of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affections. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religion of life, answering, with however man y a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beaut y and glor y in Humani ty, in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes, and swelling hills, and the wondrous glory of the starr y heavens. Men ma y be virtuous, self- improving, and religious in their employments. Precisely for that, those e mployments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love, the ties of family, were made to be hol y, They may be religious, not by a kind of protest and resistance against their several vocations; but by conform ity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious laborers, whether in field or factor y; religious physicians, lawyers, sculptors, poets, painters, and musicians. They may be religions in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad earth its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kindled by the brightness of Heaven. Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and ask s for freedo m. It looks forth from the narrow and grated window s of sense, upon the wide im measurable creation; it knows that around it and be yond it lie outstretched the infinite and everlasting paths. Page 157 of 621"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Everything within us and without us ought to stir our m inds to adm iration and wonder. We are a mystery encompassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with m atter is a mystery; the wonderful telegraphi c communication between the brain and every part of the body, the power and action of the will. Ever y familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchant ment. The power of movem ent is as m ysterious as the power of thought. Memor y, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes of dead memories are alike inexplic able. Universal harmon y springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We are connected by ties of thought, and even of ma tter and its forces, with the whole boundless U niverse and all the past and com ing generations of men. The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutin y as the econom y of the most distant star. Ever y leaf and ever y blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no human penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of life. No man can know what his power of secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery. Step where we will, we tread upon wonders. The sea- sands, the clods of the field, the water- worn pebbles on the hills, the rude masses of rock, are traced over and over, in every direction, with a hand- writing older and more significant and subli me than all the ancient ruins, and all the overthrown and buried cities that past generations have left upon the earth; for it is the handwriting of the Almight y. A Mason 's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of drudgeries, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and science, many-leaved, still spreads before us the same tale of wonder. We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and up-right, and no more, just as happy as our charact er prepares us to be, and no more. Our mora l, like our ment al character, is not formed in a mo ment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of man y thoughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ties. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is to be affected by every present feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improve ment, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour 's delay to enter the right path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus an swered for, if not according to the full measure of its ill- desert, yet according to a rule of unbending rectitud e and imp artiality. The law of retribution presses upon ever y man, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the courses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were not so, G od's government would not be i mpartial; there would be no discrimin ation; no moral dominion ; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence. Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good or evil, grave or ga y, that which we do to- day and shall do to-morrow; each thought, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, ever y breathing moment; all are contributing to form the character, according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, – our character, – will, in that Page 158 of 621"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike future scrutiny , be sifted out from the mass; and, particle by particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our j oys or woes. Thus ever y idle word and idle hour will give answer in the judgment. Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil temptation comes upon us; the opportunit y of unrighteous gain, or of unhallowed indulgence, either in the sphere of business or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and plant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. To-morrow it will threaten discovery . Agitated and alarmed, we cover the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In the bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that sin dies not, but thrives and grows; and other and still other germs of evil gather around the accursed root; until, from that single seed of corruption, there springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery , or vice. Loathingl y, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges u s onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignomin y, or remorse gathers its shadow s around our steps even on earth; and are yet but the beginnings of sorrow s. The evil deed ma y be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, me mory never sleeps; guilt never can becom e innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace. Beware, thou who art te mpted to evil! Beware what thou la yest up for the future! Beware what thou lay est up in the archives of eternit y! Wrong not th y neighbor! lest the thought of him thou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang w hich years will not deprive of its bitterness! Break not into the house of innocence, to rifle it of its treasure; lest when man y years have passed over thee, the moan of its distress ma y not have died away from thine ear! Build not the desolate throne of a mbition in thy heart; nor be busy with devices, and circumv entings, and selfish schemings; lest desolation and loneliness be on thy path, as it stretches into the long futurit y! Live not a useless, an impious, or an injurious life! for bound up with that life is the immutable principle of an endless retribution, and ele ments of God's creating, which will never spend their force, but continue ever to unfold with the ages of eternit y. Be not deceived! God has formed thy nature, thus to answer to the future.

MASON. [Perfect Elu.] IT is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Masonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a wise consideration and anal ysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does not inculcat e her truths. She states them, once and briefl y; or hints them, perhaps, darkl y; or interposes a cloud between the m and eyes that would be dazzled by them. \" Seek , and ye shall find ,\" knowledge and the truth. The practical object of Masonry is the ph ysical and mora l amelioration and the intel lectual and spiritual improve ment of individuals and societ y. Neither can be effected, except by the dissemina tion of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallac y in principles, to which most of the miser ies of men and the m isfortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right on any point; and there are and alway s will be import ant truths to be substituted in that opinion in the place of man y errors and absurd and injurious pre judices. There are few truths that public opinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies; and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radiant from the immediate presence of God. There are mora l maladies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires not onl y boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; since they are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral, politica l, and religious, than of vicious inclina tions. Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speech revealing it, to him who even partially compreh ends all the Degrees in proportion as he receives them; and particular ly to those who advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in the Degree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is a worship . Masonry labors to i mprove the social order b y enlightening men's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, inspiring them with the great principle of human fraternit y, and requiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall con-form to Page 160 of 621"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, control their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as one afflicted with a deplorable malady. It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as G od planted it in the heart of universal human ity. No creed has ever been long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is the base, and they are the superstructure. \"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and wido ws in their affliction, and to keep himse lf unspotted from the world.\" \"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?\" The ministers of this religion are all Masons w ho compr ehend it and are devoted to it; its sacrifices to God are good work s, the sacrifices of the base and disorderl y passions, the offering up of self-interest on the altar of humani ty, and perpetual efforts to attain to all the mora l perfection of which man is capable. To make honor and duty the steady beacon- lights that shall guide your life-vessel over the stormy seas of time; to do that which it is right to do, not because it will insure yo u success, or bring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be \"the best polic y,\" more prudent or mor e advisable; but because it is right, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantl y against error, intoleran ce, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those who err, to be tolerant even of intoleranc e, to teach the ignorant, and to labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason. A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its face with the same countenance with which he hears its story; that can endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting his body , that can equall y despise riches when he hath them and when he hath them not; that is, not sadder if they are in his neighbor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about his own walls; one that is not moved with good fortune com ing to him, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's lands with equanim ity and pleasure, as if the y were his own; and y et look upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were another man's; that neither spends his good s prodigall y and foolishl y, nor yet keeps the m avariciousl y and like a miser ; that weighs not benefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circu mstances of him who confers the m; that never thinks his charit y expensive, if a worthy person be the receiver ; that does nothing for opinion' s sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful of his thoughts as of his acting in marke ts and theatres, and in as much awe of himself as of a whole assembl y; that is, bountiful and cheerful to his friends, and charitabl e and apt to forgive his enem ies; that loves his country , consults its honor, and obe ys its laws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he may do his duty and honor God. And s uch a Mason ma y reckon his life to be the life of a man, and compu te his months, not by the course of the sun, but b y the zodiac and circle of his virtues. The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is a fami ly, and every individual a child. Masonr y, not in anywise derogating from the differing duties which the diversit y of states requires, tends to create a new people, which, co mposed of men of man y nations and tongues, s hall all be bound together by the bonds of science, morality, and virtue. Essentiall y philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it has for the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of God and his providence, and of the im mortality of the soul; Page 161 of 621"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike for its object, the dissemin ation of moral, political, philosophical, and religious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age, its device has been, \"Libert y, Equalit y, Fraternit y,\" with constitutiona l governmen t, law , order , discipline , and subordination to legitimate authorit y – government and not anarchy . But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. It e mbraces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vast fraternal association. It recognizes the dignit y of human nature, and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and it knows nothing that should place one man below another, except ignorance, debase ment, and crim e, and the necessit y of subordination to lawful will and authorit y. It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that all men are of the same origin, have common interests, and should co- operate together to the same end. Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give to each other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstances of life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as their joys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions, and be perfectl y tolerant of the errors, of each other, in matters of faith and beliefs. It is philosophical, because it teaches the great Truths concerning the nature and existence of one Supreme Deity, and the existence and im mortality of the soul. It revives the Academy of Plato, and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reitera tes the maxims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentia lly enforces the subli me lessons of Him who died upon the Cross. The ancients thought that universal human ity acted under the influence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: of which the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and Devotedness; and the Evil toward Falsehood, Servilit y, and Selfishness. Masonry represents the Good P rinciple and constantl y wars against the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, the Mithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadl y feud with the de mons of ignorance, brutalit y, baseness, falsehood, slavishnes s of soul, intoleran ce, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the insolence of wealth, and bigotr y. When despotism and superstition, twin-power s of evil and darknes s, reigned everywhere and seemed invincibl e and immortal, it invented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, the allegor y, the symbol, and the emblem, and transmi tted its doctrines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancient symbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displa ys in every civilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light its great principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts of kings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and interdict ion. Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much positive truth as file human mind is capable of receiving; whether that truth is attain ed by the exercise of reason, or communicated by revelation. It must necessaril y be both limited and allo yed, to bring it within the competen ce of finite human intelligence. Being finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite; being ma terial, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual. We do believe in and know the infinit y of Space and Time, and the spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity and spirituali ty eludes us. Even Omnipoten ce cannot Page 162 of 621"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike infuse infinite conceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirel y changing the conditions of our being, pour a comple te and full knowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrow capacit y of a 'human soul. Human intelligence could not grasp it, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessaril y, the measure of the invisible. The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. His kno wledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. His conceptions of other things and other beings are only his conceptions . They are not those things or beings themselves . The living principle of a living Universe must be INFI NITE; while all our ideas and conceptions are finite , and applicab le only to finite beings. The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge , but of faith ; not to be approached by the understanding , but by the moral sense ; not to be conceived , but to be felt . All atte mpts to embrace the Infinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only accommodations to the frailt y of man. Shrouded from human compreh ension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination is awed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weaknes s, the Divine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dogmati ze. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfull y aware of its own insufficienc y. And ye t it is here that man most dogmati zes, classifies and describes God' s attribut es, makes out his map of God's nature, and his inventor y of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions; and then hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogma tically as he, makes out a different map and inventory . The common understanding has no humil ity. Its God is an incarnate Divinit y. Imperf ection imposes its own limitations on the Illi mitable, and clothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms that come within the grasp of the senses and the intelle ct, and are derived from that infinite and imp erfect nature which is but God' s creation. We are all of us, though not all equall y, mistaken. The cherished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the pure truth of God; but simpl y our own s pecial form of error, our guesses at truth, the refracted and fragm entary rays of light that have fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have their day, and cease to be; the y are but broken lights of God; and He is mor e than they. Perfect truth is not attainab le anywhere. We style this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches is imperf ect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuit of truth, nor contentedl y acquiesce in error. It is our duty always to press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unattainable, yet the amoun t of error in our views is capable of progressive and perpetual diminu tion; and thus Masonry is a continual struggle toward the light. All errors are not equall y innocuous. That which is most injurious is to enterta in unworthy conceptions of the nature and attributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by ignorance of the True Word. The true word of a Ma son is, not the entire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highest and noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable of forming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannot communicate to another his own conception of Deit y; since every man's conception of God must be proportioned to his menta l cultivat ion, and intel lectual powers, and mora l excellen ce. God is, as man conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself. Page 163 of 621"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike For ever y man's conception of God must vary with his men tal cultivat ion and men tal powers. If any one contents himself with an y lower image than his intelle ct is capable of grasping, then he contents himself with that which is false to him , as well as false in fact . If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false. And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the conceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptions of God are those of the ignorant, narrow-mind ed, and vindictiv e Israelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, me aner, and more limited view of His nature, than the faculti es which He has bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we can form is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one, we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel that it is an affront and an indignit y to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short- sighted, capricious, and unju st; as a jealous, an angr y, a vindictive Being. When we examine our conceptions of His charact er, if we can conceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, and magn ificent character, then this latter is to us the true conception of Deity ; for nothing can be imagined more excell ent than He . Religion, to obtain currenc y and influence with the great mass of mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of error as to place it far below the standard attainabl e by the higher human capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cultivated human reason could discern, would not be compreh ended by, or effectiv e over, the less educated portion of mankind. What is Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have the effect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the man y must necessaril y be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflect ive few, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in the spiritual idea which lies latent at the botto m of it, as in the symbols and dogmas in which that idea is embodi ed. The truest religion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the ignorant, nor consolator y to them, nor guiding and supporting for them. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in the language of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to convey to a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doctrine. A perfectl y pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures, a system of noble theism and loft y morality, would find too litt le preparation for it in the com mon mind and heart, to admit of prompt reception by the masses of mank ind; and Truth m ight not have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error. The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as an Original Creator; as a God at hand, and not mere ly one afar off in the distance of infinite space, and in the remo teness of Past or Future Eternit y. He conceives of Him as taking a watchful and presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influencing the hearts and actions of men. To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Matter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and ment al frame, His direct work. He believes that God has mad e men with different intellectual capacities; and enabled some, by superior intel lectual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from the mass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankind should make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnant discover y, He calls into being some intellec t of more than ordinar y magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, and grander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humani ty.

He so arranges, that nature and the course of events shall send men into the world, endowed with that higher mental and mora l organization, in which grand truths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneousl y and inevitab ly arise. These speak to men by inspiration. Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag inary type, to us, of humani ty in its highest phase; an exemplar of what man may and should beco me, in the course of ages, in his progres s toward the realiza tion of his de stiny; an individual gifted with a glorious intellec t, a noble soul, a fine organization, and a perfectl y balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanit y may be, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time; the possibility of the race made real . The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but perplexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that every man sent upon this earth, and especiall y every man of superior capacit y, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism to be baptized with; that every great and good man possesses some portion of God 's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, and which must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simple sense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intell ectual to be inspired, and to be so for the instruction, advance ment, and elevat ion of mankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipr esence, is not lim ited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, or Moslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequence of a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God is its source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as the intell ectual endowmen ts, the mora l wealth of the soul, and the degree of cultivation of those endowments and faculti es differ. It is limited to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world and common as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancy of mank ind, to monopoliz e inspiration, and bar God out of the soul. We are not born in the dotage and deca y of the world. The stars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavens are fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wherever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason utter their oracles, there is God, as formerl y in the hearts of seers and prophets. No s oil on earth is so holy as the good m an's heart; nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to the learned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithful child of God. Certain as the open e ye drinks in the light, do the pure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a presence within the soul. The conscience is the ver y voice of Deit y. Masonry , around who se altars the Christian, the Hebrew, the Moslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster, can assembl e as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God who is above all the Baali m, must needs leave it to each of its Initiates to look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the written scriptures of his o wn religion. For itself it finds those truths definite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon the heart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views of religion and dut y, wrought out by the meditations of the studious, confir med by the allegian ce of the good and wise, stamped as sterling by the respon se they find in every uncorrupted mind, commend themse lves to Masons of every creed, and ma y well be accept ed by all. Page 165 of 621"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Mason does not pretend to dogmat ic certain ty, nor vainl y imagine such certain ty attainable. He con siders that if there were no written revelation, he could safel y rest the hopes that animate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions of reason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He can find a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductions of the intellec t and convictions of the heart. For reason proves to him the existence and attribut es of God; and those spiritual instincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuse into his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of the beneficenc e of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future existence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringl y point to virtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose of man's life. He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame- work and revolutions of the Earth, the mysterious beauties and adaptations of anima l existence, the moral and ma terial constitution of the hum an creature, so fearfull y and wonderfull y made; and is satisfied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the author of the starr y Heavens above him, and of the mora l world within him; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, its worship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, in the glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with unutterable thoughts. These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitating ly receive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improv ement; and fitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only a little lower than the angels. The worthlessness of cere monial observances, and the necessit y of active virtue; the enforce ment of purit y of heart as the security for purit y of life, and of the government of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners of action; universal philanthrop y, requiring us to love all men, and to do unto others that and that only which we should think it right, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness of in juries; the necessity of self- sacrifice in the discharge of duty ; humility; genuine sincerit y, and being that which we seem to be; all these sublime precepts need no mirac le, no voice from the clouds, to recom mend them to our allegiance, or to assure us of y their divine origin. The y command obedience by virtue of their inherent rectitud e and beaut y; and have been, and are, and will be the law in every age and ever y country of the world. God revealed them to man in the beginning. To the Mason, G od is our Father in Heaven, to be Whose especial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to see Whose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever at hand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fervent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whose most acceptab le worship is a pure and pitying heart and a beneficent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whose merc iful disposal we are resigned b y that death which, we hope and believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wise decrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an el ysium of mere indolent content. As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man, Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and litt le from which they can dissent. He is our Father ; and we are all brethren . This much lies open to the most ignorant and bus y, as fully as to those who have most leisure and are most learned. This needs no Priest to teach it, and no authorit y to indorse it; and if ever y man did that onl y which is consistent with it, it would exile Page 166 of 621"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike barbarit y, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treacher y, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad passions bey ond the confines of the world. The true Mason, sincerel y holding that a Supreme God created and governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws, which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwavering, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrow s are ordained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaborat ion and develop ment; because they are the necessar y results of the operation of laws, the best that could be devised for the happiness and purification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunit y for the practice of all the virtues, from the home liest and most common, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not even that, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious, eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believes that the ordained operations of nature, which have brought miser y to him, have, from the ver y unswerving tranquili ty of their career, showered blessings and sunshine upon man y another path; that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or mai med him in its allotted course, is pres sing onward to the acco mplishment of those serene and m ighty purposes, to have contributed to which, even as a victi m, is an honor and a recompense. He takes this view of Time and Nature and God, and ye t bears his lot without murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, the best possible, because ordained b y God. He does not believe that God loses sight of him , while superintending the march of the great harmon ies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen, when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long succession of its operations pre-ordained, that in the great march of those events, he would suffer pain and undergo cala mity. He believes that his individual good entered into God's consideration, a, well as the great cardinal results to which the course of all things is tending. Thus believing, he has attained an emin ence in virtue, the highest, amid passive excellence, which humanit y can reach. He finds his reward and his support in the reflect ion that he is an unreluctant and self-sacrificing co-operator with the Creator of the Universe; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capable of so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then trul y entitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason. He is content to fall early in the battle, if his bod y may but form a stepping-stone for the future conquests of humani ty. It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectl y good, can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to receive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else as such pain is a necessar y part in the schem e of the Universe, which as a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it with submission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What- ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares for His creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not have been so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or for s ome other persons, or for some things. To compl ain and lament is to mur mur against God's will, and worse than unbelief. The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mou ld than those of the ignorant and unreflect ing, and is instinct with a diviner life, – who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven rather than the peace of Eden, – to whom a loftier being brings severer cares, – who knows that man does not live by pleasure or content alone, but by the Page 167 of 621"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike presence of the power of God, – must cast behind him the hope of an y other repose or tranquill ity, than that which is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must relinquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble is the avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim his lamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligent ly done. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tradition, he must build his own hou se, his own system of faith and thought, for himse lf, The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be our stimula ting and sustaining power. Our ob ject, and not ourselves, should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when te mporary, and for time. Spun out to eternit y, it does not become celestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven or Bliss, but for Duty. In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts to those of thousands of others, to contribute to the carr ying forward of a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for a very distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future advent of some great amend ment; the amount which each one contributes to the achieve ment of ultimate success, the portion of the price which justice should assign to each as his especial production, can never be accurat ely ascertained. Perhaps few of those who have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, to bring about some political or social change, which the y felt convinced would ultim ately prove of vast service to humani ty, lived to see the change effected, or the anticipa ted good flow from it. Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciab le weight their several efforts contributed to the achieve ment of the change desired. Man y will doubt, whether, in truth, these exertions have any influence whatever; and, discouraged, cease all active effort. Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevate and purify his motives , as well as sedulousl y cherish the conviction, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thing as effort thrown awa y; that in all labor there is profit; that all sincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarily followed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appropriate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon the waters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground can fail to quicken in due ti me and measure; and that, however we may, in moments of despondenc y, be apt to doubt, not only whether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we s hall have contributed to its triumph, – there is One, Who has not only seen ever y exertion we have made, but Who can assign the exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain the great victory over social evil. No good w ork is done wholly in vain, The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Subli me Mason will in nowise deserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will, that self-su staining energy ; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthly hope, nor ever thinks of victory , but, content in its own consum mation, combats because it ought to comb at, rejoicing fights, and still rejoicing falls. The Augean Stables of the World, the accu mulated uncleanness and misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse them thoroughl y away; every drop we contribute aids to swell that river and augm ent its force, in a degree appreciable by God, though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, will not be over-anxious that his individual drops should be distinguishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizing waters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow in ineffective singleness away . Page 168 of 621"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The true Mason will not be careful that his nam e should be inscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God. It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purit y of purpose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success; that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infinitel y small concern; and still more, that the consciousness of having so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is his sufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect, Perfect, and Subli me Mason cherish this faith. It is a dut y. It is the brillian t and never-d ying light that shines within and through the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes the perfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divine name of God. He w ho industriousl y sows and reaps is a good laborer, and worth y of his hire. But he who sows that which shall be reaped by others, by those w ho will know not of and care not for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, w orthy of a more excellent reward. The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluing of this life, as an insignificant and unworthy portion of existence; for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, therefore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insincere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the compensa tion of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and so does in jury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress. Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed. It is the beginning of our immortality. Those onl y who feel a deep interest and affection for this world will work resolutel y for its amelioration; those w hose affections are transferred to Heaven, easil y acquiesce in the m iseries of earth, deeming them hopeless, befitting, and ordained; and console themselv es with the idea of the am ends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, that those most decidedl y given to spiritual contemplation, and to making religion rule in their hearts, are often most apatheti c toward all improv ement of this world's systems, and in many cases virtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to politica l and social reform, as diverting men's energies from eternity. The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macera te the body into weaknes s and disorder, and disparage what he sees to be beautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakabl y dear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature which God has given him, to struggle after one which He has not bestowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spiritual, but a composite being, m ade up of bod y and mind, the body having, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful, and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of this fact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admi t it in weaknesses and inevitab le failings. He believes that his spirituali ty will come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spiritual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, until then, God mean t it to be com manded and controlled, but not neglected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of, heav y consequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, after its present life, as to its continued and eternal being, and the character of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed. These are to hi m topics of the profoundest interest, and the most ennobling and refining contemplation. They occupy much of his leisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and cala mities of this life, as his hope s are disappointed and his visions of happiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in its race of hour s; when the is harassed and toil- worn, and the burden of his ye ars weighs heavy on him, the Page 169 of 621"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike balance of attraction graduall y inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to his loft y speculations with a tenacit y of interest which needs no in- junction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consoling privilege of the aspiring, the wa yworn, the wear y, and the bereaved. To him the contem plation of the Future lets in light upon the Present, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He endeavors rightl y to adjust the respective claims of Heaven and earth upon his tim e and thought, so as to give the proper proportions thereof to perform ing the duties and entering into the interests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultivation and purification of his own character, and to the public service of his fellow- men. The Mason does not dogmati ze, but entertaining and uttering his own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same; and only hopes that the time will cone, even if after the lapse of ages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, and one law alone, the law of love, shall govern God' s whole Universe. Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to y ou, without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, but hath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as we wear, with humility, and conscious of yo ur demerits and short-com ings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Subli me Mason. It was not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the number of the Apo stles of Christ, and seventy- two that of his Disciples: that John addres sed his rebukes and mena ces to the Seven churches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. At Bab ylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid of Seven stories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentri c inclosures, each of a different color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same number is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. The Sephiroth, or Emana tions, ten in number, three in one class, and seven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras. Seven Amschaspands or planetar y spirits were invoked with Ormuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with the head of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personages alone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale of the grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadæ, whose father Hellas, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; Seven Titans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; Seven Corybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of Sy dyk; Seven prim eval Celestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karfesters who escaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a new race, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven C yclopes, also, built the walls of Tiryus. Celsus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians represented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed and planetar y, and the passage of the Soul through their successive spheres. The y erected in their holy caves, in which the mystic rites of the Mithriac initiations were practised, what he denom inates a high ladder , on the Seven steps of which were Seven gates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principal heavenl y bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until they reached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled a transmigr ation through the spheres.

The word translated ladder , is סלם Salam, from סלל , Salal, raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piled up into a heap, Aggeravit . סללה Salalah , means a heap, rampar t, or other accumu lation of earth or stone, artific ially made; and סלע , Salaa or Salo , is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name of the city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew w ord to designate a pyramid. The symbolic mounta in Meru was a scended by Seven steps or stages; and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocks thrown up in fiat countries were imitations of this fabulous and mystic mountain, for purposes of w orship. These were the \"High Places\" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on w hich the idolaters sacrificed to foreign gods. The pyramids were sometimes square, and somet imes round. The sacred Bab y lonian tower [ מגדל , Magdol], dedicated to the great Father Bal, was an artific ial hill, of pyramidal shape, and Seven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color, representing the Seven planetar y spheres by the appropriate color of each pla net. Meru itself was said to be a single mounta in, terminating in three peaks, and thus a s ymbol of the Trimurti. The great Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a temp le as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancient pagoda at Deogur was s urmount ed by a tower, sustaining the mystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple of Bal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting on an eighth that served as basis, and successivel y diminishing in size from the botto m to the top; and Strabo tells us it was a pyramid. Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was reall y a pyramid with Seven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture, through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach the summit, and then descended through similar doors on the opposite side of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul being thus represented. Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples were intended to symbolize the Universe, which itself was habitual ly called the Temple and habitation of Deity . Every temple was the world in min iature; and so the whole world was one grand te mple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and therefore the Persians, Celts, and Sc ythians strongly disliked artificial covered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian temples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnificent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobius says that the entire Universe was j udiciousl y deemed by many the Temple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deit y to be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, variegated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuine Temple of the Divinit y. How comple tely the Temple of Solomon was sy mbolic, is manifest, not onl y from the continual reproduction in it of the sacred numbers and of astrologica l symbols in the historical descriptions of it; but also, and y et more, from the details of the im aginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekiel in his vision. The Apocal ypse comple tes the demonstr ation, and sho ws the kabalistic meanings of the whole.

All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the number of the constella tions, the signs of the zodiac, or the c ycles of the planets; and each one was a microcos m or symbol of the Universe, having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven. All temples were originall y open at the top, having for roof the sk y. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whatever the number of the pillars, they were m ystical everywhere.

Around the temples of Chilm inar in Persia, of Baalbec, and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartar y, on the frontier of China, stood forty pillars.

The leading lesson of this Degree is Fidelit y to obligation, and Constanc y and Perseverance under difficulti es and discourage ment. Masonry is engaged in her crusade, against ignorance, intolerance, fanaticism , superstition, uncharitab leness, and error. She does not sail with the trade- winds, upon a smooth sea, with a steady free breeze, fair for a welcoming harbor; but meets and must overco me many opposing currents, baffling winds, and dead cal ms. The chief obstacles to her success are the apathy and faithlessness of her own selfish children, and the supine indifference of the world. In the roar and crush and hurr y of life and business, and the tumult and uproar of politics, the quiet voice of Masonry is unheard and unheeded. The first lesson which one learns, who engages in any great work of reform or beneficenc e, is, that men are essentiall y careless, lukewar m, and indifferent as to everything that does not concern their own personal and immediate welfare. It is to single men, and not to the united efforts of man y, that all the great works of man, struggling toward perfection, are owing. The enthusiast, who imagin es that he can inspire with his own enthusiasm the mu ltitude that eddies around him, or even the few who have associated themselves with him as co-workers, is grievousl y mistaken ; and most often the conviction of his own mistak e is followed by discouragem ent and disgust.

He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimm er, who struggles against a rapid current, in a river lashed into angr y waves by the winds. O ften they roar over his head, often the y beat him back and baffle him. Most men yield to the stress of the current, and float with it to the shore, or are swept over the rapids; and onl y here and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on toward ultim ate success. It is the mot ionless and stationar y that most frets and imp edes the current of progre ss; the solid rock or stupid dead tree, rested firmly on the bottom; and around which the river whirls and eddies: the Mason s that doubt and hesitate and are discouraged; that disbelieve in the capabili ty of man to improv e; that are not disposed to toil and labor for the interest and well-being of general humani ty; that expect others to do all, even of that which they do not oppose or ridicule; while they sit, applauding and doing nothing, or perhaps prognosticating failure. There were man y such at the rebuilding of the Temple. There were prophets of evil and misfortun e – the lukewarm and the in- different and the apathetic ; those who stood b y and sneered; and those who thought they did God service enough if they now and then faintly applauded. There were ravens croaking ill omen, and mur murers who preached the folly and futility of the attempt. The world is mad e up of such; and they were as abundant then as they are now. But gloomy and discouraging as was the prospect, with lukewar mness within and bitter opposition without, our ancient brethren persevered. Let us leave them engaged in the good work, and whenever to us, as to them, success is uncertain, remote, and contingent, let us still remember that the onl y question for us to ask, as true men and Masons, is, w hat does duty require; and not what will be the result and our reward if we do our dut y. Work on, with the Sword in one hand, and the Trowel in the other! Masonry teaches that God is a Paternal Being, and has an interest in his creatures, such as is expressed in the title Father ; an interest unknown to all the systems of Paganis m, untaught in all the theories of philosophy ; an interest not onl y in the glorious beings of other spheres, the Sons of Light, the dwellers in Heavenl y worlds, but in us, poor, ignorant, and unworthy; that He has pity for the erring, pardon for the guilt y, love for the pure, knowledge for the humb le, and promises of imm ortal life for those who trust in and obe y Him. Without a belief in Him, life is miserable, the world is dark, the Universe disrobed of its splendors, the intellec tual tie to nature broken, the charm of existence dissolved, the great hope of being lost; and the mind, like a star struck from its sphere, wanders through the infinite desert of its conceptions, without attrac tion, tendenc y, destiny , or end. Masonry teaches, that, of all the events and actions, that take place in the universe of worlds and the eternal succession of ages, there is not one, even the minutest, which God Page 174 of 621"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike did not forever foresee, with all the distinctness of imm ediate vision, comb ining all, so that man's free will should be His instrum ent, like all the other forces of, nature. It teaches that the soul of man is formed by Him for a purpose; that, built up in its proportions, and fashioned in every part, by infinite skill, an emanation from His spirit, its nature, necessit y, and design are virtue. It is so formed, so moulded, so fashioned, so exactly balanced, so exquisitel y proportioned in ever y part, that sin introduced into it is misery; that vicious thoughts fall upon it like drops of poison; and guilt y desires, breathing on its delicate fibres, make plague- spots there, deadly as those of pestilence upon the bod y. It is made for virtue, and not for vice; for purit y, as its end, rest, and happiness. Not more vainly would we atte mpt to mak e the mountain sink to the level of the valley, the waves of the angry sea turn back from its shores and cease to thunder upon the beach, the stars to halt in their swift courses, than to change any one law of our o wn nature. And one of those laws, uttered by God's voice, and speaking through ever y nerve and fibre, every force and element, of the moral constitution He has given us, is that we must be upright and virtuous; that if tempted we must resist; that we must govern our unrul y passions, and hold in hand our sensual appetit es. And this is not the dictate of an arbitrar y will, nor of s ome stern and impracticable law; but it is part of the great firm law of harmon y that binds the Universe together: not the mere enactm ent of arbitrar y will; but the dictate of Infinite Wisdom. We know that God is good, and that what He does is right. This known, the works of creation, the changes of life, the destinies of eternit y, are all spread before us, as the dispensations and counsels of infinite love. This known, we then know that the love of God is working to issues, like itself, beyond all thought and im agination good and glorious; and that the only reason why we do not understand it, is that it is too glorious for us to understand. God's love takes care for all, and nothing is neglect ed. It watches over all, provides for all, m akes wise adaptations for all; for age, for infanc y, for matur ity, for childhood; in every scene of this or another world; for want, weakness, joy , sorrow, and even for sin. All is good and well and right; and shall be so forever. Through the eternal ages the light of God 's beneficence shall shine hereafter, disclosing all, consum mating all, rewarding all that deserve reward. Then we shall see, what now we can only believe. The cloud will be lifted up, the gate of m ystery be passed, and the full light shine forever; the light of which that of the Lodge is a symbol. Then that which caused us trial shall yield us triumph; and that which made our heart ache shall fill us with gladness; and we s hall then feel that there, as here, the only true happiness is to learn, to advance, and to improve ; which could not happen unless we had com menced with error, ignorance, and imperfection. We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light. Page 175 of 621"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike XVI — PRINCE OF JERUSALEM. XVI — PRINCE OF JERUSALEM. WE no longer expect to rebuild the Temple at Jerusale m. To us it has become but a symbol. To us the whole world is God' s Temple, as is every upright heart. To establish all over the world the New Law and Reign of Love, Peace, Charity, and Toleration, is to build that Temple, most acceptabl e to God, in erecting which Masonry is now engaged. No longer needing to repair to Jerusalem to worship, nor to offer up sacrifices and shed blood to propitiate the Deity, man may make the woods and mounta ins his Churches and Temples, and worship God with a devout gratitude, and with works of charit y and beneficenc e to his fellow- men. Wherever the humbl e and contrite heart silently offers up its adoration, under the overarching trees, in the open, level meadows, on the hill- side, in the glen, or in the city's swarming streets; there is God' s House and the New Jerusalem . The Princes of Jerusalem no longer sit as magistra tes to judge between the people; nor is their number limited to five. But their duties still remain substantial ly the same, and their insignia and symbols retain their old significance. Justice and Equit y are still their character istics. To reconcile disputes and heal dissensions, to restore am ity and peace, to soothe dislikes and soften prejudices, are their peculiar duties; and they know that the peacemakers are blessed. Their emblems have been alread y explained. They are part of the language of Masonry ; the same now as it was when Moses learned it from the Egyptian Hierophants. Still we observe the spirit of the Divine law, as thus enunciated to our ancient brethren, when the Temple was rebuilt, and the book of the law again opened: \"Execute true judgment; and sho w mercy and compassion every man to his brother. Oppress not the widow nor the fatherless, the stranger nor the poor; and let none of yo u imagine evil against his brother in his heart. Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the judgment of Truth and Peace in your gates; and love no false oath; for all these I hate, saith the Lord. \"Let those who have power rule in righteousness, and Princes in judgment. And let him that is a judge be as an hiding- place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place; as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Then the vile person shall no more be called liberal; nor the churl bountiful; and the work of j ustice shall be peace; and the effect of justice, quiet and securit y; and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of the ti mes. Walk ye righteousl y and speak uprightl y; despise the gains of oppression, shake from your hands the conta mination of bribes; stop not your ears against the cries of the oppressed, nor s hut your eyes that you may not see the crimes of the great; and you shall dwell on high, and y our place of defence be like munitions of rock s.\" Forget not these precepts of the old Law; and especiall y do not forget, as you advance, that every Mason, however humble, is your brother, and the laboring man your peer! Remember always that all Masonry is work, and that the trowel is an emblem of the Page 176 of 621"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Degrees in this Council. Labor, when rightl y understood, is both noble and ennobling, and intended to develop man's mor al and spiritual nature, and not to be deemed a disgrace or a misfortun e. Everything around u s is, in its bearings and influences, moral. The serene and bright morning, when we recover our con scious existence from the embraces of sleep; when, from that image of Death God calls us to a new life, and again gives us existence, and His mercies visit us in ever y bright ra y and glad thought, and call for gratitude and content; the silence of that early dawn, the hushed silence, as it were, of expecta tion; the hol y eventide, its cooling breeze, its lengthening shadows, its falling shades, its still and sober hour; the sultry noontide and the stern and solemn midnight; and Spring-ti me, and chastening Autumn; and Summ er, that unbars our gates, and carries us forth am idst the ever-renewed wonders of the world; and Winter, that gathers us around the evening hearth: – all these, as they pass, touch by turns the springs of the spiritual life in us, and are conducting that life to good or evil. The idle watch- hand often points to something within us; and the shadow of the gnomon on the dial often falls upon the conscience. A life of labor is not a state of inferiorit y or degradation. The Alm ighty has not cast man's lot beneath the quiet shades, and amid glad groves and lovel y hills, with no task to perform ; with nothing to do but to rise up and eat, and to lie clown and rest. He has ordained that Work shall be done, in all the dwellings of life, in ever y productive field, in every busy city, and on every wave of ever y ocean. And this He has done, because it has pleased Him to give man a nature destined to higher ends than indolent repose and irresponsible profitless indulgence; and because, for developing the energies of such a nature, work wa s the necessary and proper elem ent. We migh t as well ask why He could not make two and two be six, as why He could not develop these energies without the instrum entality of work. The y are equally impossibil ities. This, Masonry teaches, as a great Truth; a great moral land-mark, that ought to guide the course of all mankind. It teaches its toiling children that the scene of their daily life is all spiritual, that the very implements of their toil, the fabrics the y weave, the merchand ise they barter, are designed for spiritual ends; that so believing, their daily lot may be to them a sphere for the noblest improve ment. That which we do in our intervals of relaxat ion, our church- going, and our book-reading, are especiall y designed to prepare our minds for the action of Life. We are to hear and read and medi tate, that we may act well; and the action of Life is itself the great field for spiritual improve ment. There is no task of industry or business, in field or forest, on the wharf or the ship's deck, in the office or the exchange, but has spiritual ends. There is no care or cross of our dail y labor, but was especiall y ordained to nurture in us patience, calmness, resolution, perseverance, gentleness, disinterestedness, magnanimity. Nor is there any tool or impl ement of toil, but is a part of the great spiritual instrumen tality. All the relations of life, those of parent, child, brother, sister, friend, associate, lover and beloved, husband, wife, are moral, throughout ever y living tie and thrilling nerve that bind them together. They cannot subsist a day nor an hour without putting the mind to a trial of its truth, fidelit y, forbearance, and disinterestedn ess.

There is no blow struck in it but has a purpose, ulti mately good or bad, and therefore moral. There is no action perform ed, but has a mo tive; and mot ives are the special jurisdiction of moral ity. Equipages, houses, and furniture are symbols of what is moral, and the y in a thousand ways minister to right or wrong feeling. Everything that belongs to us, minister ing to our co mfort or luxur y, awakens in us emotions of pride or gratitude, of selfishness or vanit y; thoughts of self- indulgence, or mercifu l remembrances of the need y and the destitute. Everything acts upon and influences us. God 's great law of s ympathy and harmon y is potent and inflexib le as His law of gravitation. A sentence embod ying a noble thought stirs our blood; a noise m ade by a child frets and exasperates us, and influences our actions. A world of spiritual objects, influences, and relations lies around us all. We all vaguel y deem it to be so; but he only lives a charm ed life, like that of genius and poetic inspiration, who com munes with the spiritual scene around him, hears the voice of the spirit in ever y sound, sees its signs in ever y passing form of things, and feels its impu lse in all action, passion, and being. Very near to us lies the mines of wisdom; unsuspected they lie all around us. There is a secret In the simplest things, a wonder in the plainest, a charm in the dullest. We are all naturall y seekers of w onders. We travel far to see the majest y of old ruins, the venerable forms of the hoar y mountains, great water-falls, and galleries of art. And yet the world-wonder is all around us; the wonder of setting suns, and evening stars, of the magic spring-ti me, the blossoming of the trees, the strange transformat ions of the mo th; the wonder of the Infinite Divinit y and of His boundless revelation. There is no splendor beyond that which sets its morning throne in the golden East; no. dome sublim e as that of Heaven; no beaut y so fair as that of the verdant, blossoming earth; no place, however invested with the sanctities of old time, like that home which is hushed and folded within the embrac e of the humblest wall and roof. And all these are but the symbols of things far greater and higher. All is but the clothing of the spirit. In this vesture of ti me is wrapped the immortal nature: in this sho w of circumstance and form stands revealed the stupendous realit y. Let man but be, as he is, a living soul, com muning with himself and with God, and his vision becomes eternity; his abode, infinity; his hom e, the bosom of all-embracing love. The great problem of Humanity is wrought out in the humblest abodes; no more than this is done in the highest. A human heart throbs beneath the beggar's gabardine; and that and no more stirs with its beating the Prince's man tle. The beaut y of Love, the char m of friendship, the sacredness of Sorrow, the herois m of Patience, the noble Self-sacrifice, these and their like, alone, make life to be life indeed, and are its grandeur and its power. They are the priceless treasures and glor y of humanit y; and they are not things of condition. All places and all scenes are alike clothed with the grandeur and char m of virtues such as these. The million occasions will come to us all, in the ordinar y paths of our life, in our homes, and by our firesides, wherein we may act as nobly , as if, all our life long, we led armies, sat in senates, or visited beds of sickness and pain.

XVII — KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST. THIS is the first of the Philosophical Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; and the beginning of a course of instruction which will fully unveil to you the heart and inner mysteries of Masonry. Do not despair because y ou have often seemed on the point of attaining the inmost light, and have as often been disappointed. In all time, truth has been hidden under s ymbols, and often under a succession of allegories: where veil after veil had to be penetrated before the true Light was reached, and the essential truth stood revealed. The Human Light is but an imperfe ct reflection of a ray of the Infinite and Divine. We are about to approach those ancient Religions which once ruled the minds of men, and whose ruins encumber the plains of the great Past, as the broken colu mns of Palm yra and Tadmor lie bleaching on the sands of the desert. They rise before us, those old, strange, mysterious creeds and faiths, shrouded in the mists of antiquit y, and stalk dimly and undefined along the line which divides Time from Eternit y; and forms of strange, wild, startling beauty mingled in the vast throngs of figures with shapes monstrous, grotesque, and hideous. The religion taught by Moses, which, like the laws of Egy pt, enunciated the principle of exclusion, borrowed, at every period of its existence, from all the creeds with which it came in contact. While, by the studies of the learned and wise, it enriched itself with the most admirab le principles of the religions of Egypt and Asia, it was changed, in the wanderings of the People, by everything that was most impure or seductive in the pagan manners and superstitions. It was one thing in the times of Moses and Aaron, another in those of David and Solomon, and still another in those of Daniel and Philo. Page 180 of 621"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike At the time when John the Baptist made his appearance in the desert, near the shores of the Dead Sea, all the old philosophical and religious systems were approxi mating toward each other. A general lassitude inclined the minds of all toward the quietude of that amalgamation of doctrines for which the expeditions of Alexander and the more peaceful occurrences that followed, with the establishm ent in Asia and Africa of man y Grecian dynasties and a great number of Grecian colonies, had prepared the way. After the intermingling of different nations, which resulted from the wars of Alexander in three- quarters of the globe, the doctrines of Greece, of Egypt, of Persia, and of India, met and intermingled everywhere. All the barriers that had formerl y kept the nations apart, were thrown down; and while the People of the West readil y connected their faith with those of the East, those of the Orient hastened to learn the traditions of Rome and the legends of Athens. While the Philosophers of Greece, all (except the disciples of Epicurus) more or less Platonists, seized eagerly upon the beliefs and doctrines of the East, – the Jews and Egyptians, before then the most exclusive of all peoples, yielded to that eclecticism which prevailed among their masters, the Greeks and Romans. Under the same influences of tolerat ion, even those who embraced Christianit y, mingled together the old and the new, Christianit y and Philosophy , the Apostolic teachings and the traditions of Mythology. The man of intelle ct, devotee of one sy stem, rarely displaces it with another in all its purit y. The people take such a creed as is offered the m. Accordingl y, the distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric doctrine, immemorial in other creeds, easily gained a foothold among many of the Christians; and it was held by a vast number, even during the preaching of Paul, that the writings of the Apostles were incompl ete; that they contained only the germs of another doctrine, which must receive from the hands of philosoph y, not only the systematic arrange ment which was wanting, but all the develop ment which la y concealed therein. The writings of the Apo stles, they said, in addressing the mselves to mankind in general, enunciated only the articles of the vulgar faith; but transmi tted the mysteries of knowledge to superior minds, to the Elect, – mysteries handed down from generation to generation in esoteric traditions; and to this science of the mysteries they gave the nam e of Γν ῶ σις; [Gnosis]. The Gnostics derived their leading doctrines and ideas from Plato and Philo, the Zend- avesta and the Kabalah, and the Sacred books of India and Eg ypt; and thus introduced into the bosom of Christianit y the cosmologi cal and theosophical speculations, which had formed the larger portion of the ancient religions of the Orient, joined to those of the Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish doctrines, which the Neo-Platonists had equall y adopted in the Occident. Emanation from the Deity of all spiritual beings, progressive degeneration of these beings from emanation to emanation, redemption and return of all to the purity of the Creator; and, after the re-establish ment of the primitive harmony of all, a fortunate and truly divine condition of all, in the bosom of God; such were the fundamen tal teachings of Gno sticism. The genius of the Orient, with its contem plations, irradiations, and intuitions, dictated its doctrines. Its language corresponded to its origin. Full of i magery, it had all the magnificence, the inconsistencies, and the mobi lity of the figurative style. Page 181 of 621"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Behold, it said, the light, which emanates from an immense centre of Light, that spreads everywhere its benevolent rays; so do the spirits of Light emanat e from the Divine Light. Behold, all the springs which nourish, emb ellish, fertilize, and purif y the Earth: they emanate from one and the same ocean; so from the bosom of the Divinit y emanate so many streams, which form and fill the universe of intelligen ces. Behold numbers, which all emanate from one primitive number, all resembl e it, all are composed of its essence, and still vary infinitel y; and utterances, decomposable into so man y syllables and elements, all contained in the primitive Word, and still infinitel y various; so the world of Intelligenc es emanated from a Primary Intellig ence, and they all resemb le it, and yet display an infinite variety of existences. It revived and combined the old doctrines of the Orient and the Occident; and it found in many passages of the Gospels and the Pastoral letters, a warrant for doing so. Christ himself spoke in parables and allegori es, John borro wed the enigmatical language of the Platonists, and Paul often indulged in inco mprehensib le rhapsodies, the mean ing of which could have been clear to the Initiates alone. It is admit ted that the cradle of Gno sticism is probably to be looked for in Syria, and even in Palestine. Most of its expounders wrote in that corrupted form of the Greek used b y the Hellenisti c Jews, and in the Septuagint and the New Testa ment; and there was a striking analogy between their doctrines and those of the Judeo-Egyptian Philo, of Alexandria; itself the seat of three schools, at once philosophic and religious – the Greek, the Egyptian, and the Jewish. Pythagoras and Plato, the most mystical of the Grecian Philosophers (the latter heir to the doctrines of the former), and who had travell ed, the latter in Egypt, and the former in Phœnicia, India, and Persia, also taught the esoteric doctrine and the distinction between the initiated and the profane. The dominan t doctrines of Platonis m were found in Gnosticism. Emanation of Intelligenc es from the bosom of the Deit y; the going astra y in error and the sufferings of spirits, so long as they are remote from God, and impr isoned in matter; vain and long-continued efforts to arrive at the knowledge of the Truth, and re- enter into their primitive union with the Supreme Being; alliance of a pure and divine soul with an irrational soul, the seat of evil desires; angels or demons who dwell in and govern the planets, having but an imperf ect knowledge of the ideas that presided at the creation; regeneration of all beings b y their return to the κ ό σμος νοητ ό ς, [kosmos no tos], the world ē of Intelligences, and its Chief, the Supreme Being; sole possible mode of re-establish ing that primitive harmon y of the creation, of which the music of the spheres of Pythagoras was the i mage; these were the analogies of the two systems; and we discover in them some of the ideas that form a part of Masonr y; in which, in the present mu tilated condition of the symbolic Degrees, the y are disguised and overlaid with fiction and absurdity , or present themselves as casual hints that are passed by wholly unnoticed. The distinction between the esoteric and exoteric doctrines (a distinction purely Masonic), was alway s and from the ver y earliest times preserved among the Greeks. It remounted to the fabulous ti mes of Orpheus; and the mysteries of Theosophy were found in all their traditions and myths. And after the time of Alexander, they resorted for instruction, Page 182 of 621"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike dogmas, and mysteries, to all the schools, to those of Egy pt and Asia, as well as those of Ancient Thrace, Sicily, Etruria, and Attica. The Jewish-Greek School of Alexandria is known only by two of its Chiefs, Aristobulus and Philo, both Jews of Alexandria in Egypt. Belonging to Asia by its origin, to Egypt by its residence, to Greece by its language and studies, it strove to show that all truths embedded in the philosophies of other countries were trans- planted thither from Palestine. Aristobulus declared that all the facts and details of the Jewish Scriptures were so man y allegori es, concealing the most profound me anings, and that Plato had borrowed from them all his finest ideas. Philo, who lived a centur y after him, following the same theory, endeavored to show that the Hebrew writings, by their system of allegories, were the true source of all religious and philosophical doctrines. According to him, the literal meaning is for the vulgar alone. Whoever has medi tated on philosoph y, purified himself by virtue, and raised himself by contemp lation, to God and the intellectual world, and received their inspiration, pierces the gross envelope of the letter, discovers a wholly different order of things, and is initiat ed into mysteries, of which the elementary or litera l instruction offers but an imperf ect image. A historical fact, a figure, a word, a letter, a number, a rite, a custom, the parable or vision of a prophet, veils the most profound truths; and he who has the key of science will interpret all according to the light he posses ses. Again we see the symbolism of Masonry, and the search of the Candidate for light. \"Let men of narrow minds withdraw,\" he says, \"with closed ears. We transmit the divine mysteries to those who have received the sacred initia tion, to those who practise true piet y, and who are not enslaved by the emp ty trappings of word s or the preconceived opinions of the pagans.\" To Philo, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light, or the Archet ype of Light, Source whence the rays emanate that illuminate Souls. He was also the Soul of the Universe, and as such acted in all its parts. He Himself fills and li mits His whole Being. His Po wers and Virtues fill and penetrate all. These Powers [Δυνάμεις, dunam eis] are Spirits distinct from God, the \"Ideas\" of Plato personified. He is without beginning, and lives in the protot ype of Time [αιων, aion]. His imag e is THE WORD [Λογος], a form more brilliant than fire; that not being the pure light. This LOGOS dwells in God; for the Supreme Being makes to Himself within His Intelligence the types or ideas of every thing that is to beco me reality in this World. The Logos is the vehicle by which God acts on the Universe, and may be compared to the speech of man. The LOGOS being the World of Ideas [κοσμος νοητος], by means whereof God has created visible things, He is the most ancient God, in compar ison with the World, which is the youngest production. The LOGOS, Chief of Intelligen ce , of which He is the general representativ e, is named Archangel, type and repre sentativ e of all spirits, even those of mortals. He is also st yled the man-type and primi tive man, Adam Kadmon. God only is Wise. The wisdom of man is but the reflection and imag e of that of God. He is the Father, and His WISDO M the mot her of creation: for He united Himself with WISDO M [Σοφια, Sophia], and com municated to it the germ of creation, and it brought Page 183 of 621"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike forth the ma terial world. He created the ideal world onl y, and caused the material world to be made real after its type, by His LOGOS, which is His s peech, and at the same time the Idea of Ideas, the Intellectua l World. The Intelle ctual City was but the Thought of the Architect, who med itated the creation, according to that plan of the Material City. The Word is not onl y the Creator, but occupies the place of the Supreme Being. Through Him all the Power s and Attributes of God act. On the other side, as first representat ive of the Human Family, He is the Protector of men and their Shepherd. God gives to man the Soul or Intelligenc e, which exists before the body, and which he unites with the body. The reasoning Principle comes from God through the Word, and communes with God and with the Word; but there is also in man an irrationa l Principle, that of the inclinations and pas sions which produce disorder, e manating from inferior spirits who fill the air as m inisters of God. The body, taken from the Earth, and the irrationa l Principle that animates it concurrentl y with the rational Principle, are hated by God, while the rational soul which He has given it, is, as it were, captive in this prison, this coffin, that encompasses it. The present condition of man is not his prim itive condition, when he was the image of the Logos. He has fallen from his first estate. B ut he may raise himself again, by following the directions of WISDO M [Σοφια] and of the Angels which God has comm issioned to aid him in freeing himself from the bonds of the body, and combating Evil, the existence whereof God ha s permitted, to furnish him the means of exercising his liberty . The souls that are purified, not by the Law but b y light, rise to the Heavenl y regions, to enjoy there a perfect felicity. Those that persevere in evil go from body to body, the seats of passions and evil desires. The familiar lineam ents of these doctrines will be recognized by all who read the Epistles of St. Paul, who wrote after Philo, the latter living till the reign of Caligula, and being the contempor ary of Christ. And the Mason is fam iliar with these doctrines of Philo: that the Supreme Being is a centre of Light whose ray s or emana tions pervade the Universe; for that is the Light for which all Masonic journey s are a search, and of which the sun and moon in our Lodges are onl y emblems: that Light and Darknes s, chief enemies from the beginning of Time, dispute with each other the emp ire of the world; which we symbolize by the candidate wandering in darkness and being brought to light: that the world was created, not by the Supreme Being, but by a secondary agent, who is but His WOR D [the Λογος], and by types which are but his ideas, aided by an INTELLIGENCE, or WISD OM [Σοφια], which gives one of Hi s Attributes; in which we see the occult meaning of the necessity of recovering \"the Word\"; and of our two columns of STRE NGTH and WISDO M, which are also the two parallel lines that bound the circle representing the Universe: that the visible world is the image of the invisible world; that the essence of the Human Soul is the image of God, and it existed before the bod y; that the object of its terrestrial life is to disengage itself of its body or its sepulchre; and that it will ascend to the Heavenl y regions whenever it shall be purified; in which we see the me aning, now almost forgotten in our Lodges, of the mode of preparation of the candidate for apprenticeship, and his tests and purifications in the first Degree, according to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Philo incorporated in his eclec ticism neither Egyptian nor Oriental elements. But there were other Jewish Teachers in Alexandria who did both. The Jews of Egypt were slightl y Page 184 of 621"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike jealous of, and a little hostile to, those of Palestine, particular ly after the erection of the sanctuar y at Leontopolis by the High-Priest Onias; and therefore they admired and magnified those sages, who, like Jerem iah, had resided in Egypt. \"The wisdom of Solomon\" was written at Alexandria, and, in the time of St. Jerome, was attribu ted to Philo; but it contains principles at variance with his. It personifies Wisdom, and draws between its children and the Profane, the same line of demarca tion that Egypt had long before taught to the Jews. That distinction existed at the beginning of the Mosaic creed. Moshah himself was an Initiate in the mysteries of Egypt, as he was compel led to be, as the adopted son of the daughter of Pharaoh, Thouoris , daughter of Seso stris-Ramses ; who, as her to mb and monu ments show, wa s, in the right of her infant husband, Regent of Lower Egypt or the Delta at the time of the Hebrew Prophet's birth, reigning at Heliopolis. She was also, as the reliefs on her tomb show, a Priestess of H ATHOR and NEITH, the two great primeval goddes ses. As her adopted son, living in her Palace and presence forty years, and during that time scarcel y acquainted with his brethren the Jews, the law of Egypt compe lled his initiation : and we find in man y of his enactm ents the intention of preserving, between the com mon people and the Initiates, the line of separation which he found in Egypt. Moshah and Aharun his brother, the whole series of High-P riests, the Council of the 70 Elders, Salo moh and the entire succession of Prophets, were in possession of a higher science; and of that science Masonry is, at least, the lineal descendant. It was familiarly known as THE KN OWLEDGE OF THE WORD. AMUN, at first the God of Lower Eg ypt only, where Moshah was reared [a word that in Hebrew means Truth], was the Suprem e God. He wa s styled \" the Celestial Lord, who sheds Light on hidden things .\" He was the source of that divine life, of which the crux ansata is the symbol; and the source of all power, He united all the attributes that the Ancient Oriental Theosoph y assigned to the Supreme Being. He was the πλ ή ρωμα (Plerom a), or \"Fullness of things,\" for He comprehended in Himself everything; and the LIGHT; for he wa s the Sun-God. He was unchangeable in the m idst of ever ything phenom enal in his worlds. He created nothing; but ever ything emanated from Him; and of Him all the other Gods were but manifesta tions. The Ram was His living symbol; which you s ee reproduced in this Degree, lying on the book with seven seals on the tracing- board. He caused the creation of the world by the Primitive Thought [Εννοια, Ennoia], or Spirit [Πνευμα, Pneuma], that issued from him by means of his Voice or the WORD; and which Thought or Spirit was personified as the Goddess NEITH. S he, too, wa s a divinity of Light , and mother of the Sun; and the Feast of Lamps was celebra ted in her honor at Sais. The Creative Power , another manifestation of Deity, proceeding to the creation conceived of in her, the Divine Intellig ence , produced with its Word the Universe, symbolized by an egg issuing from the mouth of KNEP H; from which egg cam e PHTHA, image of the Supreme Intelligence as realized in the world, and the type of that manifest ed in man ; the principal agent, also, of Nature, or the creative and productive Fire.

In this Degree, unknown for a hundred y ears to those who have practised it, these emb lems reproduced refer to these old doctrines. The lamb, the yellow hangings strewed with stars, the seven columns, candlesticks, and seals all recall them to us. The Lion was the symbol of ATH OM-RE, the Great God of Upper Eg ypt; the Hawk, of RA or P HRE; the Eagle, of MENDES; the Bull, of APIS; and three of these are seen under the platform on which our altar stands. The first HERMES was the INTELLIGENCE or WORD of G od. Moved with compassion for a race living without law, and wishing to teach them that they sprang from His bosom, and to point out to the m the way that they should go [the books which the first Hermes, the same with Enoch, had written on the m ysteries of divine science, in the sacred characters, being unknown to those who lived after the flood], God sent to man OSIRIS and Isis, accompanied by THOTH, the incarnat ion or terrestrial repetition of the first HERMES; who taught men the arts, science, and the cere monies of religion ; and then ascended to Heaven or the Moon. O SIRIS was the Principle of Good. TYPH ON, like AHRIMA N, was the principle and source of all that is evil in the mor al and physical order. Like the Satan of Gnosticism, he was confounded with Matter. From Egypt or Persia the new Platonists borrowed the idea, and the Gnostics received it from them, that man, in his terrestria l career, is successivel y under the influence of the Moon, of Mercury , of Venus, of the Sun, of Mars, of J upiter, and of Saturn, until he finall y reaches the Elysian Fields; an idea again symbolized in the Seven Seals. The Jews of S yria and Judea were the direct precursors of G nosticism ; and in their doctrines were amp le oriental elements. These Jews had had with the Orient, at two different periods, intimate relations, familiarizing them with the doctrines of Asia, and especiall y of Chaldea and Persia; – their forced residence in Central Asia under the Assyrians and Per sians; and their voluntar y dispersion over the whole East, when sub jects of the Seleucidæ and the Romans. Living near two-thirds of a centur y, and man y of them long afterward, in Mesopotamia, the cradle of their race; speaking the same language, and their children reared with those of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes, and Persians, and receiving from them their names (as the case of Dana yal, who wa s called Bæltasatsar, proves), the y necessaril y adopted many of the doctrines of their conquerors. Their descendants, as Azra and Naham aiah show us, hardly desired to leave Persia, when the y were allowed to do so. They had a special jurisdiction, and governors and judges taken from their own people; many of them held high office, and their children were educated with those of the highest nobles. Dana yal was the friend and min ister of the King, and the Chief of the College of the Magi at Babylon; if we ma y believe the book w hich bears his name, and trust to the incidents related in its highl y figurative and im aginative style. Mordecai, too, occupied a high station, no less than that of Prim e Minister, and Esther or Astar, his cousin, was the Monarch's wife. The Magi of Bab ylon were expounders of figurative writings, interpreters of nature, and of dreams, – astronomers and divines; and from their influences arose among the Jews, after Page 186 of 621"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike their rescue from captivit y, a number of sects, and a new exposition, the mystical interpret ation, with all its wild fancies and infinite caprices. The Aions of the Gnostics, the Ideas of Plato, the Angels of the Jews, and the Demons of the Greeks, all correspond to the Ferouers of Zoroaster. A great number of Jewish fami lies remained permanen tly in their new country ; and one of the most celebrat ed of their schools was at Bab ylon. They were soon fam iliarized with the doctrine of Zoroaster, which itself was more ancient than Kuros. From the system of the Zend-Avesta they borrowed, and subsequentl y gave large developm ent to, everything that could be reconciled with their own faith; and these additions to the old doctrine were soon spread, b y the constant intercourse of com merce, into Syria and Palestine. In the Zend-Avesta, God is Illi mitable Time. No origin can be assigned to Him: He is s o entirely enveloped in His glory , His nature and attributes are so inaccessible to human Intelligence, that He can be only the object of a silent Veneration. Creation took place by emanation from Him. The first emanation was the primitive Light, and from that the King of Light , ORMUZD. By the \"WORD,\" Ormuzd created the world pure. He is its preserver and judge; a Being Holy and Heavenly; Intelligence and Knowledge; the First-born of Time without li mits; and invested with all the Powers of the Supreme Being. Still he is, strictl y speaking, the Fourth Being. He had a Ferouer , a pre-existing Soul [in the language of Plato, a type or ideal ]; and it is said of Him, that He existed from the beginning, in the prim itive Light . But, that Light being but an elem ent, and His Ferouer a type, he is, in ordinar y language, the First-born of ZEROU ANE-AK HERENE. Behold, again, \"THE WORD\" of Masonry ; the Man , on the Tracing- Board of this Degree; the LIGHT toward which all Masons travel. He created after his own imag e, six Genii called Amshaspand s , who surround his Throne, are his organs of comm unication with inferior spirits and men, transmit to Him their prayers, solicit for them His favors, and serve them as models of purit y and perfection. Thus we have the Demiourgos of Gnosticis m, and the six Genii that assist him. These are the Hebrew A rchangels of the Planets. The names of these Amshaspands are Bahm an, Ardibehest, Schariver, Sapando mad, Khordad, and Amerdad. The fourth, the Holy SAPANDOMAD, created the first man and woman. Then ORMUZD created 28 Izeds , of whom MITHRAS is the chief. They watch, with Ormuzd and the Amshaspands , over the happiness, purity , and preservation of the world, which is under their government ; and the y are also models for mank ind and interpreters of men's prayers. With Mithras and Ormuzd , they make a pleroma [or comple te number] of 30, corresponding to the thirty Aions of the Gnostics, and to the ogdoade , dodecade , and decade of the Egyptians. Mithras was the Sun-God, invoked with, and soon confounded with him, becoming the object of a special worship, and eclipsing Ormuzd himself. The third order of pure spirits is more numerous. They are the Ferouers , the THOU GHTS of Ormuzd, or the IDEAS w hich he conceived before proceeding to the creation of things. They too are superior to men. They protect them during their life on earth; they will purify Page 187 of 621"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike them from evil at their resurrection. They are their tutelary genii, from the fall to the complete regeneration. AHRIMAN, second-born of the Prim itive Light, emanated from it, pure like ORMUZD; but, proud and ambi tious, yielded to jealousy of the First-born. For his hatred and pride, the Eternal condemned him to dwell, for 12,000 y ears, in that part of space where no ray of light reaches; the black empire of darkness. In that period the struggle between Light and Darknes s , Good and Evil , will be terminated. AHRIMAN scorned to submit, and took the field against ORMUZD. To the good spirits created by his Brother, he opposed an innumerab le army of Evil Ones. To the seven Amshaspand s he opposed seven Archdevs , attached to the seven Planets; to the Izeds and Ferouers an equal number of Devs , which brought upon the world all moral and ph ysical evils. Hence Poverty , Maladies , Impurity , Envy , Chagrin , Drunkenness , Falsehood , Calumny , and their horrible array. The image of Ahriman was the Dragon, confounded b y the Jews with Satan and the Serpent- Tempter. After a reign of 3000 y ears, Ormuzd had created the Material World, in six periods, calling successivel y into existence the Light, Water, Earth, plants, animals, and Man. But Ahriman concurred in creating the earth and water; for darkness was alread y an element, and Ormuzd could not exclude its Master. So also the two concurred in producing Man. Ormuzd produced, by his Will and Word, a Being that was the type and source of universal life for ever ything that exists under Heaven. He placed in man a pure principle, or Life, proceeding from the Supreme Being. But Ahriman destroyed that pure principle, in the form wherewith it was clothed; and when Ormuzd had made, of its recovered and purified essence, the first m an and woman, Ahriman seduced and temp ted them with wine and fruits; the woman yielding first. Often, during the three latter periods of 3000 y ears each, Ahriman and Darknes s are, and are to be, triu mphant. But the pure souls are assisted b y the Good S pirits; the Triumph of Good is decreed by the Supreme Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibl y arrive. When the world shall be most afflicted with the evils poured out upon it by the spirits of perdition, three Prophets will com e to bring relief to mortals. SOSIOSCH, the principal of the Three, will regenerate the earth, and restore to it its primi tive beauty, strength, and purit y. He will judge the good and the wicked. After the universal resurrection of the good, he will conduct them to a home of everlasting happiness. Ahriman, his evil demons, and all wicked men, will also be purified in a torrent of melted metal. The law of Ormuzd will reign ever ywhere; all men will be happy; all, enjoying unalterab le bliss, will sing with Sosiosch the praises of the Supreme Being. These doctrines, the details of which were sparingly borrowed b y the Pharisaic Jews, were much more fully adopted by the Gnostics; who taught the restoration of all things, their return to their original pure condition, the happiness of those to be saved, and their admission to the feast of Heavenl y Wisdom. The doctrines of Zoroaster came originall y from Bactria, an Indian Province of Persia. Naturall y, therefore, it would include Hindu or Buddhist elements, as it did. The fundam ental idea of Buddhism was, mat ter subjugating the intelligen ce, and intelligen ce Page 188 of 621"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike freeing itself from that slavery. Perhaps s omething came to Gno sticism from China. \"Before the chaos which preceded the birth of Heaven and Earth,\" says Lao-Tseu, \"a single Being existed, immense and silent, immovable and ever active – the mother of the Universe. I know not its name : but I designate it by the word Reason. Man ha s his type and model in the Earth; Earth in Heaven; Heaven in Reason; and Reason in Itself.\" Here again are the Ferouers, the Ideas, the Aions the REASON or INTELLIGENCE [Εννοια], SILENCE [Σιγ ή ], WORD [Λογος], and WISD OM [Σοφια] of the Gnostics. The dominan t system among the Jews after their captivit y was that of the Pharoschi m or Pharisees. Whether their na me was derived from that of the Parsees, or followers of Zoroaster, or from some other source, it is certain that the y had borrowed much of their doctrine from the Persians. Like them they claimed to have the exclusive and mysterious knowledge, unknown to the mass. Like them they taught that a constant war was waged between the Empire of Good and that of Evil. Like them they attributed the sin and fall of man to the demons and their chief; and like them they admitted a special protection of the righteous by inferior beings, agents of Jehovah. All their doctrines on these sub jects were at bottom those of the Holy Books; but singularl y developed; and the Orient was evidentl y the source from which those developm ents came. They styled themselves Interpreters ; a nam e indicat ing their claim to the exclusive possession of the true meaning of the Hol y Writings, by virtue of the oral tradit ion which Moses had received on Mount Sinai, and which successive generations of Initiates had transmitted, as they claimed, unaltered, unto the m. Their very costum e, their belief in the influences of the stars, and in the immortality and transmigr ation of souls, their system of angels and their astronom y, were all foreign. Sadduceeis m arose merely from an opposition essentiall y Jewish, to these foreign teachings, and that mixture of doctrines, adopted b y the Pharisees, and which constituted the popular creed. We come at last to the Essenes and Therapeuts , with whom this Degree is particul arly concerned. That intermingling of oriental and occidenta l rites, of Persian and Pythagorean opinions, which we have pointed out in the doctrines of Philo, is unmistakab le in the creeds of these two sects. They were less distinguished by metaphysical speculations than by simple meditations and moral practices. But the latter always partook of the Zoroastrian principle, that it was necessar y to free the soul from the trammels and influences of matter; which led to a system of abstinence and mac eration entirely opposed to the ancient Hebraic ideas, favorable as they were to ph ysical pleasures. In general, the life and manners of these m ystical associations, as Philo and Josephus describe them, and particular ly their prayers at sunrise, seem the image of what the Zend- Avesta prescribes to the faithful adorer or Ormuzd; and some of their observances cannot otherwise be explained. The Therapeuts resided in Egypt, in the neighborhood of Alexandria; and the Essenes in Palestine, in the vicinit y of the Dead Sea. But there was nevertheless a striking coincidence Page 189 of 621"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike in their ideas, readil y explained by attributing it to a foreign influence. The Jews of Egy pt, under the influence of the School of Alexandria, endeavored in general to mak e their doctrines harmon ize with the tradit ions of Greece; and thence came, in the doctrines of the Therapeuts, as stated by Philo, the man y analogies between the Pythagorean and Orphic ideas, on one side, and those of J udaism on the other: while the Jews of Palestine, having less com munication with Greece, or contemn ing its teachings, rather i mbibed the Oriental doctrines, which the y drank in at the source and with which their relations with Persia made them familiar. This attach ment was particular ly shown in the Kabalah, which belonged rather to Palestine than to Egypt, though extensivel y known in the latter ; and furnished the Gno stics with some of their most striking theories. It is a significant fact, that while Christ spoke often of the Pharisees and Sadducees, He never once men tioned the Essenes, between whose doctrines and His there was so great a resemblance, and, in m any points, so perfect an identit y. Indeed, the y are not named, nor even distinctl y alluded to, any where in the New Testam ent. John, the son of a Priest who ministered in the Temple at Jerusalem, and who se mother was of the fa mily of Aharun, was in the deserts until the day of his sho wing unto Israel. He drank neither wine nor strong drink. Clad in hair- cloth, and with a girdle of leather, and feeding upon such food as the desert afforded, he preached, in the country about Jordan, the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins; that is, the necessit y of repentance proven by reformat ion. He taught the people charity and liberalit y; the publicans, justice, equity, and fair dealing; the soldier y, peace, truth, and contentm ent; to do violence to none, accuse none falsel y, and be content with their pay. He inculcat ed the necessity of a virtuous life, and the foll y of trusting to their descent from Abraham. He denounced both Pharisees and Sadducees as a generation of vipers, threatened with the anger of God. He baptized those who confessed their sins. He preached in the desert; and therefore in the countr y where the Essenes lived, professing the same doctrines. He was imprisoned before Christ began to preach. Matthew men tions him without preface or explanat ion; as if, apparentl y, his histor y was too well known to need an y. \"In those day s,\" he says, \"came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.\" His disciples frequentl y fasted; for we find them with the Pharisees coming to Jesus to inquire why His Disciples did not fast as often as the y; and He did not denounce them , as His habit was to denounce the Pharisees; but answered them kindly and gentl y. From his prison, John sent two of his disciples to inquire of Christ: \"Art thou he that is to come, or do we look for another?\" Christ referred them to his mirac les as an answer; and declared to the people that John was a prophet, and more than a prophet, and that no greater man had ever been born; but that the humb lest Christian was his s uperior. He declared him to be Elias, who was to com e. John had denounced to Herod his marr iage with his brother's wife as unlawful; and for this he was impr isoned, and finall y executed to gratif y her. His disciples buried hi m; and Herod and others thought he had risen from the dead and appeared again in the person of Christ. The people all regarded John as a prophet; and Christ silenced the Priests and Elders b y asking them whether he was inspired. The y feared to excite the anger of the people by Page 190 of 621"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike saying that he was not. Christ declared that he came \"in the wa y of righteousness\"; and that the lower classes believed him, though the Priests and Pharisees did not. Thus John, who wa s often consulted by Herod, and to whom that monarch showed great deference, and wa s often governed b y his advice; whose doctrine prevailed very extensivel y among the people and the publicans, taught some creed older than Christianit y. That is plain: and it is equall y plain, that the very large body of the Jews that adopted his doctrines, were neither Pharisees nor Sadducees, but the humble, common people. They must, therefore, have been Essenes. It is plain, too, that Christ applied for baptism as a sacred rite, well known and long practic ed. It was becom ing to him, he said, to fulfill all righteousness. In the 18th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we read thus: \"And a certain Jew, named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and migh ty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord , and, being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught diligent ly the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John ; and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue; whom, when Aquilla and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto the m, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectl y.\" Translating this from the symbolic and figurative language into the true ordinary sense of the Greek text, it reads thus: \"And a certain Jew, named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and of extensive learning, came to Ephesus. He had learned in the mysteries the true doctrine in regard to God; and, being a zealous enthusiast, he spoke and taught diligent ly the truths in regard to the Deity, having received no other baptism than that of John.\" He knew nothing in regard to Christianit y; for he had resided in Alexandria, and had just then come to Ephesus; being, probably , a disciple of Philo, and a Therapeut. \"That, in all times,\" says St. Augu stine, \"is the Christian religion, which to know and follow is the most sure and certain health, called according to that name, but not according to the thing itself, of which it is the nam e; for the thing itself, which is now called the Christian religion, really was known to the Ancients , nor was wanting at any time from the beginning of the human race, until the time when Christ ca me in the flesh; from whence the true religion, which had previousl y existed, began to be called Christian; and this in our days is the Christian religion, not as having been wanting in former times, but as having, in later times, received this name.\" The disciples were first called \"Christians,\" at Antioch, when Barnabas and Paul began to preach there. The Wandering or Itinerant Jews or Exorcists, who assumed to employ the Sacred Name in exorcising evil spirits, were no doubt Therapeutæ or Essenes, \"And it came to pass,\" we read in the 19th chapter of the Acts, verses 1 to 4, \"that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper parts of Asia Minor, ca me to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples , he said to them, 'Have ye received the Holy Ghost since y e became Believers?' And they said unto him, 'We have not so much as heard that there is any Holy Ghost.' A nd he said to the m, 'In what, then, were yo u baptized?' And they said 'In J ohn's baptism.' Then said Paul, 'John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in Him who was to come after Page 191 of 621"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike him, that is, in Jesu s Christ. When the y heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" This faith, taught b y John, and so nearl y Christianit y, could have been nothing but the doctrine of the Essenes; and there can be no doubt that John belonged to that sect. The place where he preached, his macer ations and frugal diet, the doctrines he taught, all prove it conclusivel y. There was no other sect to which he could have belonged; certainl y none so numerous as his, except the Essenes. We find, from the two letters written by Paul to the brethren at Corinth, that City of Luxur y and Corruption, that there were contentions among them. Rival sects had alread y, about the 57th year of our era, reared their banners there, as followers, some of Paul, some of Apollos, and some of Cephas. Some of them denied the resurrection. Paul urged the m to adhere to the doctrines taught by himself, and had sent Ti mothy to them to bring them afresh to their recollect ion. According to Paul, Christ was to come again. He was to put an end to all other Principali ties and Powers, and finall y to Death, and then be Himse lf once more merged in God; who should then be all in all . The forms and cere monies of the Essenes were s ymbolical. They had, according to Philo the Jew, four Degrees; the members being divided into two Orders, the Practici and Therapeutici ; the latter being the contem plative and medic al Brethren; and the former the active, practical, business men. They were Jews by birth; and had a greater affection for each other than the members of any other sect. Their brotherl y love was intense. They fulfilled the Christian law, \"Love one another.\" They despised riches. No one was to be found among them, having more than another. The possessions of one were inter mingled with those of the others; so that they all had but one patrim ony, and were brethren. Their piety toward God was extraordinar y. Before sunrise they never spake a word about profane matters; but put up certain prayers which the y had received from their forefathers. At dawn of day, and before it was light, their pra yers and hy mns ascended to Heaven. The y were eminently faithful and true, and the Ministers of Peace. They had mysterious ceremonies, and initiations into their mysteries; and the Candidate promised that he would ever practise fidelity to all men, and especiall y to those in authorit y, \"because no one obtains the governm ent without God's assistance.\" Whatever they said, was firmer than an oath; but the y avoided swearing, and esteem ed it worse than perjur y. They were simple in their diet and mode of living, bore torture with fortitude, and despised death. They cultiva ted the science of medi cine and were ver y skillful. They deemed it a good omen to dress in white robes. The y had their own courts, and passed righteous judgmen ts. They kept the Sabbath more rigorously than the Jews. Their chief towns were Engaddi, near the Dead Sea, and Hebron. Engaddi was about 30 miles southeast from Jerusalem, and Hebron about 20 miles south of that city. Josephus and Eusebius s peak of them as an ancient sect; and they were no doubt the first among the Jews to embrac e Christianit y: with whose faith and doctrine their own tenets had so man y points of resemblanc e, and were indeed in a great measure the same. Pliny regarded them as a ver y ancient people. Page 192 of 621"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike In their devotions they turned toward the rising sun; as the Jews generall y did toward the Temple. But the y were no idolaters; for the y observed the law of Mo ses with scrupulous fidelity. They held all things in common, and despised riches, their wants being supplied by the administration of Curators or Stewards. The Tetract ys, composed of round dots instead of jods, was revered a mong them. This being a Pythagorean symbol, evidentl y shows their connection with the school of Pythagoras; but their peculiar tenets more resemble those of Confucius and Zoroaster; and probably were adopted while they were prisoners in Persia; which explains their turning toward the Sun in prayer. Their demeanor was sober and chaste. They submitted to the superintendenc e of governors whom they appointed over the mselves. The whole of their time was spent in labor, meditation, and prayer; and they were most sedulously attentiv e to every call of justice and humanity, and every moral duty. They believed in the unit y of God. They supposed the souls of men to have fallen, by a disastrous fate, from the regions of purity and light, into the bodies which the y occupy ; during their continuance in which the y considered them confined as in a prison. Therefore they did not believe in the resurrection of the body; but in that of the soul onl y. They believed in a future state of rewards and punishments; and they disregarded the cere monies or external forms enjoined in the law of Moses to be observed in the worship of God; holding that the words of that lawgiver were to be understood in a mysterious and recondite sense, and not according to their literal meaning. They offered no sacrifices, except at home; and by meditation they endeavored, as far as possible, to isolate the soul from the body, and carry it back to God. Eusebius broadly admits \"that the ancient Therapeutæ were Christians; and that their ancient writings were our Gospels and Epistles.\" The ESSENES were of the Eclectic Sect of Philosophers, and held PLATO in the highest esteem; they believed that true philosoph y, the greatest and most salutar y gift of God to mortals, was scattered, in various portions, through all the different Sects; and that it was, consequentl y, the duty of ever y wise man to gather it from the several quarters where it lay dispersed, and to emplo y it, thus reunited, in destro ying the domin ion of impiety and vice. The great festivals of the Solstices were observed in a distinguished manner by the Essenes; as would naturall y be suppo sed, from the fact that they reverenced the Sun, not as a god, but as a s ymbol of light and fire; the fountain of which, the Orientals supposed God to be. They lived in continence and abstinence, and had establish ments similar to the monasteries of the early Christians. The writings of the Essenes were full of m ysticism, parables, enig mas, and allegories. They believed in the esoteric and exoteric meanings of the Scriptures; and, as we have already said, they had a warrant for That in the Scriptures themselv es. They found it in the Old Testa ment, as the Gnostics found it in the New. The Christian writers, and even Christ himself, recognized it as a truth, that all Scripture had an inner and an outer meaning. Thus we find it said as follows, in one of the Gospels: \"Unto y ou it is given to know the m ystery of the Kingdom of God; but unto men that are without , all these things are done in parables; that seeing, they may see and not perceive, and hearing the y may hear and not understand... And the disciples came and said unto him, Page 193 of 621"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike 'Why speakest Thou the truth in parables?' – He answered and said unto them, 'Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.'\" Paul, in the 4th chapter of his Epistle to the Galatians, speaking of the simpl est facts of the Old Testa ment, asserts that they are an allegory . In the 3d chapter of the second letter to the Corinthians, he declares himself a minister of the New Testam ent, appointed by God; \"Not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter killeth.\" Origen and St. Gregory held that the Gospels were not to be taken in their literal sense; and Athanasius admonishes us that \"Should we understand sacred writ according to the letter, we should fall into the most enormous blasphemies.\" Eusebius said, \"Those who preside over the Holy Scriptures, philosophize over them, and expound their litera l sense b y allegor y.\" The sources of our kno wledge of the Kabalistic doctrines, are the books of Jezirah and Sohar, the former drawn up in the second centur y, and the latter a little later; but containing materials much older than themselv es. In their most character istic elements, they go back to the time of the exile. In them, as in the teachings of Zoroaster, everything that exists emanated from a source of infinite LIGHT. Before everything, existed THE AN CIENT OF DAYS, the KING OF LIGHT; a title often given to the Creator in the Zend-Avesta and the code of the Sabæans . With the idea so expressed is connected the pantheism of India. THE KING OR LIGHT, THE ANCIENT, is ALL THAT IS. He is not onl y the real cause of all Existences; he is Infinite [AINSOPH]. He is HIM SELF: there is nothing in Him that We can call Thou . In the Indian doctrine, not only is the Supreme Being the real cause of all, but he is the only real Existence : all the rest is illusion. In the Kabalah, as in the Persian and Gnostic doctrines, He is the Supreme Being unknown to all, the \"Unknown Father.\" The world is his revelat ion, and subsists only in Him. His attribut es are reproduced there, with different modifications, and in different degrees, so that the Universe is His Holy Splendor: it is but His Mantle; but it must be revered in silence. All beings have emanated from the Supreme Being: The nearer a being is to Him, the more perfect it is; the more remote in the scale, the less its purit y. A ray of Light, shot from the Deit y, is the cause and principle of all that exists. It is at once Father and Mother of All, in the sublimest sense. It penetrates everything; and without it nothing can exist an instant. From this double FORCE, designated by the two parts of the word I ∴ H ∴ U ∴ H ∴ emanated the FIRST-BORN of G od, the Universal FORM, in which are contained all beings; the Persian and Platonic Archet ype of things, united with the Infinite by the prim itive ray of Light. This First-Born is the Creative Agent, Conservator, and animating Principle of the Universe. It is THE LIGHT of LIGHT. It posses ses the three Primitive Forces of the Divinity, LIGHT, SPIRIT, and LIFE [Φώς, Πνευμά, and Ζων]. As it has received what it gives, Light and Life, it is equall y considered as the generative and conceptive Principle, the Primitive Man, ADAM KA DMON. As such, it has revealed itself in ten eman ations or Sephiroth , which are not ten different beings, nor even beings at all; but sources of life, Page 194 of 621"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike vessels of Omnipot ence, and types of Creation. They are Sovereignty or Will , Wisdom , Intellig ence , Benignity , Severity , Beauty , Victory , Glory , Permanency , and Empire . These are attributes of God; and this idea, that God reveals Himself by His attribut es, and that the human mind cannot perceive or discern God Himself, in his works, but onl y his mode of manifesting Himself, is a profound Truth. We know of the Invisible only what the Visible reveals. Wisdom was called NOUS and LO GOS [and Νο ῦ ς Λογος], I NTELL ECT or the WORD. Intellig ence , source of the oil of anointing, responds to the Holy Ghost of the Christian Faith. Beauty is represented by green and yellow. Victory is YAHOVAH-TSABAOTH, the column on the right hand, the colu mn Jachin : Glory is the colu mn Boaz , on the left hand. And thus our sy mbols appear again in the Kabalah. And again the LIGHT, the object of our labors, appears as the creativ e power of Deit y. The circle, also, wa s the special symbol of the first Sephirah, Kether, or the Crown, We do not further follow the Kabalah in its four Worlds of Spirits, Aziluth , Briah , Yezirah , and Asiah , or of emanation , creation , formation , and fabrication , one inferior to and one emerging from the other, the superior always enveloping the inferior; its doctrine that, in all that exists, there is nothing purely material; that all comes from God, and in all He proceeds by irradiation; that everything subsists by the Divine ra y that penetrates creation; and all is united by the Spirit of God, which is the life of life; so that all is God; the Existences that inhabit the four worlds, inferior to each other in proportion to their distance from the Great King of Light: the contest between the good and evil Angels and Principles, to endure until the Eternal Himself cones to end it and re- establish the prim itive harmon y; the four distinct parts of the Soul of Man; and the migr ations of impure souls, until they are sufficientl y purified to share with the Spirits of Light the conte mplation of the Supreme Being whose Splendor fills the Universe. The WORD was also found in the Phœnician Creed. As in all those of Asia, a WORD of God, written in starr y charact ers, by the planetar y Divinities, and com municated by the Demi-Gods, as a profound m ystery, to the higher classes of the human race, to be communicated by them to mankind, created the world. The faith of the Phœnicians was an emanation from that ancient worship of the Stars, which in the creed of Zoroaster alone, is connected with a faith in one God. Light and Fire are the most important agents in the Phœnician faith. There is a race of children of the Light. They adored the Heaven with its Lights, deeming it the Supreme God. Everything emanat es from a Single Principle, and a Primit ive Love, which is the Moving Power of All and govern s all. Light, by its union with Spirit, whereof it is but the vehicle or symbol, is the Life of ever ything, and penetrates everything. It should therefore be respected and honored every where; for every where it governs and controls. The Chaldaic and Jerusalem Paraphrasts endeavored to render the phrase, DEBAR- YAHOVAH [ דבר יהוה ], the Word of God, a personalit y, wherever they met with it. The phrase, \"And God created man,\" is, in the Jerusalem Targum, \"And the Word of I HUH created man.\" Page 195 of 621"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike So, in xxviii.

So in several places he calls it \"δε ύ τερος Θε ἰ ος Λ ό γος\" the Second Divinit y; \"ε ἰ κ ὼ ν του Θεο ῦ ,\" the Image of God: the Divine Word that made all things: \"the ὕ παρχος\" substitute, of God; and the like. Thus, when John comm enced to preach, had been for ages agitated, by the Priests and Philosophers of the East and West, the great questions concerning the eternity or creation of matter: immediate or interm ediate creation of the Universe b y the Supreme God; the origin, object, and final extinct ion of evil; the relations between the intel lectual and material worlds, and between God and man; and the creation, fall, redemp tion, and restoration to his first estate, of man. The Jewish doctrine, differing in this from all the other Oriental creeds, and even from the Aloha ȳ istic legend with which the book of Genesis comm ences, attributed the creation to the immediate action of the Supreme Being. The Theosophists of the other Eastern Peoples interposed more than one intermediary between God and the world. To place between them but a single Being, to suppose for the production of the world but a single inter mediary, was, in their eyes, to lower the Suprem e Majesty. The interval between God, who is perfect Purity, and mat ter, which is base and foul, was too great for the m to clear it at a single step. Even in the Occident, neither Plato nor Philo could thus impoverish the Intellec tual World. Thus, Cerinthus of Ephesus, with most of the Gnostics, Philo, the Kabalah, the Zend- Avesta, the Puranas, and all the Orient, deemed the distance and antipath y between the Supreme Being and the ma terial world too great, to attribute to the former the creation of the latter. Below, and emana ting from, or created by, the Ancient of Day s, the Central Light, the Beginning, or First Principle [Αρχ ὴ ], one, two, or more Principles, Existences, or Intelle ctual Beings were i magined, to some one or more of whom [without any immediate creative act on the part of the Great Im movable, Silent Deity], the immediate creation of the ma terial and mental universe was due. We have alread y spoken of man y of the speculations on this point. To some, the world was created by the LOGO S or WORD, first man ifestation of, or em anation from, the Deity. To others, the beginning of creation was by the emanation of a ray of LIGHT, creating the principle of Light and Life .

No restraints were laid on the Fancy and the Imagination. The veriest Abstractions became Existences and Realities. The attributes of God, personified, became Powers, Spirits, Intelligenc es. God was the Light of Light , Divine Fire , the Abstract Intellectua lity , the Root or Germ of the Universe. Simon Magus , founder of the Gnostic faith, and man y of the earl y Judaizing Christians, admitted that the man ifestations of the Supreme Being, as FATHER, or JEHOVAH, S ON or C HRIST, and HOLY SPIRIT, were onl y so man y different modes of Existence, or Forces [δυναμεις] of the same God. To others they were, as were the multitude of Su bordinate Intelligen ces, real and distinct beings. The Oriental imagination revelled in the creation of these Inferior Intelligen ces, Powers of Good and Evil, and Angels. We have spoken of those imagin ed by the Persians and the Kabalists. In the Tal mud, every star, ever y country , every town, and al most every tongue has a Prince of Heaven as its Protector. JEHUEL is the guardian of fire, and MIC HAEL, of water. Seven spirits assist each; those of fire being Seraphiel , Gabriel , Nitriel , Tammael , Tchimschiel , Hadarniel , and Sarniel . These seven are represented by the square columns of this Degree, while the colu mns JACHIN and BOAZ represent the angels of fire and water. But the colu mns are not representatives of these alone. To Basilides, God was without nam e, uncreated, at first containing and concealing in Himself the Plenitude of His Perfections; and when these are by Him displayed and manifested, there result as man y particular Existences, all analogous to Him, and still and always Him. To the Essenes and the Gnostics, the East and the West both devised this faith; that the Ideas, Conceptions, or Manifestations of the Deity were so man y Creations, so many Beings, all God, nothing without Him, but more than what we now understand by the word ideas . They emanated from and were again merged in God. The y had a kind of middle existence between our modern ideas, and the intelligenc es or ideas, elevat ed to the rank of genii, of the Oriental mythology. These personified attributes of Deit y, in the theory of Basi lides, were the Πρωτ ό γονος or First- born , Νο ῦ ς [ Nous or Mind ]: from it emanates Λογος [ Logos , or THE WORD] from it Φρ ό νησις: [ Phronesis , Intellect ]: from it Σοφια [ Sophia , Wisdom ]: from it Δ ύ ναμις [ Dunamis , Power ]: and from it Δικαιοσ ύ νη [ Dikaiosune , Righteousness ]: to which latter the Jews gave the nam e of Ειρηνη [ Eirene , Peace , or Calm ], the essential characterist ics of Divinity, and harmonious effect of all His perfections. The whole number of successive emanations was 365, expressed b y the Gnostics, in Greek letters, by the mystic word ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ [ Abraxas ]; designating God as man ifested, or the aggregate of his manifestations; but not the Supreme and Secret God Himself. These three hundred and sixty-five Intellig ences compose altogether the Fullness or Plenitud e [Πληρωμα] of the Divine Emanations. With the Ophites, a sect of the Gnostics, there were seven inferior spirits [inferior to Ialdabaoth, the Demiourgos or Actual Creator]: Michaël , Surièl , Raphaël , Gabriel , Page 197 of 621"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Thauthabaoth , Erataoth , and Athaniel , the genii of the stars called the Bull, the Dog, the Lion, the Bear, the Serpent, the Eagle, and the Ass that formerl y figured in the constella tion Cancer, and symbolized respective ly by those ani mals; as Ialdabaoth , Iao , Adonaï , Eloï , Oraï , and Astaphaï were the genii of Saturn, the Moon, the Sun, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercur y. The WORD appears in all these creeds. It is the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous of Platonis m and Philonism, and the Sophia or Demiourgos of the Gnostics. And all these creeds, while admitting these different manifestations of the Supreme Being, held that His identi ty was imm utable and perman ent. That was Plato's distinction between the Being alwa ys the same [τ ὸ ὄ ν] and the perpetual flow of things in cessantl y changing, the Genesis. The belief in dualis m in some shape, was universal. Those who held that everything emanated from God, aspired to God, and re-entered into God, believed that, among those emanations were two adverse Principles, of Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. This prevailed in Central Asia and in Syria; while in Egypt it assumed the form of Greek speculation. In the former, a second Intelle ctual Principle was admi tted, active in its Empire of Darkness, audacious against the Emp ire of Light. So the Persians and Sabeans understood it. In Eg ypt, this second Principle was Matter, as the word was u sed by the Platonic School, with its sad attribu tes, Vacuit y, Darknes s, and Death. In their theory, matter could be animated only by the low com munication of a principle of divine life. It resists the influences that would spiritualize it. That resisting Power is Satan, the rebellious Matter, Matter that does not partake of God. To many there were two Principles; the Unkno wn Father, or Supreme and Eternal God, living in the centre of the Light, happy in the perfect purity of His being; the other, eternal Matter, that inert, shapeless, darksome mass, which they considered as the source of all evils, the mo ther and dwelling- place of Satan. To Philo and the Platonists, there was a Soul of the world, creating visible things, and active in them, as agent of the Supreme Intelligenc e; realizing therein the ideas communicated to Him by that Intellig ence, and which someti mes excel His conceptions, but which He executes without co mprehending them. The Apocaly pse or Revelat ions, by whomever written, belongs to the Orient and to extreme antiquit y. It reproduces what is far older than itself. It paints, with the strongest colors that the Oriental genius ever employed, the closing scenes of the great struggle of Light, and Truth, and Good, against Darknes s, Error, and Evil; personified in that between the New Religion on one side, and Paganis m and Judaism on the other. It is a particul ar application of the ancient myth of Ormuzd and his Genii against Ahriman and his Dev s; and it celebrat es the final triumph of Truth against the comb ined powers of men and demons. The ideas and imag ery are borrowed from every quarter; and allusions are found in it to the doctrines of all ages. We are continuall y remind ed of the Zend-Avesta, the Jewish Codes, Philo, and the Gnosis.

The Christ of the Apocalypse, First-born of Creation and of the Resurrection, is invested with the character istics of the Ormuzd and Sosios ch of the Zend-Avesta, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah and the Carpistes [Καρπι ό της] of the Gnostics. The idea that the true Initiates and Faithful become Kings and Priests, is at once Persian, Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic. And the definition of the Supreme B eing, that He is at once Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end – He that was, and is, and is to come, i.e. , Time illimitable, is Zoroaster's definition of Zerouane- Akherene. The depths of Satan which no man can measure ; his triu mph for a ti me by fraud and violence ; his being chained by an angel; his reprobation and his precipitation into a sea of metal; his names of the Serpent and the Dragon; the whole conflict of the Good Spirits or celestia l armies against the bad; are so many ideas and designations found alike in the Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, and the Gnosis. We even find in the Apocalypse that singular Persian idea, which regards some of the lower animals as so many Devs or vehicles of Devs. The guardianship of the earth by a good angel, the renewing of the earth and heavens, and the final triumph of pure and hol y men, are the same victory of Good over Evil, for which the whole Orient looked. The gold, and white raiments of the twenty -four Elders are, as in the Persian faith, the signs of a loft y perfection and divine purit y. Thus the Human mind labored and struggled and tortured itself for ages, to explain to itself what it felt, without confessing it, to be inexplicab le. A vast crowd of indistinct abstractions, hovering in the imagination, a train of words embod ying no tangible meaning, an inextricable labyrinth of subtleties, was the result. But one grand idea ever emerged and stood prominen t and unchangeable over the weltering chaos of confusion. God is great, and good, and wise. Evil and pain and sorro w are temporar y, and for wise and beneficen t purposes. They must be consistent with God 's goodness, purit y, and infinite perfection ; and there must be a mode of explaining them, if we could but find it out; as, in all ways we will endeavor to do. Ulti mately, Good will prevail, and Evil be overthrown. God alone can do this, and He will do it, b y an Emana tion from Himself, assuming the Human form and redeem ing the world. Behold the object, the end, the result, of the great speculations and logo machies of antiquit y; the ultimate annihilat ion of evil, and restoration of Man to his first estate, by a Redeemer, a Masayah, a Christos, the incarnate Word, Reason, or Po wer of Deity. This Redeemer is the Word or Logos, the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous of Platonism and Philonism ; He that was in the Beginning with God, Page 199 of 621"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and was God, and b y Whom everything was made. That He was looked for b y all the People of the East is abundantl y shown by the Go spel of John and the Letters of Paul; wherein scarcel y anything seemed necessar y to be said in proof that such a Redee mer was to come; but all the energies of the writers are devoted to showing that Jesus wa s that Christos whom all the nations were expecting; the \"Word,\" the Masayah, the Anointed or Consecrated One. In this Degree the great contest between good and evil, in anticipation of the appearance and advent of the Word or Redee mer is symbolized; and the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes and the Cabalists. Of the practices of the former we gain but glimpses in the ancient writers; but we kno w that, as their doctrines were taught by John the Baptist, they greatly resemb led those of greater purity and more nearly perfect, taught by Jesus; and that not only Palestine was full of John' s disciples, so that the Priests and Pharisees did not dare to deny John's inspiration; but his doctrine had extended to Asia Minor, and had made converts in luxurious Ephesus, as it also had in Alexandria in Egypt; and that they readily embraced the Christian faith, of which the y had before not even heard. These old controversies have died away, and the old faiths have faded into oblivion. But Masonry still survives, vigorous and strong, as when philosophy was taught in the schools of Alexandria and under the Portico; teaching the same old truths as the Essenes taught by the shores of the Dead Sea, and as John the Baptist preached in the Desert;. truths imperishabl e as the Deity, and undeniable as Light. Those truths were gathered by the Essenes from the doctrines of the Orient and the Occident, from the Zend-Avesta and the Vedas, from Plato and Pythagoras, from India, Persia, Phœnicia, and Syria, from Greece and Egypt, and from the Hol y Books of the Jews. Hence we are called Knights of the East and West, because their doctrines ca me from both. And these doctrines, the wheat sifted from the chaff, the Truth separated from Error, Masonry has garnered up in her heart of hearts, and through the fires of persecution, and the storms of cala mity, has brought the m and delivered them unto us. That God is One, i mmutable, unchangeable, infinite ly just and good; that Light will finall y overco me Darkness, – Good conquer Evil, and Truth be victor over Error; – these, rejecting all the wild and useless speculations of the Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, the Gnostics, and the Schools, are the religion and Philosophy of Masonry .

All antiquit y solved the enigma of the existence of Evil, by supposing the existence of a Principle of Evil, of Demons, fallen Angels, an Ahriman, a Typhon, a Siva, a Lok, or a Satan, that, first falling themselves, and plunged in misery and darkness, te mpted man to his fall, and brought sin into the world. All believed in a future life, to be attain ed by purificat ion and trials; in a state or successive states of reward and punishmen t; and in a Mediator or Redee mer, by whom the Evil Principle was to be overco me, and the Supreme Deity reconciled to His creatures. The belief was general, that He was to be born of a Virgin, and suffer a painful death. The Indians called him Chrishna; the Chinese, Kioun- tse; the Persians, Sosiosch; the Chaldeans, Dhouvanai; the Egyptians, Har-Oeri; Plato, Love; and the Scandinavians, Balder. Chrishna, the Hindoo Redee mer, was cradled and educated among Shepherds. A Ty rant, at the time of his birth, ordered all the male children to be slain. He perform ed miracles, say his legends, even raising the dead. He washed the feet of the Brahmins, and was meek and lowly of spirit. He was born of a Virgin; descended to Hell, rose again, ascended to Heaven, charged his disciples to teach his doctrines, and gave the m the gift of m iracles. The first Masonic Legislator whose memory is preserved to us by history , was Buddha, who, about a thousand y ears before the Christian era, reformed the religion of Manous. He called to the Priesthood all men, without distinction of caste, who felt themse lves inspired by God to instruct men. Those who s o associated themselves formed a Societ y of Prophets under the name of Samane ans. They recognized the existence of a single uncreated God, in whose bosom everything grows, is developed and transformed. The wor ship of this God reposed upon the obedience of all the beings He created. His feasts were those of the Solstices. The doctrines of Buddha pervaded India, China, and Japan. The Priests of Brahma, professing a dark and bloody creed, brutalized by Superstition, united together against Buddhism, and with the aid of Despotism, exterminated its followers. But their blood fertilized the new doctrine, which produced a new Societ y under the name of Gymnosoph ists; and a large number, fleeing to Ireland, planted their doctrines there, and there erected the round towers, some of which still stand, solid and unshaken as at first, visible monuments of the remotest ages. The Phœnician Cosmogon y, like all others in Asia, was the Word of God, written in astral characters, by the planetar y Divinities, and com municated by the Demi-gods, as a profound m ystery, to the brighter intelligen ces of Humanit y, to be propagated by them among men. Their doctrines resemb led the Ancient Sabeism, and being the faith of Hiram the King and his namesak e the Artist, are of interest to all Mason s. With them, the First Principle was half material, half spiritual, a dark air, animated and impregna ted by the spirit; and a disordered chaos, covered with thick darkness. From this came the WORD, and thence creation and generation ; and thence a race of men, children of light, who adored Heaven and its Stars as the Supreme Being; and whose different gods were but incarnat ions of the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and the Ether.

Hence the Serpent in a circle, holding his tail in his mouth, was an emb lem of eternit y. With the head of a hawk he was of a Divine Nature, and a s ymbol of the sun. Hence one Sect of the Gnostics took him for their good genius, and hence the brazen serpent reared by Moses in the Desert, on which the Israelites looked and lived. \"Before the chaos, that preceded the birth of Heaven and Earth,\" said the Chinese Lao- Tseu, \"a single Being existed, immense and silent, immutable and always acting; the mother of the Universe.

Man has his mode l in the earth, the earth in Heaven, Heaven in Reason, and Reason in itself.\" \"I am,\" says Isis, \"Nature; parent of all things, the sovereign of the Elements, the primitive progeny of Time, the most exalted of the Deities, the first of the Heavenl y Gods and Goddesse s, the Queen of the Shades, the uniform countenance; who dispo se with my rod the numerous lights of Heaven, the salubrious breezes of the sea, and the mournful silence of the dead; whose single Divinit y the whole world venerates in man y forms, with various rites and by many names.

All things were made by Him, and without Him was not an ything made that was made. In Him was Life, and the life was the Light of man; and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not contain it.\" It is an old tradition that this passage was from an older work. A nd Philostorgius and Nicephorus state, that when the Emperor Julian undertook to rebuild the Temple, a stone was taken up, that covered the mouth of a deep square cave, into which one of the laborers, being let down by a rope, found in the centre of the floor a cubical pillar, on which lay a roll or book, wrapped in a fine linen cloth, in which, in capital letters, was the foregoing passage. However this m ay have been, it is plain that John's Gospel is a polemi c against the Gnostics; and, stating at the outset the current doctrine in regard to the creation by the Word, he then addresses himse lf to show and urge that this Word was Jesus Christ. And the first sentence, fully-rendered into our language, would read thus: \"When the process of eman ation, of creation or evolution of existences inferior to the Supreme God began, the Word came int o existence and wa s: and this word was [τρο ς τον Θεον] near to God; i.e. the immediate or first eman ation from God: and it was God Himself, developed or manifested in that particular mode, and in action. And by that Word every thing that is was created.\" – And thus Tertulli an says that God mad e the World out of nothing, b y means of His Word, Wisdom, or Power. To Philo the Jew, as to the Gnostics, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light , or Archetype of Light , – Source whence the rays emanate that illuminate Souls. He is the Soul of the World, and as such acts ever ywhere. He himself fills and bounds his whole existence, and his forces fill and penetrate everything. His Image is the WORD [LO GOS], a form more brilliant than fire, which is not pure light. This WORD dwells in God; for it is within His Intelligence that the Suprem e Being frames for Himself the Types of Ideas of all that is to assume reality in the Universe. The WORD is the Vehicle by which God acts on the Universe; the World of Ideas by means whereof God has created visible things; the more Ancient God, as comp ared with the Material World; Chief and General Representativ e of all Intelligen ces; the Arch-angel, type and representative of all spirits, even those of Mortals; the type of Man; the primitive man himself. These ideas are borrowed from Plato. And this WORD is not onl y the Creator [\" by Him wa s everything made that was m ade \"], but acts in the place of God; and through him act all the Powers and Attributes of God. And also, as first representativ e of the human race, he is the protector of Men and their Shepherd, the \"Ben H’Adam,\" or Son of Man.

His unruly passions have caused him to fall from his original lofty estate.

The Supreme Being of the Egyptians was A m ū n , a secret and concealed God, the Unknown Father of the Gnostics, the Source of Divine Life, and of all force, the Plenitude of all, comprehending all things in Himself, the original Light. He creates nothing; but everything emanates from Him: and all other Gods are but his man ifestations. From Him, by the utterance of a Word, eman ated Neith , the Divine Mother of all things, the Primitive THOUGHT, the FORCE that puts every thing in move ment, the SPIRIT every where extended, the Deity of Light and Mother of the Sun . Of this Supreme Being, Osiris was the image, Source of all Good in the moral and ph ysical world, and constant foe of Typhon, the Genius of Evil, the Satan of Gnosticism , brute matter, deemed to be alwa ys at feud with the spirit that flowed from the Deit y; and over whom Har-Geri, the Redeemer, Son of Isis and Osiris, is finall y to prevail. In the Zend-Avesta of the Persians the Supreme Being is Time without limit , ZERUA NE AKHERENE. – No origin could be assigned to Him; for He was enveloped in His own Glory, and His Nature and Attributes were so inaccessible to human Intellig ence, that He was but the object of a silent veneration. The com mencement of Creation was by emanation from Him. The first emanation was the Primitive Light, and from this Light emerged Ormuzd , the King of Light , who, by the WORD, created the World in its purit y, is its Preserver and Judge, a Holy and Sacred Being, Intelligence and Kno wledge, Himself Time without li mit, and wielding all the powers of the Supreme Being. In this Persian faith, as taught many centuries before our era, and embodied in the Zend- Avesta, there was in man a pure Principle, proceeding from the Supreme Being, produced by the Will and Word of Ormuzd. To that was united an impure principle, proceeding from a foreign influence, that of Ahrim an, the Dragon, or principle of Evil. Tempted by Ahriman, the first man and woman had fallen; and for twelve thousand ye ars there was to be war between Ormuzd and the Good Spirits created by him, and Ahriman and the Evil ones whom he had called into existence. But pure souls are assisted b y the Good Spirits, the Triu mph of the Good P rinciple is determined upon in the decrees of the Supreme Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibly arrive. At the moment when the earth shall be most afflicted with the evils brought upon it b y the Spirits of perdition, three Prophets will appear to bring assistance to mortals. Sosiosch, Chief of the Three, will regenerate the world, and restore to it its primitive Beauty, Strength, and Purity . He will judge the good and the wicked. After the universal resurrection of the Good, the pure Spirits will conduct them to an abode of eternal happiness. Ahriman, his evil Demons, and all the world, will be purified in a torrent of liquid burning metal. The Law of Ormuzd will rule ever ywhere: all men will be happy : all, enjoying an unalterab le bliss, will unite with Sosiosch in singing the praises of the Supreme Being.

Apollonius of Tyana says: \"We shall render the most appropriate worship to the Deity, when to that God whom we call the First, who is O ne, and separate from all, and after whom we recognize the others, we present no offerings whatever, kindle to Him no fire, dedicate to Him no sensible thing; for he needs nothing, even of all that natures more exalted than ours could give. The earth produces no plant, the air nourishes no anima l, there is in short nothing, which would not be impure in his sight. In ad-dres sing ourselves to Him, we must use onl y the higher word, that, I mean, which is not expressed by the mouth, the silent inner word of the spirit From the most Glorious of all Beings, we must seek for blessings, b y that which is most glorious in ourselves; and that is the spirit, which needs no organ.\" Strabo says: \"This one Supreme Essence is that which embr aces us all, the water and the land, that which we call the Heavens, the World, the Nature of things. This Highest Being should be worshipped, without any visible image, in sacred groves. In such retreats the devout should lay themselves down to sleep, and expect signs from God in drea ms.\" Aristotle says: \"It has been handed down in a mythical form, from the earliest times to posterit y, that there are Gods, and that The Divine compasses entire nature. All besides this has been added, after the mythical style, for the purpose of persuading the multitude, and for the interest of the laws and the advantage of the State. Thus men have given to the Gods human forms, and have even represented them under the figure of other beings, in the train of which fictions followed many more of the same sort. But if, from all this, we separate the original principle, and consider it alone, namely, that the first Essences are Gods, we s hall find that this has been divinel y said; and since it is probable that philosoph y and the arts have been several times, so far as that is possible, found and lost, such doctrines may have been preserved to our ti mes as the remains of ancient wisdom.\" Porphyry says: \"By images addressed to sense, the ancients represented God and his powers – by the visible they typified the invisible for those who had learned to read, in these types, as in a book, a treatise on the Gods. We need not wonder if the ignorant consider the images to be nothing mor e than wood or stone; for just so, they who are ignorant of writing see nothing in monu ments but stone, nothing in tablets but wood, and in books but a tissue of pap yrus.\" Apollonius of Tyana held, that birth and death are onl y in appearance; that which separates itself from the one substance (the one Divine essence), and is caught up by matter, seems to be born; that, again, which releases itself from the bonds of ma tter, and is reunited with the one Divine Essence, seems to die. There is, at most, an alterat ion between becom ing visible and beco ming invisible. In all there is, properly speaking, but the one essence, which alone acts and suffers, by becoming all things to all; the Eternal God, whom men wrong, when they deprive Him of what properly can be attribut ed to Him only, and transfer it to other nam es and persons. The New Platonists substituted the idea of the Absolute, for the Supreme Essence itself; – as the first, simpl est principle, anterior to all existence; of which nothing determ inate can Page 206 of 621"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike be predicated; to which no consciousness, no self-conte mplation can be ascribed; inasmu ch as to do so, would im mediately imply a qualit y, a distinction of subject and object. This Supreme Entity can be known only by an intell ectual intuition of the Spirit, transcending itself, and emancip ating itself from its own li mits. This mere logical tendenc y, by means of which men thought to arrive at the conception of such an absolute, the ὄ ν, was united with a certain mysticism, which, by a transcendent state of feeling, communicated, as it were, to this abstraction what the mind would receive as a realit y. The absorption of the Spirit into that superexistence (τ ὸ ἐ πέκεινα τ ῆ ς ο ὐ σίας), so as to be entirel y identified with it, or such a revelation of the latter to the spirit raised above itself, was regarded as the highest end which the spiritual life could reach. The New Platonists' idea of God, was that of One Simple Original Essence, exalted above all pluralit y and all becom ing; the only true Being; unchangeable, eternal [ Ἑ ις ὤ ν ἑ ν ὶ τ ῷ ν ῦ ν τ ὸ ἀ ε ὶ πεπλ ή ρωκε κα ὶ μ ό νον ἐ στι τ ὸ κατ ὰ το ῦ τον ὄ ντως ὣ ν.]: from whom all Existence in its several gradations has emana ted – the world of God s, as nearest akin to Himself, being first, and at the head of all. In these God s, tha t perfection, which in the Supreme Essence was inclosed and unevolved, is expanded and becomes knowable. They serve to exhibit in different forms the image of that Supreme Essence, to which no soul can rise, except by the loftiest flight of conte mplation; and after it has rid itself from all that pertains to sense – from all manifoldn ess. The y are the mediators between man (amazed and stupefied b y manifoldness) and the Supreme Unity. Philo says: \"He who disbelieves the miraculous, simply as the mir aculous, neither knows God, nor has he ever sought after Him ; for otherwise he would have understood, by looking at that trul y great and awe-inspiring sight, the miracle of the Universe, that these miracles (in God 's providential guidance of His people) are but child's pla y for the Divine Power. But the truly miracu lous has become despised through fam iliarity. The universal, on the contrar y, although in itself insignificant, yet, through our love of novelt y, transports us with am azement.\" In opposition to the anthropopathism of the Jewish Scriptures, the Alexandrian Jews endeavored to purify the idea of God from all admixture of the Human. By the exclusion of every human passion, it was sublimated to a something devoid of all attributes, and wholly transcendenta l; and the mer e Being [ ὄ ν], the Good, in and by itself, the Absolute of Platonis m, was sub stituted for the personal Deity [ יהוה ] of the Old Testa ment. By soaring upward, be yond all created existence, the mind, disengaging itself from the Sensible, attains to the intell ectual intuition of this Absolute Being; of whom, however, it can predicate nothing but existence, and sets aside all other deter minations as not answering to the exalted nature of the Supreme Essence. Thus Philo makes a distinct ion between those who are in the proper sense Sons of G od, having by means of conte mplation raised the mselves to the highest Being, or attain ed to a knowledge of Him, in His im mediate self-manifest ation, and those who know G od only in his med iate revelation through his operation – such as He declares Himself in creation – in the revelation still veiled in the letter of Scripture – those, in short, who attach themselv es Page 207 of 621"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike simply to the Logos, and consider this to be the Supreme God; who are the sons of the Logos, rather than of the True Being, ὄ ν. \"God,\" say s Pythagoras, \"is neither the object of sense, nor subject to passion, but invisible, only intellig ible, and supremel y intelligen t. In His body He is like the light , and in His soul He resemb les truth. He is the universal spirit that pervades and diffuseth itself over all nature. All beings receive their life from Him. There is but one only God, who is not, as some are apt to imagine, seated above the world, beyond the orb of the Universe; but being Himself all in all, He sees all the beings that fill His im mensity; the only Principle, the Light of Heaven, the Father of all. He produces everything ; He order s and disposes every thing; He is the REASON, the LIFE, and the MOTION of all being.\" \"I am the LIGHT of the world; he that followeth Me shall not walk in DARKNES S, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE.\" So said the Founder of the Christian Religion, as His words are reported by John the Apostle. God, say the sacred writings of the Jews, appeared to Moses in a FLAME O F FIRE, in the midst of a bush, which was not consumed. He descended upon Mount Sinai, as the smoke of a furnace ; He went before the children of Israel, by day, in a pillar of cloud, and, b y night, in a pillar of fire , to give the m light . \"Call you on the name of your Gods,\" said Elijah the Prophet to the Priests of Baal, \"and I will call upon the nam e of ADONAI; and the God that answereth by fire , let him be God.\" According to the Kabalah, as according to the doctrines of Zoroaster, everything that exists has emanated from a source of infinite light. Before all things, existed the Primitive Being , THE ANCIENT OF D AYS, the Ancient King of Light ; a title the more remarkab le, because it is frequentl y given to the Creator in the Zend-Avesta, and in the Code of the Sabeans, and occurs in the Jewish Scriptures. The world wa s His Revelation, God revealed; and subsisted onl y in Him. His attributes were there reproduced with various modific ations and in different degrees; so that the Universe was His H oly Splendor, His Mantle. He was to be adored in silence; and perfection consisted in a nearer approach to Him. Before the creation of worlds, the PRIMITIVE LIGHT filled all space, so that there was no void. When the Supreme Being, existing in this Light, resolved to displa y His perfections, or manifest them in worlds, He withdrew within Himself, formed around Him a void space, and shot forth His first em anation, a ray of light; the cause and principle of everything that exists, uniting both the generative and conceptiv e power, which penetrates everything, and without which nothing could subsist for an instant. Man fell, seduced by the Evil Spirits most remote from the Great King of Light; those of the fourth world of spirits, Asiah, whose chief was Belial. They wage incessant war against the pure Intelligen ces of the other worlds, who, like the Amshaspands. Izeds, and Ferouers of the Persians are the tutelary guardians of man. In the beginning, all was unison and harmon y; full of the same divine light and perfect purity. The Seven Kings of Evil fell, and the Universe was troubled. Then the Creator took from the Seven Kings the principles of Good and of Light, and divided them among the four worlds of Spirits, giving to the first Page 208 of 621"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike three the Pure Intelligenc es, united in love and harmon y, while to the fourth were vouchsafed only some feeble glimmerings of light. When the strife between these and the good angels shall have continued the appointed time, and these Spirits enveloped in darkness shall long and in vain have endeavored to absorb the Divine light and life, then will the Eternal Himself come to correct them. He will deliver them from the gross envelopes of matter that hold them captive, will re- animate and strengthen the ray of light or spiritual nature which the y have preserved, and re-establish throughout the Universe that primitive Harmon y which was its bliss. Marcion, the Gnostic, said, \"The Soul of the True Christian, adopted as a child by the Supreme Being, to whom it has long been a stranger, receives from Him the Spirit and Divine life. It is led and confirm ed, by this gift, in a pure and hol y life, like that of God; and if it so comp letes its earthl y career, in charit y, chastity, and sanctit y, it will one day be disengaged from its material envelope, as the ripe grain is detached from the straw, and as the young bird escapes from its shell. Like the angels, it will share in the bliss of the Good and Perfect Father, re-clothed in an aerial body or organ, and made like unto the Angels in Heaven.\" You see, m y brother, what is the meaning of Masonic \"Light.\" You see why the EAST of the Lodge, where the initia l letter of the Name of the Deit y overhangs the Master, is the place of Light. Light, as contradistingu ished from darkness, is Good, as contradistingu ished from Evil: and it is that Light, the true knowledge of Deit y, the Eternal Good, for which Mason s in all ages have sought. Still Masonr y marches steadily onward toward that Light that shines in the great distance, the Light of that day when Evil, overcome and vanquished, shall fade awa y and disappear forever, and Life and Light be the one law of the Universe, and its eternal Harmon y. The Degree of Rose ✠ teaches three things; – the unit y, immutability and goodness of God; the immortality of the Soul; and the ulti mate defeat and extinction of evil and wrong and sorrow, by a Redee mer or Messiah, y et to com e, if he has not alread y appeared. It replaces the three pillars of the old Temp le, with three that have already been explained to you, – Faith [in God, mank ind, and man's self], Hope [in the victor y over evil, the advance ment of Humani ty, and a hereafter], and Charit y [relieving the wants. and tolerant of the errors and faults of others]. To be trustful, to be hopeful, to be indulgent; these, in an age of selfishness, of it opinion of human nature, of harsh and bitter judgmen t, are the most important Masonic Virtues, and the true supports of ever y Masonic Temple. And they are the old pillars of the Temple under different names. For he onl y is wise who ju dges others charitab ly; he only is strong who is hopeful; and there is no beauty like a firm faith in God, our fellows and our self. The second apart ment, clothed in mourning, the columns of the Temple shattered and prostrate, and the brethren bowed down in the deepest dejection, represents the world under the tyranny of the Principle of Evil; where virtue is persecuted and vice rewarded; where the righteous starve for bread, and the wicked live sumptuousl y and dress in purple and fine linen; where insolent ignorance rules, and learning and genius serve; where King and Priest trample on libert y and the rights of conscience; where freedom hides in caves Page 209 of 621"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and mountains, and sycophan cy and servilit y fawn and thrive; where the cry of the widow and the orphan starving for want of food, and shivering with cold, rises ever to Heaven, from a million miserable hovels; where men, willing to labor, and starving, they and their children and the wives of their bosoms, beg plaintive ly for work, when the pamp ered capitalist stops his mi lls; where the law punishes her who, starving, steals a loaf, and lets the seducer go free; where the success of a party justifies murder, and violence and rapine go unpunished; and where he who with many years' cheating and grinding the faces of the poor grows rich, receives office and honor in life, and after death brave funeral and a splendid mausoleu m: – this world, where, since its making, war ha s never ceased, nor man paused in the sad task of torturing and murdering his brother; and of which amb ition, avarice, envy, hatred, lust, and the rest of Ahriman's and Typhon's army make a Pandemon ium: this world, sunk in sin, reeking with baseness, cla morous with sorrow and misery.

The obligations of our Ancient Brethren of the Rose ✠ were to fulfill all the duties of friendship, cheerfulness, charity, peace, liberalit y, temperance and chastit y: and scrupulousl y to avoid i mpurity, haughtiness, hatred, anger, and every other kind of vice.

Listen, my brother, to our explanation of the s ymbols of the Degree, and then give them such further interpretat ion as you think fit. The Cross has been a sacred symbol from the earliest Antiquity. It is found upon all the enduring monum ents of the world, in Egypt, in Assyria, in Hindostan, in Persia, and on the Buddhist towers of Ireland. Buddha was said to have died upon it. The Druids cut an oak into its shape and held it sacred, and built their temples in that form. Pointing to the four quarters of the world, it was the s ymbol of universal nature. It was on a crucifor m tree, that Chrishna was said to have expired, pierced with arrows. It was revered in Mexico. But its peculiar meaning in this Degree, is that given to it by the Ancient Egyptians. Thoth or Phtha is represented on the oldest monum ents carrying in his hand the Crux Ansata , or Ankh , [a Tau cross, with a ring or circle over it]. He is so seen on the double tablet of Shufu and Noh Shufu, builders of the greatest of the Pyramids, at Wad y Meghara, in the peninsula of Sinai. It was the hierogl yphic for life , and with a triangle prefixed m eant life- giving . To us therefore it is the symbol of Life – of that life that emanated from the Deity, and of that Eternal Life for which we all hope; through our faith in God 's infinite goodnes s. The ROSE, was ancientl y sacred to Aurora and the Sun. It is a symbol of Dawn , of the resurrection of Light and the renewal of life, and therefore of the dawn of the first day, and more particularl y of the resurrection: and the Cross and Rose together are therefore hieroglyphically to be read, the Dawn of Eternal Life which all Nations have hoped for by the advent of a Redeem er.

This is the Staff of Osiris, also, and his monogram , and was adopted b y the Christians as a Sign.

There is no human soul that is not sad at ti mes. There is no thoughtful soul that does not at times despair. There is perhaps none, of all that think at all of anything beyond the needs and interests of the body, that is not at times startled and terrified by the awful questions which, feeling as though it were a guilt y thing for doing so, it whispers to itself in its inmost depths. Some Demon seems to torture it with doubts, and to crush it with despair, asking whether, after all, it is certain that its convictions are true, and its faith well founded: whether it is indeed sure that a God of Infinite Love and Beneficence rules the Universe, or onl y some great remorseless Fate and iron Necessit y, hid in impene trable gloom, and to which men and their sufferings and sorrows, their hopes and j oys, their ambitions and deeds, are of no mor e interest or impor tance than the mot es that dance in the sunshine; or a Being that amuses Himself with the incredible vanity and foll y, the writhings and contortions of the insignificant insects that compose Humanity, and idl y imagin e that they resemble the Omnipotent. \"What are we,\" the Tempter asks, \"but puppets in a show- box?

What, to immense numbers of men, would be the value of a Heaven where they could not lie and libel, and ply base avocations for profitable returns ? Sadly we look around us, and read the gloom y and drear y records of the old dead and rotten ages. More than eighteen centuries have staggered away into the spectral realm of the Past, since Christ, teaching the Religion of Love, was crucified, that it might becom e a Religion of Hate; and His Doctrines are not yet even nominal ly accepted as true b y a fourth of mank ind. Since His death, what incalculabl e swarms of human beings have lived and died in total unbelief of all that we dee m essential to Salvation! What multitudinous myriads of souls, since the darknes s of idolatrous superstition settled down, thick and impenetrable, upon the earth, have flocked up toward the eternal Throne of God, to receive His judgmen t? The Religion of Love proved to be, for seventeen long centuries, as much the Religion of Elate, and infinitel y more the Religion of Persecution, than Mahometan ism, its unconquerable rival. Heresies grew up before the Apostles died; and God hated the Nicolait ans, while John, at Patmos, proclaim ed His coming wrath. Sects wrangled, and each, as it gained the power, persecuted the other, until the soil of the whole Christian world was watered with the blood, and fattened on the flesh, and whitened with the bones, of martyrs, and human ingenuit y, was taxed to its utmost to invent new modes by which tortures and agonies could be pro-longed and mad e more exquisite. \"By what right,\" whispers the Voice, '\"does this savage, merc iless, persecuting animal, to which the sufferings and writhings of others of its wretched kind furnish the most pleasurable sensations, and the mass of which care only to eat, sleep, be clothed, and wallow in sensual pleasures, and the best of which wrangle, hate, envy, and, with few exceptions, regard their own interests alone, – with what right does it endeavor to delude itself into the conviction that it is not an ani mal, as the wolf, the hyena, and the tiger are, but a somewhat nobler, a spirit destined to be im mortal, a spark of the essential Light, Fire and Reason, w hich are God? What other immortality than one of selfishness could this creature enjoy? Of what other is it capable? Must not im mortality commence here and is not life a part of it? Ho w shall death change the base nature of the base soul ? Why have not those other ani mals that only faintly imitate the wanton, savage, human cruelty and thirst for blood, the same right as man has, to expect a resurrection and an Eternit y of existence, or a Heaven of Love? The world improves . Man ceases to persecute, – when the persecuted become too numerous and strong, longer to submit to it.

Where the armies of the despots cease to slay and ravage, the armies of \"Freedom\" take their place, and, the black and white commingled, slaughter and burn and ravish. Each age re-enacts the crimes as well as the follies of its predecessors, and still war licenses outrage and turns fruitful lands into deserts, and God is thanked in the Churches for blood y butcheries, and the remorse less devastators, even when s wollen by plunder, are crowned with laurels and receive ovations. Of the whole of mankind, not one in ten thousand has an y aspirations be yond the dail y needs of the gross animal life.

For them, God, Soul, Spirit, immortality, are mer e words, without any real meaning. The God of nineteen- twentieths of the Christian world is only Bel, Moloch, Zeus, or at best Osiris, Mithras, or Adonaï, under another na me, worshipped with the old Pagan ceremon ies and ritualist ic formulas. it is the Statue of Olympian Jove, worshipped as the Father, in the Christian Church that was a Pagan Te mple; it is the Statue of Venus, become the Virgin Mary . For the most part, men do not in their hearts believe that God is either just or mer ciful. They fear and shrink from His lightnings and dread his wrath. For the most part, they only think they believe that there is another life, a judgment, and a punishment for sin. Yet the y will none the less persecute as Infidels and Atheists those who do not believe what the y themse lves imagine they believe, and which y et they do not believe, because it is inco mprehensib le to them in their ignorance and want of intellect. To the vast majorit y of mankind, God is but the reflected image, in infinite space, of the earthly Tyrant on his Throne, only more powerful, more inscrutable, and more implacable. To curse Humani ty, the Despot need onl y be, what the popular mind has, in every age, im agined God. In the great cities, the lower strata of the populace are equally without faith and without hope.

Faith and Reason are not opposites, in equilibriu m; but antagonistic and hostile to each other; the result being the darknes s and despair of scepticis m, avowed, or half-veiled as rationalis m. Over more than three- fourths of the habitable globe, human ity still kneels, like the camels, to take upon itself the burthens to be tame ly borne for its ty rants. If a Republic occasionall y rises like a Star, it hastens with all speed to set in blood. The kings need not make war upon it, to crush it out of their way.

Everywhere in the world labor is, in some shape, the slave of capita l; generall y, a slave to be fed only so long as he can work; or, rather, only so long as his work is profitable to the owner of the human chattel.

Here, a sewing-woman famishes and freezes; there, mothers murder their children, that those spared may live upon the bread purchased with the burial allowances of the dead starveling; and at the next door yo ung girls prostitute themselves for food. Moreover, the Voice says, this besotted race is not satisfied with seeing its multitudes swept awa y by the great epidem ics whose causes are unknown, and of the justice or wisdom of which the human mind cannot conceive. It must also be ever at war. There has not been a mo ment since men divided into Tribes, when all the world was at peace. Always men have been engaged in murdering each other somewhere. Always the armies have lived by the toil of the husbandman, and war has exhausted the resources, wasted the energies, and ended the prosperity of Nations. Now it loads unborn po sterity with crushing debt, mortgages all estates, and brings upon States the shame and infam y of dishonest repudiation. At times, the baleful fires of war light up half a Continent at once; as when all the Thrones unite to compel a people to receive again a hated and detestable dynasty, or States den y States the right to dissolve an irksome union and create for the mselves a separate governm ent. Then again the flames flicker and die awa y, and the fire smoulders in its ashes, to break out again, after a time, with renewed and a more concentrat ed fury. At times, the storm, revolving, howls over small areas onl y; at times its lights are seen, like the old beacon- fires on the hills, belting the whole globe. No sea, but hears the roar of cannon; no river, but runs red with blood; no plain, but shakes, tramp led by the hoofs of charging squadrons; no field, but is fertili zed by the blood of the dead; and every where man slays, the vulture gorges, and the wolf howls in the ear of the dying soldier. No city is not tortured by shot and shell; and no people fail to enact the horrid blasphem y of thanking a God of Love for victories and carnage. Te Deums are still sung for the Eve of St. Bartholo mew and the Sicilian Vespers. Man's ingenuit y is racked, and all his inventive powers are tasked, to fabricate the infernal enginery of destruction, by which human bodies may be the more expeditiousl y and effectual ly crushed, shattered, torn, and mangl ed; and yet hypocritical Humanit y, drunk with blood and drenched with gore, shrieks to Heaven at a single murder, perpetrated to gratify a revenge not more unchristian, or to satisfy a cupidity not more ignoble, than those which are the promptings of the Devil in the souls of Nations.

We lie down to sleep, like the peasant on the lava-slopes of Ve suvius. The mounta in has been so long inert, that we believe its fires extinguished. Round us hang the clustering grapes, and the green leaves of the olive tremble in the soft night- air over us. A bove us shine the peaceful, patient stars. The crash of a new eruption wakes us, the roar of the subterranean thunders, the stabs of the volcanic lightning into the shrouded bosom of the sky; and we see, aghast, the tortured Titan hurling up its fires among the pale stars, its great tree of smoke and cloud, the red torrents pouring down its sides. The roar and the shriekings of Civil War are all around us: the land is a pandemon ium: man is again a Savage. The great armies roll along their hideous waves, and leave behind them smoking and depopulated deserts. The pillager is in ever y house, plucking even the morsel of bread from the lips of the starving child. Gray hairs are dabbled in blood, and innocent girlhood shrieks in vain to Lust for mercy. Laws, Courts, Constitutions, Christianit y, Mercy, Pity, disappear. God seems to have abdicated, and Moloch to reign in His stead; while Press and Pulpit alike exult at universal murder, and urge the exterm ination of the Conquered, b y the sword and the flaming torch; and to plunder and murder entitles the human beasts of pre y to the thanks of Christian Senates. Commercial greed deadens the nerves of s ympathy of Nations, and makes them deaf to the demands of honor, the i mpulses of generosit y, the appeals of those who suffer under injustice. Elsewhere, the universal pursuit of wealth dethrones God and pays divine honors to Mamm on and Baalzebub. Selfishness rules supreme: to win wealth becom es the whole business of life. The villani es of legalized gaming and speculation become epidem ic; treacher y is but evidence of shrewdnes s; office becomes the prey of successful faction; the Country, like Actæon, is torn b y its own hounds, and the villains it has carefull y educated to their trade, most greedil y plunder it, when it is in extremis . By what right, the Voice demands, does a creature always engaged in the work of mutua l robbery and slaughter, and who makes his own interest his God, claim to be of a nature superior to the savage beasts of which he is the protot ype? Then the shadows of a horrible doubt fall upon the soul that would fain love, trust and believe; a darkness, of which this that surrounded you was a symbol. It doubts the truth of Revelat ion, its own spiritualit y, the very existence of a beneficen t God. It asks itself if it is not idle to hope for an y great progress of H umanity toward perfection, and whether, when it advances in one respect, it does not retrogress in some other, b y way of compensa tion: whether advance in civiliz ation is not increase of selfishness: whether freedom does not necessaril y lead to license and anarch y: whether the destitution and debasemen t of the masses does not inevitab ly follow increase of population and com mercial and manufacturing prosperit y. It asks itself whether man is not the sport of a blind, mer ciless Fate: whether all philosophies are not delusions, and all religions the fantastic creations of human vanity and self-conceit ; and, above all, whether, when Reason is abandoned as a guide, the faith of Buddhist and Brahmin has not the same claims to sovereignt y and implicit, unreasoning credence, as any other.

Doubting m an's capacity for indefinite progres s here, he doubts the possibility of it an ywhere; and if he does not doubt whether God exists, and is just and beneficent, he at least cannot silence the constantl y recurring whisper, that the miseries and calam ities of men, their lives and deaths, their pains and sorrow s, their extermination by war and epidem ics, are phenomena of no higher dignity, significance, and import ance, in the e ye of God, than what things of the same nature occur to other organisms of matter; and that the fish of the ancient seas, destroyed by myriads to make room for other species, the contorted shapes in which they are found as fo ssils testif ying to their agonies; the coral insects, the ani mals and birds and vermin slain by man, have as much right as he to clamor at the injustice of the dispensations of God, and to demand an immortality of life in a new universe, as compensation for their pains and sufferings and unti mely death in this world. This is not a picture painted by the imagination. Many a thoughtful mind has so doubted and despaired. How man y of us can sa y that our own faith is so well grounded and complete that we never hear those painful whisperings within the soul ? Thrice blessed are they who never doubt, who rumina te in patient content ment like the kine, or doze under the opiate of a blind faith; on whose souls never rests that Awful Shadow w hich is the absence of the Divine Light. To explain to themselves the existence of Evil and Suffering, the Ancient Persians imagined that there were two Principles or Deities in the Universe, the one of Good and the other of Evil, constantl y in conflict with each other in struggle for the master y, and alternately overcoming and overcom e. Over both, for the SAGES, was the One Supreme ; and for them Light was in the end to prevail over Darknes s, the Good over the Evil, and even Ahriman and his Demons to part with their wicked and vicious natures and share the universal Salvation. It did not occur to them that the existence of the Evil Principle, by the consent of the Omnipo tent Supreme, presented the same difficult y, and left the existence of Evil as unexplained as before. The human mind is alway s content, if it can remove a difficult y a step further off. It cannot believe that the world rests on nothing, but is devoutl y content when taught that it is borne on the back of an i mmense elephant, who himself stands on the back of a tortoise. Given the tortoise, Faith is alway s satisfied; and it has been a great source of happiness to mu ltitudes that they could believe in a Devil who could relieve God of the odium of being the Author of Sin. But not to all is Faith sufficient to overco me this great difficult y. They say, with the Suppliant, \" Lord! I believe! \" – but like him they are constrained to add, \" Help Thou my unbelief! \" – Reason must, for these, co-operate and coincide with Faith, or they remain still in the darkness of doubt, – most miserabl e of all conditions of the human mind. Those, only, who care for nothing beyond the interests and pursuits of this life, are uninterested in these great Proble ms. The ani mals, also, do not consider them. It is the character istic of an im mortal Soul, that it should seek to satisf y itself of its immortality, and to understand this great enigma, the Universe.

Exalt and magnif y Faith as we will, and say that it begins where Reason ends, it must, after all, have a foundation, either in Reason, Analogy, the Consciousness, or human testimony. The worshipper of Brahma also has impl icit Faith in what seems to us palpabl y false and absurd. His faith rests neither in Reason, Analog y, or the Consciousness, but on the testimony of his S piritual teachers, and of the Holy Books. The Moslem also believes, on the positive testimony of the Prophet; and the Mormon also can say, \" I believe this, because it is impossible .\" No faith, however absurd or degrading, has ever wanted these foundations, testimony, and the books. Miracles, proven by unimpea chable testimony have been used as a foundation for Faith, in every age; and the modern miracles are better authenti cated, a hundred ti mes, than the ancient ones. So that, after all, Faith must flow out from some source within us, when the evidence of that which we are to believe is not presented to our senses, or it will in no case be the assurance of the truth of what is believed. The Consciousnes s, or inhering and innate conviction, or the instinct divinel y implanted, of the verity of things, is the highest possible evidence, if not the only real proof, of the verity of certain things, but onl y of truths of a li mited class. What we call the Reason, that is, our imperf ect human reason, not only may, but assuredly will, lead us away from the Truth in regard to things invisible and especiall y those of the Infinite, if we determ ine to believe nothing but that which it can demonstrat e. or not to believe that which it can by its processes of logic prove to be contradictor y, unreasonable, or absurd. Its tape- line cannot measure the arcs of Infinit y. For examp le, to the Human reason, an Infinite Justice and an Infinite Mercy or Love, in the same Being, are inconsistent and impossible. One, it can demonstrat e, necessaril y excludes the other.

When we gaze, of a moonless clear night, on the Heavens glitter ing with stars, and kno w that each fixed star of all the myriads is a Sun, and each probably possessing its retinue of worlds, all peopled with living beings, we sensibly feel our own unimport ance in the scale of Creation, and at once reflect that much of what has in different ages been religious faith, could never have been believed, if the nature, size, and distance of those Suns, and of our own Sun, M oon, and Planets, had been known to the Ancients as they are to us. To them, all the lights of the firm ament were created only to give light to the earth, as its lamps or candles hung above it. The earth was supposed to be the only inhabited portion of the Universe. The world and the Universe were sy nonymous terms. Of the im mense size and distance of the heavenl y bodies, men had no conception. The Sages had, in Chaldæa, Egypt, India, China, and in Persia, and therefore the sages alway s had, an esoteric creed, taught only in the m ysteries and unknown to the vulgar. No Sage, in either country, or in Greece or Rome, believed the popular creed. To them the Gods and the Idols of the Gods were symbols, and symbols of great and mysterious truths.

God cam e down from Heaven and on Sinai dictat ed laws for the Hebrews to His servant Moses. The Stars were the guardians of mor tals whose fates and fortunes were to be read in their movem ents, conjunctions, and oppositions. The Moon wa s the Bride and Sister of the Sun, at the same distance above the Earth, and, like the Sun, made for the service of mankind alone. If, with the great telescope of Lord Rosse, we exa mine the vast nebula of Hercules, Orion, and Androméd a, and find them resolvable into Stars more numerous than the sands on the seashore; if we reflect that each of these Stars is a Sun, like and even man y times larger than ours, – each, be yond a doubt, with its retinue of worlds s warming with life; – if we go further in imagination, and endeavor to conceive of all the infinities of space, filled with similar suns and worlds, we seem at once to shrink into an incredible insignifican ce. The Universe, which is the uttered Word of God, is infinite in extent. There is no emp ty space beyond creation on any side. The Universe, which is the Thought of God pronounced, never was not , since God never was inert; nor WA S, without thinking and creating. The forms of creation change, the suns and worlds live and die like the leaves and the insects, but the Universe itself is infinite and eternal, because God Is, Was, and Will forever Be, and never did not think and create. Reason is fain to adm it that a Supreme Intellig ence, infinitel y powerful and wise, must have created this boundless Universe; but it also tells us that we are as unimport ant in it as the zoöphy tes and entozoa, or as the invisible particles of anim ated life that float upon the air or swarm in the water-drop. The foundations of our faith, resting upon the imagin ed interest of God in our race, an interest easily supposable when man believed himself the only intelligent created being, and therefore eminen tly worthy the especial care and watchful anxiety of a God who had only this earth to look after, and its house-keeping alone to superintend, and who was content to create, in all the infinite Universe, only one single being, posses sing a soul, and not a mere animal, are rudely shaken as the Universe broadens and expands for u s; and the darkness of doubt and distrust settles heavy upon the Soul.

To tell us that the animals possess instinct only and that Reason belongs to us alone, in no way tends to satisfy us of the radical difference between us and them. For if the men tal phenom ena exhibited by animals that think, dream, remember, argue from cause to effect, plan, devise, comb ine, and comm unicate their thoughts to each other, so as to act rationall y in concert, if their love, hate, and revenge, can be conceived of as results of the Page 220 of 621"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike organizat ion of matter, like color and perfum e, the resort to the hypothesis of an immaterial Soul to explain phenomena of the same kind, onl y more perfect, manifested by the human being, is supremel y absurd.

Is there no mode of escaping from the labyrinth except by means of a blind faith, which explains nothing, and in many creeds, ancient and modern, sets Reason at defiance, and leads to the belief either in a God without a Universe, a Universe without a God, or a Universe which is itself a God?

There must be for every Force a Resistance to support it, to ever y light a shadow, for ever y Royalty a Realm to govern, for ever y affirma tive a negative. For the Kabalists, Light represents the Active Principle, and Darkness or Shadow is analogous to the Passive Principle. Therefore it was that they made of the Sun and Moon emblems of the two Divine Sexes and the two creativ e forces; therefore, that they ascribed to woman the Temptation and the first sin, and then the first labor, the matern al labor of the redemp tion, because it is from the bosom of the darkness itself that we see the Light born again. The Void attracts the Full; and so it is that the abyss of povert y and miser y, the Seeming Evil, the seeming empty nothingness of life, the temporary rebellion of the creatures, eternal ly attracts the overflowing ocean of being, of riches, of pit y, and of love. Christ comple ted the Atonemen t on the Cross by descending into Hell. Justice and Mercy are contraries. If each be infinite, their co-existence seems impossible, and being equal, one cannot even annihilate the other and reign alone. The mysteries of the Divine Nature are beyond our finite comprehension; but so indeed are the mysteries of our own finite nature; and it is certain that in all nature harmon y and movem ent are the result of the equilibrium of oppo sing or contrar y forces. The analog y of contraries gives the solution of the most interesting and most difficult problem of modern philosophy , – the definite and per manent accord of Reason and Faith, of Authorit y and Libert y of examination, of Science and Belief, of Perfection in God and Imperfection in Man. If science or knowledge is the Sun, Belief is the Man; it is a reflection of the day in the night. Faith is the veiled Isis, the Supplem ent of Reason, in the shadows w hich precede or follow Reason. It emanates from the Reason, but can never confound it nor be confounded with it. The encroachm ents of Reason upon Faith, or of Faith on Reason, are eclipses of the Sun or M oon; when they occur, they make useless both the Source of Light and its reflection, at once. Science perishes by systems that are nothing but beliefs; and Faith succumbs to reasoning. For the two Columns of the Temple to uphold the edifice, they must remain separated and be parallel to each other. As soon as it is attem pted by violence to bring them together, as Samson did, they are overturned, and the whole edifice falls upon the head of the rash blind man or the revolutionist whore personal or national resentmen ts have in advance devoted to death. Harmon y is the result of an alternat ing preponderance of forces. Whenever this is wanting in government, government is a failure, because it is either Despotism or Anarchy . All theoreti cal governments, however plausible the theor y, end in one or the other. Governmen ts that are to endure are not made in the closet of Locke or Shaftesbur y, or in a Congress or a Convention. In a Republic, forces that seem contraries, that indeed are contraries, alone give movem ent and life. The Spheres are held in their orbits and made to revolve harmon iously and unerringl y, by the concurrence, which seems to be the Page 222 of 621"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike opposition, of two contrar y forces. If the centripetal force should overco me the centrifugal, and the equilibriu m of forces cease, the rush of the Spheres to the Central Sun would annihila te the system. Instead of consolidation, the whole would be shattered into fragments. Man is a free agent, though Omnipot ence is above and all around hi m. To be free to do good, he must be free to do evil. The Light necessitat es. the Shadow. A State is free like an individual in any govern ment worthy of the nam e. The State is less potent than the Deity, and therefore the freedo m of the individual citizen is consistent with its Sovereignt y. These are opposites, but not antagonistic. So, in a union of States, the freedo m of the States is consistent with the Supremac y of the Nation. When either obtains the permanen t mastery over the other, and the y cease to be in equilibrio , the encroachm ent continues with a velocity that is accelerat ed like that of a falling body, until the feebler is annihilat ed, and then, there being no resistance to support the stronger, it rushes into ruin. So, when the equipoise of Reason and Faith, in the individual or the Nation, and the alternating preponderance cease, the result is, according as one or the other is permanen t victor, Atheism or Super stition, disbelief or blind credulit y; and the Priests either of Unfaith or of Faith become despotic. \" Whomsoever God loveth, him he chasteneth ,\" is an expression that formulat es a whole dogma. The trials of life are the blessings of life, to the individual or the Nation, if either has a Soul that is trul y worthy of salvation. \" Light and da rkness ,\" said ZOROASTER, \" are the world 's eternal ways .\" The Light and the Shadow are ever ywhere and alwa ys in proportion; the Light being the reason of being of the Shadow. It is b y trials only, by the agonies of sorrow and the sharp discipline of adversities, that men and Nations attain initiation. The agonies of the garden of Gethsemane and those of the Cross on Calvar y preceded the Resurrection and were the means of Rede mption. It is with prosperity that God afflicts Humani ty. The Degree of Rose ✠ is devoted to and symbolizes the final triumph of truth over falsehood, of libert y over slaver y, of light over darkness, of life over death, and of good over evil. The great truth it inculcat es is, that notwithstanding the existence of Evil, God is infinitely wise, ju st, and good: that though the affairs of the world proceed by no rule of right and wrong known to us in the narrowness of our views, ye t all is right, for it is the work of God; and all evils, all miseries, all misfortunes, are but as drop s in the vast current that is sweeping onward, guided by Him, to a great and magnif icent result: that, at the appointed time, He will redee m and regenerate the world, and the Principle, the Power, and the existence of Evil will then cease; that this will be brought about by such means and instrum ents as He chooses to emp loy; whether by the merits of a Redeem er that has already appeared, or a Messiah that is yet waited for, by an incarnation of Himself, or by an inspired prophet, it does not belong to us as Mason s to decide. Let each judge and believe for himself. In the mean time, we labor to hasten the coming of that day. The morals of antiquit y, of the law of Moses and of Christianit y, are ours. We recognize every teacher of Moralit y, every Reform er, as a brother in this great work.

Laboring for these, with Faith, Hope, and Charit y as our armor, we will wait with patience for the final triumph of Good and the comple te manifesta tion of the Word of God. No one Mason has the right to measure for another, within the walls of a Masonic Temple, the degree of veneration which he shall feel for any Reform er, or the Founder of any Religion. We teach a belief in no particular creed, as we teach unbelief in none. Whatever higher attributes the Founder of the Christian Faith may, in our belief, have had or not have had, none can den y that He taught and practised a pure and elevat ed morality, even at the risk and to the ulti mate loss of His life. He was not only the benefactor of a disinherited people, but a model for mankind. Devotedl y He loved the children of Israel. To them He came, and to them alone He preached that Gospel which His disciples afterward carried among foreigners. He would fain have freed the chosen People from their spiritual bondage of ignorance and degradation. As a lover of all mankind, laying down Hi s life for the emancipation of His Brethren, He should be to all, to Christian, to Jew, and to Mahome tan, an object of gratitude and veneration. The Roman world felt the pangs of approaching dissolution. Paganism, its Temples shattered by Socrates and Cicero, had spoken its last word. The God of the Hebrews was unknown bey ond the limits of Palestine. The old religions had failed to give happiness and peace to the world. The babbling and wrangling philosophers had confounded all men's ideas, until they doubted of every thing and had faith in nothing: neither in God nor in his goodness and merc y, nor in the virtue of man, nor in themselv es. Mankind was divided into two great classes, the m aster and the slave; the powerful and the abject, the high and the low, the t yrants and the mob; and even the former were satiated with the servilit y of the latter, sunken by lassitude and despair to the lowest depths of degradation. When, lo, a voice, in the inconsiderable Roman Province of Judea proclai ms a new Gospel – a new \"God' s Word,\" to crushed, suffering, bleeding humanit y. Liberty of Thought, Equality of all men in the eye of God, universal Fraternit y! a new doctrine, a new religion; the old Primi tive Truth uttered once again! Man is once more taught to look upward to his God. N o longer to a God hid in impenetrable mystery, and infinit ely remote from human sympathy, emerging only at intervals from the darkness to smite and crush humanit y: but a God, good, kind, beneficent, and mer ciful: a rather, loving the creatures He has mad e, with a love immeasurable and exhaustless; Who feels for us, and sy mpathizes with us, and sends us pain and want and disaster onl y that they may serve to develop in us the virtues and excellen ces that befit us to live with Him hereafter. Jesus of N azareth, the \"Son of man,\" is the expounder of the new Law of Love. He calls to Him the humbl e, the poor, the Pariahs of the world. The first sentence that He pronounces blesses the world, and announces the new gospel: \"Blessed are the y that mourn for the y shall be comfor ted.\" He pours the oil of consolation and peace upon every crushed and bleeding heart. Every sufferer is His pro selyte. He shares their sorrow s, and s ympathizes with all their afflict ions.

He heals the sick and feeds the poor. He lives a mong the destitute and the friendless. \"Suffer little children,\" He said, \"to com e unto me; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven!

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.\" The Gospel of Love He sealed with His life. The cruelty of the Jewish Priesthood, the ignorant ferocity of the mob, and the Roman indifference to barbarian blood, nailed Him to the cross, and He expired uttering blessings upon humanit y.

Hear Philo, the Greek Jew. \"The contemp lative soul, unequall y guided, somet imes toward abundance and sometimes toward barrenness, though ever advancing, is illum inated by the primitive ideas, the rays that emanate from the Divine Intellig ence, whenever it ascends toward the Sublim e Treasures. When, on the contrary , it descends, and is barren, it falls within the domain of those Intelligenc es that are termed Angels... for, when the soul is deprived of the light of God, which leads it to the knowledge of things, it no longer enjoys Page 225 of 621"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike more than a feeble and secondary light, which gives it, not the understanding of things, but that of words only , as in this baser world...\" \"...

THE true Mason labors for the benefit of those who are to come after him, and for the advance ment and improvem ent of his race. That is a poor amb ition which contents itself within the limits of a single life. All men who deserve to live, desire to survive their funerals, and to live afterward in the good that they have done mank ind, rather than in the fading characters written in men's memories. Most men desire to leave some work behind them that may outlast their own day and brief generation. That is an instinctive impulse, given by God, and often found in the rudest human heart; the surest proof of the soul's immortality, and of the fundament al difference between man and the wisest brutes. To plant the trees that, after we are dead, shall shelter our children, is as natural as to love the shade of those our fathers planted. The rudest unlettered husbandman, painfull y conscious of his own inferiorit y, the poorest widowed moth er, giving her life- blood to those who pay only for the work of her needle, will toil and stint themselv es to educate their child, that he may take a higher station in the world than they; – and of such are the world' s greatest benefactors. In his influences that survive him, man becomes immortal, before the general resurrection. The Spartan mo ther, who, giving her son his s hield, said, \"WITH IT, OR U PON IT!\" afterward shared the government of Lacedæm on with the legislat ion of Lycurgus; for she too made a law, that lived after her; and she inspired the Spartan soldier y that afterward demolished the walls of Athens, and aided Alexander to conquer the Orient. The widow who gave Marion the fier y arrows to burn her own hou se, that it migh t no longer shelter the enemies of her infant country, the house where she had lain upon her husband's bosom, and where her children had been born, legislated more effectual ly for her State than Locke or Shaftesbur y, or than man y a Legislature has done, since that State won its freedo m. It was of slight import ance to the Kings of Egypt and the Monarchs of Assyria and Phœnicia, that the son of a Jewish woman, a foundling, adopted by the daughter of Sesostris Ramses, slew an Eg yptian that oppressed a Hebrew slave, and fled into the desert, to rema in there forty years. But Mo ses, who might other-wise have become Regent of Lower Egypt, known to us only by a tablet on a tomb or monum ent, became the deliverer of the Jews, and led the m forth from Egypt to the frontiers of Palestine, and made for them a law, out of which grew the Christian faith; and so has s haped the destinies of the world. He and the old Roman lawyers, with Alfred of England, the Saxon Thanes and Norman Barons, the old judges and chancellors, and the makers of the canons, lost in the mists and shado ws of the Past, these are our legislators; and we obe y the laws that they enacted. Napoleon died upon the barren rock of his exile. His bone s, borne to France by the son of a King, rest in the Hôpital des Invalides, in the great city on the Seine. His Thoughts still govern France. He, and not the People, dethroned the Bourbon, and drove the last King of Page 227 of 621"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the House of Orleans into exile. He, in his coffin, and not the People, voted the crown to the Third Napoleon; and he, and not the Generals of France and England, led their united forces against the grim Northern Despotism. Mahome t announced to the Arabian idolaters the new creed, \" There is but one God, and Mahomet, like Moses and Christ, is His Apostle .\" For man y years unaided, then with the help of his fami ly and a few friends, then with many disciples, and last of all with an ar my, he taught and preached the Koran. The religion of the wild Arabian enthusiast converting the fiery Tribes of the Great Desert, spread over Asia, built up the Saracenic dynasties, conquered Persia and India, the Greek Empire, Northern Africa, and Spain, and dashed the surges of its fierce soldier y against the battle ments of Northern Christendom. The law of Mahome t still governs a fourth of the human race; and Turk and Arab, Moor and Persian and Hindu, still obey the Prophet, and pray with their faces turned toward Mecca; and he, and not the living, rules and reigns in the fairest portions of the Orient. Confucius still enacts the law for China; and the thoughts and ideas of Peter the Great govern Russia. Plato and the other great Sages of Antiquit y still reign as the Kings of Philosoph y, and have domin ion over the human intellect. The great States men of the Past still preside in the Councils of Nations. Burke still lingers in the House of Comm ons; and Berryer's sonorou s tones will long ring in the Legislative Chambers of France. The influences of Webster and Calhoun, conflicting, rent asunder the Americ an States, and the doctrine of each is the law and the oracle speaking from the Hol y of Holies for his o wn State and all consociated with it: a faith preached and proclai med by each at the cannon's mouth and consecrated by rivers of blood. It has been well said, that when Tamerlane had builded his pyramid of fifty thousand human skulls, and wheeled away with his vast armies from the gates of Damascus, to find new conquests, and build other pyramids, a little boy was playing in the streets of Mentz, son of a poor artisan, whose apparent importan ce in the scale of beings was, compar ed with that of Tamer lane, as that of a grain of sand to the giant bulk of the earth; but Tamerlane and all his shagg y legions, that swept over the East like a hurricane, have passed awa y, and become shadows; while printing, the wonderful invention of John Fau st, the boy of Mentz, has exerted a greater influence on man's destinies and overturned more thrones and dy nasties than all the victories of all the blood-stained conquerors from Nimrod to Napoleon. Long ages ago, the Temple built by Solomon and our A ncient Brethren sank into ruin, when the Assyrian Armies sacked Jerusalem. The Hol y City is a mass of hovels cowering under the domin ion of the Crescent; and the Holy Land is a desert. The Kings of Egypt and Assyria, who w ere contempor aries of Solomon, are forgotten, and their histories mere fables. The Ancient Orient is a shattered wreck, bleaching on the shores of Tim e. The Wolf and the Jackal howl among the ruins of Thebes and of Ty re, and the sculptured images of the Temples and Palaces of Bab ylon and Nineveh are dug from their ruins and carried into strange lands. But the quiet and peaceful Order, of which the Son of a poor Phœnician Widow was one of the Grand Ma sters, with the Kings of Israel and Tyre, has continued to increase in stature and influence, defying the angr y waves of ti me and the storms of persecution. Age has not weakened its wide foundations, nor shattered its columns, nor Page 228 of 621"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike marred the beauty of its harmonious proportions. Where rude barbarians, in the ti me of Solomon, peopled inhospitable howling wildernesses, in France and Britain, and in that New World, not known to Jew or Gentile, until the glories of the Orient had faded, that Order has builded new Temp les, and teaches to its millions of Initiat es those lessons of peace, good-will, and tolerat ion, of reliance on God and confidence in man, which it learned when Hebrew and Gible mite worked side b y side on the slopes of Lebanon, and the Servant of Jehovah and the Phœnician Worshipper of Bel sat with the humbl e artisan in Council at Jerusalem. It is the Dead that govern. The Living only obey. And if the Soul sees, after death, what passes on this earth, and watches over the welfare of those it loves, then must its greatest happiness consist in seeing the current of its beneficent influences widening out from age to age, as rivulets widen into rivers, and aiding to shape the destinies of individuals, families, States, the World; and its bitterest punishment, in seeing its evil influences causing mischief and miser y, and cursing and afflicting men, long after the frame it dwelt in has become dust, and when both name and me mory are forgotten. We know not who among the Dead control our destinies. The universal human race is linked and bound together by those influences and sympathies, which in the truest sense do make men's fates. Human ity is the unit, of which the man is but a fraction. What other men in the Past have done, said, thought, makes the great iron network of circu mstance that environs and controls us all. We take our faith on trust. We think and believe as the Old Lords of Thought command us; and Reason is powerless before Authorit y. We would make or annul a particul ar contract; but the Thoughts of the dead Judges of England, living when their ashes have been cold for centuries, stand between us and that which we would do, and utterly forbid it. We would settle our estate in a particul ar way; but the prohibition of the English Parliam ent, its uttered Thought when the first or second Edward reigned, com es echoing down the long avenues of time, and tells us we s hall not exercise the power .of dispo sition as we wish. We would gain a particul ar advantage of another; and the thought of the old Roman lawyer who died before Justinian, or that of Rome's great orator Cicero, annihila tes the act, or makes the intention ineffectua l. This act, Moses forbids; that, Alfred. We would sell our land; but certain marks on a perishable paper tell us that our father or re mote ancestor ordered otherwise; and the arm of the dead, emerging from the grave, with pere mptory gesture prohibits the alienat ion. About to sin or err, the thought or wish of our dead mother, told us when we were children, by words that died upon the air in the utterance, and man y a long year were forgotten, flashes on our memory, and holds us back with a power that is resistless. Thus we obe y the dead; and thus shall the living, when we are dead, for weal or woe, obey us. The Thoughts of the Past are the Laws of the Present and the Future. That which we say and do, if its effects last not beyond our lives, is unimportan t. That which shall live when we are dead, as part of the great body of law enacted by the dead, is the onl y act worth doing, the onl y Thought worth speaking. The desire to do someth ing that shall benefit the world, when neither praise nor obloquy will reach us where we sleep soundly in the grave, is the noblest ambition entertain ed by man.

Knowing the slow processes by which the Deity brings about great results, he does not expect to reap as well as sow, in a single lifetime. It is the inflexibl e fate and noblest destiny , with rare exceptions, of the great and good, to work, and let others reap the harvest of their labors. He who does good, only to be repaid in kind, or in thanks and gratitude, or in reputation and the world's praise, is like him who loans his mone y, that he may, after certain months, receive it back with interest. To be repaid for eminen t services with slander, obloqu y, or ridicule, or at best with stupid indifference or cold ingratitude, as it is common, so it is no misfortun e, except to those who lack the wit to see or sense to apprecia te the service, or the nobilit y of soul to thank and reward with eulog y, the benefactor of his kind. His influences live, and the great Future will obe y; whether it recognize or disown the lawgiver. .

If not for slander and persecution, the Mason w ho would benefit his race must look for apathy and cold indifference in those whose good he seeks, in those who ought to seek the good of others. Except when the sluggish depths of the Human Mind are broken up and tossed as with a storm, when at the appointed time a great Reformer comes, and a new Faith springs up and grow s with supernatural energy , the progres s of Truth is slower than the growth of oaks; and he who plants need not expect to gather. The Redeemer, at His death, had twelve disciples, and one betrayed and one deserted and denied Him. It is enough for us to know that the fruit will come in its due season. When, or who s hall gather it, it does not in the least concern us to know. It is our business to plant the seed. It is God' s right to give the fruit to whom He pleases; and if not to us, then is our action by so much the more noble. To sow, that others ma y reap; to work and plant for those who are to occup y the earth when we are dead; to project our influences far into the future, and live beyond our time ; to rule as the Kings of Thought, over men who are yet unborn; to bless with the glorious gifts of Truth and Light and Libert y those who will neither know the name of the giver, nor care in what grave his unregarded ashes repose, is the true office of a Mason and the proudest destiny of a man. All the great and beneficent operations of Nature are produced b y slow and often imperceptible degrees. The work of destruction and devastation only is violent and rapid. The Volcano and the Earthquake, the Tornado and the Avalanche, leap suddenl y into full life and fearful energy, and smite with an unexpected blow. Ve suvius buried Pompei i and Herculaneu m in a night; and Lisbon fell prostrate before God in a breath, when the earth rocked and shuddered; the Alpine village vanishes and is erased at one bound of the avalanche ; and the ancient forests fall like grass before the mower, when the tornado leaps upon the m.

But many years ago, before the Norman Conqueror stamped his mai led foot on the neck of prostrate Saxon England, some wandering barbarian, of the continent then unknown to the world, in mere idleness, with hand or foot, covered an acorn with a little earth, and pas sed on regardless, on his journey to the dim Past. He died and was forgotten; but the acorn la y there still, the mighty force within it acting in the darkness. A tender shoot stole gentl y up; and fed by the light and air and frequent dews, put forth its little leaves, and lived, because the elk or buffalo chanced not to place his foot upon and crush it. The years marched onward, and the shoot beca me a sapling, and its green leaves went and came with Spring and Autumn. And still the years came and passed awa y again, and Will iam, the Norman Bastard, parcelled England out among his Barons, and still the sapling grew, and the dews fed its leaves, and the birds builded their nests among its small limbs for man y generations. And still the years came and went, and the Indian hunter slept in the shade of the sapling, and Richard Lion-Heart fought at Acre and Ascalon, and John 's bold Barons wrested from him the Great Charter; and to! the sapling had becom e a tree; and still it grew, and thrust its great arms wider abroad, and lifted its head still higher toward the Heavens; strong-rooted, and defiant of the storms that roared and eddied through its branches; and when Columbus ploughed with his keels the unknown Western Atlantic, and Cortez and Pizarro bathed the cross in blood; and the Puritan, the Huguenot, the Cavalier, and the follower of Penn sought a refuge and a resting-place beyond the ocean, the Great Oak still stood, firm- rooted, vigorous, statel y, haughtil y domineering over all the forest, heedless of all the centuries that had hurried past since the wild Indian planted the littl e acorn in the forest; – a stout and hale old tree, with wide circumf erence shading man y a rood of ground; and fit to furnish timbers for a ship, to carry the thunders of the Great Republic's guns around the world. And ye t, if one had sat and watched it every instant, from the moment when the feeble shoot first pushed its way to the light until the eagles built among its branches, he would never have seen the tree or sapling grow .

They lived and died, incalcu lable in numbers and almost infinite in the succession of their generations, each adding his mite to the gigantic work that went on there under God' s direction. Thus hath He chosen to create great Continents and Islands; and still the coral- insects live and work, as when the y made the rocks that underlie the valley of the Ohio. Thus God hath chosen to create. Where now is firm land, once chafed and thundered the great primeval ocean. For ages upon ages the minute shields of infinite myriads of infusoria, and the stony stems of encrinites sunk into its depths, and there, under the vast pressure of its waters, hardened into limestone. Raised slowly from the Profound by His hand, its quarries underlie the soil of all the continents, hundreds of feet in thickness; and Page 231 of 621"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike we, of these remains of the countless dead, build tombs and palaces, as the Egyptians, whom we call ancient, built their pyramids. On all the broad lakes and oceans the Great Sun looks earnestl y and lovingl y, and the invisible vapors rise ever up to meet him. No eye but God 's beholds them as they rise. There, in the upper at mosphere, they are condensed to mist, and gather into clouds, and float and swim around in the ambien t air. They sail with its currents, and hover over the ocean, and roll in huge masses round the stony shoulders of great mountains. Condensed still more by change of temper ature, they drop upon the thirsty earth in gentle showers, or pour upon it in heav y rains, or storm against its bosom at the angry Equinoctia l. The shower, the rain, and the storm pass away , the clouds vanish, and the bright stars again shine clearly upon the glad earth. The rain-drops sink into the ground, and gather in subterranean reservoirs, and run in subterranean channels, and bubble up in springs and fountains; and from the moun tain-sides and heads of valle ys the silver threads of water begin their long jo urney to the ocean. Uniting, they widen into brooks and rivulets, then into streams and rivers; and, at last, a Nile, a Ganges, a Danube, an Amazon, or a Mississippi rolls between its banks, migh ty, majesti c, and resistless, creating vast alluvial valleys to be the granaries of the world, ploughed b y the thousand keels of comm erce and serving as great highwa ys, and as the impassabl e boundaries of rival nations; ever returning to the ocean the drops that rose from it in vapor, and descended in rain and snow and hail upon the level plains and loft y mountains; and causing him to recoil for man y a mile before the head-long rush of their great tide. So it is with the aggregate of Human endeavor. As the invisible particles of vapor combine and coalesce to form the mists and clouds that fall in rain on thirsty continents, and bless the great green forests and wide grassy prairies, the waving meadows and the fields b y which men live; as the infinite myriads of drops that the glad earth drinks are gathered into springs and rivulets and rivers, to aid in levelling the mount ains and elevat ing the plains, and to feed the large lakes and restless oceans; so all Human Thought, and Speech and Action, all that is done and said and thought and suffered upon the Earth combine together, and flow on ward in one broad resistless current toward those great results to which the y are determ ined by the will of God. We build slowl y and destroy swiftly. Our Ancient Brethren who built the Temples at Jerusalem , with man y myriad blows felled, hewed, and squared the cedars, and quarried the stones, and carved the intrica te ornaments, which were to be the Temples. Stone after stone, by the comb ined effort and long toil of Apprentice, Fellow-Craft, and Master, the walls arose; slowly the roof wa s framed and fashioned; and man y years elapsed before, at length, the Houses stood finished, all fit and read y for the Worship of God, gorgeous in the sunny splendors of the at mosphere of Palestine. So they were built. A single mo tion of the arm of a rude, barbarous Assyrian Spearman, or drunken Roman or Gothic Legionar y of Titus, moved by a senseless impulse of the brutal will, flung in the blazing brand; and, with no further human agency, a few short hours sufficed to consume and melt each Temple to a smoking mass of black unsightl y ruin.

The Apocaly pse, that sublim e Kabalistic and prophetic Summary of all the occult figures, divides its images into three Septenaries, after each of which there is silence in Heaven. There are Seven Seals to be opened, that is to sa y, Seven mysteries to know, and Seven difficult ies to overco me, Seven trumpe ts to sound, and Seven cups to e mpty. The Apocaly pse is, to those who receive the nineteen th Degree, the Apotheosis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to God alone, and despises all the pomps and work s of Lucifer. LUCIFER, the Light- bearer ! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light , and with its splendors intolerab le blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls ? Doubt it not! for traditions are full of Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and Inspiration is not of one Age nor of one Creed. Plato and Philo, also, were inspired. The Apocaly pse, indeed, is a book as obscure as the Sohar. It is written hierogly phically with numbers and images; and the Apostle often appeals to the intellig ence of the Initiated. \"Let him who hath knowledge, understand! let him who understands, calcul ate!\" he often says, after an allegor y or the mention of a numb er. Saint John, the favorite Apostle, and the Depositary of all the Secrets of the Saviour, therefore did not write to be understood b y the multitude. The Sephar Yezirah, the Sohar, and the Apocal ypse are the comple test embodim ents of Occultis m. They contain more meanings than words; their expressions are figurative as poetry and exact as numbers. The Apocaly pse sums up, compl etes, and surpasses all the Science of Abraham and of Solomon. The visions of Ezekiel, by the river Chebar, and of the new Sy mbolic Temple, are equally mysterious expressions, veiled by figures of the enigmatic dogmas of the Kabalah, and their symbols are as little understood by the Commentators, as those of Free Masonry . The Septenar y is the Crown of the Numbers, because it unites the Triangle of the Idea to the Square of the Form. The more the great Hierophants were at pains to conceal their absolute Science, the mor e they sought to add grandeur to and multiply its symbols. The huge p yramids, with their triangular sides of elevation and square bases, represented their Metaphy sics, founded upon the knowledge of Nature. That knowledge of Nature had for its s ymbolic key the gigantic form of that huge Sphinx, which has hollowed its deep bed in the sand, while keeping watch at the feet of the P yramids. The Seven grand monum ents called the Wonders of the World, were the magn ificent Commentaries on the Seven lines that composed the Pyramids, and on the Seven m ystic gates of Thebes. Page 233 of 621"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Septenar y philosophy of Initiation among the Ancients may be sum med up thus: Three Absolute Principles which are but One Principle: four elem entary forms which are but one; all forming a Single Whole, compounded of the Idea and the Form. The three Principles were these: 1°. BEING IS BEIN G. In Philosoph y, identity of the Idea and of Being or Verity ; in Religion, the first Principle, THE FATHER. 2°. BEIN G IS REAL. In Philosoph y, identity of Kno wing and of Being or Realit y; in Religion, the Logos of Plato, the Demiourgos , the WORD. 3°. BEING IS LO GIC. In Philosoph y, identity of the Reason and Realit y; in Religion, Providence, the Divine Action that makes real the Good, that which in Christianit y we call THE H OLY SPIRIT. The union of all the Seven colors is the White , the analogous symbol of the GOOD: the absence of all is the Black , the analogous s ymbol of the EVIL. There are three primar y colors, Red , Yellow , and Blue ; and four secondary , Orange , Green , Indigo , and Violet ; and all these God displa ys to man in the rainbow; and the y have their analogies also in the moral and intel lectual world. The same number, Seven , continual ly reappears in the Apocal ypse, compounded of three and four ; and these numbers relate to the last Seven of the Sephiroth, three answering to BENIG NITY or MERCY, SEVERITY or J USTICE, and BEAUTY or H ARMO NY; and four to Netzach , H ō d , Y e s ō d , and Malakoth , VICTORY, GLORY, ST ABILITY, and DOMINATION. The same numbers also represent the first three Sephiroth, KETHER, KH OKMAH, and BAI NAH, or Will , Wisdom , and Understanding , which, with D AATH or Intellect ion or Thought , are also four, DA ATH not being regarded as a Sephirah, not as the Deit y acting, or as a potenc y, energy , or attribu te, but as the Divine Action. The Sephiroth are com monly figured in the Kabalah as constitut ing a human form, the ADAM KADMON or M ACROCO SM. Thus arranged, the universal law of Equipoise is three times exemp lified. From that of the Divine Intelle ctual, Active, Masculine ENERG Y, and the Pas sive CAPACITY to produce Thought, the action of THINKI NG results. From that of BENIGNITY and SEVERITY, H ARMO NY flows; and from that of VICTORY or an Infinite overcoming, and GLORY, w hich, being Infinite, would seem to forbid the existence of obstacles or opposition, results STABILITY or PERMA NENCE, which is the perfect DOMINIO N of the Infinite WILL. The last nine Sephiroth are included in, at the same time that they have flowed forth from, the first of all, KETHER, or the CROWN. Each also, in succession flowed from, and yet still remains included in, the one preceding it. The Will of God includes His Wisdom, and His Wisdom is His Will speciall y developed and acting. This Wisdom is the Logos that Page 234 of 621"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike creates, mistaken and personified by Simon Magus and the succ eeding Gnostics. By means of its utterance, the letter Y D, it creates the worlds, first in the Divine Intellect as an Idea, Ō which invested with form became the fabricated World, the Universe of material reality. Y D and HE, two letters of the Ineffable Na Ō me of the Manifested Deity, represent the Male and the Female, the Active and the Passive in Equilibriu m, and the VA V comp letes the Trinity and the Triliter al Name יהו , the Divine Triangle, which with the repetition of the He becomes the Tetragram maton. Thus the ten Sephiroth contain all the Sacred Numbers, three , five , seven , and nine , and the perfect Number Ten , and correspond with the Tetract ys of Pythagoras. BEING Is BEIN G, אשר אהיה אהיה , Ahayah Asar Ahayah . This is the Principle, the \"BEGINNI NG.\" In the Beginning was, that is to say, IS, WAS, and WILL BE, the WORD, that is to say , the REASON that Speaks . Εν αρχ ῃ ην Ὁ Λογος! The Word is the reason of belief, and in it also is the expression of the Faith which makes. Science a living thing. The Word,. Λογος, is the Source of Logic. Jesus is the Word Incarnate. The accord of the Reason with Faith, of Knowledge with Belief, of Authorit y, with Liberty, has become in modern times the veritabl e enigma of the Sphinx. It is WIS DOM that, in the Kabalistic Books of the Proverbs and Ecclesiast icus, is the Creative Agent of God. Elsewhere in the Hebrew writings it is דבר יהוה , Deba r Iahavah , the Word of God. It is by His uttered Word that God reveals Himself to us; not alone in the visible and invisible but intelle ctual creation, but also in our convictions, consciousness, and instincts. Hence it is that certain beliefs are universal. The conviction of all men that God is good led to a belief in a Devil, the fallen Lucifer or Light-bearer , Shaitan the Adversary, Ahriman and Tuph n, as an attempt to explain the existence of Evil, and make ō it consistent with the Infinite Power, Wisdom, and Benevolence of God. Nothing surpasses and nothing equals, as a Sum mary of all the doctrines of the Old World, those brief word s engraven by HERMES on a Stone, and kno wn under the nam e of \" The Tablet of Emerald :\" the Unity of Being and the Unit y of the Harmoni es, ascending and descending, the progres sive and proportional scale of the Word; the immutable law of the Equilibriu m, and the proportioned progress of the universal analogies; the relation of the Idea to the Word, giving the me asure of the relation between the Creator and the Created, the necessary mathematics of the Infinite, proved by the me asures of a single corner of the Finite; – all this is expressed by this single proposition of the Great Egyptian Hierophant: \" What is Superior is a s that which is Inferior, and what is Below is as that which is Above, to form the Marvels of the Unity .\" Page 235 of 621"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike XX — GRAND MASTER OF ALL S YMBOLIC L ODGES XX — GRAND MASTER OF ALL S YMBOLIC L ODGES THE true Mason is a practica l Philosopher, who, under religious emblems, in all ages adopted by wisdom, builds upon plans traced by nature and reason the moral edifice of knowledge. He ought to find, in the symmetrical relation of all the parts of this rational edifice, the principle and rule of all his duties, the source of all his pleasures. He improv es his mora l nature, becom es a better man, and finds in the reunion of virtuous men, assembl ed with pure views, the means of multip lying his acts of beneficence. Masonry and Philosoph y, without being one and the same thing, have the same object, and propose to themselves the same end, the worship of the Grand Architect of the Universe, acquaintance and familiarity with the wonders of nature, and the happiness of human ity attained by the constant practice of all the virtues. As Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges, it is your especial duty to aid in restoring Masonry to its primitive purity. You have beco me an instructor. Masonry long wandered in error. Instead of improv ing, it degenerated from its primi tive simplicity, and retrograded toward a system, distorted by stupidit y and ignorance, which, unable to construct a beautiful machin e, made a comp licated one. Less than two hundred years ago, its organizat ion was simple, and altogether moral, its emblems, allegories, and ceremon ies easy to be understood, and their purpose and object readily to be seen. It was then confined to a very small number of Degrees. Its constitutions were like those of a Society of Essenes, written in the first centur y of our era. There could be seen the primitive Christianit y, organized into Masonry, the school of P ythagoras without incongruities or absurdities; a Masonry simple and significant, in which it was not necessar y to torture the mind to discover reasonable interpretat ions; a Masonr y at once religious and philosophical, worthy of a good citizen and an enlightened philanthropist. Innovators and inventors overturned that primitive simplicity. Ignorance engaged in the work of making Degrees, and trifles and gewgaws and pretended mysteries, absurd or hideous, usurped the place of Masonic Truth. The picture of a horrid vengeance, the poniard and the bloody head, appeared in the peaceful Temple of Masonry , without sufficient explanat ion of their symbolic meaning: Oaths out of all proportion with their object, shocked the candidate, and then became ridiculous, and were wholl y disregarded. Acolytes were exposed to tests, and compe lled to perform acts, which, if real, would have been abominab le; but being mere chimer as, were preposterous, and excited contemp t and laughter only. Eight hundred Degrees of one kind and another were invented: Infideli ty and even Jesuitry were taught under the mask of Masonr y. The rituals even of the respectable Degrees, copied and mut ilated by ignorant men, became nonsensical and trivial; and the words so corrupted that it has hitherto been found impossibl e to recover many of them at all. Candidates were made to degrade the mselves, and to submit to insults not tolerable to a man of spirit and honor. Hence it was that, practical ly, the largest portion of the Degrees claim ed by the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and before it by the Rite of Perfection, fell into disuse, were Page 236 of 621"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike merely communicated, and their rituals became jejune and insignificant. These Rites resembled those old palaces and baronial castles, the different parts of which, built at different periods remote from one another, upon plans and according to tastes that greatly varied, formed a discordant and incongruous whole. Judaism and chivalr y, superstition and philosoph y, philanthrop y and insane hatred and longing for vengeance, a pure mora lity and unjust and illegal revenge, were found strangely mated and standing hand in hand within the Temples of Peace and Concord; and the whole system was one grotesque com mingling of incongruous things, of contrasts and contradictions, of shocking and fantastic extravaganc es, of parts repugnant to good taste, and fine conceptions overlaid and disfigured by absurdities engendered by ignorance, fanaticis m, and a senseless m ysticism. An empt y and sterile pomp, impossible indeed to be carried out, and to which no me aning whatever was attached, with far-fetched explanations that were either so many stupid platitud es or themselv es needed an interpreter; lofty titles, arbitraril y assumed, and to which the inventors had not condescended to attach any explanation that should acquit them of the folly of assuming tempora l rank, power, and titles of nobilit y, made the world laugh, and the Initiate feel asham ed. Some of these titles we retain; but the y have with us meanings entirely consistent with that Spirit of Equalit y which is the foundation and peremptor y law of its being of all Masonry. The Knight , with us, is he who devotes his hand, his heart, his brain, to the Science of Masonry , and professes himself the Sworn S oldier of Truth: the Prince is he who aims to be Chief , [ Princeps ], first , leader , among his equals, in virtue and good deeds: the Sovereign is he who, one of an order who se members are all Sovereigns, is Supreme only because the law and constitutions are so, which he admin isters, and by which he, like every other brother, is governed. The titles, Puissant , Potent , Wise , and Venerable , indicate that power of Virtue, Intelligenc e, and Wisdom, which those ought to strive to attain who are placed in high office by the suffrages of their brethren: and all our other titles and designations have an esoteric meaning, consistent with modest y and equalit y, and which those who receive them should full y understand. As Master of a Lodge it is your duty to instruct your Brethren that they are all so man y constant lessons, teaching the lofty qualific ations which are required of those who claim them, and not mere ly idle gewgaw s worn in ridiculous imitation of the times when the Nobles and Priests were masters and the people slaves: and that, in all true Masonry, the Knight, the Pontiff, the Prince, and the Sovereign are but the first among their equals: and the cordon, the clothing, and the jewel but symbols and embl ems of the virtues required of all good Mason s. The Mason kneels, no longer to present his petition for admi ttance or to receive the answer, no longer to a man as his s uperior, who is but his brother, but to his God; to whom he appeals for the rectitude of his intentions, and who se aid he asks to enable him to keep his vows. N o one is degraded b y bending his knee to God at the altar, or to receive the honor of Knighthood as Bay ard and Du Guesclin knelt. To kneel for other purposes, Masonry does not require. God gave to m an a head to be borne erect, a port upright and majestic. We assemble in our Templ es to cherish and inculcate sentim ents that conform to that loftiness of bearing which the just and upright man is entitl ed to maintain, and we do not require those who desire to be ad mitted among us, ignominiousl y to bow the head. We respect man, because we respect ourselves that he may conceive a lofty idea of his dignit y Page 237 of 621"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike as a hum an being free and independent. If modest y is a virtue, humility and obsequiousness to man are base: for there is a noble pride which is the most real and solid basis of virtue. Man should humble himself before the Infinite God; but not before his erring and imp erfect brother. As Master of a Lodge, you will therefore be exceedingl y careful that no Candidate, in any Degree, be. required to submit to any degradation whatever; as has been too much the custom in some of the Degrees: and take it as a certain and inflexible rule, to which there is no exception, that real Masonr y requires of no man anything to which a Knight and Gentleman cannot honorably , and without feeling outraged or humi liated submit. The Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States at length undertook the indispensable and long-dela yed task of revising and reform ing the work and rituals of the thirty Degrees under its jurisdiction. Retaining the essentials of the Degrees and all the means by which the me mbers recognize one another, it has sought out and developed the leading idea of each Degree, rejected the puerilit ies and absurdities with which many of them were disfigured, and made of them a connected system of moral, religious, and philosophical instruction. Sectarian of no creed, it has yet thought it not improper to use the old allegori es, based on occurrences detailed in the Hebrew and Christian books, and drawn from the Ancient Mysteries of Egy pt, Persia, Greece, India, the Druids and the Essenes, as vehicles to com municate the Great Masonic Truths; as it has used the legends of the Crusades, and the ceremoni es of the orders of Knighthood. It no longer inculcat es a criminal and wicked vengeance. It has not allowed Masonry to play the assassin: to avenge the death either of Hiram, of Charles the 1st, or of Jaque s De Molay and the Te mplars. The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonry has now become, what Masonry at first was meant to be, a Teacher of Great Truths, inspired b y an upright and enlightened reason, a fir m and constant wisdom, and an affectionate and liberal philanthrop y. It is no longer a s ystem, over the composition and arrange ment of the different parts of which, want of reflection, chance, ignorance, and perhaps mot ives still more ignoble presided; a system unsuited to our habits, our manners, our ideas, or the world-wide philanthrop y and universal toleration of Masonr y; or to bodies small in number, whose revenues should be devoted to the relief of the unfortunate, and not to empty show; no longer a heterogeneous aggregate of Degrees, shocking by its anachronis ms and contradic tions, powerless to dissemin ate light, informat ion, and mor al and philosophical ideas. As Master, you will teach those w ho are under y ou, and to whom you will owe y our office, that the decorations of man y of the Degrees are to be dispensed with, whenever the expense would interfere with the duties of charit y, relief, and benevolence ; and to be indulged in only by wealth y bodies that will thereby do no wrong to those entitled to their assistance. The essentials of all the Degrees ma y be procured at slight expense; and it is at the option of every Brother to procure or not to procure, as he pleases, the dress, decorations, and jewels of an y Degree other than the 14th, 18th, 30th, and 32d.

They are to us but parables and allegori es, involving and enveloping Masonic instruction; and vehicles of useful and interesting informa tion. They represent the different phases of the human mind, its efforts and struggles to compreh end nature, God, the governm ent of the Universe, the permitted existence of sorrow and evil. To teach us wisdom, and the folly of endeavoring to explain to ourselves that which we are not capable of understanding, we reproduce the speculations of the Philosophers, the Kabalists, the Mystagogues and the Gnostics.

Where domesti c slavery exists, it teaches the mast er humani ty and the allevia tion of the condition of his slave, and moder ate correction and gentle discipline; as it teaches them to the master of the apprentice : and as it teaches to the employers of other m en, in mines, manufactories, and workshop s, consideration and humani ty for those who depend upon their labor for their bread, and to whom want of emplo yment is starvation, and overwork is fever, consumption, and death. As Master of a Lodge, you are to inculca te these duties on your brethren. Teach the employed to be honest, punctual, and faithful as well as respectful and obedient to all proper orders: but also teach the employer that every man or woman who desires to work, has a right to have work to do; and that the y, and those who from sicknes s or feebleness, loss of limb or of bodil y vigor, old age or infanc y, are not able to work, have a right to be fed, clothed, and sheltered from the inclem ent elements: that he com mits an awful sin against Masonry and in the sight of God, if he closes his workshops or factories, or ceases to work his min es, when they do not yield him what he regards as sufficient profit, and so dismisses his workmen and workwomen to starve; or when he reduces the wages of man or woman to so low a standard that they and their families cannot be clothed and fed and comfortably housed; or by overwork must give him their blood and life in exchange for the pittance of their wages: and that his dut y as a Ma son and Brother pere mptorily requires him to continue to employ those who else will be pinched with hunger and cold, or resort to theft and vice: and to pay them fair wages, though it may reduce or annul his profits or even eat into his capita l; for God hath but loaned him his wealth, and made him His almoner and agent to invest it.

They also, however, serve to remind the Mason who ha s advanced further, that his new rank is based upon the humble labors of the symbolic Degrees, as the y are improper ly termed, inasmuch as all the Degrees are symbolic. Thus the Initiates are inspired with a just idea of Masonry , to-wit, that it is essentiall y WORK; both teaching and practising LABOR; and that it is altogether emblematic. Three kinds of work are necessar y to the preservation and protection of man and societ y: manual labor, speciall y belonging to the three blue Degrees; labor in arms, symbolized by the Knightl y or chivalric Degrees; and intell ectual labor, belonging particularl y to the Philosophical Degrees. We have preserved and mult iplied such emb lems as have a true and profound meaning. We reject many of the old and senseless explanations. We have not reduced Masonry to a cold metaphysics that exiles everything belonging to the doma in of the imagin ation. The ignorant, and those half -wise in reality, but over- wise in their own conceit, may assail our symbols with sarcasms; but the y are neverthel ess ingenious veils that cover the Truth, respected by all who know the means by which the heart of man is reached and his feelings enlisted.

The Duties of the Class of Instructors , that is, the Masons of the Degrees from the 4th to the 8th, inclusive, are, particularl y, to perfect the younger Mason s in the words, sign s and tokens and other work of the Degrees they have received; to explain to them the meaning of the different emblems, and to expound the moral instruction which they convey .

In the Symbolic Lodges, they are particularl y charged to stimulate the zeal of the workmen, to induce them to engage in new labors and enterprises for the good of Masonry , their country and mank ind, and to give the m fraternal advice when they fall short of their duty; or, in cases that require it, to invoke against them the rigor of Masonic law. The Architec ts , or those of the 12th, 13th, and 14th, should be selected from none but Brothers well instructed in the preceding Degrees; zealous, and capable of discoursing upon that Masonry ; illustrat ing it, and discussing the simp le questions of moral philosoph y.

Slander and calu mny were never so insolentl y licentious in any country as they are this day in ours. The most retiring disposition, the most unobtrusive demeanor, is no shield against their poisoned arrows. The most eminent public service only makes their vituperation and invectiv e more eager and more unscrupulous, when he who has done such service presents himself as a candidat e for the people's s uffrages. The evil is wide-spread and universal. No man, no woman, no hou sehold, is sacred or safe from this new Inquisition. No act is so pure or so praiseworthy , that the unscrupulous vender of lies who lives by pandering to a corrupt and morbid public appetit e will not proclaim it as a crime. No motive is so innocent or so laudable, that he will not hold it up as villain y. Journalis m pries into the interior of private houses, gloats over the details of domestic tragedies of sin and s hame, and deliberatel y invents and industriously circula tes the most unmitigated and baseless falsehoods, to coin money for those who pursue it as a trade, or to effect a temporar y result in the wars of faction. We need not enlarge upon these evils. They are apparent to all and lamented over by all, and it is the duty of a Mason to do all in his power to lessen, if not to remove them. With the errors and even sins of other men, that do not personally affect us or ours, and need not our conde mnation to be odious, we have nothing to do; and the journalist has no patent that makes him the Censor of Morals. There is no obligation resting on us to trumpe t forth our disapproval of ever y wrongful or injudicious or improper act that every other man commits. One would be ashamed to stand on the street corners and retail them orally for pennies. One ought, in truth, to write or speak against no other one in this world.

Such is the revolting work in which journalism and politica l partisanship, and half the world outside of Masonry , are engaged. Very generall y, the censure bestowed upon men's acts, by those who have appointed and commissioned themselves Keepers of the Public Morals, is undeserved. Often it is not onl y undeserved, but praise is deserved instead of censure, and, when the latter is not undeserved, it is alwa ys extravagant, and therefore unjust. A Mason will wonder what spirit they are endowed withal, that can basely libel at a man, even, that is fallen. If they had any nobility of soul, the y would with him condole his disasters, and drop some tears in pity of his foll y and wretchedness: and if they were merely human and not brutal, Nature did grievous wrong to human bodies, to curse them with souls so cruel as to strive to add to a wretchedness already intolerab le. When a Mason hears of an y man that hath fallen into public disgrace, he should have a mind to commiserate his mishap, and not to make him more disconsolate. To enveno m a name by libels, that already is openl y tainted, is to add stripes with an iron rod to one that is flayed with whipping; and to every well-tempered mind will seem most in-human and unmanl y. Even the man who does w rong and commits errors often has a quiet home, a fireside of his own, a gentle, loving wife and innocent children, who perhaps do not know of his past errors and lapses – past and long repented of; or if the y do, they love him the better, because, being mortal, he hath erred, and being in the image of God, he hath repented. That every blow at this husband and father lacerates the pure and tender bosoms of that wife and those daughters, is a consideration that doth not sta y the hand of the brutal journalist and partisan: but he strikes home at these shrinking, quivering, innocent, tender bosoms; and then goes out upon the great arteries of cities, where the current of life pulsates, and holds his head erect, and calls on his fellows to laud him and admir e him, for the chivalri c act he hath done, in striking his dagger through one heart into another tender and trusting one. If you seek for high and strained carriages, you shall, for the most part, meet with the m in low men. Arrogance is a weed that ever grow s on a dunghill. It is from the rankness of that soil that she hath her height and spreadings. To be modest and unaffected with our superiors is dut y; with our equals, courtesy ; with our inferiors, nobleness. There is no arrogance so great as the proclai ming of other men's errors and faults, b y those who understand nothing but the dregs of actions, and who make it their business to besme ar deserving fames. Public reproof is like striking a deer in the herd: it not onl y wounds him, to the loss of blood, but betrays him to the hound, his enem y. The occupation of the spy hath ever been held' dishonorable, and it is none the less so, now that with rare exceptions editors and partisans have becom e perpetual spies upon the actions of other men. Their malice makes them nimble-eyed, apt to note a fault and publish it, and, with a strained construction, to deprave even those things in which the doer's intents were honest. Like the crocodile, they slime the way of others, to make them fall; and when that has happened, they feed their insulting envy on the life-blood of the prostrate. They set the vices of other men on high, for the gaze of the world, and place their virtues under-ground, that none ma y note the m. If they cannot wound upon proofs, the y will do it upon likelihoods: and if not upon the m, they manufac ture lies, as God created the Page 244 of 621"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike world, out of nothing; and so corrupt the fair tempter of men's reputations; knowing that the multitude will believe them, because affir mations are apter to win belief, than negatives to uncredit them; and that a lie travels faster than an eagle flies, while the contradic tion limps after it at a snail's pace, and, halting, never overtakes it. Nay, it is contrar y to the morality of journalis m, to allow a lie to be contradicted in the place that spawned it. And even if that great favor is conceded, a slander once raised will scarce ever die, or fail of finding many that will allow it both a harbor and trust. This is, beyond any other, the age of falsehood. Once, to be suspected of equivocat ion was enough to soil a gentle man's escutcheon; but now it has beco me a strange mer it in a partisan or statesm an, always and scrupulously to tell the truth. Lies are part of the regular ammunition of all campaigns and controversies, valued according as they are profitable and effective; and are stored up and have a; market price, like saltpetre and sulphur; being even more deadly than they. If men weighed the imperf ections of humanit y, they would breathe less condemnat ion. Ignorance gives disparage ment a louder tongue than knowledge does. Wise men had rather know, than tell. Frequent dispraises are but the faults of uncharitable wit: and it is from where there is no judgment, that the heaviest judgment comes; for self-exa mination would make all judgments charitable. If we even do know vices in men, we can scarce show ourselves in a nobler virtue than in the charity of concealing them: if that be not a flatter y persuading to continuance. And it is the basest office man can fall into, to make his tongue the defamer of the worthy man.. There is but one rule for the Mason in this ma tter. If there be virtues, and he is called upon to speak of him who own s them, let him tell them forth impartially. And if there be vices mixed with them, let him be content the world shall know them by some other tongue than his. For if the evil-doer deserve no pity , his wife, his parents, or his children, or other innocent persons who love him may; and the bravo's trade, practised by him who stabs the defenceless for a price paid by individual or part y, is reall y no more respectable now than it was a hundred y ears ago, in Venice. Where we want experienc e, Charity bids us think the best, and leave what we kno w not to the Searcher of Hearts; for mistakes, suspicions, and envy often injure a clear fame; and there is least danger in a charitable construction. And, finall y, the Mason should be humble and modest toward the Grand Architect of the Universe, and not impugn His Wisdom, nor set up his own imperf ect sense of Right against His Providence and dispensations, nor atte mpt too rashly to explore the Mysteries of God' s Infinite Essence and inscrutable plans, and of that Great Nature which we are not made capable to understand. Let him steer far away from all those vain philosophies, which endeavor to account for all that is, without admitting that there is a God, separate and apart from the Universe which is his work: which erect Universal Nature into a God, and worship it alone: which annihila te Spirit, and believe no testimon y except that of the bodily senses: which, b y logical formulas and dextrous colloca tion of words, make the actual, living, guiding, and protecting God fade into the dim mistiness of a mere abstraction and unrealit y, itself a mere logical formula.

SYMPATH Y with the great laboring classes, respect for labor itself, and resolution to do some good work in our da y and generation, these are the lessons of this Degree, and the y are purely Masonic. Masonry has made a working-man and his associates the Heroes of her principal legend, and himse lf the companion of King s. The idea is as simple and true as it is sublime. From first to last, Masonry is work . It venerates the Grand Architect of the Universe. It commemorates the building of a Temple. Its principal emblems are the working tools of Masons and Artisans. It preserves the nam e of the first worker in bras s and iron as one of its pass-word s. When the Brethren meet together, they are at labor . The Master is the overseer who sets the craft to work and gives them proper instruction. Masonry is the apotheosis of WORK. It is the hands of brave, forgotten men that have made this great, populous, cultivated world a world for us . It is all work, and forgotten work. The real conquerors, creators, and eternal proprietors of ever y great and civilized land are all the heroic souls that ever were in it, each in his degree: all the men that ever felled a forest- tree or drained a marsh, or contrived a wise scheme, or did or said a true or valiant thing therein. Genuine work alone, done faithfull y, is eternal, even as the Almight y Founder and World-builder Himself. All work is noble: a life of ease is not for any man, nor for any God. The Almigh ty Maker is not like one who, in old immemorial ages, having mad e his machine of a Universe, sits ever since, and sees it go . Out of that belief comes Atheism. The faith in an Invisible, Unnamab le, Directing Deity, present everywhere in all that we see, and work, and suffer, is the essence of all faith whatsoever. The life of all Gods figures itself to us as a Subli me Earnestness, – of Infinite battle against Infinite labor Our highest religion is named the Worship of Sorrow. F or the Son of Man there is no noble crown, well-worn, or even ill- worn, but is a crown of thorns. M an's highest destiny is not to be happ y, to love pleasant things and find them. His onl y true unhappiness should be that he cannot work, and get his destin y as a man fulfilled. The day passes s wiftly over, our life passes s wiftly over, and the night cometh, wherein no man can work. That night once come, our happiness and unhappiness are vanished, and become as things that never were. But our work is not abolished, and has not vanished. It remains, or the want of it remains, for endless Tim es and Eterniti es. Whatsoever of mora lity and intell igence; what of patienc e, perseverance, faithfulness, of method, insight, ingenuit y, energy; in a word, whatsoever of STREN GTH a man has in him, will lie written in the WORK he does. To work is to tr y himself against Nature and her unerring, everlasting laws: and the y will return true verdict as to him. The noblest Epic is a mighty Empire slowly built together, a migh ty series of heroic deeds, a mighty conquest over chaos. Deeds are greater than words. They have a life, mute, but undeniable; and grow. They people the vacuit y of Time, and make it green and worthy . Page 247 of 621"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Labor is the truest emblem of God, the Architect and Eternal Maker; noble Labor, which is yet to be the King of this Earth, and sit on the highest Throne. Men without duties to do, are like trees planted on precipic es; from the roots of which all the earth has crumbled. Nature owns no man who is not also a Mart yr. She scorns the man who sits screened from all work, from want, danger, hardship, the victory over which is work; and has all his work and battling done b y other men; and yet there are men who pride themse lves that they and theirs have done no work time out of mind. So neither have the swine. The chief of men is he who stands in the van of men, fronting the peril which frightens back all others, and if not vanquished would devour them. Hercules was worshipped for twelve labors. The Czar of Russia beca me a toiling shipwright, and worked with his axe in the docks of Saardam; and someth ing came of that. Cromwel l worked, and Napoleon; and effected somewha t. There is a perennial nobleness and even sacredness in work. Be he never so benighted and forgetful of his high calling, there is alway s hope in a man who actuall y and earnestl y works: in Idleness alone is there perpetual Despair. Man perfects hi mself by working. Jungles are cleared away. Fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities; and withal, the man himself first ceases to be a foul unwholesom e jungle and desert thereby. Even in the meanest sort of labor, the whole soul of man is composed into a kind of real harmon y, the moment he begins to work. Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, Remorse, Indignation, and even Despair shrink mur muring far off into their caves, whenever the man bends himse lf resolutel y against his task. Labor is life. From the inmost heart of the worker rises his G od- given Force, the Sacred Celestial Life-essence, breathed into him by Almight y God; and awakens hi m to all nobleness, as soon as work fitl y begins. By it man learns Patience, Courage, Perseverance, Openness to light, readiness to own himself mistak en, resolution to do better and improve. Only by labor will man continual ly learn the virtues. There is no Religion in stagnation and inaction ; but onl y in activit y and exertion. There was the deepest truth in that saying of the old monks, \" laborare est orare .\" \"He pra yeth best who loveth best all things both great and smal l;\" and can man love except by working earnestl y to benefit that being whom he loves? \"Work; and therein have well-being,\" is the oldest of Go spels; unpreached, inarticul ate, but ineradicab le, and enduring forever. To mak e Disorder, wherever found, an eternal enemy; to attack and subdue him, and make order of him, the subject not of Chaos, but of Intelligence and Divinit y, and of ourselves; to attack ignorance, stupidit y and brute- mindedness, wherever found, to smite it wisely and unweariedl y, to rest not while we live and it lives, in the name of God, this is our duty as Masons; com manded us by the Highest God. Even He, with his unspoken voice, more awful than the thunders of Sinai, or the syllabled speech of the Hurricane, speaks to us. The Unborn Ages; the old Graves, with their long-moldering dust speak to us. The deep Death- Kingdoms, the Stars in their never- resting course, all Space and all Time, silently and continual ly admon ish us that we too must work while it is called to-day. Labor, wide as the Earth, has its summ it in Heaven. To toil, whether with the sweat of the brow, or of the brain or heart, is worship, – the noblest thing yet discovered beneath the Stars. Let the wear y cease to think that labor is a curse and doom pronounced b y Deity, Without it there could be no true excellen ce in human nature. Without it, and pain, and sorro w, where would be the hum an virtues?

Even in the weak human memory they long survive, as Saints, as Heroes, and as Gods: the y alone survive, and people the unmeasured solitudes of Time. To the prim eval man, whatsoever good came, descended on hi m (as in mer e fact, it ever does) direct from God; whatsoever duty lay visible for him, this a Supreme God had prescribed. For the pri meval man, in whom dwelt Thought, this Universe was all a Temple, life everywhere a Worship. Duty is with us ever; and ever more forbids us to be idle. To work with the hands or brain, according to our requirem ents and our capaci ties, to do that which lies before us to do, is more honorable than rank and title. Ploughers, spinners and builders, inventors, and men of science, poets, advocates, and writers, all stand upon one co mmon level, and form one grand, innumerab le host, mar ching ever onward since the beginning of the world: each entitled to our s ympathy and respect, each a man and our brother. It was well to give the earth to man as a dark m ass, whereon to labor. It was well to provide rude and unsightl y materials in the ore-bed and the forest, for him to fashion into splendor and beaut y. It was w ell, not because of that splendor and beauty ; but because the act creating them is better than the things the mselves; because exertion is nobler than enjoyment; because the laborer is greater and more worthy of honor than the idler. Masonry stands up for the nobilit y of labor. It is Heaven' s great ordinance for human improvement. It has been broken down for ages; and Masonry desires to build it up again. It has been broken down, because men toil only because the y must, submit ting to it as, in some sort, a degrading necessity ; and desiring nothing so much on earth as to escape from it. They fulfill the great law of labor in the letter, but break it in the spirit,: they fulfill it with the muscl es, but break it with the mind. Masonry teaches that every idler ought to hasten to some field of labor, m anual or menta l, as a chosen and coveted theatre of improvem ent; but he is not i mpelled to do so, under the teachings of an imperfe ct civilization. On the contrar y, he sits down, folds his hands, and blesses and glorifies himself in his idleness. It is ti me that this opprobrium of toil were done away. To be asham ed of toil; of the dingy workshop and dusty labor-field; of the hard hand, stained with service mor e honorable than that of war; of the soiled and weather- stained garmen ts, on which Mother Nature has stamped, midst sun and rain, midst fire and steam, her own heraldic honors; to be ashamed of these tokens and titles, and envious of the flaunting robes of imbe cile idleness and vanit y, is treason to Nature, imp iety to Heaven, a breach of Heaven' s great Ordinance. TOIL, of brain, heart, or hand, is the only true man-hood and genuine nobility. Labor is a more beneficent ministration than man's ignorance comprehends, or his complainings will ad mit. Even when its end is hidden from him, it is not mer e blind drudger y. It is all a training, a discipline, a develop ment of energies, a nurse of virtues, a school of improvem ent. From the poor bo y who gathers a few sticks for his mother's Page 249 of 621"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike hearth, to the strong man who fells the oak or guides the ship or the steam- car, ever y human toiler, with ever y weary step and every urgent task, is obey ing a wisdom far above his own wisdom, and fulfilling a design far beyond his own de sign. The great law of human industry is this: that industr y, working either with the hand or the mind, the application of our po wers to some task, to the achievem ent of some result, lies at the foundation of all human improv ement. We are not sent into the world like animals, to crop the spontaneous herbage of the field, and then to lie down in indolent repose: but we are sent to dig the soil and plough the sea; to do the business of cities and the work of manufactories. The world is the great and appointed school of industry . In an artific ial state of societ y, mankind is divided into the idle and the laboring classes; but such was not the design of Providence. Labor is man's great function, his peculiar distinction and his privilege. From being an animal, that eats and drinks and sleeps only , to become a worker, and with the hand of ingenuit y to pour his own thoughts into the moulds of Nature, fashioning them into forms of grace and fabrics of convenience, and converting them to purposes of improve ment and happiness, is the greatest possible step in privilege. The Earth and the Atmosphere are man's laborator y. With spade and plough, with mining- shafts and furnaces and forges, with fire and stea m; midst the noise and whirl of swift and bright machinery, and abroad in the silent fields, man was made to be ever working, ever experimenting. And while he and all his dwellings of care and toil are borne onward with the circling skies, and the splendors of Heaven are around him, and their infinite depths image and invite his thought, still in all the worlds of philosoph y, in the universe of intellect, man must be a worker. He is nothing, he can be nothing, can achieve nothing, fulfill nothing, without working. Without it, he can gain neither lofty improve ment nor tolerabl e happiness. The idle must hunt down the hours as their prey. To them Time is an enemy, clothed with armor; and they must kill him, or themselves die. It never yet did answer, and it never will answer, for an y man to do nothing, to be exe mpt from all care and effort, to lounge, to walk, to ride, and to feast alone. No man can live in that way. God made a law against it: which no human power can annul, no human ingenuit y evade. The idea that a property is to be acquired in the course of ten or twenty years, which shall suffice for the rest of life; that by some prosperous traffic or grand speculation, all the labor of a whole life is to be accomp lished in a brief portion of it; that by dexterous management, a large part of the term of hum an existence is to be exonerated from the cares of industr y and self-denial, is founded upon a grave mist ake, upon a misconcep tion of the true nature and design of business, and of the conditions of human well-being. The desire of accu mulation for the sake of securing a life of ease and gratificat ion, of escaping from exertion and self-denial, is wholly wrong, though ver y common. It is better for the Mason to live while he lives, and enjoy life as it passes: to live richer and die poorer. It is best of all for him to banish from the mind that empty dream of future indolence and indulgence; to address himself to the business of life, as the school of his earthly education ; to settle it with himself now that independence, if he gains it, is not to give him exempt ion from employment. It is best for him to know, that, in order to be a happy man, he must always be a laborer, with the mind or the bod y, or with both: and that Page 250 of 621"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the reasonable exertion of his powers, bodily and mental, is not to be regarded as mere drudger y, but as a good discipline, a wise ordination, a training in this prim ary school of our being, for nobler endeavors, and spheres of higher activity hereafter. There are reasons why a Mason ma y lawfully and even earnestl y desire a fortune. If he can fill some fine palace, itself a work of art, with the productions of loft y genius; if he can be the friend and helper of humble worth; if he can seek it out, where failing health or adverse fortune presses it hard, and soften or stay the bitter hours that are hastening it to madness or to the grave; if he can stand between the oppres sor and his prey , and bid the fetter and the dungeon give up their victim; if he can build up great institutions of learning, and academies of art; if he can open fountains of knowledge for the people, and conduct its streams in the right channels; if he can do better for the poor than to bestow al ms upon them – even to think of them, and devise plans for their elevation in knowledge and virtue, instead of forever opening the old reservoirs and resources for their improviden ce; if he has sufficient heart and soul to do all this, or part of it; if wealth would be to hi m the handmaid of exertion, facilitating effort, and giving success to endeavor; then m ay he lawfull y, and yet warily and modestl y, desire it. But if it is to do nothing for him, but to m inister ease and indulgence, and to place his children in the same bad school, then there is no reason why he should desire it. What is there glorious in the world, that is not the product of labor, either of the body or of the mind? What is history , but its record? What are the treasures of genius and art, but its work? What are cultivated fields, but its toil? The busy marts, the rising cities, the enriched empires of the world are but the great treasure- houses of labor. The pyramids of Egypt, the castles and towers and te mples of Europe, the buried cities of Italy and Mexico, the canals and railroads of Christendo m, are but tracks, all round the world, of the mighty footsteps of labor. Without it antiquit y would not have been. Without it, there would be no mem ory of the past, and no hope for the future. Even utter indolence reposes on treasures that labor at some time gained and gathered. He that does nothing, and yet does not starve, has still his significance ; for he is a standing proof that somebody has at some time worked. But not to such does M asonry do honor. It honors the Worker, the Toiler; him who produces and not alone consumes; him who puts forth his hand to add to the treasur y of human comforts, and not alone to take away. It honors him who goes forth amid the struggling elements to fight his battle, and who shrinks not, with cowardly effeminacy, behind pillows of ease. It honors the strong muscle, and the man ly nerve, and the resolute and brave heart, the sweating brow, and the toiling brain. It honors the great and beautiful offices of humanit y, manhood's toil and woman's task; paternal industr y and mat ernal watching and weariness; wisdom teaching and patience learning; the brow of care that presides over the State, and many-handed labor that toils in workshop, field, and study, beneath its mild and beneficen t sway.

All industry would cease with the necessity for it; all improvement would stop with the demand for exertion; the dissipation of fortunes, the mischiefs of which are now countervailed by the healthful tone of societ y, would breed universal disease, and break out into universal license; and the world would sink, rotten as Herod, into the grave of its own loathsom e vices. Almost all the noblest things that have been achieved in the world, have been achieved by poor men ; poor scholars, poor professional men, poor artisans and artists, poor philosophers, poets, and men of genius. A certain staidness and sobriet y, a certain moderation and restraint, a certain pressure of circumst ances, are good for man. His bod y was not mad e for luxuries. It sickens, sinks, and dies under them. His mind was not made for indulgence. It grow s weak, effemina te, and dwarfish, under that condition. And he who pampers his body with luxuries and his mind with indulgence, bequeaths the consequences to the minds and bodies of his descendants, without the wealth which was their cause. For wealth, without a law of entail to help it, has alwa ys lacked the energ y even to keep its own treasures. They drop from its imbe cile hand. The third generation almost inevitabl y goes down the rolling wheel of fortune, and there learns the energy necessar y to rise again, if it rises at all; heir, as it is, to the bodil y diseases, and men tal weaknes ses, and the soul' s vices of its ancestors, and not heir to their wealth. And y et we are, al most all of us, anxious to put our children, or to insure that our grandchildren shall be put, on this road to indulgence, luxury, vice, degradation, and ruin; this heirship of hereditar y disease, soul malady, and mental leprosy . If wealth were emp loyed in promoting mental culture at home and work s of philanthrop y abroad; if it were mul tiplying studies of art, and building up institut ions of learning around us; if it were in every way raising the intell ectual character of the world, there could scarcely be too much of it. But if the utmost aim, effort, and ambi tion of wealth be, to procure rich furniture, and provide costl y entertainm ents, and build luxurious houses, and minister to vanit y, extravagance, and ostentation, there could scarcel y be too litt le of it. To a certain extent it may laudabl y be the m inister of elegancies and luxuries, and the servitor of hospitalit y and ph ysical enjoyment: but just in proportion as its tendencies, divested of all higher aims and tastes, are running that way, they are running to peril and evil. Nor does that peril attach to individua ls and fami lies alone. It stands, a fearful beacon, in the experience of Cities, Republics, and Empires. The lessons of pa st times, on this sub ject, are emphat ic and solemn. The history of wealth has alwa ys been a history of corruption and downfall. The people never existed that could stand the trial. Boundless profusion is too little likely to spread for an y people the theatre of man ly energy, rigid self- denial, and lofty virtue. You do not look for the bone and sinew and strength of a countr y, its loftiest talents and virtues, its martyrs to patriotism or religion, its men to meet the days of peril and disaster, among the children of ease, indulgence, and luxur y. In the great march of the races of men over the earth, we have alwa ys seen opulence and luxury sinking before povert y and toil and hardy nurture. That is the law which .has presided over the great processions of emp ire. Sidon and Ty re, whose merch ants possessed the wealth of princes; Babylon and Pal myra, the seats of Asiatic luxury; Rome, laden with the spoils of a world, overwhelm ed by her own vices more than by the hosts of her Page 252 of 621"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike enemies; all these, and man y more, are examp les of the destructive tendencies of immense and unnatural accumu lation: and men must become more generous and benevolent, not more selfish and effe minate, as they become more rich, or the history of modern wealth will follow in the sad train of all past exa mples. All men desire distinction, and feel the need of some ennobling object in life. Those persons are usuall y most happy and satisfied in their pursuits, who have the loftiest ends in view. Artists, mechani cians, and inventors, all who seek to find principles or develop beauty in their work, seem most to enjoy it. The farmer who labors for the beautif ying and scientifi c cultivat ion of his estate, is more happy in his labors than one who tills his own land for a mere subsistence. This is one of the signal testi monies which all human employments give to the high demands of our nature. To gather wealth never gives such satisfaction as to bring the humblest piece of mach inery to perfection: at least, when wealth is sought for displa y and ostentation, or mere luxury, and ease, and pleasure; and not for ends of philanthrop y, the relief of kindred, or the pa yment of just debts, or as a me ans to attain some other great and noble object. With the pursuits of mult itudes is connected a painful conviction that they neither supply a sufficient object, nor confer an y satisfactor y honor. Wh y work, if the world is soon not to know that such a being ever existed; and when one can perpetuate his name neither on canvas nor on marble, nor in books, nor by lofty eloquence, nor statesmanship? The answer is, that every man has a work to do in himse lf, greater and subli mer than any work of genius; and works upon a nobler material than wood or marb le – upon his own soul and intellect, and ma y so attain the highest nobleness and grandeur known on earth or in Heaven; ma y so be the greatest of artists, and of authors, and his life, which is far more than speech, ma y be eloquent. The great author or artist only portray s what every man should be. He conceives , what we should do . He conceives, and represents moral beauty, magnani mity, fortitude, love, devotion, forgiveness, the soul's greatness. He portray s virtues, com mended to our admiration and imitation. To embod y these portraitures in our lives is the practical realization of those great ideals of art. The magnani mity of Heroes, celebrated on the historic or poetic page; the constanc y and faith of Truth's mart yrs; the beaut y of love and piety glowing on the canvas; the delinea tions of Truth and Right, that flash from the lips of the Eloquent, are, in their essence only that which every man may feel and practise in the daily walks of life. The work of virtue is nobler than an y work of genius; for it is a nobler thing to be a hero than to describe one, to endure martyrdom than to paint it, to do right than to plead for it. Action is greater than writing. A good man is a nobler object of contemplation than a great author. There are but two things worth living for: to do what is worthy of being written; and to write what is worthy of being read; and the greater of these is the doing . Every man has to do the noblest thing that an y man can do or describe. There is a wide field for the courage, cheerfulness, energ y, and dignit y of human existence. Let therefore no Mason deem his life doomed to mediocr ity or meanness, to vanit y or unprofitable toil, or to any ends less than im mortal. No one can truly say that the grand prizes of life are for others, and he can do nothing. No mat ter how magnif icent and noble an act the author can Page 253 of 621"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike describe or the artist paint, it will be still nobler for you to go and do that which one describes, or be the model which the other draws. The loftiest action that ever was described is not more magnan imous than that which we may find occasion to do, in the dail y walks of life; in temptation, in distress, in bereave ment, in the solemn approach to death. In the great Providence of God, in the great ordinances of our being, there is opened to ever y man a sphere for the noblest action. It is not even in extraordinar y situations, where all eyes are upon u s, where all our energ y is aroused, and all our vigilance is awake, that the highest efforts of virtue are usually demanded of us; but rather in silence and seclusion, amidst our occupations and our homes; in wearing sickness, that m akes no compl aint; in sorel y-tried honesty , that asks no praise; in simp le disinterestedn ess, hiding the hand that resigns its advantage to another. Masonry seeks to ennoble common life. Its work is to go down into the obscure and unsearched records of dail y conduct and feeling; and to portra y, not the ordinary virtue of an extraordinar y life; but the more extraordinar y virtue of ordinar y life. What is done and borne in the shades of privac y, in the hard and beaten path of dail y care and toil, full of uncelebrat ed sacrifices; in the suffering, and someti mes insulted suffering, that wears to the world a cheerful brow; in the long strife of the spirit, resisting pain, penury , and neglect, carried on in the inmost depths of the heart; – what is done, and borne, and wrought, and won there, is a higher glory, and shall inherit a brighter crown. On the volume of Masonic life one bright word is written, from which on every side blazes an ineffable splendor. That word is D UTY. To aid in securing to all labor permanen t employment and its just reward: to help to hasten the coming of that time when no one shall stiffer from hunger or destitution, because, though willing and able to work, he can find no emplo yment, or because he has been overtaken by sickness in the midst of his labor, are part of y our duties as a Knight of the Royal Axe. A nd if we can succeed in mak ing some small nook of God' s creation a little more fruitful and cheerful, a little better and more worthy of Him, – or in making some one or two human hearts a little wiser, and more manful and hopeful and happ y, we shall have done work , worthy of Masons, and acceptab le to our Father in Heaven.

AMONG most of the Ancient Nations there was, in addition to their public worship, a private one styled the Mysteries; to which those onl y were admitted who had been prepared by certain ceremonies called initiations. The most widely disseminated of the ancient worships w ere those of Isis, O rpheus, Dionusos, Ceres and Mithras. Man y barbarous nations received the knowledge of the Mysteries in honor of these diviniti es from the Egyptians, before the y arrived in Greece; and even in the British Isles the Druids celebrated those of Dionuso s, learned by them from the Egyptians. The Mysteries of Eleusis, celebrated at Athens in honor of Ceres, swallowed up, as it were, all the others. All the neighboring nations neglect ed their own, to celebrate those of Eleusis; and in a little while all Greece and Asia Minor were filled with the Initiates. They spread into the Roman Empire, and even be yond its limits, \"those hol y and august Eleusinian Mysteries,\" said Cicero, \"in which the people of the remotest lands are initiated.\" Zosimus says that they embrac ed the whole human race; and Aristides ter med them the common temple of the whole world. There were, in the Eleusinian feasts, two sorts of Mys teries, the great, and the little. The latter were a kind of preparation for the former; and everybody was admi tted to them. Ordinaril y there was a novitiate of three, and sometimes of four ye ars. Clemens of Alexandria says that what was taught in the great Mysteries concerned the Universe, and was the completion and perfection of all instruction; wherein things were seen as the y were, and nature and her works were mad e known. The ancients said that the Initiates would be mor e happy after death than other mort als; and that, while the souls of the Profane on leaving their bodies, would be plunged in the mire, and remain buried in darknes s, those of the Initiat es would fly to the Fortunate Isles, the abode of the Gods. Plato said that the object of the M ysteries was to re-establish the soul in its primi tive purity, and in that state of perfection which it had lost. Epicte tus said, \"whatever is met with therein has been instituted by our Ma sters, for the instruction of man and the correction of morals.\" Proclus held that initiation elevated the soul, from a material, sensual, and purel y human life, to a comm union and celestia l intercourse with the Gods; and that a variet y of things, forms, and species were sho wn Initia tes, representing the first generation of the Gods. Purity of morals and elevation of soul were required of the Initiates. Candidates were required to be of spotless reputation and irreproachab le virtue. Nero, after murdering his mother, did not dare to be present at the celebration of the M ysteries: and Antony Page 255 of 621"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike presented himself to be initiated, as the most infallible mode of proving his innocence of the death of Avidius Cassius. The Initiates were regarded as the only fortunate men. \"It is upon us alone,\" says Aristophanes, \"shineth the beneficent day-star. We alone receive pleasure from the influence of his ray s; we, who are initiat ed, and who practise toward citiz en and stranger every possible act of justice and piet y.\" And it is therefore not surprising that, in time, initiation came to be considered as necessary as baptis m afterward was to the Christians; and that not to have been adm itted to the Mysteries was held a dishonor. \"It seems to me,\" says the great orator, philosopher, and mora list, Cicero, \"that Athens, among many excellent inventions, divine and very useful to the human family, has produced none compar able to the Mysteries, which for a wild and ferocious life have substituted human ity and urbanit y of manners. It is with good reason the y use the term initiat ion ; for it is through them that we in reality have learned the first principles of life; and they not onl y teach us to live in a mann er more consoling and agreeable, but they soften the pains of death by the hope of a better life hereafter.\" Where the Mysteries originated is not known. It is supposed that they came from India, by the way of Chaldæa, into Eg ypt, and thence were carried into Greece. Wherever they arose, they were practised among all the ancient nations; and, as wa s usual, the Thracians, Cretans, and Athenians each clai med the honor of invention, and each insisted that they had borrowed nothing from any other people. In Egypt and the East, all religion, even in its most poetical forms, was more or less a mystery; and the chief reason why , in Greece, a distinct name and office were assigned to the Mysteries, was because the superficial popular theolog y left a want unsatisfied, which religion in a wider sense alone could supply. They were practic al acknowledg ments of the insufficienc y of the popular religion to satisf y the deeper thoughts and aspirations of the mind. The vagueness of sy mbolism might perhaps reach what a more palpable and conventiona l creed could not. The former, by its indefinit eness, acknowledged the abstruseness of its subject; it treated a mysterious subject m ystically; it endeavored to illustrat e what it could not explain; to excite an appropriate feeling, if it could not develop an adequate idea; and mad e the image a mere subordinate convey ance for the conception, which itself never became too obvious or famil iar. The instruction now convey ed by books and letters was of old convey ed by symbols; and the priest had to invent or to perpetuate a displa y of rites and exhibitions, which were not only more attractive to the e ye than words, but often to the mind more suggestive and pregnant with m eaning. Afterward, the institution became rather moral and politica l, than religious. The civil magistrates shaped the cere monies to politica l ends in Egypt; the sages who carried them from that country to Asia, Greece, and the North of Europe, were all kings or legislators. The chief magistra te presided at those of Eleusis, represented by an officer st yled King : and the Priest pla yed but a subordinate part. Page 256 of 621"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Powers revered in the Mysteries were all in realit y Nature-Gods; none of whom could be consistently addressed as mere heroes, because their nature was confessedly super- heroic. The Mysteries, only in fact a more solemn expression of the religion of the ancient poetry, taught that doctrine of the Theocrac ia or Divine Onenes s, which even poetr y does not entirely conceal. They were not in any open hostilit y with the popular religion,. but only a more solemn exhibition of its sy mbols; or rather a part of itself in a mor e impressive form. The essence of all M ysteries, as of all pol ytheism, consists in this, that the conception of an unapproachable Being, single, eternal, and unchanging, and, that of a God of Nature, whose man ifold power is imm ediately revealed to the senses in the incessant round of move ment, life, and death, fell asunder in the treatment, and were separatel y symbolized. They offered a perpetual problem to excite curiosit y, and contributed to satisfy the all-pervading religious sentiment, which if it obtain no nourishmen t among the simpl e and intelligib le, finds comp ensating excitem ent in a reverential contemp lation of the obscure. Nature is as free from dogmatis m as from tyranny; and the earliest instructors of mankind not only adopted her lessons, but as far as pos sible adhered to her method of impart ing them. They attempted to reach the understanding through the eye; and the greater part of all religious teaching was conve yed through this ancient and most impressive mode of \"exhibition\" or demonstra tion. The Mysteries were a sacred drama, exhibiting some legend significant of Nature's change, of the visible Universe in which the divinit y is revealed, and whose import was in many respects as open to the Pagan, as to the Christian. Beyond the current traditions or sacred recitals of the temple, few explanations were given to the spectators, who were left, as in the school of nature, to make inferences for themse lves. The method of indirect suggestion, by allegor y or symbol, is a more efficacious instrum ent of instruction than plain didactic language; since we are habituall y indifferent to that which is acquired without effort: \"The initiated are few, though m any bear the thyrsus.\" And it would have been impossibl e to provide a lesson suited to ever y degree of cultiva tion and capacity, unless it were one framed after Nature' s example, or rather a representation of Nature herself, emp loying her universal symbolism instead of technica lities of language, inviting endless research, y et rewarding the humbl est inquirer, and disclosing its secrets to every one in proportion to his preparator y training and power to compr ehend them. Even if destitute of any formal or official enunciat ion of those i mportant truths, which even in a cultivated age it was often found inexpedien t to assert except under a veil of allegor y, and which moreover lose their dignity and value in proportion as they are learned mechanically as dogmas, the shows of the M ysteries certain ly contained suggestions if not lessons, which in the opinion not of one comp etent witness only , but of man y, were adapted to elevate the character of the spectators. enabling them to augur something of the purposes of existence, as well as of the me ans of improving it, to live better and to die happier. Unlike the religion of book s or creeds, these m ystic shows and perfor mances were not the reading of a lecture, but the opening of a problem, implying neither exemp tion from research, nor hostilit y to philosophy : for, on the contrar y, philosophy is the great Mystagogue or Arch-Expounder of symbolism: though the interpretat ions by the Grecian Page 257 of 621"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Philosoph y of the old myths and symbols were in man y instances as ill-founded, as in others they are correct. No better means could be devised to rouse a dorm ant intellect, than those impressive exhibitions, which addressed it through the i magina tion: which, instead of condemn ing it to a prescribed routine of creed, invited it to seek, compare, and judge. The alterat ion from symbol to dogma is as fatal to beaut y of expression, as that from faith to dogma is to truth and wholesom eness of thought. The first philosoph y often reverted to the natural mode of teaching; and Socrates, in particul ar, is said to have eschewed dogm as, endeavoring, like the Mysteries, rather to awaken and develop in the minds of his hearers the ideas with which the y were alread y endowed or pregnant, than to fill them with read y-made adventitious opinions. So Masonry still follows the ancient manner of teaching. Her symbols are the instruction she gives; and the lectures are but often partial and insufficient one-sided endeavors to interpret those s ymbols. He who w ould become an accom plished Mason, must not be content merely to hear or even to understand the lectures, but must, aided by them, and they having as it were mark ed out the way for him, study, interpret, and develop the symbols for himse lf. The earliest speculation endeavored to express far more than it could distinctl y comprehend; and the vague impressions of the mind found in the m ysterious analogies of phenom ena their most apt and energeti c representations. The Mysteries, like the symbols of Masonry , were but an image of the eloquent analogies of Nature; both those and these revealing no new secret to such as were or are unprepared, or incapable of interpreting their significance. Everywhere in the old Mysteries, and in all the symbolisms and cere monial of the Hierophant was found the same mythical personage, who, like Hermes, or Zoroaster, unites Human Attributes with Divine, and is himself the God w hose worship he introduced, teaching rude men the com mencements of civili zation through the influence of song, and connecting with the symbol of his death, emblematic of that of Nature, the most essential consolations of religion. The Mysteries embraced the three great doctrines of Ancient Theosoph y. They treated of God, Man, and Nature. Dionusos, who se Mysteries Orpheus is said to have founded, was the God of N ature, or of the moisture which is the life of Nature, who prepares in darkness the return of life and vegetation, or who is himself the Light and Change evolving their varieties. He was theologica lly one with Hermes, Prometheus, and Poseidon. In the Egean Islands he is Butes, Dardanus, Himeros, or Imbros. In Crete he appears as Iasius or Zeus, whose wor ship remain ing unveiled by the usual forms of mystery, betrayed to profane curiosit y the symbols, which, if irreverent ly contemplated, were sure to be misunderstood. In Asia he is the long-stoled Bassareus coalescing with the Sabazius of the Phrygian Corybantes: the same with the mystic Iacchus, nursling or son of Ceres, and with the dismembered Zagreus, son of Persephoné. Page 258 of 621"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike In symbolical forms the Mysteries exhibited THE ONE, of which THE MANIFOLD is an infinite illustration, containing a moral lesson, calcul ated to guide the soul through life, and to cheer it in death. The story of Dionu sos was profoundly significant. He was not onl y creator of the world, but guardian, liberator, and Savior of the soul. God of the many- colored mantle, he was the resulting manifestation personified, the all in the man y, the varied year, life passing into innumerable forms. The spiritual regeneration of man was typified in the Mysteries by the second birth of Dionusos as off spring of the Highest; and the agents and s ymbols of that regeneration were the elements that affected Nature's periodica l purification – the air, indicated by the mystic fan or winno w; the fire, signified by the torch; and the baptism al water, for water is not only cleanser of all things, but the genesis or source of all. These notions, clothed in ritual, suggested the soul's reforma tion and training, the mor al purity formal ly proclai med at Eleusis. He onl y was invited to approach, who was \"of clean hands and ingenuous speech, free from all pollution, and with a clear conscience.\" \"Happy the man,\" say the initiated in Euripides and Aristophanes, \"who purifies his life, and who reverentl y consecrates his soul in the thiăsos of the God. Let him take heed to his lips that he utter no profane word; let him be just and kind to the stranger, and to his neighbor; let him give way to no vicious excess, lest he mak e dull and heav y the organs of the spirit. Far from the mystic dance of the thiăsos be the impure, the evil speaker, the seditious citiz en, the selfish hunter after gain, the traitor; all those, in short, whose practic es are more akin to the riot of Titans than to the regulated life of the Orphici, or the Curetan order of the Priests of Idæan Zeus.\" The votary, elevated beyond the sphere of his ordinar y faculties, and unable to account for the agitation which overpowered hi m, seemed to becom e divine in proportion as he ceased to be human; to be a dæmon or god. Already , in imagination, the initiated were numbered among the beatifi ed. They alone enjoyed the true life, the Sun 's true lustre, while they hymned their God beneath the mystic groves of a mi mic Elysium, and were reall y renovated or regenerated under the genial influence of their dances. \"They whom Proserpina guides in her mysteries,\" it was said, \"who imbib ed her instruction and spiritual nourishment, rest from their labors and know strife no more. Happy they who witness and co mprehend these sacred cere monies! They are made to know the me aning of the riddle of existence by observing its aim and term ination as appointed by Zeus; they partake a benefit more valuable and enduring than the grain bestowed by Ceres; for the y are exalted in the scale of intellec tual existence, and obtain sweet hopes to console the m at their death.\" No doubt the ceremon ies of initia tion were originall y few and simp le. As the great truths of the primitive revelation faded out of the memories of the masses of the People, and wickedness beca me rife upon the earth, it became necessary to discri minate, to require longer probation and satisfactor y tests of the candidates, and by spreading around what at first were rather schools of instruction than m ysteries, the veil of secrecy , and the pomp of ceremony, to heighten the opinion of their value and impor tance. Page 259 of 621"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Whatever pictures later and especiall y Christian writers may draw of the Mysteries, they must, not only originall y, but for man y ages, have continued pure; and the doctrines of natural religion and morals there taught, have been of the highest i mportanc e; because both the most virtuous as well as the most learned and philosophic of the ancients speak of them in the loftiest terms. That they ultimately became degraded from their high estate, and corrupted, we know. The rites of initi ation became progressivel y more complicated. Signs and tokens were invented by which the Children of Light could with facilit y make themselv es known to each other. Different Degrees were invented, as the number of Initiates enlarged, in order that there might be in the inner apartm ent of the Te mple a favored few, to whom alone the more valuable secrets were entrusted, and who could wield effectuall y the influence and power of the Order. Originall y the Mysteries were m eant to be the beginning of a new life of reason and virtue. The initiated or esoteric compan ions were taught the doctrine of the One Supreme God, the theory of death and eternit y, the hidden mysteries of Nature, the prospect of the ultimate restoration of the soul to that state of perfection from which it had fallen, its immortality, and the states of reward and punishment after death. The uninitia ted were deemed Profane, unworthy of public employment or private confidence, sometimes proscribed as Atheists, and certain of ever-lasting punishmen t beyond the grave. All person s were initia ted into the lesser My steries; but few attained the greater, in which the true spirit of them, and most of their secret doctrines were hidden. The veil of secrec y was impen etrable, sealed by oaths and penalti es the most tremendous and appalling. It was by initiation only, that a knowledge of the Hierogl yphics could be obtained, with which the walls, columns, and ceilings of the Te mples were decorated, and which, believed to have been communicated to the Priests b y revelation from the celestial deities, the youth of all ranks were laudabl y ambitious of deciphering. The ceremon ies were perform ed at dead of night, generall y in apartm ents under-ground, but sometimes in the centre of a vast p yramid, with every appliance that could alar m and excite the candidate. Innumerab le ceremonies, wild and roman tic, dreadful and appalling, had by degrees been added to the few expressive s ymbols of prim itive observances, under which there were instances in which the terrified aspirant actuall y expired with fear. The pyramids were probabl y used for the purposes of initiation, as were caverns, pagodas, and labyrinths; for the cere monies required many apartm ents and cells, long passages and wells. In Egy pt a principal place for the Mysteries was the island of Philæ on the Nile, where a magnifi cent Temple of Osiris stood, and his relics were said to be preserved. With their natural proclivit ies, the Priesthood, that select and exclusive class, in Egypt, India, Phœnicia, Judea and Greece, as well as in Britain and Rome, and wherever else the Mysteries were known, mad e use of them to build wider and higher the fabric of their own power. The purity of no religion continues long. Rank and dignities succeed to the primitive simplicity. Unprincipled, vain, insolent, corrupt, and venal m en put on God' s livery to serve the Devil withal; and luxur y, vice, intolerance, and pride depose frugalit y, virtue, gentleness, and humi lity, and change the altar where they should be servants, to a throne on which the y reign.

And accordingl y Zosimus thought that the neglect of the Mysteries after Diocletian abdicated, was the chief cause of the decline of the Roman Empire; and in the year 364, the Proconsul of Greece would not close the Mysteries, notwithstanding a law of the Emperor Valentinian, lest the people should be driven to desperation, if prevented from perform ing them; upon which, as they believed, the welfare of mank ind wholly depended. The y were practised in Athens until the 8th centur y, in Greece and Rome for several centuries after Christ; and in Wales and Scotland down to the 12th century . The inhabitants of India originall y practised the Patriarchal religion. Even the later worship of Vishnu was cheerful and social; accompanied with the festive song, the sprightl y dance, and the resounding c ymbal, with libations of milk and hone y, garlands, and perfum es from aromatic woods and gums. There perhaps the Mysteries commenced; and in them, under allegories, were taught the primitive truths. We cannot, within the limits of this lecture, detail the cere monies of initiation; and shall use general language, except where something from those old Mysteries still remains in Masonry. The Initiate was invested with a cord of three threads, so twined as to make three ti mes three, and called zenna r . Hence comes our cable- tow. It was an emblem of their tri-une Deity, the remembrance of whom we also preserve in the three chief officers of our Lodges, presiding in the three quarters of that Universe which our Lodges represent; in our three greater and three lesser lights, our three movabl e and three immovable jewels, and the three pillars that support our Lodges. The Indian M ysteries were celebrated in subterranean caverns and grottos hewn in the solid rock; and the Initiates adored the Deity, symbolized by the solar fire. The candidat e, long wandering in darkness, trul y wanted Light, and the worship taught him was the worship of God, the Source of Light. The vast Te mple of Elephanta, perhaps the oldest in the world, hewn out of the rock, and 135 feet square, was u sed for initiations; as were the still vaster caverns of Salsette, with their 300 apartm ents. The periods of initia tion were regulated by the increase and decrease of the moon. The Mysteries were divided into four steps or Degrees. The candidate might receive the first at eight years of age, when he was invested with the zennar. Each Degree dispensed something of perfection. \"Let the wretched man,\" says the Hitopadesa, \"practise virtue, whenever he enjoy s one of the three or four religious Degrees; let him be even- minded with all created things, and that disposition will be the source of virtue.\" After various ceremon ies, chiefly relating to the unity and trinity of the Godhead, the candidate was clothed in a linen garment without a seam, and rema ined under the care of a Brahmin until he was twent y years of age, constantl y studying and practising the most rigid virtue.

Then he was admit ted to the Hol y Cavern, blazing with light, where, in costl y robes, sat, in the East, West, and South, the three chief Hierophants, representing the Indian tri- une Deity. The cere monies there commenced with an anthem to the Great God of Nature; and then followed this apostrophe: \"O migh ty Being! greater than Brahma! we bow down before Thee as the prim al Creator! Eternal God of Gods! The World's Mansion! Thou art the Incorruptible Being, distinct from all things transient! Thou art before all Gods, the Ancient Absolute Existence, and the Supreme Supporter of the Universe! Thou art the Supreme Mansion; and by Thee, O Infinite Form, the Universe was spread abroad.\" The candidate, thus taught the first great primitive truth, was called upon to make a forma l declarat ion, that he would be tract-able and obedient to his superiors; that he would keep his bod y pure; govern his tongue, and observe a passive obedience in receiving the doctrines and traditions of the Order; and the firm est secrecy in maintaining inviolabl e its hidden and abstruse m ysteries. Then he was s prinkled with water (whence our baptis m); certain words, now unkno wn, were whispered in his ear; and he was divested of his s hoes, and made to go three times around the cavern. Hence our three circuits; hence we were neither barefoot nor shod: and the word s were the Pass-w ords of that Indian Degree. The Gymnosophist Priests came from the banks of the Euphrates into Ethiopia, and brought with them their sciences and their doctrines. Their principal College was at Meroe, and their M ysteries were celebrated in the Temple of Amun, renowned for his oracle. Ethiopia was then a powerful State, which preceded Egypt in civiliza tion, and had a theocrat ic governm ent. Above the King was the Priest, who could put him to death in the name of the Deity. Egypt was then composed of the Thebaid only. Middle Eg ypt and the Delta were a gulf of the Mediterrane an. The Nile by degrees formed an immense marsh, which, afterward drained by the labor of man, formed Lower Egypt; and was for man y centuries governed by the Ethiopi an Sacerdotal Caste, of Arabic origin; afterward displaced by a dynasty of warriors. The magn ificent ruins of Axoum, with its obelisks and hieroglyphics, temples, vast tombs and pyramids, around ancient Meroe, are far older than the pyramids near Memphis. The Priests, taught by Hermes, embodi ed in books the occult and herme tic sciences, with their own discoveries and the revelat ions of the Sib yls. They studied particularl y the most abstract sciences, discovered the famous geometr ical theorems which Pythagoras afterward learned from them, calculated eclipses, and regulated, nineteen centuries before Cæsar, the Julian year. They descended to practical investigations as to the necessities of life, and made known their discoveries to the people; they cultivat ed the fine arts, and inspired the people with that enthusias m which produced the avenues of Thebes, the Labyrinth, the Temples of Karnac, Denderah, Edfou, and Philæ, the monoli thic obelisks, and the great Lake Moeris, the fertilizer of the countr y. The wisdom of the Eg yptian Initiates, the high sciences and loft y morality which they taught, and their immense knowledge, excited the emulation of the most eminen t men, whatever their rank and fortune; and led the m, despite the compli cated and terrible trials to be undergone, to seek admission into the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis.

Osiris changed his nam e, and beco me Adoni or Dionusos, still the representat ive of the Sun; and afterward these Mysteries were introduced successivel y into Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Sicily, and Italy. In Greece and Sicil y, Osiris took the name of Bacchus, and Isis that of Ceres, Cybele, Rhea and Venu s. Bar Hebraeus says: \"Enoch was the first who invented books and different sorts of writing. The ancient Greeks declare that Enoch is the same as Mercury Trismegistus [Hermes], and that he taught the sons of men the art of building cities, and enacted some admirable laws... He discovered the knowledge of the Zodiac, and the course of the Planets; and he pointed out to the sons of men, that they should wor ship God, that they should fast, that they should pra y, that the y should give alms, votive offerings, and tenths. He reprobated abominable foods and drunkenness, and appointed festivals for sacrifices to the Sun, at each of the Zodiacal Signs.\" Manetho extracted his histor y from certain pillars which he discovered in Egypt, whereon inscriptions had been made by Thoth, or the first Mercur y [or Hermes], in the sacred letters and dialect: but which were after the flood translated from that dialect into the Greek tongue, and laid up in the private recesses of the Egyptian Temples. These pillars were found in subterranean caverns, near Thebes and be yond the Nile, not far from the sounding statue of Memnon, in a place called Syringes; which are described to be certain winding apartments underground; mad e, it is said, b y those who were skilled in ancient rites; who, foreseeing the coming of the Deluge, and fearing lest the memory of their ceremon ies should be obliterated, built and contrived vaults, dug with vast labor, in several places. From the bosom of Egy pt sprang a man of consum mate wisdom, initiated in the secret knowledge of India, of Persia, and of Ethiopia, named Thoth or Phtha b y his comp atriots, Taut by the Phœnicians, Hermes Trismegistus by the Greeks, and Adris by the Rabbins. Nature seemed to have chosen him for her favorite, and to have lavished on him all the qualities necessary to enable him to study her and to know her thoroughl y. The Deity had, so to sa y, infused into him the sciences and the arts, in order that he might instruct the whole world. He invented many things necessar y for the uses of life, and gave the m suitable names; he taught men how to write down their thoughts and arrange their speech; he instituted the ceremonies to be observed in the worship of each of the Gods; he observed the course of the stars; he invented music, the different bodily exercises, arith metic, medicine, the art of working in metals, the lyre with three strings; he regulated the three tones of the voice, the sharp , taken from autumn, the grave from winter, and the middle from spring, there being then but three seasons. It wa s he who taught the Greeks the mode of interpreting terms and things, whence they gave him the nam e of Ἑ ρμης [ Hermes ], which signifies Interpreter . In Egypt he instituted hierogl yphics: he selected a certain number of persons w hom he judged fitted to be the depositaries of his secrets, of such only as were capable of attain ing the throne and the first offices in the Mysteries; he united them in a bod y, created them Priests of the Living God , instructed them in the sciences and arts, and explained to them the symbols by which the y were veiled.

It is to Hermes, who lived at that period, that we must attribute the concealm ent or veiling [ velation ] of the Indian worship, which Moses unveiled or revealed , changing nothing of the laws of Hermes, except the pluralit y of his m ystic Gods. The Egyptian Priests related that Hermes, dying, said: \"Hitherto I have lived an exile from my true countr y: now I return thither. Do not weep for me: I return to that celestial country whither each goes in his turn. There is God. This life is but a death.\" This is precisel y the creed of the old Buddhists of Samane ans, who believed that from time to time God sent Buddhas on earth, to reform men, to wean them from their vices, and lead them back into the paths of virtue. Among the sciences taught b y Hermes, there were secrets which he communicated to the Initiates only upon condition that they should bind the mselves, by a terrible oath, never to divulge them, except to those w ho, after long trial, should be found worthy to succeed them. The Kings even prohibited the revelation of them on pain of death. This secret was styled the Sacerdotal Art, and included alchemy, astrology , magism [magic], the science of spirits, etc. He gave them the key to the Hierogly phics of all these secret sciences, which were regarded as sacred, and kept concealed in the most secret places of the Te mple. The great secrecy observed by the initia ted Priests, for man y years, and the lofty sciences which they professed, caused the m to be honored and respected throughout all Egypt, which was regarded by other nations as the college, the sanctuar y, of the sciences and arts. The mystery which surrounded them strongly excited curiosit y. Orpheus meta morphosed himself, so to sa y, into an Egyptian. He was initiated into Theolog y and Phy sics. And he so completely made the ideas and reasonings of his teachers his own, that his Hymns rather bespeak an Egy ptian Priest than a Grecian Poet: and the was the first who carried into Greece the Egyptian fables. Pythagoras, ever thirst y for learning, consented even to be circum cised, in order to beco me one of the Initiates: and the occult sciences were revealed to him in the innermost part of the sanctuar y. The Initiates in a particular science, having been instructed by fables, enig mas, allegori es, and hierogly phics, wrote mysteriously whenever in their works they touched the subject of the Mysteries, and continued to conceal science under a veil of fictions. When the destruction by Cambyses of man y cities, and the ruin of nearly all Egypt, in the year 528 before our era, dispersed most of the Priests into Greece and elsewhere, they bore with them their sciences, which the y continued to teach enigma tically, that is to say, ever enveloped in the obscurities of fables and hierogl yphics; to the end that the vulgar herd, seeing, might see nothing, and hearing, might comprehend nothing. All the writers drew from this source: but these M ysteries, conceal ed under so man y unexplained envelopes, ended in giving birth to a swarm of absurdities, which, from Greece, spread over the whole earth. In the Grecian Mysteries, as established by Pythagoras, there were three Degrees. A preparation of five y ears' abstinence and silence was required. If the candidate was found Page 264 of 621"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike to be passionate or intemp erate, contentious, or amb itious of worldl y honors and distinctions, he was rejected. In his lectures, Pythagoras taught the ma thematics, as a medium whereby to prove the existence of God from observation and by means of reason; gramm ar, rhetoric, and logic, to cultivate and improve that reason, arithm etic, because he conceived that the ulti mate benefit of man consisted in the science of numb ers, and geome try, music, and astronom y, because he conceived that man is indebted to them for a knowledge of what is reall y good and useful. He taught the true me thod of obtaining a knowledge of the Divine laws of purif ying the soul from its imperf ections, of searching for truth, and of practising virtue; thus imi tating the perfections of God. He thought his s ystem vain, if it did not contribute to expel vice and introduce virtue into the mind. He taught that the two most excellen t things were, to speak the truth, and to render benefits to one another. Particularl y he inculcat ed Silence, Temperanc e, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. He taught the immortality of the soul, the Omnipot ence of God, and the necessit y of personal holiness to qualif y a man for admission into the Society of the Gods. Thus we owe the particular mode of instruction in the Degree of Fellow-Craft to Pythagoras; and that Degree is but an imperf ect reproduction of his lectures. From him, too, we have man y of our explanations of the symbols. He arranged his assembl ies due East and West, because he held that Motion began in the East and proceeded to the West. Our Lodges are said to be due East and West, because the Master represents the rising Sun, and of cour se must be in the East. The pyramids, too, were built precisel y by the four cardinal points. And our expression, that our Lodges extend upward to the Heavens, comes from the Persian and Druidic custom of having to their Temples no roofs but the sk y. Plato developed and spirituali zed the philosophy of Pythagoras. Even Eusebius the Christian admits, that he reached to the vestibule of Truth, and stood upon its threshold. The Druidical ceremonies undoubtedl y came from India; and the Druids were originall y Buddhists. The word Druidh , like the word Magi , signifies wise or learned men; and they were at once philosophers, magistra tes, and divines. There was a surprising uniformi ty in the Temples, Priests, doctrines, and worship of the Persian Magi and British Druids. The Gods of Britain were the same as the Cabiri of Samothr ace. Osiris and Isis appeared in their Mysteries, under the names of Hu and Ceridwen; and like those of the prim itive Persians, their Temples were enclosures of huge unhewn stones, some of which still remain, and are regarded b y the common people with fear and veneration. They were generall y either circular or oval. Some were in the shape of a circle to which a vast serpent was attached. The circle was an Eastern s ymbol of the Universe, governed by an Omnipot ent Deity whose centre is every where, and his circumference nowhere: and the egg was an universal symbol of the world. Some of the Temples were winged, and some in the shape of a cross; the winged ones referring to Kneph, the winged Serpent- Deity of Egypt; whence the nam e of Navestock , where one of them stood. Te mples in the shape of a cross were also found in Ireland and Scotland. The length of one of these vast structures, in the shape of a serpent, was nearl y three miles. Page 265 of 621"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The grand periods for initia tion into the Druidical Mysteries, were quarterl y; at the equinoxes and solstices. In the remo te times when the y originated, these were the ti mes corresponding with the 13th of Februar y, 1st of Ma y, 19th of August, and 1st of November. The time of annual celebra tion was May -Eve, and the cere monial preparations commenced at midnight, on the 29th of April. When the initia tions were over, on May- Eve, fires were kindled on all the cairns and cro mlechs in the island, which burned all night to introduce the sports of May -day. The festival was in honor of the Sun. The initiations were perfor med at midnigh t; and there were three Degrees. The Gothic M ysteries were carried Northward from the East, b y Odin; who, being a great warrior, modell ed and varied them to suit his purpo ses and the genius of his people. He placed over their celebration twelve Hierophants, who w ere alike Priests, Counsellors of State, and Judges from whose decision there was no appeal. He held the numbers three and nine in peculiar veneration, and was probabl y himself the Indian Buddha. Ever y thrice-three months, thrice-three victims were sacrificed to the tri- une God. The Goths had three great festivals; the most magnifi cent of which commenced at the winter solstice, and was celebrated in honor of Thor, the Prince of the Power of the Air. That being the longest night in the year, and the one after which the Sun comes Northward, it was comm emorative of the Creation; and they termed it mother- night, as the one in which the creation of the world and light from the prim itive darkness took place. This was the Yule , Juul , or Yeol feast, which afterward became Christm as. At this feast the initiations were celebra ted. Thor was the Sun, the Eg yptian Osiris and Kneph, the Phœnician Bel or Baal. The initiations were had in huge intricate caverns, ter minating, as all the Mithriac caverns did, in a spacious vault, where the candidate was brought to light . Joseph wa s undoubtedl y initiated. After he had interpret ed Pharaoh's dream, that Monarch made him his Prime Minister, let him ride in his second chariot, while the y proclai med before him, ABRECH! 1 and set him over the land of Eg ypt. In addition to this, the King gave him a new name, Tsapanat- Paänakh, and marr ied him to Asanat, daughter of Potai Parang, a Priest of An or Hieropolis, where was the Temple of Athom- Re, the Great God of Egypt; thus comp letely naturali zing him. He could not have contract ed this marriage, nor have exercised that high dignit y, without being first initiated in the Mysteries. When his Brethren came to Egypt the second tim e, the Egyptians of his court could not eat with them, as that would have been abomin ation, though the y ate with Jo seph; who w as therefore regarded not as a foreigner, but as one of themse lves: and when he sent and brought his brethren back, and charged them with taking his cup, he said, \"Kno w ye not that a man like me practises divination?\" thus assuming the Egyptian of high rank initiated into the Mysteries, and as such conversant with the occult sciences. So also must Moses have been initiated: for he was not only brought up in the court of the King, as the adopted son of the King's daughter, until he was forty years of age; but he was instructed in all the learning of the Egyptians, and marr ied afterward the daughter of Yethr , ū a Priest of An likewise. Strabo and Diodorus both assert that he was himself a Priest of Heliopolis. Before he went into the Desert, there were intim ate relations between him and the Priesthood; and he had successfull y commanded, Josephus informs us, an Page 266 of 621"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike army sent by the King against the Ethiopians. Simplicius asserts that Moses received from the Egyptians, in the Mysteries, the doctrines which he taught to the Hebrews: and Clemens of Alexandria and Philo say that he was a Theologian and Prophet, and interpreter of the Sacred Laws. Manetho, cited by Josephus, sa ys he was a Priest of Heliopolis, and that his true and original (Egyptian) name was Asersaph or Osarsiph. And in the institution of the Hebrew Priesthood, in the powers and privileges, as well as the immunities and sanctit y which he conferred upon the m, he closely imitated the Egyptian institutions; making public the worship of that Deit y whom the Egyptian Initiates worshipped in private; and strenuousl y endeavoring to keep t he people from relapsing into their old mixture of Chaldaic and Egyptian superstition and idol-worship, as they were ever ready and inclined to do; even Ahar n, upon their first clamorous discontent, restoring ū the worship of Apis; as an image of which Egyp tian God he made the golden calf. The Egyptian Priests taught in their great Mysteries, that there was one God, S upreme and Unapproachable, who had conceived the Universe by His Intellig ence, before He created it by His Po wer and Will. They were no Materialists nor Pantheists; but taught that Matter was not eternal or co-existent with the great First Cause, but created by Him. The early Christians, taught by the founder of their Religion, but in greater perfection, those primitive truths that from the Egyptians had pas sed to the Jews, and been preserved among the latter by the Essenes, received also the institution of the Mysteries; adopting as their object the building of the symbolic Temple, preserving the old Scriptures of the Jews as their sacred book, and as the fundam ental law, which furnished the new veil of initia tion with the Hebraic words and formulas, that, corrupted and disfigured by time and ignorance, appear in many of our Degrees. Such, m y Brother, is the doctrine of the first Degree of, the Mysteries, or that of Chief of the Tabernacle, to which y ou have now been admi tted, and the moral lesson of w hich is, devotion to the service of God, and disinterested zeal and constant endeavor for the welfare of men. You have here received only hints of the true objects and purpo ses of the Mysteries.

SYMBOLS were the almost universal language of ancient theolog y. They were the most obvious me thod of instruction; for, like nature herself, they addressed the understanding through the eye; and the most ancient expressions denoting communication of religious knowledge, signify ocular exhibition. The first teachers of mankind borrowed this method of instruction; and it comprised an endless store of pregnant hierogl yphics. These lessons of the olden ti me were the riddles of the Sphynx, tempting the curious by their quaintness, but involving the personal risk of the adventurous interpreter. \"The God s themselves,\" it was said, \"disclose their intentions to the wise, but to fools their teaching is unintelligib le;\" and the King of the Delphic Oracle was said not to declare , nor on the other hand to conceal ; but empha tically to \" intimate or signify .\" The Ancient Sages, both barbarian and Greek, involved their meaning in similar indirect ions and enigm as; their lessons were convey ed either in visible symbols, or in those \"parables and dark sayings of old,\" which the Israelites considered it a sacred duty to hand down unchanged to successive generations. The explanator y tokens employed by man, whether emblematical objects or actions, symbol's or mystic ceremonies, were like the mystic signs and portents either in drea ms or by the wa yside, supposed to be significant of the intentions of the Gods; both required the aid of anxious thought and skillful interpret ation. It was only by a correct appreciat ion of analogous problems of nature, that the will of Heaven could be understood b y the Diviner, or the lessons of Wisdom becom e manifest to the Sage. The Mysteries were a series of symbols; and what was spoken there consisted wholl y of accessor y explanations of the act or i mage; sacred com mentaries, explanator y of established symbols; with little of those independent traditions embod ying physical or moral speculation, in which the elements or planets were the actors, and the creation and revolutions of the world were interm ingled with recolle ctions of ancient events: and yet with so much of that also, that nature became her own expositor through the medium of an arbitrar y symbolical instruction; and the ancient views of the relation between the human and divine received dramat ic forms. There has ever been an inti mate alliance between the two systems, the symbolic and the philosophical, in the allegories of the monum ents of all ages, in the symbolic writings of the priests of all nations, in the rituals of all secret and mysterious societies; there has been a constant series, an invariable uniformit y of principles, which com e from an aggregate, vast, imposing, and true, composed of parts that fit harmon iously only there. Symbolical instruction is recom mended by the constant and unifor m usage of antiquit y; and it has retained its influence throughout all ages, as a s ystem of mysterious communication. The Deit y, in his revelations to man, adopted the use of mat erial images for the purpose of enforcing sublime truths; and Christ taught by symbols and parables. The mysterious knowledge of the Druids was embodied in signs and s ymbols. Taliesin, Page 268 of 621"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike describing his initia tion, says: \"The secrets were i mparted to me by the old Giantess ( Ceridwen , or Isis ), without the use of audible language.\" And again he says, \"I am a silent proficient.\" Initiation was a school, in which were taught the truths of primi tive revelation, the existence and attributes of one God, the immortality of the Soul, rewards and punishmen ts in a future life, the phenomen a of Nature, the arts, the sciences, morality, legislat ion, philosoph y, and philanthrop y, and what we now style psychology and me taphysics, with animal magnet ism, and the other occult sciences. All the ideas of the Priests of Hindostan, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Chaldæa, Phœnicia, were known to the Egyptian Priests. The rational Indian philosophy , after penetrating Persia and Chaldæa, gave birth to the Egyptian Mysteries. We find that the use of Hierogly phics was preceded in Egypt by that of the easily understood sy mbols and figures, from the min eral, animal, and vegetable kingdoms, used by the Indians, Per sians, and Chaldæans to express their thoughts; and this pri mitive philosoph y was the basis of the modern philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato. All the philosophers and legislators that made Antiquity illustrious, were pupils of the initiation; and all the beneficent modifications in the religions of the different people instructed by them were owing to their institution and extension of the M ysteries. In the chaos of popular superstitions, those My steries alone kept m an from lapsing into absolute brutishness. Zoroaster and Confucius drew their doctrines from the Mysteries. Clemens of Alexandria, speaking of the Great Mysteries, says: \"Here ends all instruction. Nature and all things are seen and known.\" Had moral truths alone been taught the Initiate, the Mysteries could never have deserved nor received the magn ificent eulogiu ms of the most enlighten ed men of Antiquity, – of Pindar, Plutarch, Isocrates, Diodorus, Plato, Euripides, Socrates, Aristophanes, Cicero, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and others; – philosophers hostile to the Sacerdotal Spirit, or historians devoted to the investigation of Truth. No: all the sciences were taught there; and those oral or written traditions briefly communicated, which reached back to the first age of the world. Socrates said, in the Phædo of Plato: \"It well appears that those who established the Mysteries, or secret assembl ies of the initiated, were no contem ptible personages, but men of great genius, who in the early ages strove to teach us, under enigmas, that he who shall go to the invisible regions without being purified, will be precipitat ed into the abyss; while he who arrives there, purged of the stains of this world, and acco mplished in virtue, will be admitted to the dwelling- place of the Deity... The initiated are certain to attain the company of the Gods.\" Pretextatus, Proconsul of Achaia, a man endowed with all the virtues, said, in the 4th century, that to deprive the Greeks of those Sacred M ysteries which bound together the whole human race, would make life insupportable. Initiation was considered to be a m ystical death; a descent into the infernal regions, where every pollution, and the stains and i mperfec tions of a corrupt and evil life were purged away by fire and water; and the perfect Epopt was then said to be regenerated , new- born , Page 269 of 621"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike restored to a renovated existence of life , light , and purity ; and placed under the Divine Protection. A new language was adapted to these celebra tions, and also a language of hierogl yphics, unknown to an y but those who had received the highest Degree. And to them ultimately were confined the learning, the morality, and the politica l power of ever y people a mong which the Mysteries were practised. So effectual ly was the knowledge of the hierogly phics of the highest Degree hidden from all but a favored few, that in process of tim e their meaning was entirel y lost, and none could interpret them. If the same hierogl yphics were employed in the higher as in the lower Degrees, the y had a different and more abstruse and figurative meaning. It was pretended, in later times, that the sacred hierogl yphics and language were the same that were used by the Celestial Deities. Everything that could heighten the mystery of initiation was added, until the very name of the cere mony possessed a strange char m, and yet conjured up the wildest fears. The greatest rapture came to be expressed by the word that signified to pass through the Mysteries. The Priesthood posse ssed one third of Eg ypt. They gained much of their influence by means of the M ysteries, and spared no means to impress the people with a full sense of their importance. They represented them as the beginning of a new life of reason and virtue: the initia ted, or esoteric companions were said to entertain the most agreeable anticipations respecting death and eternity, to compr ehend all the hidden mysteries of Nature, to have their souls restored to the original perfection from which man had fallen; and at their death to be borne to the celestial mansions of the Gods. The doctrines of a future state of rewards and punishments formed a promin ent feature in the M ysteries; and they were also believed to assure much temporal happiness and good-fortune, and afford absolute securit y against the most imminent dangers by land and sea. Public odiu m was cast on those who refused to be initi ated. They were considered profane, unworthy of public employment or private confidence; and held to be doomed to eternal punishment as impious. To betra y the secrets of the Mysteries, to wear on the stage the dress of an Initiate, or to hold the Mysteries up to derision, was to incur death at the hands of public vengeance. It is certain that up to the time of Cicero, the Mysteries still retained much of their original character of sanctit y and purit y. And at a later day, as we kno w, Nero, after committing a horrible crime, did not dare, even in Greece, to aid in the celebration of the M ysteries; nor at a still later day was Constantine, the Christian Emperor, allowed to do so, after his murder of his relatives. Everywhere, and in all their forms, the Mysteries were funereal; and celebrated the mystical death and restoration to life of some divine or heroic personage: and the details of the legend and the mode of the death varied in the different Countries where the Mysteries were practised. Their explanation belongs both to astronom y and mythology; and the Legend of the Master's Degree is but another form of that of the M ysteries, reaching back, in one shape or other, to the remotest antiquit y. Page 270 of 621"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Whether Egypt originated the legend, or borrowed it from India or Chaldæa, it is now impossibl e to know. But the Hebrews received the Mysteries from the Egyptians; and of course were familiar with their legend , – known as it was to those Egyptian Initiates, Joseph and Mo ses. It was the fable (or rather the truth clothed in allegor y and figures) of OSIRIS, the Sun, Source of Light and Principle of Good, and TYPHO N, the Principle of Darkness and Evil. In all the histories of the Gods and Heroes la y couched and hidden astronom ical details and the history of the operations of visible Nature; and those in their turn were also s ymbols of higher and profounder truths. None but rude uncultivat ed intellects could long consider the Sun and Stars and the Powers of N ature as Divine, or as fit objects of Human Worship; and they will consider them so while the world lasts; and ever remain ignorant of the great Spiritual Truths of which these are the hierogl yphics and expressions. A brief summary of the Egyptian legend will serve to show the leading idea on which the Mysteries among the Hebrews were based. Osiris, said to have been an ancient King of Eg ypt, was the Sun; and Isis, his wife, the Moon: and his history recounts, in poetical and figurative style, the annual journey of the Great Lumin ary of Heaven through the different Signs of the Zodiac. In the absence of Osiris, Typhon, his brother, filled with envy and ma lice, sought to usurp his throne; but his plans were frustrated by Isis. Then he resolved to kill Osiris. This he did, by persuading him to enter a coffin or sarcophagus, which he then flung into the Nile. After a long search, Isis found the body, and concealed it in the depths of a forest; but Typhon, finding it there, cut it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them hither and thither. After tedious search, Isis found thirteen pieces, the fishes having eaten the other (the privates), which she replaced of wood, and buried the body at Philæ; where a te mple of surpassing magnif icence was erected in honor of Osiris. Isis, aided by her son O rus, Horu s or Har-oeri, warred against Typhon, slew him, reigned gloriousl y, and at her death was re-united to her husband, in the same tomb. Typhon was represented as born of the earth; the upper part of his bod y covered with feathers, in stature reaching the clouds, his arms and legs covered with scales, serpents darting from him on ever y side, and fire flashing from his mouth. Horus, w ho aided in slaying him, became the God of the Sun, answering to the Grecian Apollo; and Typhon is but the anagra m of Python, the great serpent slain by Apollo. The word Ty phon, like Eve, signifies a serpent , and life . 1 By its form the serpent symbolizes life, which circula tes through all nature. When, toward the end of autumn, the Woman (Virgo), in the constellat ions seems (upon the Chaldæan sphere) to crush with her heel the head of the serpent, this figure foretells the coming of winter, during which life seems to retire from all beings, and no longer to circulate through nature. This is why Typhon signifies also a serpent, the symbol of winter, which, in the Catholic Temples, is represented surrounding the Terrestrial Globe, which surmounts the heavenl y cross, emblem of redempt ion. If the word Ty phon is derived from Tupoul , it signifies a tree which produces apples ( mala , evils), the Jewish origin of the fall of man. Typhon means also one who supplants, and signifies the human passions, which expel from our hearts the Page 271 of 621"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike lessons of wisdom. In the Eg yptian Fable, Isis wrote the sacred word for the instruction of men, and Typhon effaced it as fast as she wrote it. In morals, his name signifies Pride , Ignorance , and Falsehood . When Isis first found the bod y, where it had floated ashore near B yblos, a shrub of erica or tamarisk near it had, by the virtue of the body, shot up into a tree around it, and protected it; and hence our sprig of acacia. Isis was also aided in her search b y Anubis, in the shape of a dog. H e was Sirius or the Dog-Star, the friend and counsellor of Osiris, and the inventor of language, grammar, astrono my, survey ing, arithmetic, music, and medica l science; the first maker of laws; and who taught the worship of the Gods, and the building of Temples. In the Mysteries, the nailing up of the bod y of Osiris in the chest or ark wa s termed the aphanism , or disappearance [of the Sun at the Winter Solstice, below the Tropic of Capricorn], and the recover y of the different parts of his body by Isis, the Euresis , or finding. The candidate went through a ceremony representing this, in all the Mysteries everywhere. The main facts in the fable were the same in all countries; and the promin ent Deities were ever ywhere a male and a fema le. In Egypt they were Osiris and Isis: in India, Mahadeva and Bhavani: in Phœnicia, Thammuz (or Adonis) and Astarte: in Phry gia, Atys and Cybele: in Persia, Mithras and Asis: in Samothr ace and Greece, Dionusos or Sabazeus and Rhea: in Britain, Hu and Ceridwen: and in Scandinavia, Woden and Frea: and in ever y instance these Divinities represented the Sun and the Moon. The mysteries of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, seem to have been the model of all other ceremonies of initiation subsequentl y established among the different peoples of the world. Those of Atys and Cybele, celebrat ed in Phrygia; those of Ceres and Pro serpine, at Eleusis and many other places in Greece, were but copies of the m. This we learn from Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, Lactan tius, and other writers; and in the absence of direct testimony should necessaril y infer it from the sim ilarity of the adventures of these Deities; for the ancients held that the Ceres of the Greeks was the same as the Isis of the Eg yptians; and Dionusos or Bacchus as O siris. In the legend of Osiris and Isis, as given by Plutarch, are man y details and circu mstances other than those that we have briefl y mentioned; and all of which we need not repeat here. Osiris marri ed his sister Isis; and labored publicl y with her to ameliorate the lot of men. He taught them agriculture, while Isis invented laws. He built temples to the Gods, and established their worship. Both were the patrons of artists and their useful inventions; and introduced the use of iron for defensive weapons and imp lements of agriculture, and of gold to adorn the temples of the Gods. He went forth with an arm y to conquer men to civilization, teaching the people whom he overca me to plant the vine and sow grain for food. Typhon, his brother, slew him when the sun was in the sign of the Scorpion, that is to say, at the Autumn al Equinox. They had been rival claimants, says Synesius, for the throne of Egypt, as Light and Darkness contend ever for the empire of the world. Plutarch adds, that Page 272 of 621"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike at the time when Osiris was slain, the moon was at its full; and therefore it was in the sign opposite the Scorpion, that is, the Bull, the sign of the Vernal Equinox. Plutarch assures u s that it was to represent these events and details that Isis established the Mysteries, in which they were re-produced by images, symbols, and a religious ceremonial, whereby they were im itated: and in which lessons of piet y were given, and consolations under the misfortunes that afflict us here below. Those who instituted these Mysteries meant to strengthen religion and console men in their sorrows by the loft y hopes found in a religious faith, whose principles were represented to them covered by a pompous ceremonial, and under the sacred veil of allegor y. Diodorus speaks of the famous columns erected near N ysa, in Arabia, where, it was said, were two of the tombs of Osiris and Isis. On one wa s this inscription: \"I am Isis, Queen of this country . I was instructed by Mercury . No one can destroy the laws which I have established. I am the eldest daughter of Saturn, most ancient of the Gods. I am the wife and sister of Osiris the King. I first made known to morta ls the use of wheat. I am the mother of Orus the King. In m y honor w as the city of Bubaste built. Rejoice, O Egypt, rejoice, land that gave me birth!\"... And on the other was this: \"I am Osiris the King, who led my armies into all parts of the world, to the most thickly inhabited countries of India, the North, the Danube, and the Ocean. I am the eldest son of Saturn: I was born of the brilliant and magnifi cent egg, and m y substance is of the same nature as that which composes light. There is no place in the Universe where I have not appeared, to bestow m y benefits and make known m y discoveries.\" The rest was illegib le. To aid her in the search for the bod y of Osiris, and to nurse her infant child Horus, Isis sought out and took with her Anubis, son of Osiris, and his sister Nephte. He, as we have said, was Sirius, the brightest star in the Heavens. After finding him, she went to Byblos, and seated herself near a fountain, where she had learned that the sacred chest had stopped which contained the body of Osiris. There she sat, sad and silent, shedding a torrent of tears. Thither came the women of the Court of Queen Astarte, and she spoke to them, and dressed their hair, pouring upon it deliciousl y perfumed ambrosia. This known to the Queen, Isis was engaged as nurse for her child, in the palace, one of the columns of which was made of the erica or tamarisk, that had grown up over the chest containing Osiris, cut down by the King, and unkno wn to him, still enclosing the chest: which column Isis afterward demand ed, and from it extract ed the chest and the body, which, the latter wrapped in thin draper y and perfum ed, she carried away with her. Blue Masonry, ignorant of its import, still retains among its emblems one of a woman weeping over a broken column, holding in her hand a branch of acacia, myrtle, or tamar isk, while Time, we are told, stands behind her combing out the ringlets of her hair. We need not repeat the vapid and trivial explanation there given, of this representation of Isis , weeping at Byblos, over the colu mn torn from the palace of the King, that contained the body of Osiris, while Horus, the God of Ti me, pours ambrosia on her hair. Nothing of this recital was historical ; but the whole was an allegor y or sacred fable, containing a mean ing known only to those w ho were initiated into the Mysteries. All the incidents were astronomic al, with a mean ing still deeper lying behind that explanation, and so hidden by a double veil. The Mysteries, in which these incidents were represented and Page 273 of 621"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike explained, were like those of Eleusis in their object, of which Pausanias, who was initiated, says that the Greeks, from the remo test antiquit y, regarded them as the best calcula ted of all things to lead men to piety: and Aristotle says they were the most valuable of all religious institutions, and thus were called mysteries par excell ence; and the Temple of Eleusis was regarded as, in some sort, the com mon sanctuar y of the whole earth, where religion had brought together all that was most imposing and most august. The object of all the Mysteries was to inspire men with piet y, and to console the m in the miseries of life. That consolation, so afforded, was the hope of a happier future, and of passing, after death, to a state of eternal felicity. Cicero says that the Initiat es not onl y received lessons which made life more agreeable, but drew from the cere monies happy hopes for the mo ment of death. Socrates says that those who were so fortunate as to be ad mitted to the Mysteries, possessed, when dying, the most glorious hopes for eternit y. Aristides sa ys that they not only procure the Initiates consolations' in the present life, and me ans of deliverance from the great weight of their evils, but also the precious advantage of passing after death to a happier state. Isis was the Goddes s of Sais; and the famous Feast of Lights was celebrat ed there in her honor.' There were celebrated the Mysteries, in which were represented the death and subsequent restoration to life of the God Osiris, in a secret ceremony and scenic representation of his sufferings, called the Mysteries of Night. The Kings of Egy pt often exercised the functions of the Priest-hood; and the y were initiated into the sacred science as soon as they attained the throne. So at Athens, the First Magistrate, or Archon-King, superintended the Mysteries. This was an im age of the union that existed between the Priesthood and Roy alty, in those earl y times when legislators and kings sought in religion a potent politica l instrum ent. Herodotus sa ys, speaking of the reasons w hy animals were deified in Egypt: \"If I were to explain these reasons, I s hould be led to the disclosure of those hol y matters which I particul arly wish to avoid, and which, but from necessit y, I should not have discussed at all.\" So he sa ys, \"The Eg yptians have at Sais the tomb of a certain personage, whom I do not think m yself permitted to specif y. It is behind the Temple of Minerva.\" [The latter, so called by the Greeks, was reall y Isis, whose was the often- cited enigmatical inscription, \"I am what was and is and is to come. No morta l hath yet unveiled me.\"] So again he says: \"Upon this lake are represented by night the accidents which happened to him whom I dare not name. The Egyptians call them their Mysteries. Concerning these, at the same time that I confess m yself sufficient ly inform ed, I feel myself compel led to be silent. Of the ceremonies also in honor of Ceres, I ma y not venture to speak, further than the obligations of religion will allow me.\" It is easy to see what was the great object of initiation and the Mysteries; whose first and greatest fruit was, as all the ancients testify, to civili ze savage hordes, to soften their ferocious manners, to introduce among them social intercourse, and lead them into a way of life more worthy of men. Cicero considers the establishm ent of the Eleusinian Mysteries to be the greatest of all the benefits conferred by Athens on other com monwealths; their effects having been, he sa ys, to civili ze men, soften their savage and ferocious mann ers, Page 274 of 621"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and teach them the true principles of morals, which initiate man into the only kind of life worthy of him. The same philosophic orator, in a passage where he apostrophizes Ceres and Proserpine, says that mankind owes these Goddesse s the first ele ments of moral life, as well as the first means of sustenance of physical life; knowledge of the laws, regulation of morals, and those exa mples of civil ization which have improved the manners of men and cities. Bacchus in Euripides says to Pentheus, that leis new institution (the Dionysiac Mysteries) deserved to be known, and that one of its great advantages was, that it proscribed all impurity: that these were the Mysteries of Wisdom, of which it would be impruden t to speak to person s not initiated : that they were established among the Barbarians, who in that showed greater wisdom than the Greeks, who had not y et received them. This double object, politic al and religious, – one teaching our dut y to men, and the other what we owe to the Gods; or rather, respect for the God s calcul ated to main tain that which we owe the laws, is found in that well-known verse of Virgil, borrowed by him from the ceremonies of initiation : \"Teach me to respect justice and the Gods.\" This great lesson, which the Hierophant impressed on the Initiates, after the y had witnessed a representation of the Infernal regions, the Poet places after his description of the different punishmen ts suffered b y the wicked in Tartarus, and im mediately after the description of that of Sisyphus. Pausanias, likewise, at the close of the representation of the punishments of Sisyphus and the daughters of Danaus, in the Temple at Delphi, makes this reflection; that the crime or impiety which in the m had chiefly merited this punishment, was the contemp t which the y had shown for the M ysteries of Eleusis. From this reflection of Pausanias, who was an Initiate, it is easy to see that the Priests of Eleusis, who taught the dogma of punishmen t in Tartarus, included among the great crimes deserving these punishmen ts, contemp t for and disregard of the Hol y Mysteries; whose object was to lead men to piety, and thereb y to respect for justice and the laws, chief object of their institution, if not the only one, and to which the needs and interest of religion itself were subordinate; since the latter was but a means to lead more surely to the former; for the whole force of religious opinions being in the hands of the legislators to be wielded, they were sure of being better obeyed. The Mysteries were not merely simple lustrations and the observation of some arbitrar y formulas and cere monies; nor a means of reminding men of the ancient condition of the race prior to civiliza tion: but the y led men to piety by instruction in morals and as to a future life; which at a very early day, if not originall y, formed the chief portion of the ceremonial. Symbols were used in the cere monies, which referred to agriculture, as Masonry has preserved the ear of wheat in a symbol and in one of her words; but their principal reference was to astrono mical phenom ena. Much was no doubt said as to the condition of brutality and degradation in which man was sunk before the institution of the M ysteries; but the allusion was rather meta-physical, to the ignorance of the uninitia ted, than to the wild life of the earliest men. Page 275 of 621"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The great object of the M ysteries of Isis, and in general of all the Mysteries, was a great and truly politic one. It was to am eliorate our race, to perfect its manners and morals, and to restrain societ y by stronger bonds than those that human laws impose. They were the invention of that ancient science and wisdom which exhausted all its resources to make legislation perfect; and of that philosophy which has ever sought to secure the happiness of man, by purifying his soul from the passions which can trouble it, and as a necessary consequence introduce social disorder. And that they were the work of genius is evident from their employment of all the sciences, a profound kno wledge of the human heart, and the means of subduing it. It is a still greater mistak e to imagine that they were the inventions of charlatan ism, and means of deception. They may in the lapse of time have degenerated into imposture and schools of false ideas; but they were not so at the beginning; or else the wisest and best men of antiquit y have uttered the most willful falsehoods. In process of ti me the very allegori es of the M ysteries themselves, Tartarus and its punishments, Minos and the other judges of the dead, came to be misunderstood, and to be false because they were so; while at first the y were true, because the y were recognized as merely the arbitrar y forms in which truths were enveloped. The object of the Mysteries was to procure for man a real felicity on earth by the means of virtue; and to that end he was taught that his soul was imm ortal; and that error, sin, and vice must needs, by an inflexible law, produce their consequences. The rude representation of physical torture in Tartarus was but an i mage of the certain, unavoidable, eternal consequences that flow by the law of God's enactm ent from the sin co mmitted and the vice indulged in. The poets and mystagogues labored to propagate these doctrines of the soul's immortality and the certain punishmen t of sin and vice, and to accredit them with the people, by teaching them the former in their poems, and the latter in the sanctuaries; and they clothed them with the charms, the one of poetr y, and the other of spectacles and magic illusions. They painted, aided by all the resources of art, the virtuous man's happy life after death, and the horrors of the frightful prisons destined to punish the vicious. In the shades of the sanctuaries, these delights and horrors were exhibited as spectacles, and the Initiat es witnessed religious dramas, under the name of initiation and mysteries . Curiosit y was excited by secrecy , by the difficult y experienced in obtaining admission, and by the tests to be undergone. The candidate was amused by the variety of the scenery , the pomp of the decorations, the appliances of machinery. Respect was inspired by the gravit y and dignit y of the actors and the majest y of the ceremonial; and fear and hope, sadness and delight, were in turns excited. The Hierophants, men of intelle ct, and well understanding the disposition of the people and the art of controll ing them, used every applianc e to attain that object, and give import ance and impressiveness to their ceremonies. As they covered those cere monies with the veil of Secrecy, so they preferred that Night should cover them with its wings. Ob scurity adds to impressiveness, and assists illusion; and the y used it to produce an effect upon the astonished Initiate. The cere monies were conducted in caverns dimly lighted: thick groves Page 276 of 621"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike were planted around the Te mples, to produce that gloom that impresses the mind with a religious awe. The very word mystery , according to Deme trius Phalereus, was a me taphorical expression that denoted the secret awe which darkness and gloom inspired. The night was almost always the time fixed for their celebration ; and the y were ordinaril y termed nocturnal ceremonies. Initiations into the Mysteries of Samothrac e took place at night; as did those of Isis, of which Apuleius speaks. Euripides makes Bacchus sa y, that his My steries were celebrat ed at night, because there is in night something august and i mposing. Nothing excites men's curiosity so much as Mys tery, concealing things which they desire to know: and nothing so much increases curiosit y as obstacles that interpose to prevent them from indulging in the gratific ation of their desires. Of this the Legislators and Hierophants took advantage, to attract the people to their sanctuaries, and to induce them to seek to obtain lessons from which they would perhaps have turned away with indifference, if they had been pressed upon them. In this spirit of mystery they professed to imitate the Deity, who hides Himself from our sen ses, and conceals from us the springs by which He moves the Universe. The y admitted that they concealed the highest truths under the veil of allegory, the more to excite the curiosit y of men, and to urge the m to investigation. The secrecy, in which they buried their Mysteries, had that end. Those to whom they were confided, bound the mselves, by the most fearful oaths, never to reveal them. They were not allowed even to speak of these importan t secrets with any others than the initiated ; and the penalty of death was pronounced against any one indiscreet enough to reveal them, or found in the Temple without being an Initiat e; and any one who had betra yed those secrets, was avoided by all, as excomm unicated. Aristotle was accused of i mpiety, by the Hierophant Eur ymedon, for having sacrificed to the manes of his wife, according to the rite used in the worship of Ceres. He was compelled to flee to Chalcis; and to purge his mem ory from this stain, he directed, by his will, the erection of a Statue to that Goddess. S ocrates, dying, sacrificed to Esculapius, to exculpate himself from the suspicion of Atheism. A price was set on the head of Diagoras, because he had divulged the Secret of the M ysteries. Andocides was accused of the same crime, as was Alcibiades, and both were cited to answer the charge before the inquisition at Athens, where the People were the Judges. Æsch ylus the Tragedian was accused of having represented the Mysteries on the stage; and was acquitt ed only on proving that he had never been initia ted. Seneca, compar ing Philosophy to initiation, says that the most sacred ceremon ies could be known to the adepts alone: but that many of their precepts were known even to the Profane. Such was the case with the doctrine of a future life, and a state of rewards and punishmen ts beyond the grave. The ancient legislators clothed this doctrine, in the pomp of a mysterious ceremony, in mystic words and magi cal representations, to impress upon the mind the truths they taught, by the strong influence of such scenic displays upon the senses and imagin ation. In the same way they taught the origin of the soul, its fall to the earth past the spheres and through the elements, and its final return to the place of its origin, when, during the continuance of its union with earthl y matter, the sacred fire, which form ed its essence, had Page 277 of 621"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike contracted no stains, and its brightness had not been marred by foreign particles, which, denatural izing it, weighed it down and dela yed its return. These metaphysical ideas, with difficult y comprehend ed by the mass of the Initiat es, were represented by figures, b y symbols, and by allegorical analogies; no idea being so abstract that men do not seek to give it expression by, and translate it into, sensible images. The attraction of Secrec y was enhanced by the difficult y of obtaining admission. Obstacles and suspense redoubled curiosit y. Those who aspired to the initia tion of the Sun and in the Mysteries of Mithras in Persia, underwent many trials. They commenced by easy tests and arrived by degrees at those that were most cruel, in which the life of the candidate was often endangered. Gregory Nazianzen terms them tortures and mystic punish ments . No one can be initia ted, says Suidas, until after he has proven, b y the most terrible trials, that he possesses a virtuous soul, exemp t from the sway of every passion, and at it were impassible. There were twelve principal tests; and some make the number larger. The trials of the Eleusinian initiations were not so terrible; but the y were severe; and the suspense, above all, in which the aspirant was kept for several years [the memory of which is retained in Masonry by the ages of those of the different Degrees], or the interval between admission to the inferior and initiation in the great Mysteries, was a species of torture to the curiosit y which it was de sired to excite. Thus the Eg yptian Priests tried Pythagoras before admi tting him to know the secrets of the sacred science. He succeeded, by his incredibl e patience and the courage with which he surmounted all obstacles, in obtaining admission to their society and receiving their lessons. Among the Jews the Essenes adm itted none among them, until they had passed the tests or several Degrees. By initiation, those w ho before were fellow- citizens only, became brothers , connected by a closer bond than before, by means of a religious fraternit y, which, bringing men nearer together, united them more strongly : and the weak and the poor could more readily appeal for assistance to the powerful and the wealth y, with whom religious association gave them a closer fellowship. The Initiate was regarded as the favorite of the Gods. F or him alone Heaven opened its treasures. Fortunate during life, he could, by virtue and the favor of Heaven, promise himself after death an eternal felicity. The Priests of the Island of Samothrac e promised favorable winds and prosperous vo yages to those who w ere initiated. It was promised them that the CABIRI, and Castor and Pollux, the DIOSCURI, s hould appear to them when the storm raged, and give them calms and smooth seas: and the Scholiast of Aristophanes says that those initi ated in the Mysteries there were ju st men, who were privileged to escape from great evils and tempests. The Initiate in the Mysteries of Orpheus, after he was purified, was con sidered as released from the emp ire of evil, and transferred to a condition of life which gave him the happiest hopes. \"I have emerged from evil,\" he was made to say, \"and have attained good.\" Those initiated in the Mysteries of Eleusis believed that the Sun blazed with a pure splendor for them alone. And, as we s ee in the case of Pericles, they flattered themselves that Ceres and Proserpine inspired the m and gave them wisdom and counsel. Page 278 of 621"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Initiation dissipated errors and banished misfortune: and after having filled the heart of man with joy during life, it gave him the most blissful hopes at the moment of death. We owe it to the Goddesses of Eleusis, says Socrates, that we do not lead the wild life of the earliest men: and to the m are due the flatter ing hopes which initi ation gives us for the moment of death and for all eternity. The benefit which we reap from these august ceremonies, says Aristides, is not only present joy, a deliveranc e and enfranchise ment from the old ills; but also the sweet hope w hich we have in death of passing to a more fortunate state. And Theon sa ys that participat ion of the Mysteries is the finest of all things, and the source of the greatest blessings. The happiness promised there was not li mited to this mortal life; but it extended beyond the grave. There a new life was to com mence, during which the Initiate was to en joy a bliss without allo y and without li mit. The Cor ybantes promised eternal life to the Initiates of the M ysteries of Cybele and At ys. Apuleius represents Lucius, while still in the form of an ass, as addressing his pra yers to Isis, whom he speaks of as the same as Ceres, Venus, Diana, and Proserpine, and as illuminating the walls of man y cities simultaneousl y with her feminin e lustre, and substituting her quivering light for the bright rays of the Sun. She appears to him in his vision as a beautiful female, \"over who se divine neck her long thick hair hung in graceful ringlets.\" Addres sing him, she says, \"The parent of Universal nature attends thy call. The mistress of the Ele ments, initiativ e germ of generations, Supreme of Deities, Queen of departed spirits, first inhabitant of Heaven, and uniform type of all the Gods and Goddesse s, propitia ted by thy prayers, is with thee. She governs with her nod the luminous heights of the fir mament, the salubrious breezes of the ocean; the silent deplorable depths of the shades below; one Sole Divinit y under man y forms, worshipped by the different nations of the Earth under many titles, and with various religious rites.\" Directing him how to proceed, at her festival, to re-obtain his human shape, she say s: \"Throughout the entire course of the re mainder of thy life, until the very last breath has vanished from thy lips, thou art devoted to my service... Under m y protection will thy life be happy and glorious: and when, thy days being spent, thou shalt descend to the shades below, and inhabit the Elysian fields, there also, even in the subterranean hemisphere, shalt thou pay frequent worship to me, thy propitious patron: and yet further: if through sedulous obedience, religious devotion to my ministry, and inviolabl e chastity, thou shalt prove thyself a worthy object of divine favor, then shalt thou feel the influence of the power that I alone possess. The number of thy days shall be prolonged beyond the ordinary decrees of fate.\" In the procession of the festival, Lucius saw the image of the Goddess, on either side of which were female attendants, that, \"with ivory combs in their hands, made believe, by the motion of their arms and the twisting of their fingers, to co mb and ornam ent the Goddes s' royal hair.\" Afterward, clad in linen robes, came the initia ted, \"The hair of the women was moistened by perfume, and enveloped in a transparent covering; but the men, terrestrial stars, as it were, of the great religion, were thoroughly shaven, and their bald heads shone exceedingl y.\" Afterward ca me the Priests, in robes of white linen. The first bore a la mp in the form of a boat, emitting flame from an orifice in the middle : the second, a smal l altar: the third, a Page 279 of 621"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike golden palm-tree: and the fourth displa yed the figure of a left hand, the pal m open and expanded, \"representing thereby a symbol of equity and fair-dealing, of which the left hand, as slower than the right hand, and more void of skill and craft, is therefore an appropriate emblem.\" After Lucius had, b y the grace of Isis, recovered his human form, the Priest said to him, \"Calamity hath no hold on those whom our Goddess hath chosen for her service, and whom her majesty hath vindicat ed.\" And the people declared that he was fortunate to be \"thus after a mann er born again, and at once betrothed to the service of the Holy Ministry .\" When he urged the Chief Priest to initia te him, he was ans wered that there was not \"a single one among the initia ted, of a mind so depraved, or so bent on his own destruction, as, without receiving a special command from Isis, to dare to undertake her min is-try rashly and sacrilegiousl y, and thereb y commit an act certain to bring upon himself a dreadful injury.\" \"For,\" continued the Chief Priest, \"the gates of the shades below, and the care of our life being in the hands of the Goddes s, – the ceremony of initiation into the Mysteries is , as it were, to suffer death , with the precarious chance of resuscitation. Wherefore the Godde ss, in the wisdom of her Divinit y, hath been accusto med to select as persons to whom the secrets of her religion can with propriety be entrusted, those w ho, standing as it were on the utmost limit of the course of life they have comp leted, may through her Providence be in a manner bo rn again , and com mence the career of a new existence.\" When he was finall y to be initi ated, he was conducted to the nearest baths, and after having bathed, the Priest first solicited forgiveness of the Gods, and then sprinkled him all over with the clearest and purest water, and conducted him back to the Temple; \"where,\" says Apuleius, \"after giving me some instruction, that mortal tongue is not perm itted to reveal, he bade me for the succeeding ten days restrain my appetite, eat no ani mal food, and drink no wine.\" These ten days elapsed, the Priest led him into the inmost recesses of the Sanctuar y. \"And here, studious reader,\" he continues, \"peradventure thou wilt be sufficientl y anxious to know all that was said and done, which, were it lawful to divulge, I would tell thee; and, wert thou permi tted to hear, thou shouldst know. N evertheless, although the disclosure would affix the penalt y of rash curiosity to my tongue as well as th y ears, yet will I, for fear thou shouldst be too long tormen ted with religious longing, and suffer the pain of protracted suspense, tell the truth notwithstanding. Listen then to what I shall relate. I approached the abode of death; with my foot I pressed the thre shold of Proserpine 's Palace. I was transpo rted through the elements, and conducted back again. At midnight I saw the bright light of the sun shining. I stood in the presence of the God s, the God s of Heaven and of the Shades below; ay, stood near and worshipped . And now have I told thee such things that, hearing, thou necessaril y canst not understand; and being beyond the comprehension of the Profane, I can enunciate without committing a crime.\" After night had passed, and the morning had dawned, the usual ceremonies were at an end. Then he was consecrated by twelve stoles being put upon him, clothed, crowned with palm-leaves, and exhibited to the people. The remainder of that day was celebrat ed as his birthday and passed in festivities; and on the third day afterward, the same religious Page 280 of 621"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike ceremonies were repeated, including a religious breakfast, \" followed by a final consummation of ceremonies .\" A year afterward, he was warned to prepare for initia tion into the Mysteries of \"the Great God, Supreme Parent of all the other Gods, the invincible OSIRIS.\" \"For,\" say s Apuleius, \"although there is a strict connexion between the religions of both Deities, AN D EVEN THE ESSENCE OF BOTH DI VINITIES IS IDENTICAL, the ceremon ies of the respective initiations are considerabl y different.\" Compar e with this hint the following language of the pra yer of Lucius, addressed to Isis; and we may judge what doctrines were taught in the Mysteries, in regard to the Deity: \"O Holy and Perpetual Preserver of the Human Race! ever ready to cherish mort als by Thy munificence, and to afford Th y sweet matern al affection to the wretched under misfortune; Whose bount y is never at rest, neither by day nor by night, nor throughout the ver y minutest particle of duration; Thou who stretchest forth Thy health- bearing right hand over the land and over the sea for the protection of mankind, to disperse the storms of life, to unravel the inextricabl e entangle ment of the web of fate, to mitigate the tempests of fortune, and restrain the malign ant influences of the stars, – the Gods in Heaven adore Thee, the God s in the shades below do T hee homage, the stars obey Thee, the Divinities rejoice in Thee, the elements and the revolving season s serve Thee! At Thy nod the winds breathe, clouds gather, seeds grow, buds germina te; in obedience to Thee the Earth revolves AND THE SU N GIVES U S LIGHT. IT IS THO U WHO GO VERNEST THE UNIVERSE AND TREADEST TARTARUS U NDER THY FEET.\" Then he was initiated into the nocturnal Mysteries of Osiris and Serapis: and afterward into those of Ceres at Rome : but of the cere monies in these initia tions, Apuleius sa ys nothing. Under the Archonship of Euclid, bastards and slaves were excluded from initiation; and the same exclusion obtained against the Materialists or Epicureans who denied Providence and consequentl y the utility of initiation. By a natural progress, it came at length to be considered that the gates of El ysium would open onl y for the Initiat es, whose souls had been purified and regenerated in the sanctuaries. But it was never held, on the other hand, that initiation alone sufficed. We learn from Plato, that it was also necessary for the soul to be purified from every stain: and that the purification necessary was such as gave virtue, truth, wisdom, strength, justice, and temp erance. Entrance to the Temples was forbidden to all who had com mitted homicide, even if it were involuntar y. So it is stated by both Isocrates and Theon. Magicians and Charlatans who made trickery a trade, and impostors pretending to be possessed by evil spirits, were excluded from the sanctuaries. Every impious person and criminal was rejected; and Lampridius states that before the celebrat ion of the Mysteries, public notice was given, that none need appl y to enter but those against whom their consciences uttered no reproach, and who were certain of their own innocence. It was required of the Initiate that his heart and hands should be free from any stain. Porphyry says that man's soul, at death, should be enfranchised from all the passions, from hate, envy, and the others; and, in a word, be as pure as it is required to be in the Mysteries . Of course it is not surprising that parricides and per jurers, and others who had Page 281 of 621"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike committed crimes against God or man, could not be admitted. In the Mysteries of Mithras, a lecture was repeated to the Initiate on the sub ject of Justice. And the great moral lesson of the Mysteries, to which all their m ystic ceremonial tended, expressed in a single line by Virgil, was to practise Justice and revere the Deity ; – thus recalling men to justice, by connecting it with the justice of the Gods, who require it and punish its infraction. The Initiate could aspire to the favors of the Gods, only because and while he respected the rights of society and those of humani ty. \"The sun,\" says the chorus of Initiates in Aristophanes, \"burns with a pure light for us alone, who, adm itted to the Mysteries, observe the laws of piet y in our intercourse with strangers and our fellow- citizens.\" The rewards of initia tion were attached to the practice of the social virtues. It was not enough to be initiated merely. It was necessary to be faithful to the laws of initiat ion, which imposed on men duties in regard to their kind. Bacchus allowed none to participat e in his M ysteries, but men who conformed to the rules of piet y and justice. Sensibilit y, above all, and compassion for the m isfortunes of others, were precious virtues, which initiation strove to encourage. \"Nature,\" says Juvenal, \"has created us compassionat e, since it has endowed us with tears. Sensibilit y is the most admirable of our senses. What m an is truly worthy of the torch of the M ysteries; who such as the Priest of Ceres requires him to be, if he regards the misfortun es of others as wholly foreign to himse lf?\" All who had not used their endeavors to defeat a conspirac y; and those who had on the contrary fomented one; those citizens who had betra yed their countr y, who had surrendered an advantageous post or place, or the vessels of the State, to the enemy; all who had supplied the ene my with money; and in general, all who had come short of their duties as honest men and good citizens, were excluded from the Mysteries of Eleusis. To be admitted there, one must have lived equitabl y, and with sufficient good fortune not to be regarded as hated by the Gods. Thus the Society of the Initiat es was, in its principle, and according to the true purpose of its institution, a society of virtuous men, who labored to free their souls from the tyranny of the passions, and to develop the ger m of all the social virtues. And this was the mean ing of the idea, afterward m isunderstood, that entry into El ysium was only allowed to the Initiates: because entrance to the sanctuaries was allowed to the virtuous only, and Elysium was created for virtuous souls alone. The precise nature and details of the doctrines as to a future life, and rewards and punishmen ts there, developed in the Mysteries, is in a m easure uncertain. Little direct information in regard to it has come down to us. No doubt, in the ceremonies, there was a scenic representation of Tartarus and the judgment of the dead, resembling that which we find in Virgil: but there is as little doubt that these representations were explained to be allegori cal. It is not our purpose here to repeat the descriptions given of El ysium and Tartarus. That would be aside from our object. We are onl y concerned with the great fact that the Mysteries taught the doctrine of the soul' s immortality, and that, in some shape, suffering, pain, remorse, and agony , ever follow sin as its consequences. Human ceremoni es are indeed but imperfec t symbols; and the alterna te baptisms in fire and water intended to purify us into im mortality, are ever in this world interrupted at the Page 282 of 621"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike moment of their anticip ated comple tion. Life is a mirror which reflects only to deceive, a tissue perpetuall y interrupted and broken, an urn forever fed, y et never full. All initiation is but introductor y to the great change of death. Baptism, anointing, embalming, obsequies b y burial or fire, are preparator y symbols, like the initiation of Hercules before descending to the Shades, pointing out the mental change which ought to precede the renewal of existence. Death is the true initiation, to which sleep is the introductor y or minor mystery. It is the final rite which united the Egyptian with his God, and which opens the same promise to all who are duly prepared for it. The body was deemed a prison for the soul; but the latter was not condemn ed to eternal banishm ent and imprison ment. The Father of the Worlds perm its its chains to be broken, and has provided in the course of Nature the me ans of its escape. It was a doctrine of immemorial antiquit y, shared alike by Egyptians, Pythagoreans, the Orphici, and by that character istic Bacchic Sage, \"the Preceptor of the Soul,\" Silenus, that death is far better than life; that the real death belongs to those who on earth are immersed in the Lethe of its passions and fascinations, and that the true life commences only when the soul is emancipated for its return. And in this sense, as presiding over life and death, Dionusos is in the highest sense the LIBERATOR: since, like Osiris, he frees the soul, and guides it in its migra tions beyond the grave, preserving it from the risk of again falling under the slaver y of matter or of some inferior animal form, the purgatory of Mete mpsychosis; and exalting and perfecting its nature through the purifying discipline of his M ysteries. \"The great consumm ation of all philosoph y,\" said Socrates, professedl y quoting from traditional and mystic sources, \"is Death : He who pur sues philosoph y aright, is studying how to die .\" All soul is part of the Universal Soul, whose totalit y is Dionuso s; and it is therefore he who, as Spirit of Spirits, leads back the vagrant spirit to its home, and accompan ies it through the purif ying processes, both real and symbolical, of its earthl y transit. He is therefore emphatically the Mystes or Hierophant, the great Spiritual Mediator of Greek religion. The human soul is itself δαιμονιος a God within the mind, capable through its own power of rivalling the canoniza tion of the Hero, of making itself immortal by the practice of the good, and the conte mplation of the beautiful and true. The remova l to the Happ y Islands could only be understood mythically; everything earthly must die; Man, like Œdipus, is wounded from his birth, his real elysium can exist only beyond the grave. Dionusos died and descended to the shades. His pas sion was the great Secret of the Mysteries; as Death is the Grand My stery of existence. His death, typical of Nature's Death, or of her periodical decay and restoration, was one of the many symbols of the palingenesia or second birth of man. Man descended from the elemental Forces or Titans [Elohim ], who fed on the body of the Pantheistic Deity creating the Universe by self-sacrifice, commemorates in sacra mental observance this mysterious passion; and while partaking of the raw flesh of the victi m, seems to be invigorated by a fresh draught from the fountain of universal life, to receive a new pledge of regenerated existence. Death is the inseparable anteceden t of life; the seed Page 283 of 621"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike dies in order to produce the plant, and earth itself is rent asunder and dies at the birth of Dionusos. Hence the significanc y of the phallus , or of its inoffensive substitute, the obelisk, rising as an emb lem of resurrection by the tomb of buried Deity at Lerna or at Sais. Dionusos-O rpheus descended to the Shades to recover the lost Virgin of the Zodiac, to bring back his moth er to the sky as Thy one; or what has the same meaning, to consum mate his eventful marriage with Persephone, thereb y securing, like the nuptials of his father with Semele or Danaë, the perpetuit y of Nature. His under-earth office is the depression of the year, the wintr y aspect in the alterna tions of bull and serpent, whose united series mak es up the continuit y of Time, and in which, physically speaking, the stern and dark are ever the parents of the beautiful and bright. It was this aspect, sombre for the mo ment, but bright b y anticip ation, which was contemplated in the Mysteries: the human sufferer was consoled b y witnessing the severer trials of the Gods; and the vicissitudes of life and death, expressed b y apposite symbols, such as the sacrifice or submersion of the Bull, the extinction and re-illu mination of the torch, excited corresponding emotions of alternate grief and joy, that play of passion which was present at the origin of Nature, and which acco mpanies all her changes. The greater Eleusiniæ were celebra ted in the month Boëdromion, when the seed was buried in the ground, and when the year, verging to its decline, disposes the mind to serious reflection. The first day s of the cere monial were passed in sorrow and anxious silence, in fasting and expiator y or lustral offices. On a sudden, the scene was changed: sorrow and lam entation were discarded, the glad nam e of Iacchus passed from mouth to mouth, the image of the God, crowned with m yrtle and bearing a lighted torch, was borne in joyful procession from the Cera micus to Eleusis, where, during the ensuing night, the initiation was comp leted by an imposing revelation. The first scene was in the προναο ς, or outer court of the sacred enclosure, where am idst utter darkness, or while the med itating God, the star illum inating the Nocturnal Mystery, alone carried an unextinguished torch, the candidates were overawed with terrific sounds and noises, wh ile they painfull y groped their way, as in the gloomy cavern of the soul's sublunar m igration; a scene ju stly compared to the passage of the Valley of the Shadow of Death. For by the immutable law exemplified in the trials of Psyche, man must pass through the terrors of the under- world, before he can reach the height of Heaven. At length the gates of the adytum were thrown open, a supernatural light streamed from the illuminated statue of the Goddess, and enchanting sights and sound s, ming led with song s and dances, exalted the communicant to a rapture of supreme felicity, realizing, as far as sensuous imager y could depict, the anticipated reunion with the God s. In the dearth of direct evidence as to the detail of the cere monies enacted, or of the meanings connected with them, their tendenc y must be inferred from the characterist ics of the contem plated deities with their accessory symbols and mythi, or from direct testimon y as to the value of the Mysteries generall y. The ordinary phenomena of vegetation, the death of the seed in giving birth to the plant, connecting the sublim est hopes with the plainest occurrences, was the simpl e yet beautiful formula assumed by the great mystery in almost all religions, from the Zend- Avesta to the Page 284 of 621"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Gospel. As P roserpina, the d ivine power is as the seed decaying and destroyed; as Artemis, she is the principle of its destruction; but Artemis Proserpina is also Cor Soteria, the ē Saviour, who leads the Spirits of Hercules and Hyacinthus to Heaven. Many other emblems were emp loyed in the Mysteries, – as the dove, the myrtle-wreath, and others, all significant of life rising out of death, and of the equivocal condition of dying yet immortal man. The horrors and punishments of Tartarus, as described in the Phædo and the Æ neid, with all the ceremon ies of the judgments of Mino s, Eacus, and Rhadam anthus, were represented, sometimes more and somet imes less full y, in the Mysteries; in order to impress upon the minds of the Initiates this great lesson, – that we should be ever. prepared to appear before the Suprem e Judge, with a heart pure and spotless; as Socrates teaches in the Gorgias. For the soul stained with cri mes, he says, to descend to the Shades, is the bitterest ill. To adhere to Justice and Wisdom, Plato holds, is our dut y, that we ma y some day take that lofty road that leads toward the heavens, and avoid most of the evils to which the soul is exposed in its subterranean journey of a thousand ye ars. And so in the Phædo, Socrates teaches that we should seek here below to free our soul of its passions, in order to be ready to enter our appearance, whenever Destiny summons us to the Shades. Thus the Mysteries inculcat ed a great moral truth, veiled with a fable of huge proportions and the appliances of an impressive spectacle, to which, exhibited in the sanctuaries, art and natural magic lent all they had that was imposing. They sought to strengthen m en against the horrors of death and the fearful idea of utter annihilation. Death, sa ys the author of the dialogue, entitled Axiochus , included in the works of Plato, is but a passage to a happier state; but one must have lived well, to attain that most fortunate result. So that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul was consoling to the virtuous and religious man alone; while to all others it came with menaces and despair, surrounding the m with terrors and alarms that disturbed their repose during all their life. For the material horrors of Tartarus, allegoric al to the Initia te, were real to the mass of the Profane; nor in latter times, did, perhaps man y Initiates read rightly the allegor y. The triple-walled prison, which the conde mned soul first met, round w hich swelled and surged the fiery waves of Phlegethon, wherein rolled roaring, huge, blazing rocks; the great gate with columns of adamant, which none save the Gods could crush; Tisiphone, their warder, with her bloody robes; the lash resounding on the mang led bodies of the miserab le unfortunates, their plaintive groans, mingl ed in horrid harmon y with the clashings of their chains; the Furies, lashing the guilty with their snakes; the awful ab yss where Hydra howls with its hundred heads, greed y to devour; Tityus, prostrate, and his entrails fed upon by the cruel vulture; Sisyphus, ever rolling his rock; Ixion on his wheel; Tantalus tortured by eternal thirst and hunger, in the midst of water and with delicious fruits touching his head; the daughters of Danaus at their eternal, fruitless task; beasts biting and venomous reptiles stinging; and devouring fla me eternal ly consuming bodies ever renewed in endless agon y; all these sternly impressed upon the people the terrible consequences of sin and vice, and urged them to pursue the paths of hone sty and virtue. And if, in the cere monies of the M ysteries, these material horrors w ere explained to the Initiates as mere symbols of the unim aginabl e torture, remorse, and agony that would rend Page 285 of 621"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the immaterial soul and rack the immortal spirit, they were feeble and insufficient in the same mode and measure only, as all material images and symbols fall short of that which is beyond the cognizance of our sen ses: and the grave Hierophant, the imagery, the paintings, the dramatic horrors, the funeral sacrifices, the august mysteries, the solemn silence of the sanctuaries, were none the less impr essive, because they were known to be but symbols, that with material shows and imag es made the imagination to be the teacher of the intell ect. So, too, it was represented, that except for the gravest sins there was an opportunit y for expiation ; and the tests of water , air , and fire were represented; by means of which, during the march of man y years, the soul could be purified, and rise toward the ethereal regions; that ascent being more or less tedious and laborious, according as each soul was more or less clogged by the gross imped iments of its sins and vices. Herein was shadowed forth, (how distinctl y taught the Initiates we know not), the doctrine that pain and sorro w, misfortun e and remorse, are the inevitabl e consequences that flow from sin and vice, as effect flows from cause; that by each sin and ever y act of vice the soul drops back and loses ground in its advance toward perfection: and that the ground s o lost is and will be in reality never so recovered as that the sin shall be as if it never had been com mitted; but that throughout all the eternit y of its existence, each soul shall be conscious that every act of vice or baseness it did on earth has made the distance greater between itself and ulti mate perfection. We see this truth glimmering in the doctrine, taught in the Mysteries, that though slight and ordinar y offences could be expiated by penances, repentance, acts of beneficenc e, and prayers, grave crimes were morta l sins, bey ond the reach of all such rem edies. Eleusis closed her gates against Nero: and the Pagan Priests told Constantine that among all their modes of expiation there was none so potent as could wash from his soul the dark spots left by the murder of his wife, and his mult iplied perjuries and assas sinations. The object of the ancient initiations being to ame liorate mankind and to perfect the intellectual part of man, the nature of the hum an soul, its origin, its destination, its relations to the bod y and to universal nature, all formed part of the m ystic science; and to them in part the lessons given to the Initiate were directed. For it was believed that initiation tended to his perfection, and to preventing the divine part within him, overloaded with matter gross and earth y, from being plunged into gloom, and impeded in its return to the Deit y. The soul, with the m, was not a mer e conception or abstraction ; but a realit y including in itself life and thought; or, rather, of whose es sence it was to live and think. It was material; but not brute, inert, inactiv e, lifeless, motionless, formless, lightless matter. It was held to be active, reasoning, thinking; its natural home in the highest regions of the Universe, whence it descended to illuminate, give form and move ment to, vivif y, animate, and carry with itself the baser ma tter; and whither it unceasingl y tends to reascend, when and as soon as it can free itself from its connection with that matter. From that substance, divine, infinitely delicat e and active, essentially luminous, the souls of men were formed, and by it alone, uniting with and organizing their bodies, men lived . This was the doctrine of Pythagoras, who learned it when he received the Egyptian Mysteries: and it was the doctrine of all who, by means of the ceremon ial of initiation, thought to purif y the soul. Virgil makes the spirit of Anchises teach it to Æneas: and all the Page 286 of 621"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike expiations and lustrations used in the M ysteries were but s ymbols of those intell ectual ones by which the soul was to be purged of its vice- spots and stains, and freed of the incumbrance of its earthl y prison, so that it might rise unimped ed to the source from which it came. Hence sprung the doctrine of the transmigra tion of souls; which Pythagoras taught as an allegory, and those who came after him received literally. Plato, like him, drew his doctrines from the East and the M ysteries, and undertook to translate the language of the symbols used there, into that of Philosoph y; and to prove by argumen t and philosophical deduction, what, felt by the consciousness, the M ysteries taught by symbols as an indisputable fact, – the im mortality of the soul. Cicero did the same; and followed the Mysteries in teaching that the Gods were but mortal men, who for their great virtues and signal services had deserved that their souls should, after death, be raised to that lofty rank. It being taught in the Mysteries, either by way of allegor y, the meaning of which was not made known except to a select few, or, perhaps only at a later day, as an actual reality, that the souls of the vicious dead passed into the bodies of those anima ls to whose nature their vices had most affinity, it was also taught that the soul could avoid these transm igrations, often successive and num erous, by the practice of virtue, which would acquit it of them, free it from the circle of successive generations, and restore it at once to its source. Hence nothing was so ardentl y prayed for by the Initia tes, says Proclus, as this happy fortune, which, delivering them from the empire of Evil, would restore them to their true life, and conduct them to the place of final rest. To this doctrine probabl y referred those figures of animals and monsters which were exhibited to the Initiate, before allowing him to see the sacred light for which he sighed. Plato says, that souls will not reach the term of their ills, until the revolutions of the world have restored the m to their pri mitive condition, and purified them from the stains which they have contract ed by the contagion of fire, earth, and air. And he held that the y could not be allowed to enter Heaven, until they had distinguished themse lves by the practice of virtue in some one of three several bodies. The Manicheans allowed five: Pindar, the same number as Plato; as did the Jews. And Cicero says, that the ancient soothsay ers, and the interpreters of the will of the Gods, in their religious cere monies and initiat ions, taught that we expiate here below the cri mes committed in a prior life; and for that are born. It was taught in these Mysteries, that the soul passes through several states, and that the pains and sorrows of this life are an expiation of prior faults. This doctrine of transmigra tion of souls obtained, as Porph yry informs us, among the Persians and Magi. It was held in the East and the West, and that from the remo test antiquit y. Herodotus found it a mong the Egyptians, who mad e the term of the circle of migrations from one human body, through anim als, fishes, and birds, to another human body, three thousand y ears. Empedoc les even held that souls went into plants. Of these, the laurel was the noblest, as of ani mals the lion; both being consecrated to the Sun, to which, it was held in the Orient, virtuous souls were to return. The Curds, the Chinese, the Kabbalists, all held the same doctrine. So Origen held, and the Bishop Sy nesius, the latter of whom had been initiat ed, and who thus pra yed to God: \"O Father, grant that my soul, Page 287 of 621"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike reunited to the light, may not be plunged again into the defile ments of earth!\" So the Gnostics held; and even the Disciples of Christ inquired if the man who was born blind, was not so punished for some sin that he had comm itted before his birth. Virgil, in the celebrated allegor y in which he develops the doctrines taught in the Mysteries, enunciat ed the doctrine, held by most of the ancient philosophers, of the pre- existence of souls, in the eternal fire from which they emanate; that fire which ani mates the stars, and circula tes in ever y part of Nature: and the purificat ions of the soul, b y fire, water, and air, of which he speaks, and which three modes were emp loyed in the Mysteries of Bacchus, were sy mbols of the passage of the soul into different bodies. The relations of the human soul with the rest of nature were a chief object of the science of the Mysteries. The man was there brought face to face with entire nature. The world, and the spherical envelope that surround s it, were represented by a mystic egg, by the side of the image of the Sun-God who se Mysteries were celebrated. The famous Orphic egg was consecrated to Bacchus in his Mys teries. It was, say s Plutarch, an image of the Universe, which engenders every thing, and contains everything in its bosom. \"Consult,\" sa ys Macrobius, \"the Initiates of the M ysteries of Bacchus, who honor with special veneration the sacred egg.\" The rounded and almost spherical form of its shell, he says, which encloses it on ever y side, and confines within itself the principles of life, is a symbolic image of the world; and the world is the universal principle of all things. This symbol was borro wed from the Egyptians, who also consecrated the egg to Osiris, germ of Light, himself born, say s Diodorus, from that famous egg. In Thebes, in Upper Egypt, he was represented as emit ting it from his mouth, and causing to issue from it the first principle of heat and light, or the Fire-God, V ulcan, or Phtha. We find this egg even in Japan, between the horns of the famous Mithriac Bull, whose attributes Osiris, Apis, and Bacchus all borrowed. Orpheus, author of the Grecian Mysteries, which he carried from Egypt to Greece, consecrated this symbol: and taught that matter, uncreated and informous, existed from all eternity, unorganized, as chaos; containing in itself the Principles of all Existences confused and intermingled, light with darkness, the dry with the humid, heat with cold; from which, it after long ages taking the shape of an imm ense egg, issued the purest matter, or first sub stance, and the residue was divided into the four elem ents, from which proceeded heaven and earth and all things else. This grand Cosmogon ic idea he taught in the Mysteries; and thus the Hierophant explained the meaning of the mystic egg, seen b y the Initiates in the Sanctuar y. Thus entire Nature, in her primitive organizat ion, was presented to him whom it was wished to instruct in her secrets and initiate in her m ysteries; and Clem ens of Alexandria might well say that initiation was a real physiology. So Phanes, the Light-God, in the Mysteries of the New Orphics, em erged from the egg of chaos: and the Persians had the great egg of Ormuzd. And Sanchoniathon tells us that in the Phœnician theolog y, the matter of chaos took the form of an egg; and he adds: \"Such are the lessons which the Son of Thabion, first Hierophant of the Phœnicians, turned into allegori es, in which ph ysics and astrono my intermingled, and which he taught to the other Page 288 of 621"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Hierophants, whose dut y it was to preside at orgies and initiat ions; and who, seeking to excite the astonishm ent and admira tion of mortals, faithful ly transmi tted these things to their successors and the Initia tes.\" In the Mysteries was also taught the division of the Universal Cause into an Active and a Passive cause; of which two, Osiris and Isis, – the heavens and the earth were symbols. These two First Causes, into which it was held that the great Universal First Cause at the beginning of things divided itself, were the two great Divinities, whose w orship was, according to Varro, inculcated upon the Initiat es at Samothr ace. \"As is taught,\" he says, \"in the initiation into the Mysteries at Samothr ace, Heaven and Earth are regarded as the two first Divinities. They are the potent Gods w orshipped in that Island, and whose names are consecrated in the books of our Augur s. One of the m is male and the other female; and they bear the same relation to each other as the soul does to the body, humidi ty to dryness.\" The Curetes, in Crete, had builded an altar to heaven and to Earth; whose Mysteries they celebrat ed at Gnossus, in a cypress grove. These two Divinities, the Active and Passive Principles of the Universe, were co mmonly symbolized by the generative parts of man and woman; to which, in remo te ages, no idea of indecenc y was attached ; the Phallus and Cteis , emblems of generation and production, and which, as such, appeared in the Mysteries. The Indian Lingam was the union of both, as were the boat and mast and the point within a circle: all of which expressed the same philosophical idea as to the Union of the two great Causes of Nature, which concur, one actively and the other passivel y, in the generation of all beings: which were symbolized by what we now ter m Gemini, the Twins, at that remote period when the Sun was in that Sign at the Vernal Equinox, and when they were Male and Fema le; and of which the Phallus was perhaps taken from the generative organ of the Bull, when about twent y-five hundred years before our era he opened that equinox, and becam e to the Ancient World the symbol of the creative and generative Power. The Initiates at Eleusis commenced, Proclus sa ys, by invoking the two great causes of nature, the Heavens and the Earth, on which in succession the y fixed their eyes, addressing to each a prayer. And they deemed it their duty to do so, he adds, because the y saw in them the Father and Mother of all generations. The concourse of these two agents of the Universe was term ed in theological language a marriage . Tertull ian, accusing the Valentini ans of having borrowed these symbols from the Mysteries of Eleusis, y et admits that in those My steries they were explained in a manner consistent with decenc y, as representing the powers of nature. He was too littl e of a philosopher to compr ehend the sublime esoteric meaning of these emblems, which will, if you advance, in other Degrees be unfolded to y ou. The Christian Fathers contented themselves with reviling and ridiculing the use of these emblems. But as they in the earlier times created no indecent ideas, and were worn alike by the most innocent youths and virtuous women, it will be far wiser for us to seek to penetrate their meaning. Not onl y the Egyptians, says Diodorus Siculus, but every other people that consecrate this symbol (the Phallus), deem that they thereby do honor to the Active Force of the universal generation of all living things. For the same reason, as we learn from the geographer Ptolem y, it was revered among the Assyrians and Persians. Page 289 of 621"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Proclus rem arks that in the distribution of the Zodiac among the twelve great Divinities, by ancient astrology , six signs were assigned to the ma le and six to the female principle. There is another division of nature, which has in all ages struck all men, and which was not forgotten in the Mysteries; that of Light and Darknes s, Day and Night, Good and Evil; which mingle with, and clash against, and pursue or are pursued b y each other throughout the Universe. The Great Symbolic Egg distinct ly remind ed the Initiates of this great division of the world. Plutarch, treating of the dogma of a Providence, and of that of the two principles of Light and Darknes s, which he regarded as the basis of the Ancient Theolog y, of the Orgies and the Mysteries, as well among the Greeks as the Barbarians, – a doctrine whose origin, according to him, is lost in the night of time, – cites, in support of his opinion, the famous Mystic Egg of the disciples of Zoroaster and the Initia tes in the Mysteries of Mithras. To the Initiat es in the Mysteries of Eleusis was exhibited the spectacle of these two principles, in the successive scenes of Darknes s and Light which passed before their eyes. To the profoundest darkness, acco mpanied with illusions and horrid phantoms, succeeded the most brillian t light, whose splendor blazed round the statue of the Goddes s. The candidate, says Dion Chry sostomus, passed into a mysterious temple, of astonishing magnitude and beaut y, where were exhibited to him many mystic scenes; where his ears were stunned with man y voices; and where Darknes s and Light successivel y passed before him. And Themist ius in like manner describes the Initiate, when about to enter into that part of the sanctuar y tenanted by the Goddes s, as filled with fear and religious awe, wavering, uncertain in what direction to advance through the profound darknes s that envelopes him. But when the Hierophant has opened the entrance to the inmost sanctuar y, and removed the robe that hides the Goddes s, he exhibits her to the Initiate, resplendent with divine light. The thick shadow and gloom y atmosphere which had environed the candidate vanish; he is filled with a vivid and glowing enthusiasm, that lifts his soul out of the profound de jection in which it was plunged; and the purest light succeeds to the thickest darkness. In a fragment of the same writer, preserved by Stobæus, w e learn that the Initiate, up to the moment when his initi ation is to be consum mated, is alarm ed by every kind of sight: that astonishm ent and terror take his soul captive; he trembles; cold sweat flows from his bod y; until the moment when the Light is shown him, – a most astounding Light, – the brillian t scene of Elysium, where he sees charm ing meadows overarched by a clear sky, and festivals celebrat ed by dances; where he hears harmon ious voices, and the majesti c chants of the Hierophants; and views the sacred spectacles. Then, absolutel y free, and enfranchised from the domin ion of all ills, he ming les with the crowd of Initiates, and, crowned with flowers, celebrates with them the hol y orgies, in the brilliant realms of ether, and the dwelling- place of Ormuzd. In the Mysteries of Isis, the candidate first passed through the dark valle y of the shadow of death; then into a place representing the elements or sublunary world, where the two principles clash and contend; and was finally admitted to a luminous region, where the sun, with his most brilliant light, put to rout the shades of night. Then he himself put on the costume of the Sun-God, or the Visible Source of Ethereal Light, in whose M ysteries he Page 290 of 621"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike was initiat ed; and passed from the emp ire of darknes s to that of light. After having set his feet on the threshold of the palace of Pluto, he ascended to the E mpyrean, to the bosom of the Eternal Principle of Light of the Universe, from which all souls and intelligen ces emanate. Plutarch admits that this theor y of two Principles was the basis of all the Mysteries, and consecrated in the religious ceremonies and My steries of Greece. Osiris and Typhon, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Bacchus and the Titans and Giants, all represented these principles. Phanes, the luminous God that issued from the Sacred Egg, and Night, bore the sceptres in the Mysteries of the New Bacchus. Night and Da y were two of the eight Gods adored in the Mysteries of Osiris. The so journ of Proserpine and also of Adonis, during six months of each year in the upper world, abode of light, and six mon ths in the lower or abode of darkness, allegoric ally represented the same division of the Universe. The connection of the different initiations with the Equinoxes which separate the Emp ire of the Nights from that of the Days, and fix the mo ment when one of these principles begins to prevail over the other, show s that the Mysteries referred to the continual contest between the two principles of light and darkness, each alternatel y victor and vanquished. The very object proposed b y them shows that their basis wa s the theory of the two principles and their relations with the soul. \"We celebrat e the august My steries of Ceres and Proserpine,\" says the Emperor Julian, \"at the Autumnal Equinox, to obtain of the Gods that the soul may not experience the malignant action of the Power of Darkness that is then about to have sway and rule in Nature.\" Sallust the Philosopher makes almost the same remark as to the relations of the soul with the periodical march of light and darkness, during an annual revolution; and assures us that the mysterious festivals of Greece related to the same. And in all the explanations given b y Macrobius of the Sacred Fables in regard to the Sun, adored under the nam es of Osiris, Horus, A donis, At ys, Bacchus, etc., we invariabl y see that they refer to the theory of the two Principles, Light and Darkness, and the triumphs gained b y one over the other. In April was celebrated the first triumph obtained by the light of day over the length of the nights; and the cere monies of mourn ing and rejoicing had, Macrobius sa ys, as their object, the vicissitudes of the annual administration of the world. This brings u s naturall y to the tragic portion of these religious scenes, and to the allegoric al history of the different adventures of the Principle, Light, victor and vanquished by turns, in the comb ats waged with Darkness during each annual period. Here we reach the most mysterious part of the ancient initiations, and that most interesting to the Mason who laments the death of his Grand Ma ster Khir-Om. Over it Herodotus throws the august veil of mystery and silence. Speaking of the Te mple of Minerva, or of that Isis who wa s styled the Mother of the Sun-God, and whose My steries were ter med Isiac , at Sais, he speaks of a Tomb in the Temple, in the rear of the Chapel and against the wall; and say s, \"It is the tomb of a man, whose nam e respect requires m e to conceal. Within the Temple were great obelisks of stone [ phalli ], and a circular lake paved with stones and revetted with a parapet. It seemed to me as large as that at Delos\" [where the Mysteries of Apollo were celebrated]. \"In this lake the Egyptians celebrate, during the night, what they style the Mysteries, in which are represented the sufferings of the God of w hom I have spoken above.\" This God Page 291 of 621"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike was Osiris, put to death by Typhon, and who descended to the Shades and was restored to life; of which he had spoken before. We are rem inded, by this passage, of the To mb of Khir-Om, his death, and his rising from the grave, s ymbolical of restoration of life; and also of the brazen Sea in the Temple at Jerusalem . Herodotus adds: \"I impose upon m yself a profound silence in regard to these Mysteries, with most of which I am acquainted. As little will I speak of the initia tions of Ceres, known among the Greeks as Thesmophori a. What I shall say will not violate the respect which I owe to religion.\" Athenagoras quotes this passage to show that not onl y the Statue but the Tomb of Osiris was exhibited in Egypt, and a tragic representation of his s ufferings; and rem arks that the Egyptians had mourn ing ceremonies in honor of their Gods, who se deaths the y lamented; and to whom they afterward, sacrificed as having passed to a state of immortality. It is, however, not difficult, combining the different rays of light that emanat e from the different Sanctuaries, to learn the genius and the object of these secret ceremon ies. We have hints, and not details. We know that the Egyptians worshipped the Sun, under the name of Osiris. The misfortun es and tragical death of this God were an allegor y relating to the Sun. Typhon, like Ahriman, represented Darknes s. The sufferings and death of Osiris in the M ysteries of the Night were a mystic image of the phenom ena of Nature, and the conflict of the two great Principles which share the empire of Nature, and most influenced our souls. The Sun is neither born, dies, nor is raised to life: and the recital of these events was but an allegor y, veiling a higher truth. Horus, s on of Isis, and the same as Apollo or the Sun, also died and was re stored again to life and to his mother ; and the priests of Isis celebrated these great events by mourning and joyous festival succeeding each other. In the Mysteries of Phœnicia, established in honor of Tham muz or Adoni, also the Sun, the spectacle of his death and resurrection was exhibited to the Initiates. As we learn from Meursius and Plutarch, a figure was exhibited representing the corpse of a y oung man. Flowers were strewed upon his bod y, the women mourned for him; a tomb was erected to him. And these feasts, as we learn from Plutarch and Ovid, passed into Greece. In the Mysteries of Mithras, the Sun-God, in Asia Minor, A rmenia and Persia, the death of that God wa s lamented, and his resurrection was celebrat ed with the most enthusiastic expressions of joy . A corpse, we learn from Julian Firmicus, was shown the Initiates, representing Mithras dead; and afterward his resurrection was announced; and the y were then invited to rejoice that the dead God w as restored to life, and had b y means of his sufferings secured their salvation. Three months before, his birth had been celebrated, under the emb lem of an infant, born on the 25th of December, or the eighth day before the Kalends of Januar y. In Greece, in the Mysteries of the same God, honored under the name of Bakchos, a representation was given of his death, slain by the Titans; of his descent into hell, his subsequent resurrection, and his return toward his Principle or the pure abode whence he Page 292 of 621"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike had descended to unite hi mself with matter. In the islands of Chios and Tenedos, his death was represented by the sacrifice of a man, actuall y immolated. The mutilation and sufferings of the same Sun-God, honored in Phr ygia under the name of Atys, caused the tragic scenes that were, as we learn from Diodorus Siculus, represented annuall y in the Mysteries of Cybele, mother of the Gods. An imag e was borne there, representing the corpse of a y oung man, over whose tomb tears were shed, and to whom funeral honors were paid. At Samothr ace, in the Mysteries of the Cabiri or great Gods, a representation was given of the death of one of them. This nam e was given to the Sun, because the Ancient Astronomers gave the nam e of God s Cabiri and of Samothrac e to the two God s in the Constellat ion Gemin i; whom others term Apollo and Hercules, two names of the Sun. Athenion says that the young Cabirus so slain was the same as the Dionusos or Bakchos of the Greeks. The Pelasgi, ancient inhabitan ts of Greece, and who settled Samothrace, celebrat ed these Mysteries, whose origin is unknown: and the y worshipped Castor and Pollux as patrons of navigation. The tomb of Apollo was at Delphi, where his body was laid, after Python, the Polar Serpent that annuall y heralds the coming of autumn, cold, darkness, and winter, had slain him, and over whom the God triumphs, on the 25th of March, on his return to the lamb of the Vernal Equinox. In Crete, Jupiter Ammon, or the Sun in Aries, painted with the attributes of that equinoctia l sign, the Ram or Lamb; – that Ammon who, Martianus Copella says, is the same as Osiris, Adoni, Adonis, Aty s, and the other Sun-Gods, – had also a tomb, and a religious initiation; one of the principal ceremon ies of which consisted in clothing the Initiate with the skin of a white lamb. And in this we see the origin of the apron of white sheep-skin, used in Masonry . All these deaths and resurrections, these funeral emblems, these anniversaries of mourning and joy, these cenotaphs raised in different places to the Sun-God, honored under different names, had but a single object, the allegorica l narration of the events which happened here below to the Light of Nature, that sacred fire from which our souls were dee med to emanate, warring with Matter and the dark Principle resident therein, ever at variance with the Principle of Good and Light poured upon itself by the Supreme Divinit y. All these Mysteries, says Clemens of Alexandria, displaying to us murders and tombs alone, all these religious tragedies, had a com mon basis, variousl y ornament ed: and that basis w as the fictitious death and resurrection of the Sun, Soul of the World, principle of life and movement in the Sublunar y World, and source of our intellig ences, which are but a portion of the Eternal Light blazing in that Star, their chief centre. It was in the Sun that Souls, it was said, were purified: and to it they repaired. It was one of the gates of the soul, through which the theologians, says Porphy ry, say that it re-ascends toward the home of Light and the Good. Wherefore, in the Mysteries of Eleusis, the Dadoukos (the first officer after the Hierophant, who represented the Grand Demiourgos or Maker of the Universe), who wa s posted in the interior of the Te mple, and there received the candidates, represented the Sun. Page 293 of 621"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike It was also held that the vicissitudes experienced by the Father of Light had an influence on the destiny of souls; which, of the same substance as he, shared his fortunes. This we learn from the Emp eror Julian and Sallust the Philosopher. They are afflicted when he suffers: they rejoice when he triu mphs over the Power of Darkne ss which opposes his s way and hinders the happiness of Souls, to whom nothing is so terrible as darkness. The fruit of the sufferings of the God, father of light and Souls, slain by the Chief of the Powers of Darkness, and again restored to life, was received in the M ysteries. \"His death works your Salvation;\" said the High P riest of Mithras. That was the great secret of this religious tragedy, and its expected fruit; – the resurrection of a God, w ho, reposses sing Himself of His dominion over Darkness, s hould associate with Him in His triumph those virtuous Souls that by their purity were worthy to share His glory ; and that strove not against the divine force that drew them to Him, when He had thus conquered. To the Initiat e were also displa yed the spectacles of the chief agents of the Universal Cause, and of the distribution of the world, in the detail of its parts arranged in most regular order. The Universe itself supplied man with the mode l of the first Temp le reared to the Divinit y. The arrangem ent of the Temple of Solomon, the symbolic ornaments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the High Priest, – all, as Clemens of Alexandria, Josephus and Philo state, had reference to the order of the world. Cle mens informs us that the Temple contained many emblems of the Seasons, the Sun, the Moon, the planets, the constella tions Ursa Major and Minor, the zodiac, the elements, and the other parts of the world. Josephus, in his description of the High P riest's Vestmen ts, protesting against the charge of impiety brought against the Hebrews by other nations, for conte mning the Heathen Divinities, declares it false, because, in the construction of the Tabernacle, in the vestmen ts of the Sacrificers, and in the Sacred vessels, the whole World was in some sort represented. Of the three parts, he says, into which the Temple was divided, two represent Earth and Sea, open to all men, and the third, Heaven, God's dwelling- place, reserved for Him alone. The twelve loaves of Shew-bread signif y the twelve months of the year. The Candlestick represented the twelve signs through which the Seven Planets run their courses; and the seven lights, those planets; the veils, of four colors, the four elemen ts; the tunic of the High Priest, the earth; the Hyacinth, nearly blue, the Heavens; the ephod, of four colors, the whole of nature; the gold, Light; the breast-plate, in the midd le, this earth in the centre of the world; the two Sardony xes, used as clasps, the Sun and Moon; and the twelve precious stones of the breast-plate arranged by threes, like the Seasons, the twelve months, and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Even the loaves were arranged in two groups of six, like the zodiacal signs above and below the Equator. Clemens, the learned Bishop of Alexandria, and Philo, adopt all these explanations. Hermes calls the Zodiac, the Great Tent, – Tabernaculu m. In the Royal Arch Degree of the American Rite, the Tabernacle has four veils, of different colors, to each of which belongs a banner. The colors of the four are White, Blue, Crimson, and Purple, and the banners bear the images of the Bull, the Lion, the Man, and the Eagle, the Constellations answering 2500 years before our era to the Equinocti al and Solstitial points: to which belong four stars, Aldebarán, Regulus, Fomalh aut, and Antares. At each of these veils there are three words: and to each division of the Zodiac, belonging to each of these Stars, are three Signs. Page 294 of 621"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The four signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, were term ed the fixed signs, and are appropriate ly assigned to the four veils. So the Cherubim, according to Clem ens and Philo, represented the two hemispher es their wings, the rapid course of the firmament, and of tim e which revolves in the Zodiac. \"For the Heavens fly ;\" says Philo, speaking of the wings of the Cherubim : which were winged representations of the Lion, the Bull, the Eagle, and the Man; of two of which, the human- headed, winged bulls and lions, so man y have been found at Nimroud; adopted as beneficent symbols, when the Sun entered Taurus at the Vernal Equinox and Leo at the Summer Solstice: and when, also, he entered Scorpio, for which, on account of its malignant influences, Aquilla, the eagle was substituted, at the autu mnal equinox; and Aquarius (the water-bearer) at the Winter Solstice. So, Clem ens says, the candlestick with seven branches represented the seven planets, like which the seven branches were arranged and regulated, preserving that musical proportion and system of harmon y of which the sun wa s the centre and connection. They were arranged, says Philo, by threes, like the planets above and those below the sun; between which two group s was the branch that represented him, the mediator or moderator of the celestia l harmon y. He is, in fact, the fourth in the musical scale, as Philo remarks, and Martianus Capella in his hymn to the Sun. Near the candlestick were other e mblems representing the heavens, earth, and the vegetative matter out of who se bosom the vapors arise. The whole temple was an abridged image of the world. There were candlesticks with four branches, s ymbols of the elements and the seasons; with twelve, symbols of the signs; and even with three hundred and sixt y, the number of days in the year, without the supplemen tary days. Imitating the famous Temple of Tyre, where were the great columns consecrated to the winds and fire, the Tyrian artist placed two colu mns of bronze at the entrance of the porch of the te mple. The hemispherica l brazen sea, supported b y four groups of bulls, of three each, looking to the four cardinal points of the compass, represented the bull of the Vernal Equinox, and at Tyre were consecrated to Astarte; to whom Hiram, Josephus say s, had builded a temple, and who wore on her head a helmet bearing the image of a bull. And the throne of Solomon, with bulls adorning its arms, and supported on lions, like those of Horus in Egypt and of the Sun at T yre; likewise referred to the Vernal Equinox and Summ er Solstice. Those who in Thrace adored the sun, under the nam e of Saba-Zeus, the Grecian Bakchos, builded to him, says Macrobius, a te mple on Mount Zelmisso, its round form representing the world and the sun. A circular aperture in the roof ad mitted the light, and introduced the image of the sun into the body of the sanctuar y, where he seemed to blaze as in the heights of Heaven, and to dissipate the darkness within that temple which was a representative symbol of the world. There the passion, death, and resurrection of Bakchos were represented. So the Temple of Eleusis was lighted by a windo w in the roof. The sanctuar y so lighted, Dion comp ares to the Universe, from which he says it differed in size alone; and in it the great lights of nature played a great part and were mystically represented. The images of the Sun, M oon, and Mercury were represented there, (the latter the same as Anubis who Page 295 of 621"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike accompanied Isis); and the y are still the three lights of a Ma sonic Lodge; except that for Mercur y, the Master of the Lodge has been absurdly substituted. Eusebius names as the principal Ministers in the Mysteries of Eleusis, first, the Hierophant , clothed with the attributes of the Grand Architect (Demiourgos) of the Universe. After him came the Dadoukos , or torch-bearer, representativ e of the Sun: then the altar-bearer, representing the Moon: and last, the Hieroceryx , bearing the caduceus, and representing Mercur y. It was not permissible to reveal the different emblems and the mysterious pageantr y of initiat ion to the Profane; and therefore we do not know the attributes, emblems, and ornam ents of these and other officers; of which Apuleius and Pausanias dared not speak. We know only that everything recounted there was marvellous; everything done there tended to astonish the Initiat e: and that eyes and ears were equall y astounded. The Hierophant, of lofty height, and noble features, with long hair, of a great age, grave and dignified, with a voice sweet and sonorous, sat upon a throne, clad in a long trailing robe; as the Motive-God of Nature was held to be enveloped in His work and hidden under a veil which no mortal can raise. Even His name was conceal ed, like that of the Dem iourgos, whose name was ineffable. The Dadouko s also wore a long robe, his hair long, and a bandeau on his forehead. Callias, when holding that office, fighting on the great day of Marathon, clothed with the insignia of his office, was taken by the Barbarians to be a King. The Dadoukos led the procession of the Initiates, and was charged with the purifications. We do not know the functions of the Epibomos or assistant at the altar, who represented the moon. That planet was one of the two homes of souls, and one of the two great gates b y which they descended and reascended. Mercury was charged with the conducting of souls through the two great gates; and in going from the sun to the moon they passed immediately by him. He admit ted or rejected them as they were more or less pure, and therefore the Hierocer yx or Sacred Herald, who represented Mercur y, was charged with the duty of excluding the Profane from the Mysteries. The same officers are found in the procession of Initia tes of Isis, described b y Apuleius. All clad in robes of w hite linen, drawn tight across the breast, .and close- fitting down to the very feet, came, first, one bearing a lamp in the shape of a boat; second, one carr ying an altar; and third, one carr ying a golden palm-tree and the caduceus. These are the same as the three officers at Eleusis, after the Hierophant. Then .one carr ying an open hand, and pouring milk on the ground from a golden vessel in the shape of a woman's breast. The hand was that of justice: and the m ilk alluded to the Galax y or Milky Way, along which souls descended and remount ed. Two others followed, one bearing a winnowing fan, and the other a water-vase; symbols of the purificat ion of souls by air and water; and the third purificat ion, by earth, was represented by an image of the animal that cultivat es it, the cow or ox, borne by another officer. Then followed a chest or ark, m agnificently ornamen ted, containing an imag e of the organs of generation of Osiris, or perhaps of both sexes; embl ems of the original generating and producing Powers. When Typhon, said the Egyptian fable, cut up the bod y of Osiris into Page 296 of 621"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike pieces, he flung his genitals into the Nile, where a fish devoured them. Atys mutilated himself, as his Priests afterward did in imitation of him; and Adonis wa s in that part of his body wounded b y the boar: all of which represented the loss by the Sun of his vivif ying and generative power, when he reached the Autumnal Equinox (the Scorpion that on old monuments bites those parts of the Vernal Bull), and descended toward the region of darkness and Winter. Then, says Apuleius, came \"one who carried in his bosom an object that rejoiced the heart of the bearer, a venerable effigy of the Supreme Deity, neither bearing resemblanc e to man, cattle, bird, beast, or an y living creature: an exquisite invention, venerable from the novel originalit y of the fashioning; a wonderful, ineffable symbol of religious m ysteries, to be looked upon in profound silence. Such as it was, its figure was that of a smal l urn of burnished gold, hollowed ver y artistical ly, rounded at the bottom, and covered all over the outside with the wonderful hierogl yphics of the Egyptians. The spout was not elevated, but extended laterally, projecting like a long rivulet ; while on the opposite side was the handle, which, with simil ar lateral extension, bore on its summ it an asp, curling its body into folds, and stretching upward, its wrinkled, scaly, swollen throat.\" The salient basilisk, or royal ensign of the Pharaohs, often occurs on the monu ments – a serpent in folds, with his head raised erect above the folds. The basilisk was the Phœnix of the serpent-tribe; and the vase or urn wa s probabl y the vessel, shaped like a cucumber, with a projecting spout, out of which, on the monum ents of Egypt, the priests are represented pouring streams of the crux ansata or Tau Cross, and of sceptres , over the kings. In the Mysteries of Mithras, a sacred cave, representing the whole arrangemen t of the world, was used for the reception of the Initiat es. Zoroaster, says Eubulus, first introduced this custom of consecrating caves. The y were also consecrated, in Crete, to Jupiter; in Arcadia, to the Moon and Pan; and in the Island of Naxo s, to Bacchus. The Persians, in the cave where the Mysteries of Mithras were celebra ted, fixed the seat of that God, Father of Generation, or Demiourgos, near the equinoctial point of Spring, with the Northern portion of the world on his right, and the Southern on his left. Mithras, says Porphy ry, presided over the Equinoxes, seated on a Bull, the symbolical animal of the Demiourgos, and bearing a sword. The equinoxes were the gates through which souls passed to and fro, between the hemispher e of light and that or darkness. The milky way was also represented, passing near each of these gates: and it was, in the old theolog y, termed the pathway of souls. It is, according to Pythagoras, vast troops of souls that form that luminous belt. The route followed by souls, according to Porphy ry, or rather their progres sive march in the world, ly ing through the fixed stars and planets, the Mithriac cave not only displayed the zodiacal and other constella tions, and mark ed gates at the four equinoctial and solstitial points of the zodiac, whereat souls enter into and escape from the world of generations; and through which the y pass to and fro between the real ms of light and darkness; but it represented the seven planetar y spheres which they needs must traverse, in descending from the heaven of the fixed stars to the elements that envelop the earth; and seven gates were m arked, one for each planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning. Page 297 of 621"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike We learn this from Celsus, in Origen; who say s that the symbolical image of this pas sage among the Stars, used in the Mithriac Mysteries, was a ladder, reaching from earth to Heaven, divided into seven steps or stages, to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth, that of the fixed stars. The first gate, says Celsus, wa s that of Saturn, and of lead, by the heavy nature whereof his dull slow progres s was sy mbolized. The second, of tin, was that of Venu s, symbolizing her soft splendor and eas y flexibilit y. The third, of brass, was that of Jupiter, emblem of his solidit y and dry nature. The fourth, of iron, was that of Mercur y, expressing his indefatigable activity and sagacit y. The fifth, of copper, was that of Mars, expressive of his inequali ties and variable nature. The sixth, of silver, was that of the Moon: and the seventh, of gold, that of the Sun. This order is not the real order of these Planets; but a mysterious one, like that of the days of the Week consecrated to them, commencing with Saturda y, and retrograding to Sunday. It was dictated, Celsus sa ys, by certain harmonic relations, those of the fourth. Thus there was an intim ate connection between the Sacred Science of the Mysteries, and ancient astronom y and physics; and the grand spectacle of the Sanctuaries was that of the order of the Kno wn Universe, or the spectacle of Nature itself, surrounding the soul of the Initiate, as it surrounded it when it first descended through the planetar y gates, and by the equinocta l and solstitial doors, along the Milky Way, to be for the first time immured in its prison-house of ma tter. But the Mysteries also represented to the candidate, by sensible symbols, the invisible forces which move this visible Universe, and the virtues, qualities, and powers attached to matter, and which ma intain the marvel lous order observed therein. Of this Porph yry informs us. The world, according to the philosophers of antiquit y, was not a purely material and mechanical machine. A great Soul, diffused every where, vivified all the me mbers of the immense body of the Universe; and an Intelligen ce, equally great, directed all its movements, and maintained the eternal harmon y that resulted therefro m. Thus the Unity of the Universe, represented by the symbolic egg, contained in itself two units, the Soul and the Intelligenc e, which pervaded all its parts: and the y were to the Universe, considered as an animated and intelligen t being, what intellig ence and the soul of life are to the individual ity of man. The doctrine of the Unity of God, in this sense, was taught by Orpheus. Of this his h ymn or palinode is a proof; fragmen ts of which are quoted b y many of the Fathers, as Justin, Tatian, Clemens of Alexandria, Cyril, and Theodoret, and the whole by Eusebius, quoting from Aristobulus. The doctrine of the LOGOS (word) or the NO OS (intelle ct), his incarnat ion, death, resurrection or transfiguration; of his union with m atter, his division in the visible world, which he pervades, his return to the original Unity, and the whole theory relative to the origin of the soul and its destiny , were taught in the Mysteries, of which they were the great object. The Emperor Julian explains the Mysteries of Atys and Cy bele by the same metaph ysical principles, respecting the dem iurgical Intellig ence, its descent into ma tter, and its return to its origin: and extends this explanation to those of Ceres. And so likewise does Sallust the Philosopher, who adm its in God a secondar y intellig ent Force, which descends into the generative matter to organize it. These m ystical ideas naturall y formed a part of the sacred Page 298 of 621"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike doctrine and of the cere monies of initiation, the object of which, Sallust remarks, was to unite man with the World and the Deit y; and the final term of perfection whereof was, according to Clemens, the conte mplation of nature, of real beings, and of causes. The definition of Sallust is correct. The M ysteries were practised as a means of perfecting the soul, of mak ing it to know its own dignit y, of remind ing it of its noble origin and immortality, and consequentl y of its relations with the Universe and the Deity. What was meant by real beings, was invisible beings, genii , the faculties or powers of nature; everything not a part of the visible world, which was called, by way of opposition, apparent existence. The theory of Genii, or Powers of Nature, and its Forces, personified, made part of the Sacred Science of initiat ion, and of that religious spectacle of different beings exhibited in the Sanctuar y. It resulted from that belief in the providence and superintendence of the Gods, w hich was one of the pri mary bases of initia tion. The administration of the Universe b y Subaltern Genii, to whom it is confided, and by whom good and evil are dispensed in the world, was a consequence of this dogma, taught in the Mysteries of Mithras, where was shown that famous egg, shared between Ormuzd and Ahriman, each of whom commissioned twenty -four Genii to dispense the good and evil found therein; they being under twelve Superior Gods, six on the side of Light and Good, and six on that of Darkness and Evil. This doctrine of the Genii, depositaries of the Universal Providence, was intim ately connected with the Ancient Mysteries, and adopted in the sacrifices and initiat ions both of Greeks and Barbarians. Plutarch says that the God s, by means of Genii, who are intermediates between the m and men, draw near to morta ls in the ceremon ies of initiat ion, at which the Gods charge them to assist, and to distribute punishment and blessing. Thus not the Deit y, but His minist ers, or a Principle and Power of Evil, were dee med the authors of vice and sin and suffering: and thus the Genii or angels differed in character like men, some being good and some evil; some Celestial Gods, Archangels, Angels, and some Infernal Gods, Demons and fallen Angels. At the head of the latter was their Chief, Typhon, Ahriman, or Shaitan, the Evil Principle; who, having wrought disorder in nature, brought troubles on men by land and sea, and caused the greatest ills, is at last punished for his cri mes. It was these events and incidents, says Plutarch, which Isis desired to represent in the cere monial of the Mysteries, established by her in memory of her sorro ws and wanderings, whereof she exhibited an image and representation in her Sanctuaries, where also were afforded encourage ments to piety and consolation in misfortune. The dogm a of a Providence, he says, administering the Universe b y means of interm ediary Powers, who maint ain the connection of man with the Divinit y, was consecrated in the Mysteries of the Eg yptians, Phrygians, and Thracians, of the Magi and the Disciples of Zoroaster; as is plain b y their initiations, in which mournful and funereal ceremonies mingled. It was an essential part of the lessons given the Initiates, to teach them the relations of their own souls with Universal Nature, the greatest lessons of all, meant to dignif y man in his own ey es, and teach him his place in the Universe of things. Thus the whole s ystem of the Universe was display ed in all its parts to the eyes of the Initiate; and the symbolic cave which represented it was adorned and clothed with all the Page 299 of 621"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike attributes of that Universe. To this world so organized, endowed with a double force, active and passive, divided between light and darkness, moved by a living and intellig ent Force, governed b y Genii or Angels who preside over its different parts, and who se nature and character are more lofty or low in proportion as they possess a greater or less portion of dark matter, – to this world descends the soul, em anation of the ethereal fire, and exiled from the lum inous region above the world. It enters into this dark matter, wherein the hostile Principles, each seconded b y his troops of Genii, are ever in conflict, there to submit to one or more organizations in the bod y which is its prison, until it shall at last return to its place of origin, its true native country, from which during this life it is an exile. But one thing remained, – to represent its return, through the constellations and planetar y spheres, to its original home. The celestia l fire, the philosophers said, soul of the world and of fire, an universal principle, circula ting above the Heavens, in a region infinitel y pure and wholly luminous, itself pure, simple, and unmixed, is above the world by its specific lightness. If any part of it (sa y a human soul) descends, it acts against its nature in doing so, urged b y an inconsiderat e desire of the intell igence, a perfidious love for ma tter which causes it to descend, to know w hat passes here below, where good and evil are in conflict. The Soul, a simpl e substance, when unconnected with ma tter, a ray or particle of the Divine Fire, whose home is in Heaven, ever turns toward that home, while united with the body, and struggles to return thither. Teaching this, the Mysteries strove to recall man to his divine origin, and point out to him the means of returning thither. The great science acquired in the Mysteries was kno wledge of man's self, of the nobleness of his origin, the grandeur of his destiny , and his superiorit y over the ani mals, which can never acquire this knowledge, and whom he resembl es so long as he does not reflect upon his existence and sound the depths of his own nature. By doing and suffering, b y virtue and piet y and good deeds, the soul was enabled at length to free itself from the body, and ascend along the path of the Milky Way, by the gate of Capricorn and by the seven spheres, to the place whence b y many gradations and successive lapses and enthral ments it had descended. And thus the theory of the spheres, and of the signs and intellig ences which preside there, and the whole system of astronom y, were connected with that of the soul and its destin y; and so were taught in the Mysteries, in which were developed the great principles of physics and metaph ysics as to the origin of the soul, its condition here below, its destination, and its future fate. The Greeks fix the date of the establishm ent of the M ysteries of Eleusis at the year 1423 B. C., during the reign of Erechtheus at Athens. According to some authors, they were instituted by Ceres herself; and according to others, by that Monarch, who brought them from Egypt, where, according to Diodorus of Sicil y, he was born. Another tradition was, that Orpheus introduced them into Greece, together with the Dionisiac ceremonies, copying the latter from the Mysteries of Osiris, and the former from those of Isis. Nor was it at Athens only , that the worship and M ysteries of Isis, metamorphosed into Ceres, were established. The Bœotians worshipped the Great or Cabiric Ceres, in the recesses of a sacred grove, into which none but Initiates could enter; and the ceremon ies there observed, and the sacred traditions of their Mysteries, were connected with those of the Cabiri in Samothr ace.

Similar to these were the Mysteries of Bona Dea, the Good Goddes s, whose name, say Cicero and Plutarch, it was not permi tted to any man to know, celebrated at Rome from the earliest times of that city. It was these Mysteries, practised by women alone, the secrecy of which was impiously violated by Clodius. The y were held at the Kalends of May ; and, according to Plutarch, much of the ceremon ial greatly resembl ed that of the Mysteries of Bakchos. The Mysteries of Venus and Adonis belonged principal ly to Syria and Phœnicia, whence they passed into Greece and Sicil y. Venus or A starte was the Great Female Deity of the Phœnicians, as Hercules, Melkarth or Adoni was their Chief God. Adoni, called by the Greeks Adonis, wa s the lover of Venus. Slain by a wound in the thigh inflict ed by a wild boar in the chase, the flower called anemon e sprang from his blood. Venus received the corpse and obtained from Jupiter the boon that her lover should thereafter pass six mon ths of each year with her, and the other six in the Shades with Proserpine; an allegorical description of the alternat e residence of the Sun in the two hem ispheres. In these Mysteries his death was represented and mourned, and after this mac eration and mourning were concluded, his resurrection and ascent to Heaven were announced. Ezekiel speaks of the festivals of Adonis under the name of those of Tham muz, an Assyrian Deity, whom every year the women mourned, seated at the doors of their dwellings. These M ysteries, like the others, were celebra ted in the Spring, at the Vernal Equinox, when he was restored to life; at which time, when they were instituted, the Sun (ADON, Lord, or Master) was in the Sign Taurus, the domicile of Venu s. He was represented with horns, and the hymn of Orpheus in his honor st yles him \"the two-horned God;\" as in Argos Bakchos was represented with the feet of a bull. Plutarch says that Adonis and Bakchos were regarded as one and the same Deity; and that this opinion was founded on the great similar ity in very many respects between the Mysteries of these two God s. The Mysteries of Bakchos were known as the Sabazian, Orphic, and Dion ysiac Festivals. They went back to the remotest antiquit y among the Greeks, and were attributed by some to Bakchos himself, and by others to Orpheus. The resemblan ce in ceremon ial between the observances established in honor of Osiris in Eg ypt, and those in honor of Bakchos in Greece, the mythological traditions of the two Gods, and the symbols used in the festivals of each, amply prove their identity. Neither the name of Bakchos, nor the word orgies applied to his feasts, nor the sacred words used in his Mys teries, are Greek, but of foreign origin. Bakchos was an Oriental Deity, worshipped in the East, and his orgies celebrated there, long before the Greeks adopted them. In the earliest times he was wor shipped in India, Arabia, and Bactria. Page 301 of 621"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike He was honored in Greece with public festivals, and in simple or compli cated Mysteries, varying in cere monial in various places, as was natural, because his wor ship had come thither from different countries and at different periods. The people who celebrat ed the complicated Mysteries were ignorant of the m eaning of man y words w hich they used, and of many emblems which the y revered. In the Sabazian Feasts, for exa mple [from Saba- Zeus, an oriental name of this Deit y], the words EVOI, S ABOT, were used, which are in nowise Greek; and a serpent of gold was thrown into the bosom of the Initia te, in allusion to the fable that Jupiter had, in the form of a serpent, had connection with Proserpina, and begotten Bakchos, the bull; whence the enig matical saying, repeated to the Initiat es, that a bull engendered a dragon or serpent, and the serpent in turn engendered the bull, who became Bakchos: the meaning of which was, that the bull [Taurus, which then opened the Vernal Equinox, and the Sun in which Sign, figurativel y represented by the Sign itself, was Bakchos, Dionusos, Saba-Zeus, Osiris, etc.], and the Serpent, another constellat ion, occupied such relativ e positions in the Heavens, that when one rose the other set, and vice versa . The serpent was a fam iliar symbol in the Mysteries of Bakchos. The Initiat es grasped them with their hands, as Orphiucus does on the celestial globe, and the Orpheo-telestes, or purifier of candidates did the same, crying, as Demosthen es taunted Æschin es with doing in public at the head of the women whom his mother was to imi tate, EVOI, S ABOI, H YES ATTÊ, ATTÊ, HYES! The Initiates in these M ysteries had preserved the ritual and cere monies that accorded with the simplicity of the earliest ages, and the manners of the first men. The rules of Pythagoras were followed there. Like the Egyptians, who held wool unclean, they buried no Initiat e in woolen garments. They abstained from bloody sacrifices; and lived on fruits or vegetables or inanim ate things. The y imitated the life of the contem plative Sects of the Orient; thus approxi mating to the tranquilit y of the first ashen, who lived exempt from trouble and cri mes in the bosom of a profound peace. One of the most precious advantages promised by their initiation was, to put a man in communion with the Gods, by purifying his soul of all the passions that interfere with that enjoyment, and dim the rays of divine light that are communicated to ever y soul capable of receiving them, and that imitate their purity. One of the degrees of initiat ion was the state of inspiration to which the adepts were claimed to attain. The Initia tes in the Mysteries of the Lamb, at Pepuza, in Phry gia, professed to be inspired, and prophe sied; and it was claim ed that the soul, b y, means of these religious ceremon ies, purified of all stain, could see the Gods in this life, and certainly, in all cases, after death. The sacred gates of the Te mple, where the ceremon ies of initiat ion were perform ed, were opened but once in each year, and no stranger was ever allowed to enter it. Night threw her veil over these august M ysteries, which could be revealed to no one. There the sufferings of Bakchos were represented, who, like Osiris, died, descended to hell and rose to life again; and raw flesh wa s distributed to the Initiates, which each ate, in memory of the death of the Deity, torn in pieces by the Titans. Page 302 of 621"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike These Mysteries also were celebra ted at the Vernal Equinox; and the emblem of generation, to express the active energy and generative power of the Divinit y, was a principal symbol. The Initiates wore garlands and crown s of myrtle and laurel. In these Mysteries, the aspirant was kept in terror and darkness to perform the three days and nights; and was then made Αφαυισμος, or cere mony representing the death of Bakchos, the same mythological personage with Osiris. This was effected by confining him in a close cell, that he might seriousl y reflect, in solitude and darknes s, on the business he was engaged in: and his mind be prepared for the reception of the sublime and mysterious truths of prim itive revelation and philosoph y . This was a symbolic death; the deliveranc e from it, regeneration ; after which he was called διφυης or twin- born. While confined in the cell, the pursuit of Typhon after the mangled body of Osiris, and the search of Rhea or Isis for the same, were enacted in his hearing; the initia ted crying aloud the names of that Deity derived from the Sanscrit. Then it was announced that the body was found; and the aspirant was liberated amid shouts of joy and exultation. Then he passed through a representation of Hell and Elysium. \"Then,\" said an ancient writer, \"they are entertained with hymns and dances, with the sublime doctrines of sacred knowledge, and with wonderful and holy visions. And now become perfect and initiat ed, they are FREE, and no longer under restraint; but, crowned and triu mphant, they walk up and down the regions of the blessed, converse with pure and hol y men, and celebrat e the sacred Mysteries at pleasure.\" They were taught the nature and objects of the Mysteries, and the means of making themselves known, and received the name of Epopts ; were full y instructed in the nature and attribu tes of the Divinit y, and the doctrine of a future state; and made acquainted with the unity and attributes of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and the true meaning of the fables in regard to the Gods of Paganism: the great Truth being often proclaim ed, that \"Zeus is the pri mitive Source of all things; there is ONE God; ONE power, and ONE rule over all.\" And after full explanation of the man y symbols and emblems that surrounded the m, they were dismissed with the barbarous words Κ ογξ and Ομπαξ, corruptions of the Sanscrit words, Kansha Aom Pakscha ; meaning, object of our wishes , God , Silence , or Worship the Deity in Silence . Among the emblems used was the rod of Bakchos; which once, it was said, he cast on the ground, and it became a serpent; and at another time he struck the rivers Orontes and Hydaspes with it, and the waters receded and he passed over dr y-shod. Water was obtained, during the cere monies, by striking a rock with it. The Bakchæ crowned their heads with serpents, carried them in vases and baske ts, and at the Ευρησις or finding, of the body of Osiris, cast one, alive, into the aspirant's bo som. The Mysteries of Atys in Phry gia, and those of Cy bele his mistress, like their worship, much resembled those of Adonis and Bakchos, Osiris and Isis. Their Asiatic origin is universall y admitted, and was with great plausibili ty claimed by Phrygia, which contested the palm of antiquit y with Egypt. They, more than an y other people, mingled allegor y with their religious worship, and were great inventors of fables; and their sacred traditions as to Cybele and At ys, whom all admit to be Phry gian Gods, were very various. In all, as we learn from Julius Firm icus, they represented by allegor y the pheno mena of nature, and the succession of ph ysical facts, under the veil of a marvel lous history . Page 303 of 621"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Their feasts occurred at the equinoxes, commencing with lam entation, mourning, groans, and pitiful cries for the death of Atys; and ending with rejoicings at his restoration to life. We shall not recite the different versions of the legend of Atys and Cybele, given by Julius Firmicus, Diodorus, A rnobius, Lactan tius, Servius, Saint Augustine, and Pausanias. It is enough to say that it is in substance this: that Cybele, a Phrygian Princess, who invented musical instruments and dances, was enamored of Atys, a youth; that either he in a fit of frenzy mutilated himself or was mutilated by her in a parox ysm of jealousy; that he died, and afterward, like Adonis, wa s restored to life. It is the Phœnician fiction as to the Sun- God, expressed in other terms, under other forms, and with other names. Cybele was worshipped in Syria, under the name of Rhea. Lucian says that the Lydian Atys there established her wor ship and built her temple. The nam e of Rhea is also found in the ancient cosmogon y of the Phœnicians b y Sanchoniathon. It was Atys the Lydian, says Lucian, who, having been mut ilated, first established the Mysteries of Rhea, and taught the Phrygians, the Lydians, and the people of Samothr ace to celebrate them. Rhea, like Cybele, was represented drawn by lions, bearing a drum, and crowned with flowers. According to Varro, C ybele represented the earth. She partook of the characteristi cs of Minerva, Venus, the Moon, Diana, Nemesis, and the Furies; was clad in precious stones; and her High Priest wore a robe of purple and a tiara of gold. The Grand Feast of the Syrian Goddes s, like that of the Mother of the Gods at Rome, was celebrat ed at the Vernal Equinox. Precisely at that equinox the Mysteries of Atys were celebrat ed, in which the Initiat es were taught to expect the rewards of a future life, and the flight of Atys from the jealous fury of Cybele was described, his concealm ent in the mountains and in a cave, and his self-mut ilation in a fit of delirium ; in which act his priests imitated him. The feast of the passion of Atys continued three da ys; the first of which was passed in mourn ing and tears; to which afterward clamorous rejoicings succeeded; by which, Macrobius says, the Sun wa s adored under the name of Atys. The ceremon ies were all allegoric al, some of which, according to the Emperor Julian, could be explained, but more remained covered with the veil of mystery. Thus it is that symbols outlast their explanat ions, as man y have done in Masonry , and ignorance and rashness sub stitute new ones. In another legend, given by Pausanias, Atys dies, wounded like Adonis b y a wild boar in the organs of generation; a mutilation with which all the legends ended. The pine-tree under which he was said to have died, was sacred to him; and wa s found upon m any monuments, with a bull and a ram near it; one the sign of exaltation of the Sun, and the other of that of the Moon. The worship of the Sun under the name of Mithras belonged to Persia, whence that name came, as did the erudite symbols of that worship. The Persians, adorers of Fire, regarded the Sun as the most brilliant abode of the fecundating energy of that element, which gives life to the earth, and circulat es in ever y part of the Universe, of which it is, as it were, the soul. This worship passed from Persia into Armeni a, Cappadocia, and Cilicia, long before it was kno wn at Rome. The Mysteries of Mithras flourished more than an y others in the imperial city. The worship of Mithras commenced to prevail there under Trajan. Hadrian prohibited these M ysteries, on account of the cruel scenes represented in their ceremonial: Page 304 of 621"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike for human victims were im molated therein, and the events of futurit y looked for in their palpitating entrails. They reappeared in greater splendor than ever under Com modus, who with ins own hand sacrificed a victim to Mithras: and they were still more practised under Constantine and his successors, when the Priests of Mithras were found ever ywhere in the Roman Empire, and the monum ents of his wor ship appeared even in Britain. Caves were consecrated to Mithras, in which were collect ed a multitude of astronom ical emblems; and cruel tests were required of the Initiates. The Persians built no temp les; but worshipped upon the summ its of hills, in enclosures of unhewn stones. The y abomina ted images, and made the Sun and Fire emb lems of the Deity. The Jews borro wed this from them, and represented God as appearing to Abraham in a flame of fire, and to Mose s as a fire at Horeb and on Sinai. With the Persians, Mithras, ty pified in the Sun, wa s the invisible Deity, the Parent of the Universe, the Mediator. In Zoroaster's cave of initiation, the Sun and Planets were represented over-head, in gems and gold, as also was the Zodiac. The Sun appeared emerging from the back of Taurus. Three great pillars, Eternit y, Fecundit y, and Authorit y, supported the roof; and the whole was an emb lem of the Universe. Zoroaster, like Moses, clai med to have conversed face to face, as man with man, with the Deity; and to have received from Him a system of pure wor ship, to be com municated only to the virtuous, and those who w ould devote themselves to the study of Philosoph y. His fame spread over the world, and pupils came to him from every country . Even Pythagoras was his scholar. After his novitiate, the candidate entered the cavern of initiat ion, and was received on the point of a sword pre sented to his naked left breast, by which he was slightl y wounded. Being crowned with olive, anointed with balsam of benzoin, and other-wise prepared, he was purified with fire and water, and went through seven stages of initiation. The symbol of these stages was a high ladder with seven rounds or steps. In them, he went through many fearful trials, in which darkness displa yed a principal part. He saw a representation of the wicked in Hades; and finall y emerged from darkness into light. Received in a place representing Elysium, in the brillian t assembl y of the initia ted, where the Archim agus presided, robed in blue, he assumed the obligations of secrec y, and was entrusted with the Sacred Words, of w hich the Ineffable Name of God wa s the chief. Then all the incidents of his initiation were explained to him: he was taught that these ceremonies brought him nearer the Deity; and that he should adore the consecrated Fire, the gift of that Deit y and His visible residence. He was taught the sacred characters known only to the initiated ; and instructed in regard to the creation of the world, and the true philosophical meaning of the vulgar m ythology; and especiall y of the legend of Ormuzd and Ahriman, and the symbolic meaning of the six Amshaspands created by the former: Bahman , the Lord of Light; Ardibehest , the Genius of Fire; Shariver , the Lord of Splendor and Metals; Stapandomad , the Source of Fruitfulness; Khordad , the Genius of Water and Time; and Amerdad , the protector of the Vegetable World, and the pri me cause of growth.

Page 305 of 621"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike In the Mithriac initiation were several Degrees. The first, Tertull ian says, was that of Soldier of Mithras. The ceremon y of reception consisted in presenting the candidate a crown, supported b y a sword. It was placed near his head, and he repelled it, saying, \"Mithras is my crown.\" Then he was declared the soldier of Mithras, and had the right to call the other Initiates fellow- soldiers or compan ions in arms. Hence the title Companions in the Ro yal Arch Degree of the American Rite. Then he passed, Porphy ry says, through the Degree of the Lion, – the constella tion Leo, domicile of the Sun and symbol of Mithras, found on his monu ments, These ceremon ies were ter med at Rome Leontic and Heliac; and Coracia or Hiero-Co racia , of the Raven, a bird consecrated to the Sun, and a sign placed in the Heavens below the Lion, with the Hydra, and also appearing on the Mithriac monum ents. Thence he passed to a higher Degree, where the Initiates were called Perses and children of the Sun. A bove them were the Fathers, whose chief or Patriarch was sty led Father of Fathers, or Pater Patratus . The Initiat es also bore the title of Eagles and Hawks , birds consecrated to the Sun in Egypt, the former sacred to the God Mendes, and the latter the emblem of the Sun and Ro yalty. The little island of Samo thrace was long the depositar y of certain august Mysteries, and many went thither from all parts of Greece to be initia ted. It was said to have been settled by the ancient Pelasgi, early Asiatic colonists in Greece. The Gods adored in the M ysteries of this island were ter med CABIRI, an oriental word, from Caba r , great. Varro calls the Gods of Samothrac e, Potent Gods . In Arabic, Venus is called Cabar . Varro say s that the Great Deities whose M ysteries were practised there, were Heaven and Earth. These were but symbols of the Active and Passive Powers or P rinciples of universal generation. The two Twins, Castor and Pollux, or the Dioscuri, were also called the Gods of Samothrac e; and the Scholiast of Apollonius, citing Mnaseas, gives the nam es of Ceres, Pro serpine, Pluto, and Mercury , as the four Cabiric Divinities worshipped at Samothrace, as Axieros, Axiocersa, Axiocersus, and Casmil lus. Mercury was, there as ever ywhere, the minister and messenger of the Gods; and the young servitors of the altars and the children employed in the Temples were called Mercuries or Casmil li, as they were in Tuscany , by the Etrusci and Pelasgi, who w orshipped the Great Gods. Tarquin the Etruscan was an Initia te of the Mysteries of Samothra ce; and Etruria had its Cabiri as Samothr ace had. For the wor ship of the Cabiri spread from that island into Etruria, Phrygia, and Asia Minor: and it probabl y came from Phœnicia into Samothrace : for the Cabiri are men tioned by Sanchoniathon; and the word Caba r belongs to the Hebrew, Phœnician, and Arabic languages. The Dioscuri, tutelar y Deities of Navigation, with Venus, w ere invoked in the Mysteries of Samothr ace. The constella tion Auriga, or Phaëton, was also honored there with imposing ceremonies. Upon the Argonautic expedition, Orpheus, an Initiate of these M ysteries, a storm arising, counselled his comp anions to put into Samo thrace. They did so, the storm ceased, and the y were initiat ed into the Mysteries there, and sailed again with the assurance of a fortunate voyage, under the auspices of the Dioscuri, patrons of sailors and navigation. Page 306 of 621"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike But much more than that was promised the Initiates. The Hierophants of Samothrac e made something infinite ly greater to be the object of their initi ations; to wit, the consecration of men to the Deity, by pledging them to virtue; and the assurance of those rewards which the justice of the Gods reserves for Initia tes after death. This, above all else, made these ceremonies august, and inspired everywhere so great .a respect for them, and so great a desire to be adm itted to them. That originall y caused the island to be st yled Sacred . It was respected by all nations. The Romans, when masters of the world, left it its liberty and laws. It was an as ylum for the unfortunate, and a sanctuar y inviolable. There men were absolved of the cri me of homicid e, if not committed in a temple. Children of tender age were initiated there, and invested with the sacred-robe, the purple cincture, and the crown of olive, and seated upon a throne, like other Initiates. In the ceremonies was represented the death of the y oungest of the Cabiri, slain by his brothers, who fled into Etruria, carrying with them the chest or ark that contained his genitals: and there the Phallus and the sacred ark were adored. Herodotus sa ys that the Samothr acian Initiates understood the object and origin of this reverence paid the Phallus, and why it was exhibited in the Mysteries. Clemens of Alexandria says that the Cabiri taught the Tuscans to revere it. It was consecrated at Heliopolis in Syria, where the Mysteries of a Divinit y having many points of resemblan ce with Atys and Cybele were represented. The Pelasgi connected it with Mercury ; and it appears on the monuments of Mithras; always and everywhere a symbol of the life- giving power of the Sun at the Vernal Equinox. In the Indian M ysteries, as the candidate made his three circuits, he paused each time he reached the South, and said, \"I cop y the exa mple of the Sun, and follow his beneficent course.\" Blue Masonry has retained the Circuits, but has utterl y lost the explanation; which is, that in the Mysteries the candidate invariabl y represented the Sun, descending Southward toward the reign of the Evil Principle, Ahriman, Siba, or T yphon (darkness and winter); there figurativel y to be slain, and after a few da ys to rise again from the dead, and commence to ascend to the Northward. Then the death of Sita was be wailed; or that of Cama, slain b y Iswara, and com mitted to the waves on a chest, like Osiris and Bacchus; during which the candidate was terrified by phantoms and horrid noises. Then he was made to personify Vishnu, and perform his avatars, or labors. In the first two he was taught in allegori es the legend of the Deluge: in the first he took three steps at right angles, representing the three huge steps taken by Vishnu in that avatar; and hence the three steps in the Master' s Degree ending at right angles. The nine avatars finished, he was taught the necessit y of faith, as superior to sacrifices, acts of charit y, or mor tifications of the flesh. Then he was admonished against five cri mes, and took a solemn obligat ion never to comm it them. He was then introduced into a representation of Paradise; the Compan y of the Members of the Order, magn ificently arrayed, and the Altar with a fire blazing upon it, as an emblem of the Deity. Then a new name was given him, and he was invested in a white robe and tiara, and received the signs, tokens, and lectures. A cross wa s marked on his forehead, and an inverted level, or the Tau Cross, on his breast. He received the sacred cord, and divers Page 307 of 621"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike amulets or talis mans; and was then invested with the sacred Word or Sublime Name, known only to the initia ted, the Triliter al A. U. M . Then the mu ltitude of emb lems was explained to the candidat e; the arcana of science hidden under the m, and the different virtues of which the mythological figures were mere personificat ions. And he thus learned the me aning of those symbols, which, to the uninitia ted, were but a ma ze of unintell igible figures. The third Degree was a life of seclusion, after the Initiate's children were capable of providing for themse lves; passed in the forest, in the practice of pray ers and ablutions, and living only on vegetables. He was then said to be born again. The fourth was absolute renunciation of the world, self-conte mplation and self-torture; by which Perfection was thought to be attained, and the soul merged in the Deity. In the second Degree, the Initiate was taught the Unity of the Godhead, the happiness of the patriarchs, the destruction by the Deluge, the depravit y of the heart, and the necessit y of a mediator, the instabilit y of life, the final destruction of all created things, and the restoration of the world in a more perfect form. They inculcat ed the Eternit y of the Soul, explained the me aning of the doctrine of the Metemps ychosis, and held the doctrine of a state of future rewards and punishments: and the y also earnestl y urged that sins could onl y be atoned for b y repentance, reforma tion, and voluntar y penance; and not by mere ceremonies and sacrifices. The Mysteries among the Chinese and Japanese ca me from India, and were founded on the same principles and with similar rites. The word given to the new Initiate was O-MI-TO- FO, in which we recognize the original name A. U. M ., coupled at a much later time with that of Fo, the Indian Buddha, to show that he was the Great Deity Himself. The equilatera l triangle was one of their s ymbols; and so wa s the mystical Y ; both alluding to the Triune God, and the latter being the ineffable name of the Deit y. A ring supported by two serpents was embl ematical of the world, protected by the power and wisdom of the Creator; and that is the origin of the two paralle l 'lines (into which ti me has changed the two serpents), that support the circle in our Lodges. Among the Japanese, the term of probation for the highest Degree was twenty years. The main features of the Druidical Mysteries resemb led those of the Orient. The ceremon ies commenced with a h ymn to the sun. The candidates were arranged in ranks of threes , fives , and sevens , according to their qualifica tions; and conducted nine times around the Sanctuar y, from East to West. The candidate underwent man y trials, one of which had direct reference to the legend of Osiris. He was placed in a boat, and sent out to sea alone, having to rely on his own s kill and presence of m ind to reach the opposite shore in safety. The death of Hu was represented in his hearing, with ever y external mark of sorrow, w hile he was in utter darkness. He met with man y obstacles, had to prove his courage, and expose his life against armed enemies; represented various animals, and at last, attaining the perm anent light, he was instructed by the Arch-Druid in regard to the Mysteries, and in the morality of the Order, incited to act bravel y in war, taught the great Page 308 of 621"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike truths of the im mortality of the soul and a future state, solemn ly enjoined not to neglect the worship of the Deity, nor the practice of rigid morality; and to avoid sloth, contention, and folly. The aspirant attained only the exoteric knowledge in the first two Degrees. The third was attained only by a few, and they persons of rank and consequence, and after long purificat ion, and stud y of all the arts and sciences known to the Druids, in solitude, for nine months. This was the s ymbolical death and burial of these M ysteries. The dangerous vo yage upon the actual open sea, in a small boat covered with a skin, on the evening of the 29th of April, was the last trial, and closing scene, of initiation. If he declined this trial, he was dismissed with contemp t. If he m ade it and succeeded, he was termed thrice-born, wa s eligibl e to all the dignities of the State, and received complete instruction in the philosophical and religious doctrines of the Druids. The Greeks also sty led the Εποπτη ς, Τριγονος, thrice- born; and in India perfection was assigned to the Yogee who had acco mplished many births. The general features of the initia tions among the Goths were the same as in all the Mysteries. A long probation, of fasting and mort ification, circular processions, representing the march of the celesti al bodies, many fearful tests and trials, a descent into the infernal regions, the killing of the God Balder by the Evil Principle, Lok , the placing of his bod y in a boat and sending it abroad upon the waters; and, in short, the Eastern Legend, under different names, and with some variations. The Egyptian Anubis appeared there, as the dog guarding the gates of death. The candidate was immured in the representation of a tomb; and when released, goes in search of the body of Balder, and finds hi m, at length, restored to life, and seated upon a throne. He was obligated upon a naked sword (as is still the custom in the Rit Moderne ), and sealed his obligation by drinking mead out of a human skull . Then all the ancient primitive truths were mad e known to him, so far as they had survived the assaults of time: and he was informed as to the generation of the Gods, the creation of the world, the deluge, and the resurrection, of which that of Balder was a t ype. He was marked with the sign of the cross, and a ring was given to him as a sy mbol of the Divine Protection; and also as an emb lem of Perfection; from which comes the custom of giving a ring to the Aspirant in the 14th Degree. The point within a Circle, and the Cube, emblem of Odin, were explained to him; and lastly, the nature of the Supreme God, \"the author of every thing that existeth, the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Awful Being, the Searcher into concealed things, the Being that never changeth;\" with whom Odin the Conqueror was by the vulgar confounded: and the Triune God of the Indians was reproduced, as ODIN, the Almigh ty FATHER, FREA, ( Rhea or Phre ), his wife (emble m of universal matter ), and Thor his son (the Mediator). Here we recognize Osiris , Isis , and Hor or Horus . Around the head of Thor, as if to show his eastern origin, twelve stars were arranged in a circle.

The Initiate was prepared to receive the great lessons of all the Mysteries, by long trials, or by abstinence and chastit y. For man y days he was required to fast and be continent, and to drink liquids calcula ted to dimin ish his pas sions and keep him chaste. Ablutions were also required, symbolical of the purity necessary to enable the soul to escape from its bondage in m atter. Sacred baths and preparator y baptisms were u sed, lustrations, immersions, lustral sprinklings, and purifications of ever y kind. At Athens they bathed in the Ilissus, w hich thence became a sacred river; and before entering the Temple of Eleusis, all were required to wash their hands in a vase of lustral water placed near the entrance. Clean hands and a pure heart were required of the candidates. Apuleius bathed seven ti mes in the sea, s ymbolical of the Seven Spheres through which the Soul must reascend: and the Hindus must bathe in the sacred river Ganges. Clemens of Alexandria cites a passage of Menander, who speaks of a purification by sprinkling three times with salt and water. Sulphur, resin, and the laurel also served for purificat ion, as did air, earth, water, and fire. The Initiates at Heliopolis, in Syria, says Lucian, sacrificed the sacred lamb, symbol of Aries, then the sign of the Vernal Equinox; ate his flesh, as the Israelites did at the Passover; and then touched his head and feet to theirs, and knelt upon the fleece. Then they bathed in warm water, drank of the same, and slept upon the ground. There was a distinction between the lesser and greater Mysteries. One must have been for some years admitted to the form er, before he could receive the latter, which were but a preparation for them, the Vestibule of the Temple, of which those of Eleusis were the Sanctuar y. There, in the lesser M ysteries, they were prepared to receive the holy truths taught in the greater. The Initiates in the lesser were called simply Mystes , or Initiates; but those in the greater, Epoptes , or Seers. An ancient poet says that the former were an imperfect shadow of the latter, as sleep is of Death. After admission to the former, the Initiate was taught lessons of mora lity, and the rudiments of the sacred science, the most sublime and secret part of which was reserved for the Epopt, who saw the Truth in its nakedness, while the Mystes only viewed it through a veil and under emblems fitter to excite than to satisfy his curiosit y. Before communicating the first secrets and primar y dogmas of initiat ion, the priests required the candidate to take a fearful oath never to divulge the secrets. Then he made his vows, pray ers, and sacrifices to the Gods. The skins of the victi ms consecrated to Jupiter were spread on the ground, and he was made to set his feet upon them. He was then taught some enigma tic formulas, as answers to questions, b y which to make himself known. He was then enthroned, invested with a purple cincture, and crowned with flowers, or branches of palm or olive. We do not certainl y know the ti me that was required to elapse between the adm ission to the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of Eleusis. Most writers fix it at five years. It was a singular mark of favor when Demetrius was made Mystes and Epopt in one and the same Page 310 of 621"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike ceremony. When at length admitted to the Degree of Perfection, the Initiat e was brought face to face with entire nature, and learned that the soul was the whole of man; that earth was but his place of exile; that Heaven was his native country ; that for the soul to be born is really to die; and that death was for it the return to a new life. Then he entered the sanctuar y; but he did not receive the whole instruction at once. It continued through several years. There were, as it were, man y apartm ents, through which he advanced by degrees, and between which thick veils intervened. There were Statues and Paintings, says Proclus, in the inmost sanctuar y, showing the forms assumed by the Gods. Finall y the last veil fell, the sacred covering dropped from the image of the Goddes s, and she stood revealed in all her splendor, surrounded by a divine light, which, filling the whole sanctuar y, dazzled the eyes and penetrated the soul of the Initiate. Thus is s ymbolized the final revelation of the true doctrine as to the nature of Deity and of the soul, and of the relations of each to matter. This was preceded by frightful scenes, alterna tions of fear and joy, of light and darkness; by glittering lightning and the crash of thunder, and apparitions of spectres, or magi cal illusions, impressing at once the eyes and ears. This Claudian describes, in his poem on the rape of Proserpine, where he alludes to what passed in her M ysteries. \"The temple is shaken,\" he cries; \"fiercel y gleams the lightning, by which the Deity announces his presence. Earth trembles; and a terrible noise is heard in the midst of these terrors. The Temple of the Son of Cecrops resounds with long- continued roars; Eleusis uplifts her sacred torches; the serpents of Triptole mus are heard to hiss; and fearful Hecate appears afar.\" The celebration of the Greek Mysteries continued, according to the better opinion, for nine days. On the first the Initia tes met. It was the da y of the full moon, of the month Boëdro mion; when the moon was full at the end of the sign Aries, near the Pleiades and the place of her exaltation in Taurus. The second da y there was a procession to the sea, for purificat ion by bathing. The third was occupied with offerings, expiator y sacrifices, and other religious rites, such as fasting, mourning, continenc e, etc. A mulle t was imm olated, and offerings of grain and living animals made. On the fourth they carried in procession the mystic wreath of flowers, representing that which Proserpine dropped when seized by Pluto, and the Crown of A riadne in the Heavens. It was borne on a triumph al car drawn by oxen; and women followed bearing mystic chests or boxes, wrapped with purple cloths, containing grains of sesame, pyramidal biscuits, salt, pomegran ates and the mysterious serpent, and perhaps the mystic phallus. On the fifth was the superb procession of torches, commemorative of the search for Proserpine by Ceres; the Initiates marching by trios, and each bearing a torch; while at the head of the procession marched the Dadoukos. The sixth was consecrated to Iakchos, the young Light-God, son of Ceres, reared in the sanctuaries and bearing the torch of the Sun-God.

He was brought from the sanctuary , his head crowned with m yrtle, and borne from the gate of the Cera micus to Eleusis, along the sacred wa y, amid dances, sacred songs, every mark of joy, and mystic cries of Iakchos . On the seventh there were g ymnastic exercises and comba ts, the victors in which were crowned and rewarded. On the eighth was the feast of Æscu lapius. On the ninth the famous libation was made for the souls of the departed. The Priests, according to Athenæus, filled two vases, placed one in the East and one in the West, toward the gates of day and night, and overturned them, pronouncing a formula of mysterious prayers. Thus the y invoked Light and Darkness, the two great principles of nature. During all these days no one could be arrested, nor an y suit brought, on pain of death, or at least a heavy fine: and no one was allowed, by the displa y of unusual wealth or magnificence, to endeavor to rival this sacred pomp. Everything was for religion. Such were the Mysteries; and such the Old Thought, as in scattered and widel y separated fragments it has come down to us. The human mind still speculates upon the great mysteries of nature, and still finds its ideas anticipa ted by the ancients, whose profoundest thoughts are to be looked for, not in their philosophies, but in their symbols, by which the y endeavored to express the great ideas that vainly struggled for utterance in words, as the y viewed the great circle of phenomena, – Birth, Life, Death, or Decomposition, and New Life out of Death and Rottenness, – to them the greatest of mysteries. Remember, while you study their symbols, that they had a profounder sense of these wonders than we have. To them the transforma tions of the worm were a greater wonder than the stars; and hence the poor dumb scarabæus or beetle was sacred to them. Thus their faiths are condensed into symbols or expanded into allegories, which the y understood, but were not alwa ys able to explain in language; for there are thoughts and ideas which no language ever spoken by man has words to express.

THIS Degree is both philosophical and moral. While it teaches the necessit y of reformat ion as well as repentance, as a means of obtaining mercy and forgiveness, it is also devoted to an explanation of the symbols of Masonry; and especiall y to those which are connected with that ancient and universal legend, of which that of Khir-Om Abi is but a variation; that legend which, representing a murder or a death, and a restoration to life, by a drama in which figure Osiris, I sis and Horus, At ys and Cy bele, Adonis and Venus, the Cabiri, Dionusos, and man y another representativ e of the active and passive Powers of Nature, taught the Initiates in the Mysteries that the rule of Evil and Darknes s is but temporar y, and that that of Light and Good will be eternal. Maimon ides says: \"In the days of Enos, the son of Seth, men fell into grievous errors, and even Enos himself partook of their infatuat ion. Their language was, that since God has placed on high the heavenl y bodies, and used them as His ministers, it was evidentl y His will that they should receive from man the same veneration as the servants of a great prince justly claim from the subject mul titude. Impressed with this notion, they began to build temples to the Stars, to sacrifice to them, and to worship them, in the vain expectation that they should thus please the Creator of all things. At first, indeed, the y did not suppose the Stars to be the onl y Deities, but adored in conjunction with them the Lord God Omnipot ent. In proces s of time, however, that great and venerable Name was totally forgotten, and the whole human race retained no other religion than the idolatrous worship of the Host of Heaven.\" The first learning in the world consisted chiefly in symbols. The wisdom of the Chaldæans, Phœnicians, Egyptians, Jews; of Zoroaster, Sanchoniathon, Pherec ydes, Syrus, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, of all the ancients, that is come to our hand, is s ymbolic. It was the mode, says Serranus on Plato's Sy mposium, of the Ancient Philosophers, to represent truth b y certain symbols and hidden images. \"All that can be said concerning the Gods,\" s ays Strabo, \"must be by the exposition of old opinions and fables; it being the custom of the ancients to wrap up in enig ma and allegor y their thoughts and discourses concerning Nature; which are therefore not easily explained.\" Page 313 of 621"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike As you learned in the 24th Degree, m y Brother, the ancient Philosophers regarded the soul of man as having had its origin in Heaven. That was, Macrobius say s, a settled opinion among them all; and the y held it to be the onl y true wisdom, for the soul, while united with the body, to look ever toward its source, and strive to return to the place whence it came. Among the fixed stars it dwelt, until, seduced b y the desire of ani mating a body, it descended to be imprisoned in matter. Thenceforward it has no other resource than recollec tion, and is ever attrac ted toward its birth- place and home. The means of return are to be sought for in itself. To re-ascend to its source, it must do and suffer in the body. Thus the Mysteries taught the great doctrine of the divine nature and longings after immortality of the soul, of the nobility of its origin, the grandeur of its destiny , its superiorit y over the animals who have no aspirations heavenward. If they struggled in vain to express its nature , by comparing it to Fire and Light, – if the y erred as to its original place of abode, and the mode of its descent, and the path which, descending and ascending, it pursued among the stars and spheres, these were the accessories of the Great Truth, and mere allegories designed to mak e the idea more impressive, and, as it were, tangible, to the human mind. Let us, in order to understand this old Thought, first follow the soul in its descent. The sphere or Heaven of the fixed stars was that Hol y Region, and those Elysian Fields, that were the native domicile of souls, and the place to which the y re-ascended, when they had recovered their primitive purity and simpl icity. From that luminous region the soul set forth, when it journey ed toward the body; a destination which it did not reach until it had undergone three degradations, designated by the nam e of Deaths; and until it had pas sed through the several spheres and the elements. All souls rema ined in possession of Heaven and of happiness, s o long as they were wise enough to avoid the contagion of the body, and to keep the mselves from any contact with matter. But those who, from that lofty abode, where the y were lapped in eternal light, have looked longingl y toward the body, and toward that which we here below call life , but which is to the soul a real death ; and who have conceived for it a secret desire, – those souls, victi ms of their concupiscence, are attracted by degrees toward the inferior regions of the world, b y the mere weight of thought and of that terrestrial desire. The soul, perfectl y incorporeal, does not at once invest itself with the gross envelope of the body, but little by little, by successive and insensible alterations, and in proportion as it removes further and further from the simple and perfect substance in which it dwelt at first. It first surrounds itself with a bod y composed of the substance of the stars; and afterward, as it descends through the several spheres, with etherea l matter more and mor e gross, thus b y degrees descending to an earthly body; and its number of degradations or deaths being the same as that of the spheres which it traverses. The Galaxy , Macrobius says, crosses the Zodiac in two oppo site points, Cancer and Capricorn, the tropical points in the sun' s course, ordinaril y called the Gates of the Sun. These two tropics, before his tim e, corresponded with those constellat ions, but in his day with Gemini and Sagittarius, in consequence of the precession of the equinoxes; but the signs of the Zodiac remained unchanged; and the Milky Way crossed at the signs Cancer and Capricorn, though not at those constellations . Page 314 of 621"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Through these gates souls were supposed to descend to earth and re- ascend to Heaven. One, Macrobius sa ys, in his drea m of Scipio, was styled the Gate of Men; and the other, the Gate of the Gods. Cancer was the former, because souls descended by it to the earth; and Capricorn the latter, because by it they re-ascended to their seats of imm ortality, and became Gods. From the Milky Way, according to Pythagoras, diverged the route to the dominions of Pluto. Until they left the Galax y, they were not deemed to have commenced to descend toward the terrestrial bodies. From that they departed, and to that they returned. Until they reached the sign Cancer, they had not left it, and were still Gods. When they reached Leo, they commenced their apprenticeship for their future condition; and when they were at Aquarius, the sign opposite Leo, the y were furthest removed from human life. The soul, descending from the celestial limits, where the Zodiac and Galax y unite, loses its spherical shape, the shape of all Divine Nature, and is lengthened into a cone, as a point is lengthened into a line; and then, an indivisible monad before, it divides itself and becom es a dead – that is, unit y becomes division, disturbance, and conflict. Then it begins to experience the disorder which reigns in matter, to which it unites itself, becoming, as it were, intoxica ted by draughts of gro sser ma tter: of which inebriat ion the cup of Bakchos, between Cancer and Leo, is a symbol. It is for them the cup of forgetfulness. They assembl e, says Plato, in the fields of oblivion, to drink there the water of the river Ameles, which causes men to forget ever ything. This fiction is also found in Virgil. \"If souls,\" say s Macrobius, \"carried with them into the bodies the y occupy all the knowledge which they had acquired of divine things, during their sojourn in the Heavens, men would not differ in opinion as to the Deity; but some of them forget more, and some less, of that which they had learned.\" We smile at these notions of the ancients; but we must learn to look through these mat erial images and allegori es, to the ideas, struggling for utterance, the great speechless thoughts which they envelop: and it is well for us to consider whether we our selves have yet found out any better way of representing to ourselves the soul's origin and its advent into this body, so entirel y foreign to it; if, indeed, we have ever thought about it at all; or have not ceased to think, in despair. The highest and purest portion of matt er, which nourishes and constitutes divine existences, is what the poets ter m nectar , the beverage of the Gods. The lower, more disturbed and gros ser portion, is what intoxicates souls. The ancients symbolized it as the River Lethe, dark strea m of oblivion. How do we explain the soul's forgetfulness of its anteceden ts, or reconcile that utter absence of reme mbrance of its former condition, with its essential immortality? In truth, we for the most part dread and shrink from any attempt at explanation of it to ourselves. Dragged down b y the heaviness produced by this inebriating draught, the soul falls along the zodiac and the milky way to the lower spheres, and in its descent not only takes, in each sphere, a new envelope of the material composing the lum inous bodies of the planets, but receives there the different faculties which it is to exercise while it inhabits the body. In Saturn, it acquires the power of reasoning and intell igence, or what is ter med the logical and contemp lative faculty. From Jupiter it receives the power of action. Mars gives it valor, enterprise, and imp etuosity. From the Sun it receives the senses and im agination, Page 315 of 621"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike which produce sensation, perception, and thought. Venus inspires it with desires. Mercury gives it the faculty of expressing and enunciat ing what it thinks and feels. And, on entering the sphere of the Moon, it acquires the force of generation and growth. This lunary sphere, lowest and basest to divine bodies, is first and highest to terrestrial bodies. And the lunar y body there assumed by the soul, while, as it were, the sediment of celestial matter, is also the first substance of anima l matter. The celestial bodies, Heaven, the Stars, and the other Divine ele ments, ever aspire to rise. The soul reaching the region which mor tality inhabits, tends toward terrestrial bodies, and is deemed to die. Let no one, sa ys Macrobius, be surprised that we so frequentl y speak of the death of this soul, which yet we call immortal. It is neither annulled nor destro yed by such death: but merely enfeebled for a ti me; and does not thereby forfeit its prerogative of immortality; for afterward, freed from the bod y, when it has been purified from the vice- stains contracted during that connection, it is re-established in all its privileges, and returns to the lum inous abode of its immortality. On its return, it restores to each sphere through which it ascends, the passions and earthly faculties received from them: to the Moon, the faculty of increase and dim inution of the body; to Mercury , fraud, the architect of evils; to Venus, the seductive love of pleasure; to the Sun, the passion for greatness and empire ; to Mars, audacit y and tem erity; to Jupiter, avarice; and to Saturn, falsehood and deceit: and at last, relieved of all, it enters naked and pure into the eighth sphere or highest Heaven. All this agrees with the doctrine of Plato, that the soul cannot re- enter into Heaven, until the revolutions of the Universe shall have restored it to its pri mitive condition, and purified it from the effects of its contact with the four ele ments. This opinion of the pre-existence of souls, as pure and celestial substances, before their union with our bodies, to put on and ani mate which the y descend from Heaven, is one of great antiquit y. A modern Rabbi, Manasseh Ben Israel, says it was alway s the belief of the Hebrews. It was that of most philosophers who admi tted the immortality of the soul: and therefore it was taught in the M ysteries; for, as Lactantius says, they could not see how it was pos sible that the soul should exist after the bod y, if it had not existed before it, and if its nature was not independent of that of the bod y. The same doctrine was adopted by the most learned of the Greek Fathers, and by many of the Latins: and it would probabl y prevail largely at the present da y, if men troubled themselves to think upon this subject at all, and to inquire whether the soul's im mortality involved its prior existence. Some philosophers held that the soul was incarcerated in the body, by way of punishment for sins com mitted by it in a prior state. How they reconcil ed this with the same soul's unconsciousness of an y such prior state, or of sin com mitted there, does not appear. Others held that God, of his m ere will, sent the soul to inhabit the body. The Kabalists united the two opinions. They held that there are four worlds, Aziluth , Briarth , Jezirath , and Aziath ; the world of emanation , that of creation , that of forms , and the material world; one above and more perfect than the other, in that order, both as regards their own nature and that of the beings who inhabit them. All souls are original ly in the world Aziluth, the Suprem e Heaven, abode of God, and of pure and immortal spirits. Those who descend from it without fault of their own, by God's order, are gifted with a divine fire, which preserves Page 316 of 621"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike them from the contagion of matter, and restores the m to Heaven so soon as their mission is ended. Those who descend through, their own fault, go from world to world, insensibly losing their love of Divine things, and their self-conte mplation; until they reach the world Aziath, falling by their own weight. This is a pure Platonis m, clothed with the i mages and words peculiar to the Kabalists. It was the doctrine of the Essenes, who, says Porphy ry, \"believe that souls descend from the most subtile ether, attracted to bodies b y the seductions of matter.\" It was in substance the doctrine of Origen; and it came from the Chaldæans, who largel y studied the theory of the Heavens, the spheres, and the influences of the signs and constellations. The Gnostics made souls ascend and descend through eight Heavens, in each of which were certain Powers that opposed their return, and often drove them back to earth, when not sufficient ly purified. The last of these Powers, nearest the luminous abode of souls, was a serpent or dragon. In the ancient doctrine, certain Genii were charged with the dut y of conducting souls to the bodies destined to receive them, and of withdrawing them from those bodies. According to Plutarch, these were the functions of Proserpine and Mercury. In Plato, a familiar Genius accompanies man at his birth, follows and watches hi m all his life, and at death conducts him to the tribunal of the Great Judge. These Genii are the med ia of communication between man and the Gods; and the soul is ever in their presence. This doctrine is taught in the oracles of Zoroaster: and these Genii were the Intelligenc es that resided in the planets. Thus the secret science and mysterious emblems of initiation were connected with the Heavens, the Spheres, and the Constellations: and this connection must be studied by whomsoever would understand the ancient mind, and be enabled to interpret the allegories, and explore the meaning of the symbols, in which the old sages endeavored to delinea te the ideas that struggled within them for utterance, and could be but insufficientl y and inadequate ly expressed b y language, whose word s are images of those things alone that can be grasped b y and are within the emp ire of the senses. It is not pos sible for us thoroughl y to appreciate the feelings with which the ancients regarded the Heavenly bodies, and the ideas to which their observation of the Heavens gave rise, because we cannot put ourselves in their places, look at the stars with their eyes in the world' s youth, and divest ourselves .of the knowledge which even the com monest of us have, that makes us regard the Stars and Planets and all the Universe of Suns and Worlds, as a mere inanim ate machin e and aggregate of senseless orbs, no more astonishing, except in degree, than a clock or an orrery . We wonder and are a mazed at the Power and Wisdom (to most men it seems only a kind of Infinite Ingenuity ) of the MAKER: they wondered at the Work , and endowed it with Life and Force and mysterious Powers and might y Influences.

Its inundations had form ed the alluvial lands of Upper and Lower Eg ypt, which they continued to raise higher and higher, and to fertilize by their deposits. At first, as in all newly-settled countries, those inundations, occurring annuall y and alway s at the same period of the y ear, were cala mities: until, by means of levees and drains and artificia l lakes for irrigation, they became blessings, and were looked for with joy ful anticipat ion, as they had before been awaited with terror. Upon the deposit left by the Sacred River, as it withdrew into its banks, the husbandman sowed his seed; and the rich soil and the genial sun insured him an abundant harvest. Babylon lay on the Euphrates, which ran from Southeast to Northwest, blessing, as all rivers in the Orient do, the arid countr y through which it flowed; but its rapid and uncertain overflows bringing terror and disaster. To the ancients, as yet inventors of no astronom ical instrum ents, and looking at the Heavens with the eyes of children, this earth was a level plain of unkno wn extent. About its boundaries there was speculation, but no knowledge. The inequali ties of its surface were the irregularit ies of a plane. That it was a globe, or that anything lived on its under surface, or on w hat it rested, the y had no idea. Every twenty-four hours the sun came up from beyond the Eastern rim of the world, and travelled across the sky, over the earth, always South of, but someti mes nearer and someti mes further from the point overhead; and sunk below the world's Western rim. With him went light, and after hi m followed darkness. And every twenty-four hours appeared in the Heavens another body, visible chiefl y at night, but somet imes even when the sun shone, which likewise, as if following the sun at a greater or less distance, travelled across the sky; sometimes as a thin crescent, and thence increasing to a full orb resplendent with silver light; and somet imes more and somet imes less to the Southward of the point overhead, within the same limits as the Sun. Man, enveloped by the thick darkness of profoundest night, when ever ything around him has disappeared, and he seems alone with himself and the black shades that surround him, feels his existence a blank and nothingness, except so far as me mory recalls to him the glories and splendors of light. Everything is dead to him, and he, as it were, to Nature. How crushing and overwhelm ing the thought, the fear, the dread, that perhaps that darkness ma y be eternal, and that day may possibly never return; if it ever occurs to his mind, while the solid gloo m closes up against him like a wall! What then can restore him to like, to energy , to activity, to fellowship and communion with the great world which God has spread around him, and which perhaps in the darknes s may be passing awa y? LIGHT restores hi m to himself and to nature which seemed lost to hi m. Naturall y, therefore, the primitive men regarded light as the principle of their real existence, without which life would be but one continued weariness and despair. This necessity for light, and its actual creative energy , were felt by all men: and nothing was more alarming to them than its absence. It beca me their first Divinit y, a single ray of which, flashing into the dark tumultuous bosom of chaos, caused man and all the Universe to emerge from it.

The Sun wa s to them a great globe of fire, of unkno wn dimensions, at an unkno wn distance. The Moon wa s a mass of softer light; the stars and planets lucent bodies, armed with unknown and supernatural influences. It could not fail to be soon ob served, that at regular intervals the days and nights were equal; and that two of these intervals measured the same space of time as elapsed between the successive inundations, and between the returns of spring-tim e and harvest. Nor could it fail to be perceived that the changes of the moon occurred regularl y; the same number of days always elapsing between the first appearance of her silver crescent in the West at evening and that of her full orb rising in the East at the same hour; and the same again, between that and the new appearance of the crescent in the West. It was also soon observed that the Sun cro ssed the Heavens in a different line each da y, the days being longest and the nights shortest when the line of his passage was furthest North, and the days shortest and nights longest when that line was furthest South: that his progres s North and South was perfectl y regular, m arking four periods that were always the same, – those when the days and nights were equal, or the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes; that when the days were longest, or the Summer Solstice; and that when the y were shortest, or the Winter Solstice. With the Vernal Equinox, or about the 25th of March of our Calendar, they found that there unerringl y came soft winds, the return of warmth, caused by the Sun turning back to the Northward from the middle ground of his course, the vegetation of the new ye ar, and the impulse to ama tory action on the part of the ani mal creation. Then the Bull and the Ram, animals most valuable to the agriculturist, and symbols themselv es of vigorous generative power, recovered their vigor, the birds mated and budded their nests, the seeds germinated, the grass grew, and the trees put forth leaves. With the Sum mer Solstice, when the Sun reached the extre me northern li mit of his course, cam e great heat, and burning winds, and lassitude and exhaustion; then vegetation withered, man longed for the cool breezes of Spring and Autumn, and the cool water of the wintr y Nile or Euphrates, and the Lion sought for that element far from his home in the desert. With the Autumnal Equinox ca me ripe harvests, and fruits of the tree and vine, and falling leaves, and cold evenings presaging wintry frosts; and the Principle and Powers of Darkness, prevailing over those of Light, drove the Sun further to the South, so that the nights grew longer than the days. And at the Winter Solstice the earth, was wrinkled with frost, the trees were leafless, and the Sun reaching the most Southern point in his career, seemed to hesitate whether to continue descending, to leave the world to darkness and despair, or to turn upon his steps and retrace his course to the Northward, bringing back seed-time and Spring, and green leaves and flowers, and all the delights of love.

Wholly agricultura l, and in their frail habitations greatly at the mercy of the elements and the changing seasons, the pri mitive people of the Orient were most deeply interested in the recurrence of the periodica l phenom ena presented by the two great luminaries of Heaven, on whose regularit y all their prosperit y depended. And the attentive observer soon noticed that the smal ler lights of Heaven were, apparentl y, even more regular than the Sun and Moon, and foretold with unerring certaint y, by their risings and settings, the periods of recurrence of the different phenomen a and seasons on which the physical well-being of all men depended. The y soon felt the necessit y of distinguishing the individual stars, or groups of stars, and giving them names, that they might understand each other, when referring to and designating them. Necessity produced designations at once natural and artificia l. Observing that, in the circle of the year, the renewal and periodica l appearance of the productions of the earth were constantl y associated, not only with the courses of the Sun, but also with the rising and setting of certain Stars, and with their position relativel y to the Sun, the centre to which they referred the whole starr y host, the mind naturall y connected the celestia l and terrestria l objects that were in fact connected: and they commenced by giving to particular Stars or group s of Stars the names of those terrestrial objects which seem ed connected with them ; and for those which still remain ed unnam ed by this nomen clature, they, to comp lete a system, assumed arbitrar y and fanciful names. Thus the Ethiopian of Thebes or Saba st yled those Stars under which the Nile commenced to overflow, Stars of Inundation, or that poured out water (AQUARIU S). Those Stars among which the Sun wa s, when he had reached the Northern Tropic and began to retreat Southward, were term ed, from his retrograde motion, the Crab (CANCER). As he approached, in Autumn, the midd le point between the Northern and Southern extremes of his journey ing, the days and nights beca me equal; and the Stars among which he was then found were called Stars of the Balance (LIBRA). Those stars among which the Sun wa s, when the Lion, driven from the Desert by thirst, came to slake it at the Nile, were called Stars of the Lion (LEO). Those among which the Sun wa s at harvest, were called those of the Gleaning Virgin, holding a Sheaf of Wheat (VIRGO). Those among which he was found in February , when the Ewes brought forth their young, were called Stars of the La mb (Arms). Those in March, when it was time to plough, were called Stars of the Ox (TAUR US). Those under w hich hot and burning winds came from the desert, venomous like poisonous reptiles, were called Stars of the Scorpion (SC ORPIO).

Thus com mencing, and as astronom y came to be mor e studied, imagin ary figures were traced all over the Heavens, to which the different Stars w ere assigned. Chief a mong them were those that lay along the path which the Sun travelled as he cli mbed toward the North and descended to the South: lying within certain limits and extending to an equal distance on each side of the line of equal nights and da ys. This belt, curving like a Serpent, was termed the Zodiac, and divided into twelve Signs. At the Vernal Equinox, 2455 y ears before our Era, the Sun wa s entering the sign and constella tion Taurus, or the Bull; having passed through, since he commenced, at the Winter Solstice, to ascend Northward, the Signs Aquarius, Pisces and Aries; on entering the first of which he reached the lowest limit of his journey Southward. From TAURU S, he passed through Gemini and Cancer, and reached LEO when he arrived at the terminus of his journey Northward. Thence, through Leo, Virgo, and Libra, he entered SCORPI O at the Autumna l Equinox, and journey ed Southward through Scorpia, Sagittarius, and Capricornus to AQUARIUS, the ter minus of his journey South. The path by which he journeyed through these signs became the Eclipt ic ; and that which passes through the two equinoxes, the Equator . They knew nothing of the immutable laws of nature; and whenever the Sun com menced to tend Southward, they feared lest he migh t continue to do so, and b y degrees disappear forever, leaving the earth to be ruled forever b y darkness, storm, and cold. Hence they rejoiced when he comm enced to re-ascend after the Winter Solstice, struggling against the malign influences of Aquarius and Pisces, and am icably received by the Lamb. And when at the Vernal Equinox he entered Taurus, they still more rejoiced at the assurance that the days would again be longer than the nights, that the season of s eed-time had come, and the Summ er and harvest would follow. And the y lamented when, after the Autumnal Equinox, the malign influence of the venomous Scorpion, and vindictive Archer, and the filthy and ill- omened He-Goat dragged him down toward the Winter Solstice. Arriving there, the y said he had been slain, and had gone to the realm of darkness. Remaining there three da ys, he rose again, and again ascended Northward in the heavens, to redeem the earth from the gloom and darkness of Winter, which soon becam e emblematical of sin, and evil, and suffering; as the Spring, Summ er, and Autumn became emblems of happiness and im mortality. Soon the y personified the Sun, and wor shipped him under the na me of OSIRI S, and transmu ted the legend of his descent among the Winter Signs, into 'a fable of his death, his descent into the infernal regions, and his resurrection.

From the journey of the Sun through the twelve signs came the legend of the twelve labors of Hercules, and the in carnations of Vishnu and Buddha. Hence came the legend of the murder of Kh r m, representative of the Sun, by the three Fellow-crafts, symbols of the ū ū three Winter signs, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, who assailed him at the three gates of Heaven and s lew him at the Winter Solstice. Hence the search for hi m by the nine Fellow- crafts, the other nine signs, his finding, burial, and resurrection. The celestial Taurus, opening the new y ear, was the Creative Bull of the Hindus and Japanese, breaking with his horn the egg out of which the world is born. Hence the bull Arts was w orshipped b y the Egyptians, and reproduced as a golden calf by Aaron in the desert. Hence the cow wa s sacred to the Hindus. Hence, from the sacred and beneficent signs of Taurus and Leo, the human- headed winged lions and bulls in the palaces at Kouyounjik and Nimroud, like which were the Cherubi m set by Solomon in his Temp le: and hence the twelve brazen or bronze oxen, on which the laver of bras s was supported. The Celestial Vulture or Eagle, rising and setting with the Scorpion, was s ubstituted in its place, in many cases, on account of the malign influences of the latter: and thus the four great periods of the year were marked by the Bull, the Lion, the Man (Aquarius) and the Eagle; which were upon the respective standards of Ephrai m, Judah, Reuben, and Dan; and still appear on the shield of Ameri can Royal Arch Ma sonry. Afterward the Ram or Lamb became an object of adoration, when, in his turn, he opened the equinox, to deliver the world from the wintr y reign of darkness and evil. Around the central and simpl e idea of the annual death and resurrection of the Sun a multitude of circu mstantial details soon clustered. Some were derived from other astronom ical phenomen a; while many were merel y poetical ornaments and inventions. Besides the Sun and Moon, those ancients also saw a beautiful Star, shining with a soft, silvery light, always following the Sun at no great distance when he set, or preceding him when he rose. Another of a red and angr y color, and still another more kingly and brilliant than all, early attracted their attention, by their free movem ents among the fixed hosts of Heaven: and the latter by his unusual brillianc y, and the regularit y with which he rose and set. These were Venus, Mar s, and Jupiter. Mercur y and Saturn could scarcely have been noticed in the world's infancy , or until astrono my began to assume the proportions of a science. In the projection of the celestial sphere b y the astronomic al priests, the zodiac and constella tions, arranged in a circle, presented their halves in diametrical opposition; and the hemisphere of Winter was said to be adverse, opposed, contrar y, to that of Sum mer. Over the angels of the latter ruled a king (OSIRIS or O RMUZD), enlightened, intelligen t, creative, and beneficent. Over the fallen angels or evil genii of the form er, the demons or Devs of the subterranean empire of darknes s and sorrow, and its stars, ruled also a chief. In Egypt the Scorpion first ruled, the sign next the Balance, and long the chief of the Winter Page 322 of 621"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike signs; and then the Polar Bear or Ass, called Typhon, that is, deluge , on account of the rains which inundated the earth while that constellation domine ered. In Persia, at a later day, it was the serpent, which, personified as Ahriman, was the Evil Principle of the religion of Zoroaster. The Sun does not arrive at the same moment in each year at the equinocti al point on the equator. The explanation of his anticip ating that point belongs to the science of astronom y; and to that we refer y ou for it. The consequence is, what is termed the precession of the equinoxes, by means of which the Sun is constantl y changing his place in the zodiac, at each vernal equinox; so that now, the signs retaining the nam es which the y had 300 ye ars before Christ, the y and the constellations do not correspond; the Sun being now in the constellat ion Pisces, when he is in the sign Aries. The annual amount of precession is 50 seconds and a litt le over [50\" 1.]. The period of a complete Revolution of the Equinoxes, 25,856 y ears. The precession amounts to 30° or a sign, in 2155.6 ye ars. So that, as the sun now enters Pisces at the Vernal Equinox, he entered Aries at that period, 300 y ears B. C., and Taurus 2455 B. C. And the division of the Eclipti c, now called Taurus, lies in the Constellation Aries; while the sign Gemini is in the Constella tion Taurus. Four thousand six hundred and ten years before Christ, the sun entered Gemin i at the Vernal Equinox.

From confounding signs with causes came the worship of the sun and stars. \"If,\" s ays Job, \"I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon progressive in brightness; and m y heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed m y hand, this were an iniquit y to be punished by the Judge; for I should have denied the God that is above.\" Perhaps we are not, on the whole, much wiser than those simpl e men of the old time. For what do we know of effec t and cause , except that one thing regularl y or habituall y follows another? So, because the heliaca l rising of Sirius preceded the rising of the Nile, it was deemed to cause it; and other stars were in like manner held to cause extreme heat, bitter cold, and watery storm. A religious reverence for the zodiacal Bull [TAUR US] appears, from a very early period, to have been pretty general, perhaps it was universal, throughout Asia; from that chain or region of Caucasus to which it gave name; and which is still known under the appellation of Mount Taurus, to the Southern extrem ities of the Indian Peninsula; extending itself also into Europe, and through the Eastern parts of A frica. This evidentl y originated during those remo te ages of the world, when the colure of the vernal equinox passed across the stars in the head of the sign Taurus [among which was Aldebarán]; a period when, as the most ancient monuments of all the oriental nations attest, the light of arts and letters first shone forth. The Arabian word AL-DE-BAR ÁN, means the foremost , or leading , star: and it could onl y have been so named, when it did precede, or lead , all others. The year then opened with the sun in Taurus; and the multitude of ancient sculptures, both in As syria and Eg ypt, wherein the bull appears with lunette or crescent horns, and the disk of the sun between the m, are direct allusions to the import ant festival of the first new moon of the y ear: and there was everywhere an annual celebrat ion of the festival of the first new moon, when the y ear opened with Sol and Luna in Taurus. David sings: \"Blow the trump et in the New Moon ; in the time appointed; on our s olemn feast-day: for this is a statute unto Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. This he ordained to Joseph, for a testi mony, when he came out of the land of Eg ypt.\" The reverence paid to Taurus continued long after, by the precession of the Equinoxes, the colure of the vernal equinox had com e to pass through Aries. The Chinese still have a temple, called \"The Palace of the horned Bull\"; and the same symbol is worshipped in Japan and all over Hindostan. The Cimbrians carried a brazen bull with them, as the im age of their God, when they overran Spain and Gaul; and the representation of the Creation, by the Deity in the shape of a bull, breaking the shell of an egg with his horns, mean t Taurus, Page 324 of 621"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike opening the year, and bursting the symbolical shell of the annuall y-recurring orb of the new year. Theophilus says that the Osiris of Egy pt was supposed to be dead or absent fift y days in each year. Landseer thinks that this wa s because the Sabæan priests were accusto med to see, in the lower latitudes of Egypt and Ethiopia, the first or chief stars of the Husbandm an [BOÖTES] sink achronical ly beneath the Western horizon; and then to begin their lamentations, or hold forth the signal for others to weep: and when his prolific virtues were supposed to be transferred to the vernal sun, bacchanalian revelry became devotion. Before the colure of the Vernal Equinox had passed into Aries, and after it had left Aldebarán and the Hyades, the Pleiades were, for seven or eight centuries, the leading stars of the Sabæan y ear. And thus we see, on the monum ents, the disk and crescent, symbols of the sun and moon in conjunction, appear successivel y, – first on the head, and then on the neck and back of the Zodiacal Bull, and more recentl y on the forehead of the Ram. The diagram matical character or symbol, still in use to denote Taurus, ♉ , is this ver y crescent and disk: a s ymbol that has com e down to us from those remo te ages w hen this memorable conjunction in Taurus, b y marking the commencement, at once of the Sabæan year and of the cycle of the Chaldæan Saros, s o pre-eminen tly distinguished that sign as to become its characteristi c symbol. On a bronze bull from China, the crescent is attached to the back of the Bull, by means of a cloud, and a curved groove is provided for the occasional introduction of the disk of the sun, when solar and lunar time were coinciden t and conjunctive, at the commencement of the year, and of the lunar cycle. When that was made, the year did not open with the stars in the head of the Bull, but when the colure of the vernal equinox passed across the middle or later degrees of the asterism Taurus, and the Pleiades were, in China, as in Canaan, the leading stars of the y ear. The crescent and disk comb ined always represent the conjunctive Sun and Moon; and when placed on the head of the Zodiacal Bull, the commencement of the c ycle termed SAROS by the Chaldæans, and Metonic by the Greeks; and supposed to be alluded to in Job, by the phrase, \"Mazzaroth in his season\"; that is to sa y, when the first new Moon and new Sun of the year were coincident, which happened once in eighteen years and a fraction. On the sarcophagus of Alexander, the same symbol appears on the head of a Rain, which, in the time of that monarch, was the leading sign. S o too in the sculptured temples of the Upper Nile, the crescent and disk appear, not on the head of Taurus, but on the forehead of the Ram or the Ram-headed God, whom the Grecian Mythologists called Jupiter Ammon, really the Sun in Aries. If we now look for a mo ment at the individual stars which composed and were near to the respective constellations, we may find someth ing that will connect itself with the symbols of the Ancient Mysteries and of Masonry . It is to be noticed that when the Sun is in a particular constellation, no part of that constella tion will be seen, except just before sunrise and just after sunset; and then only the edge of it: but the constellations opposite to it will be visible. When the Sun is in Taurus, Page 325 of 621"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike for example, that is, when Taurus sets with the Sun, Scorpio rises as he sets, and continues visible throughout the night. And if Taurus rises and sets with the Sun to-da y, he will, six months hence, rise at sunset and set at sunrise; for the stars thus gain on the Sun two hours a month. Going back to the time when, watched by the Chaldæan shepherds, and the husbandm en of Ethiopia and Eg ypt, \"The milk-white Bull with golden horns \"Led on the new-born year,\" we see in the neck of TAURUS, the Pleiades, and in his face the Hyades, \"which Grecia from their showering na mes,\" and of whom the brilliant Aldebarán is the chief; while to the southwe stward is that most splendid of all the constellat ions, Orion, with Betelgueux in his right shoulder, Bellatr ix in his left shoulder, Rigel on the left foot, and in his belt the three stars known as the Three Kings, and now as the Yard and Ell. Orion, ran the legend, persecuted the Pleiades; and to save them from his fury, Jupiter placed them in the Heavens, where he still pursues the m, but in vain. They, with Arcturus and the Bands of Orion, are mentioned in the Book of Job. They are usually called the Seven Stars, and it is said there were seven, before the fall of Tro y; though now onl y six are visible. The Pleiades were so named from a Greek word signify ing to sail . In all ages they have been observed for signs and season s. Virgil says that the sailors gave names to \"the Pleiades, Hyades, and the Northern Car: Pleiadas, Hyada s, Claramque Lycaonis Arcton .\" And Palinurus, he says, Arcturum, pluviasque Hyadas, Geminosque Triones, Armatumque auro circumspicit Oriona , – studied Arcturus and the rainy Hyades and the Twin Triones, and Orion cinctured with gold. Taurus was the prince and leader of the celesti al host for mor e than two thousand ye ars; and when his head set with the Sun about the last of May , the Scorpion was seen to rise in the South-east. The Pleiades were someti mes called Vergiliæ , or the Virgins of Spring; because the Sun entered this cluster of stars in the season of blossoms. Their Syrian name was Succoth , or Succothbeneth , derived from a Chaldæan word signify ing to speculate or observe. The Hyades are five stars in the form of a V, 11° southeast of the Pleiades. The Greeks counted them as seven. When the Vernal Equinox was in Taurus, Aldebarán led up the starry host; and as he rose in the East, Aries was about 27° high. When he was close upon the meridian, the Heavens presented their most magnif icent appearance. Capella was a little further from the meridian, to the north; and Orion still further from it to the southward. Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux had clim bed about halfway from the horizon to the mer idian. Regulus had ju st risen upon the eclipt ic. The Virgin still lingered below the horizon. Fomalh aut was halfwa y to the m eridian in the Southwest; and to the Northwest were the brilli ant constella tions, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Andromeda ; while the Pleiades had just passed the mer idian.

When Aldebarán rose in the East, the Three Kings in Orion followed him; and as Taurus set, the Scorpion, by whose sting it was said Orion died, rose in the East. Orion rises at noon about the 9th of March. His rising was acco mpanied with great rains and storms, and it beca me very terrible to marin ers. In Boötes, called by the ancient Greeks Lycaon , from lukos , a wolf, and by the Hebrews, Caleb Anubach, the Barking Dog, is the Great Star ARCTURUS, w hich, when Taurus opened the year, corresponded with a season remarkab le for its great heat. Next comes GEMINI, the Twins, two human figures, in the heads of which are the bright Stars CASTOR and P OLLUX, the Dioscuri, and the Cabiri of Samothra ce, patrons of navigation ; while South of Pollux are the brillian t Stars SIRIU S and PROCYON, the greater and lesser D og: and still further South, Canopus, in the Ship Argo. Sirius is apparentl y the largest and brightest Star in the Heavens. When the Vernal Equinox was in Taurus, he rose heliacall y, that is, just before the Sun, when, at the Summ er Solstice, the Sun entered Leo, about the 21st of June, fifteen days previous to the swelling of the Nile. The heliaca l rising of Canopus was also a precursor of the rising of the Nile. Procyon was the forerunner of Sirius, and rose before him. There are no importan t Stars in CANCER. In the Zodiacs of Esne and Dendera, and in most of the astrological remains of Egy pt, the sign of this constella tion was a beetle ( Scarabæus ), which thence became sacred, as an embl em of the gate through which souls descended from Heaven. In the crest of Cancer is a cluster of Stars formerl y called Præsepe , the Manger, on each side of which is a small Star, the two of which were called Aselli little asses. In Leo are the splendid Stars, REGULU S, directl y on the eclipt ic, and DE NEBOLA in the Lion's tail. Southeast of Regulus is the fine Star COR HY DRÆ. The comba t of Hercules with the Nemæan lion was his first labor. It was the first sign into which the Sun pas sed, after falling below the Summer Solstice; from which ti me he struggled to re-ascend. The Nile overflowed in this sign. It stands first in the Zodiac of Dendera, and is in all the Indian and Eg yptian Zodiacs. In the left hand of VIR GO (Isis or Ceres) is the beautiful Star SPIC A Virginis, a little South of the ecliptic. VINDEMIATRIX, of less magnitud e, is in the right arm; and Northwest of Spica, in Boötes (the husbandman, Osiris), is the splendid star ARCTURUS. The division of the first Decan of the Virgin, Aben Ezra says, represents a beautiful Virgin with flowing hair, sitting in a chair, with two ears of corn in her hand, and suckling an infant. In an Arabian MS. in the Ro yal Library at Paris, is a picture of the Twelve Signs. That of Virgo is a y oung girl with an infant by her side. Virgo was I sis; and her representation, carrying a child (Horus) in her arms, exhibited in her te mple, was Page 327 of 621"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike accompanied by this inscription: \"I AM ALL THAT IS, TH AT WAS, AN D THAT SHALL BE; and the fruit which I brought forth is the Sun.\" Nine months after the Sun enters Virgo, he reaches the Twins. When Scorpio begins to rise, Orion sets: when Scorpio comes to the m eridian, Leo begins to set, T yphon reigns, Osiris is slain, and Isis (the Virgin) his sister and wife, follows him to the tomb, weeping. The Virgin and Boötes, setting heliacall y at the Autumna l Equinox, delivered the world to the wintry constellat ions, and introduced into it the genius of Evil, represented by Ophiucus, the Serpent. At the moment of the Winter Solstice, the Virgin rose heliacall y ( with the Sun), having the Sun (Horu s) in her bosom. In LIBRA are four Stars of the second and third m agnitude, which we shall mention hereafter. They are Zuben-es-Cham ali, Zuben-el- Gemabi, Zuben-hak- rabi, and Zuben-el- Gubi. Near the last of these is the brilliant and mal ign Star, ANTARES in Scorpio. In SCOR PIO, ANT ARES, of the 1st magn itude, and remarkab ly red, was one of the four great Stars, FO MALHA UT, in Cetus, ALDEBAR AN in Taurus, REGULUS in Leo, and ANTARES, that formerl y answered to the Solstitial and Equinoct ial points, and were much noticed by astrono mers. This sign was someti mes represented by a Snake, and sometimes by a Crocodile, but generall y by a Scorpion, which last is found on the Mithriac Monuments, and on the Zodiac of Dendera. It was considered a sign accursed, and the entrance of the Sun into it commenced the reign of T yphon. In Sagittarius, Capricornus, and Aquarius there are no Stars of importan ce. Near Pisces is the brilliant Star FO MALHA UT. No sign in the Zodiac is considered of more malignant influence than this. It was deem ed indicativ e of Violenc e and Death . Both the Syrians and Eg yptians abstained from eating fish, out of dread and abhorrence; and when the latter would represent anything as odious, or express hatred by Hierogly phics, they painted a fish. In Auriga is the bright Star CAPELLA, which to the Egyptians never set. And, circling ever round the North Pole are Seven Stars, kno wn as Ursa Ma jor, or the Great Bear, which have been an object of universal observation in all ages of the world. They were venerated alike by the Priests of Bel, the Magi of Persia, the Shepherds of Chaldea, and the Phœnician navigators, as well as by the astronomers of Egypt. Two of them, MERAK and D UBHE, alwa ys point to the North Pole. The Phœnicians and Eg yptians, says Eusebius, were the first who ascribed divinity to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and regarded them as the sole causes of the production and destruction of all beings. From them vent abroad over all the world all known opinions as to the generation and descent of the Gods. O nly the Hebrews looked be yond the visible world to an invisible Creator. All the rest of the world regarded as Gods those luminous bodies that blaze in the fir mament, offered them sacrifices, bowed down before them, and raised neither their souls nor their worship above the visible heavens.

The Canaanites consecrated horses and chariots to the Sun. The inhabitants of Emesa in Phœnicia adored hi m under the name of Elagabalus; and the Sun, as Hercules, was the great Deity of the T yrians. The Syrians worshipped, with fear and dread, the Stars of the Constellat ion Pisces, and consecrated images of them in their temples. The Sun as Adonis was wor shipped in Byblos and about Mount Libanus. There was a magn ificent Temple of the Sun at Palm yra, which was pillaged by the soldiers of Aurelian, who rebuilt it and dedicated it anew. The Pleiades, under the name of Succoth-Beneth, were worshipped b y the Babylonian colonists who settled in the countr y of the Samarit ans. Saturn, under the name of Remphan, was worshipped a mong the Copts. The planet Jupiter was worshipped as Bel or Baal; Mars a s Malec, Melech, or Moloch; Venus as As htaroth or Astarte, and Mercur y as Nebo, among the Syrians, Assyrians, Phœnicians, and Canaanites. Sanchoniathon says that the earliest Phœnicians adored the Sun, whom they deemed sole Lord of the Heavens; and honored him, under the name of BEEL- SAMIN, signif ying King of Heaven . They raised colu mns to the elements, fire, and air or wind, and wor shipped them; and Sabæism, or the worship of the Stars, flourished everywhere in Babylonia. The Arabs, under a sk y always clear and serene, adored the Sun, M oon, and Stars. A bulfaragius so informs us, and that each of the twelve Arab Tribes invoked a particular Star as its Patron. The Tribe Hamyar was consecrated to the Sun, the Tribe Cennah to the Moon; the Tribe Misa was under the protection of the beautiful Star in Taurus, Aldebarán; the Tribe Tai under that of Canopus; the Tribe Kais, of Sirius; the Tribes Lacham us and Idamus, of Jupiter; the Tribe Asad, of Mercur y; and so on.

Shahristan, an Arabic author, sa ys that the Arabs and Indians before his ti me had temp les dedicated to the seven Planets. Abulfaragius says that the seven great primitive nations, from whom all others descended, the Persians, Chaldæans, Greeks, Eg yptians, Turks, Indians, and Chinese, all originall y were Sabæists, and worshipped the Stars. The y all, he says, like the Chaldæans, prayed, turning toward the North Pole. Three times a day, at Sunrise, Noon, and Sun set, bowing themselves three times before the Sun. The y invoked the Stars and the Intelligences which inhabited them, offered the m sacrifices, and called the fixed stars and planets gods. P hilo says that the Chaldæans regarded the stars as sovereign arbiters of the order of the world, and did not look beyond the visible causes to any invisible and intel lectual being. They regarded NATURE as the great divinity, that exercised its powers through the action of its parts, the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Fixed Stars, the successive revolutions of the seasons, and the comb ined action of Heaven and Earth. The great feast of the Sabæan s was when the Sun reached the Vernal Equinox: and the y had five other feasts, at the times when the five minor planets entered the signs in which the y had their exaltat ion. Diodorus Siculus informs us that the Egyptians recognized two great Divinities, primary and eternal, the Sun and Moon, which the y thought governed the world, and from which everything receives its nourishment and growth: that on them depended all the great work of generation, and the perfection of all effects produced in nature. We know that the two great Divinities of Egypt were Osiris and Isis, the greatest agents of nature; according to Page 329 of 621"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike some, the Sun and Moon, and according to others, Heaven and Earth, or the active and passive principles of generation. And we learn from Porphy ry that Chæremon, a learned priest of Eg ypt, and man y other learned men of that nation, said that the Egyptians recognized as gods the stars composing the zodiac, and all those that by their rising or setting marked its divisions; the subdivisions of the signs into decans, the horoscope and the stars that presided therein, and which were called Potent Chiefs of Heaven: that considering the Sun as the Great God, Architect, and Ruler of the World, they explained not onl y the fable of Osiris and Isis, but generall y all their sacred legends, b y the stars, by their appearance and disappearance, by their ascension, by the phases of the moon, and the increase and dim inution of her light; by the march of the sun, the division of time and the heavens into two parts, one assigned to darkness and the other to light; by the Nile and, in fine, by the whole round of ph ysical causes. Lucian tells us that the bull Apis, sacred to the Egyptians, was the im age of the celestia l Bull, or Taurus; and that Jupiter Ammon, horned like a ram, was an image of the constella tion Aries. Arid Cle mens of Alexandria assures u s that the four principal sacred animals, carried in their processions, were emble ms of the four sign s or cardinal points which fixed the season s at the equinoxes and solstices, and divided into four parts the yearly march of the sun. The y worshipped fire also, and water, and the Nile, which river they styled Father, Preserver of Eg ypt, sacred em anation from the Great God Osiris; and in their hymns in which they called it the god crowned with millet (which grain, represented by the pschent , was part of the head-dress of their kings), bringing with him abundance. The other ele ments were also revered by them: and the Great Gods, who se names are found inscribed on an ancient column, are the Air, Heaven, the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, Night, and Day . And, in fine, as Eusebius says, they regarded the Universe as a great Deity, composed of a great numb er of gods, the different parts of itself. The same worship of the Heavenly Host extended into every part of Europe, into Asia Minor, and among the Turks, Scy thians, and Tartars. The ancient Persians adored the Sun as Mithras, and also the Moon, Venus, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water; and, having no statues or altars, they sacrificed on high places to the Heavens and to the Sun. On seven ancient pyrea they burned incense to the Seven Planets, and considered the elements to be divinities. In the Zend- Avesta we find invocations addressed to Mithras, the stars, the elements, trees, mount ains, and ever y part of nature. The Celestial Bull is invoked there, to which the Moon unites herself; and the four great stars, Taschter, Satevis, Haftorang, and Venant, the great Star Rapitan, and the other constellat ions which watch over the different portions of the earth. The Magi, like a multitude of ancient nations, worshipped fire, above all the other ele ments and powers of nature. In India, the Ganges and the Indus were worshipped, and the Sun was the Great Divinit y. They worshipped the Moon also, and kept up the sacred fire. In Ceylon, the Sun, Moon, and other planets were worshipped: in Sumatr a, the Sun, called Iri, and the Moon, called Handa. And the Chinese built Temples to Heaven, the Earth, and genii of the air, of the water, of the mounta ins, and of the stars, to the sea-dragon, and to the planet Mars. Page 330 of 621"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The celebrated Labyrinth was built in honor of the Sun; and its twelve palaces, like the twelve superb columns of the Te mple at Hieropolis, covered with sy mbols relating to the twelve signs and the occult qualities of the elements, were consecrated to the twelve gods or tutelar y genii of the signs of the Zodiac. The figure of the p yramid and that of the obelisk, resembl ing the shape of a flam e, caused these monu ments to be consecrated to the Sun and to Fire. And Timæus of Locria says: \"The equilatera l triangle enters into the composi tion of the p yramid, which has four equal faces and equal angles, and which in this is like fire, the most subtle and mobile of the ele ments.\" They and the obelisks were erected in honor of the Sun, termed in an inscription upon one of the latter, translated by the Egyptian Hermapion, and to be found in Am mianus Marcellinus, \"Apollo the strong, Son of God, He w ho mad e the world, true Lord of the diade ms, who po ssesses Egy pt and fills it with His glory .\" The two most famous divisions of the Heavens, b y seven, which is that of the planets, and by twelve, which is that of the signs, are found on the religious monum ents of all the people of the ancient world. The twelve Great Gods of Egypt are met with everywhere. They were adopted by the Greeks and Romans; and the latter assigned one of them to each sign of the Zodiac. Their images were seen at Athens, w here an altar was erected to each; and they were painted on the porticos. The People of the North had their twelve Azes , or Senate of twelve great gods, of whom Odin was chief. The Japanese had the same number, and like the Egyptians divided them into classes, seven, who were the most ancient, and five, afterward added: both of which numbers are well known and consecrated in Masonry. There is no more striking proof of the universal adoration paid the stars and constella tions, than the arrange ment of the Hebrew camp in the Desert, and the allegor y in regard to the twelve Tribes of Israel, ascribed in the Hebrew legends to Jacob. The Hebrew camp was a quadrilat eral, in sixteen divisions, of which the central four were occupied by images of the four ele ments. The four divisions at the four angles of the quadrilatera l exhibited the four signs that the astrologers called fixed, and which the y regard as subject to the influence of the four great Royal Stars, Regulus in Leo, Aldebarán in Taurus, A ntares in Scorpio, and Fomalh aut in the mou th of Pisces, on which falls the water poured out by Aquarius; of which constellations the Scorpion was represented in the Hebrew blazonry by the Celestial Vulture or Eagle, that rises at the same time with it and is its paranate llon. The other signs were arranged on the four faces of the quadrilatera l, and in the paralle l and interior divisions. There is an astonishing coincidence between the character istics assigned by Jacob to his sons, and those of the signs of the Zodiac, or the planets that have their domicile in those signs. Reuben is comp ared to running water, unstable, and that cannot excel; and he answers to Aquarius, his ensign being a man. The water poured out by Aquarius flows toward the South Pole, and it is the first of the four Ro yal Signs, ascending from the Winter Solstice. The Lion (Leo) is the device of Judah ; and Jacob compar es him to that animal, whose constella tion in the Heavens is the do micile of the Sun; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah; by whose grip, when that of apprentice and that of fellow-craft, – of Aquarius at the Winter Page 331 of 621"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Solstice and of Cancer at the Vernal Equinox, – had not succeeded in raising him, Kh r m ū ū was lifted out of the gra ve. Ephraim , on whose ensign appears the Celestial Bull, Jacob compares to the ox. Dan , bearing as his device a Scorpion, he compar es to the Cerastes or horned Serpent, synonymous in astrologica l language with the vulture or pouncing eagle; and which bird was often substituted on the flag of Dan, in place of the veno mous scorpion, on account of the terror which that reptile inspired, as the s ymbol of Typhon and his ma lign influences; wherefore the Eagle, as its paranatellon, that is, rising and setting at the same time with it, was naturall y used in its stead. Hence the four fa mous figures in the sacred pictures of the Jews and Christians, and in Roy al Arch Masonr y, of the Lion, the Ox, the Man, and the Eagle, the four creatures of the Apocalypse, copied there from Ezekiel, in who se reveries and rhapsodies they are seen revolving around blazing circles. The Ram, domicile of Mars, chief of the Celestia l Soldier y and of the twelve Signs, is the device of Gad , whom Jacob characteri zes as a warrior, chief of his arm y. Cancer, in which are the stars termed Aselli , or littl e asses, is the device of the flag of Issachar , whom Jacob compar es to an ass. Capricorn, of old represented with the tail of a fish, and called by astronomers the Son of Neptune, is the device of Zebulon , of whom Jacob say s that he dwells on the shore of the sea. Sagittarius, chasing the Celestial Wolf, is the emblem of Benjamin , whom Jacob co mpares to a hunter: and in that constella tion the Romans placed the domicile of Diana the huntress. Virgo, the domicile of Mercury , is borne on the flag of Naphtali , whose eloquence and agility Jacob magnif ies, both of which are attribut es of the Courier of the Gods. And of Simeon and Levi he speaks as united, as are the two fishes that make the Constellation Pisces, which is their armorial emblem. Plato, in his Republic, followed the divisions of the Zodiac and the planets. So also did Lycurgus at Sparta, and Cecrops in the Athenian Comm onwealth. Chun, the Chinese legislator, divided China into twelve Tcheou, and speciall y designated twelve mountains. The Etruscans divided themselves into twelve Cantons. Romulus appointed twelve Lictors. There were twelve tribes of Ishmael and twelve disciples of the Hebrew Reformer. The New Jeru salem of the Apocal ypse has twelve gates. The Souciet, a Chinese book, s peaks of a palace composed of four buildings, whose gates looked toward the four corners of the world. That on the East was dedicated to the new moons of the months of Spring; that on the West to those of Autumn; that on the South to those of Summer; and that on the North to those of Winter: and in this palace the Emp eror and his grandees sacrificed a lamb, the animal that represented the Sun at the Vernal Equinox. Among the Greeks, the mar ch of the Choruses in their theatres represented the move ments of the Heavens and the planets, and the Strophe and Anti-Strophe imitated, Aristoxenes says, the mov ements of the Stars. The number five was sacred among the Chinese, as that of the planets other than the Sun and Moon. Astrology consecrated the numbers twelve, Page 332 of 621"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike seven, thirt y, and three hundred and sixt y; and every where seven , the number of the planets, was as sacred as twelve , that of the signs, the months, the oriental cycles, and the sections of the horizon. We shall speak more at large hereafter, in another Degree, as to these and other numbers, to which the ancients ascribed mysterious powers. The Signs of the Zodiac and the Stars appeared on man y of the ancient coins and med als. On the public seal of the Locrians, Ozoles was Hesperus, or the planet Venus. On the medals of Antioch on the Orontes was the ram and crescent; and the Ram was the special Deity of Syria, assigned to it in the division of the earth among the twelve signs. On the Cretan coins was the Equinoctial Bull; and he also appeared on those of the Mamer tins and of Athens. Sagittarius appeared on those of the Persians. In India the twelve signs appeared upon the ancient coins. The Scorpion was engraved on the med als of the Kings of Comagena, and Capricorn on those of Zeugma, Anazorba, and other cities. On the medals of Antoninus are found nearl y all the signs of the Zodiac. Astrology was practised among all the ancient nations. In Egypt, the book of Astrology was borne reverentia lly in the religious processions; in which the few sacred animals were also carried, as emble ms of the equinoxes and solstices. The same science flourished among the Chaldæans, and over the whole of Asia and Africa. When Alexander invaded India, the astrologers of the Oxydraces came to him to disclose the secrets of their science of Heaven and the Stars. The Brahm ins whom Apollonius consulted, taught him the secrets of Astronom y, with the cere monies and pray ers whereby to appease the gods and learn the future from the stars. In China, astrolog y taught the mode of governing the State and families. In Arabia it was deemed the moth er of the sciences; and old libraries are full of Arabic books on this pretended science. It flourished at Rome. Constantine had his horoscope drawn b y the astrologer Valens. It was a science in the middle ages, and even to this day is neither forgotten nor unpractised. Catherine de Medici was fond of it. Louis XIV. consulted his horoscope, and the learned Casini commenced his career as an astrologer. The ancient Sabæans established feasts in honor of each planet, on the da y, for each, when it entered its place of exaltat ion , or reached the particular degree in the particul ar sign of the zodiac in which astrology had fixed the place of its exaltat ion; that is, the place in the Heavens where its influence was suppo sed to be greatest, and where it acted on Nature with the greatest energy. The place of exalta tion of the Sun wa s in Aries, because, reaching that point, he awakens all Nature, and warms into life all the germs of vegetation ; and therefore his most solemn feast among all nations, for man y years before our Era, was fixed at the time of his entrance into that sign. In Eg ypt, it was called the Feast of Fire and Light. It was the Passover, when the Paschal La mb was slain and eaten, among the Jews, and Neurouz among the Persians. The Romans preferred the place of domicile to that of exaltation; and celebrated the feasts of the planets under the signs that were their houses . The Chaldæans, whom, and not the Egyptians, the Sabæans followed in this, preferred the places of exaltat ion. Saturn, from the length of ti me required for his apparent revolution, was considered the most remote, and the Moon the nearest planet. After the Moon came Mercur y and Venu s, then the Sun, and then Mars, J upiter, and Saturn. Page 333 of 621"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike So the risings and settings of the Fixed Stars, and their conjunctions with the Sun, and their first appearance as they emerged from his rays, fixed the epochs for the feasts instituted in their honor; and the Sacred Calendars of the ancients were regulated accordingl y. In the Roman games of the circus, celebrated in honor of the Sun and of entire Nature, the Sun, Moon, Planets, Zodiac, Elements, and the most apparent parts and potent agents of Nature were personified and represented, and the courses of the Sun in the Heavens were imitated in the Hippodrome ; his chariot being drawn by four horses of different colors, representing the four elem ents and seasons. The courses w ere from East to West, like the circuits round the Lodge, and seven in number, to correspond with the number of planets. The movem ents of the Seven Stars that revolve around the pole were also represented, as were those of Capella, which b y its heliacal rising at the mo ment when the Sun reached the Pleiades, in Taurus, announced the commencement of the annual revolution of the Sun. The intersection of the Zodiac by the colures at the Equinoctial and Solstitial points, fixed four periods, each of which has, by one or more nations, and in some cases by the same nation at different periods, been taken for the com mencement of the y ear. Some adopted the Vernal Equinox, because then da y began to prevail over night, and light gained a victory over darkness. Somet imes the Summ er Solstice was preferred; because then day attained its max imum of duration, and the acme of its glor y and perfection. In Egypt, another reason was, that then the Nile began to over- flow, at the heliacal rising of Sirius. Some preferred the Autumnal Equinox, because then the harvests were gathered, and the hopes of a new crop were deposited in the bosom of the earth. And some preferred the Winter Solstice, because then, the shortest da y having arrived, their length commenced to increase, and Light began the career destined to end in victor y at the Vernal Equinox. The Sun wa s figurative ly said to die and be born again at the Winter Solstice; the games of the Circus, in honor of the invincible God-Sun, were then celebrated, and the Roman year, established or reform ed by Numa, commenced. Many peoples of Italy commenced their year, Macrobius say s, at that time; and represented by the four ages of man the gradual succession of periodica l increase and diminution of day, and the light of the Sun; likening him to an infant born at the Winter Solstice, a young man at the Vernal Equinox, a robust man at the Summer Solstice, and an old m an at the Autumna l Equinox. This idea was borrowed from the Egyptians, who adored the Sun at the Winter Solstice, under the figure of an infant. The image of the Sign in which each of the four sea sons com menced, became the form under which was figured the Sun of that particular season. The Lion's skin was worn by Hercules; the horns of the Bull adorned the forehead of Bacchus; and the autumn al serpent wound its long folds round the Statue of Serapis, 2500 y ears before our era; when those Signs corresponded with the com mencement of the Seasons. When other constellat ions replaced them at those points, by means of the precession of the Equinoxes, those attributes were changed. Then the Ram furnished the horns for the head of the Sun, under the name of Jupiter Ammon. He was no longer born exposed to the waters of Aquarius, like Bacchus, nor enclosed in an urn like the God Canopus; but in the Stables of Augeas or the Celestia l Goat. He then comple ted his triumph, mounted on an ass, in the constellat ion Cancer, which then occupied the Solstitial point of Summ er. Page 334 of 621"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Other attributes the images of the Sun borro wed from the constellations which, by their rising and setting, fixed the points of departure of the year, and the com mencements of its four principal divisions. First the Bull and afterward the Ram (called by the Persians the Lamb), was regarded as the regenerator of Nature, through his union with the Sun. Each, in his turn, was an emblem of the Sun overcom ing the winter darkness, and repairing the disorders of Nature, which every year was regenerated under these Signs, after the Scorpion and Serpent of Autumn had brought upon it barrenness, disaster, and darkness. Mithras wa s represented sitting on a Bull; and that animal was an imag e of Osiris: while the Greek Bacchus armed his front with its horns, and was pictured with its tail and feet. The Constellations also became noteworth y to the husbandman, which b y their rising or setting, at morning or evening, indicat ed the coming of this period of renewed fruitfulness and new life. Capella, or the kid Amalthe a, whose horn is called that of abundance, and whose place is over the equinoctial point, or Taurus; and the Pleiades, that long indicated the Season s, and gave rise to a multitude of poetic fables, were the most observed and most celebrat ed in antiquit y. The original Roman year commenced at the Vernal Equinox. July was formerl y called Quintilis , the 5th month, and Augu st Sextilis , the 6th, as September is still the 7th month, October the 8th, and so on. The Persians commenced their year at the same time, and celebrat ed their great feast of Neurouz when the Sun entered Aries and the Constellation Perseus rose, – Per seus, who first brought down to earth the heavenl y fire consecrated in their temples: and all the cere monies then practised reminded men of the renovation of Nature and the triumph of Ormuzd, the Light- God, over the powers of D arkness and Ahriman their Chief. The Legislator of the Jews fixed the com mencement of their year in the month Nisan, at the Vernal Equinox, at which season the Israelites marched out of Egy pt and were relieved of their long bondage; in commemoration of which Exodus, the y ate the Paschal Lamb at that Equinox. And w hen Bacchus and his arm y had long mar ched in burning deserts, the y were led by a Lamb or Ram into beautiful meadows, and to the Springs that watered the Temple of Jupiter Ammon. For, to the Arabs and Ethiopians, whose great Divinit y Bacchus was, nothing was so perfect a type of Elysium as a Countr y abounding in springs and rivulets. Orion, on the same meridian with the Stars of Taurus, died of the sting of the celestia l Scorpion, that rises when he sets; as dies the Bull of Mithras in Autumn: and in the Stars that correspond with the Autumna l Equinox we find those ma levolent genii that ever war against the Principle of good, and that take from the Sun and the Heavens the fruit- producing power that they communicate to the earth. With the Vernal Equinox, dear to the sailor as to the husbandman, came the Stars that, with the Sun, open navigation, and rule the stormy Seas. Then the Twins plunge into the solar fires, or disappear at setting, going down with the Sun into the bosom of the waters. And these tutelary Divinities of mariners, the Dioscuri or Chief Cabiri of Samothrac e, sailed with Jason to possess themselves of the golden- fleeced ram, or Aries, whose rising in the Page 335 of 621"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike morning announced the Sun' s entry into Taurus, w hen the Serpent- bearer Jason rose in the evening, and, in aspect with the Dioscuri, was deemed their brother. And Orion, son of Neptune, and most potent controller of the te mpest-tortured ocean, announcing someti mes calm and sometimes tempest, rose after Taurus, rejoicing in the forehead of the new ye ar. The Summer Solstice was not less an importan t point in the Sun's march than the Vernal Equinox, especiall y to the Egyptians, to whom it not only marked the end and term of the increasing length of the days and of the dominat ion of light, and the maximum of the Sun' s elevation; but also the annual recurrence of that phenomenon peculiar to Egypt, the rising of the Nile, which, ever acco mpanying the Sun in his cour se, seemed to rise and fall as the days grew longer and shorter, being lowest at the Winter Solstice, and highest at that of Summer. Thus the Sun seem ed to regulate its swelling; and the time of his arrival at the solstitial point being that of the first rising of the Nile, was selected by the Egyptians as the beginning of a year which the y called the Year of God, and of the Sothiac Period, or the period of Sothis, the Dog-Star, who, rising in the morn ing, fixed that epoch, so import ant to the people of Egypt. This year was also called the Heliac, that is the Solar y ear, and the Canicular year; and it consisted of three hundred and sixt y-five days, without intercala tion; so that at the end of four y ears, or of four ti mes three hundred and sixty-five days, making 1460 da ys, it needed to add a da y, to make four compl ete revolutions of the Sun. To correct this, some Nations mad e every fourth ye ar consist, as we do now, of 366 da ys: but the Egyptians preferred to add nothing to the year of 365 da ys, which, at the end of 120 years, or of 30 ti mes 4 years, was short 30 da ys or a month ; that is to say, it required a month more to compl ete the 120 revolutions of the Sun, though so many were counted, that is, so man y years. Of course the commencement of the 121st y ear would not correspond with the Sum mer Solstice, but would precede it by a month : so that, when the Sun arrived at the Solstitial point whence he at first set out, and whereto he must needs return, to mak e in realit y 120 ye ars, or 120 compl ete revolutions, the first month of the 121st y ear would have ended. Thus, if the com mencement of the y ear went back 30 day s every 120 years, this commencement of the y ear, continuing to recede, would, at the end of 12 tim es 120 ye ars, or of 1460 y ears, get back to the Solstitia l point, or primi tive point of departure of the period. The Sun would then have mad e but 1459 revolutions, though 1460 were counted; to make up which, a year more would need to be added. So that the Sun would not have made his 1460 revolutions until the end of 1461 ye ars of 365 da ys each, – each revolution being in realit y not 365 da ys exactly, but 365¼. This period of 1461 y ears, each of 365 da ys, bringing back the commencement of the Solar year to the Solstitial point, at the rising of Sirius, after 1460 co mplete Solar revolutions, was called in Egypt the Sothiac period, the point of departure whereof was the Summer Solstice, first occupied by the Lion and afterward by Cancer, under which sign is Sirius, which opened the period. It was, says Porphyry, at this Solstitia l New M oon, acco mpanied by the rising of Seth or the Dog-Star, that the beginning of the y ear was fixed, and that of the generation of all things, or, as it were, the natal hour of the world. Not Sirius alone determined the period of the rising of the Nile. Aquarius, his urn, and the stream flowing from it, in opposition to the sign of the Summer Solstice then occupied by Page 336 of 621"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the Sun, opened in the evening the march of Night, and received the full Moon in his cup. Above him and with hi m rose the feet of Pegasus, struck wherewith the waters flow forth that the Muses drink. The Lion and the Dog, indicating, were suppo sed to cause the inundation, and so were worshipped. While the Sun passed through Leo, the waters doubled their depth; and the sacred fountains poured their streams through the heads of lions. Hydra, rising between Sirius and Leo, extended under three signs. Its head rose with Cancer, and its tail with the feet of the Virgin and the beginning of Libra; and the inundation continued while the Sun pas sed along its whole extent. The successive contest of light and darkness for the possession of the lunar disk, each being by turns victor and vanquished, exactly resembl ed what passed upon the earth by the action of the Sun and his jo urneys from one Solstice to the other. The lunary revolution presented the same periods of light and darknes s as the year, and was the object of the sane religious fictions. Above the Moon, Plin y said, every thing is pure, and filled with eternal light. There ends the cone of shadow w hich the earth projects, and which produces night; there ends the sojourn of night and darknes s; to it the air extends; but there we enter the pure substance. The Egyptians assigned to the Moon the dem iurgic or creative force of Osiris, who united himself to her in the spring, when the Sun com municated to her the principles of generation which she afterward disseminated in the air and all the elements. The Persians considered the Moon to have been impregna ted by the Celestial Bull, first of the signs of spring. In all ages, the Moon has been suppo sed to have great influence upon vegetation, and the birth and growth of anim als; and the belief is as widely entertain ed now as ever, and that influence regarded as a mysterious and inexplicable one. Not the astrologers alone, but Naturalists like Pliny, Philosophers like Plutarch and Cicero, Theologians like the Egyptian Priests, and Metaph ysicians like Proclus, believed firmly in these lunar influences. \"The Egyptians,\" says Diodorus Siculus, \"acknowledged two great gods, the Sun and Moon, or O siris and Isis, w ho govern the world and regulate its admin istration by the dispensation of the season s... Such is the nature of these two great Divinities, that they impress an active and fecundating force, b y which the generation of beings in effected; the Sun, by heat and that spiritual principle that forms the breath of the winds; the Moon by humidity and dry ness; and both b y the forces of the air which they share in common. By this beneficial influence everything is born, grows, and vegetates. Wherefore this whole huge body, in which nature resides, is ma intained by the combined action of the Sun and Moon, and their five qualities, the principles spiritual, fiery, dry, humid, and airy.\" So five primitive powers, ele ments, or elemen tary qualities, are united with the Sun and Moon in the Indian theolog y: air, spirit, fire, water, and earth: and the same five ele ments are recognized by the Chinese. The Phœnicians, like the Egyptians, regarded the Sun and Moon and Stars as sole causes of generation and destruction here below. The Moon, like the Sun, changed continuall y the track in which she crossed the Heavens, moving ever to and fro between the upper and lower li mits of the Zodiac; and her different places, phases, and aspects there, and her relations with the Sun and the constellations, have been a fruitful source of mythological fables. Page 337 of 621"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike All the planets had what astrology termed their houses , in the Zodiac. The House of the Sun was in Leo, and that of the Moon in Cancer. Each other planet had two signs; Mercury had Gemini and Virgo; Venus, Taurus and Libra; Mars, Aries and Scorpio; Jupiter, Pisces and Sagittarius; and Saturn, Aquarius and Capricornus. From this distribution of the signs also came many mythological emblems and fables; as also man y came from the places of exaltation of the planets. Diana of Ephesus, the Moon, wore the image of a crab on her bosom, because in that sign was the Moon' s domicile; and lions bore up the throne of Horns, the Eg yptian Apollo, the Sun personified, for a like reason: while the Egyptians consecrated the taurifor m scarabæus to the Moon, because she had her place of exaltat ion in Taurus; and for the same reason Mercury is said to have presented Isis with a helm et like a bull's head. A further division of the Zodiac was of each sign into three parts of 10° each, called Decans, or, in the whole Zodiac, 36 parts, among which the seven planets were apportioned anew, each planet having an equal number of Decans, except the first, which, opening and closing the series of planets five times repeated, necessaril y had one Decan more than the others. This subdivision was not invented until after Aries opened the Vernal Equinox; and accordingl y Mars, having his house in Aries, opens the series of decans and closes it; the planets following each other, five times in succession, in the following order, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury , the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, etc.; so that to each sign are assigned three planets, each occup ying 10 degrees. To each Decan a God or Genius was assigned, making thirty-six in all, one of whom, the Chaldæans said, came down upon earth every ten days, remained so many days, and re-ascended to Heaven. This division is found on the Indian sphere, the Persian, and that Barbaric one which Aben Ezra describes. Each genius of the Decans had a name and special characteristi cs. They concur and aid in the effects produced b y the Sun, Moon, and other planets charged with the ad ministra tion of the world: and the doctrine in regard to the m, secret and august as it was held, was considered of the gravest impor tance; and its principles, Firmicus says, were not entrusted by the ancients, inspired as they were b y the Deity, to any but the Initiates, and to them only with great reserve, and a kind of fear, and when cautiousl y enveloped with an obscure veil, that they might not come to be known b y the profane. With these Decans were connected the paranatellons or those stars outside of the Zodiac, that rise and set at the same moment with the several divisions of 10° of each sign. A s there were ancient ly only forty-eight celestial figures or constellations, of which twelve were in the Zodiac, it follows that there were, outside of the Zodiac, thirty-six other asterisms, paranatellons of the several thirty-six Decans. For exampl e, as when Capricorn set, Sirius and Procy on, or Canis Maj or and Canis Minor, rose, they were the Paranatellons of Capricorn, though at a great distance from it in the heavens. The rising of Cancer was known from the setting of Corona Borealis and the rising of the Great and Litt le Dog, its three paranatel lons. The risings and settings of the Stars are always spoken of as connected with the Sun. In that connection there are three kinds of them, cosmica l, achronical, and heliaca l, important to be distinguished by all who would understand this ancient learning.

It is therefore necessary , in order to know his place in the Zodiac, to observe stars that rise just before or set just after him. A Star that is in the East when night com mences, and in the West when it ends, is said to rise and set achronically . A Star so rising or setting was in oppo sition to the Sun, rising at the end of evening twilight, and setting at the beginning of morning twilight, and this happened to each Star but once a year, because the Sun moves from West to East, with reference to the Stars, one degree a day. When a Star rises as night ends in the morning, or sets as night commences in the evening, it is said to rise or set heliacal ly , because the Sun ( Helios ) seems to touch it with his luminous atmospher e. A Star thus reappears after a disappearance, often, of several months, and thenceforward it rises an hour earlier each day, graduall y emerging from the Sun's rays, until at the end of three mon ths it precedes the Sun six hours, and rises at midnight. A Star sets heliacall y, when no longer rem aining visible above the western horizon after sunset, the day arrives when they cease to be seen setting in the West. The y so rema in invisible, until the Sun pas ses so far to the Eastward as not to eclipse them with his light; and then the y reappear, but in the East, about an hour and a half before sunrise: and this is their heliacal rising. In this interval, the cosmic al rising and setting take place. Besides the relations of the constellations and their paranatellons with the houses and places of exaltat ion of the Planets, and with their places in the respective Signs and Decans, the Stars were suppo sed to produce different effects according as they rose or set, and according as they did so either cosmically, achronical ly, or heliaca lly; and also according to the different seasons of the year in which 'these phenomena occurred; and these differences were carefull y marked on the old Calendars; and many things in the ancient allegories are referable to them. Another and most important division of the Stars was into good and bad, beneficent and malevolent. With the Persians, the former, of the Zodiacal Constellat ions, were from Aries to Virgo, inclusive; and the latter from Libra to Pisces, inclusive. Hence the good Angels and Genii, and the bad Angels, Devs, Evil Genii, Devils, Fallen Angels, Titans, and Giants of the Mythology. The other thirt y-six Constellat ions were equall y divided, eighteen on each side, or, with those of the Zodiac, twenty -four. Thus the symbolic Egg, that issued from the mouth of the invisible Egyptian God KNEP H; known in the Grecian Mysteries as the Orphic Egg; from which issued the God CHUMONG of the Coresians, and the Egyptian OSIRIS, and PHANES, God and Principle of Light; from which, broken b y the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, the world emerged ; and which the Greeks placed at the feet of BACC HUS TA URI-CORN US; the Magian Egg of ORMUZD, from which came the Amshaspands and Devs; was divided into two halves, and equally apportioned between the Good and Evil Constellations and Angels. Those of Spring, as for exa mple Aries and Taurus, Auriga and Capella, were the beneficent stars; and those of A utumn, as the Balance, Scorpio, the Serpent of Ophiucus, and the Dragon of the Hesperides, were types and subjects of the Evil Principle, and regarded as malevolent Page 339 of 621"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike causes of the ill effects experienced in Autumn and Winter. Thus are explained the mysteries of the journeyings of the human soul through the spheres, when it descends to the earth by the Sign of the Serpent, and returns to the Empire of light by that of the Lamb or Bull. The creative action of Heaven was manifest ed, and all its demiurgi c energy developed, most of all at the Vernal Equinox, to which refer all the fables that typify the victor y of Light over Darkness, b y the triumphs of Jupiter, Osiris, Ormuzd, and Apollo. Alwa ys the triumphant god takes the form of the Bull, the Ram, or the La mb. Then Jupiter wrests from Typhon his thunderbolts, of which that malign ant Deity had posses sed himself during the Winter. Then the God of Light overwhel ms his foe, pictured as a huge Serpent. Then Winter ends; the Sun, seated on the Bull and acco mpanied by Orion, blazes in the Heavens. All nature rejoices at the victory; and Order and Harmon y are ever ywhere re-established, in place of the dire confusion that reigned while gloo my Typhon domineered, and Ahriman prevailed against Ormuzd. The universal Soul of the World, motive power of Heaven and of the Spheres, it was held, exercises its creative energy chiefly through the medium of the Sun, during his revolution along the signs of the Zodiac, with which signs unite the paranatellons that modify their influence, and concur in furnishing the symbolic attributes of the Great Luminary that regulates Nature and is the depository of her greatest powers. The action of this Universal Soul of the World is display ed in the move ments of the Spheres, and above all in that of the Sun, in the successions of the risings and settings of the Stars, and in their periodical returns. By these are explainable all the metamorphoses of that Soul, personified as Jupiter, as Bacchus, as Vishnu, or as Buddha, and all the various attribut es ascribed to it; and also the worship of those anima ls that were consecrated in the ancient Temples, representatives on earth of the Celestial Signs, and supposed to receive by transmission from them the rays and emanat ions which in them flow from the Universal Soul. All the old Adorers of Nature, the Theologians, Astrologers. and Poets, as well as the most distinguished Philosophers, supposed that the Stars were so man y animated and intelligen t beings, or eternal bodies, active causes of effect here below, animated by a living principle, and directed by an intell igence that was itself but an emana tion from and a part of the life and universal intell igence of the world: and we find in the hierarchi cal order and distribution of their eternal and divine Intelligen ces, known by the nam es of God s, Angels, and Genii, the same distributions and the same divisions as those b y which the ancients divided the visible Universe and distributed its parts. And the famous divisions by seven and by twelve, appertain ing to the planets and the signs of the zodiac, is ever ywhere found in the hierarchic al order of the Gods, and Angels, and the other Ministers that are the depositaries of that Divine Force which moves and rules the world. These, and the other Intellig ences assigned to the other Stars, have absolute dominion over all parts of Nature; over the elements, the ani mal and vegetable kingdoms, over man and all his actions, over his virtues and vices, and over good and evil, which divide between them his life. The passions of his soul and the ma ladies of his body , – these and the entire man are dependent on the heavens and the genii that there inhabit, who preside at his birth, control his fortunes during life, and receive his soul or active and intellig ent part when it is Page 340 of 621"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike to be re-united to the pure life of the lofty Stars. And all through the great body of the world are disseminated portions of the universal Soul, impressing movem ent on ever ything that seems to move of itself, giving life to the plants and trees, directing by a regular and settled plan the organization and developm ent of their germs, imparting constant mobility to the running waters and main taining their eternal motion, impelling the winds and changing their direction or stilling them, calming and arousing the ocean, unchaining the storms, pouring out the fires of volcanoes, or with earthquakes shaking the roots of huge mountains and the foundations of vast continents; by means of a force that, belonging to Nature, is a mystery to man. And these invisible Intelligenc es, like the stars, are marshall ed in two great divisions, under the banners of the two Principles of Good and Evil, Light and Darknes s; under Ormuzd and Ahriman, Osiris and T yphon. The Evil Principle was the motive power of brute matter; and it, personified as Ahriman and Typhon, had its hosts and armi es of Dev s and Genii, Fallen Angels and Malevolent Spirits, who waged continual wage with the Good Principle, the Principle of Emp yreal Light and Splendor, Osiris, O rmuzd, Jupiter or Dionusos, with 'his bright hosts of Amshaspands, Izeds, Angels, and Archangels; a warfare that goes on from birth until death, in the soul of every man that lives. We have heretofore, in the 24th Degree, recited the principal incidents in the legend of Osiris and Isis, and it remains but to point out the astronomi cal phenomena which it has converted into mythological facts. The Sun, at the Vernal Equinox, was the fruit- compel ling star that by his warmth provoked generation and poured upon the sublunar y world all the blessings of Heaven; the beneficent god, tutelar y genius of universal vegetation, that communicates to the dull earth new activi ty, and stirs her great heart, long chilled by Winter and his frosts, until from her bosom burst all the greenness and perfume of spring, making her rejoice in leafy forests and grassy lawns and flower- enamelled meadows, and the promise of abundant crops of grain and fruits and purple grapes in their due season. He was then called Osiris, Husband of Isis, G od of Cultivat ion and Benefactor of Men, pouring on them and on the earth the choicest blessings within the gift of the Divinit y. Opposed to him was Typhon, his antagonist in the Egyptian mythology, as Ahriman was the foe of Ormuzd, the Good P rinciple, in the theolog y of the Persians. The first inhabitan ts of Egy pt and Ethiopia, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, saw in the Heavens two first eternal causes of things, or great Divinities, one the Sun, whom they called Osiris, and the other the Moon, whom they called Isis; and these they considered the causes of all the generations of earth. This idea, we learn from Eusebius, was the same as that of the Phœnicians. On these two great Divinities the administration of the world depended. All sublunar y bodies received from them their nourishmen t and increase, during the annual revolution which the y controlled, and the different seasons into which it was divided. To Osiris and Isis, it was held, were owing civili zation, the discovery of agriculture, laws, arts of all kinds, religious worship, temp les, the invention of letters, astronom y, the gymnastic arts, and music; and thus the y were the universal benefactors. Osiris travelled to Page 341 of 621"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike civilize the countries which he passed through, and communicate to them his valuable discoveries. He built cities, and taught men to cultiva te the earth. Wheat and wine were his first presents to men. Europe, Asia, and Africa partook of the blessings which he communicated, and the most remote regions of India remembered him, and clai med him as one of their great gods. You have learned how Typhon, his brother, slew him. His body was cut into pieces, all of which were collected by Isis, except his organs of generation, which had been thrown into and devoured in the waters of the river that every year fertilized Egypt. The other portions were buried by Isis, and over the m she erected a tomb. Thereafter she rema ined single, loading her subjects with blessings. She cured the sick, restored sight to the blind, made the paralytic whole, and even raised the dead. From her Horus or Apollo learned divination and the science of med icine. Thus the Egyptians pictured the beneficent action of the two lumin aries that, from the bosom of the elements, produced all animals and men, and all bodies that are born, gro w, and die in the eternal circle of generation and destruction here below. When the Celestia l Bull opened the new ye ar at the Vernal Equinox, Osiris, united with the Moon, com municated to her the seeds of fruitfulness which she poured upon the air, and therewith impregnat ed the generative principles which gave activi ty to universal vegetation. Apis, represented by a bull, was the living and sensible image of the Sun or Osiris, when in union with Isis or the Moon at the Vernal Equinox, concurring with her in provoking everything that lives to generation. This conjunction of the Sun with the Moon at the Vernal Equinox, in the constellation Taurus, required the Bull Apis to have on his shoulder a mark resemb ling the Crescent Moon. A nd the fecundating influence of these two lum inaries was expressed b y images that would now be deem ed gross and indecent, but which then were not misunderstood. Everything good in Nature com es from Osiris, – order, harmon y, and the favorable temperature of the season s and celestial periods. From Typhon come the stormy passions and irregular impulses that agitate the brute and ma terial part of man; maladies of the body, and violent shocks that injure the health and derange the system; inclement weather, derange ment of the seasons, and eclipses. Osiris and Ty phon were the Ormuzd and Ahriman of the Persians; principles of good and evil, of light and darkness, ever at war in the administration of the Universe. Osiris was the im age of generative power. This was expressed by his symbolic statues, and by the sign into which he entered at the Vernal Equinox. He especial ly dispensed the humid principle of Nature, generative element of all things; and the Nile and all moisture were regarded as eman ations from him, without which there could be no vegetation. That Osiris and Isis were the Sun and Moon, is attested by many ancient writers; by Diogenes Laertius, Plutarch, Lucian, Suidas, Macrobius, Martianus Capella, and others. His power wa s symbolized by an Eye over a Sceptre. The Sun was termed by the Greeks the Eye of Jupiter, and the Eye of the World; and his is the All-Seeing Eye in our Lodges. The oracle of Claros st yled him King of the Stars and of the Eternal Fire, that en-genders the year and the seasons, dispenses rain and winds, and brings about daybreak and night. Page 342 of 621"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike And Osiris was invoked as the God that resides in the Sun and is enveloped by his rays, the invisible and eternal force that modifies the sublunary world b y means of the Sun. Osiris was the same God known as Bacchus, Dionusos, and Serapis. Serapis is the author of the regularit y and harmon y of the world. Bacchus, jointl y with Ceres (identified by Herodotus with Isis) presides over the distribution of all our blessings; and from the two emanates everything beautiful and good in Nature. One furnishes the germ and principle of every good; the other receives and preserves it as a deposit; and the latter is the function of the Moon in the theolog y of the Persians. In each theolog y, Persian and Eg yptian, the Moon acts directl y on the earth; but she is fecundated, in one by the Celestia l Bull and in the other b y Osiris, with whom she is united at the Vernal Equinox, in the sign Taurus, the place of her exaltation or greatest influence on the earth. The force of Osiris, sa ys Plutarch, is exercised through the Moon. She is the passive cause relative ly to him, and the active cause relativel y to the earth, to which she transmi ts the germs of fruitfulness received from him. In Egypt the earliest movement in the waters of the Nile began to appear at the Vernal Equinox, when the new Moon occurred at the entrance of the Sun into the constellation Taurus; and thus the Nile was held to receive its fertil izing power from the combined action of the equinoctia l Sun and the new M oon, me eting in Taurus. Osiris was often confounded with the Nile, and Isis with the earth; and Osiris was deemed to act on the earth, and to transmit to it his eman ations, through both the Moon and the Nile; whence the fable that his generative organs were thrown into that river. Typhon, on the other hand, was the principle of aridit y and barrenness; and by his mut ilation of Osiris was meant that drought which caused the Nile to retire within his bed and shrink up in Autumn. Elsewhere than in Egypt, Osiris was the s ymbol of the refreshing rains that descend to fertilize the earth; and Typhon the burning winds of Autumn; the stormy rains that rot the flowers, the plants, and leaves; the short, cold days; and ever ything injurious in Nature, and that produces corruption and destruction. In short, T yphon is the principle of corruption, of darknes s, of the lower world from which come earthquakes, tumultuous corn-mo tions of the air, burning heat, lightning, and fier y meteors, and plague and pestilenc e. Such too was the Ahriman of the Persians; and this revolt of the Evil Principle against the Principle of Good and Light, has been represented in every cosmogon y, under many varying forms. Osiris, on the contrar y, by the intermediation of Isis, fills the material world with happiness, purity, and order, by which the harmon y of Nature is main tained. It was said that he died at the Autumna l Equinox, when Taurus or the Pleiades rose in the evening, and that he rose to life again in the Spring, when vegetat ion was inspired with new activi ty. Of course the two sign s of Taurus and Scorpio will figure most largely in the mythological history of Osiris, for the y marked the two equinoxes, 2500 ye ars before our Era; and next to them the other constellations, near the equinoxes, that fixed the limits of the duration of the fertiliz ing action of the Sun; and it is also to be remarked that Venus, the Goddess of Generation, has her domici le in Taurus, as the Moon has there her place of exaltat ion. Page 343 of 621"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike When the Sun was in Scorpio, Osiris lost his life, and that fruitfulness which, under the form of the Bull, he had com municated, through the Moon, to the Earth. Typhon, his hands and feet horrid with serpents, and whose habitat in the Eg yptian planisphere was under Scorpio, confined hi m in a chest and flung him into the Nile, under the 17th degree of Scorpio. Under that sign he lost his life and virilit y; and he recovered them in the Spring, when he had connection with the Moon. When he entered Scorpio, his light diminished, Night reassumed her domin ion, the Nile shrunk within its banks, and the earth lost her verdure and the trees their leaves. Therefore it is that on the Mithriac Monuments, the Scorpion bites the testicles of the Equinoctial Bull, on which sits Mithras, the Sun of Spring and God of Generation; and that, on the same monum ents, we see two trees, one covered with young leaves, and at its foot a little bull and a torch burning; and the other loaded with fruit, and at its foot a Scorpion, and a torch reversed and extinguished. Ormuzd or Osiris, the beneficent Principle that gives the world light, was personified by the Sun, apparent source of light. Darknes s, personified by Typhon or Ahriman, was his natural enemy. The Sages of Egy pt described the necessary and eternal rivalry or opposition of these principles, ever pursuing one the other, and one dethroning the other in every annual revolution, and at a particular period, one in the Spring under the Bull, and the other in Autumn under the Scorpion, b y the legendar y history of Osiris and T yphon, detailed to us b y Diodorus and Sy nesius; in which history were also personified the Stars and constellations Orion, Capella, the Twins, the Wolf, Sirius, and Hercules, whose risings and settings noted the advent of one or the other equinox. Plutarch gives us the positions in the Heavens of the Sun and Moon, at the mo ment when Osiris was murdered by Typhon. The Sun, he sa ys, was in the Sign of the Scorpion, which he then entered at the Autumna l Equinox. The Moon was full, the adds; and consequentl y, as it rose at sunset, it occupied Taurus, which, opposite to Scorpio, rose as it and the Sun sank together, so that she wa s then found alone in the sign Taurus, where, six months before, she had been in union or conjunction with O siris, the Sun, receiving from him those germs of universal fertiliza tion which he comm unicated to her. It was the sign through which Osiris first ascended into his emp ire of light and good. It rose with the Sun on the day of the Vernal Equinox; it remained six months in the luminous hemisphere, ever preceding the Sun and above the horizon during the day; until in Autumn, the Sun arriving at Scorpio, Taurus was in comp lete opposition with him, rose when he set, and comp leted its entire course above the horizon during the night; presiding, by rising in the evening, over the com mencement of the long nights. Hence in the sad cere monies commemorating the death of Osiris, there was borne in procession a golden bull covered with black crape, image of the darkness into which the fam iliar sign of Osiris wa s entering, and which was to spread over the Northern regions, w hile the Sun, prolonging the nights, was to be absent, and each to remain under the dominion of Typhon, Principle of Evil and Darkness. Setting out from the sign Taurus, I sis, as the Moon, went seeking for Osiris through all the superior signs, in each of which she beca me full in the successive months from the Autumna l to the Vernal Equinox, without finding him in either. Let us follow her in her allegori cal wanderings. Page 344 of 621"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Osiris was slain b y Typhon his rival, with whom conspired a Queen of Ethiopia, by whom, says Plutarch, were designated the winds. The paranatellons of Scorpio, the sign occupied by the Sun when Osiris was slain, were the Serpents, reptiles which sup-plied the attributes of the Evil Genii and of Typhon, who himself bore the form of a serpent in the Eg yptian planisphere. And in the division of Scorpio is also found Cassiopeia, Queen of Ethiopia, whose setting brings storm y winds. Osiris descended to the shades or infernal regions. There he took the name of Serapis, identical with Pluto, and assumed his nature. He was then in conjunction with Serpentarius, identica l with Æsculap ius, whose form he took in his passage to the lower signs, where he takes the names of Pluto and Ades. Then Isis wept for the death of Osiris, and the golden bull covered with crape was carried in procession. Nature mourned the impending loss of her Summer glories, and the advent of the empire of night, the withdrawing of the waters, made fruitful by the Bull in Spring, the cessation of the winds that brought rains to swell the Nile, the shortening of the days, and the despoiling of the earth. Then Taurus, directl y opposite the Sun, entered into the cone of shadow which the earth projects, by which the Moon is eclipsed at full, and with which, making night, the Bull rises and descends as if covered with a veil, while he remains above our horizon. The body of Osiris, enclosed in a chest or coffin, was cast into the Nile. Pan and the Satyrs, near Chemm is, first discovered his death, announced it by their cries, and everywhere created sorrow and alar m. Taurus, with the full Moon, then entered into the cone of shadow, and under hi m was the Celestial River, most properly called the Nile, and below, Perseus, the God of Chem mis, and Auriga, leading a she-goat, hi mself identic al with Pan, whose wife Aiga the she-goat was st yled. Then Isis went in search of the bod y. She first m et certain children who had seen it, received from them their informa tion, and gave the m in return the gift of divination. The second full Moon occurred in Gemini, the Twins, who presided over the oracles of Didymus, and one of w hom was Apollo, the God of Divination. She learned that Osiris had, through mistake, had connection with her sister Nephte, which she discovered by a crown of leaves of the m elilot, which he had left behind him. Of this connection a child was born, whom Isis, aided by her dogs, sought for, found, reared, and attached to herself, by the nam e of Anubis, her faithful guardian. The third full Moon occurs in Cancer, domici le of the Moon. The paranatel lons of that sign are, the crown of Ariadne or Proserpine, made of leaves of the me lilot, Procyon and Canis Major, one star of which was called the Star of Isis, while Sirius himself was honored in Egypt under the name of Anubis. Isis repaired to Byblos, and seated herself near a fountain, where she was found b y the women of the Court of a King. S he was induced to visit his Court, and became the nurse of his son. The fourth full Moon was in Leo, domici le of the Sun, or of Adonis, King of Byblos. The paranatellons of this sign are the flowing water of Aquarius, and Cepheus, King of Ethiopia, called Regulus, or simpl y The King. Behind hi m rise Cassiopeia his Page 345 of 621"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike wife, Queen of Ethiopia, Andromeda his daughter, and Perseu s his son-in-law, all paranatel lons in part of this sign, and in part of Virgo. Isis suckled the child, not at her breast, but with the end of her finger, at night. She burned all the mortal parts of its body, and then, taking the shape of a swallow, she flew to the great column of the palace, made of the ta marisk- tree that grew up round the coffin containing the bod y of Osiris, and within which it was still enclosed. The fifth full Moon occurred in Virgo, the true image of Isis, and which Eratosthenes calls by that name. It pictured a woman suckling an infant, the son of Isis, born near the Winter Solstice. This sign has for paranatel lons the mast of the Celestial Ship, and the swallow-tailed fish or swallow above it, and a portion of Perseus, son-in-law of the King of Ethiopia. Isis, having recovered the sacred coffer, sailed from Byblos in a vessel with the eldest son of the King, toward Boutos, where Anubis was, having charge of her son H orus; and in the morning dried up a river, whence arose a strong wind. Landing, she hid the coffer in a forest. Typhon, hunting a wild boar b y moonlight, discovered it, recognized the body of his rival, and cut it into fourteen pieces, the number of days between the full and new Moon, and in every one of which days the Moon loses a portion of the light that at the commencement filled her whole disk. The sixth full Moon occurred in Libra, over the divisions separating which from Virgo are the Celestia l Ship, Perseus, s on of the King of Ethiopia and Boötes, said to have nursed Horus. The river of Orion that sets in the morning is also a paranatellon of Libra, as are Ur sa Major, the Great Bear or Wild Boar of Erymanthus, and the Dragon of the North Pole, or the celebra ted Python from which the attributes of Typhon were borrowed. All these surround the full Moon of Libra, last of the Superior Signs, and the one that precedes the new M oon of Spring, about to be reproduced in Taurus, and there be once more in conjunction with the Sun. Isis collects the scattered fragments of the body of Osiris, buries them, and consecrates the phallus, carried in pomp at the Pamylia , or feasts of the Vernal Equinox, at which time the congress of Osiris and the Moon was celebrated. Then Osiris had returned from the shades, to aid Horus his s on and Isis his wife against the forces of Ty phon. He thus reappeared, say some, under the form of a wolf, or, others sa y, under that of a horse. The Moon, fourteen days after she is full in Libra, arrives at Taurus and unites herself to the Sun, whose fires she thereafter for fourteen days continues to accumu late on her disk from new M oon to full. Then she unites with herself all the mon ths in that superior portion of the world where light always reigns, with harmon y and order, and she borrows from him the force which is to destroy the ger ms of evil that Typhon had, during the winter, planted everywhere in nature. This passage of the Sun into Taurus, w hose attribut es he assumes on his return from the lower he misphere or the shades, is marked by the rising in the evening of the Wolf and the Centaur, and by the heliac al setting of Orion, called the Star of Horns, and which thenceforward is in con junction with the Sun of Spring, in his triu mph over the darkness or T yphon. Isis, during the absence of Osiris, and after she had hidden the coffer in the place where Typhon found it, had rejoined that malign ant enemy; indignant at which, Horns her son deprived her of her ancient diadem, when she rejoined Osiris as he was about to attack Typhon: but Mercur y gave her in its place a helmet shaped like the head of a bull. Then Page 346 of 621"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Horus, as a might y warrior, such as Orion wa s described, fought with and defeated Typhon; who, in the shape of the Serpent or Dragon of the Pole, had assailed his father. So, in Ovid, Apollo destroy s the same Python, when Io, fascinated by Jupiter, is metamorphosed into a cow, and placed in the sign of the Celestia l Bull, where she becomes Isis. The equinoctial year ends at the mo ment when the Sun and Moon, at the Vernal Equinox, are united with Orion, the Star of Horus, placed in the Heavens under Taurus. The new M oon beco mes young again in Taurus, and sho ws herself as a crescent, for the first time, in the next sign, Gemin i, the domicile of Mercury . Then Orion, in conjunction with the Sun, with whom he rises, precipit ates the Scorpion, his rival, into the shades of night, causing hi m to set whenever he himself reappears on the eastern horizon, with the Sun. Day lengthens and the germs of evil are by degrees eradicated: and Horus (from Aur , Light) reigns triumphan t, symbolizing, by his succession to the character istics of Osiris, the eternal renewal of the Sun's youth and creative vigor at the Vernal Equinox. Such are the coinciden ces of astronomi cal phenomena with the legend of Osiris and Isis; sufficing to show the origin of the legend, overloaded as it became at length with all the ornamentation natural to the poetica l and figurative genius of the Orient. Not onl y into this legend, but into those of all the ancient nations, enter the Bull, the Lamb, the Lion, and the Scorpion or the Serpent; and traces of the worship of the Sun ye t linger in all religions. Everywhere, even in our Order, survive the equinocti al and solstitial feasts. Our ceilings still glitter with the greater and lesser lum inaries of the Heavens, and our lights, in their number and arrange ment, have astronom ical references. In all churches and chapels, as in all Pagan te mples and pagodas, the altar is in the East; and the iv y over the east windows of old churches is the Hedera Helix of Bacchus. Even the cross had an astronom ical origin; and our Lodges are full of the ancient symbols. The learned author of the Sabæan Researches, Landseer, advances another theory in regard to the legend of Osiris; in which he makes the constellat ion Boötes pla y a leading part. He observes that, as none of the stars were visible at the same time with the Sun, his actual place in the Zodiac, at any given time, could only be ascertained by the Sabæan astronom ers by their observations of the stars, and of their heliacal and achronical risings and settings. There were man y solar festivals among the Sabæans, and part of them agricultur al ones; and the conco mitant signs of those festivals were the risings and settings of the stars of the Husbandman, Bear-driver, or Hunter, BOÖTES. His stars were, among the Hierophants, the established nocturnal indices or signs of the Sun' s place in the eclipt ic at different seasons of the y ear, and the festivals were na med, one, that of the Aphanism or disappearance ; another, that of the Zetesis , or search, etc., of Osiris or A donis, that is, of Boötes . The returns of certain stars, as connected with their concom itant seasons of s pring (or seed- time) and harvest, seem ed to the ancients, who had not y et discovered that gradual change, resulting from the apparent movement of the stars in longitude, which has been ter med the precession of the equinoxes, to be eternal and im mutable; and those periodical returns were to the initia ted, even more than to the vulgar, celestial oracles, announcing the approach of those importan t changes, upon w hich the prosperit y, and even the ver y existence of man must ever depend; and the oldest of the Sabæan constellat ions seem to have been, an Page 347 of 621"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike astronom ical Priest , a King , a Queen , a Husbandman , and a Warrior ; and these more frequentl y recur on the Sabæan cy linders than an y other constellat ions whatever. The King was Cepheus or Chepheus of Ethiopia: the Husband man , Osiris , Bacchus , Sabazeus , Noah or Boötes . To the latter sign, the Egyptians were nationall y, traditional ly and habitual ly grateful; for they conceived that from Osiris all the greatest of terrestrial enjoyments were derived. The stars of the Husbandman were the signal for those successive agricultur al labors on which the annual produce of the soil depended; and the y came in consequence to be considered and hailed, in Egypt and Ethiopia, as the genial stars of terrestrial productiveness; to which the oblations, pra yers, and vow s of the pious Sabæan were regularl y offered up. Landseer says that the stars in Boötes, reckoning down to those of the 5th magnitud e inclusive, are twenty- six , which, seeming achronica lly to disappear in succession, produced the fable of the cutting of Osiris into twenty -six pieces by Typhon. There are more stars than this in the constellat ion; but no more that the ancient votaries of Osiris, even in the clear atmosphere of the Sabæan cli mates, could observe without telescopes. Plutarch says Osiris was cut into fourteen pieces: Diodorus, into twenty- six ; in regard to which, and to the whole legend, Landseer's ideas, var ying from those co mmonly entertained, are as follows: Typhon, Landseer thinks, was the ocean , which the ancients fabled or believed surrounded the Earth, and into which all the stars in their turn appear successivel y to sink; [perhaps it was DARKNES S personified, which the ancients called TYPHON. He was hunting b y moonlight, says the old legend, when he me t with Osiris]. The ancient Saba must have been near latitud e 15° north. Axoum is nearly in 14°, and the Western Saba or Meroe is to the north of that. Forty-eight centuries ago, Aldebarán, the leading star of the y ear, had, at the Vernal Equinox, attain ed at daylight in the morning, an elevation of about 14 degrees, sufficient for him to have ceased to be combu st , that is, to have emerged from the Sun's rays, so as to be visible. The ancients allowed twelve days for a star of the first magnitud e to emerge from the solar rays; and there is less twilight, the further South we go. At the same period, too, Cynosura was not the pole-star, but Alpha Draconis was; and the stars rose and set with very different degrees of obliquit y from those of their present risings and settings. By having a globe constructed with circum volving poles, capable of any adjustment with regard to the colures, Mr. Landseer ascertain ed that, at that remote period, in lat. 15° north, the 26 stars in Boötes, or 27, including Arcturus, did not set anchronical ly in succession; but several set simu ltaneousl y in couples, and six by threes simu ltaneousl y; so that, in all, there were but fourteen separate settings or disappearances, corresponding with the fourteen pieces into which Osiris was cut, according to Plutarch. Kappa, Iota, and Theta, in the uplifted western hand, disappeared together, and last of all. They really skirted the horizon; but were invisible in that low latitud e, for the three or four day s mentioned in some of the versions; while the Zetesis or search was proceeding, and the women of Phœnicia and Jerusalem sat weeping for the Wonder, Thammuz; after which they immediately reappeared, below and to the eastward of α Draconis.

And precisel y at the mo ment of the heliaca l rising of Arcturus, also rose Spica Virginis. One is near the midd le of the Hu sbandman, and the other near that of the Virgin; and Arcturus ma y have been the part of Osiris which Isis did not recover with the other pieces of the body. At Dedan and Saba it was thirty-six days, from the beginning of the aphanis m , i.e. , the disappearances of these stars, to the heliacal rising of Aldebarán. During these da ys, or forty at Medina, or a few more at Babylon and By blos, the stars of the Husbandm an successivel y sank out of sight, during the crepusculum or short-lived morning twilight of those Southern climes. They disappear during the glancings of the dawn, the special season of ancient sidereal observation. Thus the forty days of mourning for Osiris were measured out by the period of the departure of his Stars. When the last had sunken out of sight, the vernal season was ushered in; and the Sun arose with the splendid Aldebarán, the Tauric leader of the Hosts of Heaven; and the whole East rejoiced and kept holiday. With the exception of the Stars χ, ι and δ, Bo ötes did not begin to reappear in the Eastern quarter of the Heavens till after the lapse of about four months. Then the Stars of Taurus had declined Westward, and Virgo wa s rising heliacall y. In that latitude, also, the Stars of Ursa Ma jor [termed ancient ly the Ark of Osiris] set; and Benetnasch, the last of them, returned to the Eastern horizon, with those in the head of Leo, a little before the Sum mer Solstice. In about a month, followed the Stars of the Husbandman; the chief of the m, Ras, Mirach, and Arcturus, being very nearly simultan eous in their heliaca l rising. Thus the Stars of Boötes rose in the East immediately after Vindem iatrix, and as if under the genial influence of its rays; he had his annual career of prosperit y; he revelled oriental ly for a quarter of a year, and attained his merid ian altitude with Virgo; and then, as the Stars of the Water- Urn rose, and Aquarius began to pour forth his annual deluge, he declined Westward, preceded by the Ark of Osiris. In the East, he was the sign of that happiness in which Nature, the great Goddes s of passive production, rejoiced. Now, in the West, as he declines toward the Northwe stern horizon, his generative vigor graduall y abates; the Solar y ear grows old; and as his Stars descend beneath the Western Wave, Osiris dies, and the world mourns. The Ancient Astronomers saw all the great Symbols of Masonry in the Stars. Sirius still glitters in our Lodges as the Blazing Star, ( l’Etoil e Flamboyante ). The Sun is still symbolized by the point within a Circle; and, with the Moon and Mercur y or Anubis, in the three Great Lights of the Lodge. Not onl y to these, but to the figures and numbers exhibited by the Stars, were ascribed peculiar and divine powers. The veneration paid to numbers had its source there. The three Kings in Orion are in a straight line, and equidistant from each other, the two extre me Stars being 3° apart, and each of the three distant from the one nearest it 1° 30'. And as the number three is peculiar to apprentices, so the straight line is the first principle of Geometr y, having length but no breadth, and being but the extension of a point, and an e mblem of Unity , and thus of G ood, as the divided or Page 349 of 621"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike broken line is of Dualit y or Evil. Near these Stars are the Hyades, five in number, appropriate to the Fellow-Craft; and close to them the Pleiades, of the master's number, seven ; and thus these three sacred numbers, consecrated in Masonry as they were in the Pythagorean philosoph y, always appear together in the Heavens, when the Bull, emblem of fertility and production, glitters among the Stars, and Aldebarán leads the Hosts of Heaven ( Tsbauth ). Algenib in Perseus and Almaa ch and Algol in Andromeda form a right- angled triangle, illustrat e the 47th problem, and displa y the Grand Master's s quare upon the skies. Denebola in Leo, Arcturus in Boötes, and Spica in Virgo form an equilater al triangle, universal emblem of Perfection, and the Deity with His Trinit y of Infinite Attributes, Wisdom, Power, and Harmon y; and that other, the generative, preserving, and destro ying Powers. The Three Kings form, with Rigel in Orion, two triangles included in one: and Capella and Menkalina in Auriga, with Bellatrix and Betelgueux in Orion, form two isosceles triangles with β Tauri, that is equidistant from each pair; while the first four mak e a right-angled parallelogr am, – the oblong square so often mention ed in our Degrees. Julius Firm icus, in his description of the Mysteries, says, \"But in those funerals and lamentations which are annuall y celebrat ed in honor of O siris, their defenders pretend a physical reason. The y call the seeds of fruit, Osiris; the Earth, Isis; the natural heat, Typhon: and because the fruits are ripened by the natural heat, and collected for the life of man, and are separated from their marriage to the earth, and are sown again when Winter approaches, this the y would have to be the death of Osiris: but when the fruits, by the genial fostering of the earth, begin again to be generated by a new procreation, this is the finding of Osiris.\" No doubt the decay of vegetation and the falling of the leaves, emblems of dissolution and evidences of the action of that Power that changes Life into Death, in order to bring Life again out of Death, were regarded as sign s of that Death that seemed coming upon all Nature; as the springing of leaves and buds and flowers in the spring was a sign of restoration to life: but these were all secondary , and referred to the Sun as first cause. It was his figurative death that was mourned, and not theirs; and that with that death, as with his return to life, many of the stars were connected. We have alread y alluded to the relations which the twelve signs of the Zodiac bear to the legend of the Master's Degree. Some other coinciden ces may have sufficient interest to warrant mention. Khir-Om was assailed at the East, West, and South Gates of the Temple. The two equinoxes were called, we have seen, by all the Ancients, the Gates of Heaven, and the Syrians and Egyptians considered the Fish (the Constellation near Aquarius, and one of the Stars whereof is Foma lhaut) to be indicat ive of violence and death. Khir-Om lay several days in the grave; and, at the Winter Solstice, for five or six da ys, the length of the days did not perceptib ly increase. Then, the Sun com mencing again to clim b Northward, as Osiris wa s said to arise from the dead, so Khir-Om was raised, by the powerful attraction of the Lion (Leo), who waited for him at the Summer Solstice, and drew him to himse lf.

We search in vain in the Hebrew or A rabic for the names Jubelo , Jubela , and Jubelum . They embod y an utter absurdity , and are capable of no explanat ion in those languages. Nor are the names Gibs , Gravelot , Hobhen , and the like, in the Ancient and Accepted Rite, any more plausible, or better referable to any ancient language. But when, by the precession of the Equinoxes, the Sun wa s in Libra at the Autumnal Equinox, he met in that sign, w here the reign of Typhon commenced, three Stars forming a triangle, Zuben- es Chamali in the West, Zuben-Hak-Rabi in the East, and Zuben-El-Gubi in the South, the latter immediately below the Tropic of Capricorn, and so within the real m of Darkness. From these names, those of the murder ers have perhaps been corrupted. In Zuben-Hak- Rabi we may see the original of Jubelum Akirop; and in Zuben-El- Gubi, that of Jubelo Gibs: and time and ignorance may even have transmuted the words Es Chamal i into one as little like them as Gravelot. Isis, the Moon personified, sorrowing sought for her husband. Nine or twelve Fellow- Crafts (the Rites var y as to the number), in white aprons, were sent to search for Khir-Om, in the Legend of the Master's Degree; or, in this Rite, the Nine Knights Elu. Along the path that the Moon travels are nine conspicuous Stars, b y which nautical men determ ine their longitude at Sea; – Arietis, Aldebarán, Pollux, Regulus, Spica Virginis, Antares, Altair, Fomalhaut, and Markab. These might well be said to acco mpany Isis in her search. In the York Rite, twelve Fellow-Crafts were sent to search for the bod y of Khir-Om and the murderers. Their number corresponds with that of the Pleiades and Hyades in Taurus, among which Stars the Sun was found when Light began to prevail over Darkness, and the Mysteries were held. These Stars, we have sho wn, received early and particular attention from the astronom ers and poets. The Pleiades were the Stars of the ocean to the benighted mariner; the. Virgins of Spring, heralding the season of blossoms. As six Pleiades onl y are now visible, the numb er twelve may have been obtained by them, with Aldebarán, and five far mor e brilliant Stars than any other of the Hyades, in the same region of the Heavens, and which were alwa ys spoken of in connection with the Pleiades; – the Three Kings in the belt of Orion, and Bellatr ix and Betelgueux on his shoulders; brightest of the flashing starr y hosts. \"Canst thou,\" ask s Job, \"bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion?\" A nd in the book of Amos we find these Stars connected with the victory of Light over Darkness: \"Seek Him,\" says that Seer, \"that maketh the Seven Stars (the fam iliar name of the Pleiades), and Orion, AND TUR NETH THE SH ADOW O F DEATH INTO MORNING.\" An old legend in Masonr y says that a dog led the Nine this to the cavern where Abiram was hid. Boötes was ancientl y called Caleb Anubach, a Barking Dog; and was personified in Anubis, who bore the head of a dog, and aided Isis in her search. Arcturus, one of his Stars, fier y red, as if fervent and zealous, is also connected by Job with the Pleiades and Orion. When Taurus opened the year, Arcturus rose after the Sun, at the time of the Winter Solstice, and seem ed searching him through the darknes s, until, sixty days afterward, he rose at the same hour, Orion then also, at the Winter Solstice, rose at noon, and at night seemed to be in search of the Sun.

They are Capella and Menkalina in the Charioteer, Aldebarán in Taurus, Bellatrix, Betelgueux, the Three Kings, and Rigel in Orion. Aldebarán passes the mer idian first, indicating his right to .his peculiar title of Leader . Nowhere in the heavens are there, near the same meridian, so man y splendid Stars. And close behind them, but further South, follows Sirius, the Dog-Star, who showed the nine Elus the way to the murderer's cave. Besides the division of the signs into the ascending and descending series (referring to the upward and downward progress of the soul), the latter from Cancer to Capricorn, and the former from Capricorn to Cancer, there was another division of them not less impor tant; that of the six superior and six inferior signs; the former, 2455 y ears before our era, from Taurus to Scorpio, and 300 y ears before our era, from Aries to Libra; and the latter, 2455 years B. C. from Scorpio to Taurus, and 300 ye ars B. C. from Libra to Aries; of which we have already spoken, as the two Hemispher es, or Kingdoms of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness; of Ormuzd and Ahriman among the Persians, and Osiris and T yphon among the Egyptians. With the Persians, the first six Genii, created by Ormuzd, presided over the first six signs, Aries, Taurus, Gem ini, Cancer, Leo, and Virgo: and the six evil Genii, or Dev s, created by Ahriman, over the six others, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. The soul was fortunate and happy under the Empire of the first six; and began to be sensible of evil, when it passed under the Balance or Libra, the seventh sign. Thus the soul entered the realm of Evil and Darkness when it passed into the Constellations that belong to and succeed the Autumna l Equinox; and it re-entered the realm of Good and Light, when it arrived, returning, at those of the Vernal Equinox. It lost its felici ty by means of the Balance, and regained it by means of the La mb. This is a necessary consequence of the premises; and it is confirm ed by the authorities and by emblems still extant. Sallust the Philosopher, speaking of the Feasts of Re joicing celebra ted at the Vernal Equinox, and those of Mourning, in memory of the rape of Proserpine, at the Autumna l Equinox, says that the former were celebrated, because then is effected, as it were, the return of the soul toward the Gods; that the time when the principle of Light recovered its superiorit y over that of Darkness, or day over night, was the most favorable one for souls that tend to re-ascend to their Principle; and that when Darknes s and the Night again become victors, was most favorable to the descent of souls toward the infernal regions. For that reason, the old astrologers, as Firmicus states, fixed the locality of the river Styx in the 8th degree of the Balance. And he thinks that by Styx was allegorica lly meant the earth. The Emperor Julian gives the same explanation, but more fully developed. He states, as a reason wh y the august My steries of Ceres and Proserpine were celebrated at the Autumnal Equinox, that at that period of the year men feared lest the impious and dark power of the Evil Principle, then com mencing to conquer, should do harm to their souls. The y were a precaution and means of safet y, thought to be necessar y at the moment when the God of Light was pas sing into the opposite or adverse region of the world; while at the Vernal Equinox there was less to be feared, because then that God, present in one portion of the Page 352 of 621"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike world, recalled souls to Him , he says, and showed Himself to be their Saviour . He had a little before developed that theological idea, of the attract ive force which the Sun exercises over souls, drawing the m to him and raising the m to his lu minous sphere. He attribut es this effect to him at the feasts of Aty s, dead and restored to life, or the feasts of Rejoicing, which at the end of three days succeeded the mourning for that death; and he inquires why those Mysteries were celebrated at the Vernal Equinox. The reason, he sa ys, is evident. As the sun, arriving at the equinoctial point of Spring, drawing nearer to us, increases the length of the days, that period seems most appropriate for those cere monies. For, besides that there is a great affinity between the substance of Light and the nature of the Gods, the Sun has that occult force of attraction, by which he draws matt er toward hi mself, by means of his warmth, making plants to shoot and grow, etc.; and why can he not, by the same divine and pure action of his ray s, attract and draw to him fortunate souls? Then, as light is analogous to the Divine Nature, and favorable to souls. struggling to return to their First Principle, and as that light so increases at the Vernal Equinox, that the days prevail in duration over the nights, and as the Sun has an attract ive force, besides the visible energy of his ra ys, it follows that souls are attracted toward the solar light. He does not further pursue the explanation; because, he says, it belongs to a mysterious doctrine, beyond the reach of the vulgar and known onl y to those who understand the mode of action of Deity, like the Chaldæan author whom he cites, who had treated of the M ysteries of Light, or the God with seven ra ys. Souls, the Ancients held, having em anated from the Principle of Light, partaking of its destiny here below, cannot be indifferent to nor unaffected by these revolutions of the Great Lumin ary, alternat ely victor and overcome during every Solar revolution. This will be found to be confir med by an examina tion of some of the S ymbols used in the Mysteries. One of the most famous of these was THE SERPENT, the peculiar Symbol also of this Degree. The Cosmogon y of the Hebrews and that of the Gnostics designated this reptile as the author of the fate of Souls. It was consecrated in the Mysteries of Bacchus and in those of Eleusis. Pluto overca me the virtue of Proserpine under the form of a serpent; and, like the Egyptian God Serapis, was alway s pictured seated on a serpent, or with that reptile entwined about hi m. It is found on the Mithriac Monuments, and supplied with attributes of Typhon to the Egyptians. The sacred basilisc, in coil, with head and neck erect, was the royal ensign of the Pharaohs. Two of them were entwined around and hung suspended from the winged Globe on the Eg yptian Monuments. On a tablet in one of the Tombs at Thebes, a God with a spear pierces a serpent's head. On a tablet from the Temple of Osiris at Philæ is a tree, with a man on one side, and a woman on the other, and in front of the woman an erect basilisc, with horns on its head and a disk between the horns. The head of Medu sa was encircled by winged snakes, which, the head remov ed, left the Hierogra m or Sacred Cypher of the Ophites or Serpent-worshippers. And the Serpent, in connection with the Globe or circle, is found upon the monum ents of all the Ancient Nations. Over Libra, the sign through which souls were said to descend or fall, is found, on the Celestia l Globe, the Serpent, grasped by Serpentarius, the Serpent- bearer. The head of the reptile is under Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown, called by Ovid, Libera , or Proserpine ; and the two Constellat ions rise, with the Balance, after the Virgin (or Isis), Page 353 of 621"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike whose feet rest on the eastern horizon at Sunrise on the day of the equinox. As the Serpent extends over both signs, Libra and Scorpio, it has been the gate through which souls descend, during the whole time that those two signs in succession mark ed the Autumnal Equinox. To this alluded the Serpent, which, in the Mysteries of Bacchus Saba-Zeus, was flung into the bosom of the Initia te. And hence came the enig matical expression, the Serpent engenders the Bull, and the Bull the Serpent ; alluding to the two ad-verse constellat ions, answering to the two equinoxes, one of which rose as the other set, and which were at the two points of the heavens through which souls passed, ascending and descending. By the Serpent of Autumn, souls fell; and they were regenerated again b y the Bull on which Mithras sate, and who se attributes Bacchus- Zagreus and the Egyptian Osiris assumed, in their Mysteries, wherein were represented the fall and regeneration of souls, by the Bull slain and restored to life. Afterward the regenerating Sun assumed the attribut es of Aries or the Lamb; and in the Mysteries of Ammon, souls were regenerated by passing through that sign, after having fallen through the Serpent. The Serpent-bearer, or Ophicus, was Æsculap ius, God of H ealing. In the Mysteries of Eleusis, that Constellation was placed in the eighth Heaven: and on the eighth day of those Mysteries, the feast of Æsculap ius was celebrat ed. It was also ter med Epidaurus, or the feast of the Serpent of Epidaurus. The Serpent was sacred to Æscul apius; and wa s connected in various wa ys with the mythological adventures of Ceres. So the libations to Souls, by pouring wine on the ground, and looking toward the two gates of Heaven, those of day and night, referred to the ascent and descent of Souls. Ceres and the Serpent, Jupiter Am mon and the Bull, all figured in the Mysteries of Bacchus. Suppose Aries, or Jupiter Ammon occupied by the Sun setting in the West; – Virgo (Ceres) will be on the Eastern horizon, and in her train the Crown, or Proserpine. Suppose Taurus setting; – then the Serpent is in the East; and reciprocal ly; so that Jupiter Ammon, or the Sun of Aries, causes the Crown to rise after the Virgin, in the train of which comes the Serpent. Place reciprocal ly the Sun at the other equinox, with the balance in the West, in conjunction with the Serpent under the Crown; and we shall see the Bull and the Pleiades rise in the East. Thus are explained all the fables as to the generation of the Bull by the Serpent and of the Serpent b y the Bull, the biting of the testicles of the Bull by the Scorpion, on the Mithriac Monuments; and that Jupiter made Ceres with child by tossing into her bosom the testicles of a Ra m. In the Mysteries of the bull-horned Bacchus, the officers held serpents in their hands, raised them above their heads, and cried aloud \"Eva!\" the generic oriental name of the serpent, and the particular name of the constellation in which the Persians placed Eve and the serpent. The Arabians call it Hevan , Ophiucus himself, Hawa , and the brillian t star in his head, Ras-al-Hawa . The use of this word Eva or Evoë caused Cle mens of Alexandria to say that the priests in the Mysteries invoked Eve , by whom evil was brought into the world.

In the Isiac Mysteries a basilisc twined round the handle of the mystic vase. The Ophites fed a serpent in a mysterious ark, from which they took him when the y celebrated the Mysteries, and allowed hi m to glide among the sacred bread. The Romans kept serpents in the Temples of Bona Dea and Æscu lapius. In the Mysteries of Apollo, the pursuit of Latona by the serpent P ython was represented. In the Egyptian Mysteries, the dragon Ty phon pursued Isis. According to Sanchoniathon, TAAUT, the interpreter of Heaven to men, attributed something divine to the nature of the dragon and serpents, in which die Phœnicians and Egyptians followed him. They have more vitality, more spiritual force, than any other creature; of a fier y nature, shown by the rapidity of their motions, without the limbs of other animals. They assume many shapes and atti tudes, and dart with extraordinar y quickness and force. When they have reached old age, they throw off that age and are young again, and increase in size and strength, for a certain period of y ears. The Egyptian Priests fed the sacred serpents in the te mple at Thebes. Taaut himself had in his writings discussed these mysteries in regard to the serpent. Sanchoniathon said in another work, that the serpent was immortal, and re-entered into himself; which, according to some ancient theosophists, particularl y those of India, was an attribut e of the Deity. And he also said that the serpent never died, unless b y a violent death. The Phœnicians called the serpent Agathodemon [the good spirit]; and Kneph was the Serpent- God of the Eg yptians. The Egyptians, Sanchoniathon said, represented the serpent with the head of a hawk, on account of the swift flight of that bird: and the chief Hierophant, the sacred interpreter, gave very mysterious explanations of that symbol; saying that such a serpent was a ver y divine creature, and that, opening his e yes, he lighted with their rays the whole of first- born space: when he closes the m, it is darkness again. In realit y, the hawk-headed serpent, genius of light, or good genius, wa s the symbol of the Sun. In the hierogl yphic characters, a snake was the letter T or DJ . It occurs man y times on the Rosetta stone. The horned serpent was the hierogl yphic for a God. According to Eusebius, the Egyptians represented the world b y a blue circle, sprinkled with flames, within which was extended a serpent with the head of a hawk. Proclus sa ys they represented the four quarters of the world by a cross, and the soul of the world, or Kneph, b y a serpent surrounding it in the form of a circle. We read in Anaxagoras, that Orpheus said, that the water, and the vessel that produced it, were the primitive principles of things, and together gave existence to an ani mated being, which was a serpent, with two heads, one of a lion and the other of a bull, between which was the figure of a God who se name was Hercules or Kronos: that from Hercules came the egg of the world, which produced Heaven and earth, b y dividing itself into two hemispheres: and that the God Phanes, w hich issued from that egg, was in the shape of a serpent.

In a sculpture from Kouyunjik, two serpents attached to poles are near a fire-altar, at which two eunuchs are standing. Upon it is the sacred fire, and a bearded figure leads a wild goat to the sacrifice. The serpent of the Temple of Epidaurus was sacred to Æsculapius , the God of M edicine, and 462 ye ars after the building of the city, was taken to Rome after a pestilence. The Phœnicians represented the God Nomu ( Kneph or Amun-Kneph ) by a serpent. In Egypt, a Sun supported b y two asps wa s the emblem of Horhat the good genius; and the serpent with the winged globe was placed over the doors and window s of the Temples as a tutelary God. Antipater of Sidon calls Amun \"the renowned Serpent,\" and the Cerastes is often found emba lmed in the Thebaid. On ancient Tyrian coins and Indian med als, a serpent was represented, coiled round the trunk of a tree. Python , the Serpent Deity, was estee med oracular; and the tripod at Delphi was a triple- headed serpent of gold. The portals of all the Egyptian Temples are decorated with the hierogra m of the Circle and the Serpent. It is also found upon the Temple of Naki-Rustan in Persia; on the triu mphal arch at Pechin, in China; over the gates of the great Temple of Chaundi Teeva, in Java; upon the walls of Athens; and in the Temple of Minerva at Tegea. The Mexican hierogram was formed by the intersecting of two great Serpents, which described the circle with their bodies, and had each a human head in its mouth. All the Buddhists crosses in Ireland had serpents carved upon them. Wreaths of snakes are on the columns of the ancient Hindu Te mple at Burwah-Sangor. Among the Egyptians, it was a s ymbol of Divine Wisdom, when extended at length; and, with its tail in its mouth, of Eternit y. In the ritual of Zoroaster, the Serpent was a sy mbol of the Universe. In China, the ring between two Serpents was the s ymbol of the world governed by the power and wisdom of the Creator. The Bacchanals carried serpents in their hands or round their heads. The Serpent entwined round an Egg, wa s a symbol common to the Indians, the Egyptians, and the Druids. It referred to the creation of the Universe. A Serpent with an egg in his mouth was a sy mbol of the Universe containing within itself the germ of all things that the Sun develops. The property possessed by the Serpent, of casting its skin, and apparentl y renewing its youth, made it an emb lem of eternit y and immortality. The Syrian women still employ it as a charm against barrenness, as did the devotees of Mithras and Saba- Zeus. The Earth- born civilizers of the early world, Fohi, Cecrops, and Erechtheus, were half- man, half-serpent. The snake was the guardian of the Athenian Acropolis.

In Hebre w writers it is generall y a type of evil; and is particul arly so in the Indian and Per sian Mythologies.

A serpent-ring was a well-known sy mbol of time: and to express dram atically how time preys upon itself, the Egyptian priests fed vipers in a subterranean chamber, as it were in the sun's Winter abode on the fat of bulls, or the year's plenteousness. The dragon of Winter pursues Am mon, the golden ram, to Mount Casius. The Virgin of the zodiac is bitten in the heel by Serpens, who, with Scorpio, rises immediately behind her; and as honey, the emb lem of purity and salvation, was thought to be an antidote to the serpent's bite, so the bees of Aristæus, the emblems of nature's abundance, are destroy ed through the agency of the serpent, and regenerated within the entrails of the Vernal Bull. The Sun-God is finall y victorious. Chrishna crushes the head of the serpent Calyia; Apollo destroys Python, and Hercules that Lernæan monster whose poison festered in the foot of Philoctet es, of Mopsus, of Chiron, or of Sagittarius. The infant Hercules destro ys the pernicious snakes detested of the gods, and ever, like St. George of England and Michael the Archangel, wars against hydras and dragons. The eclipses of the sun and moon were believed by the orientals to be caused by the assaults of a dæmon in dragon- form; and they endeavored to scare away the intruder by shouts and men aces. This was the original Leviathan or Crooked Serpent of old, transfixed in the olden time by the power of Jehovah, and suspended as a glittering trophy in the sky ; yet also the Power of Darkness suppo sed to be ever in pursuit of the Sun and M oon. When it finally overtakes them, it will entwine them in its folds, and prevent their shining. In the last Indian Avatara, as in the Eddas, a serpent vomiting flames is expected to destroy the world, The serpent presides over the close of the y ear, where it guards the approach to the golden fleece of Aries, and the three apples or seasons of the Hesperides; presenting a formidable obstacle to the career of the Sun-God. The Great Destroyer of snakes is occasionall y married to them; Hercules with the northern dragon begets the three ancestors of Scythia; for the Sun seems at one tim e to rise victorious from the contest with darkness, and at another to sink into its embr aces. The northern constella tion Draco, whose Page 357 of 621"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike sinuosities wind like a river through the wintry bear, was made the astronom ical cincture of the Universe, as the serpent encircles the mundane egg in Eg yptian hierogl yphics. The Persian Ahriman was called \"The old serpent, the liar from the beginning, the Prince of Darkness, and the rover up and down.\" The Dragon was a well- known symbol of the waters and of great rivers; and it was natural that by the pastoral Asiatic Tribes, the powerful nations of the alluvial plains in their neighborhood who adored the dragon or Fish, should themse lves be symbolized under the form of dragons; and overco me by the superior might of the Hebrew God, as monstrous Leviathans maimed and destroy ed by him. Ophioneus, in the old Greek Theolog y, warred against Kronos, and wa s overco me and cast into his proper elem ent, the sea. There he is installed as the Sea-God Oannes or Dragon, the Leviathan of the water y half of creation, the dragon who vomi ted a flood of water after the persecuted woman of the Apocal ypse, the monster who threatened to devour Hesione and Andromeda, and who for a time became the grave of Hercules and Jonah; and he corresponds with the obscure name of Rahab , whom Jehovah is said in Job to have transfixed and overco me. In the Spring, the year or Sun-G od appears as Mithras or Europa mounted on the Bull; but in the opposite half of the Zodiac he rides the emb lem of the waters, the winged horse of Nestor or Poseidon: and the Serpent, rising heliaca lly at the Autumnal Equinox, besetting with poisonou s influence the cold constellation Sagittarius, is explained as the reptile in the path who \"bites the horse's heels, so that his rider falls backward.\" The same serpent, the Oannes Aphrenos or M usaros of Sy ncellus, was the Midgard Serpent which Odin sunk beneath the sea, but which grew to such a size as to encircle the whole earth. For these Asiatic symbols of the contest of the Sun-God with the Dragon of darknes s and Winter were imported not onl y into the Zodiac, but into the more homely circle of European legend; and both Thor and Odin fight with dragons, as Apollo did with P ython, the great scaly snake, Achilles with the Scamand er, and Bellerophon with the Chimæra. In the apocry phal book of Esther, dragon s herald \"a day of darkness and obscurity \"; and St. George of England, a problema tic Cappadocian Prince, was originall y only a varying form of Mithras. Jehovah is said to have \"cut Rahab and wounded the dragon.\" The latter is not only the type of earthl y desolation, the dragon of the deep waters, but also the leader of the banded conspirators of the sky, of the rebellious stars, which, according to Enoch, \"ca me not at the right ti me\"; and his tail drew a third part of the Host of Heaven, and cast the m to the earth. Jehovah \"divided the sea by his strength, and broke the heads of the Dragons in the waters.\" And according to the Jewish and Persian belief, the Dragon would, in the latter days, the Winter of time, enjoy a short period of licensed impuni ty, which would be a season of the greatest suffering to the people of the earth; but he would finall y be bound or destroyed in the great battle of Mes siah; or, as it seems intimated by the Rabbinical figure of being eaten by the faithful, be, like Ahriman or Vasouki, ulti mately absorbed b y and united with the Principle of good. Near the image of Rhea, in the Temple of Bel at Babylon, were two large serpents of silver, says Diodorus, each weighing thirt y talents; and in the same temple was an imag e of Juno, holding in her right hand the head of a serpent. The Greeks called Bel Beliar ; and Hesychius interprets that word to me an a dragon or great serpent. We learn from the book Page 358 of 621"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike of Bel and the Dragon, that in Baby lon was kept a great, live serpent, which the people worshipped. The Assyrians, the Emperors of Constantinople, the Parthians, Scythians, Saxons, Chinese, and Danes all bore the serpent as a standard, and among the spoils taken by Aurelian from Zenobia were such standards, Persici Dracones . The Persians represented Ormuzd and Ahriman by two serpents, contending for the mundane egg. Mithras is represented with a lion's head and human body, encircled by a serpent. In the Sadder is this precept: \"When you kill serpents, y ou will repeat the Zend-Avesta, and thence you will obtain great merit; for it is the same as if you had killed so many devils.\" Serpents encircling rings and globes, and issuing from globes, are com mon in the Persian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian monum ents. Vishnu is represented reposing on a coiled serpent, whose folds form a canopy over him. Mahadeva is represented with a snake around his neck, one around his hair, and arm lets of serpents on both arms. Bhairava sits on the coils of a serpent, whose head rises above his own. Parvati has snakes about her neck and waist. Vishnu is the Preserving Spirit, Mahadeva is Siva, the Evil Principle, Bhairava is his son , and Parvati his consort. The King of Evil Demons was called in Hind ū Mythology, Naga , the King of Serpents, in which nam e we trace the Hebrew Nachash , serpent. In Cashmer e were seven hundred places where carved im ages of serpents were worshipped; and in Thibet the great Chinese Dragon ornam ented the Temples of the Grand Lama. In China, the dragon wa s the stamp and symbol of royalty, sculptured in all the Temples, blazoned on the furniture of the houses, and interwoven with the vestm ents of the chief nobility. The Emperor bears it as his armoria l device; it is engraved on his sceptre and diadem, and on all the vases of the imperial palace. The Chinese believe that there is a dragon of extraordinar y strength and sovereign power, in Heaven, in the air, on the waters, and on the mount ains. The God Fohi is said to have had the form of a man, terminating in the tail of a snake, a combina tion to be more fully explained to you in a subsequent Degree. The dragon and serpent are the 5th and 6th signs of the Chinese Zodiac; and the Hindus and Chinese believe that, at every eclipse, the sun or moon is seized by a huge serpent or dragon, the serpent Asootee of the Hindus, which enfolds the globe and the constellation Draco; to which also refers \"the War in Heaven, when Michael and his Angels fought against the dragon.\" Sanchoniathon says that Taaut was the author of the worship of serpents among the Phœnicians. He \"consecrated,\" he says, \"the species of dragon s and serpents; and the Phœnicians and Egy ptians followed him in this superstition.\" He was \"the first who made an image of Cœlus\"; that is; who represented the Heavenl y Hosts of Stars b y visible symbols; and wa s probabl y the same as the Egyptian Thoth. On the Tyrian coins of the age of Alexander, serpents are represented in man y positions and attitud es, coiled around trees, erect in front of altars, and crushed b y the Syrian Hercules. The seventh letter of the Eg yptian alphabet, called Zeuta or Life , was sacred to Thoth, and was expressed by a serpent standing on his tail; and that Deity, the God of healing, like Page 359 of 621"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Æsculapius, to whom the serpent was consecrated, leans on a knotted stick around which coils a snake. The Isiac tablet, describing the Mysteries of Isis, is charged with serpents in every part, as her emblems. The Asp was speciall y dedicated to her, and is seen on the heads of her statues, on the bonnets of her priests, and on the tiaras of the Kings of Egypt. Serapis was somet imes represented with a human head and serpentine tail: and in one engraving two minor Gods are represented with him, one by a serpent with a bull's head, and the other by a serpent with the radiated head of a lion. On an ancient sacrificial vessel found in Denmark, having several compar tments, a serpent is represented attacking a kneeling boy, pursuing hi m, retreating before hi m, appealed to beseechingl y by him, and conversing with hi m. We are at once rem inded of the Sun at the new year represented by a child sitting on a lotus, and of the relations of the Sun of Spring with the Autumna l Serpent, pursued by and pursuing him, and in conjunction with him. Other figures on this vessel belong to the Zodiac. The base of the tripod of the Pythian Priestess was a triple- headed serpent of bras s, whose body, folded in circles growing wider and wider toward the ground, formed a conical column, while the three heads, disposed triangular ly, upheld the tripod of gold. A simil ar column was placed on a pillar in the Hippodrome at Constantinople, by the founder of that city; one of the heads of which is said to have been broken off by Mahomet the Second, b y a blow with his iron ma ce. The British God Hu wa s called \"The Dragon – Ruler of the World,\" and his car was drawn by serpents. His min isters were st yled adder s . A Druid in a poem of Taliessin says, \"I am a Druid, I am an Architec t , I am a Prophet, I a m a Serpent (Gnadi).\" The Car of the Goddess Ceridwen also was drawn by serpents. In the elegy of Uther Pendragon, this passage occurs in a description of the religious rites of the Druids: \"While the Sanctuary is earnestl y invoking The Gliding King , before whom the Fair One retreats, upon the evil that covers the huge stones; whilst the Dragon moves round over the places which contain vessels of drink-offering, whilst the drink-offering is in the Golden Horns ;\" in which we readil y discover the mystic and obscure allusion to the Autumna l Serpent pursuing the Sun along the circle of the Zodiac, to the celesti al cup or crater, and the Golden horns of Virgil's mi lk-white Bull; and, a line or two further on, we find the Priest imploring the victorious Beli , the Sun-God of the Bab ylonians. With the serpent, in the Ancient Monuments, is very often found associated the Cross. The Serpent upon a Cros s was an Eg yptian Standard. It occurs repeatedl y upon the Grand Stair- case of the Te mple of Osiris at Philæ; and on the pyramid of Ghizeh are represented two kneeling figures erecting a Cross, on the top of which is a serpent erect. The Crux Ansata was a Cros s with a coiled Serpent above it; and it is perhaps the most common of all emblems on the Egyptian Monuments, carried in the hand of almost every figure of a Deit y or a Priest. It was, as we learn b y the monuments, the form of the iron tether-pins, used for making fast to the ground the cords by which y oung animals were confined: and as u sed by shepherds, beca me a symbol of Royalty to the Shepherd Kings. A Cross like a Teutonic or Maltese one, formed by four curved lines within a circle, is also common on the Monuments, and represented the Tropics and the Colures.

It was originall y a simpl e Cross, symbolizing the equator and equinocti al Colure, and the four elem ents proceeding from a common centre. This Cross, surmounted by a circle, and that by a crescent, became an emb lem of the Supreme Deity – or of the active power of generation and the passive power of production conjoined, – and was appropriated to Thoth or Mercury . It then assumed an improv ed form, the arms of the Cross being changed into wings, and the circle and crescent being formed by two snakes, s pringing from the wand, forming a circle by crossing each other, and their heads making the horns of the crescent; in which form it is seen in the hands of Anubis. The triple Tau, in the centre of a circle and a triangle, typifies the Sacred Name ; and represents the Sacred Triad, the Creating, Preserving, and Destroy ing Powers; as well as the three great lights of Masonry . If to the Masonic point within a Circle, and the two parallel lines, we add the single Tau Cross, we have the Ancient Egyptian Triple Tau. A column in the form of a cross, with a circle over it, was used b y the Egyptians to measure the increase of the inundations of the Nile. The Tau and Triple Tau are found in many Ancient Alphabets. With the Tau or the Triple Tau may be connected, within two circles, the double cube, or perfection ; or the perfect ashlar. The Crux Ansata is found on the sculptures of Khorsabad; on the ivories from Nimroud, of the same age, carried by an Assyrian Monarch; and on cylinders of the later Assyrian period. As the single Tau represents the one God, so, no doubt, the Triple Tau, the origin of which cannot be traced, was mean t to represent the Trinity of his attribut es, the three Masonic pillars, WISDO M, STRENGTH, and HAR MONY. The Prophet Ezekiel, in the 4th verse of the 9th chapter, says: \"And the Lord said unto hi m, 'Go through the m idst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and mark the letter TAU upon the foreheads of those that sigh and mourn for all the abomina tions that be done in the midst thereof.\" So the Latin Vulgate, and the probably most ancient copies of the Septuagint translate the passage. This Tau was in the form of the cross of this Degree, and it was the emb lem of life and salvation . The Samar itan Tau and the Ethiopic Tavvi are the evident prototype of the Greek τ; and we learn from Tertulli an, Origen, and St. Jerome, that the Hebrew Tau was ancient ly written in the form of a Cross. In ancient times the mark Tau was set on those who had been acquitt ed by their judges, as a symbol of innocence. The military commanders placed it on soldiers who escaped unhurt from the field of battle, as a sign of their safety under the Divine Protection. It was a sacred symbol among the Druids. Divesting a tree of part of its branches, the y left it in the shape of a Tau Cross, preserved it carefull y, and consecrated it with solemn ceremonies. On the tree they cut deeply the word THA U, by which they meant God. On the right arm of the Cross, they inscribed the word HE SULS, on the left BELEN or Page 361 of 621"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike BELENUS, and on the midd le of the trunk THARA MIS. This represented the sacred Triad . It is certain that the Indians, Egy ptians, and Arabians paid veneration to the sign of the Cross, thousands of ye ars before the coming of Christ. Ever ywhere it was a sacred symbol. The Hindus and the Celtic Druids built many of their Temples in the form of a Cross, as the ruins still remaining clearly show, and particul arly the ancient Druidical Temple at Classerniss in the Island of Lewis in Scotland. The Circle is of 12 Stones. O n each of the sides, east, west, and south, are three. In the centre was the image of the Deity; and on the north an avenue of twice nineteen stones, and one at the entrance. The Supernal Pagoda at Benares is in the form of a Cross; and the Druidical subterranean grotto at New G range in Ireland. The Statue of Osiris at Rome had the same emblem. Isis and Ceres also bore it; and the caverns of initiation were constructed in that shape with a p yramid over the Sacellum . Crosses w ere cut in the stones of the Temple of Serapis in Alexandria; and many Tau Crosses are to be seen in the sculptures of Alabastion and Esné, in Egypt. On coins, the symbol of the Eg yptian God Kneph was a Cros s within a Circle. The Crux An sata was the particular emblem of Osiris, and his sceptre ended with that figure. It was also the emblem of Hermes, and was considered a Sublim e Hierogl yphic, possessing mysterious powers and virtues, as a wonder-working amulet. The Sacred Tau occurs in the hands of the mummy-shaped figures between the forelegs of the row of S phynxes, in the great avenue leading from Luxor to Karnac. B y the Tau Cross the Cabalists expressed the number 10, a perfect number, denoting Heaven, and the Pythagorean Tetract ys, or incomm unicable name of God. The Taft Cross is also found on the stones in front of the door of the Temple of Amunoth III, at Thebes, who reigned about the time when the Israelites took pos session of Canaan: and the Egyptian Priests carried it in all the sacred processions. Tertullian, who had been initiated, informs us that the Tau was inscribed on the forehead of every person w ho had been adm itted into the Mysteries of Mithras. As the simpl e Tau represented Life, so, when the Circle, symbol of Eternit y, was added, it represented Eternal Life. At the Initiation of a King, the Tau, as the emblem of life and ke y of the M ysteries, was impressed upon his lips. In the Indian M ysteries, the Tau Cross, under the name of Tiluk , was marked upon the body of the candidate, as a sign that he was set apart for the Sacred Mysteries. On the upright tablet of the King, discovered at Nimroud, are the names of thirteen Great Gods (among which are YAV and BEL); and the left-hand character of every one is a cros s composed of two cuneiform characters.

Upon the facade of a temp le at Kalabche in Nubia are three regal figures, each holding a Crux Ansata. Like the Subterranean Mithriatic Temple at New Grange in Scotland, the Pagodas of Benares and Mathura were in the form of a Cros s. Magnificent Buddhist Crosse s were erected, and are still standing, at Clonmacno ise, Finglas, and Kilcullen in Ireland. Wherever the monum ents of Buddhism are found, in India, Ceylon, or Ireland, we find the Cross: for Buddha or Boudh was represented to have been crucified. All the planets known to the Ancients were distinguished by the Mystic Cross, in conjunction with the solar or lunar symbols; Saturn b y a cross over a crescent, Jupiter by a cross under a crescent, Mars by a cross resting obliquel y on a circle, Venus by a cross under a circle, and Mercur y by a cross surmount ed by a circle and that by a crescent. The Solstices, Cancer and Capricorn, the two Gates of Heaven, are the two pillars of Hercules, beyond which he, the Sun, never journey ed: and they still appear in our Lodges, as the two great columns, Jachin and Boaz, and also as the two paralle l lines that bound the circle, with a point in the centre, emblem of the Sun, between the two tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The Blazing Star in our Lodges, we have alread y said, represents Sirius, Anubis, or Mercur y, Guardian and Guide of Souls. Our Ancient English brethren also considered it an emblem of the Sun. In the old Lectures they said: \"The Blazing Star or Glor y in the centre refers us to that Grand Lum inary the Sun, which enlightens the Earth, and by its genial influence dispenses bles sings to mankind.\" It is also said in those lectures to be an embl em of Prudence. The word Prudentia means, in its original and fullest signification, Foresight : and accordingl y the Blazing Star has been regarded as an emb lem of Omniscienc e, or the All-Seeing E ye, which to the Ancients was the Sun. Even the Dagger of the Elu of Nine is that used in the Mysteries of Mithras; which, with its blade black and hilt white, was an emblem of the two principles of Light and Darkness. Isis, the same as Ceres, was, as we learn from Eratosthenes, the Constellat ion Virgo, represented by a woman holding an ear of wheat. The different emblems which accomp any her in the description given b y Apuleius, a serpent on either side, a golden vase, with a serpent twined round the handle, and the animals that marched in procession, the bear, the ape, and Pegasus, represented the Constellat ions that, rising with the. Virgin, when on the day of the Vernal Equinox she stood in the Oriental gate of Heaven, brilliant with the rays of the full moon, seemed to march in her train. The cup, consecrated in the Mysteries both of Isis and Eleusis, was the Constellat ion Crater or the Cup. The sacred vessel of the Isiac ceremony finds its counterpart in the Heavens. The Olympic robe presented to the Initiate, a magnif icent mantle, covered with figures of serpents and animals, and under which were twelve other sacred robes, w herewith he was clothed in the sanctuar y, alluded to the starr y Heaven and the twelve signs: while the seven Page 363 of 621"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike preparator y immersions in the sea alluded to the seven spheres, through which the soul plunged, to arrive here below and take up its abode in a bod y. The Celestial Virgin, during the last three centuries that preceded the Christian era, occupied the horoscope or Oriental point, and that gate of Heaven through which the Sun and Moon ascended above the horizon at the two equinoxes. Again it occupied it at midnight, at the Winter Solstice, the precise moment when the year commenced. Thus it was essentially connected with the march of times and seasons, of the Sun, the Moon, and day and night, at the principal epochs of the year. At the equinoxes were celebrated the greater and lesser My steries of Ceres. When souls descended past the Balance, at the moment when the Sun occupied that point, the Virgin rose before him; she stood at the gates of day and opened them to him. Her brilliant Star, Spica Virginis, and Arcturus, in Boötes, northwe st of it, heralded his coming. When he had returned to the Vernal Equinox, at the mo ment when souls were generated, again it was the Celestia l Virgin that led the march of the signs of night; and in her stars cam e the beautiful full moon of that month. Night and day were in succession introduced by her, when the y began to di minish in length; and souls, before arriving at the gates of Hell, were also led by her. In going through these signs, they passed the Styx in the 8th Degree of Libra. She was the famous Sibyl who initia ted Eneas, and opened to him the wa y to the infernal regions. This peculiar situation of the Constellation Virgo, has caused it to enter into all the sacred fables in regard to nature, under different names and the most varied forms. It often takes the name of Isis or the Moon, w hich, when at its full at the Vernal Equinox, was in union with it or beneath its feet. Mercury (or Anubis) having his domic ile and exaltat ion in the sign Virgo, was, in all the sacred fables and Sanctuaries, the inseparable compan ion of Isis, without whose counsels she did nothing. This relation between the emblems and mysterious recitals of the initi ations, and the Heavenl y bodies and order of the world, was still more clear in the Mysteries of Mithras, adored as the Sun in Asia Minor, Cappadocia, Armenia, and Persia, and whose My steries went to Rome in the time of Sylla. This is ampl y proved by the descriptions we have of the Mithriac cave, in which were figured the two move ments of the Heavens, that of the fixed Stars and that of the Planets, the Constellat ions, the eight mystic gates of the spheres, and the symbols of the ele ments. So on a celebrated monum ent of that religion, found at Rome, were figured, the Serpent or H ydra under Leo, as in the Heavens, the Celestia l Dog, the Bull, the Scorpion, the Seven Planets, represented by seven altars, the Sun, M oon, and emblems relating to Light, to Darkne ss, and to their succession during the year, where each in turn triumphs for six months. The Mysteries of Atys were celebrated when the Sun entered Aries; and among the emblems was a ram at the foot of a tree which was being cut down. Thus, if not the whole truth, it is yet a large part of it, that the Heathen Pantheon, in its infinite diversit y of names and personificat ions, was but a mul titudinous, though in its origin unconscious allegor y, of which physical phenom ena, and principall y the Heavenl y Bodies, were the fundam ental types. The glorious im ages of Divinit y which formed Jehovah's H ost, were the Divine Dynasty or real theocrac y which governed the earl y world; and the m en of the golden age, whose looks held commerce with the skies, and who Page 364 of 621"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike watched the radiant rulers bringing Winter and Summ er to mort als, might be said with poetic truth to live in immediate communication with Heaven, and, like the Hebrew Patriarchs, to see God face to face. Then the Gods introduced their own worship among mankind: then Oannes, Oe or Aquarius ro se from the Red Sea to i mpart science to the Babylonians; then the bright Bull legislated for India and Crete; and the Lights of Heaven, personified as Liber and Ceres, hung the Bœotian hills with vine-yards, and gave the golden sheaf to Eleusis. The children of men were, in a sense, allied or marr ied, to those sons of G od who sang the jubilee of creation; and the encircling vault with its countless Stars, which to the excited imagination of the solitary Chaldæan wanderer appeared as animated intellig ences, might naturall y be compar ed to a gigantic ladder, on which, in their rising and setting, the Angel luminar ies appeared to be ascending and descending between earth and Heaven. The original revelation died out of men's memories; they worshipped the Creature instead of the Creator; and holding all earthly things as connected by eternal links of harmon y and sympathy with the heavenl y bodies, the y united in one view astronom y, astrology , and religion. Long wandering thus in error, the y at length ceased to look upon the Stars and .external nature as Gods; and by directing their attention to the microcosm or narrower world of self, they again became acquainted with the True Ruler and Guide of the Universe, and used the old fables and superstitions as symbols and allegori es, by which to conve y and under which to hide the great truths which had faded out of most men's remembrance. In the Hebrew w ritings, the term \"Heavenl y Hosts\" includes not only the counsellors and emissaries of Jehovah, but also the celesti al luminaries; and the stars, imag ined in the East to be anim ated intelligen ces, presiding over human weal and woe, are identified with the more distinctl y impersonated messengers or angels, who execute the Divine decrees, and whose predomin ance in Heaven is in mysterious correspondence and relation with the powers and domin ions of the earth. In Job, the Morning Stars and the Sons of G od are identified; they join in the same chorus of praise to the Alm ighty; they are both susceptible of joy; they walk in brightness, and are liable to impuri ty and imperfec tion in the sight of God. The Elohim originall y included not only foreign superstitious forms, but also all that host of Heaven which was revealed in poetr y to the shepherds of the desert, now as an encampment of warriors, now as careering in chariots of fire, and now as winged messengers, ascending and descending the vault of Heaven, to com municate the will of God to mank ind. \"The Eternal,\" says the Bereshith Rabba to Genesis, \"called forth Abraham and his posterit y out of the domin ion of the stars; by nature, the Israelite was a servant to the stars, and born under their influence, as are the heathen; but by virtue of the law given on Mount Sinai, he beca me liberated from this degrading servitude.\" The Arabs had a simi lar legend. The Prophet Amos explicit ly asserts that the Israelites, in the desert, worshipped, not Jehovah, but Moloch, or a Star- God, equivalen t to Saturn. The Gods El or Jehovah were not merely planetar y or solar. Their symbolism, like that of every other Deity, was coextensive with nature, and with the mind of man. Yet the astrological character is assigned even to Jehovah. He is described as seated on the pinnacle of the Universe, leading forth the Hosts of Heaven, and telling them unerringl y by name and number. His stars are His sons and His ey es, which run through the whole world, keeping watch over men's deeds. The stars and planets were properl y the angels. In Pharisaic tradition, as in the Page 365 of 621"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike phraseolog y of the New Testam ent, the Heavenl y Host appears as an Angelic Army, divided into regiments and brigades, under the command of imag inary chiefs, such as Massaloth, Legion, Kartor Gistra, etc., – each Gistra being captain of 365,000 m yriads of stars. The Seven Spirits which stand before the throne, spoken of by several Jewish writers, and generall y presumed to have been immediately derived from the Persian Amshaspands, were ulti mately the seven planetar y intelligences, the original model of the seven-branched golden candlestick exhibited to Moses on G od's mountain. The stars were i magined to have fought in their courses against Sisera. The heavens were spoken of as holding a predom inance over earth, as governing it by signs and ordinances, and as containing the elements of that astrological wisdom, more especiall y cultivated by the Bab ylonians and Egyptians. Each nation was supposed b y the Hebrew s to have its own guardian angel, and its own provincial star. One of the chiefs of the Celestial Powers, at first Jehovah Himself in the character of the Sun, standing in the height of Heaven, overlooking and governing all things, afterward one of the angels or subordinate planetar y genii of Baby lonian or Persian mythology, was the patron and protector of their own nation, \"the Prince that standeth for the children of thy people.\" The discords of earth were accomp anied by a warfare in the sky; and no people underwent the visitat ion of the Almight y, without a corresponding chastise ment being inflicted on its tutelary angel. The fallen Angels were also fallen Stars; and the first allusion to a feud among the spiritual powers in earl y Hebrew My thology, where Rahab and his confederates are defeated, like the Titans in a battle against the Gods, seems to identif y the rebellious Spirits as part of the visible Heavens, where the \"high ones on high\" are punished or chained, as a signal proof of God' s power and ju stice. God, it is said – \"Stirs the sea with His migh t by His understanding He smote Rahab – His breath clears the face of Heaven – His hand pierced the crooked Serpent... God withdraws not His anger; beneath Him bow the confederates of Rahab.\" Rahab always means a sea-monster: probably some such legendar y monstrous dragon, as in almost all mythologies is the adversar y of Heaven and demon of eclipse, in whose bell y, significant ly called the bell y of Hell, Hercules, like Jonah, pas sed three days, ultimately escaping with the loss of his hair or ra ys. Chesil, the rebellious giant Orion, represented in Job as riveted to the sky, was compared to Ninus or Nimrod, the mythical founder of Nineveh (City of Fish) the mighty hunter, who slew lions and panthers before the Lord. Rahab's confederates are probably the \"High ones on High,\" the Chesili m or constellations in Isaiah, the Heavenly Host or Heavenl y Powers, among whose number were found foll y and disobedience. \"I beheld,\" says Pseudo-Enoch, \"seven stars like great blazing mounta ins, and like Spirits, entreating me. And the angel said, This place, until the consumm ation of Heaven and Earth, will be the prison of the Stars and of the Ho st of Heaven. These are the Stars w hich overstepped God's command before their time arrived; and came not at their proper season; therefore was he offended with them, and bound the m, until the time of the consummation of their crimes in the secret year.\" And again: \"These Seven Stars are those which have Page 366 of 621"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike transgressed the commandment of the Most High God, and which are here bound until the number of the da ys of their crimes be comp leted.\" The Jewish and early Christian writers looked on the worship of the sun and the elements with compara tive indulgence. Justin Martyr and Clemens of Alexandria admit that God had appointed the stars as legiti mate objects of heathen worship, in order to preserve throughout the world some tolerable notions of natural religion. It seemed a middle point between Heathenism and Christianit y; and to it certain emblems and ordinances of that faith seemed to relate. The advent of Christ was announced by a Star from the East; and His nativit y was celebrat ed on the shortest day of the Julian Calendar, the day when, in the physical commemorations of Persia and Egypt, Mithras or Osiris was newly found. It was then that the accla mations of the Host of Heaven, the unfailing attendants of the Sun, surrounded, as at the spring-dawn of creation, the cradle of His birth- place, and that, in the words of Ignatius, \"a star, with light inexpressible, shone forth in the Heavens, to destroy the power of magic and the bonds of wickedness; for God Himself had appeared, in the form of man, for the renewal of eternal life.\" But however infinite the variety of objects which helped to develop the notion of Deit y, and eventuall y assumed its place, substituting the worship of the creature for that of the creator; of parts of the body, for that of the soul, of the Universe, still the notion itself was essentiall y one of unit y. The idea of one God, of a creative, productive, governing unity, resided in the earliest exertion of thought: and this monothe ism of the primitive ages, makes every succeeding epoch, unless it be the present, appear onl y as a stage in the progress of degenerac y and aberration. Everywhere in the old faiths we find the idea of a supreme or presiding Deit y. Amun or Osiris presides among the many gods of Egypt; Pan, with the music of his pipe, directs the chorus of the constella tions, as Zeus leads the solemn procession of the celestial troops in the astronomical theolog y of the Pythagoreans. \"Amidst an infinite diversit y of opinions on all other sub jects,\" says Maximus Tyrius, \"the whole world is unanimous in the belief of one onl y almighty King and Father of all.\" There is alwa ys a Sovereign Power, a Zeus or Deus, Mahadeva or Adideva, to whom belongs the ma intenan ce of the order of the Universe. Among the thousand god s of India, the doctrine of Divine Unity is never lost sight of; and the ethereal Jove, wor shipped by the Persian in an age long before Xenophanes or Anaxagoras, appears as supremel y comprehensive and independent of planetar y or elem ental subdivisions, as the \"Vast One\" or \"Great Soul\" of the Vedas. But the simpl icity of belief of the patriarchs did not exclude the emp loyment of symbolical representations. 'Fl mind never rests satisfied with a mere feeling. That feeling ever strives to assume precision and durabilit y as an idea, b y some outward delineation of its thought. Even the ideas that are above and be yond the senses, as all ideas of God are, require the aid of the senses for their expression and communication. Hence come the representative forms and symbols which constitute the external investiture of every religion; attempts to express a religious sentiment that is essentially one , and that vainly struggles for adequate external utterance, striving to tell to one man, to paint to him, an idea existing in the mind of another, and essentiall y incapable of utteranc e or description, in a language all the words of which have a sensuous meaning. Thus, the idea being perhaps the same in all, its Page 367 of 621"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike expressions and utteranc es are infinite ly various, and branch into an infinite diversit y of creeds and sects. All religious expression is symbolism; since we can describe onl y what we see; and the true objects of religion are unseen. The earliest instruments of education were symbols; and they and all other religious forms differed and still differ according to external circumstances and im agery, and according to differences of knowledge and mental cultivation. To present a visible s ymbol to the eye of another is not to inform him of the meaning which that symbol has to you . Hence the philosopher soon super-added to these symbols, explanat ions addressed to the ear, susceptible of more precision, but less effective, obvious, and impr essive than the painted or sculptured forms which he despised. Out of these explanations grew b y degrees a variet y of narratives, whose true object and meaning were graduall y forgotten. And when these were abandoned, and philosophy resorted to definitions and formulas, its language was but a more refined symbolism, grappling with and attem pting to picture ideas impossible to be expressed. For the most abstract expression for Deity which language can supply , is but a sign or symbol for an object unknown, and no more truthful and adequate than the terms Osiris and Vishnu, except as being less sen suous and explici t. To say that He is a Spirit , is but to sa y that He is not matter. What spirit is, we can only define as the Ancients did, by resorting, as if in despair, to some sublimized species of ma tter, as Light, Fire, or Ether. No symbol of Deit y can be appropriate or durable except in a relative or mora l sense. We cannot exalt words that have onl y a sensuous mean ing, above sense. To call Him a Power or a Force , or an Intelligenc e , is mer ely to deceive ourselves into the belief that we use words that have a me aning to us, when the y have none, or at least no more than the ancient visible symbols had. To call Him Sovereign , Father , Grand Architect of the Universe , Extension , Time , Beginning , Middle , and End , whose face is turned on all sides , the Source of life and death , is but to present other men with sy mbols by which we vainl y endeavor to communicate to them 'the same vague ideas which men in all ages have impo tently struggled to express. And it ma y be doubted whether we have succeeded either in communicating, or in forming in our own minds, any more distinct and definite and true and adequate idea of the Deit y, with all our me taphysical conceits and logical subtleties, than the rude ancients did, who endeavored to symbolize and so to express His attributes, by the Fire, the Light, the Sun and Stars, the Lotus and the Scarabæus; all of them types of what, except by types, more or less sufficient, could not be expressed at all. The primitive man recognized the Divine Presence under a variet y of appearances, without losing his faith in this unit y and Supremac y. The invisible God, manifested and on one of His man y sides visible, did not cease to be God to him. He recognized Him in the evening breeze of Eden, in the whirlwind of Sinai, in the Stone of Beth- El: and identified Him with the fire or thunder or the immovable rock adored in Ancient Arabia. To him the image of the Deity was reflected in all that was pre-eminen t in excellence. He saw Jehovah, like Osiris and Bel, in the Sun as well as in the Stars, w hich were His children, His eyes, \"which run through the whole world, and watch over the Sacred Soil of Palestine, from the year's commencement to its close.\" He was the sacred fire of Mount Sinai, of the burning bush, of the Persians, those Puritans of Paganism.

Hebrew Theis m itself became involved in symbolism and image- worship, to which all religions ever tend. We have alread y seen what was the symbolism of the Tabernacl e, the Temple, and the Ark. The Hebrew establishm ent tolerated not only the use of emb lematic vessels, vestmen ts, and cherubs, of Sacred Pillars and Seraphim, but symbolical representations of Jehovah Himself, not even confined to poetical or illustrative language. \"Among the Adityas,\" says Chrishna, in the Bagvat Ghita, \"I am Vishnu, the radiant Sun among the Stars; among the waters, I am ocean; among the mounta ins, the Him alaya; and among the moun tain-tops, Meru.\" The Psalms and Isaiah are full of simi lar attempts to convey to the mind ideas of God, by ascribing to Him sensual proportions. He rides on the clouds, and sits on the wings of the wind. Heaven is His pavilion, and out of His mouth issue lightnings. Men cannot worship a mere abstraction. They require some outward form in which to clothe their conceptions, and invest their sympathies. If they do not shape and carve or paint visible images, they have invisible ones, perhaps quite as inadequate and unfaithful, within their own minds. The incongruous and monstrous in the Oriental images came from the desire to embod y the Infinite, and to convey by multi-plied, because individual ly inadequate symbols, a notion of the Divine Attributes to the understanding. Perhaps we s hould find that we mentally do the same thing, and make within ourselves images quite as incongruous, if judged of by our own limi ted conceptions, if we were to undertake to analyze and gain a clear idea of the mass of infinite attribut es which we assign to the Deity; and even of His infinite Justice and infinite Mercy and Love. We may well say, in the language of Maximus Tyrius: \"If, in the desire to obtain some faint conception of the Universal Father, the Nameless Lawgiver, men had recourse to words or names, to silver or gold, to animals or plants, to mounta in-tops or flowing rivers, every one inscribing the most valued and most beautiful things with the name of Deity , and with the fondness of a lover clinging with rapture to each trivial reminisc ence of the Beloved, why should we seek to reduce this universal practice of symbolism, necessar y, indeed, since the mind often needs the excite ment of the im agination to rouse it into activity, to one monotonous standard of formal propriet y? Only let the image duly perform its task, and bring the divine idea with vividness and truth before the men tal eye; if this be effected, whether by the art of Phidias, the poetr y of Homer, the Egyptian Hierogly ph, or the Persian ele ment, we need not cavil at external differences, or lamen t the seeming fertility of unfam iliar creeds, so long as the great essential is attained , THAT MEN ARE MADE TO REMEMBER, TO U NDERSTAN D, AND TO LOVE.\" Certainl y, when men regarded Light and Fire as something spiritual, and above all the corruptions and exemp t from all the deca y of matter; when they looked upon the Sun and Stars and Planets as composed of this finer ele ment, and as the mselves great and mysterious Intelligenc es, infinitel y superior to man, living Existences, gifted with migh ty powers and wielding vast influences, those elements and bodies convey ed to them, when used as s ymbols of Deit y, a far more adequate idea than they can now do to us, or than we Page 369 of 621"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike can comprehend, now that Fire and Light are familiar to us as air and water, and the Heavenl y Luminaries are lifeless worlds like our own. Perhaps the y gave the m ideas as adequate as we obtain from the mer e words by which we endeavor to symbolize and shadow forth the ineffable mysteries and infinite attributes of God. There are, it is true, dangers inseparable from symbolism, which countervail its advantages, and afford an impressive lesson in regard to the similar risks attendan t on the use of language. The imagination, invited to assist the reason, usurps its place, or leaves its ally helplessl y entangled in its web. Names which stand for things are confounded with them; the means are mist aken for the end: the instrumen t of interpret ation for the object; and thus sy mbols come to usurp an independent character as truths and persons. Though perhaps a necessary path, they were a dangerous one b y which to approach the Deity; in which \"many,\" says Plutarch, \"mistaking the sign for the thing signified, fell into a ridiculous superstition; while others, in avoiding one extrem e, plunged into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impiety.\" All great Refor mers have warred against this evil, deeply feeling the intell ectual mischief arising out of a degraded idea of the Supreme Being: and have claimed for their own God an existence or personalit y distinct from the objects of ancient superstition; disowning in His name the symbols and images that had profaned His Temp le. But they have not seen that the utmost which can be effected by human effort, is to substitute impressions relatively correct, for others whose falsehood has been detected, and to re- place a gross symbolism by a purer one. Every man, without being aware of it, worships a conception of his own mind; for all symbolism, as well as all language, shares the subjective character of the ideas it represents. The epithets we appl y to God only recall either visible or intellectual symbols to the eye or mind. The modes or forms of man ifestation of the reverentia l feeling that constitutes the religious sentim ent, are incomp lete and progressive; each term and symbol predicates a partial truth, rem aining always amenable to improvement or modif ication, and, in its turn, to be superseded b y others mor e accurate and comprehensive. Idolatry consists in confounding the symbol with the thing signified, the substitution of a material for a mental object of worship, after a higher spiritualism has becom e possible; an ill-judged preference of the inferior to the superior symbol, an inadequat e and sensual conception of the Deit y: and ever y religion and ever y conception of God is idolatrous, in so far as it is imperfe ct, and as it substitutes a feeble and temporar y idea in the shrine of that Undiscoverable Being who can be known only in part, and who can therefore be honored, even b y the most enlightened among His wor shippers, only in proportion to their limited powers of understanding and imag ining to themselv es His perfections. Like the belief in a Deity, the belief in the soul's im mortality is rather a natural feeling, an adjunct of self- consciousnes s, than a dogma belonging to any particul ar age or country . It gives eternity to man's nature, and reconciles its seeming anomal ies and contradic tions; it makes him strong in weakness and perfectible in imperfection; and it alone gives an adequate object for his hopes and energies, and value and dignit y to his pursuits. It is concurrent with the belief in an infinite, eternal Spirit, since it is chiefl y through Page 370 of 621"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike consciousness of the dignity of the mind within us, that we learn to appreciat e its evidences in the Universe. To fortify, and as far as possible to impart this hope, was the great aim of ancient wisdom, whether expressed in forms of poetr y or philosophy ; as it was of the M ysteries, and as it is of Masonry . Life rising out of death was the great mystery, which s ymbolism delighted to represent under a thousand ingenious forms. Nature was ransacked for attestat ions to the grand truth which seems to transcend all other gifts of imagin ation, or rather to be their essence and consumm ation. Such evidences were easily discovered. They were found in the olive and the lotus, in the evergreen myrtle of the Mystæ and of the grave of Polydorus, in the deadl y but self- renewing serpent, the wonderful mo th emerging from the coffin of the worm, the pheno mena of germina tion, the settings and risings of the sun and stars, the darkening and growth of the moon, and in sleep, \"the minor mystery of death.\" The stories of the birth of Apollo from Latona, and of dead heroes, like Glaucus, resuscitated in caves, were allegories of the natural alternations of life and death in nature, changes that are but expedients to preserve her virginit y and purit y inviolable in the general sum of her operations, whose aggregate presents only a majestic calm, rebuking alike man's presumpt ion and his despair. The typical death of the Nature- God, O siris, At ys, Adonis, Hiram, was a profound but consolator y mystery: the heating charms of Orpheus were connected with his destruction; and his bones, those valued pledges of fertili ty and victory, were, b y a beautiful contrivance, often buried within the sacred precincts of his immortal equivalent. In their doctrines as to the immortality of the soul, the Greek Philosophers merel y stated with more precision ideas long before extant independentl y among themse lves, in the form of symbolical suggestion. Egypt and Ethiopia in these ma tters learned from India, where, as everywhere else, the origin of the doctrine was as remot e and untraceabl e as the origin of man himself. Its natural expression is found in the language of Chrishna, in the Bagvat Ghita: \"I myself never was non-existent, nor thou, nor these princes of the Earth; nor shall we ever hereafter cease to be... The soul is not a thing of which a man may say, it hath been, or is about to be, or is to be hereafter; for it is a thing without birth; it is pre-existent, changeless, eternal, and is not to be destroyed with this mortal frame.\" According to the dogma of antiquit y, the thronging forms of life are a series of purify ing migrations, through which the divine principle re-ascends to the unit y of its source. Inebriated in the bowl of Dionu sos, and dazzled in the m irror of existence, the souls, those fragments or sparks of the Universal Intelligenc e, forgot their native dignity, and pas sed into the terrestrial frames they coveted. The most usual type of the spirit's descent was suggested b y the sinking of the Sun and Stars from the upper to the lower hem isphere. When it arrived within the portals of the proper empir e of Dionuso s, the God of this World, the scene of delusion and change, its individuali ty became clothed in a ma terial form; and as individual bodies were compar ed to a garment, the world was the investiture of the Universal Spirit. Again, the body was compared to a vase or urn, the soul's recipient ; the world being the mighty bowl which received the descending Deity. In another i mage, ancient as the Grottoes of the Magi and the denunciations of Ezekiel, the world wa s as a dimly illuminated cavern, where shadows seem realities, and where the soul beco mes Page 371 of 621"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike forgetful of its celestial origin in proportion to its proneness to mat erial fascinations. By another, the period of the Soul's embod iment is as when exhalations are condensed, and the aerial element assumes the grosser form of water. But if vapor falls in water, it was held, water is again the birth of vapors, which ascend and adorn the Heavens. If our mort al existence be the death of the spirit, our death may be the renewal of its life; as physical bodies are exalted from earth to water, from water to air, from air to fire, so the man may rise into the Hero, the Hero into the God. In the course of Nature, the soul, to re-cover its lost estate, must pass through a series of trials and migrations. The scene of those trials is the Grand Sanctuar y of Initiations, the world: their primary agents are the elements; and Dionu sos, as Sovereign of Nature, or the sensuous world personified, is official Arbiter of the Mysteries, and guide of the soul, which he introduces into the bod y and dismisses from it. He is the Sun, that liberator of the elements, and his spiritual mediation was suggested b y the same imagery which made the Zodiac the supposed path of the spirits in their descent and their return, and Cancer and Capricorn the gates through which the y passed. He was not onl y Creator of the World, but guardian, liberator, and Saviour of the Soul. Ushered into the world am idst lightning and thunder, he became the Liberator celebrat ed in the Mysteries of Thebes, delivering earth from Winter's chain, conducting the nightl y chorus of the Stars and the celestial revolution of the y ear. His symbolism was the inexhaustibl e imagery employed to fill up the stellar devices of the Zodiac: he was the Vernal Bull, the Lion, the Ram, the Autumn al Goat, the Serpent: in short, the varied Deity, the resulting manifest ation personified, the all in the man y, the varied year, life passing into innumer able forms; essentiall y inferior to none, ye t changing with the seasons, and undergoing their periodical decay. He med iates and intercedes for man, and reconciles the Universal Unseen Mind with the individual ized spirit of which he is empha tically the Perfecter; a consumm ation which he effects, first through the vicissitudes of the elemental ordeal, the alterna te fire of Summ er and the sho wers of Winter, \"the trials or test of an im mortal Nature\"; and secondaril y and symbolically through the Mysteries. He holds not onl y the cup of generation, but also that of wisdom or initia tion, whose influence is contrary to that of the former, causing the soul to abhor its ma terial bonds, and to long for its return. The first was the Cup of Forgetfulness; while the second is the Urn of Aquarius, quaffed by the returning spirit, as by the returning Sun at the Winter Solstice, and embl ematic of the exchange of worldl y impressions for the recovered recollec tions of the glorious sights and enjoy ments of its pre- existence. Water nourishes and purifies; and the urn from which it flows w as thought worthy to be a symbol of Deit y, as of the Osiris-Canobus who with living water irrigated the soil of Eg ypt; and also an embl em of Hope that should cheer the dwellings of the dead. The second birth of Dionusos, like the rising of Osiris and Atys from the dead, and the raising of Kh r m, is a type of the spiritual regeneration of man. Psyche (the Soul), like ū ū Ariadne, had two lovers, an earthl y and an i mmortal one. The im mortal suitor is Dionusos, the Eros-Phanes of the Orphici, graduall y exalted by the progress of thought, out of the symbol of Sensuality into the torch-bearer of the Nuptials of the Gods; the Divine Page 372 of 621"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Influence which physically called the world into being, and which, awakening the soul from its Stygian trance, restores it from earth to Heaven. Thus the scientific theories of the ancients, expounded in the Mysteries, as to the origin of the soul, its descent, its sojourn here below, and its return, were not a mere barren contemplation of the nature of the world, and of the intelligen t beings existing there. They were not an idle speculation as to the order of the world, and about the soul, but a study of the means for arriving at the great object proposed, the perfecting of the soul; and, as a necessar y consequence, that of mor als and societ y. This Earth, to them, was not the Soul' s home, but its place of exile. Heaven was its home, and there was its birth-place. To it, it ought incessantl y to turn its eyes. Man wa s not a terrestrial plant. His roots were in Heaven. The soul had lost its wings, clogged by the viscosit y of matter. It would recover them when it extricated itself from matter and comm enced its upward flight. Matter being, in their view, as it was in that of St. Paul, the principle of all the passions that trouble reason, m islead the intell igence, and stain the purit y of the soul, the Mysteries taught man how to enfeeble the action of matter on the soul, and to restore to the latter its natural dominion. And lest the stains so contracted should continue after death, lustrations were used, fastings, expiations, macerations, continenc e, and above all, initiations. Many of these practices were at first mer ely symbolical, – material signs indicating the moral purity required of the Initiat es; but they afterward came to be regarded as actual productive causes of that purity. The effect of initiat ion was meant to be the same as that of philosoph y, to purif y the soul of its passions, to weaken the empire of the bod y over the divine portion of man, and to give him here below a happiness anticipa tory of the felicity to be one da y enjoyed by him, and of the future vision by him of the Divine Beings. And therefore Proclus and the other Platonists taught \"that the Mysteries and initiat ions withdrew souls from this mort al and material life, to re-unite them to the gods; and dissipated for the adepts the shades of ignorance by the splendors of the Deit y.\" Such were the precious fruits of the last Degree of the Mystic Science, – to see Nature in her springs and sources, and to becom e familiar with the causes of things and with real existences. Cicero says that the soul must exercise itself in the practic e of the virtues, if it would speedily return to its place of origin. It should, while imprisoned in the body, free itself therefro m by the contemplation of superior beings, and in some sort be divorced from the body and the senses. Those who remain enslaved, subj ugated by their passions and violating the sacred laws of religion and societ y, will re-ascend to Heaven, onl y after the y shall have been purified through a long succession of ages. The Initiate was required to emancip ate himself from his passions, and to free himself from the hindrances of the senses and of mat ter, in order that he migh t rise to the conte mplation of the Deity, or of that incorporeal and unchanging light in which live and subsist the causes of created natures. \"We must,\" says Porphyry, \"flee from everything sensual, that the soul ma y with ease re-unite itself with God, and live happil y with Him.\" \"This is the great work of initiat ion,\" says Hierocles; – \"to recall the soul to what is truly good and beautiful, and make it familiar therewith, and they its own; to deliver it from the pains and ills it endures here below, enchained in matter as in a dark prison; to facilit ate its return to Page 373 of 621"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the celestial splendors, and to establish it in the Fortunate Isles, by restoring it to its first estate. Thereb y, when the hour of death arrives, the soul, freed of its mor tal garment ing, which it leaves behind it as a legac y to earth, will rise buoyantly to its home among the Stars, there to re-take its ancient condition, and approach toward the Divine nature as far as man may do.\" Plutarch compares Isis to knowledge, and Typhon to ignorance, obscuring the light of the sacred doctrine whose 'blaze lights the soul of the Initiate. No gift of the gods, he holds, is so precious as the knowledge of the Truth, and that of the Nature of the gods, so far as our limited capacit ies allow us to rise toward the m. The Valentinians termed initiation LIGHT. The Initiate, says Psellus, beco mes an Epopt, when admi tted to see THE DIVINE LIGHTS. Clem ens of Alexandria, imitating the language of an Initiate in the Mysteries of Bacchus, and inviting this Initiate, whom he terms blind like Tiresias, to come to see Christ, Who will blaze upon his ey es with greater glory than the Sun, exclai ms: \"Oh Mysteries most truly holy! Oh pure Light! When the torch of the Dadoukos gleams, Heaven and the Deity are display ed to my eyes! I am initiated, and beco me holy!\" This was the true object of initia tion; to be sanctified, and TO SEE, that is, to have ju st and faithful conceptions of the Deit y, the knowledge of Whom was THE LIGHT of the Mysteries. It was promised the Initiate at Samothra ce, that he should become pure and ju st. Clemens says that by baptism, souls are illuminated , and led to the pure light with which mingles no darkness, nor an ything material. The Initiate, become an Epopt, was called A SEER. \"HAIL, NEW- BORN LIGHT!\" the Initiates cried in the Mysteries of Bacchus. Such was held to be the effect of comple te initiation. It lighted up the soul with ra ys from the Divinit y, and beca me for it, as it were, the e ye with which, according to the Pythagoreans, it con-templates the field of Truth; in its mystical abstractions, wherein it rises superior to the bod y, whose action on it, it annuls for the ti me, to re-enter into itself, so as entirel y to occupy itself with the view of the Divinit y, and the means of com ing to resemble Him. Thus enfeebling the domin ion of the senses and the passions over the soul, and as it were freeing the latter from a sordid slavery , and by the stead y practice of all the virtues, active and contemp lative, our ancient brethren strove to fit themselv es to return to the bosom of the Deity. Let not our objects as Masons fall below theirs. We use the s ymbols which they used; and teach the same great cardinal doctrines that they taught, of the existence of an intellectual God, and the immortality of the soul of man. If the details of their doctrines as to the soul seem to us to verge on absurdity, let us compare them with the common notions of our own day , and be silent. If it seems to us that they regarded the symbol in some cases as the thing s ymbolized, and wor shiped the sign as if it were itself Deity, let us reflect how insufficient are our own ideas of Deit y, and how we wor ship those ideas and images formed and fashioned in our own minds, and not the Deit y Himself: and if we are inclined to smile at the importan ce they attached to lustrations and fasts, let us pause and inquire whether the same weakness of human nature does not exist to-day, causing rites and ceremonies to be regarded as activel y efficient for the salvation of souls. And let us ever reme mber the words of an old writer, with which we conclude this lecture : \"It is a pleasure to stand on the shore, and to see ships tossed upon the sea: a pleasure to Page 374 of 621"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike stand in the window of a castle, and see a battle and the adventures thereof: but no pleasure is comp arable to the standing on the vantage- ground of TRUTH (a hill not to be commanded, and where the air is alwa ys clear and serene), and to see the errors and wanderings, and mists and tempests, in the vale below; so always that this prospect be with pity, and not with swelling or pride .

Whether the existence of evil is rightl y explained in this creed or in that, by Typhon the Great Serpent, by Ahriman and his A rmies of Wicked Spirits, by the Giants and Titans that war against Heaven, by the two co- existent Principles of Good and Evil, by Satan's temp tation and the fall of Man, by Lok and the Serpent Fenris, it is beyond the doma in of Masonry to decide, nor does it need to inquire. Nor is it within its Province to determ ine how the ultimate triumph of Light and Truth and Good, over Darkness and Error and Evil, is to be achieved; nor whether the Redeem er, looked and longed for by all nations, hath appeared in Judea, or is y et to com e. It reverences all the great reformers. It sees in Mo ses, the Lawgiver of the Jew s, in Confucius and Zoroaster, in Jesu s of Nazareth, and in the Arabian Iconoclast, Great Teachers of Moralit y, and Eminent Reformers, if no more: and allows ever y brother of the Order to assign to each such higher and even Divine Character as his Creed and Truth require. Thus Masonry disbelieves no truth, and teaches unbelief in no creed, except so far as such creed may lower its loft y estimate of the Deit y, degrade Him to the level of the passions of humanity, deny the high destiny of man, impugn the goodness and benevolence of the Supreme God, strike at those great columns of Masonry , Faith, Hope, and Charit y, or inculcate immorality, and disregard of the active duties of the Order. Masonry is a wor ship; but one in which all civilized men can unite; for it does not undertake to explain or dogmat ically to settle those great mysteries, that are above the feeble comprehension of our hum an intellect. It trusts in God, and HO PES; it BELIEVES, like a child, and is humble. It draw s no sword to compe l others to adopt its belief, or to be happy with its hopes. And it WAITS with patience to understand the mysteries of Nature and Nature's God hereafter. The greatest mysteries in the Universe are those which are ever going on around us; so trite and common to us that we never note the m nor reflect upon them. Wise men tell us of the laws that regulate the mot ions of the spheres, which, flashing in huge circles and spinning on their axes, are also ever darting with inconceivabl e rapidity through the infiniti es of Space; while we atoms sit here, and drea m that all was made for us . They tell us learnedl y of centripe tal and centrifugal forces , gravity and attract ion, and all the other sounding terms invented to hide a want of m eaning. There are other forces in the Universe than those that are mechan ical. Here are two minut e seeds, not much unlike in appearance, and two of larger size. Hand them to the learned Pundit, Chemistr y, who tells us how combustion goes on in the lungs, and plants are fed with phosphorus and carbon, and the alkalies and silex. Let her decompose them, analyze them, torture them in all the ways she knows. The net result of each is a littl e sugar, a litt le fibrin, a little water – carbon, potassium, sodium, and the like – one cares not to know what. We hide the m in the ground: and the slight rains moist en them, and the Sun shines upon them, and litt le slender shoots s pring up and gro w; – and what a miracle is the mere growth! – the force, the power, the capacity by which the little feeble shoot, that a small Page 377 of 621"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike worm can nip off with a single snap of its mandibl es, extracts from the earth and air and water the different elemen ts, so learnedl y catalogued, with which it increases in stature, and rises impercep tibly toward the sky. One grows to be a slender, fragile, feeble stalk, soft of texture, like an ordinar y weed; another a strong bush, of woody fibre, arm ed with thorns, and sturdy enough to bid defiance to the winds: the third a tender tree, subject to be blighted by the frost, and looked down upon by all the forest; while another spreads its rugged arms abroad, and cares for neither frost nor ice, nor the snows that for months lie around its roots. But lo! out of the brown foul earth, and colorless invisible air, and limpid rain-water, the chemistry of the seeds has extracted colors – four different shades of green, that paint the leaves which put forth in the spring upon our plants, our shrubs, and our trees. Later still come the flowers – the vivid colors of the rose, the beautiful brilliance of the carnation, the modest blush of the apple; and the splendid white of the orange. Whence come the colors of the leaves and flowers ? By what process of chem istry are they extracted from the carbon, the phosphorus, and the lime? Is it an y greater miracle to make something out of nothing? Pluck the flowers. Inhale the delicious perfumes ; each perfect, and all delicious. Whence have they come? By what comb ination of acids and alkalies could the che mist's laborator y produce them ? And now on two comes the fruit – the ruddy apple and the golden orange. Pluck them – open them! The texture and fabric how totall y different! The taste how entirel y dissimil ar – the perfume of each distinct from its flower and from the other. Whence the taste and this new perfum e? The same earth and air and water have been made to furnish a different taste to each fruit, a different perfume not only to each fruit, but to each fruit and its own flower. Is it any more a problem whence come thought and will and perception and all the phenom ena of the mind, than this, whence come the colors, the perfum es, the taste, of the fruit and flower? And lo! in each fruit new seeds, each gifted with the same wondrou s power of reproduction – each with the same wondrous forces wrapped up in it to be again in turn evolved. Forces that had lived three thousand y ears in the grain of wheat found in the wrappings of an Eg yptian mummy; forces of which learning and science and wisdom know no more than the y do of the nature and laws of action of God. What can we know of the nature, and how can we understand the powers and mode of operation of the human soul, when the glossy leaves, the pearl-white flower, and the golden fruit of the orange are miracles wholly beyond our compr ehension? We but hide our ignorance in a cloud of word s; – and the words too often are mer e combinations of sounds without any meaning. What is the centrifugal force? A tendency to go in a particular direction! What external \" force ,\" then, produces that tendenc y? What force draws the needle round to the north? What force moves the muscle that raises the arm, when the will determ ines it shall rise? Whence comes the will itself?

Our sense s are mysteries to us, and we are m ysteries to ourselves. Philosophy has taught us nothing as to the nature of our sensations, our perceptions, our cognizances, the origin of our thoughts and ideas, but words . By no effort or degree of reflection, never so long continued, can man become conscious of a personal identity in himself, separate and distinct from his body and his brain. We torture ourselves in the effort to gain an idea of ourselves, and weary with the exertion. Who has y et made us understand how, from the contact with a foreign body, the image in the eye, the wave of air i mpinging on the ear, particul ar particles entering the nostrils, and coming in contact with the palate, come sensations in the nerves, and from that, perception in the mind, of the animal or the man? What do we know of S ubstance? Men even doubt y et whether it exists. Philosophers tell us that our senses make known to us only the attributes of substance, extension, hardnes s, color, and the like; but not the thing itself that is extended, solid, black or white; as we know the attributes of the Soul, its thoughts and its perceptions, and not the Soul itself which perceives and thinks.

The mysteries of the Great Universe of God! H ow can we with our lim ited mental vision expect to grasp and comprehend them! Infinite SPACE, stretching out from us ever y way, without limit: infinite TIME, without beginning or end; and WE, HERE, and NOW, in the centre of each! An infinit y of suns, the nearest of which only diminish in size, viewed with the most powerful telescope : each with its retinue of worlds; infinite numbers of such suns, so remot e from us that their light would not reach us, journeying during an infinit y of time, while the light that has reached us, from some that we seem to see, has been upon its journey for fift y centuries: our world spinning upon its axis, and rushing ever in its circuit round the sun; and it, the sun, and all our system revolving round some great central point; and that, and suns, stars, and worlds evermore flashing onward with incredible rapidity through illimitable space: and then, in every drop of water that we drink, in ever y morsel of much of our food, in the air, in the earth, in the sea, incredible multitudes of living creatures, invisible to the naked eye, of a minuten ess beyond belief, yet organized, living, feeding, perhaps with consciousness of identit y, and memory and instinct.

Page 382 of 621"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Qu ∴ What is the first great Truth of the Sacred M ysteries? Ans ∴ No man hath seen God at any time. He is One, Eternal, All-Powerful, All-Wise, Infinitel y Just, Merciful, Benevolent, and Compassionat e, Creator and Preserver of all things, the Source of Light and Life, coextensive with Ti me and Space; Who thought, and with the Thought created the Universe and all living things, and the souls of men: THAT IS: – the PERM ANENT; while everything beside is a perpetual genesis. Qu ∴ What is the second great Truth of the Sacred Mysteries? Ans ∴ The Soul of Man is Imm ortal; not the result of organizat ion, nor an aggregate of modes of action of matt er, nor a succession of phenomena and perceptions; but an EXISTENCE, one and identica l, a living spirit, a spark of the Great Central Light, that hath entered info and dwells in the bod y; to be separated therefro m at death, and return to God who gave it: that doth not disperse nor vanish at death, like breath or a smoke, nor can be annihila ted; but still exists and possesses activi ty and intel ligence, even as it existed in God, before it was enveloped in the body. Qu ∴ What is the third great Truth in Masonry? Ans ∴ The impulse which directs to right conduct, and deters from crime, is not onl y older than the ages of nations and cities, but coeval with that Divine Being Who sees and rules both Heaven and earth. Nor did Tarquin less violate that Eternal Law, though in his reign there might have been no written law at Rome against such violence; for the principle that impels us to right conduct, and warns u s against guilt, springs out of the nature of things. It did not begin to be law when it was first written , nor wa s it originated ; but it is coeval with the Divine Intell igence itself. The consequence of virtue is not to be made the end thereof; and laudable performan ces must have deeper roots, motives, and instigations, to give them the stamp of virtues. Qu ∴ What is the fourth great Truth in Masonry ? Ans ∴ The moral truths are as absolute as the metaphysical truths. Even the Deit y cannot make it that there should be effects without a cause, or phenomena without substance. As little could He make it to be sinful and evil to respect our pledged word, to love truth, to moderate our pas sions. The principles of Moralit y are axio ms, like the principles of Geometry. The moral laws are the necessary relations that flow from the nature of things, and they are not created by, but have existed eternall y in God. Their continued existence does not depend upon the exercise of His WILL. Truth and Justice are of His ESSENCE. Not because we are feeble and God omn ipotent, is it our duty to obey His law. We may be forced, but are not under obligation, to obey the stronger. God is the principle of Moralit y, but not by His mere will, which, abstracted from all other of His attribut es, would be neither just nor unjust. Good is the expression of His will, in so far as that will is itself the expression of eternal, absolute, uncreated justice, which is in God, which His will did not create; but which it executes and promu lgates, as our will proclaim s and promu lgates and executes the idea of the good which is in us. H e has given us the law of Truth and Justice; Page 383 of 621"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike but He has not arbitraril y instituted that law. Justice is inherent in His will, because it is contained in His intelligen ce and wisdom, in His very nature and most intimate essence. Qu ∴ What is the fifth great Truth in Masonry? Ans ∴ There is an essential distinct ion between Good and Evil, what is just and what is unjust; and to this distinction is attach ed, for ever y intelligen t and free creature, the absolute obligation of conforming to what is good and ju st. Man is an intellig ent and free being, – free, because he is conscious that it is his dut y, and because it is made his duty , to obey the dictates of truth and ju stice, and therefore he must necessaril y have the power of doing so, which involves the power of not doing so;-capable of compreh ending the distinction between good and evil, justice and injustice, and the obligation which accompanies it, and of naturall y adhering to that obligation, independentl y of any contract or positive law; capable also of resisting the temptations which urge him toward evil and injustice, and of compl ying with the sacred law of eternal justice. That man is not governed by a resistless Fate or inexorable Destiny ; but is free to choose between the evil and the good: that Justice and Right, the Good and Beautiful, are of the essence of the Divinit y, like His Infinitude; and therefore they are laws to man: that we are conscious of our freedo m to act, as we are conscious of our identit y, and the continuanc e and connectedness of our existence ; and have the same evidence of one as of the other; and if we can put one in doubt, we have no certaint y of either , and ever ything is unreal: that we can deny our free will and free agency, only upon the ground that they are in the nature of things impossible; which would be to deny the Omnipotence of God. Qu ∴ What is the sixth great Truth of Masonry? Ans ∴ The necessit y of practising the mora l truths, is obligation . The moral truths; necessar y in the eye of reason, are obligator y on the will. The moral obligation, like the moral truth that is its foundation, is absolute . As the necessary truths are not more or less necessar y, so the obligation is not more or less obligator y. There are degrees of impor tance among different obligations; but none in the obligation itself. We are not nearly obliged, almost obliged. We are wholly so, or not at all. If there be any place of refuge to which we can escape from the obligation, it ceases to exist. If the obligat ion is absolute, it is immutable and universal. For if that of to-day may not be that of to-morrow, if what is obligator y on me may not be obligator y on you , the obligation would differ from itself, and be variable and contingent. This fact is the principle of all morality. That every act contrar y to right and justice, deserves to be repressed b y force, and punished when com mitted, equally in the absence of any law or contract: that man naturall y recognizes the distinction between the merit and demer it of actions, as he does that between justice and injustice, honesty and dishonesty ; and feels, without being taught, and in the absence of law or contract, that it is wrong for vice to be rewarded or go unpunished, and for virtue to be punished or left unrewarded: and that, the Deity being infinite ly just and good, it must follow as a necessary and inflexibl e law that punishmen t shall be the result of Sin, its inevitab le and natural effect and corollar y, and not a mere arbitrar y vengeance. Qu ∴ What is the seventh great Truth in Masonry? Page 384 of 621"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Ans ∴ The immutable law of God requires, that besides respecting the absolute rights of others, and being mer ely just, we s hould do good, be charitabl e, and obe y the dictates of the generous and noble sentim ents of the soul. Charity is a law, because our conscience is not satisfied nor at ease if we have not relieved the suffering, the distressed, and the destitute. It is to give that which he to whom you give has no right to take or demand . To be charitable is obligator y on us. We are the Almoners of God' s bounties. But the obligation is not so precise and inflexible as the obligation to be just . Charit y knows neither rule nor limit. It goes bey ond all obligation. Its beaut y consists in its libert y. \"He that loveth not, knoweth not God; FO R GOD IS LOVE. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" To be kindl y affectioned one to another with brotherl y love; to relieve the necessities of the need y, and be generous, liberal, and hospitable; to return to no man evil for evil; to rejoice at the good fortune of others, and sympathize with them in their sorrow s and reverses; to live peaceabl y with all men, and repa y injuries with benefits and kindness; these are the sublim e dictates of the Moral Law, taught from the infancy of the world, by Masonry. Qu ∴ What is the eighth great Truth in Masonry? Ans ∴ That the laws w hich control and regulate the Universe of God, are those of motion and harmon y. We see only the isolated incidents of things, and with our feeble and limited capacity and vision cannot discern their connection, nor the mighty chords that make the apparent discord perfect harmon y. Evil is merely apparent, and all is in realit y good and perfect. For pain and sorro w, persecution and hardships, affliction and destitution, sickness and death are but the means, by which alone the noblest virtues could be developed. Without them, and without sin and error, and wrong and outrage, as there can be no effect without an adequate cause, there could be neither patience under suffering and distress; nor prudence in difficult y; nor temperanc e to avoid excess; nor courage to meet danger; nor truth, when to speak the truth is hazardous; nor love, when it is met with ingratitude; nor charity for the needy and destitute; nor forbearance and forgiveness of injuries; nor toleration of erroneous opinions; nor charitable judgmen t and construction of men's motives and actions; nor patriotism , nor heroism, nor honor, nor self-denial, nor generosit y. These and most other virtues and excellenci es would have no existence, and even their names be unknown; and the poor virtues that still existed, would scarce deserve the name; for life would be one fiat, dead, low level, above which none of the lofty elements of human nature would emerg e; and man would lie lapped in contented indolence and idleness, a mer e worthless negative, instead of the brave, strong soldier against the grim legions of Evil and rude Difficult y. Qu ∴ What is the ninth great Truth in Masonry? Ans ∴ The great leading doctrine of this Degree; – that the JUSTICE, the WISDOM, and the MERCY of G od are alike infinite, alike perfect, and yet do not in the least jar nor conflict one with the other; but form a Great Perfect Trinity of Attributes, three and yet one: that, the principle of meri t and dem erit being absolute, and every good action deserving to be rewarded, and ever y bad one to be punished, and God being as ju st as He is Page 385 of 621"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike good; and yet the cases constantl y recurring in this world, in which cri me and cruelt y, oppression, t yranny, and inju stice are prosperous, happy , fortunate, and self- contented, and rule and reign, and enjoy all the blessings of God 's beneficence, while the virtuous and good are unfortunate, miserab le, destitute, pining away in dungeons, perishing with cold, and famishing with hunger, slaves of oppression, and instru ments and victims of the miscreants that govern; so that this world, if there were no existence beyond it, would be one great theatre of wrong and injustice, proving God wholl y disregardful of His own necessar y law of meri t and dem erit; – it follows that there must be another life in which these apparent wrongs shall be repaired: That all the powers of man's soul tend to infinit y; and his indomit able instinct of immortality, and the universal hope of another life, testified by all creeds, all poetry, all traditions, establish its certain ty; for man is not an orphan; but hath a Father near at hand: and the day must come when Light and Truth, and the Just and Good shall be victorious, and Darknes s, Error, Wrong, and Evil be annihilated, and known no more forever: That the Universe is one great Harmon y, in which, according to the faith of all nations, deep-rooted in all hearts in the primitive ages, Light will ulti mately prevail over Darkness, and the Good P rinciple over the Evil: and the myriad souls that have emanated from the Divinit y, purified and ennobled by the struggle here below, will again return to perfect bliss in the bosom of God, to offend against Whose laws will then be no longer possible. Qu ∴ What, then, is the one great lesson taught to us, as Ma sons, in this Degree? Ans ∴ That to that state and real m of Light and Truth and Perfection, which is absolutel y certain, all the good men on earth are tending; and if there is a law from whose operation none are exemp t, which inevitab ly conveys their bodies to darkness and to dust, there is another not less certain nor less po werful, which conducts their spirits to that state of Happiness and Splendor and Perfection, the bosom of their Father and their God. The wheels of Nature are not made to roll backward. Ever ything presses on to Eternit y. From the birth of Time an impe tuous current has set in, which bears all the sons of men toward that interminable ocean. Meanwhile, Heaven is attracting to itself whatever is congenial to its nature, is enriching itself by the spoils of the Earth, and collecting within its capacious bosom whatever is pure, perm anent, and divine, leaving nothing for the last fire to consume but the gross matter that creates concupiscence ; while everything fit for that good fortune shall be gathered and selected from the ruins of the world, to adorn that Eternal City. Let every Mason then obey the voice that calls him thither. Let us seek the things that are above, and be not content with a world that must shortly perish, and which we must speedily quit, while we neglect to prepare for that in which we are invited to dwell forever. While everything within us and around us rem inds us of the approach of death, and concurs to teach us that this is not our rest, let us hasten our preparations for another world, and earnestl y implore that help and strength from our Father, which alone can put an end to that fatal war which our desires have too long waged with our destin y. When these move in the same direction, and that which God' s will renders unavoidable shall becom e our choice, all things will be ours; life will be divested of its vanit y, and death disar med of its 'terrors.

Qu ∴ What is to us the chief symbol of man's ultimate redemption and regeneration? Ans ∴ The fraternal supper, of bread which nourishes, and of wine which refreshes and exhilara tes, symbolical of the time which is to come, when all mankind shall be one great harmon ious brotherhood; and teaching us these great lessons: that as matter changes ever, but no single ato m is annihilat ed, it is not rational to suppo se that the far nobler soul does not continue to exist beyond the grave: that many thousands w ho have died before us might claim to be joint owners with ourselves of the particles that compose our morta l bodies; for mat ter ever forms new combina tions; and the bodies of the ancient dead, the patriarchs before and since the flood, the kings and com mon people of all ages, resolved into their constituent elements, are carried upon the wind over all continents, and continual ly enter into and form part of the habitat ions of new s ouls, creating new bond s of sympathy and brotherhood between each man that lives and all his race. And thus, in the bread we eat, and in the wine we drink to- night ma y enter into and form part of us the identical particles of matter that once formed parts of the ma terial bodies called Moses, Confucius, Plato, Socrates, or Jesus of Nazareth. In the truest sense, we eat and drink the bodies of the dead; and cannot say that there is a single atom of our blood or body , the ownership of which some other soul migh t not dispute with us. It teaches us also the infinite beneficence of God who sends u s seed-ti me and harvest, each in its season, and makes His showers to fall and His sun to shine alike upon the evil and the good: bestowing upon us unsolicited His innum erable blessings, and asking no return. For there are no angels stationed upon the watch-towers of creation to call the world to prayer and sacrifice ; but He bestows His benefits in silence, like a kind friend who comes at night, and, leaving his gifts at the door, to be found b y us in the morning, goes quietl y away and asks no thanks, nor ceases his kind offices for our ingratitude. And thus the bread and wine teach us that our Mortal Bod y is no mor e WE than the house in which we live, or the garments that we wear; but the Soul is I, the ONE, identical, unchangeable, immortal emanation from the Deit y, to return to God and be forever happy, in His good tim e; as our mor tal bodies, dissolving, return to the elements from which the y came, their particles coming and going ever in perpetual genesis. To our Jewish Brethren, this supper is s ymbolical of the Passover: to the Christian Mason, of that eaten by Christ and His Disciples, when, celebrat ing the Passover, He broke bread and gave it to them, saying, \"Take! eat! this is My body:\" and giving the m the cup, He said, \"Drink y e all of it! for this is M y blood of the New Testam ent, which is shed for man y for the remission of sins;\" thus sy mbolizing the perfect harmon y and union between Himself and the faithful; and His death upon the cross for the salvation of man. The history of Masonry is the histor y of Philosoph y.

More consistent, and more simple in its mode of procedure, it has put an end to the vast allegorical pantheon of ancient mythologies, and itself become a science. None can deny that Christ taught a lofty morality. \"Love one another: forgive those that despitefull y use you and persecute you: be pure of heart, meek, humble, contented : lay not up riches on earth, but in Heaven: submit to the powers lawfull y over you: become like these little children, or ye cannot be saved, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven: forgive the repentant; and cast no stone at the sinner, if y ou too have sinned: do unto others as y e would have others do unto y ou:\" such, and not abstruse questions of theolog y, were His simple and subli me teachings. The early Christians followed in His footsteps. The first preachers of the faith had no thought of domina tion. Entirel y animated by His saying, that he among them should be first, who should serve with the greatest devotion, they were humbl e, modest, and charitab le, and they knew how to com municate this spirit of the inner man to the churches under their direction. These churches were at first but spontaneous m eetings of all Christians inhabiting the same locality. A pure and severe morality, mingled with religious enthusias m, was the character istic of each, and excited the admira tion even of their persecutors. Everything was in comm on among them; their property , their joys, and their sorrows. In the silence of night they met for instruction and to pray together. Their love- feasts, or fraternal repasts, ended these reunions, in which all differences in social position and rank were effaced in the presence of a paternal Divinit y. Their sole object was to make men better, by bringing them back to a simple worship, of which universal mora lity was the basis; and to end those numerous and cruel sacrifices which everywhere inundated with blood the altars of the gods. Thus did Christianit y reform the world, and obey the teachings of its founder. It gave to woman her proper rank and influence ; it regulated domest ic life; and by admitting the slaves to the love- feasts, it by degrees raised the m above that oppression under which half of mank ind had groaned for ages. This, in its purit y, as taught by Christ Himself, was the true pri mitive religion, as communicated by God to the Patriarchs. It was no new religion, but the reproduction of the oldest of all; and its true and perfect morality is the morality of Masonry , as is the mor ality of every creed of antiquit y. In the early days of Christianit y, there was an initiat ion like those of the pagans. Person s were ad mitted on special conditions only. To arrive at a comple te knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The initia tes were consequentl y divided into three classes; the first, Auditors , the second, Catechumens , and the third, the Faithful . The Auditors were a sort of novices, who were prepared by certain ceremonies and certain instruction to receive the dogm as of Christianit y. A portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechu mens; who, after particul ar purificat ions, received baptism, or the initiation of the theogenesis ( divine generation ); but in the grand mysteries of that religion, the incarnation, nativity, passion, and resurrection of Christ, none were initi ated but the Faithfu l . These doctrines, and the celebra tion of the Holy Sacram ents, particular ly the Eucharist, were kept with profound secrec y. These M ysteries were divided into two parts; the first styled the Mass of the Catechum ens; the second, the Mass of the Faithful.

There were found all the sacramen ts of the Catholic Church, even the breath of confir mation. The Priest of Mithras promised the Initiat es deliverance from sin, by means of confession and baptis m, and a future life of happiness or miser y. He celebrat ed the Oblation of bread, im age of the resurrection. The baptism of newly-born children, extreme unction, confession of sins, – all belonged to the Mithriac rites. The candidate was purified b y a species of baptis m, a mark was impressed upon his forehead, he offered bread and water, pronouncing certain mysterious words. During the persecutions in the early ages of Christianit y, the Christians took refuge in the vast catacom bs which stretched for miles in ever y direction under the city of Rome, and are supposed to have been of Etruscan origin. There, amid labyrinthine windings, deep caverns, hidden cha mbers, chapels, and tombs, the persecuted fugitives found refuge, and there they performed the cere monies of the Mysteries. The Basilideans, a sect of Christians that arose soon after the time of the Apostles, practised the Mysteries, with the old Eg yptian legend. The y symbolized Osiris by the Sun, Isis by the Moon, and T yphon by Scorpio; and wore crystals bearing these e mblems, as amulets or talis mans to protect them from danger; upon which were also a brillian t star and the serpent. The y were copied from the talismans of Persia and Arabia, and given to ever y candidate at his initiation. Irenæus tells us that the Simon ians, one of the earliest sects of the Gnostics, had a Priesthood of the M ysteries. Tertullian tells us that the Valentinians, the most celebrated of all the Gnostic schools, imitated, or rather perverted, the Mysteries of Eleusis. Irenæus informs us, in several curious chapters, of the Mysteries practised by the Marcosians; and Origen gives much information as to the Mysteries of the Ophites; and there is no doubt that all the Gnostic sects had Mysteries and an initia tion. They all claimed to posse ss a secret doctrine, coming to them directly from Jesus Christ, different from that of the Gospels and Epistles, and superior to those com munications, which in their eyes, were mere ly exoteric. This secret doctrine they did not communicate to ever y one; and among the extensive sect of the Basilideans hardly one in a thousand knew it, as we learn from Irenæus. We know the name of only the highest class of their Initiates. They were sty led Elect or Elus [ Ἐ κλεκτοί] Strangers to the World and [ξένοι ἐ ν κ ό σμ ῳ ]. They had at least three Degrees – the Material , the Intellectua l , and the Spiritual , and the lesser and greater Mysteries; and the number of those who attained the highest Degree was quite small. Baptism was one of their most important ceremon ies; and the Basilideans celebra ted the 10th of January , as the anniversar y of the day on which Christ was baptized in Jordan. They had the ceremon y of laying on of hands, by way of purification; and that of the mystic banque t, emblem of that to which the y believed the Heavenly Wisdom would one day admit them, in the fullness of things [Πλ ή ρωμα].

The discipline of the secret was the concealm ent ( occultat io ) of certain tenets and ceremonies. So says Clemens of Alexandria. To avoid persecution, the early Christians were co mpelled to use great precaution, and to hold meetings of the Faithful [ of the Household of Faith ] in private places, under conceal ment by darknes s. They assembled in the night, and they guarded against the intrusion of false brethren and profane persons, s pies who migh t cause their arrest. The y conversed together figurativel y, and by the use of symbols, lest cowans and eavesdroppers might overhear: and there existed among them a favored class, or O rder, who were initiated into certain Mysteries which they were bound by solemn promise not to disclose, or even converse about, except with such as had received them under the same sanction. They were called Brethren , the Faithfu l , Stewards of the Mysteries , Superintendents , Devotees of the Secret , and ARC HITECTS. In the Hiera rchiæ , attributed to St. Dion ysius the Areopagite, the first Bishop of Athens, the tradition of the sacram ent is said to have been divided into three Degrees, or grades, purification , initiation , and accomplishment or perfection ; and it mentions also, as part of the ceremon y, the bringing to sight . The Apostolic Constitutions, attributed to Clemens, Bishop of Rom e, describe the earl y church, and say : \"These regulations must on no account be communicated to all sorts of persons, because of the M ysteries contained in them.\" They speak of the Deacon's duty to keep the doors, that none uninitia ted should enter at the oblation. Ostiarii , or doorkeepers, kept guard, and gave notice of the time of pray er and church-assembli es; and also by private signal, in times of persecution, gave notice to those within, to en-able them to avoid danger. The M ysteries were open to the Fideles or Faithful only; and no spectators were allowed at the com munion. Tertullian, who died about A. D. 216, say s in his Apology : \"None are admitted to the religious Mysteries without an oath of secrec y. We appeal to your Thracian and Eleusinian Mysteries; and we are especial ly bound to this caution, because if we prove faithless, we should not only provoke Heaven, but draw upon our heads the utmost rigor of human displeasure. And should strangers betra y us? They know nothing but by report and hearsay . Far hence, ye Profane! is the prohibition from all holy Mysteries.\" Clemens, Bishop of Alexandria, born about A. D. 191, sa ys, in his Stromata , that he cannot explain the Mysteries, because he should thereb y, according to the old proverb, put a sword into the hands of a child. He frequentl y compar es the Discipline of the Secret with the heathen Mysteries, as to their internal and recondite wisdom. Whenever the early Christians happened to be in compan y with strangers, more properly termed the Profane , they never spoke of their sacram ents, but indicated to one another what they meant by means of symbols and secret watchwords, disguisedly , and as b y direct communication of mind with mind, and by enigmas.

Let the Catechu mens, and those who have not been admitted or initiated, go forth.\" Archelaus, Bishop of Cascara in Mesopotamia, who, in the year 278, conducted a controvers y with the Manichæans, said: \"These M ysteries the church now com municates to him who has pas sed through the introductor y Degree. The y are not explained to the Gentiles at all; nor are the y taught openly in the hearing of Catechu mens; but much that is spoken is in disguised terms, that the Faithful [Πιστοί], who po ssess the knowledge, may be still more inform ed, and those who are not acquainted with it, may suffer no disadvantage.\" Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, was born in the year 315, and died in 386. In his Catechesis he says: \"The Lord spake in parables to His hearers in general; but to His disciples He explained in private the parables and allegories which He spoke in public. The splendor of glory is for those who are earl y enlightened: obscurit y and darkness are the portion of the unbelievers and ignorant. Just so the church discovers its M ysteries to those who have advanced beyond the class of Catechu mens: we emplo y obscure terms with others.\" St. Basil, the Great Bishop of Cæsarea, born in the year 326, and d ying in the year 376, says: \"We receive the dogmas transmi tted to us by writing, and those which have descended to us from the Apostles, beneath the mystery of oral tradition: for several things have been handed to us without writing, lest the vulgar, too fam iliar with our dogmas, should lose a due respect for them... This is what the uninitiat ed are not permi tted to contemplate; and how should it ever be proper to write and circulate among the people an account of them?\" St. Gregor y Nazianzen, Bishop of Con stantinopl e, A.

To have taught them openly , would have been to betray them.\" And he refers to the Ark of the Covenant, and says that it signified a Mystery, or secret of God, s hadowed over by the cherubi m of glory , and honored by being veiled. St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine speak of initia tion more than fifty times. St. Ambrose writes to those who are initia ted; and initiat ion was not mer ely baptism, or adm ission into the church, but it referred to initiation into the Mysteries. To the baptized and initiated the Mysteries of religion were unveiled; they were kept secret from the Catechu mens; who were per mitted to hear the Scriptures read and the ordinary discourses delivered, in which the Mysteries, reserved for the Faithful, were never treated of. When the services and prayers were ended, the Catechum ens and spectators all withdrew. Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, was born in 354, and died in 417. He say s: \"I wish to speak openly : but I dare not, on account of those who are not initiated. I shall therefore avail myself of disguised ter ms, discoursing in a shadowy manner... Where the hol y Mysteries are celebrated, we drive awa y all uniniti ated person s, and then close the doors.\" He men tions the acclam ations of the initiated ; \"which,\" he says, \"I here pass over in silence; for it is forbidden to disclose such things to the Profane.\" Palladius, in his life of Chrysostom, records, as a great outrage, that, a tumult having been excited against him by his enemies, they forced their way into the penetralia , where the uninitiated beheld what was not proper for the m to see; and Chr ysostom mentions the same circumstance in his epistle to Pope Innocent. St. Cyril of Alexandria, who wa s made Bishop in 412, and died in 444, say s in his 7th Book against Julian: \"These Mysteries are so profound and so exalted, that they can be comprehended by those only who are enlighten ed. I shall not, therefore, attempt to speak of what is so admirable in them, lest by discovering them to the uniniti ated, I should offend against the injunction not to give what is holy to the impure, nor cast pearls before such as cannot estimate their worth... I should say much more, if I were not afraid of being heard by those who are uninitiated : because men are apt to deride what they do not understand. And the ignorant, not being aware of the weakness of their minds, condemn what the y ought most to venerate.\" Theodoret, Bishop of C yropolis in Syria, was born in 393, and made Bishop in 420. In one of his three Dialogues, called the Immutable, he introduces Orthodoxus , speaking thus: \"Answer me, if you please, in mystical or obscure ter ms: for perhaps there are some persons present who are not initiat ed into the Mysteries.\" And in his preface to Ezekiel, tracing up the secret discipline to the com mencement of the Christian era, he says: \"These Mysteries are so august, that we ought to keep them with the greatest caution.\" Page 392 of 621"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Minucius Felix, an e minent lawyer of Rom e, who lived in 212, and wrote a defence of Christianit y, says: \"Many of them [the Christians] know each other by tokens and signs ( notis et insignibus ), and the y form a friendship for each other, al most before they becom e acquainted.\" The Latin Word, tessera , originall y meant a square piece of wood or stone, used in making tesselated pavemen ts; afterward a tablet on which anything was written, and then a cube or die. Its most general use was to designate a piece of meta l or wood, s quare in shape, on which the watchword of an Army was inscribed; whence tessera came to mean the watchword itself. There was also a tessera hospitalis , which was a piece of wood cut into two parts, as a pledge of friendship. Each party kept one of the parts; and they swore mutual fidelity by Jupiter. To break the tessera was considered a dissolution of the friendship. The earl y Christians used it as a Mark, the watchword of friendship. With them it was generall y in the shape of a fish, and made of bone. On its face was inscribed the word Ἰ χθ ῦ ς, a fish, the initials of which represented the Greek words, Ι ησο ῦ ς Χριστ ὸ ς Θεο ῦ Υ ἱὸ ς Σωτ ή ρ; Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour . St. Augustine ( de Fide et Symbolis ) says: \"This is the faith which in a few words is given to the Novices to be kept b y a symbol; these few words are known to all the Faithful; that by believing they may be submissive to God; by being thus submissive, they may live rightly; by living rightly, they may purify their hearts and with a pure heart m ay understand what they believe.\" Maximus Taurinus sa ys: \"The tessera is a s ymbol and sign by which to distinguish between the Faithful and the Profane.\" There are three Degrees in Blue Masonry ; and in addition to the two word s of two syllables each, embod ying the binar y, three, of three syllables each.

There are three principal officers of the Lodge, three lights at the Altar, three gates of the Temple, all in the East, West, and South. The three lights represent the Sun, the Moon, and Mercury ; Osiris, Isis, and Horu s; the Father, the Mother, and the Child; Wisdom, Strength, and Beaut y; Hakamah, Binah, and Daath; Gedulah, Geburah, and Tepareth. The candidate makes three circuits of the Lodge: there were three assassins of Khir-Om, and he was slain by three blows while seeking to escape by the three gates of the Te mple. The ejaculation at his grave was repeated three times. There are three divisions of the Te mple, and three, five, and seven Steps.

This continual reproduction of the number three is not accidental, nor without a profound meaning: and we shall find the same repeated in all the Ancient philosophies. The Egyptian Gods formed Triads, the third member in each proceeding from the other two. Thus we have the Triad of Th ebes, Amun, Maut, and Kharso; that of Philae, Osiris, Isis, and Horns; that of Elephantin and the Cataracts, Neph, Sate, and Anouk . ē ē Page 393 of 621"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Osiris, Isis, and Horu s were the Father, Mother, and Son; the latter being Light, the Soul of the World, the Son, the Protogonos or First-Begotten. Sometimes this Triad was regarded as SPIRIT, or the active Principle or Generative Power; MATTER, or the PA SSIVE Principle or Productive Capacit y; and the Universe, which proceeds from the two Principles. We also find in Egypt this Triad or Trinit y; Ammon-Ra, the Creator; Osiris-Ra, the Giver of Fruitfulness; Horus-Ra, the Queller of Light; symbolized by the Summ er, Autumn, and Spring Sun. For the Eg yptians had but three Season s, the three gates of the Temple; and on account of the different effects of the Sun on those three Seasons, the Deit y appears in these three forms. The Phœnician Trinity was Ulomos, Chusoros, and the Egg out of which the Universe proceeded. The Chaldæan Triad consisted of Bel, [the Persian Zervana Akherana], Oromasdes, and Ahriman ; the Good and Evil Principle alike outflowing from the Father, b y their equilibriu m and alterna ting preponderance to produce harmon y. Each was to rule, in turn, for equal periods, until finally the Evil Principle should itself become good. The Chaldæan and Persian oracles of Zoroaster give us the Triad, Fire, Light, and Ether. Orpheus celebrates the Triad of Phanes, Ourano s, and Kronos. Corr y says the Orphic Trinity consisted of Metis, Phanes, and Ericapaeus; Will, Light or Love, and Life. Acusilaus m akes it consist of Metis, Eros, and Æ ther: Will, Love, and Ether. Pherey cides of Syros, of Fire, Water, and Air or Spirit. In the two former we readil y recognize Osiris and Isis, the Sun and the Nile. The first three of the Persian Amshaspands were BAHMAN, the Lord of LIG HT; Ardibehest, the Lord of FIRE; and Shariver, the Lord of S PLENDOR. These at once lead us back to the Kabala. Plutarch says: \"The better and diviner nature consists of three; the Intelligibl e ( i.e. that which exists within the Intellec t only as yet), and Matter; το Νοητος and Ὕ λη, and that which proceeds from these, which the Greeks call Kosmos: of which Plato calls the Intelligible, the Idea, the Exe mplar, the Father: Matter, the Mother, the N urse, and the receptac le and place of generation: and the issue of these two, the Offspring and Genesis.\" The Pythagorean fragments say: \"Therefore, before the Heaven was made, there existed Idea and Matter, and God the Demiourgos [workman or active instrum ent], of the former. He mad e the world out of mat ter, perfect, only-begotten, with a soul and intellec t, and constituted it a divinity.\" Plato gives us Thought, the Father; Primitive Matter, the Mother; and Ko smos, the Son, the issue of the two Principles. Kosmos is the ensouled Universe.

Aurelius says the Demiourgos or Creator is triple, and the three Intellects are the three Kings: He who exists; He who pos sesses; He who beholds. The first is that which exists b y its essence; the second exists in the first, and contains or possesses in itself the Universal of things; all that afterward becomes: the third beholds this Universal, formed and fashioned intellectually, and so having a separate existence. The Third exists in the Second, and the Second in the First. The most ancient Trinitarian doctrine on record is that of the Brahmins. The Eternal Supreme Essence, called PARABR AHMA, BRAH M, PARATM A, produced the Universe by self-reflection, and first revealed himself as BRA HMA, the Creating Power, then as VISHNU, the Preserving Power, and lastly as SIVA, the Destroying and Renovating Power; the three Modes in which the Suprem e Essence reveals himself in the material Universe; but which soon cam e to be regarded as three distinct Deities. These three Deities they styled the TRIMURTI, or TRIAD. The Persians received from the Indians the doctrine of the three principles, and changed it to that of a principle of Life, which was individuali zed by the Sun, and a principle of Death, which was sy mbolized by cold and darknes s; parallel of the mora l world; and in which the continual and alternating struggle between light and darknes s, life and death, seemed but a phase of the great struggle between the good and evil principles, embodied in the legend of ORMUZD and A HRIMA N. MITHRA S, a Median reformer, was deified after his death, and invested with the attributes of the Sun; the different astronomical phenomena being figuratively detailed as actual incidents of his life; in the same manner as the history of BUDDHA was invented among the Hind s. ū The Trinity of the Hind s became among the Ethiopians and Abyssinians NEPH-AMON, ū PHTHA, and NEITH – the God CREATOR, whose emblem was a ram – MATTER, or the primitive mud, symbolized by a globe or an egg, and THOUGHT, or the LIGHT which contains the germ of everything; triple manifestation of one and the same God (ATHO M), considered in three aspects, as the creative power , goodnes s , and wisdo m . Other Deities were speedil y invented; and among them OSIRIS, represented by the Sun, Isis, his wife, by the Moon or Earth, TYPHO N, his Brother, the Principle of Evil and Darknes s, who was the son of O siris and Isis. And the Trinit y of OSIRIS, ISI S, and HORUS became subsequentl y the Chief Gods and objects of worship of the Egyptians. The ancient Etruscans (a race that emigra ted from the Rhætian Alps into Italy, along who se route evidences of their migration have been discovered, and whose language none have yet succeeded in reading) acknowledged only one Supreme God; but the y had im ages for His different attributes, and temp les to these images. Each town had one National Temple, dedicated to the three great attributes of God, STREN GTH, RICHES, and WISDO M, or Tina , Talna , and Minerva . The National Deity was always a Triad under one roof; and it was the same in Egypt, where one Supreme God alone was acknowledged, but was worshipped as a Triad, with different names in each different home.

The Chinese Sabæans represented the Supreme Deity as composed of CHA NG-TI, the Supreme Sovereign ; TIEN, the Heavens ; and TAO, the Universal Supreme Reason and Principle of Faith ; and that from Chaos, an im mense silence, an imm easurable void. without perceptible forms, alone, infinite, immutable, moving in a circle in illimitable space, without change or alterat ion, when vivified by the Principle of Truth, issued all Beings, under the influence of TAO, Principle of Faith, who produced one, one produced two, two produced three, and three produced all that is. The Sclavono-Vendes t ypified the Trinit y by the three heads of the God TRIGLAV; and the Pruczi or Prussians by the Tri- une God, PERK OUN, P IKOLLOS, and POTRIM POS, the Deities of Light and Thunde r , of Hell and the Earth , its fruits and ani mals: and the Scandinavians by ODIN, FREA, and THOR. In the KABALAH, or the Hebrew traditiona l philosoph y, the Infinite Deity, beyond the reach of the Human Intellect, and without Name, Form, or Limitation, was represented as developing Himself, in order to create, and by self-limitation, in ten em anations or out- flowings, called SEPHIROTH, or rays . The first of these, in the world AZILUTH, that is, within the Deity, was KETHER, or the Crown , by which we understand the Divine Will or Potency. Next cam e, as a pair, HAKEMA H and BAINAH, ordinaril y translated \"Wisdom\" and \"Intelligence,\" the form er termed the FATHER, and the latter the MOTHER. HAKEMAH is the active Power or Energy of Deity , by which He produces within Himself Intellection or Thinking: and BAIN AH, the passive Capacity , from which, acted on by the Power, the Intellection flows. This Intellec tion is called DAATH: and it is the \"WOR D,\" of Plato and the Gnostics; the unuttered word, within the Deity. Here is the origin of the Trinity of the Father, the Mother or Holy Spirit, and the Son or Word. Another Trinity was composed of the fourth Sephirah, GEDULA H or KH ASED, Benignit y or Mercy , also term ed FATHER ( Aba ); the fifth, GEBUR AH, Severity or Strict Justice , also termed the MOTHER ( Imma ); and the sixth, the SO N or Issue of these, TIPHARETH, Beauty or Harmony . \"Every thing,\" says the SO HAR, \"proceeds according to the Mystery of the Balance\" – that is, by the equilibrium of Opposites: and thus from the Infinite Mercy and the Infinite Justice, in equilibrium , flows the perfect Harmon y of the Universe. Infinite POWER, which is Lawless, and Infinite WISDOM, in Equilibriu m, also produce BEAUTY or HAR MONY, as Son, Is sue, or Result – the Word, or utterance of the Thought of God. P ower and Justice or Severit y are the same : Wisdom and Mercy or Benignit y are the same; – in the Infinite Divine Nature.

Basilides, the Christian Gnostic, taught that there were seven emana tions from the Supreme Being: The First-born, Thought , the Word, Reflection, Wisdom, Power, and Righteousness [Πρωτογονος, Νους, Λογο ς, Φρονη σις, Σοφια, Δυναμυς, and Δικαιοσ ύ νη Protogonos, Nou s, Logos, Phronesis, Sophia, Dunamis, and Dikarosun ]; from whom ē emanated other Intelligences in succession, t o the number, in all, of three hundred and sixty-five; which were God manifest ed, and composed the Plenitude of the Divine Emanations, or the God Abraxas; of which the Thought [or Intellect, Νους . .

Basilides held that out of the unrevealed God, w ho is at the head of the world of emanations, and exalted above all conception or designation [ Ὁ ἀ κατον ό μαστος, ἄῤῥ ητος] were evolved seven living, self-subsistent, ever-active hypostatized powers: FIRST: THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS. 1st.

These Seven Po wers (Δυνάμε ις . . Dunameis), with the Primal Ground out of which the y were evolved, constituted in his scheme the Πρωτη Ὀ γδο ὰ ς [Prote Ogdoas], or Fir st Octave, the root of all Existence. From this point, the spiritual life proceeded to evolve out of itself continual ly many gradations of existence, each lower one being still the impression, the antetype , of the i mmediate higher one. He supposed there were 365 of these regions or gradations, expr essed b y the mystical word Αβρ αξας [Abraxas]. The Αβραξας is thus interpreted, by the usual method of reckoning Greek letters numerically... α, 1 . . β, 2 . . ρ, 100 . . α, 1 . . ξ, 60 . . α , 1 . . ς, 200=365: which is the whole Emanation-World, as the develop ment of the Supreme Being. In the system of Basilides, Light, Life, Soul, and Good were opposed to Darkness, Death, Matter, and Evil, throughout the whole course of the Universe. According to the Gnostic view, God wa s represented as the imma nent, incompr ehensible and original source of all perfection; the unfatho mable ABYSS (βυθος . . buthos), according to Valentinus, exalted above all possibilit y of designation; of whom, properly speaking, nothing can be predicated ; the ἀ κατον ό μαστος of Basi lides, the ὢ ν of Philo. From this incompreh ensible Essence of God, an immediate transition to finite things is Page 398 of 621"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike inconceivab le. Self- limitation is the first beginning of a com munication of life on the part of God – the first pas sing of the hidden Deity into man ifestation; and from this proceeds all further self-developing manifestation of the Divine Essence. From this pri mal link in the chain of life there are evolved, in the first place, the man ifold powers or attributes inherent in the divine Essence, which, until that first self-compr ehension, were all hidden in the Abyss of His Essence. Each of these attributes presents the whole divine Essence under one particular aspect; and to each, therefore, in this respect, the title of God ma y appropriate ly be applied. These Divine Powers evolving themselv es to self-subsistence, become thereupon the germs and principles of all further developm ents of life. The life contained in them unfolds and individual izes itself more and more, but in such a wa y that the successive grades of this evolution of life continuall y sink lower and lower; the spirits become feebler, the further they are removed from the first link in the series. The first man ifestation they termed πρ ῶ τη κατάληψις ἑ αυτο ῦ [ p r o t ē k a t a l ē p s i s h e a u t o u ] or πρ ῶ τον καταληπτ ὸ ν το ῦ θεου [ p r o t o n K a t a l ē p t o n t o u T h e o u ]; which was hy postatically represented in a νο ῦ ς or λ ό γος, [ Nous or Logo s ]. In the Alexandrian Gnosis, the Platonic notion of the ὕ λη [Hul ] predominates. This is the ē dead, the unsubstantial – the boundary th at limits from without the evolution of life in its graduall y advancing progression, whereb y the Perfect is ever evolving itself into the less Perfect. This ὕ λη again, is represented under various images; – at one time as the darkness that exists alongside of the light; at another, as the void [κένωμα, κεν ὸ ν... Kenoma, Kenon], in opposition to the Fullness, [Πλ ή ρωμα... Pl roma] of the Divine Life; or as the ē shadow that accompanies the light; or as the chaos, or the sluggish, stagnant, dark wa ter. This matter, dead in itself, possesses by its own nature no inherent tendenc y; as life of every sort is foreign to it, itself makes no encroachm ent on the Divine. As, however, the evolutions of the Divine Life (the essences developing themse lves out of the progressive emanation) becom e feebler, the further the y are removed from the first link in the series; and as their connection with the first becom es looser at each successive step, there arises at the last step of the evolution, an imperfe ct, defective product, which, unable to retain its connection with the chain of Divine Life, sinks from the World of Eons into the ma terial chaos: or, according to the same notion, somewhat differentl y expressed [according to the Ophites and to Bardesanes], a drop from the fullness of the Divine life bubbles over into the bordering void. Hereupon the dead mat ter, by commixture with the living principle, which it wanted, first of all receives animation. But, at the same time, also, the divine, the living, becomes corrupted by mingling with the chaotic mass. Existence now multip lies itself. There arises a subordinate, defective life; there is ground for a new world; a creation starts into being, beyond the confines of the world of emana tion. But, on the other hand, since the chaotic principle of matter has acquired vitality, there now arises a more distinct and more active opposition to the God-like – a barel y negative, blind, ungodly nature- power, which obstinatel y resists all influence of the Divine; hence, as products of the spirit of the ὕ λη, (of the πνε ῦ μα ὕ λικον . . Pneuma Hulikon), are Satan, malignant spirits, wicked men, in none of whom is there any reason-able or moral principle, or any principle of a rational will; but blind passions alone have the ascendanc y . In them there is the same conflict, as the schem e of Platonis m supposes, between the soul under the guidance of Page 399 of 621"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Divine reason [the νο ῦ ς... Nous], and the soul blindl y resisting reason – between the πρ ό νοια [pronoia] and the αναγη [anag ], the Divine Principle and the natural. ē The Syrian Gnosis a ssumed the existence of an active, turbulent kingdom of evil, or of darkness, which, b y its encroachm ents on the kingdom of light, brought about a commixture of the light with the darknes s, of the God-like with the ungodlike. Even among the Platonists, some thought that along with an organized, inert matter, the substratum of the corporeal world, there existed from the beginning a blind, lawless mot ive power, an ungodlike soul, as its original motive and active principle. As the inorganic matter was organized into a corporeal world, b y the plastic power of the Deity, so, by the same power, law and reason were communicated to that turbulent, irrationa l soul. Thus the chaos of the ὕ λη was transformed into an organized world, and that blind soul into a rational principle, a mundane soul, ani mating the Universe. As from the latter proceeds all rational, spiritual life in human ity, so from the forme r proceeds all that is irrational, all that is under the blind sway of passion and appetite; and all malignant spirits are its progeny . In one respect all the Gnostics agreed: they all held; that there was a world purel y emanating out of the vital develop ment of God, a creation evolved directly out of the Divine Essence, far exalted above an y outward creation produced by God's plastic power, and conditioned by pre-existing matter. They agreed in holding that the framer of this lower world was not the Father of that higher world of emana tion; but the Demiurge [Δεμιουργος], a being of a kindred nature with the Universe framed and governed b y him, and far inferior to that higher system and the Father of it. But some, setting out from ideas which had long prevailed among certain Jews of Alexandria, supposed that the Suprem e God created and governed the world b y His ministering spirits, b y the angels. At the head of these angels stood one who had the direction and control of all; therefore called the Artificer and Governor of the World. This Demiurg e they compared with the plastic, animating mundane spirit of Plato and Platonists [the δε ύ τερος θε ὸ ς . . Deuteros Theos; the θε ὸ ς γενητ ὸ ς; Theos Genetos], who, moreover, according to the Tim æus of Plato, strives to represent the IDEA of the Divine Reason, in that which is becoming (as contradistinguished from that which is ) and tempor al. This angel is a representat ive of the Supreme God, on the lower stage of existence : he does not act independentl y, but mer ely according to the ideas inspired in him by the Supreme God; just as the plastic, mundan e soul of the Platonists creates all things after the pattern of the ideas communicated by the Supreme Reason [Νο ῦ ς... Nous – the ὅ ἔ στι ζ ῶ ον... ho esti z on – the; ō παράδειγμα... paradeig ma, of the Divine Reason h ypostatized]. But these ideas transcend his limited essence; he cannot understand the m; he is merel y their unconscious organ; and therefore is unable himself to compr ehend the whole scope and meaning of the work which he perfor ms. As an organ under the guidance of a higher inspiration, he reveals higher truths than he himself can compr ehend. The mass of the Jews, they held, recognized not the angel, b y whom, in all the Theophanies of the Old Testam ent, God revealed Himself ; they knew not the Demiurge in his true relation to the hidden Supreme God, who never reveals Himself in the sensible world. The y confounded the type and the archetype, the symbol and the idea. They rose no higher than the Dem iurge; they took him to be the Suprem e God Himself. But the spiritual men among them, on the contrar y, Page 400 of 621"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike clearly perceived, or at least divined , the ideas veiled under J udaism; they rose bey ond the Demiurg e, to a knowledge of the Supreme God; and ar e therefore properl y His worshippers [θεραπευταί ... Therapeuta i]. Other Gnostics, who had not been followers of the Mosaic religion, but who had, at an earlier period, fram ed to themselves an oriental Gnosis, regarded the Demiurge as a being absolutel y hostile to the Supreme God. He and his angels, notwithstanding their finite nature, wish to establish their independence: they will tolerate no foreign rule within their realm. Whatever of a higher nature descends into their kingdom, they seek to hold imprisoned there, lest it should raise itself above their narrow precincts. Probably , in this system, the kingdom of the Demiurg ic Angels corresponded, for the most part, with that of the deceitful Star-Spirits, who seek to rob man of his freedom, to beguile him by various arts of deception, and who exercise a tyrannical sway over the things of this world. Accordingl y, in the system of these Sabæans, the seven Planet- Spirits, and the twelve Star- Spirits of the zodiac, who sprang from an irregular connection between the cheated Fetahil and the Spirit of Darknes s, play an impor tant part in everything that is bad. The Demiurge is a limited and limiting being, proud, jealous, and revengeful; and this his character betrays itself in the Old Testam ent, which, the Gnostics held, came from him. They transferred to the Demiurge himself, whatever in the idea of God, as presented by the Old Testament, appeared to them defective. Against his will and rule the ὕ λη was continuall y rebelling, revolting without control against the dominion which he, the fashioner, would exercise over it, casting off the yoke imposed on it, and destro ying the work he had begun. The same jealous being, limited in his power, ruling with despotic sway, they imagined they saw in nature. He strives to check the ger mination of the divine seeds of life which the Supreme God of H oliness and Love, who has no connection whatever with the sensible world, has scattered among men. That perfect God was at most known and w orshipped in Mysteries by a few spiritual men. The Gospel of St. John is in great measure a polemi c against the Gnostics, whose different sects, to solve the great proble ms, the creation of a ma terial world b y an immaterial Being, the fall of man, the incarnation, the rede mption and restoration of the spirits called men, admitted a long series of intellig ences, intervening in a series of spiritual operations; and which they designated by the names, The Beginning , the W ord , the Only-Begotten , Life , Light , and Spirit [Ghost]: in Greek, Ἀ ρκ ή , Λ ό γος, Μονογεν ή ς, Ζω ή , Φ ῶ ςand Πνευμα [Arch , Logos, Monogen s, Z e, Ph s, and Pneuma]. St. John, at the beginning of his ē ē ō ō Gospel, avers that it was Jesus Christ who existed in the Beginning; that He wa s the WORD of God by which everything was made; that He was the Only-Begotten, the Life and the Light, and that He diffuses among men the Holy Spirit [or Ghost], the Divine Life and Light. So the Pl roma [ ē Πλ ή ρωμα], Plenitude or Fullness, was a favorite ter m with the Gnostics, and Truth and Grace were the Gnostic Eons; and the Simonians, Dok t s, and other ē ē Gnostics held that the Eon Christ Jesus was never really, but only apparently clothed with a human body: but St. John replies that the Word did really become Flesh, and dwelt among us; and that in Him were the Pl roma and Truth and Grace. ē Page 401 of 621"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike In the doctrine of Valentinus, reared a Christian at Alexandria, God was a perfect Being, an Abyss [Βυθ ὸ ς . .

After having passed infinite ages in repose and silence, He man ifested Himself by His Thought, source of all His manif estations, and which received from Him the germ of His creations. Being of His Being, His Thought [ Ἕ ννοια . . Ennoia] is also termed Χάρις; [Charis], Grace or Joy, and Σιγ ή or Ἄ ρρητον [Sig or Arr ton], Silence or the Ineffable. Its first ē ē manifestation was Νους [Nous], the Intellig ence, first of the Eons, comm encement of all things, first revelation of the Divinit y, the Μονογεν ὴ ς [Monogen s], or Only-Begotten: ē next, Truth [ Ἀ λ ή θεια . .

The Marcosians taught that the Supreme Deity produced b y His words the Λ ό γος [Logos] or Plenitude of Eons: His first utterance was a syllable of four letters, each of which became a being; His second of four, Hi s third of ten, and Hi s fourth of twelve: thirty in all, which constituted the Πλ ή ρωμα [Pl roma]. ē The Valentinia ns, and others of the Gnostics, distinguished three orders of existences: – 1st. The divine germs of life, exalted by their nature above matter, and akin to the Σοφία [Sophia], to the mundane soul and to the Pl roma: – the spiritual natures, ē φ ύ σεις πνευματι καί [Phuseis Pneumat ikai]: 2d. The natures originating in the life, divided from the former by the mixture of the ὕ λη – the psy chical natures, φ ύ σεις ψυχικα ὶ [Phuseis Psuchikai]; with which begins a perfectl y new order of existence, an image of that higher mind and system, in a subordinate grade; and finall y, 3d. The Ungodlike or Hylic Nature, which resists all amelioration, and who se tendenc y is only to destro y – the nature of blind lust and pas sion. The nature of the πνευματι κ ὸ ν [pneumat ikon], the spiritual, is essential relationship with God (the ὁ μο ύ σιον τ ῷ θε ῷ . . Homoousion t The ): hence the life of Unity, the ō ō undivided, the absolutel y simple (ο ὐ σία ἑ νικ ὴ μονοειδ ὴ ς . . Ousia henike, monoeides). The essence of the ψυχικο ὶ [psuchikoi] is disruption into multiplicity, manifoldn ess; which, however, is subordinate to a higher unit y, by which it allows itself to be guided, first unconsciousl y, then consciousl y. Page 402 of 621"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The essence of the ὑ λικο ὶ [Hulikoi] (of whom Satan is the head), is the direct opposite to all unity; disruption and disunion in itself, without the least sympathy, without any point of coalescenc e whatever for unity ; together with an effort to destro y all unity, to extend its own inherent disunion to everything, and to rend every thing asunder. This principle has no power to posit anything; but onl y to negative: it is unable to create, to produce, to form, but only to destroy , to decompose. By Marcus, the disciple of Valentinus, the idea of a Λογος του οντος [Logos Tou Ontos], of a WORD, man ifesting the hidden Divine Essence, in the Creation, was spun out into the most subtle details – the entire creation being, in his view, a continuous utterance of the Ineffable. The way in which the germs of divine life [the σπέρματα πνευματι κ ὰ . . spermata pneum atika], which lie shut up in the Eons, continual ly unfold and individualiz e themselves more and more, is represented as a spontaneous anal ysis of the several names of the Ineffable, into their several sounds . An echo of the Pl roma falls down into the ē ὕ λη [ Hul ], and becomes the forming of a new but lower creation. ē One formul a of the pneumat ical baptism among the Gno stics ran thus: \"In the NA ME which is hidden from all the Divinities and Powers\" [of the Demiurg e], \"The Name of Truth\" [the Αλ ή θεια [Aletheia], self-manif estation of the Buthos], w hich Jesus of Nazareth has put on in the light- zones of Christ, the living Christ, through the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the angels, – the Name by which all things attain to Perfection.\" The candidate then said: \"I am established and redee med; I am redeemed in my soul from this world, and from all that belongs to it, by the name of יהוה , who has redee med the Soul of Jesus by the living Christ.\" The assembl y then said: \"Peace (or Salvation) to all on whom this name rests!\" The boy Dionuso s, torn in pieces, according to the Bacchic Mysteries, by the Titans, was considered by the Manicheans as simpl y representing the Soul, swallowed up by the powers of darkness, – the divine life rent into fragm ents by matter: – that part of the luminous essence of the primitive man [the πρ ῶ τος ἄ νθρωπος [ Protos Anthropos] of Mani, the πράων ἄ νθρωπος [ Pra n Anthr pos] of the Valentinians, the Adam Kadmon of the ō ō Kabalah; and the Kaiomorts of the Zendavesta], swallowed up by the powe rs of darkness; the Mundane Soul, mix ed with ma tter – the seed of divine life, which had fallen into matter, and had thence to undergo a process of purification and develop ment. The Γν ῶ σις [Gnosis] of Carpocrates and his s on Epiphanes consisted in the knowl edge of one Supreme Original being, the highest unity, from whom all existence has eman ated, and to whom it strives to return. The finite spirits that rule over the several portions of the Earth, seek to counteract this universal tendenc y to unity; and from their influence, their laws, and arrange ments, proceeds all that checks, disturbs, or li mits the original communion, which is the basis of nature, as the outward manif estation of that highest Unity. These spirits, mor eover, seek to retain under their dominion the souls which, emanating from the highest Unity, and still partaking of its nature, have lapsed into the corporeal world, and have there been imprisoned in bodies, in order, under their dominion, to be kept within the cycle of migra tion. From these finite spirits, the popular religions of different nations derive their origin. But the souls which, from a remin iscence of their former condition, soar upward to the contem plation of that higher Unity, reach to such Page 403 of 621"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike perfect freedom and repose, as nothing afterward can disturb or limit, and rise superior to the popular deities and religions. As examp les of this sort, they named Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and Christ. They made no distinction between the latter and the wise and good men of every nation. They taught that any other soul which could soar to the same height of conte mplation, might be regarded as equal with Him. The Ophites com menced their system with a Supreme Being, long unknown to the Human race, and still so the greater number of men ; the Βυθ ὸ ς [Buthos], or Profundit y, Source of Light, and of Adam-Kadmon, the Primitive Man, mad e by the Demiourgos, but perfected by the Supreme God by the communication to him of the Spirit [Πνε ῦ μα . . Pneuma]. The first emanation was the Thought of the Supreme Deity [the Ἕ ννοια . . Ennoia], the conception of the Universe in the Thought of God. This Thought, called also Silence (Σιγη . . Sige), produced the Spirit [Πνευμα . . Pneuma], Mother of the Living, and Wisdom of God. Together with this Primi tive Existence, Matter existed also (the Waters, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos), eternal like the Spiritual Principle. Buthos and His Thought, uniting with Wisdom, made her fruitful by the Divine Light, and she produced a perfect and an imperfect being, Christos , and a Second and inferior wisdom, Sophia- Achamoth , who falling into chaos rem ained entangled there, became enfeebled, and lost all knowledge of the Superior Wisdom that gave her birth. Communicating movement to Chaos, she produced Ialdabaoth, the Demiourgos, Agent of Material Creation, and then ascended toward her first place in the scale of creation. Ialdabaoth produced an angel that was his image, and this a second, and so on in succession to the sixth after the Dem iourgos: the seven being reflect ions one of the other, y et different and inhabiting seven distinct regions. The names of the six thus produced were IAO, SABAOTH, A DONAI, ELOI, ORAL, and ASTAPHAI. Ialdabaoth, to become independent of his mother, and to pass for the Supreme Being, m ade the world, and man, in his own image ; and his mo ther caused the Spiritual principle to pass from him into man so made ; and henceforward the contest between the Demiourgos and his moth er, between light and darkness, good and evil, was concentrat ed in man; and the image of Ialdabaoth, reflected upon matt er, became the Serpent- Spirit, Satan, the Evil Intelligenc e. Eve, created by Ialdabaoth, had by his Sons children that were angels like themse lves. The Spiritual light was withdrawn from man by Sophia, and the world surrendered to the influence of evil; until the Spirit, urged b y the entreaties of Wisdom, induced the Supreme Being to send Christos to redeem it. Compelled, despite himself, by his Mother, Ialdabaoth caused the man Jesus to be born of a Virgin, and the Celestial Saviour, uniting with his Sister, Wisdo m, descended through the regions of the seven angels, appeared in each under the form of its chief, concealed his own, and entered with his sister into the man Jesus at the baptis m in Jordan.

Tatian adopted the theor y of Emana tion, of Eons, of the existence of a God too sublime to allow Himself to be known, but displa ying Himself by Intelligen ces emanating from His bosom. The first of these was His spirit [Πνευμα . . Pneuma], God Himself, God thinking, God conceiving the Universe. The second wa s the Word [Λογος . . Logos], no longer merely the Thought or Conception, but the Creative Utterance, manifest ation of the Divinity, but emanating from the Thought or Spirit; the First-Begotten, author of the visible creation. This was the Trinit y, composed of the Father, Spirit, and Word. The Elxaïtes adopted the Seven Spirits of the Gnostics; but named them Heaven, Water, Spirit, The Holy Angels of Prayer, Oil, Salt, and the Earth. The opinion of the Doketes as to the human nature of Jesus Christ, was that most generall y received among the Gnostics. They deemed the intellig ences of the Superior World too pure and too much the antagonists of matter, to be willing to unite with it: and held that Christ, an Intelligenc e of the first rank, in appearing upon the earth, did not become confounded with ma tter, but took upon Himself only the appearance of a body, or at the most used it only as an envelope. Noëtus ter med the Son the first Utterance of the Father; the Word, not by Himself, as an Intelligence, and unconnected with the flesh, a real Son; but a Word, and a perfect Only- Begotten; light emanated from the Light; water flowing from its spring; a ray emanated from the Sun. Paul of Samosata taught that Jesus Christ wa s the Son of J oseph and Mary; but that the Word, Wisdom, or Intelligen ce of God, the Νους [Nous] of the Gnostics, had united itself with Him, so that He might be said to be at once the Son of God, and God Himself. Arius called the Saviour the first of creatures, non-em anated from God, but reall y created, by the direct will of God, before time and the ages. According to the Church, Christ was of the same nature as God; according to some dissenters, of the same nature as man. Arius adopted the theory of a nature analogous to both. When God resolved to create the Human race, He made a Being which He called THE WORD, THE SON, WIS DOM [Λ ό γος, Υ ἱὸ ς, Σοφία . . Logos, Uios, Sophia], to the end that He might give existence to men. This WORD is the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ensoph of the Kabalah, the Νο ῦ ς [Nous] of Platonis m and Philonism, and the Σοφια or Δεμιουργος [Sophia or Demiourgos] of the Gnostics. He distinguished the Inferior Wisdom, or the daughter, from the Superior Wisdom ; the latter being in God, inherent in His nature, and incapable of comm unication to any creature: the second, b y which the Son was made, communicated itself to Him, and therefore He Himself was entitled to be called the Word and the Son. Manes, founder of the Sect of the Manicheans, who had lived and been distinguished among the Persian Magi, profited by the doctrines of S cythianus, a Kabalist or Judaizing Gnostic of the ti mes of the Apostles; and knowing those of Bardesanes and Harmonius, derived his doctrines from Zoroasteris m, Christiani ty, and Gnosticism.

All souls are equal – God is in all, in men, animals, and plants. There are two Gods, one of Good and the other of Evil, each independent, eternal, chief of a distinct Empire; necessaril y, and of their ver y natures, hostile to one another. The Evil God, Satan, is the Genius of ma tter alone. The God of G ood is infinit ely his Superior, the True God; while the other is but the chief of all that is the Enemy of God, and must in the end succumb to His Power. The Emp ire of Light alone is eternal and true; and this E mpire is a great chain of Emanations, all connected with the Supreme Being which the y make manifest ; all HIM, under different forms, chosen for one end, the triumph of the Good. In each of His members lie hidden thousands of ineffable treasures. Excell ent in His Gl ory, incomprehensib le in His Greatness, the Father has joined to Himself those fortunate and glorious Eons [Αιωνες . . Aion s], whose Power and Number it is impossible to determine. ē This is Spinoza's Infinity of Infinite Attributes of God. Twelve Chief Eon s, at the head of all, were the Genii of the twelve Constellations of the Zodiac, and called by Manes, Olamin. Satan, also, Lord of the Empire of Darkness, had an Arm y of Eons or Demons, emanating from his Essence, and reflecting more or less his im age, but divided and inharmonious among themselv es. A war among them brought the m to the confines of the Realm of Light. Delighted, they sought to conquer it. But the Chief of the Celestial Empire created a Power which he placed on the frontiers of Heaven to protect his Eons, and destroy the Emp ire of Evil. This was the Mother of Life, the Soul of the World, an Emanation from the Supreme Being, too pure to come in immediate contact with m atter. It remained in the highest region; but produced a Son, the first Man [the Kaiomorts , Adam- Kadmon, Πρ ῶ τος Ανθρωπο ς [Protos Anthropos,] and Hivil- Zivah; of the Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, the Gnosis, and Sabeism] ; who comm enced the contest with the Powers of Evil, but, losing part of his panoply , of his Light, his Son and man y souls born of the Light, who were devoured by the darknes s, God sent to his assistance the living Spirit, or the Son of the First Man [Υ ἱὸ ς Ἀ νθρώπου . . Uios Anthropou], or Jesu s Christ. The Mother of Life, general Principle of Divine Life, and the first Ma n, Prim itive Being that reveals the Divine Life, are too sublime to be connected with the Empire of Darkness. The Son of Man or Soul of the World, enters into the Darkness, becomes its captive, to end by tempering and softening its savage nature. The Divine Spirit, after having brought back the Primi tive Man to the Emp ire of Light, raises above the world that part of the Celestial Soul that remained unaffected by being ming led with the Empire of Darkne ss. Placed in the region of the Sun and Moon, this pure soul, the Son of Man, the Redeemer or Christ, labors to deliver and attract to Himself that part of the Light or of the Soul of the First Man diffused through matter; which done, the world will cease to exist. To retain the rays of Light still remaining among his Eons, and ever tending to escape and return, b y concentra ting them, the Prince of Darkness, with their consent, made Adam, whose soul was of the Divine Light, contributed by the Eons, and his body of matt er, so that he belonged to both E mpires, that of Light and that of Darkness. To prevent the light from escaping at once, the Demons forbade Adam to eat the fruit of \"knowledge of good and evil,\" by which he would have known the Empire of Light and that of Darknes s.

This is repeated in the case of ever y man that lives. To deliver the soul, captive in darkness, the Principle of Light, or Genius of the Sun, charged to redee m the Intellec tual World, of which he is the t ype, came to man ifest Himself among men. Light appeared in the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not; according to the words of St. John. The Light could not unite with the darkness. It but put on the appearance of a human body, and took the name of Christ in the Messiah, only to accommodate itself to the language of the Jews. The Light did its work, turning the Jews from the adoration of the Evil Principle, and the Pagans from the worship of Demons. But the Chief of the Empire of Darkness caused Him to be crucified by the Jew s. Still He suffered in appearance only, and His death gave to all souls the s ymbol of their enfranchise ment. The person of Je sus having disappeared, there was seen in His place a cross of Light, over which a celestial voice pronounced these words: \"The cross of Light is called The Word, Christ, The Gate, Joy, The Bread, The Sun, The Resurrection, Jesus, The Father, The Spirit, Life, Truth, and Grace.\" With the Priscillianists there were two principles, one the Divinit y, the other, Primitive Matter and Darkness; each eternal. Satan is the son and lord of matter; and the secondar y angels and demons, children of matter. Satan created and governs the visible world. But the soul of man emanated from God, and is of the same substance with God. Seduced b y the evil spirits, it passes through various bodies, until, purified and reform ed, it rises to God and is strengthened by His light. These powers of evil hold mank ind in pledge; and to redeem this pledge, the Saviour, Christ the Redee mer, came and died upon the cross of expiation, thus discharging the written obligation. He, like all souls, was of the same substance with God, a manif estation of the Divinit y, not forming a second person; unborn, like the Divinit y, and nothing else than the Divinit y under another form. It is useless to trace these vagaries further; and we stop at the frontiers of the realm of the three hundred and sixty-five thousand emanations of the Mandates from the Primitive ī Light, Fira or Ferho and Yavar; and return contentedly to the simple and sublime creed of Masonry. Such were some of the ancient notions concerning the Deity; and taken in connection with what has been detailed in the pre-ceding Degrees, this Lecture affords you a true picture of the ancient speculations. From the beginning until now, those who have undertaken to solve the great mystery of the creation of a mater ial universe b y an Immaterial Deity, have interposed between the two, and between God and man, divers man ifestations of, or emanations from, or personified attributes or agents of, the Great Supreme God, who is coexistent with Ti me and coextensive with Space. The universal belief of the Orient was, that the Supreme Being did not Himself create either, the earth or man. The fragmen t which co mmences the Book of Genesis, consisting of the first chapter and the three first verses of the second, as signs the creation or rather the formation or modelling of the world from matter already existing in confusion, not to IHUH, but to the ALHIM, well known as Subordinate Deities, Forces, or Manifestations, among the Phœnicians. The second frag ment imputes it to IHUH-AL HIM, 1 and St. John Page 407 of 621"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike assigns the creation to the Λογος or WORD; and asserts that CHRIST was that WORD, as well as LIG HT and LIFE, other emanations from th e Great Primeva l Deity, to which other faiths had assigned the work of creation. An absolute existence, wholly immaterial, in no way within the reach of our senses; a cause, but not an effect, that never was not, but existed during an infinit y of eterniti es, before there was anything else except Time and Space, is wholly beyond the reach of our conceptions. The mind of man has wearied itself in speculations as to His nature, His essence, His attribut es; and ended in being no wiser than it began. In the impossibi lity of conceiving of imm ateriality, we feel at sea and lost whenever we go bey ond the doma in of matter. And yet we know that there are Powers, Forces, Causes, that are the mselves not matter. We give them names, but what they really are, and what their essence, we are wholly ignorant. But, fortunatel y, it does not follow that we may not believe , or even know , that which we cannot explain to ourselves, or that which is beyond the reach of our comprehension: If we believed only that which our intell ect can grasp, measure, comprehend, and have distinct and clear ideas of, we should believe scarce anything. The senses are not the witnesses that bear testimony to us of the loftiest truths. Our greatest difficult y is, that language is not adequate to express our ideas; because our words refer to things , and are images of what is substantial and mat erial. If we use the word \" emanation ,\" our mind involuntaril y recurs to someth ing material, flowing out of some other thing that is mater ial; and if we reject this idea of materiality, nothing is left of the emanation but an unrealit y. The word \"thing\" itself suggests to us that which is ma terial and within the cognizance and jurisdiction of the senses. If we cut away from it the idea of materiality, it presents itself to us as no thing, but an intangible unrealit y, which the mind vainly endeavors to grasp. Existence and Being are terms that have the same color of materiality; and when we speak of a Power or Force , the mind immediately images to itself one ph ysical and material thing acting upon another. Eliminate that idea; and the Power or Force, devoid of physical characteristi cs, seems as unreal as the shadow that dances on a wall, itself a mere absence of light; as spirit is to us merely that which is not matter . Infinite space and infinite time are the two prim ary ideas. We formul ize them thus: add body to body and sphere to sphere, until the imagination wearies; and still there will remain beyond, a void, emp ty, unoccupied SPACE, limitless, because it is void. Add event to event in continuous succession, forever and forever, and there will still remain, before and after, a TIME in which there was and will be no event, and also endless because it too is void. Thus these two ideas of the boundlessnes s of space and the endlessnes s of time seem to involve the ideas that matter and events are limited and finite. We cannot conceive of an infinit y of worlds or of events; but onl y of an indefinite number of each; for, as we struggle to conceive of their infinity , the thought ever occurs in despite of all our efforts – there must be space in which there are no worlds; there must have been time when there were no events.

Nor can we compr ehend how an infinite series of worlds, added together, is no larger than an infinite series of ato ms; or an infinit e series of centuries no longer than an infinite series of seconds; both being alike infinite, and therefore one series containing no more nor fewer units than the other. Nor have we the capacit y to form in ourselves any idea of that which is immaterial . We use the word, but it convey s to us only the idea of the absence and negation of materiality; which vanishing, Space and Tim e alone, infinite and boundless, seem to us to be left. We cannot form any conception of an effect without a cause. We cannot but believe, indeed we know, that, how far soever we may have to run back along the chain of effects and causes, it cannot be infinit e ; but we must come at last to something which is not an effect, bur the first cause: and yet the fact is litera lly beyond our comprehension. The mind refuses to grasp the idea of self -existence, of existence without a beginning. As well expect the hair that grows upon our head to understand the nature and immortality of the soul. It does not need to go so far in search of m ysteries; nor have we any right to disbelieve or doubt the existence of a Great First Cause, itself no effect, because we cannot compreh end it; because the words we u se do not even express it to us adequatel y. We rub a needle for a litt le while, on a dark, inert mass of iron ore, that had lain idle in the earth for man y centuries. Something is thereb y communicated to the steel – we term it a virtue , a power , or a quality – and then we balance it upon a pivot; and, lo! drawn b y some invisible, mysterious Power, one pole of the needle turns to the North, and there the same Power keeps the same pole for day s and years; will keep it there, perhaps, as long as the world lasts, carry the needle where you will, and no mat ter what seas or moun tains intervene between it and the North Pole of the world. And this Po wer, thus acting, and indicating to the mariner his course over the trackless ocean, when the stars shine not for many days, saves ves sels from shipwreck, families from distress, and those from sudden death on who se lives the fate of nations and the peace of the world depend. But for it, Napoleon might never have reached the ports of France on his return from Egypt, nor Nelson lived to fight and win at Trafalgar. Men call this Power Magnetism , and then complacently think that they have explained it all; and yet they have but given a new name to an unknown thing, to hide their ignorance. What is this wonderful Power? It is a real, actual, active Power: that we know and see. But what its essence is, or ho w it acts, we do not know, any more than we kno w the essence or the mode of action of the Creative Thought and Word of God. And again, what is that which we ter m galvanism and electric ity , – which, evolved by the action of a little acid on two m etals, aided b y a magnet, circles the earth in a second, sending from land to land the Thoughts that govern the transactions of individuals and nations?

What is that heat which plays so wonderful a part in the world's econo my? – that caloric , latent everywhere, within us and without us, produced by combustion, by intense pressure, and by swift motion? Is it substance, matter, spirit, or imm aterial, a mere Force or State of Matter? And what is light ? A substance , say the books, – matter , that travels to us from the sun and stars, each ray separable into seven, b y the prism, of distinct colors, and with distinct peculiar qualities and actions. And if a substance, what is its essence, and what power is inherent in it, by which it journey s incalculabl e myriads of miles, and reaches us ten thousand years or more after it leaves the stars? All power is equall y a mystery. Apply intense cold to a drop of w ater in the centre of a globe of iron, and the globe is shattered as the water freezes. Confine a little of the same limpid element in a cylinder which Enceladus or Typhon could not have riven asunder, and apply to it intense heat, and the vast power that couched latent in the water shivers the cylinder to atoms. A little shoot from a minute seed, a shoot so soft and tender that the least bruise would kill it, forces its way downward into the hard earth, to the depth of man y feet, with an energy wholly incomprehensib le. What are these m ighty forces, locked up in the small seed and the drop of water? Nay, what is LIFE itself, with all its wondrous, might y energies, – that power which maintains the heat within us, and prevents our bodies, that deca y so soon without it, from resolution into their original elements – Life, that constant miracle, the nature and essence whereof have eluded all the philosophers; and all their learned dissertations on it are a mere jargon of w ords? No wonder the ancient Persians thought that Light and Life were one; both emanations from the Supreme Deity, the archetype of light. No wonder that in their ignorance they worshipped the Sun. G od breathed into man the spirit of life; not ma tter, but an e manation from Himself; not a creature made by Him, nor a distinct existence, but a Power , like His own Thought: and light, to those great- souled ancients, also seemed no creature, and no gross mater ial substance, but a pure eman ation from the Deity, immortal and indestructib le like Himself. What, indeed, is REALITY? O ur dreams are as real, while they last, as the occurrences of the daytime. We see, hear, feel, act, experience pleasure and suffer pain, as vividl y and actually in a dream as when awake.

And vet the attribut es do not exist without the substance. They are not substances, but adjectives. There is no such thing or existence as hardness, w eight or color, by itself, detached from any subject, mov ing first here, then there, and attach ing itself to this and to the other subject. And y et, they say, the attributes are not the sub ject. So Thought, Volition, and Perception are not the soul, but its attributes ; and we have no cognizance of the soul itself , but onl y of them , its man ifestations. Nor of G od; but only of His Wisdom, Power, Magnificence, Truth, and other attribut es. And ye t we know that there is matter, a soul within our bod y, a God that lives in the Universe. Take, then, the attribut es of the soul. I am conscious that I exist and am the same identical person that I was twenty years ago. I am conscious that my body is not I, – that if my arms were lopped away, this person that I call ME, would still remain, comple te, entire, identical as before. But I cannot ascertain, by the most intense and long- continued reflection, what I am, nor where within my body I reside, nor whether I am a point, or an expanded substance. I have no power to exa mine and inspect. I exist, will, think, perceive. That I know, and nothing more. I think a noble and sublim e Thought. What is that Thought? It is not Matter, nor Spirit. It is not a Thing; but a Power and Force . I make upon a paper certain conventiona l marks, that represent that Thought. There is no P ower or Virtue in the marks I write, but onl y in the Thought which the y tell to others. I die, but the Thought still lives. It is a Power. It acts on men, excites them to enthusiasm, inspires patriotis m, governs their conduct, controls their destinies, dispose s of life and death. The words I s peak are but a certain succession of particul ar sounds, that by conventiona l arrange ment communicate to others the Im material, Intangible, Eternal Thought. The fact that Thought continues to exist an instant, after it makes its appearance in the soul, proves it immortal: for there is nothing conceivable that can destroy it. The spoken words, being mere sounds, may vanish into thin air, and the written ones, mere marks, be burned, erased, destroyed: but the THOUGHT itself lives still, and must live on forever. A Human Thought, then, is an actual EXISTENCE, and a FO RCE and POWER, capable of acting upon and controlling matter as well as mind. Is not the existence of a God, w ho is the immaterial soul of the Universe, and whose THOU GHT, embod ied or not embodied in His WORD, is an Infinite Power, of Creation and production, destruction and preservation, quite as compreh ensible as the existence of a Soul, of a Thought separated from the Soul, of the Power of that Thought to mou ld the fate and influence the Destinies of Humani ty? And ye t we know not when that Thought comes, nor what it is. It is not WE. We do not mould it, shape it, fashion it. It is neither our mechan ism nor our invention. It appears spontaneousl y, flashing, as it were, into the soul, mak ing that soul the involuntar y instrum ent of its utterance to the world. It comes to us, and seems a stranger to us, seeking a home.

Volition, like Thought, seems spontaneous, an effect without a cause. Circu mstances provoke it, and serve as its occasion , but do not produce it.

Is it the manifest ation of the soul, mer ely making apparent what passes within the soul, or an eman ation from it, going abroad and acting outwardl y, itself a real Existence, as it is an admitted Power? We can but own our ignorance. It is certain that it acts on other souls, controls, directs the m, shapes their action, legislat es for men and nations: and yet it is not mat erial nor visible; and the laws it writes merely inform one soul of what has passed within another. God, therefore, is a mystery, only as ever ything that surrounds u s, and as we ourselves, are mysteries. We know that there is and must be a FIRST CA USE. His attributes, severed from Himself, are unrealities. As color and extension, weight and hardness, do not exist apart from matter as separate existences and sub stantives, spiritual or immaterial; so the Goodness, Wisdom, Justice, Mercy, and Benevolence of God are not independent existences, personif y them as men may, but attributes of the Deit y, the adjectives of One Great Substantive. But we know that He must be Good, True, Wise, Just, Benevolent, Merciful: and in all these, and all His other attributes, Perfect and Infinite ; because we are conscious that these are laws imposed on us by the ver y nature of things, necessary , and without which the Universe would be con-fusion and the existence of a God incredible. They are of His essence , and necessar y, as His existence is. He is the Living, Thinking, Intelligent Sour, of the Universe, the PERM ANENT, the STATION ARY [Εστως . .

This is the real idea of the Ancient Nations: GOD, the Almigh ty Father, and Source of All; His THO UGHT, conceiving the whole Universe, and willing its creation: His WORD, uttering that THOU GHT, and thus beco ming the Creator or Demiourgos, in whom was Life and Light, and that Light the Life of the Universe. Nor did that Word cease at the single act of Creation; and having set going the great machine, and enacted the laws of its mot ion and progression, of birth and life, and change and death, cease to exist, or rema in thereafter in inert idleness.

THIS is the first of the really Chivalric Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. It occupies this place in the Calendar of the Degrees between the 26th and the last of the Philosophical Degrees, in order, b y breaking the continuit y of these, to relieve what might otherwise become wearisome; and also to remind you that, while engaged with the speculations and abstractions of philosophy and creeds, the Mason is also to continue engaged in the active duties of this great warfare of life. He is not only a Moralist and Philosopher, but a Soldier, the Successor of those Knights of the Middle Age, who, while they wore the Cross, also wielded the Sword, and were the Soldiers of Honor, Loy alty, and Duty. Times change, and circu mstances; but Virtue and Duty remain the same. The Evils to be warred against but take another shape, and are developed in a different form. There is the same need now of truth and loyalty as in the days of Frederic Barbarossa. The characters, religious and mi litary, attention to the sick and wounded in the Hospital, and war against the Infidel in the field, are no longer blended; but the same duties, to be perform ed in another shape, continue to exist and to environ us all. The innocent virgin is no longer at the mercy of the brutal Baron or licentious man-at- arms; but purit y and innocence still need protectors. War is no longer the apparentl y natural State of Societ y; and for most men it is an empt y obligation to assume, that they will not recede before the enemy; but the same high duty and obligation still rest upon all men. Truth, in act, profession, and opinion, is rarer now than in the days of chivalr y. Falsehood has beco me a current coin, and circulat es with a certain degree of respectabilit y; because it has an actual value. It is indeed the great Vice of the Age – it, and its twin-sister, Dishonesty . Men, for politica l preferment, profess whatever principles are expedient and profitable. At the bar, in the pulpit, and in the halls of legislat ion, men argue against their own convictions, and, with what they term logic , prove to the satisfaction of others that which they do not the mselves believe, Insincerit y and duplicit y are valuable to their possessors, like estates in stocks, that yield a certain revenue: and it is no longer the truth of an opinion or a principle, but the net profit that may be realized from it, which is the measure of its value. The Press is the great sower of falsehood. To slander a political antagonist, to misrepresent all that he says, and, if that be impossible, to invent for him what he does not say; to put in circulation whatever baseless calu mnies against hi m are necessary to defeat him, – these are habits so com mon as to have ceased to excite notice or com ment, much less surprise or disgust.

The Knight Comm ander of the Temple revives the old Knightly spirit; and devotes himself to the old Knightl y worship of Truth. No profession of an opinion not his own, for expedienc y's sake or profit, Or through fear of the world's disfavor; no slander of even an enemy; no coloring or perversion of the sa yings or acts of other m en; no insincere speech and argument for any purpose, or under an y pretext, must soil his fair escutcheon. Out of the Chapter, as well as in it, he must speak the Truth, and all the Truth, no more and no less; or else speak not at all. To purity and innocence everywhere, the Knight Com mander owes protection, as of old; against bold violence, or those, more guilty than murder ers, who by art and treacher y seek to slay the soul; and against that want and destitution that drive too many to sell their honor and innocence for food. In no age of, the world has man had better opportunit y than now to display those lofty virtues and that noble heroism that so distinguished the three great military and religious Orders, in their youth, before they became corrupt and vitiated by prosperity and power. When a fearful epidem ic ravages a cit y, and death is inhaled with the air men breathe; when the living scarcel y suffice to bury the dead, – most men flee in abject terror, to return and live, respectabl e and influenti al, when the danger has passed awa y. But the old Knightl y spirit of devotion and disinterestedness and conte mpt of death still lives, and is not extinct in the human heart. Ever ywhere a few are found to stand fir mly and unflinchingl y at their posts, to front and defy the danger, not for mone y, or to be honored for it, or to protect their own household; but from mere human ity, and to obey the unerring dictates of duty . They nurse the sick, breathing the pestilenti al atmosphere of the hospital. They explore the abodes of want and miser y. With the gentleness of woman, they soften the pains of the dying, and feed the lamp of life in the convalescent. They perform the last sad offices to the dead; and they seek no other reward than the approval of their own consciences. These are the true Knights of the present age: these, and the captain who remains at his post on board his shattered ship until the last boat, loaded to the water's edge with passengers and crew, has parted from her side; and then goes cal mly down with her into the mysterious depths of the ocean: – the pilot who stands at the wheel while the swift flames eddy round hi m and scorch awa y his life: – the fire man who ascends the blazing walls, and plunges amid the flames to save the propert y or lives of those who have upon him no claim by tie of blood, or friendship, or even of ordinary acquaint ance: – these, and others like these: – all men, who, set at the post of duty , stand there manfully; to die, if need be, but not to desert their post: for these, too, are sworn not to recede before the enemy. To the perform ance of duties and of acts of heroism like these, you have devoted yourself, my Brother, b y becoming a Knight Comm ander of the Temple. Soldier of the Truth and of Loyalty!

GOD is the author of ever ything that existeth; the Eternal, the Supreme, the Living, and Awful Being; from Whom nothing in the Universe is hidden. Make of Him no idols and visible images; but rather worship Him in the deep solitudes of sequestered forests; for He is invisible, and fills the Universe as its soul, and liveth not in any Temple! Light and Darkness are the World's Eternal ways. God is the principle of every thing that exists, and the Father of all Beings. He is eternal, immovable, and Self-Existent. There are no bounds to His power. At one glance He sees the Past, the Present, and the Future; and the procession of the builders of the Pyramids, with us and our remo test Descendants, is now passing before Him. He reads our thoughts before they are known to ourselves. He rules the move ments of the Universe, and all events and revolutions are the creatures of His will. For He is the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligen ce.

Man was created pure; and God gave him TRUTH, as He gave him LIGHT. He has lost the truth and found error . He has wandered far into darkness; and round him Sin and Page 418 of 621"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Shame hover evermor e. The Soul that is impure, and sinful, and defiled with earthl y stains, cannot again unite with God, until, by long trials and man y purifications, it is finall y delivered from the old calam ity; and Light overcomes Darkness and dethrones it, in the Soul. God is the First; indestructibl e, eternal, UNCREATED, IN DIVISIBLE. Wisdom , Justice , Truth , and Mercy , with Harmony and Love , are of His essence, and Eternity and Infinitude of Extension . He is silent, and consents with MIN D, and is known to Souls through MIND alone. In Him were all things originall y contained, and from Him all things were evolved. For out of His Divine SILENCE and REST, after an infinitude of time, was unfolded the WORD, or the Divine POWER; and then in turn the Might y, ever-acting, measureless INTELLECT ; and from the WORD were evolved the myriads of suns and sy stems that make the Universe; and fire , and light , and the electri c HARMONY, which is the harmon y of spheres and numbers: and from the INTELLECT all Souls and intellec ts of men. In the Beginning, the Universe was but ONE SO UL.

Thus, threefold, fruit of God' s thought, is Man; that sees and hears and feels; that thinks and reasons; that loves and is in harmon y with the Universe. Before the world grew old, the prim itive Truth faded out from men's Souls. Then man asked hi mself, \" What am I? and how and whence am I? and whither do I go? \" And the Soul, looking inward upon itself, strove to learn whether that \"I\" were mer e matter; its thought and reason and its passions and affections mere results of mat erial combin ation; or a material Being enveloping an immaterial Spirit: . . and further it strove, b y self- examination, to learn whether that Spirit were an individual essence, with a separate immortal existence, or an infinitesim al portion of a Great First Principle, inter-penetrating the Universe and the infinitude of space, and undulating like light and heat: . . and so they wandered further am id the mazes of error; and i magined vain philosophies; wallowing in the sloughs of mater ialism and sensualism, of beating their wings vainly in the vacuu m of abstractions and idealiti es. While yet the first oaks still put forth their leaves, man lost the perfect knowledge of the One True God, the Ancient Absolute Existence, the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence; and floated helplessl y out upon the shoreless ocean of conjecture. Then the soul vexed itself with seeking to learn whether the material Universe was a mere chance Page 419 of 621"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike combination of atoms, or the work of Infinite, Uncreated Wisdom : . . whether the Deit y was a concentrat ed, and the Universe an extended immateriality; or whether He was a personal existence, an Omnipo tent, Eternal, Supreme Essence, regulating matter at will; or subjecting it to unchangeabl e laws throughout eternity; and to Whom, Himself Infinite and Eternal, Space and Time are unknown. With their finite limited vision the y sought to learn the source and explain the existence of Evil, and Pain, and Sorrow; and so they wandered ever deeper into the darkness, and were lost; and there was for the m no longer any God; but only a great, dumb, soulless Universe, full of mere emblems and symbols. You have heretofore, in some of the Degrees through which y ou have passed, heard much of the ancient worship of the Sun, the Moon, and the other bright luminar ies of Heaven, and of the Ele ments and Po wers of Universal Nature. You have been made, to some extent, familiar with their personificat ions as Heroes s uffering or triumph ant, or as personal Gods or Goddesse s, with human character istics and pas sions, and with the multitude of legends and fables that do but allegori cally represent their risings and settings, their courses, their conjunctions and oppositions, their domiciles and places of exalta tion. Perhaps y ou have supposed that we, like many who have written on these sub jects, have intended to represent this wor ship to you as the most ancient and original worship of the first men that lived. To undeceive you, if such was yo ur conclusion, we have caused the Personifications of the Great Luminar y of Heaven, under the names by which he was known to the most ancient nations, to proclaim the old primi tive truths that were known to the Fathers of our race, before men came to worship the visible manifesta tions of the Supreme Power and Magnificence and the Supposed Attributes of the Universal Deity in the Elements and in the glittering armies that Night regularl y marshals and arra ys upon the blue field of the fir mament. We ask now your attention to a still further develop ment of these truths, after we shall have added something to what we have already said in regard to the Chief Lu minary of Heaven, in explanation of the names and characteristi cs of the several imaginary Deities that represented him among the ancient races of men. ATHOM or ATHO M-RE, was the Chief and Oldest Supreme God of Upper Egypt, worshipped at Thebes; the same as the OM or AUM of the Hind s, whose name was ū unpronounceable, and who, like the BREHM of the latter People, was \"The Being that was, and is, and is to come; the Great God, the Great Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresen t One, the Greatest in the Universe, the Lord;\" whose emb lem was a perfect sphere, showing that He was first, last, m idst, and without end; superior to all Nature- Gods, and all personifications of Powers, Elem ents, and Lum inaries; symbolized by Light, the Principle of Life. AMUN was the Nature- God, or Spirit of Nature, called by that name or AMUN-RE, and worshipped at Memphis in Lower Egypt, and in Libya, as well as in Upper Eg ypt. He was the Libyan Jupiter, and represented the intell igent and organizing force that develops itself in Nature, when the intellec tual types or forms of bodies are revealed to the senses in the world's order, by their union with ma tter, whereby the generation of bodies is effected. He was the same with Kneph, from whose mouth issued the Orphic egg out of which ca me the Universe. Page 420 of 621"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike DIONUSOS was the Nature- God of the Greeks, as A MUN was of the Egyptians. In the popular legend, Dionusos, as well as Hercules, was a Theban Hero, born of a mortal mother. Both were sons of Zeus, both persecuted by Here. But in Hercules the God is subordinate to the Hero; while Dionuso s, even in poetr y, retains his divine character, and is identical with Iacchus, the presiding genius of the M ysteries. Personification of the Sun in Taurus, as his ox-hoofs sho wed, the delivered earth from the harsh dom inion of Winter, conducted the mighty chorus of the Stars, and the celestia l revolution of the y ear, changed with the seasons, and underwent their periodica l decay. He was the Sun as invoked b y the Eleans , Πυριγενης, ushered into the world amidst lightning and thunder, the Mighty Hunter of the Zodiac, Zagreus the Golden or rudd y-faced. The Mysteries taught the doctrine of Divine Unity; and that Power Whose Oneness is a seem ing mystery, but reall y a truism, was Dionuso s, the God of Nature, or of that moisture, which is the life of Nature, who prepares in darkness, in Hades or Iasion, the return of life and vegetation, or is hi mself the light and change evolving their varieties. In the Egean Islands he was Butes, Dardanus, Himeros or Imbros; in Crete he appears as Iasius or even Zeus, whose orgiastic worship, remaining unveiled by the usual forms of mystery, betrayed to profane curiosit y the symbols which, if irreverentl y contemp lated, were sure to be misunderstood. He was the same with the dismem bered Zagreus, the son of Persephoné, an Ancient Subterranean Dionusos, the horned progeny of Zeus in the Constellation of the Serpent, entrusted by his father with the thunderbolt, and encircl ed with the protecting dance of Curetes. Through the envious artifices of Here, the Titans eluded the vigilanc e of his guardians and tore him to pieces; but Pallas restored the still palpitating heart to his father, who com manded Apollo to bury the dismem bered remains upon Parnas sus. Dionusos, as w ell as Apollo, was leader of the Muses; the tomb of one accomp anied the worship of the other; the y were the same, yet different, contrasted, yet only as filling separate parts in the same drama; and the mystic and heroic personifications, the God of Nature and of Art, seem, at some remote period, to have proceeded from a common source. Their separation was one of form rather than of substance: and from the time when Hercules obtained initiation from Triptol emus, or Pythagoras received Orphic tenets, the two conceptions were tending to re-combin e. It was said that Dionusos or P oseidon had preceded Apollo in the Oracular office; and Dionusos continued to be esteem ed in Greek Theolog y as Healer and Saviour, Author of Life and Immortality. The dispersed Pythagoreans, \"Sons of Apollo,\" immediately betook themse lves to the Orphic Service of Dionusos, and there are indicat ions that there was alwa ys someth ing Dionysiac in the worship of Apollo. Dionusos is the Sun, that liberator of the elements; and his spiritual meditation was suggested b y the same imager y which made the Zodiac the suppo sed path of the Spirits in their descent and their return. His second birth, as offspring of the highest, is a type of the spiritual regeneration of man. He, as well as Apollo, was preceptor of the Muses and source of inspiration. His rule prescribed no unnatural mortification: its yoke was easy , and its mirthful choruses, combin ing the gay with the severe, did but comm emorate that golden age when earth enjoyed eternal spring, and when fountains of honey , milk, and wine burst forth out of its bosom at the touch of the thyrsus. He is the \"Liberator.\" Like Osiris, he frees the soul, and guides it in its migra tions beyond the grave, preserving it from the risk Page 421 of 621"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike of again falling under the slaver y of matt er or of some inferior animal form. All soul is part of the Universal Soul, whose totalit y is Dionuso s; and he leads back the vagrant spirit to its home, and acco mpanies it through the purif ying processes, both real and symbolical, of its earthly transit. He died and descended to the Shades; and his suffering was the great secret of the Mysteries, as death is the grand mystery of existence. He is the immortal suitor of Psyche (the Soul), the Divine influence which physically called the world into being, and which, awakening the soul from its Stygian trance, restores it from earth to Heaven. Of HERMES, the Mercur y of the Greeks, the Thoth of the Egyptians, and the Taaut of the Phœnicians, we have heretofore spoken sufficientl y at length. He was the inventor of letters and of Oratory, the winged messenger of the Gods, bearing the Caduceus wreathed with serpents; and in our Council he is represented by the ORATOR. The H i n d ū s called the Sun SU RYA; the Persians , MITHRAS; the Egyptians , OSIRIS; the Assyrians and Chaldæans , BEL; the Scythians and Etruscans and the ancient Pelasgi , ARKALEUS or HERCULES; the Phœnicians , ADONAI or A DON; and the Scandinavians , ODIN. From the name SURYA, given by the Hind s to the Sun, the Sect who paid him ū particul ar adoration were called Souras . Their painters describe his car as drawn by seven green horses. In the Te mple of Visweswara, at Benares, there is an ancient piece of sculpture, well executed in stone, representing him sitting in a car drawn by a horse with twelve heads. His charioteer, by whom he is preceded, is ARUN [from אור , AUR the Crepusculum ?], or the Dawn; and among his man y titles are twelve that denote his distinct powers in each of the twelve mon ths. Those powers are called Adityas, each of whom has a particular name. Surya is suppo sed frequentl y to have descended upon earth, in a human shape, and to have left a race on earth, equally renowned in Indian story with the Heliades of Greece. He is often st yled King of the Stars and Planets, and thus reminds us of the Adon-Tsbauth (Lord of the Starr y Hosts) of the Hebrew w ritings. MITHRA S was the Sun-God of the Persians; and was fabled to have been born in a grotto or cave, at the Winter Solstice. His feasts were celebrat ed at that period, at the mo ment when the sun commenced to return Northward, and to increase the length of the days. This was the great Feast of the Magian religion. The Rom an Calendar, published in the time of Constantine, at which period his wor ship began to gain ground in the Occident, fixed his feast-day on the 25th of December. His statues and i mages were inscribed, Deo-Soli invicto Mithræ – to the invincibl e Sun-God Mithras. Nomen invictum Sol Mithra... Soli Omnipotenti Mithræ . To him, gold, incense, and myrrh were consecrated. \"Thee,\" says Martianus Capella, in his hymn to the Sun, \"the dwellers on the Nile adore as Serapis, and Memphis worships as O siris; in the sacred rites of Persia thou art Mithras, in Phr ygia, Atys, and Lib ya bows down to thee as Ammon, and Ph œnician Byblos as Adonis; and thus the whole world adores thee under different names.\" OSIRIS was the son of Helios (Phra), the \"divine offspring con-generate with the dawn,\" and at the same time an incarnation of Kneph or Agathodæmon, the Good Spirit, including all his possible m anifesta tions, either physical or mora l. He represented in a familiar form the beneficent aspect of all higher emanations and in him was developed the conception of Page 422 of 621"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike a Being purel y good, s o that it became necessar y to set up another power as his adversary , called Seth, Bab ys or Typhon, to account for the injurious influences of Nature. With the phenomena of agriculture, supposed to be the invention of Osiris, the Egyptians connected the highest truths of their religion. The soul of man was as the seed hidden in the ground, and the mort al framework, similarly consigned to its dark resting-place, awaited its restoration to life's unfailing source. Osiris was not only benefactor of the living; he was also Hades, Serapis, and Rhadaman thus, the monarch of the dead. Death, therefore, in Egyptian opinion, was only another name for renovation, since its God is the same power who incessantl y renews vitalit y in Nature. Every corpse dul y embalmed was called \"Osiris,\" and in the grave was supposed to be united, or at least brought into approxi mation, to the Divinit y. For when God beca me incarnate for man's benefit, it was implied that, in analog y with His assumed character, He should submit to all the conditions of visible existence. In death, as in life, Isis and Osiris were patterns and precursors of mankind; their sepulchres stood within the temples of the Superior Gods; ye t though their remains might be ento mbed at Memphis or Abydus, their divinity was unimpeach ed, and they either shone as lumin aries in the heavens, or in the unseen world presided over the futurity of the disembodi ed spirits whom death had brought nearer to them. The notion of a dy ing God, so frequent in Oriental legend, and of which we have already said much in form er Degrees, was the natural inference from a litera l interpreta tion of nature-worship; since nature, which in the vicissitudes of the seasons s eems to undergo a dissolution, was to the earliest religionists the express image of the Deit y, and at a remot e period one and the same with the \"varied God,\" who se attribu tes were seen not only in its vitality, but in its changes. The unseen Mover of the Universe was rashly identified with its obvious fluctuat ions. The speculativ e Deity suggested by the dram a of nature, was worshipped with imitative and sympathetic rites. A period of mourning about the Autumna l Equinox, and of joy at the return of Spring, was almost universal. Phrygians and Paphlagonians, Bœotians, and even Athenians, were all more or less attached to such observances; the Syrian damsels sat weeping for Tha mmuz or Adoni, mortally wounded b y the tooth of Winter, symbolized by the boar, its very general emblem: and these rites, and those of Atys and Osiris, were evidentl y suggested by the arrest of vegetation, when the Sun, descending from his altitude, seems deprived of his generating power. Osiris is a being analogous to the Syrian ADONI; and the fable of his histor y, which we need not here repeat, is a narrative form of the popular religion of Egypt, of which the Sun is the Hero, and the agricultural calendar the moral. The moist valley of the Nile, owing its fertility to the annual inundation, appeared, in contrast with the surrounding desert, like life in the midst of death. The inundation was in evident dependence on the Sun, and Eg ypt, environed with arid deserts, like a heart within a burning censer, was the female power, dependent on the influences personified in its God. Typhon his brother, the type of darkness, drought, and sterility, threw his body into the Nile; and thus O siris, the \"good,\" the \"Saviour,\" perished, in the 28th ye ar of his life or reign, and on the 17th da y of the month Athor, or the 13th of November. He is also made to die during the heats of the earl y Summer, when, from March to July, the earth was parched with intolerable heat, vegetation was scorched, and the languid Nile exhausted. From that death he rises when the Solstitial Sun brings the inundation, and Eg ypt is filled with mirth and acclam ation Page 423 of 621"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike anticipatory of the second harvest. From his Wintr y death he rises with the early flowers of Spring, and then the joyful festival of Osiris found was celebrated. So the pride of Jemsheed, one of the Persian Sun-heroes, or the solar y ear personified, was abruptly cut off by Zohak, the tyrant of the West. He was sawn asunder b y a fish-bone, and immediately the brightness of Iran changed to gloom. Ganymede and Adonis, like Osiris, were hurried off in all their strength and beaut y; the prematur e death of Linus, the burthen of the ancient lament of Greece, was like that of the Persian Siamek, the Bith ynian Hylas, and the Egyptian Maneros, Son of Menes or the Eternal. The eleg y called Maneros w as sung at Egyptian banquets, and an effigy enclosed within a diminutive Sarcophagus was handed round to rem ind the guests of their brief tenure of existence. The beautiful Memnon, also, perished in his prime; and Enoch, whose earl y death was lamen ted at Iconium, lived 365 years, the number of days of the solar y ear; a brief space when compared with the longevit y of his patriarchal kindred. The story of Osiris is reflected in those of O rpheus and Dionusos Zagreus, and perhaps in the legends of Absy rtus and Pelias, of Æson, Thyestes, Melicert es, Itys, and Pelops. Io is the disconsolate Isis or Niobe: and Rhea mourns her disme mbered Lord, Hy perion, and the death of her son Helios, drowned in the Eridanus; and if Apollo and Dionusos are immortal, they had died under other na mes, as Orpheu s, Linus, or Hyacinthus. The sepulchre of Zeus was sho wn in Crete. Hippol ytus was associated in divine honors with Apollo, and after he had been torn to pieces like Osiris, wa s restored to life by the Pæonian herbs of Diana, and kept darkling in the secret grove of Egeria. Zeus deserted Olympus to visit the Ethiopians; Apollo underwent servitude to Admetus; Theseus, Peirithous, Hercules, and other heroes, descended for a time to Hades; a dying Nature-God was exhibited in the Mysteries, the Attic women fasted, sitting on the ground, during the Thesmophor ia, and the Bœotians lamented the descent of Cora-Pro serpine to the Shades. But the death of the Deity, as understood b y the Orientals, was not inconsistent with His immortality. The temporary decline of the Sons of Light is but an episode in their endless continuit y; and as the day and year are mor e convenient subdivisions of the Infinite, so the fiery deaths of Phaëthon or Hercules are but breaks in the same Phœnix process of perpetual regeneration, by which the spirit of Osiris lives forever in the succession of the Memphi an Apis. Every year witnesses the revival of Adonis; and the amb er tears shed by the Heliades for the prem ature death of their brother, are the golden shower full of prolific hope, in which Zeus descends from the brazen vault of Heaven into the bosom of the parched ground. BAL, representativ e or personification of the sun, was one of the Great Gods of Syria, Assyria, and Chaldea, and his na me is found upon the monum ents of Nimroud, and frequentl y occurs in the Hebrew writings. He was the Great Nature- God of Bab ylonia, the Power of heat, life, and generation. His symbol was the Sun, and he was figured seated on a bull. All the accessories of his great temple at Babylon, described by Herodotus, are repeated with singular fidelity, but on a smaller scale, in the Hebrew tabernac le and temple. The golden statue alone is wanted to co mplete the resemblan ce. The word Bal or Baal , like the word Adon , signifies Lord and Master. He was also the Supreme Deity of the Moabites, Amonites, and Carthaginians, and of the Sabeans in general; the Gauls Page 424 of 621"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike worshipped the Sun under the nam e of Belin or Belinus: and Bela is found among the Celtic Deities upon the ancient monum ents. The Northern ancestors of the Greeks main tained with hardier habits a more manly style of religious symbolism than the effeminate enthusiasts of the South, and had embodied in their Perseus , HERCULES and MITHRAS, the consum mation of the qualiti es they esteemed and exercised. Almost every nation will be found to have had a m ythical being, whose strength or weakness, virtues or defects, more or less nearl y describe the Sun's career through the seasons. There was a Celtic, a Teutonic, a Scythian, an Etruscan, a Lydian Hercules, all whose legends beca me tributar y to those of the Greek hero. The name of Hercules was found b y Herodotus to have been long fami liar in Egypt and the East, and to have originall y belonged to a much higher personage than the compar atively modern hero known in Greece as the Son of Alcm ena. The temple of the Hercules of T yre was reported to have been built 2300 ye ars before the time of Herodotus; and Hercules, who se Greek name has been sometimes supposed to be of Ph œnician origin, in the sense of Circuitor, i.e. \"rover\" and \"pera mbulator\" of earth, as well as \"Hy perion\" of the sky , was the patron and model of those famous navigators who spread his altars from coast to coast through the Mediterranean, to the extrem ities of the West, where \"AR KALEUS\" built the City of Gades, and where a perpetual fire burned in his service. He was the lineal descendant of Perseus, the lu minous child of darkness, conceived within a subterranean vault of brass; and he a representation of the Persian Mithras, rearing his emble matic lions above the gates of Mycenæ, and bringing the sword of Jemsheed to battle against the Gorgons of the West. Mithras is simi larly described in the Zend- Avesta as the \"might y hero, the rapid runner, whose piercing eye embrac es all, whose arm bears the club for the destruction of the Darood.\" Hercules Ingeniculus, who, bending on one knee, uplifts his club and tramp les on the Serpent's head, was, like Prometh eus and Tantalus, one of the varying aspects of the struggling and declining Sun. The victories of Hercules are but exhibit ions of Solar power which have ever to be repeated. It was in the far North, among the Hyperbore ans, that, divested of his Lion's skin, he la y down to sleep, and for a tim e lost the horses of his chariot. Henceforth that Northern region of gloom, called the \"place of the death and revival of Adonis,\" that Caucasus who se summit was so loft y, that, like the Indian Meru, it seemed to be both the goal and com mencement of the Sun's career, became to Greek imaginations the final bourne of all things, the abode of Winter and desolation, the pinnacle of the arch connecting the upper and lower world, and consequentl y the appropriate place for the banishm ent .of Prometheus. The daughters of Israel, weeping for Thammuz, mentioned by Ezekie l, sat looking to the North, and waiting for his return from that region. It was w hile Cybele with the Sun-God was absent among the Hyperbore ans, that Phrygia, abandoned b y her, suffered the horrors of famin e. Delos and Delphi awaited the return of Apollo from the Hyperbore ans, and Hercules brought thence to Olympia the olive. To all Masons, the North has im memorially been the place of darkness; and of the great lights of the Lodge, none is in the North.

The Persian beacon on the mountain- top represented the Rock-born Divinit y enshrined in his worthiest t emple; and the funeral conflagration of Hercules was the sun dy ing in glory behind the Western hills. But though the transitor y manifestation suffers or dies, the abiding and eternal power liberates and saves. It was an essential attribut e of a Titan, that he should arise again after his fall; for the revival of Nature is as certain as its decline, and its alternations are subject to the appoint ment of a power which controls the m both. \"God,\" say s Maximus Tyrius, \"did not spare His own Son [Hercules], or exe mpt Him from the calamities incidenta l to humanit y. The Theban progen y of Jove had his share of pain and trial. By vanquishing earthl y difficulties he proved his affinit y with Heaven. His life was a continuous struggle. He fainted before Typhon in the desert; and in the commencement of the Autumn al season (cum longæ redit hora noctis), descended under the guidance of Minerva to Hades. He died; but first applied for initia tion to Eumolpus, in order to foreshadow that state of religious preparation which should precede the momentous change. Even in Hades he rescued Theseus and removed the stone of Ascalaphus, reani mated the bloodless spirits, and dragged into the light of day the monster Cerberus, ju stly reputed invincible because an emblem of Time itself; he burst the chains of the grave (for Busiris is the grave personified), and triumphan t at the close as in the dawn of his career, was received after his labors into the repose of the heavenl y mansions, living forever with Zeus in the arms of Eternal Youth. ODIN is said to have borne twelve na mes among the old Germans, and to have had 114 names besides. He wa s the Apollo of the Scandinavians, and is represented in the Voluspa as destined to slay the monstrous snake. Then the Sun will be extinguished, the earth be dissolved in the ocean, the stars lose their brightness, and all Nature be destroy ed in order that it may be renewed again. From the bosom of the waters a new world will em erge clad in verdure; harvests will be seen to ripen where no seed was s own, and evil will disappear. The free fanc y of the ancients, which wove the web of their myths and legends, was consecrated by faith. It had not, like the modern mind, set apart a petty sanctuar y of borrowed beliefs, beyond which all the rest was comm on and unclean. Imagination, reason, and religion circled round the same symbol; and in all their symbols there was serious meaning, if we could but find it out. The y did not devise fictions in the same vapid spirit in which we, cramped by conventionalit ies, read them. In endeavoring to interpret creations of fancy, fancy as well as reason must guide: and much of modern controversy arises out of heav y misapprehensions off ancient symbolism. To those ancient peoples, this earth was the centre of the Universe. To them there were no other worlds, peopled with living beings, to divide the care and attention of the Deit y. To them the world was a great plain, of unknown, perhaps inconceivab le limits, and the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars journey ed above it, to give the m light. The worship of the Sun became the basis of all the religions of antiquit y. To them light and heat were mysteries; as indeed they still are to us. As the Sun caused the day, and his absence the night; as, when he journeyed Northward, Spring and Summer followed him; and when he again turned to the South, Autumn and inclem ent Winter, and cold and long dark nights ruled the earth;...

To them he was the innate fire of bodies, the fire of nature. Author of Life, heat, and ignition, he was to them the efficien t cause of all generation, for without him there was no move ment, no existence, no form. He was to the m immense, indivisibl e, imperishabl e, and ever ywhere present. It was their need of light, and of his creative energy , that was felt by all men; and nothing was more fearful to them than his absence. His beneficent inf luences caused his identification with the Principle of Good; and the BRAHMA of the Hind s, the MITHRAS of the Persians, and ATHOM, AMUN, PHTHA, ū and OSIRIS, of the Egyptians, the BEL of the Chald ans, the ADONAI of the Ph æ œnicians, the ADONIS and APOLLO of the Greeks beca me but personifications of the Sun, the regenerating Principle, image of that fecundit y which perpetuates and rejuvenates the world's existence. So too the struggle between the Good and Evil Principles was personified, as was that between life and death, destruction and re- creation; in allegories and fables which poetically represented the apparent course of the Sun; who, de scending toward the Southern Hemisphere, was figurativel y said to be conquered and put to death by darkness, or the genius of Evil; but, returning again toward the Northern Hemisphere, he seemed to be victorious, and to arise from the tomb. This death and resurrection were also figurative of the succession of day and night, of death, which is a necessit y of life, and of life which is born of death; and everywhere the ancients still saw the comb at between the two Principles that ruled the world. Ever ywhere this contest was embodied in allegori es and fictitious histories: into which were ingeniousl y woven all the astronom ical phenomen a that accompanied, preceded, or followed the different movements of the Sun, and the changes of Season s, the approach or withdrawal of inundation. And thus grew into stature and strange proportions the histories of the contests between T yphon and Osiris, Hercules and Juno, the Titans and Jupiter, Ormuzd and Ahriman, the rebellious Angels and the Deity, the Evil Genii and the Good; and the other like fables, found not onl y in Asia, but in the North of Europe, and even among the Mexicans and Peruvians of the New World; carried thither, in all probabilit y, by those Phœnician voyagers who bore thither civilization and the arts. The Scythians lamented the death of Acmon, the Persians that of Zohak conquered by Pheridoun, the Hindus that of Soura-Parama slain by Soupra-Muni, as the Scandinavians did that of Balder, torn to pieces b y the blind Hother. The primitive idea of infinite space existed in the first men, as it exists in us. It and the idea of infinite time are the first two innate ideas. Man cannot conceive how thing can be added to thing, or event follow event, forever. The idea will ever return, that no mat ter how long bulk is added to bulk, there must be, still beyond, an empty void without limit; in which is nothing . In the same way the idea of time without beginning or end forces itself on him. Time , without events, is also a void , and nothing . In that empty void space the primitive men knew there was no light nor warmth. They felt , what we know scientific ally, that there must be a thick darkness there, and an intensit y of cold of which we have no conception. Into that void they thought the Sun, the Planets, and the Stars went down w hen they set under the Western Horizon. Darkness wa s to them an enemy, a harm, a vague dread and terror. It was the very embodi ment of the evil principle; Page 427 of 621"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and out of it they said that he was formed. As the Sun bent Southward toward that void, they shuddered with dread: and when, at the Winter Solstice, he again commenced his Northward mar ch, they rejoiced and feasted; as they did at the Sum mer Solstice, when most he appeared to smil e upon the m in his pride of place. These days have been celebrat ed by all civilized nations ever since. The Christian has mad e them feast-da ys of the church, and appropriated them to the two Saints John; and Masonr y has done the same. We, to whom the vast Universe has becom e but a great machine , not instinct with a great SOUL, but a clockwork of proportions unimagin able, but still infinitel y less than infinit e; and part at least of which we with our orreries can im itate; we, who have measured the distances and dim ensions, and learned the specific gravity and deter mined the orbits of the moon and the planets; we, who know the distance to the sun, and his size; have measured the orbits of the flashing com ets, and the distances of the fixed stars; and know the latter to be suns like our sun, each with his retinue of worlds, and all governed b y the same unerring, mechan ical laws and outwardl y imposed forces, centripetal and centrifugal ; we, who with our telescopes have separated the galax y and the nebula into other stars and groups of stars; discovered new planets, by first discovering their disturbing forces upon those already known; and learned that they all, Jupiter, Venus, and the fier y Mars, and Saturn and the others, as well as the bright, m ild, and ever-changing Moon, are mere dark, dull, opaque clods like our earth, and not living orbs of brilliant fire and heavenl y light; we, who have counted the mounta ins and chasms in the moon, with glasses that could distinctl y reveal to us the temple of Solomon, if it stood there in its old original glory; we, who no longer imagin e that the stars control our destinies, and who can calculate the eclipses of the sun and moon, backward and forward, for ten thousand y ears; we, with our vastly increased conceptions of the powers of the Grand Architect of the Universe, but our wholly material and mech anical view of that Universe itself; we cannot, even in the remotest degree, feel , though we may partiall y and imp erfectly imagine , how those great, primitive, simple-hearted children of Nature felt in regard to the Starry Hosts, there upon the slopes of the Hima layas, on the Chaldæan plains, in the Persian and Median deserts, and upon the banks of that great, strange River, the Nile. To them the Universe was alive – instinct with forces and powers, m ysterious and beyond their comprehension. To them it was no mach ine, no great system of clockwork; but a great live creature, an arm y of creatures, in sympathy with or inimi cal to man. To them, all was a mystery and a miracle, and the stars flashing overhead spoke to their hearts almost in an audible language. Jupiter, with his kingly splendors, was the E mperor of the starry legions. Venus looked lovingl y on the earth and blessed it; Mars, with his crimson fires, threatened war and misfortune; and Saturn, cold and grave, chilled and repelled them. The ever-changing Moon, faithful companion of the Sun, wa s a constant m iracle and wander; the Sun himse lf the visible emblem of the creativ e and generative power. To the m the earth was a great plain, over which the sun, the moon, and the planets revolved, its servants, framed to give it light. Of the stars, s ome were beneficent existences that brought with the m Spring-ti me and fruits and flowers, – some, faithful sentinels, advising the m of com ing inundation, of the season of storm and of deadl y winds; some heralds of evil, which, steadily foretelling, they seemed to cause. To them the eclipses were portents of evil, and their causes hidden in mystery, and supernatural. The regular returns of the stars, the comings of Arcturus, Orion, Sirius, the Pleiades, and Aldebarán, and the journeyings of the Sun, w ere voluntar y and not mechanical to them. What wonder that astrono my became to them the most importan t of Page 428 of 621"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike sciences; that those who learned it became rulers; and that vast edifices, the Pyramids, the tower or templ e of Bel, and other like erections everywhere in the East, were builded for astronom ical purposes ? – and what wonder that, in their great child-like simplicity, they worshipped Light, the Sun, the Planets, and the Stars, and personified them, and eagerl y believed in the histories invented for the m; in that age when the capacit y for belief was infinite; as indeed, if we but reflect, it still is and ever will be? If we adhered to the literally historic sense, antiquit y would be a mere inexplicabl e, hideous chaos, and all the Sages deranged: and so it would be with Masonry and those who instituted it. But when these allegori es are explained, they cease to be absurd fables, or facts purely local; and becom e lessons of wi sdom for entire humani ty. No one can doubt, who studies the m, that they all came from a common source. And he greatl y errs who imag ines that, because the mythological legends and fables of antiquit y are referable to and have their foundation in the phenomena of the Heavens, and all the Heathen Gods are but mere names given to the Sun, the Stars, the Planets, the Zodiaca l Signs, the Ele ments, the Powers of Nature, and Universal Nature herself, therefore the first men worshipped the Stars, and whatever things, animate and inanim ate, seemed to them to possess and exercise a power or influence, evident or imagin ed, over human, fortunes and human destiny. For ever, in all the nations, ascending to the remotest antiquit y to which the light of History or the glimmerings of tradit ion reach, we find, seated above all the gods which represent the luminar ies and the elements, and those which personif y the innate Powers of universal nature, a still higher Deity, silent, undefined, incomprehensibl e, the Supreme, one God, from Whom all the rest flow or emana te, or by Him are created. Above the Time- God Horu s, the Moon-G oddess or Earth- Goddess Isis, and the Sun-God O siris, of the Egyptians, was Amun, the Nature- God; and above him, again, the Infinite, Incompr ehensible Deity, ATHOM. BREH M, the silent, self-contem plative , one original God, was the Source, to the Hind s, of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. Above Zeus, or before ū him, were Kronos and Ouranos. Over the Alohayim was the great Nature-God AL, and still beyond him, Abstract Existence, IHUH – He that IS, WA S, and SHALL BE. Above all the Persian Deities was the Unlimited Time, ZERUANE-AK HERENE; and over Odin and Thor was the Great Scandinavian Deity ALFADIR. The worship of Universal Nature as a God was too near akin to the worship of a Universal Soul, to have been the instinctiv e creed of any savage people or rude race of men. To imagine all nature, with all its apparentl y independent parts, as forming one consistent whole, and as itself a unit, required an amount of experience and a faculty of generaliza tion not possessed by the rude uncivilized mind, and is but a step below the idea of a universal Soul. In the beginning man had the WORD; and that WORD wa s from God; and out of the living POWER com municated to man in and b y that WORD, came THE LIGHT of His Existence. God made man in His own likeness. When, b y a long succession of geological changes, He had prepared the earth to be his habitat ion, He created him, and placed him in that part of Page 429 of 621"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Asia which all the old nations agreed in calling the cradle of the human race, and whence afterward the stream of hum an life flowed forth to India, China, Egypt, Persia, Arabia, and Phœnicia. HE comm unicated to him a knowledge of the nature of his Creator, and of the pure, primitive, undefiled religion. The peculiar and distinctive excellenc e and real essence of the primitive man, and his true nature and destin y, consisted in his likeness to God. HE stamped His own image upon man's soul. That image has been, in the breast of ever y individual man and of mankind in general, greatly altered, impaired, and defaced; but its old, half-oblitera ted characters are still to be found on all the pages of prim itive history; and the impr ess, not entirely effaced, every reflecting mind may discover in its own interior. Of the original revelation to mankind, of the pri mitive WORD of Divine TRUTH, we find clear indicat ions and scattered traces in the sacred traditions of all the prim itive Nations; traces which, when separatel y examined, appear like the broken re mnants, the mysterious and hierogly phic characters, of a mighty edifice that has been destro yed; and its fragments, like those of the old Temples and Palaces of Nimroud, wrought incongruously into edifices many centuries younger. And, although amid the ever- growing degenerac y of mankind, this primeva l word of revelation was falsified by the admixture of various errors, and overlaid and obscured by numberl ess and manifold fictions, inextricabl y confused, and disfigured almost beyond the power of recognition, still a profound inquir y will discover in heathenis m many luminous vestiges of pri mitive Truth. For the old Heathenism had ever ywhere a foundation in Truth; and if we could separate that pure intuit ion into nature and into the simpl e symbols of nature, that constituted the basis of all Heathenis m, from the allo y of error and the additions of fiction, those first hieroglyphic traits of the instinctiv e science of the first men, would be found to agree with truth and a true knowledge of nature, and to afford an i mage of a free, pure, comprehensive, and finished philosoph y of life. The struggle, thenceforward to be eternal, between the Divine will and the natural will in the souls of men, commenced immediately after the creation. Cain slew his brother Abel, and went forth to people parts of the earth with an impious race, forgetters and defiers of the true God. The other Descendants of the Com mon Father of the race intermarried with the daughters of Cain's Descendants: and all nations preserved the remem brance of that division of the human family into the righteous and i mpious, in their distorted legends of the wars between the Gods, and the Giants and Titans. When, afterward, another sim ilar division occurred, the Descendants of Seth alone preserved the true pri mitive religion and science, and transmit ted them to posterity in the ancient symbolical character, on monuments of stone: and man y nations preserved in their legendar y traditions the memory of the columns of Enoch and Seth. Then the world declined from its original happy condition and fortunate estate, into idolatry and barbarism: but all nations retained the memory of that old estate; and the poets, in those earl y days the onl y historians, com memorated the succession of the ages of gold, silver, brass, and iron. In the lapse of those ages, the sacred tradition followed various courses among each of the most ancient nations; and from its original source, as from a comm on centre, its various Page 430 of 621"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike streams flowed down ward; some diffusing through favored regions of the world fertili ty and life; but others soon losing the mselves, and being dried up in the sterile sands of human error. After the internal and Divine WORD originall y communicated by God to man, had become obscured; after man's connection with his Creator had been broken, even outward language necessaril y fell into disorder and confusion. The simpl e and Divine Truth was overlaid with various and sensual fictions, buried under illusive symbols, and at last perverted into horrible phantoms. For in the progress of idolatr y it needs came to pass, that what was originall y revered as the symbol of a higher principle, became graduall y confounded or identified with the object itself, and was wor shipped; until this error led to a more degraded form of idolatr y. The early nations received much from the primeva l source of sacred tradition; but that haughty pride which seems an inherent part of human nature led each to represent these fragmentary relics of original truth as a possession peculiar to themselv es; thus exaggerating their value, and their own importan ce, as peculiar favorites of the Deity, who had chosen them as the favored people to whom to com mit these truths. To make these fragments, as far as possible, their private property , they reproduced the m under peculiar forms, wrapped the m up in symbols, concealed them in allegories, and invented fables to account for their own special possession of the m. So that, instead of preserving in their primitive simplicity and purit y these blessings of original revelation, they overlaid them with poetical ornament; and the whole wears a fabulous aspect, until by close and severe examination we discover the truth which the apparent fable contains. These being the conflicting elements in the breast of man; the old inheritan ce or original dowry of truth, imparted to him by God in the primitive revelation; and error, or the foundation for error, in his degraded sense and spirit now turned from God to nature, false faiths easily sprung up and grew rank and luxuriant, when the Divine Truth was no longer guarded with jealous care, nor preserved in its pristine purity. This soon happened among most Eastern nations, and especiall y the Indians, the Chaldæans, the Arabians, the Persians, and the Egyptians; with whom imagin ation, and a ver y deep but still sensual feeling for nature, were ver y predominan t. The Northern firmament, visible to their eyes, possesses by far the largest and most brillian t constella tions; and they were more alive to the impressions made by such ob jects, than are the men of the present day. With the Chinese, a patriarchal, simple, and secluded people, idolatry long made but little progress. They invented writing within three or four generations after the flood; and the y long preserved the memory of much of the primitive revelation; less overlaid with fiction than those fragmen ts which other nations have remembered. They were among those who stood nearest to the source of sacred tradition; and many passages in their old writings contain remarkabl e vestiges of eternal truth, and of the WORD of prim itive revelation, the heritage of old thought, which attest to us their original eminence. But among the other earl y nations, a wild enthusias m and a sensual idolatry of nature soon superseded the simple worship of the Almigh ty God, and set aside or disfigured the pure belief in the Eternal Uncreated Spirit. The great powers and elem ents of nature, and the vital principle of production and procreation through all generations; then the celesti al Page 431 of 621"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike spirits or heavenl y Host, the luminous armies of the Stars, and the great Sun, and mysterious, ever-changing Moon (all of which the whole ancient world regarded not as mere globes of light or bodies of fire, but as animated living substances, potent over m an's fate and destinies); next the genii and tutelar spirits, and even the souls of the dead, received divine worship. The animals, representing the starry constellations, first reverenced as symbols merely, came to be worshipped as gods; the heavens, earth, and the operations of nature were personified; and fictitious personages invented to account for the introduction of science and arts, and the fragm ents of the old religious truths; and the good and bad principles personified, became also objects of worship; while, through all, still shone the silver threads .of the old primitive revelation. Increasing familiarity with earl y oriental records seems more and more to confir m the probabilit y that they all originall y emanated from one source. The eastern and southern slopes of the Paropismus, or Hinduku sch, appear to have been inhabited by kindred Iranian races, similar in habits, language, and religion. The earliest Indian and Persian Deities are for the most part symbols of celestial light, their agency being regarded as an eternal warfare with the powers of Winter, storm, and darkness. The religion of both was originall y a worship of outward nature, especiall y the man ifestations of fire and light; the coincidenc es being too marked to be mer ely acciden tal. Deva, G od, is derived from the root div , to shine. Indra, like Ormuzd or Ahura-Mazda, is the bright firmament; Sura or Surya, the Heavenl y, a name of the Sun, recurs in the Zend word Huare, the Sun, whence Khur and Khorshid or Corasch. Uschas and Mitra are Medic as well as Zend Deities and the Amschaspands or \"imm ortal Holy Ones\" of the Zend-Avesta m ay be comp ared with the seven Rishis or Vedic Star-God, of the constellat ion of the Bear. Zoroastrianis m, like Buddhism, was an innovation in regard to an older religion; and between the Parsee and Brahmin may be found traces of disruption as well as of coincidence. The original Nature- worship, in which were combined the conceptions both of a Universal Presence and perpetuit y of action, took different directions of developm ent, according to the difference between the Indian and Persian mind. The early shepherds of the Pun jaub, then called the country of the Seven Rivers, to who se intuition al or inspired wisdom (Veda) we owe what are perhaps the most ancient religious effusions extant in any language, apostrophized as living beings the physical objects of their worship. First in this order of Deities stands Indra, the God of the \"blue\" or \"glittering\" firmament, called Devaspiti, Father of the Devas or Ele mental Powers, who measured out the circle of the sky, and made fast the foundations of the Earth; the ideal domain of Varouna, \"the All-enco mpasser,\" is almost equally extensive, including air, water, night, the expanse between Heaven and Earth; Agni, who lives on the fire of the sacrifice, on the domest ic hearth, and in the lightnings of the sky, is the great Mediator between God and Man; Uschas, or the Dawn, leads forth the Gods in the morning to make their daily repast in the intoxicating Soma of Nature's offertory , of which the Priest could only compound from simples a symbolical imitation. Then came the various Sun-Gods, Adityas or Solar Attributes, Surya the Heavenl y, Savitri the Progenitor, Pashan the Nourisher, Bagha the Felicitous, and Mitra the Friend. The coming forth of the Eternal Being to the work of creation was represented as a marriage, his first eman ation being a universal mo ther, supposed to have potentiall y Page 432 of 621"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike existed with hi m from Eternity, or, in me taphorical language, to have been \"his sister and his spouse.\" She becam e eventuall y promoted to be the Mother of the Indian Trinit y, of the Deity under His three Attributes, of Creation, Preservation, and Change or Regeneration. The most popular forms or manifest ations of Vishnu the Pre-server, were his successive avataras or historic impersonations, which represented the Deit y coming forth out of the incomprehensib le mystery of His nature, and revealing Himself at those critic al epochs which either in the physical or mor al world seem ed to mark a new com mencement of prosperit y and order. Comba ting the power of Evil in the various depart ments of Nature, and in successive periods of ti me, the Divinit y, though varying in form, is ever in reality the same, whether seen in useful agricultural or social inventions, in traditional victories over rival creeds, or in ph ysical changes faintl y discovered through tradition, or suggested by cosmogoni cal theory. As Rama, the Epic hero arm ed with sword, club, and arrows, the prototype of Hercules and Mithras, he wrestles like the Hebrew Patriarch with the Powers of Darkness; as Chrishna-Govinda, the Divine Shepherd, he is the Messenger of Peace, overmastering the world b y music and love. Under the human form he never ceases to be the Supreme Being. \"The foolish\" (he sa ys, in Bhagavad Ghita), \"unacquaint ed with m y Supreme Nature, despise me in this human form, while men of great minds, enlightened by the Divine principle within them, acknowledge me as incorruptible and before all things, and serve me with undivided hearts.\" \"I am not recognized by all,\" he says again, \"because concealed by the supernatural power which is in me; yet to me are known all things past, present, and to com e; I existed before Vaivaswata and Menou. I am the Most High G od, the Creator of the World, the Eternal Pooroo scha (Man-World or Genius of the World). And although in my own nature I am exempt from liability to birth or death, and am Lord of all created things, ye t as often as in the world virtue is enfeebled, and vice and injustice prevail, so often do I become manifest and am revealed from age to age, to save the just, to destroy the guilt y, and to reassure the faltering steps of virtue. He who acknowledgeth me as even so, doth not on quitting this mortal frame enter into another, for he entereth into me; and many who have trusted in me have alread y entered into me, being purified by the power of wisdom. I help those who walk in m y path, even as they serve me.\" Brahma, the creating agent, sacrificed himself, when, b y descending into material forms, he became incorporated with his work; and his m ythological history was interwoven with that of the Universe. Thus, although spirituall y allied to the Supreme, and Lord of all creatures (Prajapati), he shared the imperfe ction and corruption of an inferior nature, and, steeped in man ifold and perishable forms, might be said, like the Greek Uranus, to be mutilated and fallen. He thus combined two characters, formless form, immortal and mortal, being and non-being, motion and rest. As Incarnate Intelligen ce, or THE WORD, he communicated to man what had been revealed to himself by the Eternal, since he is creation's Soul as well as Body, within which the Divine Word is w ritten in those living letters which it is the prerogative of the self-conscious spirit to interpret. The fundamen tal principles of the religion of the Hindi's consisted in the belief in the existence of One Being onl y, of the immortality of the soul, and of a future state of rewards and punishments. Their precepts of moral ity inculca te the practice of virtue as necessar y for procuring happiness even in this transient life; and their religious doctrines make their felicity in a future state to depend upon it. Page 433 of 621"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Besides their doctrine of the transm igration of souls, their dogmas may be epitom ized under the following heads: 1st. The existence of one God, from Whom all things proceed, and to Whom all must return.

A triparti te division of the Good Principle, for the purposes of Creation, Preservation, and Renovation by change and death. 3d. The necessary existence of an Evil Principle, occupied in counteract ing the benevolent purposes of the first, in their execution by the Devata or Subordinate Genii, to whom is entrusted the control over the various operations of nature.

But the m ind of finite beings is impressed by one uninterrupted series of illusions, which the y consider as real, until again united to the great fountain of truth. Of these illusions, the first and most essential is individualit y. By its influence, when detached from its source, the soul becomes ignorant of its own nature, origin, and destiny . It considers itself as a separate existence, and no longer a spark of the Divinit y, a link of one i mmeasurab le chain, an infinitely small but indispensable portion of one great whole.\" Their love of imager y caused the m to personify what the y conceived to be some of the attributes Of God, perhaps in order to present things in a way better adapted to the comprehensions of the vulgar, than the abstruse idea of an indescribable, invisible God; and hence the invention of a Brahm a, a Vishnu, and a Siva or Is wara. These were represented under various forms; but no e mblem or visible sign of Brihm or Brehm, the Omnipot ent, is to be found. The y considered the great mystery of the existence of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, as be yond human compreh ension. Every creature endowed with the facult y of thinking, they held, must be conscious of the existence of a God, a first cause; but the attempt to explain the nature of that Being, or in any way to assimil ate it with our own, the y considered not only a proof of folly , but of extreme impiety. The following extracts from their books will serve to show what were the real tenets of their creed: 'By one Supreme Ruler is this Universe pervaded; even ever y world in the whole circle of nature. . There is one Supreme Spirit, which nothing can shake, more swift than the thought of man.

They speak of the Supreme Being as an eternal essence that pervades space, and gives life or existence. Of that universal and eternal pervading spirit, the Vedanti suppose four Page 435 of 621"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike modifications; but as these do not change its nature, and as it would be erroneous to ascribe to each of the m a distinct essence, so it is equall y erroneous, they say, to imagin e that the various modific ations by which the All- pervading Being exists, or displa ys His power, are individual existences. Creation is not considered as the instant production of things, but only as the man ifestation of that which exists eternall y in the one Universal Being. The Nyaya philosophers believe that spirit and mat ter are eternal; but the y do not suppo se that the world in its present form has existed from eternity, but onl y the prim ary matter from which it sprang when operated on by the almigh ty Word of God, the Intelligent Cause and Supreme Being, Who produced the combina tions or aggregations which compose the material Universe. Though they believe that soul is an eman ation from the Supreme Being, they distinguish it from that Being, in its individual existence. Truth and Intelligence are the eternal attribut es of God, not, they say, of the individual soul, which is susceptible Both of knowledge and ignorance, of pleasure and pain; and therefore God and it are distinct. Even when it returns to the Eternal, and attains supreme bliss, it undoubtedl y does not cease. Though united to the Supreme Being, it is not absorbed in it, but still retains the abstract nature of definite or visible existence. \"The dissolution of the world,\" the y say, \"consists in the destruction of the visible forms and qualities of things; but their material essence rem ains, and from it new worlds are formed by the creativ e energy of God; and thus the Universe is dissolved and renewed in endless succession.\" The Jainas, a sect at Mysore and elsewhere, say that the ancient religion of India and of the whole world consisted in the belief in one God, a pure Spirit, indivisible, omnisc ient and all-powerful; that God, having given to all things their appointed order and course of action, and to man a sufficient portion of reason, or understanding, to guide him in his conduct, leaves him to the operation of free will, without the entire exercise of which he could not be held answerable for his conduct. Menou, the Hind lawgiver, adored, not the visible, material Sun, but \"that divine and ū incomparably greater light,\" to use the words of the most venerable text in the Indian S cripture, \"which illumines all, delights all, from which all proceed, to which all must return, and which alone can irradiate our intel lects.\" He thus co mmences his Institutes: \"Be it heard! \"This Universe existed only in the first divine idea yet unexpanded, as if involved in darkness, imp erceptible, undefinable, undiscoverable by reason, and undiscovered by revelation, as if it were wholly immersed in sleep: \"Then the Sole Self-existing Power, Himself undiscovered, but mak ing this world discernible, with five elements, and other principles of nature, appeared with undim inished glory, expanding His idea , or dispelling the gloom. \"He Whom the mind alone can perceive, whose essence eludes the eternal organs, who has no visible parts, who exists from Eternit y, even He, the soul of all beings, Who m no being can comprehend, shone forth.

Then HE had this thought, I will create worlds ; and thus HE created these different worlds; air, the light, mortal beings, and the waters. \"HE had this thought: Behold the worlds; I will create guardians for the worlds . So HE took of the water and fashioned a being clothed with the human form. He looked upon him, and of that being so conte mplated, the mouth opened like an egg, and speech came forth, and from the speech fire.

And separating the suture of the cranium, He penetrated into man.\" Behold the great fundam ental primitive truths! God, an infinite Eternal Soul or Spirit. Matter, not eternal nor self-existent, but created – created by a thought of God. After matter, and worlds, then man, by a like thought: and finall y, after endowing him with the senses and a thinking mind, a portion, a spark, of God Himself penetrates the man, and becomes a living spirit within him. The Vedas thus detail the creation of the world: \"In the beginning there was a single God, existing of Himself; Who, after having passed an eternity absorbed in the contem plation of His own being, desired to manif est His perfections outwardl y of Himself; and created the matter of the world. The four elem ents being thus produced, but still mingled in confusion, He breathed upon the waters, which swelled up into an immense ball in the shape of an. egg, and, developing themselv es, became the vault and orb of Heaven which encircles the earth. Having made the earth and the bodies of ani mal beings, this God, the essence of movem ent, gave to them, to animate them, a portion of His o wn being. Thus, the soul of every thing that breathes being a fraction of the universal soul, none perishes; but each soul merely changes its mould and form, by passing successivel y into different bodies.

Their conquests brought them in contact with China; and they subdued Egypt and Judea. Their views of God and religion more resembled tho se of the Hebrew s than those of an y other nation; and indeed the latter people borrowed from them some prominent doctrines, that we are in the habit of regarding as an essential part of the original Hebrew creed. Of the King of H eaven and Father of Eternal Light, of the pure World of LIG HT, of the Eternal WORD by which all things were created, of the Seven Might y Spirits that stand next to the Throne of Light and Omnipotenc e, and of the glory of those Heavenl y Hosts that encompass that Throne, of the Origin of Evil, and the Prince of Darkness, Monarch of the rebellious spirits, ene mies of all good, the y entertained tenets very similar to those of the Hebrew s. Toward Egyptian idolatry they felt the strongest abhorrence, and under Cambyses pursued a regular plan for its utter extirpat ion. Xerxes, when he invaded Greece, destroyed the Temples and erected fire-chapels along the whole course of his march. Their religion was eminently spiritual, and the earthly fire and earthl y sacrifice were but the signs and emb lems of another devotion and a higher power. Thus the fundamen tal doctrine of the ancient religion of India and Persia was at first nothing more than a simp le veneration of nature, its pure ele ments and its prim ary energies, the sacred fire, and above all, Light, the air, not the lower atmospheri c air, but the purer and brighter air of Heaven, the breath that animates and pervades the breath of mortal life. This pure and simple veneration of nature is perhaps the most ancient, and was by far the most generall y prevalent in the primitive and patriarcha l world. It was not originall y a deification of nature, or a denial of the sovereignt y of God. Those pure ele ments and primitive essences of created nature offered to the first men, still in a close communication with the Deit y, not a likeness of resemblan ce, nor a mere fanciful image or a poetical figure, but a natural and true s ymbol of Divine power. Ever ywhere in the Hebrew w ritings the pure light or sacred fire is emp loyed as an image of the all- pervading and all- consuming power and omnipresen ce of the Divinit y. His breath was the first source of life; and the faint whisper of the breeze announced to the prophet His immediate presence. \"All things are the progen y of one fire. The Father perfected all things, and delivered them over to the Second Mind, w hom all nations of men call the First. Natural works co-exist with the intell ectual light of the Father; for it is the Soul which adorns the great Heaven, and which adorns it after the Father. The Soul, being a bright fire, by the power of the Father, remains immortal, and is mistress of life, and fills up the recesses of the world. For the fire which is first be yond, did not shut up his power in ma tter by works, but b y mind, for the framer of the fier y world is the m ind of mind, who first sprang from mind, clothing fire with fire. Father-begotten Light! for He alone, having from the Father's po wer received the essence of intell ect, is enabled to understand the mind of the Father; and to instill into all sources and principles the capacit y of understanding, and of ever continuing in ceaseless revolving motion.\" Such wa s the language of Zoroaster, embod ying the old Persian ideas.

He fixed a great multitude of moveless stars, that stand still forever, not by compulsion and unwillingl y, but without desire to wander, fire acting upon fire. He congregated the seven firmaments of the world, and so surrounded the earth with the convexit y of the Heavens; and therein set seven living existences, arranging their apparent disorder in regular orbits, six of them planets, and the Sun, placed in the centre, the seventh; – in that centre from which all lines, diverging which way soever, are equal; and the swift sun himself, revolving around a principal centre, and ever striving to reach the central and all- pervading light, bearing with him the bright Moon.\" And ye t Zoroaster added: \"Measure not the journey ings of the Sun, nor atte mpt to reduce them to rule; for he is carried by the eternal will of the Father, not for yo ur sake. Do not endeavor to understand the impetuous course of the Moon; for she runs evermore under the impulse of necessit y; and the progression of the Stars wa s not generated to serve an y purpose of y ours.\" Ormuzd says to Zoroaster, in the Boundehesch: \"I am he who holds the Star-Spangled Heaven in ethereal space; who makes this sphere, which once was buried in darkness, a flood of light. Through me the Earth became a world firm and lasting – the earth on which walks the Lord of the world. I am he who mak es the light of Sun, Moon, and Stars pierce the clouds. I make the corn seed, which perishing in the ground s prouts anew... I created plan, whose eye is light, whose life is the breath of his nostrils. I placed within him life's unextinguishabl e power.\" Ormuzd or Ahura-Mazda himself represented the primal light, distinct from the heavenl y bodies, yet necessar y to their existence, and the source of their splendor. The Amschaspands (Ameschaspenta, \"immortal Holy Ones\"), each presided over a special department of nature. Earth and Heaven, fire and water, the Sun and Moon, the rivers, trees, and mounta ins, even the artifici al divisions of the da y and year were addressed in prayer as tenanted by Divine beings, each separatel y ruling within his several sphere. Fire, in particular, that \"most energetic of immortal powers,\" the visible representativ e of the primal light, was invoked as \"Son of Ormuzd.\" The Sun, the Archimagus, that noblest and most powerful agent of divine power, who \"steps forth as a Conqueror from the top of the terrible Alborj to rule over the world which he enlightens from the throne of Ormuzd,\" was worshipped among other s ymbols by the name of MITHRAS, a beneficent and friendl y genius, who, in the hymn addressed to him in the Zend- Avesta, bears the names given him by the Greeks, as the \"Invincible\" and the \"Mediator\"; the former, because in his dail y strife with darkness he is the most active confederate of Ormuzd; the latter, as being the medium through which Heaven's choicest blessings are com municated to men. He is called \"the eye of Ormuzd, the effulgent Nero, pursuing his course triu mphantly, fertilizer of deserts, most exalted of the Izeds or Yezatas, the never- sleeping, the protector of the land.\" \"When the dragon foe devastates my provinces,\" says Ormuzd, \"and afflicts them with famine, then is he struck down by the strong arm of Mithras, together with the Devs of Mazanderan.

Mithras is not only light, but intelligenc e; that luminary which, though born in obscurity, will not onl y dispel darkness but conquer death. The warfare through which this consum mation is to be reached, is mainly carried on through the instrument ality of the \"Word,\" that \"ever- living emanation of the Deit y, by virtue of which the world exists,\" and of which the revealed formulas incessantl y repeated in the liturgies of the Magi are but the expression. \"What shall I do,\" cried Zoroaster, \"O Ormuzd, steeped in brightness, in order to battle with Daroodj-A hriman, father of the Evil Law; how shall I make men pure and holy?\" Ormuzd answered and said: \"Invoke, O Zoroaster, the pure law of the Servants of Ormuzd; invoke the Amschaspands who shed abundance throughout the seven Ke shwars; invoke the Heaven, Zeruana- Akarana, the birds travailing on high, the swift wind, the Earth; invoke m y Spirit, me who am Ahura-Mazda, the purest, strongest, wisest, best of beings; me who have the most majestic body, who through purit y am Supreme, whose Soul is the Excellen t Word; and ye, all people, invoke m e as I have co mmanded Zoroaster.\" Ahura-Mazda himself is the living WORD; he is called \"First-born of all things, express image of the Eternal, very light of very light, the Creator, who b y power of the Word which he never ceases to pronounce, m ade in 365 day s the Heaven and the Earth.\" The Word is said in the Yashna to have existed before all, and to be itself a Yazata, a personified object of pra yer. It was revealed in Serosch, in Homa, and again, under Gushtasp, wa s manifested in Zoroaster. Between life and death, between sunshine and shade, Mithras is the present exemplification of the Primal Unity from which all things arose, and into which, through his med iation, all contrariet ies will ultimately be absorbed. His annual sacrifice is the Passover of the Magi, a symbolical atonement or pledge of moral and ph ysical regeneration. He created the world in the beginning; and as at the close of each successive year he sets free the current of life to invigorate a fresh circle of being, so in the end of all things he will bring the wear y sum of ages as a hecatom b before God, releasing by a final sacrifice the Soul of Nature from her perishable frame, to commence a brighter and purer existence. Iamblichus ( De Mys. viii. 4) says: \"The Egyptians are far from ascribing all things to physical causes; life and intellec t they distinguish from physical being, both in man and in the Universe.

The wisdom recorded in the canonical rolls of Hermes quickly attained in this transcendenta l lore, all that human curiosit y can ever discover. Thebes especiall y is said to have acknowledged a being without beginning or end, called Amun or Amun- Kneph, the all-pervading Spirit or Breath of Nature, or perhaps even some still more lofty object of reverentia l reflection, whom it was forbidden even to name. Such a being would in theory stand at the head of the three orders of G ods ment ioned by Herodotus, these being regarded as arbitrar y classifica tions of simi lar or equal beings, arranged in successive emanations, according to an estim ate of their compara tive dignity. The Eight Great Gods, or primar y class, were probably manifestations of the emanat ed God in the several parts and powers of the Universe, each potentiall y comprising the whole Godhead. In the ancient Herme tic books, as quoted by Iamblichus, occurred the following passage in regard to the Supreme Being: \"Before all the things that actuall y exist, and before all beginnings, there is one God, prior even to the first God and King, rema ining unmov ed in the singleness of his own U nity: for neither is anything conceived by intellec t inwoven with him, nor anything else; but he is established as the exemp lar of the God w ho is good, who is his own father, self- begotten, and has only one Parent. For he is something greater and prior to, and the fountain of all things, and the foundation of things conceived by the intellec t, which are the first species. And from this ONE, the self-originated God caused himself to shine forth; for which reason he is his o wn father, and self- originated. For he is both a beginning and God of Gods, a Monad from the One, prior to substance and the beginning of substance; for from him is substantiality and sub stance, whence also he is called the beginning of things conceived by the intell ect. These then are the most ancient beginnings of all things, which Hermes places before the ethereal and emp yrean and celestial Gods.\" \"CHANG-TI, or the Supreme Lord or Being,\" said the old Chinese creed, \"is the principle of everything that exists, and Father of all living. He is eternal, immovable, and independent : His power knows no bounds: His sight equall y compreh ends the Past, the Present, and the Future, and penetrates even to the inmost recesses of the heart. Heaven and earth are under his governmen t: all events, all revolutions, are the consequences of his dispensation and will. He is pure, hol y, and impar tial; wickedness offends his sight; but he beholds with an e ye of compla cency the virtuous actions of men. Severe, y et just, he punishes vice in an exempl ary manner, even in Princes and Rulers; and often casts do wn the guilty, to crown with honor the man who walks after his own heart, and whom he raises from obscurity.

Confucius forbade making images or representations of the Deity. He attached no idea of personalit y to Him; but considered Him as a Po wer or Principle, pervading all Nature. And the Chinese designated the Divinit y by the name of THE, DIVINE REASO N. The Japanese believe in a Supreme Invisible Being, not to be represented by images or worshipped in Temples.

The Ancients, with the view of connecting the act with its object, when the y established the practic e of sacrificing to the Chang-ti, fixed the day of the Winter Solstice, because the Sun, after having passed through the twelve places assigned apparentl y by the Chang-ti as its annual residence, began its career anew, to distribute blessings throughout the Earth.\" He said: \"The TEEN is the universal principle and prolific source of all things...

Their historical traditions had much analog y with those of the Hebrew s, and coincided with them in a variety of points. The tradition of a purer faith and the simp le Patriarcha l worship of the Deit y; appear never to have been totally extinguished among them; nor did idolatr y gain much foothold until near the time of Mahome t; who, adopting the old prim eval faith, taught again the doctrine of one God, adding to it that he was His Prophet. To the mass of Hebrews, as w ell as to other nations, seem to have come fragments only of the primitive revelation: nor do they seem, until after their captivit y among the Persians, to have concerned themselv es about m etaphysical speculations in regard to the Divine Nature and essence; although it is evident, from the Psalms of David, that a select body among them preserved a knowledge, in regard to the Deit y, which was wholly unknown to the mass of the people; and those chosen few were made the med ium of transition for certain truths, to later ages.

Much of the primitive Truth was taught to Pythagoras by Zoroaster, who himself received it from the Indians. His disciples rejected the use of Temp les, of Altars, and of Statues; and smiled at the foll y of those nations who imagin ed that the Deity sprang from or had any affinity with human nature. The tops of the highest mounta ins were the places chosen for sacrifices. Hymns and pra yers were their principal worship. The Supreme God, who fills the wide circle of Heaven, was the object to Whom they were addressed. Such is the testimony of Herodotus. Light they considered not so much as an object of worship, as rather the most pure and lively emblem of, and first emana tion from, the Eternal God; and thought that man required someth ing visible or tangible to exalt his mind to that degree of adoration which is due to the Divine Being. There was a surprising simil arity between the Temples, Priests, doctrines, and worship of the Persian Magi and the British Druids. The latter did not worship idols in the human shape, because they held that the Divinit y, being invisible, ought to be adored without being seen. The y asserted the Unity of the God-head. Their invocations were made to the One All- preserving Power; and the y argued that, as this power was not ma tter, it must necessaril y be the Deit y; and the secret symbol used to express his name was O. I. W. The y believed that the earth had sustained one general destruction by water; and would again be destroyed by fire. The y admitted the doctrines of the immortality of the soul, a future state, and a day of judgment, which would be conducted on the principle of man's respon sibility. They even retained some idea of the rede mption of mankind through the death of a Mediator. They retained a tradition of the Deluge, perverted and locali zed. But, around these fragments of primit ive truth the y wove a web of idolatr y, worshipped two Subordinate Deities under the names of Hu and CERIDWEN, male and fema le (doubtless the same as Osiris and Isis), and held the doctrine of trans migration. The early inhabitants of Scandinavia believed in a God who was \"the Author of ever ything that existeth; the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Aw ful Being, the Searcher into concealed things, the Being that never changeth.\" Idols and visible representations of the Deity were originall y forbidden, and He was directed to be wor shipped in the lonely solitude of sequestered forests, w here He was said to dwell, invisible, and in perfect silence. The Druids, like their Eastern ancestors, paid the most sacred regard to the odd numbers, which, traced backward, ended in Unity or Deit y, while the even numb ers ended in nothing. 3 was particularl y reverenced. 19 (7+3 +3 2 ): 30 (7×3+3×3): and 21 (7×3) were numbers observed in the erection of their temples, constantl y appearing in their dimensions, and the number and distances of the huge stones.

During this cere mony, the people were directed to make a great noise, that the Sacred Word migh t not be heard b y any who had not a right to it; for every other, said the Jews, w ould be incontinentl y stricken dead.

The Jews feared that the Heathen would get possession of the Name: and therefore, in their copies of the Scriptures, they wrote it in the Samar itan character, instead of the Hebrew or Chaldaic, that the adversar y might not make an improper use of it: for they believed it Page 445 of 621"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike capable of working miracles; and held that the wonders in Egypt were perfor med by Moses, in virtue of this name being engraved on his rod: and that any person who knew the true pronunciation would be able to do as much as he did.

The Druids expres sed the nam e of Deit y by the letters O ∴ I ∴ W ∴ Among all the nations of pri mitive antiquit y, the doctrine of the im mortality of the soul was not a m ere probable hypothesis, needing laborious researches and diffuse argumentation to produce conviction of its truth. Nor can we hardly give it the nam e of Faith ; for it was a livel y certainty , like the feeling of one's own existence and identit y, and of what is actuall y present; exerting its influence on all sublunary affairs, and the motive of mightier deeds and enterprises than any mere earthly interest could inspire. Even the doctrine of transmigration of souls, universal among the Ancient Hind s and ū Egyptians, rested on a basis of the old primitive religion, and was connected with a sentiment purely religious. It involved this noble element of truth: That since man ha d gone astray, and wandered far from God, he must needs make many efforts, and undergo a long and painful pilgrim age, before he could rejoin the Source of all Perfection: and the firm conviction and positive certaint y, that nothing defective, impure, or defiled with earthy stains, could enter the pure region of perfect spirits, or be eternall y united to God; wherefore the soul had to pass through long trials and man y purifications before it could attain that blissful end. And the end and aim of all these s ystems of philosoph y was the final deliveranc e of the soul from the old calam ity, the dreaded fate and frightful lot of being compe lled to wander through the dark regions of nature and the various forms of the brute creation, ever changing its terrestrial shape, and its union with God, w hich they held to be the loft y destiny of the wise and virtuous soul. Pythagoras gave to the doctrine of the transmigra tion of souls that meaning which the wise Egyptians gave to it in their Mysteries. He never taught the doctrine in that litera l sense in which it was understood b y the people. Of that literal doctrine not the least vestige is to be found in such of his sy mbols as remain, nor in his precepts collected by his disciple Lysias. He held that men always remain, in their essence, such as the y were created; and can degrade themse lves only by vice, and ennoble the mselves only by virtue. Page 446 of 621"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Hierocles, one of his most zealous and celebrated disciples, expressl y says that he who believes that the soul of man, after his death, will enter the bod y of a beast, for his vices, or become a plant for his stupidit y, is deceived; and is absolutel y ignorant of the eternal form of the soul, which can never change; for, alwa ys remaining man, it is said to become God or beast, through virtue or vice, though it can beco me neither one nor the other by nature, but solely by resemb lance of its inclinat ions to theirs. And Timæus of Locria, another disciple, says that to alarm men and prevent the m from committing crimes, they menaced them with strange humi liations and punishmen ts; even declaring that their souls would pass into new bodies, – that of a coward into the bod y of a deer; that of a ravisher into the body of a wolf; that of a murderer into the body of some still more ferocious ani mal; and that of an impure sensualist into the bod y of a hog. So, too, the doctrine is explained in the Phædo. And Ly sias days, that after the soul, purified of its crimes, has left the body and returned to Heaven, it is no longer subject to change or death, but enjoy s an eternal felicity. According to the Indians, it returned to, and became a part of, the universal soul which ani mates everything. The Hind s held that Buddha descended on earth to raise all human beings up to the ū perfect state. He will ultimately su cceed, and all, himself included, be merg ed in Unit y. Vishnu is to judge the world at the last day. It is to be consumed by fire: The Sun and Moon are to lose their light; the Stars to fall; and a New H eaven and Earth to be created. The legend of the fall of the Spirits, obscured and distorted, is preserved in the Hindu Mythology. And their traditions acknowledged, and they revered, the succession of the first ancestors of mankind, or the Holy Patriarchs of the primitive world, under the name of the Seven Great RISHIS, or Sages of hoary antiquit y; though the y invested their history with a cloud of fictions. The Egyptians held that the soul wa s immortal; and that Osiris was to judge the world. And thus reads the Persian legend: \"After Ahriman shall have ruled the world until the end of ti me, SOSIOSCH, the promised Redeemer, will com e and annihila te the power of the DEVS (or Evil Spirits), awaken the dead, and sit in final judgment upon spirits and m en. After that the comet Gurzsher will be thrown down, and a general conflagration take place, which will consume the whole world. The remains of the earth will then sink down into Duzakh , and become for three periods a place of punishmen t for the wicked. Then, by degrees, all will be pardoned, even Ahriman and the Devs , and admitted to the regions of bliss, and thus there will be a new Heaven and a new earth.\" In the doctrines of Lama ism also, we find, obscured, and partl y concealed in fiction, fragments of the primitive truth. For, according to that faith, \"There is to be a final judgment before ESLIK KH AN: The good are to be admi tted to Paradise, the bad to be banished to hell, where there are eight regions burning hot and eight freezing cold.\" Page 447 of 621"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike In the Mysteries, wherever the y were practised, was taught that truth of the primitive revelation, the existence of One Great Being, Infinite and pervading the Universe, Who was there worshipped without superstition; and Hi s marvellous nature, essence, and attributes taught to the Initiates; while the vulgar attribut ed His works to Secondar y Gods, personified, and isolated from Him in fabulous independence. These truths were covered from the common people as with a veil; and the Mysteries were carried into every country , that, without disturbing the popular beliefs, truth, the arts, and the sciences might be kno wn to those who were capable of understanding them, and maintaining the true doctrine incorrupt; which the people, prone to superstition and idolatry, have in no age been able to do; nor, as man y strange aberrations and superstitions of the present da y prove, any more now than heretofore. For we need but point to the doctrines of so man y sects that degrade the Creator to the rank, and assign to Him the passions of humani ty, to prove that now, as alwa ys, the old truths must be com mitted to a few, or the y will be overlaid with fiction and error, and irretrievab ly lost. Though Masonry is identica l with the Ancient Mysteries, it is so in this qualified sense; that it presents but an imperfe ct image of their brilli ancy; the ruins onl y of their grandeur, and a system that has experienced progressive alterations, the fruits of social events and political circumstances. Upon leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were mod ified by the habits of the different nations among whom they were introduced. Though original ly more moral and political than religious, they soon beca me the heritage, as it were, of the priests, and essentiall y religious, though in realit y limiting the sacerdotal power, by teaching the intelligent laity the folly and absurdity of the creeds of the populace. They were therefore necessaril y changed by the religious systems of the countries into which they were transplanted. In Greece, they were the Mysteries of Ceres; in Rome, of Bona Dea , the Good Goddes s; in Gaul, the School of Mars; in Sicil y, the Academ y of the Sciences; among the Hebrews, the y partook of the rites and ceremoni es of a religion which placed all the powers of govern ment, and all the knowledge, in the hands of the Priests and Levites. The pagodas of India, the retreats of the Magi of Persia and Chaldea, and the pyramids of Egypt, were no longer the sources at which men drank in knowledge. Each people, at all informed, had its Mysteries. After a ti me the Temples of Greece and the School of Pythagoras lost their reputation, and Freemasonr y took their place. Masonry , when properly expounded, is at once the interpretation of the great book of nature, the recital of physical and astronomical phenom ena, the purest philosoph y, and the place of deposit, where, as in a Treasury , are kept in safety all the great truths of the primitive revelation, that form the basis of all religions. In the modern Degrees three things are to be recognized : The image of primeva l times, the tableau of the efficient causes of the Universe, and the book in which are written the morality of all peoples, and the code b y which they must govern themselv es if they would be prosperous. The Kabalistic doctrine was long the religion of the Sage and the Savant; because, like Freemasonry, it incessantl y tends toward spiritual perfection, and the fusion of the creeds and Nationalities of Mankind. In the e yes of the Kabalist, all men are his brothers; and their relative ignorance is, to hi m, but a reason for instructing them. There were illustrious Kabalists among the Egyptians and Greeks, who se doctrines the Orthodox Church has Page 448 of 621"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike accepted ; and among the Arabs were man y, whose wisdom was not slighted by the Mediæval Church. The Sages proudly wore the name of Kabalists. The Kabalah embodied a noble philosoph y, pure, not mysterious, but symbolic. It taught the doctrine of the Unity of God, the art of knowing and explaining the essence and operations of the Supreme Being, of spiritual powers and natural forces, and of determining their action by symbolic figures; by the arrangem ent of the alphabet, the combinations of numbers, the inversion of letters in writing and the concealed meanings which they claimed to discover therein. The Kabalah is the key of the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists. The science of numbers represented not onl y arithmetical qualities, but also all grandeur, all proportion. By it we necessaril y arrive at the discover y of the Principle or First Cause of things, called at the present day THE ABS OLUTE. Or UNITY, – that loftiest term to which all philosophy directs itself; that imperious necessit y of the human mind, that pivot round which it is comp elled to group the aggregate of its ideas: Unit y, this source, this centre of all systematic order, this principle of existence, this central point, unknown in its essence, but manif est in its effects; Unity, that sublime centre to which the chain of causes necessaril y ascends, was the august Idea toward which all the ideas of Pythagoras converged. He refused the titl e of Sage , which means one who knows . He invented, and applied to himself that of Philosopher , signify ing one who is fond of or studies things secret and occult . The astronom y which he mysteriously taught, was astrology : his science of numbers was based on Kabalistical principles. The Ancients, and Pythagoras himself, whose real principles have not been always understood, never mean t to ascribe to numbers, that is to sa y, to abstract signs, an y special virtue. But the Sages of Antiquit y concurred in recognizing a ONE FIRST CAU SE (material or spiritual) of the existence of the Universe. Thence, UNITY becam e the symbol of the Supreme Deity. It was made to express, to represent God; but without attributing to the mere, number ONE any divine or supernatural virtue.

The unit is the symbol of identit y, equalit y, existence, conservation, and general harmon y; the Central Fire, the Point within the Circle. Two , or the duad , is the s ymbol of diversit y, inequalit y, division, separation, and vicissitudes. The figure 1 signifies the living man [a body standing upright]; man being the only living being possessed of this facult y. Adding to it a head, we have the letter P, the sign of Paternit y, Creative Power; and with a further addition, R, signify ing man in motion, going, Iens , Ituru s . The Duad is the origin of contrasts. It is the i mperfec t condition into which, according to the Pythagoreans, a being falls, when he detaches himself from the Monad, or God. Spiritual beings, emana ting from God, are enveloped in the duad, and therefore receive only illusory impressions. As formerl y the number ONE designated harmony, order, or the Good P rinciple (the ONE and ONLY G OD, expressed in Latin by Solus , whence the words Sol , Soleil , symbol of this God), the number Two expressed the contrar y idea. There commenced the fatal knowledge of good and evil. Everything double, false, opposed to the single and sole reality, was expressed b y the Binary number. It expressed also that state of contrariet y in which nature exists, where everything is double; night and day , light and darkness, cold and heat, wet and dry , health and sickness, error and truth, one and the other sex, etc. Hence the Romans dedicated the second month in the year to Pluto, the God of Hell, and the second da y of that month to the manès of the dead. The number One , with the Chinese, signified unity, harmon y, order, the Good Principle, or God; Two , disorder, duplicit y, false-hood. That people, in the earliest ages, based their whole philosophical system on the two primar y figures or lines, one straight and unbroken, and the other broken or divided into two; doubling which, by placing one under the other, Page 453 of 621"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and trebling by placing three under each other, the y made the four s ymbols and eight Koua ; which referred to the natural elements, and the primar y principles of all things, and served s ymbolically or scientifi cally to express the m. Plato terms unity and dualit y the original elemen ts of nature, and first principles of all existence : and the oldest sacred book of the Chinese sa ys: \"The Great First Principle has produced two equations and differences, or prim ary rules of existence ; but the two primar y rules or two oppositions, namely YN and YA NG, or repose and mot ion, have produced four signs or sy mbols, and the four sy mbols have produced the eight KOUA or further combina tions.\" The interpretat ion of the Hermet ic fables shows, among every ancient people, in their principal gods, first, 1, the Creating Monad, then 3, then 3 times 3, 3 times 9, and 3 times 27. This triple progres sion has for its foundation the three ages of Nature, the Past, the Present, and the Future; or the three degrees of universal generation... Birth, Life, Death... Beginning, middle, end. The Monad wa s male, because its action produces no change in itself, but onl y out of itself. It represented the creative principle. The Duad, for a contrar y reason, was femal e, ever changing b y addition, subtraction, or multiplication. It represents ma tter capable of form. The union of the Monad and Duad produces the Triad, signify ing the world formed by the creative principle out of matter. Pythagoras represented the world b y the right-angled triangle, in which the squares of the two shortest sides are equal, added together, to the square of the longest one; as the world, as formed, is equal to the creative cause, and ma tter clothed with form. The ternary is the first of the unequal numbers. The Triad, mysterious number, which pla ys so great a part in the traditions of Asia and the philosophy of Plato, image of the Supreme Being, includes in itself the properties of the first two numbers. It was, to the Philosophers, the most excellen t and favorite number: a mysterious type, revered by all antiquit y, and consecrated in the M ysteries; wherefore there are but three essential Degrees among Masons; who venerate, in the triangle, the most august m ystery, that of the Sacred Triad, object of their homag e and stud y. In geom etry, a line cannot represent a body absolutel y perfect. As little do two lines constitute a figure demonstrat ively perfect. But three lines form, by their junction, the TRIANGLE, or the first figure regularl y perfect; and this is why it has served and still serves to charact erize The Eternal ; Who, infinitel y perfect in His nature, is, as Universal Creator, the first Being, and consequentl y the first Perfection. The Quadrangle or Square, perfect as it appears, being but the second perfection, can in no wise represent God; Who is the first. It is to be noted that the name of God in Latin and French (Deus, Dieu), has for its initial the Delta or Greek Triangle. Such is the reason, among ancients and moderns, for the consecration of the Triangle, whose three sides are emblems of the three Kingdoms, or Nature, or God. In the cen tre is the Hebrew JO D (initial of יהוה ), the Anima ting Spirit of Fire, the generative principle, represented by the Page 454 of 621"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike letter G., initial of the name of Deity in the languages of the North, and the m eaning whereof is Generation. The first side of the Triangle, offered to the study of the Apprentice, is the min eral kingdom, symbolized by Tub ∴ The second side, the subject of the med itations of the Fellow Craft, is the vegetable kingdom, symbolized by Schib ∴ (an ear of corn). In this reign begins the Generation of bodies; and this is wh y the letter G., in its radiance, is presented to the eyes of the adept. The third side, the stud y whereof is devoted to the ani mal kingdom, and comple tes the instruction of the Master, is s ymbolized by Mach ∴ (Son of putrefaction). The figure 3 s ymbolizes the Earth. It is a figure of the terrestrial bodies. The 2, upper half of 3, symbolizes the vegetable world, the lower half being hidden from our sight. Three also referred to harmony, friendship, peace, concord, and te mperan ce; and wa s so highly esteem ed among the Pythagoreans that they called it perfect harmon y. Three, four, ten, and twelve were sacred numbers among the Etrurians, as they wer e among the Jews, Egyptians, and Hind s. ū The name of Deity , in many Nations, consisted of three letters: among the Greeks, Ι ∴ Α ∴ Ω ∴ ; among the Persians, H ∴ O ∴ M ∴ ; among the Hind s, AUM; among the ū Scandinavians, I ∴ O ∴ W ∴ . On the upright Tablet of the King, discovered at Nimroud, no less than five of the thirteen names of the Great Gods consist of three letters each, – AN U, SAN, YAV, BAR, and BEL. The quaternar y is the most perfect number, and the root of other numbers, and of all things. The tetrad expresses the first mathematical power. Four represents also the generative power, from which all combina tions are derived. The Initiates considered it the emblem of Movemen t and the Infinite, representing everything that is neither corporeal nor sen sible. Pythagoras communicated it to his disciples as a sy mbol of the Eternal and Creative Principle, under the nam e of Quaternar y, the Ineffable Name of God, w hich signifies Source of every thing that has received existence; and which, in Hebrew, is composed of four letters. In the Quaternar y we find the first solid figure, the universal symbol of immortality, the pyramid. The Gnostics claimed that the whole edifice of their science rested on a square whose angles were... Σιγ ή , Silence : Βυθος Profundity : Νοος, Intellig ence : and Αληθεια, Truth . For if the Triangle, figured by the number 3, forms the triangular base of the pyramid, it is unity which forms its point or summit. Lysias and Timæus of Locria said that not a single thing could be na med, which did not depend on the quaternar y as its root.

The soul is a number: it is moved of itself: it contains in itself the quaternar y number. Matter being represented by the number 9, or 3 tim es 3, and the Immortal Spirit having for its essential hierogl yphic the quaternar y or the numb er 4, the Sages s aid that Man, having gone astray and beco me entangled in an inextric able labyrinth, in going from four to nine , the only way which he could take to emerge from these deceitfu l paths, these disastrous detours, and the ab yss of evil into which he had plunged, was to retrace his steps, and go from nine to four . The ingenious and mystical idea which caused the Triangle to be venerated, was applied to the figure 4 (4). It was said that it expressed a living being, I, bearer of the Triangle △ , the emblem of God; i.e. , man bearing with himself a Divine principle. Four was a divine number; it referred to the Deity, and man y Ancient Nations gave God a name of four letters; as the Hebrews יהוה , the Egyptians AMUN, the Persians S URA, the Greeks ΘΕΟΣ, and the Latins DEUS. This was the Tetragra mmaton of the Hebrew s, and the Pythagoreans called it Tetrac tys, and sw ore their most solemn oath by it. So too O DIN among the Scandinavians, ΖΕΥΣ among the Greeks, P HTA among the Egyptians, THOTH among the Ph œnicians, and AS -UR and NEBO among the Assyrians. The list might be indefinit ely extended. The number 5 was considered as mysterious, because it was compound ed of the Binary , Symbol of the False and Double, and the Ternar y, so interesting in its results. It thus energetic ally expresses the state of imperf ection, of order and disorder, of happiness and misfortun e, of life and death, which we see upon the earth. To the Mysterious Societies it offered the fearful image of the Bad Principle, bringing trouble into the inferior order, – in a word, the Binary acting in the Ternar y. Under another aspect it was the emblem of marr iage; because it is composed of 2, the first equal number, and of 3, the first unequal number. Wherefore Juno, the Goddess of Marriage, had for her hierogly phic the number 5. Moreover, it has one of the properties of the number 9, that of reproducing itself, when multiplied by itself: there being alwa ys a 5 on the right hand of the product; a result which led to its use as a symbol of material changes. The ancients represented the world by the number 5. A reason for it, given by Diodoru s, is, t hat it represents earth, water, air, fire, and ether or spirit. Thence the origin of πεντε (5) and Παν the Universe, as the whole. The number 5 designated the universal quintessence, and symbolized, by its form ς, the vital essence, the ani mating spirit, w hich flows [ serpentat ] through all nature. In fact, this ingenious figure is the union of the two Greek accents ‘ ’, placed over those vowels which ought to be or ought not to be aspirated. The first sign ‘ bears the nam e of potent spirit; and signifies the Superior Spirit, the Spirit of God a spirated ( spiratus ), respired by man. The Page 456 of 621"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike second sign ’ is st yled mild spirit, and represents the secondary spirit, the spirit purely human. The triple triangle, a figure of five lines uniting in five points, wa s among the Pythagoreans an emblem of Health. It is the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, or Pentangle of Solomon; has five lines and five angles; and is, among Mason s, the outline or origin of the five- pointed Star, and an emble m of Fellowship. The number 6 was, in the Ancient Mysteries, a striking emblem of nature; as presenting the six dim ensions of all bodies; the six lines which make up their form, viz., the four lines of direction, toward the North, South, East, and West; with the two lines of height and depth, responding to the zenith and nadir. The sages applied the senary to the physical man; while the septenar y was, for the m, the symbol of his im mortal spirit. The hierogl yphical senary (the double equilat eral triangle) is the symbol of Deit y. Six is also an embl em of health, and the s ymbol of justice; because it is the first perfect number ; that is, the first who se aliquot parts (1/2, 1/3, 1/6, or 3, 2, and 1), added together, make itself. Ormuzd created six good spirits, and Ahrim an six evil ones. These t ypify the six Summer and the six Winter months. No number has ever been so universall y in repute as the septenar y. Its celebrit y is due, no doubt, to the planets being seven in numb er. It belongs also to sacred things. The Pythagoreans regarded it as formed of the numbers 3 and 4; the first whereof was, in their eyes, the image of the three material elements, and the second the principle of ever ything that is neither corporeal nor sensible. It presented them, from that point of view, the emblem of every thing that is perfect. Considered as composed of 6 and unit y, it serves to designate the invisible centre or soul of everything; because no bod y exists, of which six lines do not constitute the form, nor without a seventh interior point, as the centre and realit y of the body, whereof the external dimensions give onl y the appearance. The numerous applicat ions of the septenar y confirmed the ancient sages in the use of this symbol. Moreover, they exalted the properties of the number 7, as having, in a subordinate manner, the perfection of the unit: for if the unit is untreated, if no number produces it, the seven is also not engendered by any number contained in the interval between 1 and 10. The number 4 occupies an arith metical middle-ground between the unit and 7, inasmuch as it is as much over 1, as it is under 7, the difference each way being 3. The number 7, among the Egyptians, symbolized life; and this is why the letter Ζ of the Greeks was the initia l of the verb Ζάω, I live; and Ζε ὺ ς (Jupiter), Father of Life. The number 8, or the octary, is composed of the sacred numbers 3 and 5. Of the heavens, of the seven planets, and of the sphere of the fixed stars, or of the eternal unity and the Page 457 of 621"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike mysterious number 7, is co mposed the ogdoade, the number 8, the first cube of equal numbers, regarded as sacred in the arithmetical philosophy . The Gnostic ogdoade had eight stars, w hich represented the eight Cabiri of Samo thrace, the eight Egyptian and Phœnician principles, the eight gods of Xenocrates, the eight angles of the cubic stone. The number eight symbolizes perfection: and its figure, 8 or ∞ indicates the perpetual and regular course of the Universe. It is the first cube (2 × 2 × 2), and signifies friendship, prudence, counsel, and justice. It was a s ymbol of the primev al law which regarded all men as equal. The novary , or triple ternary. If the number three was celebrated among the ancient sages, that of three times three had no less celebrit y; because, according to them, each of the three elements which constitute our bodies is ternar y: the water containing earth and fire; the earth containing igneous and aqueous particl es; and the fire being tempered by globules of water and terrestrial corpuscles which serve to feed it. No one of the three ele ments being entirely separated from the others, all material beings composed of these three elements, whereof each is triple, may be designated by the figurative number of three times three, which has become the symbol of all formations of bodies. Hence the name of ninth envelope, given to matter. Every material extension, every circular line, has for representativ e sign the number nine, among the Pythagoreans; who had observed the propert y which this numb er possesses, of reproducing itself incessantl y and entire, in ever y multiplication; thus offering to the mind a very striking emblem of matt er which is incessantl y composed before our e yes, after having undergone a thousand decomposi tions. The number nine was consecrated to the Spheres and the Muses. It is the sign of every circumference; because a circle of 360 degrees is equal to 9, that is to say , 3 + 6 + 0 = 9. Nevertheless, the ancients regarded this number with a sort of terror: they considered it a bad presage; as the symbol of versatilit y, of change, and the emblem of the frailty of human affairs. Wherefore they avoided all numbers where nine appears, and chiefl y 81, the product of 9 mult iplied by itself, and the addition whereof, 8 + 1, again presents the number 9. As the figure of the number 6 was the s ymbol of the terrestrial globe, ani mated by a divine spirit, the figure of the number 9 symbolized the earth, under the influence of the Evil Principle; and thence the terror it inspired. Nevertheless, according to the Kabalists, the figure 9 symbolizes the generative egg, or the image of a littl e globular being, from whose lower side seems to flow its spirit of life. The Ennead, signify ing an aggregate of 9 things or persons, is the first square of unequal numbers. Every one is aware of the singular properties of the number 9, which, multiplied by itself or any other number whatever, gives a result whose final sum is alwa ys 9, or alwa ys divisible by 9.

Containing all the numer ical and harmon ic relations, and all the properties of the numbers which precede it, it concludes the Abacus or Table of Pythagoras. To the M ysterious Societies, this number typified the assembl age of all the wonders of the Universe. They wrote it t hus θ, that is to say, Unity in the middle of Zero, as the centre of a circle, or symbol of Deity . They saw in this figure everything that should lead to reflect ion: the centre, the ray, and the circum ference, represented to them God, Man, and the Universe . This number was, among the Sages, a sign of concord, love, and peace. To Masons it is a sign of union and good faith; because it is expressed by joining two hand s, or the Master' s grip, when the number of fingers gives 10: and it was represented by the Tetract ys of Pythagoras. The number 12, like the number 7, is celebrated in the worship of nature. The two most famous divisions of the heavens, that by 7, which is that of the planets, and that by 12, which is that of the Signs of the Zodiac, are found upon the religious monum ents of all the peoples of the Ancient World, even to the remo te extremes of the East. Although Pythagoras does not speak of the number 12, it is none the less a sacred number. It is the image of the Zodiac; and consequentl y that of the Sun, which rules over it. Such are the ancient ideas in regard to those numbers which so often appear in Masonry; and rightly understood, as the old Sages under stood them, they contain many a pregnant lesson. Before we enter upon the final lesson of Masonic Philosophy , we will delay a few moments to repeat to you the Christian interpret ations of the Blue Degrees. In the First Degree, the y said, there are three s ymbols to be applied. 1 st Man, after the fall, was left naked and defenceless against the just anger of the Deity. Prone to evil, the human race staggered blindly onward into the thick darkness of unbelief, bound fast by the strong cable- tow of the natural and sinful will. Moral corruption was followed by physical misery. Want and destitution invaded the earth. War and Famine and Pestilence filled up the measure of evil, and over the sharp flints of misfortune and wretchedness man toiled with naked and bleeding feet. This condition of blindness, destitution, misery, and bondage, from which to save the world the Redee mer came, is symbolized by the condition of the candidate, when he is brought up for the first tim e to the door of the Lodge. 2 nd Notwithstanding the death of the Redeem er, man can be saved only by faith, repentance, and reforma tion. To repent, he must feel the sharp sting of conscience and remorse, like a sword piercing his bosom. His confidence in his guide, whom he is told to follow and fear no danger; his trust in God, w hich he is caused to profess; and the point of the sword that is pressed against his naked left breast over the heart, are symbolical of the faith, repentance and reforma tion necessary to bring him to the light of a life in Christ the Crucified. Page 460 of 621"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike 3 rd Having repented and reformed, and bound himself to the service of God by a firm promise and obligation, the light of Christian hope shines down into the darkness of the heart of the humble penitent, and blazes upon his pathwa y to Heaven. And this is symbolized by the candidate's being brought to light, after he is obligated, by the Worshipful Master, who in that is a symbol of the Redee mer, and so brings hi m to light, with the help of the brethren, as He taught the Word with the aid of the Apostles. In the Second Degree there are two symbols: 4 th The Christian assumes new duties toward God and his fellows. Toward G od, of love, gratitude, and veneration, and an anxious desire to serve and glorif y Him; toward his fellows, of kindnes s, sympathy, and justice. And this assumpt ion of duty, this entering upon good works, is sy mbolized by the Fellow- Craft's obligation; by which, bound as an apprentice to secrec y merely, and set in the Northeast corner of the Lodge, he descends as a Fellow-Craft into the body of the brethren, and assumes the active duties of a good Mason. 5 th The Christian, reconciled to God, sees the world in a new light. This great Universe is no longer a mere machine, wound up and set going six thousand or sixt y millions years ago, and left to run on afterward forever, b y virtue of a law of mechan ics created at the beginning, without further care or consideration on the part of the Deit y; but it has now become to him a great e manation from God, the product of His thought, not a mer e dead machine, but a thing of life, over which God watches continual ly, and every movement of which is imm ediately produced by His present action, the law of harmon y being the essence of the Deit y, re-enacted every instant. And this is symbolized by the imperfec t instruction given in the Fellow-Craft's Degree, in the sciences, and particul arly geometr y, connected as the latter is with God Himself in the mind of a Mason, because the same letter, suspended in the East, represents both; and astrono my, or the knowledge of the laws of motion and harmon y that govern the spheres, is but a portion of the wider science of geometry. It is so symbolized, because it is here, in the Second Degree, that the candidate first receives an other than moral instruction. There are also two sy mbols in the Third Degree, which, with the 3 in the first, and 2 in the second, m ake the 7. 6 th The candidate, after passing through the first part of the ceremon y, imagines himself a Master; and is surprised to be informed that as yet he is not, and that it is uncertain whether he ever will be. He is told of a difficult and dangerous path y et to be travelled, and is advised that upon that journey it depends whether he will beco me a Master. This is symbolical of that which our Saviour said to Nicodemus, that, notwithstanding his morals might be beyond reproach, he could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he were born again; symbolically dying, and again entering the world regenerat e, like a spotless infant. 7 th The murder of Hira m, his burial, and his being raised again by the Master, are symbols, both of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Redeem er; and of the death and burial in sins of the natural man, and his being raised again to a new life, or born again, by the direct action of the Redeemer; after Morality (symbolized by the Entered Apprentice's grip), and Philosoph y (symbolized by the grip of the Fellow-Craft), had failed to raise him. That of Page 461 of 621"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the Lion of the Hou se of Judah is the strong grip, never to be broken, with which Christ, of the royal line of that House, has clasped to Himself the whole human race, and embrac es them in His wide ar ms as closely and affectionate ly as brethren embrace each other on the five points of fellowship. As Entered Apprentices and Fellow-Crafts, Masons are taught to imitate the laudable example of those Mason s who labored at the building of King Solomon's Temple; and to plant firmly and deep in their hearts those foundation- stones of principle, truth, justice, temperanc e, fortitude, prudence, and charit y, on which to erect that Christian character which all the storms of misfortune and all the powers and temptations of Hell shall not prevail against; those feelings and noble affections which are the most proper homage that can be paid to the Grand Architect and Great Father of the Universe, and which m ake the heart a living temple builded to Him: when the unrul y passions are made to submit to rule and measurem ent, and their excesses are struck off with the gavel of self-restraint; and when ever y action and ever y principle is accurate ly corrected and adjusted b y the square of wisdom, the level of humi lity, and the plumb of justice. The two columns, Jachin and Boaz, are the symbols of that profound faith and impl icit trust in God and the Redee mer that are the Christian's strength ; and of those good work s by which alone that faith can be established and made operative and effectual to salvation. The three pillars that support the Lodge are symbols of a Christian's HOPE; in a future state of happiness; FAITH in the promises and the divine character and mission of the Redeemer; and CHARITABLE JU DGMENT of other m en. The three murderers of Khir-Om symbolize Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas the High-Priest, and Judas Iscariot: and the three blows given him are the betrayal by the last, the refusal of Roman protection by Pilate, and the conde mnation by the High-Priest. The y also symbolize the blow on the ear, the scourging, and the crown of thorns. The twelve fellow- crafts sent in search of the bod y are the twelve disciples, in doubt whether to believe that the Redeem er would rise from the dead. The Master's word, suppo sed to be lost, s ymbolizes the Christian faith and religion, supposed to have been crushed and destroy ed when the Saviour was crucified, after Iscariot had betra yed Him, and Peter deserted Him, and when the other disciples doubted whether He would arise from the dead; but which rose from His tomb and flowed rapidly over the civiliz ed world; and so that which was supposed to be lost was found . It symbolizes also the Saviour Himself ; the WORD that was in the beginning – that was with God, and that was God; the Word of life, that was made flesh and dwelt among us, and was supposed to be lost, while He lay in the tomb, for three days, and His disciples \"as yet knew not the scripture that He must rise again from the dead,\" and doubted when the y heard of it, and were amaz ed and frightened and still doubted when He appeared among them. The bush of acacia placed at the head of the grave of Khir-Om is an emb lem of resurrection and immortality.

CLOSI NG INST RUCT ION. There is no pretence to infallibi lity in Masonry . It is not for us to dictat e to any man what he shall believe. We have hitherto, in the instruction of the several Degrees, confined ourselves to laying before y ou the great thoughts that have found expression in the different ages of the world, leaving you to decide for yourself as to the orthodoxy or heterodox y of each, and what proportion of truth, if any, each contained. We shall pursue no other course in this closing Philosophical instruction; in which we propo se to deal with the highest questions that have ever exercised the human mind, with the existence and the nature of a God, with the existence and the nature of the human soul, and with the relations of the divine and human spirit with the mer ely material Universe. There can be no questions more important to an intell igent being, none that have for him a more direct and personal interest; and to this last word of Scottish Masonry we invite your serious and attentive consideration. And, as what we shall now say will be but the comple tion and rounding- off of w hat we have alread y said in several of the preceding Degrees, in regard to the Old Thought and the Ancient Philosophies, we hope that you have noted and not forgotten our previous lessons, without which this would seem imperfe ct and fragment ary. In its idea of rewarding a faithful and intelligen t workman by conferring upon him a knowledge of the True Word, Masonry has perpetuated a very great truth, because it involves the proposition that the idea which a man forms of God is alwa ys the most important element in his speculative theory of the Universe, and in his particular practica l plan of action for the Church, the State, the Comm unity, the Family, and his own individual life. It will ever mak e a vast difference in the conduct of a people in war or peace, whether they believe the Supreme God to be a cruel Deity, delighting in sacrifice and blood, or a God of Love; and an individual's speculative theory as to the mode and extent of God' s governm ent, and as to the nature and reality of his own free-will and consequent responsibilit y, will needs have great influence in shaping the course of his life and conversation. We see every day the vast influence of the popular idea of God. All the great historical civilizations of the race have grown out of the national ideas which were formed of God; or have been inti mately connected with those ideas. The popular Theolog y, which at first is only an abstract idea in the heads of philosophers, b y and by shows itself in the laws, and in the punishmen ts for crime, in the churches, the ceremon ies and the sacram ents, the festivals and the fasts, the weddings, the baptisms and the funerals, in the hospitals, the colleges, the schools, and all the social charities, in the relations of husband and wife, parent and child, in the dail y work and the daily prayer of ever y man. As the world grows in its develop ment, it necessaril y out grows its ancient ideas of God, which were only tempor ary and pro-visional. A man who has a higher conception of God than those about him, and who denies that their conception is God, is very likely to be called an Atheist by men who are reall y far less believers in a God than he. Thus the Christians, who said the Heathen idols were no Gods, were accounted Atheists by the Page 463 of 621"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike People, and accordingl y put to death; and Jesus of Nazareth was crucified as an unbelieving blasphemer, by the Jews. There is a mer e formal Atheism, which is a denial of God in terms , but not in reality . A man says, There is no God; that is, no God that is self-originated, or that never originated, but always WAS and HAD BEEN, who is the cause of existence, who is the Mind and the Providence of the Universe; and so the order, beaut y, and harmon y of the world of ma tter and mind do not indicate any plan or purpose of Deit y. But, he sa ys, NATURE, – m eaning by that the whole sum-total of existence, – that is powerful, active, wise, and good; Nature is self-originated, or alwa ys was and had been, the cause of its own existence, the mind of the Universe and the Providence of itself. There is obviousl y a plan and purpose w hereby order, beauty , and harmon y are brought about; but all that is the plan and purpose of nature. In such cases, the absolute denial of God is only formal and not real. The qualities of God are admitted, and affirm ed to be real; and it is a mere change of name to call the posses sor of those qualities, Nature , and not God . The real question is, whether such Qualities exist, as we call God; and not, by what particular name we shall designate the Qualities. One man may call the sum total of these Qualities, Nature; another, Heaven; a third, Universe, a fourth, Matter; a fifth, Spirit; a sixth, God, Theos, Zeus, Alfadir, Allah, or what he pleases. All admit the existence of the Being, Power, or ENS, thus diversel y named. The name is of the smallest consequence. Real Atheism is the denial of the existence of any God, of the actualit y of all possible ideas of God. It denies that there is any Mind, Intelligenc e, or ENS, that is the Cause and Providence of the Universe, and of an y Thing or any Existence, Soul, Spirit, or Being, that intentiona lly or intelligen tly produces the Order, Beaut y, and Harmony thereof, and the constant and regular modes of operation therein. It must necessaril y deny that there is an y law, order, or harmon y in existence, or any constant mode of operation in the world; for it is utterl y impossible for any human creature to conceive, however mu ch he may pretend to do so, of either of these, except as a consequence of the action of Intelligence ; which is, indeed, that otherwise unknown thing, the existence of which these alone prove; otherwise than as the cause of these, not a thing at all; a mere name for the wholly uncognizable cause of these. The real atheist must deny the existence of the Qualities of God, den y that there is an y mind of or in the Universe, an y self-conscious Providence, any Providence at all. He must deny that there is any Being or Cause of Finite things, that is self-consciously powerful, wise, ju st, loving, and faithful to itself and its own nature. He must deny that there is any plan in the Universe or any part of it. He must hold, either that matter is eternal, or that it originated itself, which is absurd, or that it was originated by an Intelligenc e, or at least by a Cause; and then he adm its a God. No doubt it is beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine how matter originated, – how it began to be , in space where before was nothing, or God only . But it is equall y beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine it eternal and un originated. To hold it to be eternal, without thought or will; that the specific forms of it, the seed, the rock, the tree, the man, the solar system, all came with no forethought planning or producing them, by \"chance\" or \"the fortuitous concourse of ato ms\" of matter Page 464 of 621"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike that has no thought or will; and that they indicate no mind, no plan, no purpo se, no providence, is absurd. It is not to den y the existence of what we understand b y mind, plan, purpose, Providence; but to insist that these words shall have some other meaning than that which the human race has ever attached to them : shall mean some unknown thing, for which the human race has no name , because it has of s uch a thing no possible idea. Either there never was any such thing as a \"plan,\" and the word is nonsense, or the Universe exists in conformi ty to a plan. The word never meant, and never can me an, any other thing than that which the Universe exhibits. So with the word \" purpose ;\" so with the word \" Providence .\" They mean nothing, or else onl y what the Universe proves. It was soon found that the denial of a Con scious Power, the cause of man and of his life, of a Providence, or a Mind and Intelligenc e arranging man in reference to the world, and the world in reference to man, would not satisf y the instinctive desires of human nature, or account for the facts of material nature. It did not long answer to sa y, if it ever was said, that the Universe was drifting in the void inane, and neither it, nor any mind within or without it, knew of its whence, its whither, or its whereabouts; that man was drifting in the Universe, knowing litt le of his whereabouts, nothing of his whence or whither; that there was no Mind, no Providence, no Power, that knew an y better; nothing hat guided and directed man in his drifting, or the Universe in the weltering waste of Time. To say to man and woman, \"your heroism, your bravery, your self-denial all comes to nothing: your nobleness will do you no good: y ou will die, and yo ur nobleness will do mankind no service; for there is no plan or order in all these things; ever ything comes and goes b y the fortuitous con-course of ato ms;\" did not, nor ever will, long satisf y the human mind. True, the theor y of Atheism has been uttered. It has been said, \"Death is the end: this is a world without a God: y ou are a body without a soul: there is a Here, but no Hereafter for you; an Earth, but no Heaven. Die, and return to your dust. Man is bones, blood, bowels, and brain; m ind is matter: there is no soul in the brain, nothing but nerves. We can see all the way to a litt le star in the nebula of Orion's belt; so distant that it will take light a thousand millions of years to com e from it to the earth, journeying at the rate of twelve millions of miles a minut e. There is no Heaven this side of that: you see all the way through: there is not a speck of Heaven; and do you think there is any beyond it; and if so, when would y ou reach it? There is no P rovidence. Nature is a fortuitous concourse of atoms; thought is a fortuitous function of matt er, a fortuitous result of a fortuitous result, a chance- shot from the great wind-gun of the Universe, accidenta lly loaded, pointed at random, and fired off by chance.

Is it eternal, or did it originate?\" And then in succession cam e crowding on the human mind these other questions: \"Is this ma terial Universe a mere aggregate of fortuitous combina tions of matter, or is it the result and work of intelligen ce, acting upon a plan? \"If there be such an Intelligen ce, what and where is it?

What the old philosophic mind thought upon these great questions, we have alread y, to some extent, developed. With the Em anation-doctrine of the Gnostics and the Orient, we have endeavored to make you familiar. We have brought y ou face to face with the Kabalists, the Essenes, and Philo the Jew. We have sho wn that, and how, much of the old mythology was derived from the daily and yearly recurring pheno mena of the heavens. We have exhibited to you the ancient notions by which the y endeavored to explain to themselves the existence and prevalence of evil; and we have in some degree mad e known to you their metaph ysical ideas as to the nature of the Deit y. Much more remains to be done than it is within our power to do. We stand upon the sounding shore of the great ocean of Time. In front of us stretches out the heaving waste of the illimitable Past; and its waves, as the y roll up to our feet along the sparkling slope of the yellow sands, bring to us, now and then, from the depths of that boundless ocean, a shell, a few specimens of algæ torn rudely from their ste ms, a rounded pebble; and that is all; of all the vast treasures of ancient thought that lie buried there, with the mighty anthem of the boundless ocean thundering over the m forever and forever. Let us once more, and for the last time, along the shore of that great ocean, gather a few more relics of the Past, and listen to its migh ty voices, as they come, in fragm entary music, in broken and interrupted rhythm, whispering to us from the great bosom of the Past. Rites, creeds, and legends express, directl y or symbolically, some leading idea, according to which the Mysteries of Being are supposed to be explained in Deity. The intricaci es of mythical genealogies are a practica l acknowledg ment of the m ysterious nature of the Omnipot ent Deity; displaying in their beautiful but ineffectu al imagery the first efforts of the mind to comm unicate with nature: the flowers which fanc y strewed before the youthful steps of Psy che, when she first set out in pursuit of the im mortal object of her love. Theories and notions, in all their varieties of truth and falsehood, are a m achiner y more or less efficacious, directed to the same end. Every religion was, in its origin, an embryo philosoph y, or an attem pt to interpret the unknown by mind; and it was only when philosoph y, which is essentially progress, outgrew its first acquisitions, that religion became a thing apart, cherishing as unalterabl e dogmas the notions which philosophy had abandoned. Separated from philosoph y, it became arrogant and fantastical, professing to have already attained what its more authentic representative was ever pursuing in vain; and discovering, through its initiations and My steries, all that to its contracted view seemed wanting to restore the well- being of m ankind, the means of purificat ion and expiation, remedies for disease, expedients to cure the disorders of the soul, and to propitiat e the gods. Why should we attempt to confine the idea of the Suprem e Mind within an arbitrar y barrier, or exclude from the limits of veracit y any conception of the Deit y, which, if Page 468 of 621"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike imperfect and inadequate, may be only a little more so than our own ? \"The name of God,\" says Hobbe s, \"is used not to make us conceive Him, for He is inconceivable, but that we may hono r Him.\" \"Believe in God, and adore Him,\" said the Greek Poet, \"but investigate Him not; the inquiry is fruitless, seek not to discover who God is; for, b y the desire to know, yo u offend Him who chooses to rem ain unknown.\" \"When we attem pt,\" says Philo, \"to investigate the essence of the Absolute Being, we fall into an ab yss of perplexit y; and the only benefit to be derived from such researches is the conviction of their absurdity .\" Yet man, though ignorant of the constitution of the dust on which he treads, has ventured, and still ventures, to speculate on the nature of God, and to define dogma tically in creeds the subject least within the compass of his faculties; and even to hate and persecute those who will not accept his views as true. But though a knowledge of the Divine Essence is impossibl e, the conceptions formed respecting it are interesting, as indications of intel lectual develop ment. The history of religion is the histor y of the human mind; and the conception formed by it of Deit y is always in exact relation to its moral and intell ectual attainments. The one is the index and the measure of the other. The negative notion of God, w hich consists in abstracting the inferior and finite, is, according to Philo, the only way in which it is possible for m an worthil y to apprehend the nature of God. A fter exhausting the varieti es of symbolism, we contrast the Divine Greatness with human littleness, and emplo y expressions apparentl y affirmative, such as \"Infinite,\" \"Almighty,\" \"All-wise,\" \" Omnipotent,\" \"Eternal,\" and the like; which in realit y amount only to deny ing, in regard to God, those limits which con-fine the faculties of man; and thus we remain content with a nam e which is a mere conventional sign and confession of our ignorance. The Hebrew יהוה and the Greek To ON expressed abstract existence, without outward manifestation or develop ment. Of the same nature are the definitions, \"God is a sphere whose centre is every where, and who se circu mference nowhere;\" \"Go d is He w ho sees all, Himself unseen:\" and finally, that of Proclus and Hegel – \"the Το μη ον – that which has no outward and po sitive existence.\" Most of the so-called ideas or definitions of the \"Absolute\" are onl y a collection of negations; from which, as they affirm nothing, nothing is learned. God was first recognized in the heavenl y bodies and in the elements. When man's consciousness of his own intellec tuality was matur ed, and he became convinced that the internal faculty of thought was someth ing more subtle than even the most subtle elements, he transferred that new conception to the object of his w orship, and deified a ment al principle instead of a phy sical one. He in ever y case makes God after his own image ; for do what we will, the highest efforts of human thought can conceive nothing higher than the suprema cy of intelle ct; and so he ever conies back to some familiar type of exalted humanity. He at first deifies nature, and afterward himself. The eternal aspiration of the religious sentim ent in man is to become united with God. In his earliest developm ent, the wish and its fulfill ment were simultan eous, through unquestioning belief. In proportion as the conception of Deit y was exalted, the notion of Page 469 of 621"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike His terrestrial presence or proxi mity was abandoned; and the difficult y of comprehend ing the Divine Governmen t, together with the glaring superstitious evils arising out of its misinterpretation, endangered the belief in it altogether. Even the lights of Heaven, which, as \"bright potentat es of the sk y,\" were former ly the vigilant directors of the econo my of earth, now shine dim and distant, and Uriel no more descends upon a sunbeam. But the real change has been in the progressive ascent of man's own faculties, and not in the Divine Nature; as the Stars are no more distant now than when the y were suppo sed to rest on the shoulders of Atlas. And ye t a little sense of disappoint ment and hum iliation attended the first awakening of the soul, when reason, looking upward toward the Deity, was impressed with a dizzy sense of having fallen. But hope revives in despondency ; and every nation that ever advanced beyond the most elementary conceptions, felt the necessit y of an attem pt to fill the chasm, real or imag inary, separating man from God. To do this was the great task of poetry , philosoph y, and religion. Hence the personificat ions of God's attributes, develop ments, and manifest ations, as \"Powers,\" \"Intelligences,\" \"Angels,\" \"Emana tions;\" through which and the oracular faculty in himself, man could place himself in com munion with God. The various ranks and orders of m ythical beings im agined by Persians, Indians, Egy ptians, or Etrurians, to preside over the various depart ments of nature, had each his share in a scheme to bring man into closer approxi mation to the Deit y; they eventuall y gave way only before an analogous though less picturesque symbolism; and the Deities and Dæmons of Greece and Rome were perpetuated with only a change of nam es, when their offices were transferred to Saints and Marty rs. The atte mpts by which reason had sometimes endeavored to span the unknown by a bridge of metaph ysics, such as the idealisti c systems of Zoroaster, Pythagoras, or Plato, were onl y a more refined form of the poetical illusions which satisfied the vulgar; and man still looked back with longing to the lost golden age, when his ancestors communed face to face with the Gods; and hoped that, by propitiating Heaven, he might accelera te the renewal of it in the islands of the Far West, under the sceptre of Krono s, or in a centraliz ation of politica l power at Jerusalem. His eager hope overcame even the terrors of the grave; for the Divine power was as infinite as human expectat ion, and the Egyptian, duly ensepulchred in the Lybian Catacombs, was supposed to be alread y on his way to the Fortunate Abodes under the guidance of Hermes, there to obtain a perfect association and reunion with his God. Remembering what we have already said elsewhere in regard to the old ideas concerning the Deity, and repeating it as little as possible, let us once more put ourselves in communion with the Ancient poetic and philosophic mind, and endeavor to learn of it what it thought, and how it solved the great problems that have ever tortured the human intellect. The division of the First and Suprem e Cause into two parts, one Active and the other Passive, the Universe Agent and Patient, or the herm aphrodit ic God-World, is one of the most ancient and widespread dogmas of philosophy or natural theolog y. Almost every ancient people gave it a place in their worship, their mysteries, and their ceremon ies. Ocellus Lucanus, who seems to have lived shortly after Pythagoras opened his School in Italy, five or six hundred y ears before our era, and in the time of Solon, Thales, and the Page 470 of 621"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike other Sages w ho had studied in the Schools of Eg ypt, not onl y recognizes the eternit y of the Universe, and its divine character as an unproduced and indestructibl e being, but also the distinction of Active and Passive causes in what he ter ms the Grand Whole, or the single hermaphrod itic Being that co mprehends all existences, as well causes as effects; and which is a system regularl y ordered, perfect and compl ete, of all Natures. He well apprehended the dividing- line that separates existence eternall y the same, from that which eternally changes; the nature of celestia l from that of terrestria l bodies, that of causes from that of effects, that which is from that which only BECOMES, – a distinction that naturall y struck every thinking man. We shall not quote his language at full length. The heavenl y bodies, he thought, are first and most noble; they move of themse lves, and ever revolve, without change of form or essence. Fire, water, earth, and air change incessantl y and continual ly, not place, but form. Then, as in the Universe there are generation and cause of generation, – as generation is where there are change and displacem ent of parts, and cause where there is stabilit y of nature, evidentl y it belongs to what is the cause of generation, to move and to act, and to the recipient, to be mad e and moved. In his view, ever ything above the Moon was the habitation of the gods; all below, that of Nature and discord; this operates dissolution of things made; that , production of those that are being m ade. As the world is unproduced and indestructib le, as it had no beginning, and will have no end, necessaril y the principle that operates generation in another than itself, and that which operates it in itself, have co- existed. The former is all above the moon, and especiall y the sun: the latter is the sublunary world. Of these two parts, one active, the other passive – one divine and alwa ys the same, the other mortal and ever changing, all that we call the \"world\" or \"universe\" is composed. These accorded with the principles of the Eg yptian philosophy , which held that man and the animals had alwa ys existed together with the world; that they were its effects, eternal like itself. The chief divisions of nature into active and passive causes, its system of generation and destruction, and the concurrence of the two great principles, Heaven and earth, uniting to form all things, will, according to Ocellus, always continue to exist. \"Enough,\" he concludes, \"as to the Universe, the generations and destructions effected in it, the mode in which it now exists, the mode in which it will ever exist, b y the eternal qualities of the two principles, one alway s moving, the other always moved; one alwa ys governing , the other always governed .\" Such is a brief summ ary of the doctrine of this philosopher, whose work is one of the most ancient that has survived to us. The subject on which he treated occupied in his time all men's minds: the poets sang of co smogon ies and theogonies, and the philosophers wrote treatises on the birth of the world and the elements of its composit ion. The cosmogon y of the Hebrew s; attributed to Moses; that of the Phœnicians, ascribed to Sanchoniathon; that of the Greeks, composed by Hesiod; that of the Egyptians, the Atlantes, and the Cretans, preserved by Diodoru s Siculus; the frag ments of the theology of Orpheus, divided among different writers; the books of the Persians, or their Boundehesh; those of the Hind s; the ū traditions of the Chinese and the people of Macassar; the cosmogonic chants which Virgil puts in the mouth of Iopas at Carthage; and those of the old Silenus, the first book of the Page 471 of 621"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Metamorphoses of Ovid; all testify to the antiquit y and universalit y of these fictions as to the origin of the world and its causes. At the head of the causes of nature, Heaven and earth were placed; and the most apparent parts of each, the sun, the moon, the fixed stars and planets, and, above all, the zodiac, among the active causes of generation; and among the passive , the several elements. These causes were not only classed in the progressive order of their energy , Heaven and earth heading the respective lists, but distinct sexes were in some sort assigned to them, and character istics analogous to the mode in which they concur in universal generation. The doctrine of Ocellus was the general doctrine everywhere, it naturall y occurring to all to make the same distinction. The Egyptians did so, in selecting those animals in which they recognized these emblematic qualities, in order to symbolize the double sex of the Universe. Their God KNE PH, out of whose mouth issued the Orphic egg, whence the author of the Cle mentine Recognitions makes a hermaphrodit ic figure to e merge, uniting in itself the two principles whereof Heaven and the earth are forms, and which enter into the organizat ion of all beings which the heavens and the earth engender by their concourse, furnishes another emblem of the double power, active and passive, which the ancients saw in the Universe, and which they symbolized by the egg. Orpheus, who studied in Egypt, borrowed from the theologians of that country the mysterious forms under which the science of nature was veiled, and carried into Greece the symbolic egg, with its division into two parts or causes figured by the her maphrodit ic being that issued from it, and whereof Heaven and earth are composed. The Brahmins of India expressed the same cosmogoni c idea by a statue, representative of the Universe, uniting in itself both sexes. The male sex offered an imag e of the sun, centre of the active principle, and the female sex that of the moon, at the sphere whereof, proceeding downward, the passive portion of nature begins. The Lingam, unto the present day revered in the Indian temples, being but the conjunction of the organs of generation of the two sexes, wa s an emblem of t he same. The Hind s have ever had the greatest ū veneration for this symbol of ever-reproductive nature. The Greeks consecrated the same symbols of universal fruitfulness in their Mysteries; and they were exhibited in the sanctuaries of Eleusis. They appear among the sculptured ornaments of all the Indian temples. Tertullian accuses the Valentinians of having adopted the custom of venerating them; a custom, he says, introduced by Melampus from Egypt into Greece. The Egyptians consecrated the Phallus in the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis, as we learn from Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus; and the latter assures us that these emblems were not consecrated by the Egyptians alone, but by every people. They certain ly were so among the Persians and Assyrians; and the y were regarded everywhere as symbolic of the generative and productive powers of all animated beings. In those earl y ages, the works of Nature and all her agents were sacred like herself. For the union of Nature with herself is a chaste marr iage, of which the union of man and woman was a natural image, and their organs were an expressive emblem of the double energy which manifests itself in Heaven and Earth uniting together to produce all beings. \"The Heavens,\" say s Plutarch, \"seem ed to men to fulfill the functions of father, and the Earth of moth er. The former impregnated the earth with its fertiliz ing rains, and the earth, Page 472 of 621"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike receiving them, became fruitful and brought forth.\" Heaven, which covers and embra ces the earth everywhere, is her potent spouse, uniting himself to her to make her fruitful, without which she would languish in everlasting sterility, buried in the shades of chaos and of night. Their union is their marriage; their productions or parts are their children. The skies are our Father, and Nature the great Mother of us all. This idea was not the dogma of a single sect, but the general opinion of all the Sages. \"Nature was divided,\" says Cicero, '\"into two parts, one active, and the other that submit ted itself to this action, which it received, and which modifi ed it. The former was deemed to be a Force, and the latter the material on which that Force exerted itself.\" Macrobius repeated almost literally the doctrine of Ocellus. Aristotle termed the earth the fruitful mother, environed on all sides by the air. Above it was Heaven, the dwelling- place of the gods and the divine stars, its sub stance ether, or a fire incessantl y moving in circles, divine and incorruptibl e, and subject to no change. Below it, nature, and the elements, imitable and acted on, corruptible and mort al. Synesius said that generations were effected in the portions of the Universe which we inhabit; while the cause of generations resided in the portions above us, whence descend to us the germs of the effects produced here below. Proclus and Simplic ius deemed Heaven the Active Cause and Father, relativel y to the earth. The former says that the World or the Whole is a single Animal ; what is done in it, is done by it; the same World acts , and acts upon itself . He divides it into \"Heaven\" and \"Generation.\" In the former, he says, are placed and arranged the conservative causes of generation, superintended by the Genii and Gods. The Earth, or Rhea, associated ever with Saturn in production, is mother of the effects of which Heaven is Father; the womb or bosom that receives the fertilizing energy of the God that engenders ages. The great work of generation is operated, he says, primarily by the action of the Sun, and secondaril y by that of the Moon, so that the Sun is the primitive source of this energ y, as father and chief of the ma le gods that form his court. He follows the action of the male and fema le principles through all the portions and divisions of nature, attribu ting to the former the origin of stabilit y and identit y, to the latter, that of diversit y and mob ility. Heaven is to the earth, he says, as the male to the female. It is the movem ent of the heavens that, by their revolutions, furnished the semina l incitements and forces, w hose em anations received by the earth, make it fruitful, and cause it to produce animals and plants of every kind. Philo says that Moses recognized this doctrine of two causes, active and passive; but made the former to reside in the Mind or Intellig ence external to matter. The ancient astrologers divided the twelve signs of the Zodiac into six ma le and six femal e, and assigned them to six mal e and six fem ale Great Gods. Heaven and Earth, or Ouranos and Ghê, were among most ancient nations, the first and most ancient Diviniti es. We find them in the Phœnician history of Sanchoniathon, and in the Grecian Genealog y of the Gods given b y Hesiod. Ever ywhere they marry, and by their union produce the later Gods. \"In the beginning,\" says Apollodorus, \"Ouranos or the Heavens was Lord of all the Universe: he took to wife Ghê or the earth, and had by her man y children.\" They were the first Gods of the Cretans, and under other names, of the Armeni ans, as we learn from Berosus, and of Panchaîa, an island South of Arabia, as we learn from Euhemerus.

He called Heaven PA NGENETOR, the Father of all things, most ancient of Beings, beginning and end of all, containing in Himself the incorruptible and un wearying force of Necessity . The same idea obtained in the rude North of Europe. The Scythians made the earth to be the wife of Jupiter; and the Germans adored her under the name of HERTA. The Celts worshipped the Heavens and the Earth, and said that without the former the latter would be sterile, and that their marriage produced all things. The Scandinavians acknowledged BÖR or the Heavens, and gave FURTUR, his son, the Earth as his wife. Olaus Rudbeck adds, that their ancestors were persuaded that Heaven inter married with the Earth, and thus uniting his forces with hers, produced ani mals and plants. This marriage of Heaven and Earth produced the AZES, Genii famous in the theolog y of the North. In the theolog y of the Phrygians and Lydians, the ASII were born of the m arriage of the Suprem e God with the Earth, and Firmi cus informs us that the Phry gians attribut ed to the Earth supremac y over the other elements, and considered her the Great Mother of all things. Virgil sings the impr egnation of the joyous earth, b y the Ether, its spouse, that descends upon its bosom, fertilizing it with rains. Colume lla sings the loves of Nature and her marriage with Heaven annuall y consumm ated at the sweet Spring-ti me. He describes the Spirit of Life, the soul that ani mates the world, fired with the passion of Love, uniting with Nature and itself, itself a part of Nature, and filling its own bo som with new productions. This union of the Universe with itself, this mutu al action of two sexes, he terms \"the great Secrets of Nature,\" the Mysteries of the Union of Heaven with Earth, imaged in the Sacred Mysteries of Atys and Bacchus.\" Varro tells us that the great Divinities adored at Samo thrace were the Heavens and the Earth, considered as First Causes or Primal Gods, and as ma le and female agents, one bearing to the other the relations that the Soul and Principle of Movemen t bear to the body or the matter that receives them. These were the gods revered in the Mysteries of that Island, as they were in the orgies of Phœnicia. Everywhere the sacred bod y of Nature was covered with the veil of allegor y, which concealed it from the profane, and allowed it to be seen onl y by the sage who thought it worthy to be the object of his study and investigation. She showed herself to those onl y who loved her in spirit and in truth, and she abandoned the indifferent and careless to error and to ignorance. \"The Sages of Greece,\" says Pausanias, \"never wrote otherwise than in an enigma tical manner, never naturall y and directl y.\" \"Nature,\" says Sallust the Philosopher, \"should be sung only in a language that imitates the secrecy of her processes and operations. She is herself an enig ma. We see only bodies in movem ent; the forces and springs that move them are hidden from us.\" The poets inspired by the Divinit y, the wisest philosophers, all the theologians, the chiefs of the initiations and Mysteries, even the gods uttering their oracles, have borrowed the figurative language of allegor y. \"The Egyptians,\" says Proclus, \"preferred that mode of teaching, and spoke of the great secrets of Nature, only in mythological enigmas.\" The Gymnosophists of India and the Druids of Gaul lent to science the same enigmatic language, and in the same style wrote the Hierophants of Phœnicia.

Naturall y, therefore, two substances of oppo site natures were imag ined, to each of which the world wa s in turn sub jected, one contribut ing to its felicity and the other to its misfortun e. Light multiplied its enjoyments; Darkness despoiled it of the m: the former was its friend, the latter its enemy. To one all good was attributed; to the other all evil; and thus the words \"Light\" and \"Good\" beca me synonymous, and the words \"Darkness\" and \"Evil.\" It seeming that Good and Evil could not flow from one and the same source, an y more than could Light and Darkness, men naturall y imagin ed two Causes or Principles, of different natures and opposite in their effects, one of which shed Light and Good, and the other Darkness and Evil, on the Universe. This distinction of the two Principles was admitted in all the Theologies, and formed one of the principal bases of all religions. It entered as a primar y elemen t into the sacred fables, the cosmogonies and the Mysteries of antiquit y. \"We are not to suppose,\" sa ys Plutarch, \"that the Principles of the Universe are inanim ate bodies, as Democr itus and Epicurus thought; nor that a matter devoid of qualities is organized and arranged by a single Reason or Providence, Sovereign over all things, as the Stoics held; for it is not pos sible that a single Being, good or evil, is the cause of all, inasmu ch as God can in nowise be the cause of any evil. The harmon y of the Universe is a combina tion of contraries, like the strings of a lyre, or that of a bow, which alternat ely is stretched and relaxed.\" \"The good,\" s ays Euripides, \"is never separated from the Evil. The two must mingle, that all may go well.\" And this opinion as to the two principles, continues Plutarch, \"is that of all antiquit y. From the Theologians and Legislators it passed to the Poets and Philosophers. Its author is unknown; but the opinion itself is established by the tradit ions of the whole human race, and consecrated in the mysteries and sacrifices both of the Greeks and Barbarians, wherein was recognized the dogma of opposing principles in nature, which, by their contrariet y, produce the mixture of good and evil. We must admit two contrar y causes, two oppo sing powers, which lead, one to the right and the other to the left, and thus control our life, as they do the sublunar y world, which is therefore subject to so man y changes and irregulari ties of ever y kind. For if there can be no effect without a cause, and if the Good cannot be the cause of the Evil, it is absolutel y necessary that there should be a cause for the Evil, as there is one for the Good.\" This doctrine, he adds, has been generall y received among most nations, and especiall y by those who have had the greatest reputation for wisdom.

The former has been styled \"God,\" the latter \"Demon.\" The Persians, or Zoroaster, named the former Ormuzd and the latter Ahriman ; of whom they said one was of the nature of Light, the other of that of Darkness. The Egyptians called the former Osiris, and the latter Typhon, his eternal enemy. The Hebrew s, at least after their return from the Persian captivi ty, had their good Deit y, and the Devil, a bad and m alicious Spirit, ever opposing God, and Chief of the Angels of Darkness, as G od was of those of Light. The word \"Satan\" means, in Hebrew, simpl y, \"The Adversary.\" The Chaldæans, Plutarch says, had their good and evil stars. The Greeks had their Jupiter and Pluto, and their Giants and Titans, to whom were assigned the attributes of the Serpent with which Pluto or Serapis was encircled, and the shape whereof was assumed by Typhon, Ahriman, and the Satan of the Hebrews. Every people had someth ing equivalen t to this. The People of Pegu believe in two Principles, one author of Good and the other of Evil, and strive to propitia te the latter, while they think it needless to worship the former, as he is incapable of doing evil. The people of Java, of the Moluccas, of the Gold Coast, the Hottentots, the people of Teneriffe and Madagascar, and the Savage Tribes of America, all worship and strive to avert the anger and propitiat e the good-will of the Evil Spirit. But among the Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldæans, Persians, and As syrians, the doctrine of the two Principles formed a compl ete and regularl y arranged theologica l system. It was the basis of the religion of the Magi and of Eg ypt. The author of an ancient work, attribut ed to Origen, says that Pythagoras learned from Zarastha, a Magus at Bab ylon (the same, perhaps, as Zerdusht or Zoroaster), that there are two principles of all things, whereof one is the father and the other the mother ; the former, Light, and the latter, Darkness. Pythagoras thought that the Dependencies on Light were warmth, dryness, lightness, swiftness; and those on Darknes s, cold, wet, weight, and slowne ss; and that the world derived its existence from these two principles, as from the male and the female. According to Porphy ry, he conceived two opposing powers, one good, which he termed Unity, the Light, Right, the Equal, the Stable, the Straight; the other evil, which he ter med Binary, Darknes s, the Left, the Unequal, the Unstable, the Crooked. These ideas he received from the Orientals, for he dwelt twelve years at Babylon, studying with the Magi. Varro sa ys he recognized two Principles of all things, – the Finite and the Infinite, Good and Evil, Life and Death, Da y and Night. White he thought was of the nature of the Good Principle, and Black of that of the Evil; that Light and Darkne ss, Heat and Cold, the Dry and the Wet, mingled in equal proportions; that Summer was the triumph of heat, and Winter of cold; that their equal combin ation produced Spring and Autumn, the former producing verdure and favorable to health, and the latter, deteriorating everything, giving birth to maladies. He applied the same idea to the rising and setting of the sun; and, like the Magi, held that God or O rmuzd in the body resembled light, and in the soul, truth. Aristotle, like Plato, admitted a principle of Evil, resident in matter and in its eternal imperfection. Page 476 of 621"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Persians said that Ormuzd, born of the pure Light, and Ahriman, born of darkness, were ever at war. Ormuzd produced six Gods, Beneficence, Truth, Good O rder, Wisdom, Riches, and Virtuous Joy . These were so man y emanations from the Good P rinciple, so many blessings bestowed by it on men. Ahriman, in his turn, produced six Devs, opponents of the six eman ations from Ormuzd. Then Ormuzd made himself three times as great as before, ascended as far above the sun as the sun is above the earth, and adorned the heavens with stars, of which he m ade Sirius the sentinel or advance- guard: that he then created twenty -four other Deities, and placed them in an egg, where Ahriman also placed twenty-four others, created by him, who broke the egg, and so interm ingled Good and Evil. Theopo mpus adds that, according to the Magi, for two terms of three thousand years, each of the two Principles is to be b y turns victor and the other vanquished; then for three thousand more for each they are to contend with each other, each destroying reciprocal ly the works of the other; after which Ahriman is to perish, and men, wearing transparent bodies, to enjoy unutterabl e happiness. The twelve great Deities of the Persians, the six Amshaspands and six Devs, marshall ed, the former under the banner of Light, and the latter under that of Darkness, are the twelve Zodiaca l Signs or M onths; the six supreme signs, or those of Light, or of Spring and Summer, commencing with Aries, and the six inferior, of Darknes s, or of Autumn and Winter, commencing with Libra. Li mited Time, as contradistinguished from Time without limits, or Eternit y, is Time created and measured by the celesti al revolutions. It is comprehended in a period divided into twelve parts, each subdivided into a thousand parts, which the Persians term ed years. Thus the circle annuall y traversed b y the Sun wa s divided into 12,000 parts, or each sign into 3,000: and thus, each year, the Principle of Light and Good triumph ed for 3,000 y ears, that of Evil and Darkness for 3,000, and the y mutually destroyed each other's labors for 6,000, or 3,000 for each: so that the Zodiac was equall y divided between them. And accordingl y Ocellus Lucanus, the Disciple of Pythagoras, held that the principal cause of all sublunar y effects resided in the Zodiac, and that from it flowed the good or bad influences of the planets that revolved therein. The twenty -four good and twenty -four evil Deities, enclosed in the Egg, are the fort y-eight constella tions of the ancient sphere, equall y divided between the realms of Light and Darkness, on the concavit y of the celesti al sphere which was apportioned among them; and which, enclosing the world and planets, was the m ystic and sacred egg of the Magi, the Indians, and the Eg yptians, – the egg that issued from the mouth of the God K neph, that figured as the Orphic Egg in the Mysteries of Greece, that issued from the God Chumong of the Coresians, and from the Egyptian Osiris and the God Phanes of the Modern Orphics, Principle of Light, – the egg crushed by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, and from which the world emerged ; that placed by the Greeks at the feet of Bacchus the bull-horned God, and from which Aristophanes mak es Love em erge, who with Night organizes Chaos. Thus the Balance, the Scorpion, the Serpent of Ophiucus, and the Dragon of the Hesperides beca me malevo lent Signs and Evil Genii; and entire nature was divided between the two principles, and between the agents or partial causes subordinate to them. Hence Michael and his Archangels, and Satan and his fallen compeers. Hence the wars of Jupiter and the Giants, in which the God s of Olympus fought on the side of the Light- God, against the dark progeny of earth and Chaos; a war w hich Proclus regarded as symbolizing Page 477 of 621"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the resistance opposed by dark and chaotic matter to the active and beneficent force which gives it organization ; an idea which in part appears in the old theor y of two Principles, one innate in the active and lum inous substance of Heaven, and the other in the inert and dark substance of matt er that resists the order and the good that Heaven com municates to it. Osiris conquers T yphon, and Ormuzd, Ahriman, when, at the Vernal Equinox, the creativ e action of Heaven and its de miourgic energy is most strongly manifested. Then the principle of Light and Good overco mes that of Darknes s and Evil, and the world rejoices, redeemed from cold and wintr y darkness by the beneficent Sign into which the Sun then enters triumphant and rejoicing, after his resurrection. From the doctrine of the two Principles, Active and Passive, grew that of the Universe, animated by a Principle of Eternal Life, and by a Universal Soul, from which every isolated and temporar y being received at its birth an emanation, which, at the death of such being, returned to its source. The life of matter as much belonged to nature as did ma tter itself; and as life is manifest ed by movement, the sources of life must needs seem to be placed in those luminous and eternal bodies, and above all in the Heaven in which the y revolve, and which whirls them along with itself in that rapid course that is swifter than all other movem ent. And fire and heat have so great an analog y with life, that cold, like absence of move ment, seemed the distinctive characteristi c of death. Accordingl y, the vital fire that blazes in the Sun and produces the heat that vivifies everything, was regarded as the principle of organizat ion and life of all sublunary beings. According to this doctrine, the Universe is not to be regarded, in its creative and eternal action, merely as an imm ense machine, moved by powerful springs and forced into a continual movem ent, which, emanat ing from the circu mference, extends to the centre, acts and re-acts in every possible direction, and re-produces in succession all the varied forms which matter receives. So to regard it would be to recognize a cold and purel y mechan ical action, the energy of which could never produce life. On the contrary , it was thought, the Universe should be dee med an immense Being, alwa ys living, always moved and alwa ys moving in an eternal activity inherent in itself, and which, subordinate to no foreign cause, is comm unicated to all its parts, connects them together, and makes of the world of things a comp lete and perfect whole. The order and harmon y which reign therein seem to belong to and be a part of it, and the design of the various plans of construction of organized beings would seem to be graven in its Supreme Intelligence, source of all the other Intelligenc es which it communicates together with life to man. Nothing existing out of it, it must be regarded as the principle and term of all things. Chæremon had no reason for sa ying that the Ancient Egyptians, inventors of the sacred fables, and adorers of the Sun and the other luminaries, saw in the Universe onl y a machine, without life and without intell igence, either in its whole or in its parts; and that their cosmogon y was a pure Epicureanism , which required onl y matter and mov ement to organize its world and govern it. Such an opinion would necessaril y exclude all religious worship. Wherever we suppo se a worship, there we must suppose intellig ent Deities who receive it, and are sensible to the hom age of their adorers; and no other people were so religious as the Egyptians.

It was to them, in some sort, like the Ocean, whence the springs, brooks, and rivers have risen by evaporation, and to the bosom whereof the y return by a longer or shorter course, and after a longer or shorter separation from the immense mass of its waters. The ma chine of the Universe was, in their view, like that of man, moved by a Principle of Life which kept it in eternal activity, and circulat ed in all its parts. The Universe was a living and animated being, like man and the other animals; or rather they were so only because the Universe was es sentially so, and for a few moments communicated to each an infinitel y minute portion of its eternal life, breathed by it into the inert and gross matt er of sublunary bodies. That withdrawn, man or the animal died; and the Universe alone, living and circula ting around the wrecks of their bodies, b y its eternal movement, organized and anim ated new bodies, returning to them the eternal fire and subtle substance which vivifies itself, and which, incorporated in its immense mass, was its universal soul. These were the ancient ideas as to this Great GOD, Father of all the gods, or of the World; of this BEING, Principle of all things, and of which nothing other than itself is Principle, – the Universal cause that was termed God. Soul of the Universe, eternal like it, immense like it, supremel y active and potent in its varied operations, penetrating all parts of this vast body, impressing a regular and symmetrical movement on the spheres, mak ing the elements instinct with activi ty and order, mingling with ever ything, organizing everything, vivifying and preserving everything, – this was the UNIVERSE-GO D which the ancients adored as Supreme Cause and God of Gods. Anchises, in the Æneid, taught Æneas this doctrine of Pythagoras, learned by him from his Masters, the Egyptians, in regard to the Soul and Intelligenc e of the Universe, from which our souls and intelligen ces, as well as our life and that of the ani mals, emanate, Heaven, Earth, the Sea, the Moon and the Stars, he said, are moved by a principle of internal life which perpetuates their existence; a great intelligen t soul, that penetrates every part of the vast body of the Universe, and, mingling with ever ything, agitates it by an eternal movement. It is the source of life in all living things. The force which animates all, emanates from the eternal fire that burns in Heaven. In the Georgics, Virgil repeats the same doctrine; and that, at the death of ever y animal, the life that animated it, part of the universal life, returns to its Principle and to the source of life that circula tes in the sphere of the Stars. Servius mak es God the active Cause that organizes the elements into bodies, the vivifying breath or spirit, that, spreading through matter or the elements, produces and engenders all things. The ele ments compose the substance of our bodies: God composes the souls that vivify these bodies. From it come the instincts of anima ls, from it their life, he says: and when the y die, that life returns to and re-enters into the Universal Soul, and their bodies into Universal Matter. Timæus of Locria and Plato his Com mentator wrote of the Soul of the World, developing the doctrine of Pythagoras, who thought, says Cicero, that God is the Universal Soul, Page 479 of 621"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike resident everywhere in nature, and of which our Souls are but eman ations. \" God is one ,\" says Pythagoras, as cited by Justin Mart yr: \"He is not, as some think, without the world, but within it, and entire in its entiret y. He sees all that becomes , forms all immortal beings, is the author of their powers and perform ances, the origin of all things, the Light of Heaven, the Father , the Intellig ence , the Soul of all beings, the Mover of all spheres.\" God, in the view of P ythagoras, was ONE, a single substance, whose continuous parts extended through all the Universe, without separation, difference, or inequali ty, like the soul in the human body. He denied the doctrine of the spiritualists, who had severed the Divinity from the Universe, mak ing Him exist apart from the Universe, which thus beca me no more than a material work, on which acted the Abstract Cause, a God, isolated from it. The Ancient Theolog y did not so separate God from the Universe. This Eusebius attests, in saying that but a small number of wise men, like Moses, had sought for God or the Cause of all, outside of that ALL; while the Philosophers of Egy pt and Phœnicia, real authors of all the old Cosmogonies, had placed the Supreme Cause in the Universe itself, and in its parts, so that, in their view, the world and all its parts are in God. The World or Universe was thus comp ared to man: the Principle of Life that moves it, to that which mov es man; the Soul of the World to that of man. Therefore Pythagoras called man a microcosm , or little world, as possessing in min iature all the qualities found on a great scale in the Universe; by his reason and intelligen ce partaking of the Divine Nature: and by his facult y of changing aliments into other substances, of growing, and re- producing himself, partaking of elem entary Nature. Thus he made the Universe a great intelligent Being, like man – an im mense Deity, having in itself, what man has in himself, movement, life, and intellig ence, and besides, a perpetuit y of existence, which man has not; and, as having in itself perpetuit y of mov ement and life, therefore the Supreme Cause of all. Everywhere extended, this Universal Soul does not, in the view of P ythagoras, act everywhere equally nor in the same manner. The highest portion of the Universe, being as it were its head, seemed to him its principal seat, and there was the guiding power of the rest of the world. In the seven concentric spheres is resident an eternal order, fruit of the intelligence, the Universal Soul that moves, by a constant and regular progression, the immortal bodies that form the harmon ious system of the heavens. Manilius says: \"I sing the invisible and potent Soul of Nature; that Divine Substance which, everywhere inherent in Heaven, Earth, and the Waters of the Ocean, forms the bond that holds together and makes one all the parts of the vast body of the Universe. It, balancing all Forces, and harmoniousl y arranging the varied relations of the many members of the world, maintains in it the life and regular movem ent that agitate it, as a result of the action of the living breath or single spirit that dwells in all its parts, circula tes in all the channels of universal nature, flashes with rapidit y to all its points, and gives to animated bodies the configurations appropriate to the organizat ion of each... This eternal Law, this Divine Force, that maintains the harmon y of the world, makes use of the Celestia l Signs to organize and guide the animated creatures that breathe upon the earth; and gives to each of them the character and habits most appropriate. By the action of this Force Heaven rules the condition of the Earth and of its fields cultivated by the Page 480 of 621"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike husbandman : it gives us or takes from us vegetation and harvests: it makes the great ocean overpass its li mits at the flow, and retire within them again at the ebbing, of the tide.\" Thus it is no longer by means of a poetic fiction only that the heavens and the earth become animated and personified, and are deemed living existences, from which other existences proceed. For now they live, with their own life, a life eternal like their bodies, each gifted with a life and perhaps a soul, like those of man, a portion of the universal life and universal soul; and the other bodies that they form, and which they contain in their bosoms, live only through them and with their life, as the embr yo lives in the bosom of its mother, in consequence and by means of the life communicated to it, and which the moth er ever maintains by the active power of her own life. Such is the universal life of the world, reproduced in all the beings which its superior portion creates in its inferior portion, that is as it were the matrix of the world, or of the beings that the heavens engender in its bosom, \"The soul of the world,\" sa ys Macrobius, \"is nature itself\" [as the soul of m an is man himself], \"always acting through the celesti al spheres which .it moves, and which but follow the irresistible impulse it impr esses on the m. The heavens, the sun, great seat of generative power, the signs, the stars, and the planets act only with the activi ty of the soul of the Universe. From that soul, through the m, come all the variations and changes of sublunar y nature, of which the heavens and celestial bodies are but the secondar y causes. The zodiac, with its signs, is an existence, immortal and divine, organized by the universal soul, and producing, or gathering in itself, all the varied emanations of the different powers that make up the nature of the Divinit y.\" This doctrine, that gave to the heavens and the spheres living souls, each a portion of the universal soul, was of extrem e antiquit y. It was held b y the old Sabæans. It was taught by Timæus, Plato, Speusippus, Iamb lichus, Macrobius, Marcus Aurelius, and Py thagoras. When once men had assigned a soul to the Universe, containing in itself the plenitude of the animal life of particul ar beings, and even of the stars, they soon supposed that soul to be essentiall y intellig ent, and the source of intel ligence of all intellig ent beings. Then the Universe beca me to them not onl y animated but intelligen t, and of that intel ligence the different parts of nature partook. Each soul was the vehicle, and, as it were, the envelope of the intellig ence that attach ed itself to it, and could repose nowhere else. Without a soul there could be no intellig ence; and as there was a universal soul, source of all souls, the universal soul was gifted with a universal intellig ence, source of all particular intelligenc es. So the soul of the world contained in itself the intel ligence of the world. All the agents of nature into which the universal soul entered, received also a portion of its intell igence, and the Universe, in its totality and in its parts, wa s filled with intellig ences, that might be regarded as so man y emanations from the sovereign and universal intelligence. Wherever the divine soul acted as a cause, there also was intell igence; and thus Heaven, the stars, the elements, and all parts of the Universe, became the seats of so man y divine intelligences. Every minutest portion of the great soul beca me a partial intelligence, and the more it was disengaged from gross matt er, the more active and intellig ent it was. A nd all the old adorers of nature, the theologians, astrologers, and poets, and the most distinguished philosophers, supposed that the stars w ere so many animated and intellig ent beings, or eternal bodies, active causes of effects here below, whom a principle of life animated, and Page 481 of 621"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike whom an intelligenc e directed, which was but an eman ation from, and a portion of, the universal life and intell igence of the world. The Universe itself was regarded as a supreme ly intelligent being. Such was the doctrine of Timæus of Locria. The soul of man was part of the intellig ent soul of the Universe, and therefore itself intelligent. His opinion was that of man y other philosophers. Cleanthes, a disciple of ZENO, regarded the Universe as God, O r as the unproduced and universal cause of all effects produced. He ascribed a soul and intellig ence to universal nature, and to this intelligen t soul, in his view, divinity belonged. From it the intell igence of man was an emanation, and shared its divinity. Chrysippus, the most subtle of the Stoics, placed in the universal reason that forms the soul and intellig ence of nature, that divine force or essence of the Divinit y which he assigned to the world mov ed by the universal soul that pervades its every part. An interlocutor in Cicero's work, De Natura Deo rum , formal ly argues that the Universe is necessaril y intelligent and wise, because man, an infinit ely small portion of it, is so. Cicero makes the same argumen t in his oration for Milo. The ph ysicists came to the same conclusion as the philosophers. They supposed that movement essentiall y belonged to the soul, and the direction of regular and ordered move ments to the intell igence. And, as both movement and order exist in the Universe, therefore, they held, there must be in it a soul and an intelligen ce that role it, and are not to be distinguished from itself; because the idea of the Universe is but the aggregate of all the particular ideas of all things that exist. The argumen t was, that the Heavens, and the Stars which mak e part of them, are animated , because they possess a portion of the Universal Soul: they are intelligen t beings, because that Universal Soul, part whereof they possess, is supremel y intellig ent; and the y share Divinity with Universal Nature, because Divinit y resides in the Universal Soul and Intelligence which move and rule the world, and of each of which the y hold a share. B y this process of logic, the interlocutor in Cicero assigned Divinit y to the Stars, as anim ated beings gifted with sensibility and intell igence, and composed of the noblest and purest portions of the ethereal substance, unmixed with matter of an alien nature, and essentiall y containing light and heat. Hence he concluded them to be so man y gods, of an intell igence superior to that of other existences, corresponding to the lofty height in which they moved with such perfect regularit y and adm irable harmon y, with a move ment spontaneous and free. Hence he m ade them \"Gods,\" active, eternal, and intelligen t \"Causes\"; and peopled the realm of Heaven with a host of Eternal Intelligences, celestial Genii or Angels, sharing the universal Divinit y, and associated with it in the administration of the Universe, and the dominion exercised over sublunar y nature and man. We make the mot ive-force of the planets to be a me chanical law, which we explain by the combination of two forces, the centripeta l and centrifuga l, whose origin we cannot demonstr ate, but who se force we can calculate. The ancients regarded the m as moved by an intelligen t force that had its origin in the first and universal Intelligen ce. Is it so certain, after all, that we are an y nearer the truth than the y were; or that we know w hat our \"centripe tal and centrifugal forces\" mean ; for what is a force ? With us, the entire Deity acts upon and moves each planet, as He doe s the sap that circulates in the litt le blade of grass, and in the particl es of blood in the tiny veins of the invisible rotifer. With the Ancients, the Page 482 of 621"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Deity of each Star was but a portion of the Universal God, the Soul of Nature. Each Star and Planet, with them, was moved of itself , and directed by its own special intelligence. And this opinion of Achilles Tatius, Diodoru s, Chrysippus, Aristotle, Plato, Heraclides of Pontus, Theophrastus, Simplic ius, Macrobius, and Proclus, that in each Star there is an immortal Soul and Intelligence, part of the Universal Soul and Intelligenc e of the Whole, – this opinion of Orpheus, Plotinus, and the Stoics, was in realit y, that of man y Christian philosophers. For Origen held the same opinion; and Augustin held that every visible thing in the world was s uperintended by an Angelic Power: and Cosma, the Monk, believed that every Star was under the guidance of an Angel; and the author of the Octateuch, written in the time of the Emperor Justin, says that they are moved by the impulse communicated to them by Angels stationed above the firmament. Whether the stars were anim ated beings, was a question that Christian antiquit y did not decide. Many of the Christian doctors believed they were. Saint Augustin hesitates, Saint Jerome doubts, if Solomon did not assign souls to the Stars. Saint Ambrose does not doubt the y have souls; and Pamphilus says that many of the Church believe they are reasonable beings, while many think otherwise, but that neither one nor the other opinion is heretica l. Thus the Ancient Thought, earnest and sincere, wrought out the idea of a Soul inherent in the Universe and in its several parts. The next step was to separate that Soul from the Universe, and give to it an external and independent existence and personalit y; still omnipresent, in every inch of space and in every particle of matter, and yet not a part of Nature, but its Cause and its Creator. This is the middle ground between the two doctrines, of Pantheis m (or that all is God, and God is in all and is all), on the one side, and Atheism (or that all is nature, and there is no other God), on the other; which doctrines, after all, when reduced to their simplest terms, seem to be the same. We compla cently congratulat e ourselves on our recognition of a personal God, as being the conception most suited to human sympathies, and exe mpt from the mystifications of Pantheis m. But the Divinit y remains still a mystery, notwithstanding all the devices which symbolism, either from the organic or inorganic creation, can supply ; and personificat ion is itself a symbol, liable to misapprehension as much as, if not more so than, any other, since it is apt to degenerate into a mere reflection of our own infir mities; and hence an y affirmative idea or conception that we can, in our own minds, picture of the Deity, must needs be infinitel y inadequate. The spirit of the Vedas (or sacred Indian Books, of great antiqui ty), as understood b y their earliest as well as most recent expositors, is decidedl y a pantheisti c monoth eism – one God, and He all in all; the man y divinities, numerous as the pra yers ad-dressed to them, being resolvable into the titles and attributes of a few, and ultimately into THE ONE. The machinery of personification was understood to have been unconsciously assumed as a mere expedient to supply the deficien cies of language; and the Mimansa justly considered itself as only interpret ing the true meaning of the Mantras, when it proclaim ed that, in the beginning, \"Nothing was but Mind, the Creative Thought of Him which existed alone from the beginning, and breathed without afflation.\" The idea suggested in the Mantras is dogmatically asserted and developed in the Upanischadas. The Vedanta philosoph y, assuming the mystery of the \"ONE IN M ANY\" as the fundament al article of faith, maintained not only the Divine Unit y, but the identi ty of matter and spirit. The unity which Page 483 of 621"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike it advocates is that of mind. Mind is the Universal Element, the One God, the Great Soul, Mahaat ma. He is the ma terial as well as efficient cause, and the world is a texture of which he is both the web and the weaver. He is the Macrocosmos, the universal organism called Pooroosha, of which Fire, Air, and Sun are onl y the chief members. His head is light, his eyes the sun and moon, his breath the wind, his voice the opened Vedas. All proceeds from Brahm, like the web from the spider and the grass from the earth. Yet it is onl y the impossibi lity of expressing in language the origination of matt er from spirit, which gives to Hindu philosophy the appearance of materialism. Formless Himself, the Deity is present in all forms. His glory is displa yed in the Universe as the image of the sun in water, which is, yet is not, the luminar y itself. All mat ernal agency and appearance, the subjective world, are to a great extent phantas ms, the notional representations of ignorance. They occupy , however, a middl e ground between reality and non-realit y; they are unreal, because nothing exists but Brahm; yet in some degree real, inasmu ch as they constitute an outward man ifestation of him. They are a self- induced h ypostasis of the Deity, under which He presents to Himself the whole of anima te and inanim ate Nature, the actuality of the moment, the diversified appearances which successivel y invest the one Pantheistic Spirit. The great aim of reason is to generaliz e; to discover unit y in multiplicity, order in apparent confusion; to separate from the accident al and the transitor y, the stable and universal. In the contem plation of Nature, and the vague, but al most intuitive perception of a general uniform ity of plan among endless varieties of operation and form, arise those solemn and reverentia l feelings, which, if accomp anied by intellec tual activity, may eventuall y ripen into philosophy . Consciousness of self and of personal identity is co-existent with our existence. We cannot conceive of menta l existence without it. It is not the work of reflection nor of logic, nor the result of observation, experim ent, and experience. It is a gift from God, like instinct ; and that consciousness of a thinking soul which is reall y the person that we are, and other than our bod y, is the best and most solid proof of the soul's existence. We have the same consciousness of a Power on which we are dependent; which we can define and form an idea or picture of, as littl e as we can of the soul, and y et which we feel , and therefore know , exists. True and correct ideas of that Power, of the Ab solute Existence from which all proceeds, we cannot trace; if by true and correct we mean adequate ideas; for of s uch we are not, with our li mited faculties, capable. And ideas of His nature, so far correct as we are capable of entertain ing, can only be attain ed either by direct inspiration or by the investigat ions of philosophy . The idea of the universal preceded the recognition of any system for its explanation. It was felt rather than understood; and it was long before the grand conception on which all philosoph y rests received through deliberat e investigat ion that analytical develop ment which might properly entitle it to the name. The sentim ent, when first observed by the self- conscious m ind, was, say s Plato, \"a Divine gift, co mmunicated to mank ind by some Prometh eus, or by those ancients who lived nearer to the gods than our degenerate selves.\" The mind deduced from its first experiences the notion of a general Cause or Antecedent, to which it shortly gave a name and personified it. This was the statement of a theorem, Page 484 of 621"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike obscure in proportion to its generalit y. It explained all things but itself . It was a true cause, but an incomprehensible one. Ages had to pass before the nature of the theore m could be rightly appreciat ed, and before men, acknowledging the First Cause to be an object of faith rather than science, were contented to confine their researches to those nearer relations of existence and succession, which are really within the reach of their faculties. At first, and for a long tim e, the intellec t deserted the real for a hastily-formed ideal world, and the imagination usurped the place of reason, in attempting to put a construction on the most general and inadequate of conceptions, by transmu ting its symbols into realities, and by substantiali zing it under a thousand arbitrar y forms. In poetr y, the idea of Divine unity became, as in Nature, obscured by a multifarious symbolism; and the notionali ties of transcendenta l philosoph y reposed on views of nature scarcely more profound than those of the earliest symbolists. Yet the idea of unity was rather obscured than extinguished; and Xenophanes appeared as an enem y of Homer, only because he more emphat ically insisted on the monotheist ic element, which, in poetry, has been compara tively overlooked. The first philosophy reasserted the unit y which poetr y had lost; but being unequal to investigate its nature, it again resigned it to the world of approxi mate sensations, and beca me bewildered in materialism, considering the conceptiona l whole or First Element as some refinem ent of matter, unchangeable in its essence, though sub ject to mutations of qualit y and form in an eternal succession of seeming decay and regeneration ; compar ing it to water, air, or fire, as each endeavored to refine on the doctrine of his predecessor, or was influenced by a different class of theologic al traditions. In the philosophical systems, the Divine Activit y, divided by the poets and by popular belief among a race of personifications, in whom the idea of descent replaced that of cause, or of pantheisti c evolution, was restored, without subdivision or reservation, to nature as a whole; at first as a mech anical force or life ; afterward as an all-pervading soul or inherent thought ; and lastl y as an external directing Intellig ence . The Ionian revival of pantheism was materialistic. The Moving Force was inseparable from a material element, a subtle yet visible ingredient. Under the form of air or fire , the principle of life was associated with the most obvious mater ial machin ery of nature. Everything, it was said, is alive and full of gods. The wonders of the volcano, the magne t, the ebb and flow of the tide, were vital indicat ions, the breathing or moving of the Great World- Animal. The impercep tible. ether of Anaximenes had no positive quality beyond the atmospheric air with which it was easil y confused: and even the \"Infinite\" of Anaximand er, though free of the conditions of qualit y or quantit y, was only an ideal chaos, relieved of its coarseness b y negations. It was the illimitable storehouse or Pleroma, out of which is evolved the endless circle of phenom enal change. A moving Force was recognized in, but not clearly distinguished from , the material. Space, Ti me, Figure, and Number, and other common forms or properties, which exist only as attributes , were treated as substances , or at least as making a substantial connection between the objects to which the y belong: and all the conditions of mater ial existence were supposed to have been evolved out of the Pythagorean Monad. Page 485 of 621"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Eleatic philosophers treated conceptions not onl y as entiti es, but as the only entities, alone possessing the stabilit y and certaint y and realit y vainly sought among phenomena. The only reality was Thought. \"All real existence,\" they said, \"is ment al existence ; non- existence, being inconceivab le, is therefore impossible; existence fills up the whole range of thought, and is inseparable from its exercise; thought and its object are one.\" Xenophanes used amb iguous language, applicable to the material as well as to the men tal, and exclusivel y appropriate to neither. In other words, he availed himself of material imagery to illustrate an indefinite meaning. In announcing the universal being, he appealed to the heavens as the visible manifestation, calling it spherical , a term borrowed from the material world. He said that God was neither moved nor unmov ed, limited nor unlim ited. He did not even atte mpt to express clearly what cannot be conceived clearly; admitting, says Simpli cius, that such speculations were above physics. Parmenides employed similar expedients, comparing his metaph ysical Deity to a sphere, or to heat, an aggregate or a continuit y, and so involuntaril y withdrawing its nominal attributes. The Atomic school, dividing the All into Matter and Force, deemed matter unchangeable in its ultim ate constitution, though infinitel y variable in its resultant forms. They made all variety proceed from the varied combin ations of atoms; but they required no mover nor director of the atoms external to themselves; no universal Reason; but a Mechanical Eternal Necessity , like that of the Poets. Still it is doubtful whether there ever was a ti me when reason could be said to be entirel y asleep, a stranger to its own existence, notwithstanding this apparent materialism. The earliest contemplation of the external world, which brings it into an imagined association with ourselves, assigns, either to its whole or its parts, the sensation and volition which belong to our own s ouls. Anaxagoras adm itted the existence of ultimate elementary particles, as Empedoc les did, from the comb inations whereof all material phenomena resulted. But he asserted the Moving Force to be Mind; and yet, though he clearl y saw the i mpossibili ty of advancing by illustrat ion or definition beyond a reasonable faith, or a simp le negation of mater iality, yet he could not wholly desist from the endeavor to illustrate the nature of this non-ma tter or mind, by symbols drawn from those ph ysical considerations which decided him in placing it in a separate categor y. Whether as human reason, or as the regulating Principle in nature, he held it different from all other things in character and effect, and that therefore it must necessaril y differ in its essential constitution. It was neither Matter, nor a Force conjoined with matter, or homogen eous with it, but independent and genericall y distinct, especiall y in this, that, being the source of all motion, separation, and cognition, it is something entirely unique, pure, and unmixed ; and so, being unhindered b y any interfering influence limiting its independence of individual action, it has Supreme Empire over all things, over the vortex of worlds as well as over all that live in them. It is most penetrating and powerful, mixing with other things, though no other thing mixes with it; exercises universal control and cognition, and includes the Necessity of the Poets, as well as the independent power of thought which we exercise within ourselves. In short, it is the self- conscious power of thought extended to the Universe, and exalted into the Supreme External Mind w hich sees, know s, and directs all things. Page 486 of 621"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Thus Pantheis m and Material ism were both avoided; and ma tter, though as infinitel y varied as the senses represent it, was held in a bond of unit y transferred to a ruling power apart from it. That Power could not be Prime Mover, if it were itself moved; nor All- Governing, if not apart from the things it governs. If the arranging Principle were inherent in matter, it would have been impossible to account for the existence of a chaos: if something external , then the old Ionian doctrine of a \"beginning\" became more easily conceivabl e, as being the epoch at which the Arranging Intell igence commenced its operations. But this grand idea of an all- governing independent mind involved difficulties which proved insuperable; because it gave to matter, in the form of chaos, an independent and eternal self-existence, and so introduced a dualism of mind and matter. In the Mind or Intelligence, Anaxagoras included not onl y life and motion, but the moral principles of the noble and good; and probably used the term on account of the popular misappl ication of the word \" God,\" and as being less liable to misconstruct ion, and mor e specifical ly marking his idea. His \"Intelligenc e\" principle remain ed practica lly liable to man y of the same defects as the \"Necessit y\" of the poets. It was the presenti ment of a great idea, which it was for the time impossibl e to explain or follow out. It was not yet intelligible, nor was even the road opened through which it migh t be approached. Mind cannot advance in metaphysics beyond self-deificat ion. In attempting to go further, it only enacts the apotheosis of its own subtle conceptions, and so sinks below the simpler ground alread y taken. The realities which Plato could not recognize in phenomen a, he discovered within his own mind, and as unhesitating ly as the old Theosophists installed its creations among the gods. He, like most philosophers after Anaxagoras, made the Supreme Being to be Intell igence; but in other respects left His nature undefined, or rather indefinite through the variet y of definitions, a conception vaguel y floating between Theism and Pan- theism. Though deprecating the demoral izing tendencies of poetr y, he was too wise to attempt to replace them by other representations of a positive kind. He ju stly says, that spiritual things can be made intelligible only through figures; and the forms of allegori cal expression which, in a rude age, had been adopted unconsciously , were designedl y chosen by the philosopher as the most appropriate vehicles for theological ideas. As the devices of symbolism were graduall y stripped away, in order, if possible, to reach the fundamen tal conception, the religious feeling habituall y connected with it seemed to evaporate under the process. And ye t the advocates of Monotheism, Xenophanes and Heraclitus, declaimed only against the mak ing of gods in human form. They did not attempt to strip nature of its divinit y, but rather to recall religious contemplation from an exploded symbolism to a purer one. They continued the veneration which, in the background of poetry , has been maintained for Sun and Stars, the Fire or Ether. Socrates prostrated himself before the rising lu minary; and the eternal spheres, which seem to have shared the religious homage of Xenophanes, retained a secondar y and qualified Divinit y in the Schools of the Peripatet ics and Stoics. The unseen being or beings revealed only to the Intelle ct became the the me of philosophy ; and their mor e ancient symbols, if not openl y discredited, were passed over with evasive generali ty, as beings respecting whose problem atical existence we must be \"content with Page 487 of 621"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike what has been reported by those ancients, who, as suming to be their descendants, must therefore be supposed to have been well acquainted with their own ancestors and fam ily connections.\" And the Theism of Anaxagoras was still more decidedl y subversive, not only of Mythology, but of the whole religion of outward nature; it being an appeal from the world without, to the consciousness of s piritual dignity within man. In the doctrines of Aristotle, the world moves on uninterrupted ly, always changing, yet ever the same, like Time, the Eternal Now, knowing neither repose nor death. There is a principle which makes good the failure of identit y , by multiplying resemblances ; the destruction of the individual by an eternal renewal of the form in which matter is manifested. This regular eternal movement implies an Eternal Mover; not an inert Eternit y, such as the Platonic Eidos , but one alway s acting , His essence being to act , for otherwise he might never have acted, and the existence of the world would be an accident ; for what should have, in that case, decided Him to act, after long inactiv ity? Nor can He be partl y in act and partl y potential , that is, quiescent and undeterm ined to act or not to act, for even in that case motion would not be eternal, but contingent and precarious. He is therefore wholly in act , a pure, untiring activity, and for the sane reasons wholl y immaterial. Thus Aristotle avoided the idea that God was inactive and self-contem plative for an eternit y, and then for some unknown reason, or by some unknown motiv e, commenced to act outwardl y and produce; but he incurred the opposite hazard, of making the result of His action, matter and the Universe, be co-existent with Himself ; or, in other word s, of den ying that there was any time when His outward action commenced . The First Cause, he said, unmoved, moves all. Act was first , and the Universe has existed forever; one persistent cause directing its continui ty. The unity of the First Mover follows from His immateriality. If He were not Himself unmoved, the series of mot ions and causes of motion would be infinite. Unmoved, therefore, and unchangeable Himself, all movement, even that in space, is caused b y Him: He is necessary : He cannot be otherwise than as He is; and it is only through the necessit y of His being that we can account for those necessary eternal relations which make a science of Being possible. Thus A ristotle leaned to a seeming ly personal God; not a Being of parts and passions, like the God of the Hebrews, or that of the mass even of educated men in our own day , but a Substantial Head of all the categories of being, an Individualit y of Intelligenc e, the dogma of Anaxagoras revived out of a more elaborate and profound anal ysis of Nature; something like that living unambiguous Principle which the old poets, in advance of the m aterialistic cosmogon ists from Night and Chaos, had discovered in Ouranos or Zeus. Soon, however, the vision of personalit y is withdrawn, and we reach that culmin ating point of thought where the real blends with the ideal; where mora l action and objective thought (that is, thought exercised as to anything outside of itself), as well as the material body, are excluded; and where the divine action in the world retains its veil of impenetr able mystery, and to the ut most ingenuit y of research presents but a contradict ion. At this extre me, the series of efficient causes resolves itself into the Final Cause. That which moves, itself un moved, can only be the immobility of Thought or Form. God is both formal, efficient, and final cause; the One Form comprising all forms, the one good including all good, the goal of the longing of the Universit y, moving the world as the object of love or rational desire moves the individual. He is the internal or self- realized Final Cause, having no end bey ond Himself. He is no moral agent; for if He were, He w ould be but an instrument for producing someth ing still Page 488 of 621"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike higher and greater. One sort of act only, activity of mind or thought, can be assigned to Him who is at once all act yet all repose. What we call our highest pleasure, which distinguishes wakefulness and sensation, and which gives a reflected charm to hope and memory, is with Him perpetual. His existence is unbroken enjoyment of that which is most excellen t but only tempor ary with us. The divine quality of active and yet tranquil self- contemplation characteriz ing intelligence, is pre-em inently possessed b y the divine mind; His thought, which is His existence, being, unlike ours, unconditional and wholly act. If He can receive any gratific ation or enjoyment from that which exists be yond Himself, He can also be displeased and pained with it, and then He would be an imperf ect being. To suppose pleasure experienced by Him from anything outward, suppo ses an insufficient prior enjoyment and happiness, and a sort of dependenc y. Man's Good is be yond himself; not so God's. The eternal act which produces the world's life is the eternal desire of good. The object of the Absolute Thought is the Ab solute Good. Nature is all mov ement, and Thought all repose. In conte mplating that absolute good, the Finality can contemp late only itself; and thus, all material interference being excluded, the distinction of subject and object vanishes in compl ete identifica tion, and the Divine Thought is \"the thinking of thought.\" The energy of mind is life, and God is that energ y in its purity and perfection. He is therefore life itself, eternal and perfect; and this sums up all that is meant by the term \"God.\" And ye t, after all this transcendenta lism, the ver y essence of thought consists in its mobility and power of transference from object to object; and we can conceive of no thought, without an object beyond itself, about which to think, or of an y activity in mere self-contemp lation, without out-ward act, movem ent, or man ifestation. Plato endeavors to show how the Divine Principle of Good becomes realized in Nature: Aristotle's s ystem is a vast analogica l induction to prove how all Nature tends toward a final good. Plato considered Soul as a principle of move ment, and made his Deit y realize, that is, turn into realit ies, his ideas as a free, intell igent Force. Aristotle, for whom Soul is the motion less centre from which mo tion radiates, and to which it converges, conceives a correspondingl y unmoved God. The Deity of Plato creates, superintends, and rejoices in the universal joy of, His creatures. That of Aristotle is the perfection of man's intell ectual activity extended to the Universe. When he makes the Deit y to be an eternal act of self- contemplation, the world is not excluded from His cognizance, for He conte mplates it within Himself. Apart from and be yond the world, He y et mysteriously intermingles with it. He is universal as well as individual ; His agency is necessar y and general, yet also makes the real and the good of the particular. When Plato had given to the unformed world the ani mal life of the Ionians, and added to that the Anaxagorean Intelligence, overruling the wild principle of Necessit y; and when to Intelligence was added Beneficence; and the dread Wardours, Force and Strength, were made subordinate to Mildness and Goodness, it seem ed as if a further advance were impossibl e, and that the Deny could not be more than The Wise and The Good. But the conte mplation of the Good impl ies that of its opposite, Evil. When God is held to be \"The Good,\" it is not because Evil is unknown, but because it is designedl y excluded from His attribut es. But if Evil be a separate and independent existence, how w ould it fare with His prerogative of Unity and Suprema cy? To meet this dile mma, it remain ed only to fall back on something more or less akin to the vagueness of antiquit y; to make a virtual Page 489 of 621"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike confession of ignorance, to deny the ultimate reality of evil, like Plato and Aristotle, or, with Speusippus, the eternity of its antitheti cal existence, to surmise that it is onl y one of those notions which are indeed provisionall y indispensable in a condition of finite knowledge, but of which so man y have been already discredited by the advance of philosoph y; to revert, in short, to the original conception of \"The Absolute,\" or of a single Being, in whom all mysteries are explained, and before whom the disturbing principle is reduced to a mere turbid spot on the ocean of Eterni ty, which to the eye of faith may be said no longer to exist. But the absolute is nearl y allied to the non-existent. Matter and evil obtruded themse lves too constantl y and convincingl y to he confuted or cancelled by subtleties of Logic. It is in vain to attempt to merg e the world in God, w hile the world of experience exhibits contrarie ty, imperf ection, and mu tability, instead of the immutability of its source. Philosoph y was but another name for uncertaint y; and after the mind had successivel y deified Nature and its own conceptions, without any practica l result but toilso me occupation ; when the reality it sought, without or within, seemed ever to elude its grasp, the intellec t, baffled in its higher flights, sought advantage and repose in ai ming at truth of a lower but more applicable kind. The Deity of Plato is a Being proportioned to human sympathies; the Father of the World, as well as its Creator; the author of good onl y, not of evil. \"Envy,\" he says, \"is far remov ed from celestial beings, and man, if willing, and braced for the effort, is perm itted to aspire to a communion with the solemn troops and sweet societies of Heaven. God is the Idea or Essence of Goodness, t he Good itself [τ ὸ ἀ γαθ ό ν]; in goodness, He created the World, and gave to it the greatest perfection of which it was susceptible; making it, as far as possible, an image of Himself. The sublime type of all excellen ce is an object not onl y of veneration bu t love.\" The Sages of old had alread y intimated in enigm as that God is the Author of Good; that like the Sun in Heaven, or Æscu lapius on earth, He is \"Healer,\" \"Saviour,\" and \"Redee mer,\" the destro yer and averter of Evil, ever healing the misch iefs inflicted by Herè, the wanton or irrational power of nature. Plato only asserts with mor e distinctness the dogm a of antiquit y when he recognizes LOVE as the highest and most beneficent of gods, who gives to nature the invigorating energy restored b y the art of m edicine to the bod y; since Love is emphat ically the physician of the Universe, the Æs culapius to whom Socrates wished to sacrifice in the hour of his death. A figurative idea, adopted from familiar imagery, gave that endearing aspect to the divine connection with the Universe which had com manded the earliest assent of the senti ments, until, rising in refinem ent with the progres s of men tal cultivation, it ultimately established itself as firm ly in the deliberat e approbation of the understanding, as it had ever responded to the sympathies. Even the rude Sc ythians, Bithynians, and Scandinavians, called God their \"Father\"; all nations traced their ancestry more or less directl y to Heaven. The Hyperborean Olen, one of the oldest s ymbols of the religious antiquit y of Greece, made Love the First- born of N ature. Who will venture to pronounce at what ti me God was first worthil y and trul y honored, or when man first began to feel aright the mut e eloquence of nature? In the obscure ph ysics of the mystical Theologers who preceded Greek philosophy , Page 490 of 621"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Love was the Great First Cause and Parent of the Universe. \"Zeus,\" says Proclus, \"when entering upon the work of creation, changed Himself into the form of Love: and He brought forward Aphroditè, the principle of Unit y and Universal Harmon y, to display her light to all. In the depths of His m ysterious being, He contains the principle of love within Himself ; in Him creative wisdom and blessed love are united.\" \"F rom the first Of Days on these his love divine be fixed, His admiration; ti ll in time complete What he admired and loved, his vital sm ile Unfolded into being.\" The speculators of the venerable East, who had conceived the idea of an Eternal Being superior to all affection and change, in his own sufficienc y enjoying a plenitude of serene and independent bliss, were led to inquire into the apparentl y inconsistent fact of the creation of the world. Wh y, they asked, did He, who required nothing external to Himse lf to comple te His alread y-existing Perfection, come forth out of His unrevealed and perfect existence, and become incorporated in the vicissitudes of nature? The solution of the difficult y was Love. The Great Being beheld the beaut y of His o wn conception, which dwelt with Him alone from the beginning, Maia, or Nature' s loveliness, at once the germ of passion and the source of worlds. Love beca me the universal parent, when the Deity, before remote and inscrutable, became ideally separated into the loving and the beloved. And here again recurs the ancient difficul ty; that, at whatever early period this creation occurred, an eternit y had previousl y elapsed, during which God, d welling alone in His unimpeached unity, had no ob ject for His love; and that the ver y word imp lies to us an existing object toward which the love is directed; so that we cannot conceive of love in the absence of any object to be loved; and therefore we again return to this point, that if love is of God' s essence, and He is unchangeable, the same necessit y of His nature, supposed to have caused creation, must ever have made His existence without an object to love impossibl e: and so that the Universe must have been co- existent with Himself. The questions how and why evil exists in the Universe: how its existence is to be reconciled with the admitted wisdom and goodness and omnipot ence of God; and ho w far man is a free agent, or controlled by an inexorable necessity or destin y, have two sides. On one, they are questions as to the qualities and attribu tes of Got; for we must infer His moral nature from His mode of governing the Universe, and the y ever enter into any consideration of His intellectual nature: and on the other, they directly concern the mora l responsibilit y, and therefore the destin y, of man. All-import ant, therefore, in both points of view, they have been much discussed in all ages of the world, and have no doubt urged men, more than all other questions have, to endeavor to fathom the profound m ysteries of the Nature and the mode of Existence and action of an incompr ehensible God. And, with these, still another question also presents itself: whether the Deity govern s the Universe b y fixed and unalterab le laws, or b y special Providences and interferences, so that He may be induced to change His cour se and the results of human or material action, by prayer and supplication. God alone is all-powerful; but the human soul has in all ages asserted its claim to be considered as part of the Divine. \"The purit y of the spirit,\" says Van Helmont, \"is shown Page 491 of 621"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike through energy and efficac iousness of will. God, by the agenc y of an infinite will, created the Universe, and the same sort of power in an inferior degree, limited more or less by external hindrances, exists in all spiritual beings.\" The higher we ascend in antiquit y, the more does pray er take the form of incantat ion; and that form it still in a great degree retains, since the rites of public worship are generall y considered not mer ely as an expression of trust or reverence, as real spiritual acts, the effect of which is looked for onl y within the mind of the worshipper, but as acts from which some direct outward result is anticipated, the attain ment of some desired object, of health or wealth, of supernatural gifts for bod y or soul, of exe mption from danger, or vengeance upo n enemies. Prayer was able to change the purposes of Heaven, and to make the Devs tremble under the abyss. It exercised a compulsory influence over the gods. It promoted the magnetic sympathy of spirit with spirit; and the Hind and Persian liturgies, addr ū essed not onl y to the Deity Himself, but to His diversified manifestations, were considered wholesome and necessary iterations of the living or creativ e Word which at first effectua ted the divine will, and which from instant to instant supports the universal frame by its eternal repetition. In the narrative of the Fall we have the Hebrew mode of explaining the great moral mystery, the origin of evil and the apparent estrangem ent from Heaven; and a simi lar idea, variousl y modifi ed, obtained in all the ancient creeds. Ever ywhere, man had at the beginning been innocent and happ y, and had lapsed, b y temptation and his o wn weakness, from his first estate. Thus was accounted for the presumed connection of increase of knowledge with increase of miser y, and, in particul ar, the great penalt y of death was reconciled with Divine Justice. Subordinate to these greater points were the questions, Why is the earth covered with thorns and weeds? whence the origin of clothing, of sexual shame and passion ? whence the inflict ion of labor, and how to j ustify the degraded condition of woman in the East, or account for the loathing so generall y felt toward the Serpent Tribe? The hypothesis of a fall, required under some of its modifi cations in all systems, to account for the apparent imperf ection in the work of a Perfect Being, was, in Eastern philosoph y, the unavoidable accompaniment and condition of limited or individual existence; since the Soul, considered as a fragm ent of the Universal Mind, might be said to have lapsed from its pre-emin ence when parted from its source, and ceasing to form part of integral perfection. The theor y of its reunion was correspondent to the assumed cause of its degradation. To reach its prior condition, its individuali ty must cease; it must be emancipated by re-absorption into the Infinite, the consum mation of all things in God, to be promoted by human effort in spiritual meditation or self- mortification, and comp leted in the magical transformat ion of death. And as man had fallen, so it was held that the Angels of Evil had, from their first estate, to which, like men, they were, in God 's good ti me, to be restored, and the reign of evil was then to cease forever. To this great result all the Ancient Theologies point; and thus the y all endeavored to reconcile the existence of Sin and Evil with the perfect and undeniable wisdom and beneficence of God. With man's exercise of thought are inseparabl y connected freedom and respon sibility. Man assumes his proper rank as a moral agent, when with a sense of the li mitations of his nature Page 492 of 621"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike arise the consciousness of freedom, and of the obligations accompanying its exercise, the sense of dut y and of the capacit y to perform it. To suppo se that man ever imagined himself not to be a free agent until he had argued himself into that belief, would be to suppo se that he was in that below the brutes; for he, like them, is conscious of his freedom to act. Experience alone teaches him that this freedom of action is limited and controlled; and when what is outward to him restrains and li mits this freedom of action, he instinctiv ely rebels against it as a wrong. The rule of dut y and the m aterials of experience are derived from an acquaintanc e with the conditions of the external world, in which the faculties are exerted; and thus the problem of man involves those of Nature and God. Our freedom, we learn by experience, is determ ined by an agency external to us; our happiness is inti mately dependent on the relations of the outward World, and on the mora l character of its Ruler. Then at once arises this proble m: The God of Nature must be One, and His character cannot be suspected to be other than good. Whence, then, cam e the evil, the consciousness of which must invariabl y have preceded or accomp anied man's moral developmen t? On this subject hum an opinion has ebbed and flowed between two contradic tory extremes, one of which seems inconsistent with God 's Omnipot ence, and the other with His beneficence. If God, it was said, is perfectl y wise and good, evil must arise from some independent and hostile principle : if, on the other hand, all agencies are subordinate to One, it is difficult, if evil does indeed exist, if there is any such thing as Evil, to avoid the impiety of making God the Author of it. The recognition of a moral and phy sical dualism in nature was adverse to the doctrine of Divine Unity. Many of the Ancients thought it absurd to imagine one Supreme Being, like Homer's Jove, distributing good and evil out of two urn s. They therefore substituted, as we have seen, the doctrine of two distinct and eternal principles; some making the cause of evil to be the inherent imperfec tion of matt er and the flesh, without explaining how God was not the cause of that; while others personified the required agency , and fancifull y invented an Evil Principle, the question of who se origin indeed involved all the difficult y of the original problem, but whose existence, if once taken for granted, was sufficient as a popular solution of the m ystery; the difficult y being supposed no longer to exist when pushed a step further off, as the difficult y of conceiving the world upheld by an elephant was suppo sed to be got rid of when it was said that the elephant was supported by a tortoise. The simpler, and probabl y the older, notion, treated the one only God as the Author of all things. \"I form the light,\" says Jehovah, \"and create darkness; I cause prosperit y and create evil; I, the Lord, do all these things.\" \"All mankind,\" says Maximus Tyrius, \"are agreed that there exists one only Universal King and Father, and that the many gods are His Children.\" There is nothing improbabl e in the suppo sition that the primitive idea was that there was but one God. A vague sense of Nature's U nity, blended with a di m perception of an all-pervading Spiritual Essence, has been re marked among the earliest manifestations of the Human Mind. Ever ywhere it was the dim remembrance, uncertain and indefinite, of the original truth taught by God to the first men. The Deity of the Old Testa ment is every where represented as the direct author of Evil, commissioning evil and lying spirits to men, hardening the heart of Pharaoh, and visiting Page 493 of 621"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the iniquity of the individual sinner on the whole people. The rude conception of sternnes s predom inating over mer cy in the Deit y, can alone account for the human sacrifices, purposed, if not executed, by Abraham and Jephthah. It has not been uncomm on, in any age or country of the world, for men to recognize the existence of one God, without forming any becoming estimate of His dignit y. The causes of both good and ill are referred to a mysterious centre, to which each assigns such attribut es as correspond with his own intellect and advance in civili zation. Hence the assignment to the Deity of the feelings of envy and jealousy. Hence the provocation given b y the healing skill of Æsculap ius and the humane theft of fire by Prometheus. The very spirit of Nature, personified in Orpheus, Tantalus, or Phineus was suppo sed to have been killed, confined, or blinded, for having too freely divulged the Divine M ysteries to mankind. This Divine Envy still exists in a modified form, and varies according to circu mstances. In Hesiod it appears in the lowest type of human malignity. In the God of M oses, it is jealousy of the infringem ent of the autocrat ic power, the check to politica l treason; and even the penalties denounced for worshipping other gods often seem dictated rather by a jealous regard for His own greatness in Deit y, than by the immorality and degraded nature of the worship itself. In Herodotus and other writers it assumes a more philosophical shape, as a strict adherence to a moral equilibr ium in the governm ent of the world, in the punishment of pride, arrogance, and insolent pretension. God acts providentia lly in Nature b y regular and universal laws, b y constant modes of operation; and so takes care of material things without violating their constitution, acting always according to the nature of the things which He has mad e. It is a fact of observation that, in the ma terial and unconscious world, He works by its materiality and unconsciousness, not against them; in the ani mal world, by its animality and partial consciousness, not against them. So in the providential government of the world, He acts by regular and universal laws, and constant modes of operation; and so takes care of human things without violating their constitution, acting always according to the human nature of man, not against if, working in the human world by means of man's consciousness and partial freedom, not against them. God acts b y general laws for general purposes. The attraction of gravitation is a good thing, for it keeps the world together; and if the tower of Siloa m, thereby falling to the ground, sla ys eighteen men of Jerusalem, that number is too small to think of, considering the myriad millions who are upheld by the same law. It could not well be repealed for their sake, and to hold up that tower; nor could it remain in force, and the tower stand. It is difficult to conceive of a Perfect Will without confounding it with something like mechanism; since language has no name for that combination of the Inexorable with the Moral, which the old poets personified separatel y in Ananke or Eimar mene and Zeus. How combine understandingl y the Perfect Freedom of the Supreme and All-Sovereign Will of God with the inflexible necessity , as part of His Es sence, that He should and must continue to be, in all His great attributes, of justice and mercy for exa mple, what He is now and always has been, and with the impossibi lity of His changing His nature and becom ing unjust, merciless, cruel, fickle, or of Hi s repealing the great moral laws which mak e crime wrong and the practice of virtue right? Page 494 of 621"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike For all that we fami liarly know of F ree-Will is that capricious exercise of it which we experience in ourselves and other men ; and therefore the notion of Supreme Will, still guided by Infallible Law, even if that law be self-i mposed, is alwa ys in danger of being either stripped of the essential quality of Freedom, or degraded under the ill-name of Necessit y to something of even less mora l and intellectu al dignity than the fluctuating course of hum an operations. It is not until we elevate the idea of law above that of partialit y or tyranny, that we discover that the self-imposed limitations of the Suprem e Cause, constituting an arra y of certain alternatives, regulating moral choice, are the very sources and safeguards of human freedom; and the doubt recurs, w hether we do not set a law above God Himse lf; or whether laws self-i mposed may not be self-repealed : and if not, what power prevents it. The Zeus of Homer, like that of Hesiod, is an arra y of antitheses, combin ing strength with weakness, wisdom with foll y, universal parentage with narrow family limitation, omnipo tent control over events with submission to a superior destiny ;-DESTINY, a nam e by means of which the theological problem was cast back into the original obscurity out of which the powers of the human mind have proved the mselves as incapable of rescuing it, as the efforts of a fl y caught in a spider's w eb to do more than increase its entangle ment. The oldest notion of Deit y was rather indefinite than repulsive. The positive degradation was of later growth. The God of nature reflects the changeful character of the seasons, varying from dark to bright. Alternate ly angry and serene, and lavishing abundance which she again withdraws, nature seems inexplicab ly capricious, and though capable of responding to the highest require ments of the moral sentim ent through a general comprehension of her mysteries, more liable by a partial or hast y view to becom e darkened into a Siva, a Saturn, or a Mexitli, a patron of fierce orgies or blood-stained altars. All the older poetical personifications exhibit traces of this amb iguity. They are neither wholly immoral nor purely beneficen t. No people have ever deliberate ly made their Deity a malevo lent or guilt y Being. The simple piety which ascribed the origin of all things to God, took all in good part, trusting and hoping all things. The Supreme Ruler was at first looked up to with unquestioning reverence. No startling discords or contradic tions had yet raised a doubt as to His beneficenc e, or made men dissatisfied with His governm ent. Fear might cause anxiet y, but could not banish hope, still less inspire aversion. It was only later, when abstract notions began to assume the semblanc e of realit ies, and when new or more distinct ideas suggested new words for their expression, that it became necessary to fix a definite barrier between Evil and Good. To account for moral evil, it became necessary to devise some new expedient suited both to the piet y and self- compla cency of the inventor, such as the perversit y of woman, or an agent distinct from God, a Typhon or Ahriman, obtained either by dividing the Gods into two classes, or b y dethroning the Ancient Divinit y, and changing him into a Dev or Dæmon. Through a simil ar want, the Orientals devised the inherent corruption of the fleshy and mater ial; the Hebrew transferred to Satan ever ything illegal and immoral; and the Greek reflection, occasionall y adopting the older and truer view, retorted upon man the obloquy cast on these creatures of his imagin ation, and sho wed how he has to thank Page 495 of 621"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike himself alone for his cala mities, while his good things are the voluntar y gifts , not the plunder of Heaven. Homer had already made Zeus exclaim , in the Assembly of Olympus, \"Grievous it is to hear these mort als accuse the Gods; the y pretend that evils come from us; but they themselves occasion them gratuitousl y by their own wanton foll y.\" \"It is the fault of man,\" said Solon; in reference to the social evils of his da y, \"not of God, that destruction comes;\" and Euripides, after a forma l discussion of the origin of evil, comes to the conclusion that men act wrongl y, not from want of natural good sense and feeling, but because knowing what is good, the y yet for various reasons neglect to practise it. And at last reaching the highest truth, Pindar, Hesiod, Æsch ylus, Æsop, and Horace said, \"All virtue is a struggle; life is not a scene of repose, but of energetic action. Suffering is but another na me for the teaching of experience, appointed by Zeus himse lf, the giver of all understanding, to be the parent of instruction, the schoolmaster of life. He indeed put an end to the golden age; he gave venom to serpents and predacit y to wolves; he shook the honey from the leaf, and stopped the flow of wine in the rivulets; he concealed the element of fire, and made the means of life scanty and precarious. But in all this his object was beneficent ; it was not to destro y life, but to improve it. It was a blessing to man, not a curse, to be sentenced to earn his bread b y the sweat of his brow; for nothing great or excellen t is attain able without exertion; safe and eas y virtues are prized neither by gods nor men; and the parsimoniousness of nature is justified by its powerful effect in rousing the dorman t faculties, and forcing on m ankind the invention of useful arts by means of meditation and thought.\" Ancient religious reformers pronounced the worship of \"idols\" to be the root of all evil; and there have been man y iconoclasts in different ages of the world. The maxim still holds good; for the worship of idols, that is, of fanciful conceits, if not the source of all evil, is still the cause of much ; and it prevails as extensivel y now as it ever did. Men are ever engaged in worshipping the picturesque fancies of their own imagina tions. Human wisdom must always be limited and incorrect ; and even right opinion is onl y a something intermediate between ignorance and knowledge. The normal condition of man is that of progress. Philosophy is a kind of journey , ever learning, yet never arriving at the ideal perfection of truth. A Mason s hould, like the wise Socrates, assume the mod est title of a \"lover of wisdom\"; for he must ever long after something more excellen t than he possesses, someth ing still beyond his reach, which he desires to make eternall y his own. Thus the philosophic sentimen t came to be associated with the poetical and the religious, under the compreh ensive name of Love. Before the birth of Philosoph y, Love had received but scanty and inadequat e homage. This migh tiest and most ancient of gods, coeval with the existence of religion and of the world, had been indeed unconsciously felt, but had neither been worthil y honored nor directl y celebra ted in hymn or pæn. In the old day s of ignorance it could scarcel y have been recognized. In order that it might exercise its proper influence over religion and philosoph y, it was necessar y that the God of N ature should cease to be a God of terrors, a personification of mere Power or arbitrar y Will, a pure and stern Intelligence, an inflictor of evil, and an unrelenting Judge. The philosoph y of Plato, in which this charge became forever established, was emphatically a mediation of Love. With him, the inspiration of Love first kindled the light of arts and imparted them to Page 496 of 621"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike mankind; and not onl y the arts of mer e existence, but the heavenl y art of wisdom, which supports the Universe. It inspires high and generous deeds and noble self-devotion. Without it, neither State nor individual could do an ything beautiful or great. Love is our best pilot, confederate, supporter, and saviour; the ornament and governor of all things human and divine; and he with divine harmon y forever soothes the minds of men and gods. Man is capable of a higher Love, which, marr ying mind with mind and with the Universe, brings forth all that is noblest in his faculti es, and lifts him beyond himself. This higher love is neither mortal nor immortal, but a power intermediate between the human and the Divine, filling up the mighty interval, and binding the Universe together. He is chief of those celestial emissaries who carry to the gods the prayers of men, and bring down to men the gifts of the gods. \"He is forever poor, and far from being beautiful as mankind imagin e, for he is squalid and withered; he flies low along the ground, is homeless and unsandalled; sleeping without covering before the doors and in the unsheltered streets, and posses sing so far his moth er's nature as being ever the companion of want. Yet, sharing also that of his father, he is forever scheming to obtain things good and beautiful; he is fearless, vehem ent, and strong; alway s devising some new contrivance; strictly cautious and full of inventive. resource; a philosopher through his whole existence, a powerful enchanter, and a subtle sophist.\" The ideal consumm ation of Platonic science is the arrival at the contemp lation of that of which earth exhibits no express im age or adequate similitude, the Supreme Prototype of all beauty, pure and uncontam inated with human intermixture of flesh or color, the Divine Original itself. To one so qualified is given the prerogative of bringing forth not mere images and shadows of virtue, but virtue itself, as having been conversant not with shadows, but with the truth; and having so brought forth and nurtured a progen y of virtue, he becomes the friend of God, and, so far as such a privilege can belong to any human being, immortal. Socrates believed, like Heraclitus, in a Universal Reason pervading all things and all minds, and consequentl y revealing itself in ideas. He therefore sought truth in general opinion, and perceived in the co mmunication of mind with mind one of the greatest prerogatives of wisdom and the most powerful means of advance ment. He believed true wisdom to be an attainab le idea, and that the moral convictions of the mind, those eternal instincts of temperanc e, conscientiousness, and justice, implanted in it by the gods, could not deceive, if rightl y interpret ed. This metaph ysical direction given to philosoph y ended in visionar y extravagance. Having assumed truth to be discover-able in thought, it proceeded to treat thoughts as truths. It thus became an idolatr y of notions, which it considered either as phanto ms exhaled from objects, or as portions of the divine pre-existent thought; thus creating a mythology of its own, and escaping from one thraldom only to enslave itself afresh. Theories and notions indiscri minately formed and defended are the false gods or \"idols\" of philosoph y. For the word idolon means image, and a false mind -picture of God is as much an idol as a false wooden image of Him. Fearlessl y launching into the proble m of universal being, the first philosoph y attempted to supply a comp endious and decisive solution of ever y doubt. To do Page 497 of 621"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike this, it was obliged to make the most sweeping assumptions; and as poetry had already filled the vast void between the human and the divine, by personif ying its Deit y as man, so philosoph y bowed down before the supposed reflection of the divine image in the mind of the inquirer, who, in worshipping his own notions, had unconsciousl y deified himself. Nature thus wa s enslaved to common notions, and notions ver y often to words. By the clashing of incompa tible opinions, philosoph y was graduall y reduced to the ignominious confession of utter incapac ity, and found its check or intellec tual fall in skepticism . Xenophanes and Heraclitus mournfull y acknowledged the unsatisfactor y result of all the struggles of philosoph y, in the adm ission of a universalit y of doubt; and the memorable effort of Socrates to rally the discomfi ted champions of truth, ended in a similar confession. The worship of abstractions continued the error which personified Evil or deified Fortune; and when mystical philosophy resigned its place to mystical religion, it changed not its nature, but onl y its name. The great task remain ed unperformed, of reducing the outward world and its principles to the dominion of the intellect, and of reconciling the conception of the supreme unalterab le power asserted by reason, with the requisitions of human sympathies. A general idea of purpose and regularit y in nature had been suggested by common appearances to the earliest reflection. The ancients perceived a natural order, a divine legislation, from which human institutions were supposed to be derived, laws embla zoned in Heaven, and thence revealed to earth. But the divine law was little more than an analogica l inference from human law, taken in the vulgar sense of arbitrar y will or partial covenant. It was surmised rather than discovered, and rema ined unmora l because unintell igible. It mattered little, under the circums tances, whether the Universe were said to be governed b y chance or by reason, since the latter, if misunderstood, was virtuall y one with the former. \"Better far,\" said Epicurus, \"acquiesce in the fables of tradition, than acknowledge the oppres sive necessit y of the ph ysicists\"; and Menander speaks of God, Chance, and Intellig ence as undistinguishable. Law unacknowledged goes under the name of Chance : perceived, but not understood, it becom es Necessity . The wisdom of the Stoic was a dogged submission to the arbitrar y behests of one; that of the Epicurean an advantage snatched by more or less dexterous man agement from the equal tyranny of the other. Ignorance sees nothing necessary , and is self abandoned to a power tyrannical because defined by no rule, and paradoxical because perm itting evil, while itself assumed to be unlimited, all-powerful, and perfectl y good. A little knowledge, presuming the identification of the Supreme Cause with the inevitab le certain ty of perfect reason, but omitting the analysis or interpreta tion of it, leaves the mind chain-bound in the ascetic fatalism of the Stoic. Free-will, coupled with the universal rule of Chance; or Fatalis m and Necessit y, coupled with Omniscienc e and fixed and unalterab le Law, these are the alternatives, between which the human mind has eternall y vacillat ed. The Supernatural ists, contemplating a Being acting through impu lse, though with superhum an wisdom, and considering the best courtier to be the most favored sub ject, combin es contradictor y expedients, inconsistentl y mixing the assertion of free action with the enervating service of Page 498 of 621"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike petition ; while he admi ts, in the words of a learned archbishop, that \"if the production of the things we ask for depend on antecedent, natural, and necessary causes, our desires will be answered no less by the omission than the offering of pra yers, which, therefore, are a vain thing.\" The last stage is that in which the religion of action is made legitimate through comprehension of its proper ob jects and conditions. Man becomes morally free onl y when both notions, that of Chance and that of incompreh ensible Necessity , are displaced by that of Law. Law, as applied to the Universe, means that universal, providentia l pre- arrange ment, whose conditions can be discerned and discretional ly acted on by human intelligence. The sense of freedo m arises when the individual independenc e develops itself according to its own laws, without external collisions or hindrance; that of constraint, where it is thwarted or confined by other Natures, or where, by combina tion of external forces, the individual force is compe lled into a new direction. Moral choice would not exist safely, or even at all, unless it were bounded by conditions determ ining its preferences. Duty supposes a rule both intelligib le and certain, since an uncertain rule would be unintell igible, and if unintelligib le, there could be no responsibilit y. No law that is unknown can be obligator y; and that Rom an Emperor was justly execrated, who pretended to promulgat e his penal laws, by putting them up at such a height that none could read them. Man com mands results, onl y by selecting among the contingent the pre- ordained results most suited to his purpo ses. In regard to absolute or divine morality, meaning the final cause or purpo se of those comprehensiv e laws which often seem harsh to the individual, because inflexibl y just and imp artial to the universal, speculation must take refuge in faith; the immediate and obvious purpo se often bearing so small a proportion to a wider and unknown one, as to be relativel y absorbed or lost. The rain that, unseasonable to me, ruins my hopes of an abundant crop, does s o because it could not otherwise have blessed and prospered the crops of another kind of a whole neighboring district of country . The obvious purpose of a sudden storm of snow, or an unexpected change of wind, exposed to which I lose m y life, bears smal l proportion to the great results which are to flow from that storm or wind over a whole continent. So alway s, of the good and ill which at first seemed irreconci lable and capriciousl y distributed, the one holds its ground, the other dim inishes by being explained. In a world of a mult itude of individuals, a world of action and exertion, a world affording, b y the conflict of interests and the clashing of passions, an y scope for the exercise of the manly and generous virtues, even Omnipoten ce cannot make it, that the comfort and convenience of one m an alone shall alwa ys be consulted. Thus the educated mind soon begins to appreciat e the moral superiorit y of a system of law over one of capricious interference ; and as the jumble of means and ends is brought into more intellig ible perspective, partial or seeming good is cheerfull y resigned for the disinterested and universal. Self-restraint is found not to impl y self-sacrifice. The true meaning of what appeared to be Necessit y is found to be, not arbitrar y Power, but Strength and Force enlisted in the service of Intelligence. God having mad e us men, and placed us in a world of change and eternal renovation, with ample capacit y and abundant means for rational enjoyment, we learn that it is folly to repine because we are not angels, inhabiting Page 499 of 621"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike a world in which change and the clashing of interests and the conflicts of passion are unknown. The mystery of the world rema ins, but is sufficientl y cleared up to inspire confidence. We are constrained to adm it that if every man would but do the best in his power to do, and that which he knows he ought to do, we should need no better world than this. Man, surrounded b y necessit y, is free, not in a dogged determ ination of isolated will, because, though inevitabl y complying with nature's laws, he is able, proportionatel y to his knowledge, to modif y, in regard to himself, the conditions of their action, and so to preserve an average uniformi ty between their forces and his own. Such are some of the conflicting opinions of antiquit y; and we have to some extent presented to you a picture of the Ancient Thought. Faithful, as far as it goes, it exhibits to us Man 's Intellec t ever struggling to pass beyond the narrow bounds of the circle in which its limited powers and its short vision confine it; and ever we find it travelling round the circle, like one lost in a wood, to meet the same unavoidable and insoluble difficulties. Science with her man y instruments, Astronom y, particul arly, with her telescope, Physics with the microscope, and Chemistr y with its anal yses and combina tions, have greatly enlarged our ideas of the Deit y, by discovering to us the vast extent of the Universe in both directions, its star-systems and its invisible swarms of minutest animal life; by acquaint ing us with the new and wonderful Force or Substance we call Electri city, apparentl y a link between Matter and Spirit: and still the Deity only becom es more incomprehensib le to us than ever, and we find that in our speculations we but reproduce over and over again the Ancient Thought. Where, then, amid all these conflicting opinions, is the True Word of a Ma son? My Brother, most of the questions which have thus tortured men's minds, it is not within the reach and grasp of the Human Intellect to understand; but without understanding, as we have explained to you heretofore, we may and must believe . The True Word of a Mason is to be found in the concealed and profound mean ing of the Ineffable Name of Deity , communicated by God to Moses; and which meaning was long lost by the ver y precautions taken to conceal it. The true pronunciation of that name was in truth a secret, in which, however, was involved the far more profound secret of its meaning. In that meaning is included all the truth than can be known by us, in regard to the nature of God. Long known as AL, AL SCH ADAI, AL OHAYIM, and AD ONAI; as the Chief or Commander of the Heavenl y Armies; as the aggregate of the Forces [ ALOHA YIM] of Nature; as the Mighty , the Victorious, the Rival of Bal and Osiris; as the Soul of Nature, Nature itself, a God that was but Man personified, a God with hum an passions, the God of the Heathen with but a mere change of name, He assumes, in His comm unications to Moses, the name יהוה [IHUH], and say s to Him, אשר אהיה אהיה [AHIH ASHR AHI H], I AM WHAT I AM. Let us exam ine the esoteric or inner meaning of this Ineffable Name. היה [HIH] is the imp erfect tense of the verb To BE, of which יהיה [IHIH] is the present; אהי [AHI – א being the personal pronoun \"I\" affixed] the first person, b y apocope; and, יהי Page 500 of 621"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike [IHI] the third. The verb has the following forms:... Preterite, 3d person, mascul ine singular, היה [HIH], did exist, was; 3d person co m. plural, היו [HIU]... Present, 3d pers. masc. sing. יהיה [IHIH], once יהוא [IHUA], by apocope, אהי, יהי [AHI, IHI] . . Infinitive, היה, היו [HIH, H IU]... Impera tive, 2d pers. masc. sing. היה [HIH], fem. הוי [HUI]... Participl e, masc. sing. הוה [HUH], ENS – EXISTIN G . . EXISTENCE . The verb is never used, as the mere logical copula or connecting word, is, was, etc., is used with the Greeks, Latins, and ourselves. It always implies existence, actuality. The present form also includes the future sense, . . shall or may be or exist. A nd הוה and הוא [HUH and HUA] Chaldaic forms of the imp erfect tense of the verb, are the same as the Hebrew הוה and היה [HUH and HI H], and mean was, existed, became. Now הוא and היא [HUA and HI A] are the Personal Pronoun [Masculine and Fem inine], HE, SHE. Thus in Gen. iv. 20 we have the phrase, הוא היה [HUA H IH], HE WAS: and in Lev. xxi. 9, את אביה היא [ATH ABIH H IA], HER Father. This femin ine pronoun, ho wever, is often written הוא [HUA], and היא [HIA] occurs onl y eleven times in the Pentateuch. Sometimes th e femin ine form means IT; but that pronoun is generall y in the mascul ine form. When either, י, ו, ה ,or א , [Y d, Vav, He, or Aleph] terminates a word, and has no vowel ō either immediately preceding or following it, it is often rejected; as in גי [GI], for גיא [GIA], a valley, So הוא־היא [HUA-HIA], He-S he, could properl y be written הו־הי [HU-HI]; or by transposition of the letters, common with the Talmudists, יה־וה [Iii-UH], w hich is the Tetragra mmaton or Ineffable Name. In Gen. i. 27, it is said, \"So the ALHIM created man in His imag e: in the image of ALHIM created He him: MALE and FE-M ALE created He the m.\" Sometimes the word wa s thus expressed; triangularl y: And we learn that this designation of the Ineffable Name was, among the Hebrews, a symbol of Creation. The mysterious union of God with His creatures was in the lette r ה , which they considered to be the Agent of Almigh ty Power; and to enable the possessor of the Name to work miracles. The Personal Pronoun הוא [HUA], HE, is often used by itself , to express the Deity. Lee says that in such cases, IH UH, IH, or AL HIM, or some other name of God, is understood ; but there is no necessit y for that. It means in such cases the Male, Generative, or Creative Principle or Power.

The reversal of the letters of words wa s, indeed, ancientl y common everywhere. Thus from Neitha , the name of an Egy ptian Goddes s, the Greeks, writing backward, formed Athenè , the name of Minerva.

This was the great Mystery of the Ineffable Name; and this true arrange ment of its letters, and of cour se its true pronunciation and its meaning, soon became lost to all except the select few to whom it was confided; it being concealed from the common people, because the Deity thus m etaphysically named was not that personal and capricious, and as it were tangible God in whom they believed, and who alone was within the reach of their rude capacities. Diodorus say s that the name given b y Moses to God w as ΙΑΩ. Theodorus sa ys that the Samaritans termed God IABE , but the Jew s ΙΑΩ. Philo Byblius gives the form ΙΕΥΩ; and Clemens of Alexandria ΙΑΟΥ. Macrobius says that it was an admitted axiom among the Heathen, that the trilitera l ΙΑΩ wa s the sacred na me of the Supreme God. And the Clarian oracle said: \"Learn thou that ΙΑΩ is the great God Supreme, that ruleth over all.\" The letter Ι signified Unity. Α and Ω are the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet. Hence the frequent expres sion: \"I am the First, and I am the Last; and besides Me there is no other God. I am Α and Ω, the First and the Last. I am Α and Ω, the Beginning and the Ending, which Is, and Was, and Is to come: the Omnipot ent.\" For in this we see shadowed forth the same great truth; that God is all in all – the Cause and the Effect – the beginning, or Impulse, or Generative Power: and the Ending, or Result, or that which is produced: that He is in reality all that is, all that ever was, and all that ever will be; in this sense, that nothing besides Himself has existed eternal ly, and co- eternall y with Him, independent of Him, and self-existent, or self- originated. And thus the meaning of the expression, ALOH AYIM, a plural noun, u sed, in the account of the Creation with which Genesis commences, with a singular verb, and of the name or title IHUH-ALHI M, used for the first time in the 4th verse of the 2d chapter of the same book, beco mes clear. The ALHIM is the aggregate unity of the man ifested Creative Forces or Powers of Deity , His Eman ations; and IH UH-ALHI M is the ABSOLUTE Existence, or Essence of these Powers and Forces, of w hich they are Active Manifestations and Emanations.

This was the esoteric meaning of the generation and production of the Indian, Chaldæan, and Phœnician cosmogonies; and the Active and Pas sive Powers, of the Male and Female Principles; of Heaven and its Lum inaries generating, and the Earth producing; all hiding from vulgar view, as above its comprehension, the doctrine that matter is not eternal, but that God was the only original Existence, the ABS OLUTE, from Whom everything has proceeded, and to Whom all returns: and that all moral law springs not from the relation of things, but from His Wisdom and Essential Justice, as the Omnipot ent Legislator. And this Taut WORD is with entire accurac y said to have been lost ; because its meaning was lost, even among the Hebrews, although we still find the name (its real meaning unsuspected), in the Hu of the Druids and the FO -Hi of the Chinese. When we conceive of the Absolute Truth, Beauty , or Good, we cannot stop short at the abstraction of either. We are forced to refer each to some living and substantial Being, in which they have their foundations, some being that is the first and last principle of each. Moral Truth, like every other universal and necessar y truth, cannot remain a mere abstraction. Abstractions are unrealities. In ourselves, moral truth is mer ely conceived of. There must be somewhere a Being that not only conceives of, but constitutes it. It has this character istic; that it is not onl y, to the eyes of our intel ligence, an universal and necessar y truth, but one obligator y on our will. It is A LAW. We do not establish that law ourselves . It is imposed on us despite ourselves: its principle must be without us. It supposes a legislator . He cannot be the being to whom the law applies; but must be one that possesses in the highest degree all the characterist ics of mora l truth. The mora l law, universal and necessar y, necessaril y has as its author a necessary being; – composed of justice and charity, its author most be a being possessing the plenitude of both. As all beautiful and all true things refer themselv es, these to a Unity which is absolute TRUTH, and those to a Unit y which is absolute BEAUTY, so all the moral principles centre in a single principle, which is THE GOOD. Thus we arrive at the conception of GOOD in itself , the ABSOLUTE Good, superior to all particular duties, and deter minate in those duties. This Absolute Good must necessaril y be an attribute of the Absolute BEING. There cannot be several Absolute Beings; the one in whom are realized Absolute Truth and Absolute Beaut y being different from the one in whom is realized Absolute Good. The Absolute necessaril y implies absolute Unity. The True, the Beautiful, and the Good are not three distinct essences: but they are one and the same essence, considered in its fundament al attribut es: the different phases w hich, in our e yes, the Ab solute and Infinite Perfection assumes. Manifested in the World of the Finite and Relativ e, these three attributes separate from each other, and are distinguished by our minds, which can comprehend nothing except by division. But in the Being from Whom they emanate, they are indivisibl y united; and this Being, at once triple and one, Who sums up in Himself perfect Beauty , perfect Truth , and the perfect Good, is G OD. God is necessaril y the principle of Moral Truth, and of personal morality. Man is a mor al person, that is to sa y, one endowed with reason and liberty. He is capable of Virtue: and Page 504 of 621"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Virtue has with him two principal forms, respect for others and love of others, justice and charity . The creature can possess no real and essential attribute which the Creator does not possess. The effect can draw its reality and existence only from its cause . The cause contains in itself, at least, what is essential in the effec t . The characterist ic of the effect is inferiorit y, short-coming, imperfe ction. Dependent and derivate, it bears in itself the marks and conditions of dependence ; and its imperfe ction proves the perfection of the cause; or else there would be in the effect something immanent, without a cause. God is not a logical Being, whose Nature may be explained by deduction, and by means of algebraic equations. When, setting out with a prim ary attribute, the attribu tes of God are deduced one from the other, after the mann er of the Geometri cians and Scholastics, we have nothing but abstractions. We must emerge from this empty dialectic, to arrive at a true and living God. The first notion which we have of God, that of an Infinite Being, is not given us à priori , independentl y of all experienc e. It is our consciousness of ourself, as at once a Being and a li mited Being, that immediately raises us to the conception of a Being, the principle of our being, and Himself without limits. If the existence that we pos sess forces us to recur to a cause pos sessing the same existence in an infinite degree, all the substantial attributes of existence that we pos sess equall y require each an infinite cause. God, then, is no longer the Infinite, Abstract, Indeter minate Being, of which reason and the heart cannot lay hold, but a real Being, determ inate like ourselves, a moral person like ourself; and the study of our o wn souls will conduct us, without resort to h ypothesis, to a conception of God, both sublime and having a connection with ourselves. If man be free, God must be so. It would be strange if, while the creature has that marvellous power of disposing of hi mself, of choosing and willing freely, the Being that has mad e him should be subject to a necessar y developm ent, the cause of which, though in Himself, is a sort of abstract, mechanical, or metaphysical power, inferior to the personal, voluntar y cause which we are, and of which we have the clearest consciousness. God is free because we are: but he is not free as we are. He is at once everything that we are, and nothing that we are. He pos sesses the same attributes as we, but extended to infinit y. He possesses, then, an infinite liberty, united to an infinite intellig ence; and as His intelligen ce is infallib le, exempt from the uncertaint y of delibera tion, and perceiving at a glance where the Good is, s o His libert y accomplishes it spontaneousl y and without effort. As we a ssign to God that liberty which is the basis of our existence, so also we transfer to His character, from our own, j ustice and charit y. In man they are virtues: in God, Hi s attributes. What is in us the laborious conquest of libert y, is in Him His very nature. The idea of the right, and the respect paid to the right, are signs of the dignity of our existence. If respect of rights is the very essence of justice, the Perfect Being must know and respect the rights of the lowest of His creatures; for He assigned the m those rights. In God resides a sovereign justice, that renders to every one what is due him, not according to deceitfu l appearances, but according to the truth of things. And if man, a limited being, has the power to go out of himself, to forget his own person, to love another like himself, and devote himself to his happiness, dignity, and perfection, the Perfect Being must have, in an infinite degree, that disinterested tenderness, that Charity, the Supreme Virtue of the Page 505 of 621"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike human person. There is in God an infinite tenderness for His creatures, manifested in His giving us existence, which He migh t have withheld; and ever y day it appears in innumerable marks of His Divine Providence. Plato well understood that love of God, and expresses it in these great words: \"Let us speak of the cause which led the Supreme Arranger of the Universe to produce and regulate that Universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of ill-will. Exe mpt from that, He willed that created things should be, as far as pos sible, like Himself.\" And Christianit y in its turn said, \" God has s o loved men that He ha s given them His only Son .\" It is not correct to affir m, as is often done, that Christianit y has in some sort discovered this noble sentim ent. We must not lower human nature, to raise Christianit y. Antiquity knew, described, and practised charity; the first feature of which, so touching, and thank God! so common, is goodness, as its loftiest one is heroism. Charity is devotion to another; and it is ridiculousl y senseless to pretend that there ever was an age of the world, when the human soul was deprived of that part of its heritage, the power of devotion. But it is certain that Christianit y has diffused and popularized this virtue, and that, before Christ, these words were never spoken: \"LOVE ONE A NOTHER; FOR THAT IS THE WHOLE LAW.\" Charity presuppo ses Justice . He who trul y loves his brother respects the rights of his brother; but he does more, he forgets his o wn. Egois m sells or takes . Love delights in giving . In God, love is what it is in us; but in an infinite degree. God is inexhaustible in His charity, as He is inexhaustibl e in His essence. That Infinite Omnipotence and Infinite Charity, which, b y an admirab le good-will, draws from the bosom of its im mense love the favors which it incessantl y bestows on the world and on humanit y, teaches us that the more we give, the more we pos sess. God being all just and all good, He can will nothing but what is good and just. Being Omnipot ent, whatever He wills He can do, and consequentl y does. The world is the work of God: it is therefore perfectl y made. Yet there is disorder in the world, that seems to impugn the justice and goodnes s of God. A principle indissolubl y connected with the ver y idea of good, tells us that every moral agent deserves reward when he does well, and punishmen t when he does ill. This principle is universal and necessar y. It is absolute. If it does not apply in this world, it is false, or the world is badl y ordered. But good actions are not alwa ys followed by happiness, nor evil ones by misery. Though often this fact is more apparent than real; though virtue, a war against the passions, full of dignity but full of sorrow and pain, has the latter as its condition, yet the pains that follow vice are greater; and virtue conduces most to health, strength, and long life; – though the peaceful conscience that accomp anies virtue creates internal happiness; though public opinion generall y decides correctl y on men's characters, and rewards virtue with esteem and consideration, and vice with con- tempt and infa my; and though, after all, justice reigns in the world, and the surest road to happiness is still that of virtue, yet there are exceptions. Virtue is not alwa ys rewarded, nor vice punished, in this life. Page 506 of 621"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The data of this problem are these: 1st. The principle of merit and demer it within us is absolute: every good action ought to be rewarded, every bad one punished: 2d. God is ju st as He is all- powerful: 3d. There are in this world particular cases, contradic ting the necessar y and universal law of meri t and de merit. What is the result? To reject the two principles, that God is ju st, and the law of meri t and dem erit absolute, is to raze to the foundations the whole edifice of human faith. To maintain them, is to admit that the present life is to be ter minated or continued elsewhere. The moral person who acts well or ill, and awaits reward or punishment, is connected with a bod y, lives with it, makes use of it, depends upon it in a me asure, but is not it . The body is composed of parts. It di minishes or increases, it is divisible even to infinity. But this something which has a consciousness of itself, and says \"I, ME\"; that feels itself free and responsible, feels too that it is incapabl e of division, that it is a being one and simple ; that the ME cannot be halved, that if a limb is cut off and thrown away , no part of the ME goes with it: that it remains identica l with itself under the variet y of phenom ena which successivel y manifest it. This identi ty, indivisibil ity, and absolute unit y of the person, are its spirituali ty , the very essence of the person. It is not in the least an hypothesis to affirm that the soul differs essentiall y from the body. By the soul we me an the person , not separated from the consciousness of the attributes which constitute it, – thought and will . The Existence without consciousness is an abstract being, and not a person. It is the person , that is identical , one , simple . Its attributes, developing it, do not divide it. Indivisible, it is indissoluble, and ma y be imm ortal. If absolute justice requires this immortality, it does not require what is impossibl e. The spirituality of the soul is the condition and necessary foundation of immortality: the law of meri t and dem erit the direct demonstr ation of it. The first is the metaphysical, the second the mora l proof. Add to these the tendenc y of all the powers of the soul toward the Infinite, and the principle of final causes, and the proof of the immortality of the soul is compl ete. God, therefore, in the Masonic creed, is INFINITE TRUTH, I NFINITE BEAUTY, INFINITE GOODNESS. He is the Holy of Holies, as Author of the Moral Law, as the PRINCI PLE of Libert y, of Justice, and of Charit y, Dispenser of Reward and Punishment. Such a God is not an abstract God; but an intel ligent and free person , Who has made us in His imag e, from Whom we receive the law that presides over our destin y, and Whose judgment we await. It is His love that inspires us in our acts of charit y: it is His ju stice that governs our justice, and that of societ y and the laws. We continual ly remind ourselves that He is infinite ; because otherwise we should degrade His nature: but He would be for us as if He were not, if His infinite nature had not forms inherent in ourselves, the forms of our own reason and soul. When we love Truth, Justice, and Nobility of Soul, we should know that it is God we love underneath these special forms, and should unite them all into one great act of total piety. We should feel that we go in and out continual ly in the midst of the vast forces of the Universe, which are onl y the Forces of God; that in our studies, when we attain a truth, we confront the thought of God; when we learn the right, we learn the will of God laid down as a rule of conduct for the Universe; and when we feel disinterested love, we should know that we partake the feeling of the Infinite God. Then, when we reverence the mighty Page 507 of 621"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike cosmic force, it will not be a blind Fate in an Atheistic or Pantheistic world, but the Infinite God, that we shall confront and feel and know. Then we shall be mindfu l of the mind of God, conscious of God 's conscience, sensible of His sentiments, and our own existence will be in the infinite being of God. The world is a whole, which has its harmon y; for a God w ho is One, could make none but a comple te and harmonious work. The harmon y of the Universe respond s to the unit y of God, as the indefini te quantit y is the defective sign of the infinitude of God. To say that the Universe is God, is to ad mit the world onl y, and deny God. Give it what name you please, it is atheism at bottom. On the other hand, to suppo se that the Universe is void of God, and that He is wholly apart from it, is an insupportable and al- most impossible abstraction. To distinguish is not to separate. I distinguish, but do not separate myself from my qualities and effects. So God is not the Universe, although He is every where present in spirit and in truth. To us, as to Plato, absolute truth is in God. It is God Himself under one of Hi s phases. In God, as their original, are the immutable principles of realit y and cognizance. In Him things receive at once their existence and their intel ligibility. It is by particip ating in the Divine reason that our own reason po ssesses s omething of the Ab solute. Every judgmen t of reason envelopes a necessar y truth, and every necessar y truth suppose s the necessar y Existence. Thus, from every direction, – from metaphysics, æsthetics, and mora lity above all, we rise to the same Principle, the common centre, and ultim ate foundation of all truth, all beauty, all good. The True, the Beautiful, the Good, are but diverse revelations of one and the same Being. Thus we reach the threshold of religion, and are in com munion with the great philosophies which all proclai m a God; and at the same time with the religions which cover the earth, and all repose on the sacred foundation of natural religion; of that religion which reveals to us the natural light given to all men, without the aid of a particular revelation. So long as philosoph y does not arrive at religion, it is below all worships, even the most imperfect; for the y at least give man a Father, a Witness, a Consoler, a Judge. By religion, philosophy connects itself with humani ty, which, from one end of the world to the other, aspires to God, believes in God, hopes in God. Philosophy contains in itself the common basis of all religious beliefs; it, as it were, borrows from them their principle, and returns it to them surrounded with light, elevated above uncertaint y, secure against all attack. From the necessit y of His Nature, the Infinite Being must create and preserve the Finite, and to the Finite must, in its forms, give and com municate of His own kind. We cannot conceive of any finite thing existing without God, the Infinite basis and ground thereof; nor of God existing without something. God is the necessary logical condition of a world, its necessitating cause; a world, the necessary logical condition of God, His necessitated consequence. It is according to His Infinite Perfection to create, and then to preserve and bless whatever He creates. That is the conclusion of modern metaph ysical science. The stream of philosoph y runs down from Aristotle to Hegel, and breaks off with this conclusion: and then again recurs the ancient difficult y. If it be of Hi s nature to create, – if we cannot conceive of His existing alone , without creating, without having created, then Page 508 of 621"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike what He created was co-existent with Himself. If He could exist an instant without creating, He could as well do so for a myriad of eternities. And so again co mes round to us the old doctrine of a God, the Soul of the Universe, and co-existent with it. For what He created had a beginning ; and however long since that creation occurred, an eternit y had before elapsed. The difference between a beginning and no beginning is infinite. But of some things we can be certain. We are conscious of ourselves – of our selves if not as substances, at least as Powers to be, to do, to suffer. We are conscious of ourselves not as self-originated at all or as self- sustained alone; but only as dependent, first for existence, ever since for support. Among the primar y ideas of consciousness, that are inseparable from it, the ato ms of self- consciousness, we find the idea of God. Carefull y examined by the scrutiniz ing intellect, it is the idea of God as infinite, perfectl y powerful, wise, just, loving, hol y; absolute being with no limi tation. This made us, made all, sustains us, sustains all; made our bod y, not by a single act, but by a series of acts extending over a vast succession of y ears, – for man's body is the resultant of all created things, – made our spirit, our mind, conscience, affections, soul, will, appointed for each its natural mode of action, set each at its several aim. Thus self-consciousness leads us to consciousnes s of God, and at last to consciousness of an infinite God. That is the highest evidence of our own existence, and it is the highest evidence of His. If there is a God at all, He must be omnipresen t in space. Beyond the last Stars He must be, as He is here. There can be no mot e that peoples the sunbeams, no little cell of life that the microscope discovers in the seed- sporule of a moss, but He is there. He must also be omnipresen t in time. There was no second of ti me before the Stars began to burn, but God wa s in that second. In the most distant nebulous spot in Orion' s belt, and in every one of the millions that people a square inch of limestone, God is alike present. He is in the smal lest imaginab le or even unimag inable portion of time, and in every second of its most vast and uni maginab le volume; His Here conterm inous with the All of Space, His Now coeval with the All of Tim e. Through all this Space, in all this Tim e, His Being extends, spreads undivided, operates unspent; God in all His infinit y, perfectl y powerful, wise, ju st, loving, and holy. His being is an infinite activity, a creating, and so a giving of Himse lf to the World. The World's being is a becoming , a being created and continued. It is so now, and was so, incalculabl e and unimagin able millions of ages ago. All this is philosophy , the unavoidable conclusion of the human mind. It is not the opinion of Coleridge and Kant, but their science ; not what the y gues s , but what they know . In virtue of this in-dwelling of God in matter, we say that the world is a revelation of Him, its existence a show of Hi s. He is in His work. The man ifold action of the Universe is only His mode of operation, and all material things are in com munion with Him. All grow and move and live in Him, and by means of Him, and onl y so. Let Him withdraw from the space occupied by anything, and it ceases to be. Let Him withdraw an y quality of His Page 509 of 621"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike nature from anything, and it ceases to be. All must partake of Him, He dwelling in each, and yet transcending all. The failure of fanciful religion to become philosophy , does not preclude philosophy from coinciding with true religion. Philosophy , or rather its object, the divine order of the Universe, is the intellectual guide which the religious sentiment needs; while exploring the real relations of the finite, it obtains a constantl y improving and self-correcting measure of the perfect law of the Gospel of Love and Liberty, and a me ans of carry ing into effect the spiritualis m of revealed religion. It establishes law, by ascertaining its terms; it guides the spirit to see its way to the amelioration of life and the increase of happiness. While religion was stationar y, science could not walk alone; when both are adm itted to be progressive, their interests and aims become identified. Aristotle began to show how religion may be founded on an intellec tual basis; but the basis he laid was too narrow. Bacon, b y giving to philosoph y a definite aim and method, gave it at the same time a safer and self-enlarging basis. Our position is that of intel lectual beings surrounded by limitations; and the latter being constant, have to intelligenc e the practical value of laws, in who se investigat ion and application consists that seemingly endless career of intellectu al and moral progres s which the sentim ent of religion inspires and ennobles. The title of Saint has com monly been claimed for those whose boast it has been to despise philosophy ; yet faith will stumble and sentiment mislead, unless knowledge be present, in a mount and quality sufficient to purif y the one and to give beneficia l direction to the other. Science consists of those matured inferences from experience which all other experience confirms. It is no fixed system superior to revision, but that progressive mediation between ignorance and wisdom in part conceived by Plato, whose im mediate object is happiness, and its impulse the highest kind of love. Science realizes and unites all that was truly valuable in both the old schem es of media tion; the heroic, or system of action and effort; and the mystical theory of spiritual, contemplative communion. \"Listen to me,\" says Galen, \"as to the voice of the Eleusinian Hierophant, and believe that the study of nature is a mystery no less import ant than theirs, nor les s adapted to display the wisdom and power of the Great Creator. Their lessons and demonstra tions were obscure, but ours are clear and unmistakable.\" To science we owe it that no man is any longer entit led to consider himse lf the central point around which the whole Universe of life and motion revolves – the immensely important individual for whose convenience and even luxurious ease and indulgence the whole Universe was made. On one side it has sho wn us an infinite Universe of stars and suns and worlds at incalcul able distances from each other, in whose majestic and awful presence we sink and even our world sinks into insignificance ; while, on the other side, the microscope has placed us in com munication with new worlds of organized livings beings, gifted with senses, nerves, appetites, and instincts, in ever y tear and in ever y drop of putrid water. Thus science teaches us that we are but an infinitesim al portion of a great whole, that stretches out on ever y side of us, and above and below us, infinite in its compl ications, and which infinite wisdom alone .can co mprehend. Infinite wisdom has arranged the infinite succession of beings, involving the necessit y of birth, decay, and death, and made the Page 510 of 621"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike loftiest virtues pos sible by providing those conflicts, reverses, trials, and hardships, without which even their names could never have been invented. Knowledge is convertibl e into power, and axioms into rules of utilit y and dut y. Modern science is social and com municative. It is mora l as well as intellec tual; powerful, y et pacific and disinterested; binding man to man as well as to the Universe; filling up the details of obligat ion, and cherishing impulses of virtue, and, by affording clear proof of the consistenc y and identit y of all interests, substituting co-operation for rivalr y, liberali ty for jealousy , and tending far more powerfull y than an y other means to realize the spirit of religion, by healing those inveterate disorders which, traced to their real origin, will be found rooted in an ignorant assumption as to the penurious severit y of Providence, and the consequent greed of selfish men to confine what seemed as if extorted from it to themselves, or to steal from each other rather than quietly to enjoy their own. We shall probabl y never reach those higher forms containing the true differences of things, involving the full discovery and correct expression of their ver y self or essence. We shall ever fall short of the most general and most simple nature, the ultimate or most comprehensive law. Our wide st axioms explain many phenomen a, but so too in a degree did the principles or elements of the old philosophers, and the cycles and epic ycles of ancient astronom y. We cannot in any case of causation assign the whole of the conditions, nor though we may reproduce them in practice, can we men tally distinguish them all, without knowing the essences of the things including them; and we therefore must not unconsciousl y ascribe that absolute certain ty to axio ms, which the ancient religionists did to creeds, nor allow the mind, which ever strives to insulate itself and its acquisitions, to forget the nature of the process by which it substituted scientific for com mon notions, and so with one as with the other lay the basis of self-deception by a pedantic and superstitious employment of them. Doubt, the essential preliminary of all improve ment and discovery , must accompan y all the stages of m an's onward progress. Hi s intellectual life is a perpetual beginning, a preparation for a birth. The facult y of doubting and questioning, without which those of comparison and judgment would be useless, is itself a divine prerogative of the reason. Knowledge is alwa ys imperfe ct, or comp lete only in a prospectivel y boundless career, in which discovery multiplies doubt, and doubt leads on to new discovery . The boast of science is not so much its man ifested results, as its adm itted imperf ection and capacit y of unlimited progress. The true religious philosophy of an imperfec t being is not a s ystem of creed, but, as Socrates thought, an infinite search or approxima tion. Finality is but another name for bewilder ment or defeat. Science gratifies the religious feeling without arresting it, and opens out the unfatho mable mystery of the One Supreme into mor e explicit and manageable Forms, which express not indeed His Essence, which is wholly beyond our reach and higher than our faculti es can climb, but His Will, and so feeds an endless enthusias m by accumulating forever new ob jects of pursuit. We have long experienced that knowledge is profitable, we are beginning to find out that it is mora l, and we shall at last discover it to be religious.

The mists of error thickened under the shadow s of prescription, until the free light again broke in upon the night of ages, redee ming the genuine treasure from the superstition which obstinatel y doted on its accessories. Even to the Barbarian, Nature reveals a mighty power and a wondrous wisdom, and continual ly points to God. It is no w onder that men worshipped the several things of the world. The world of mat ter is a revelation of fear to the savage in Northern climes; he trembles at his deit y throned in ice and sno w. The lightning, the storm, the earthquake startle the rude man, and he sees the divine in the extraordinar y. The grand objects of Nature perpetual ly constrain men to think of their Author. The Alps are the great altar of Europe; the nocturnal sky has been to m ankind the dome of a temp le, starred all over with admon itions to reverence, trust, and love. The Scriptures for the human race are writ in earth and Heaven. No organ or miser ere touches the heart like the sonorous s well of the sea or the ocean- wave's immeasurab le laugh. Every year the old world puts on new bridal beauty, and celebrat es its Whit- Sunday , when in the sweet Spring each bush and tree dons reverentl y its new glories. Autumn is a long All-Saints' day ; and the harvest is Hallowm ass to Mankind. Before the human race marched down from the slopes of the Himala yas to take possession of Asia, Chaldea, and Egypt, men marked each annual crisis, the solstices and the equinoxes, and celebrated religious festivals therein; and even then, and ever since, the ma terial was and has been the element of comm union between man and God. Nature is full of religious lessons to a thoughtful man. He dissolves the matter of the Universe, leaving only its forces; he dissolves away the phenomena of human history, leaving only immortal spirit; he studies the law, the mode of action of these forces and this spirit, which mak e up the material and the human world, and cannot fail to be filled with reverence, with trust, with boundles s love of the Infinite God, w ho devised these laws of matter and of mind, and thereb y bears up this marv ellous Universe of things and men. Science has its New Testa ment; and the beatitudes of Philosoph y are profoundl y touching. An undevout astronomer is mad. Familiarity with the grass and the trees teaches us deeper lessons of love and trust than we can glean from the writings of Fénélon and Augu stine. The great Bible of God is ever open before mankind. The eternal flowers of Heaven seem to shed sweet influence on the perishable blossoms of the earth.

Affection, friendship, philanthrop y, will be but the wild fancies of the monom aniac, fit subjects for smiles or laughter or for pity .

Beautiful around stretches off ever y way the Universe, the Great Bible of God. Material nature is its Old Testam ent, millions of years old, thick with eternal truths under our feet, glittering with everlasting glories over our heads; and Human Nature is the New Testam ent from the Infinite God, every day revealing a new page as Tim e turns over the leaves. Immortality stands waiting to give a recomp ense for ever y virtue not rewarded, for ever y tear not wiped awa y, for every sorrow undeserved, for ever y prayer, for ever y pure intention and emot ion of the heart. And over the whole, over Nature, Material and Human, over this Mortal Life and over the eternal Past and Future, the infinite Loving-kindness of God the Father com es enfolding all and blessing everything that ever was, that is, that ever shall be. Everything is a thought of the Infinite God. Nature is His prose, and man His Poetry. There is no Chance, no Fate; but God' s Great Providence, enfolding the whole Universe in its bosom, and feeding it with everlasting life. In times past there has been evil which we cannot understand; now there are evils which we cannot solve, nor make square with God 's perfect goodness by any theory our feeble intellec t enables us to frame. There are sufferings, follies, and sins for all mankind, for every nation, for ever y man and every woman. They were all foreseen by the infinite wisdom of God, all provided for by His infinite power and ju stice, and all are consistent with His infinite love.

Then indeed we might despairingl y unite in that horrible utterance of Heine: \"Alas, God's Satire weighs heavil y on me! The Great Author of the Universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven, is bent on demonstr ating, with crushing force, to me, the little, earthly, German Aristophanes, how m y wittiest sarcasms are onl y pitiful attempts at jesting, in comparison with His, and how miserably I am beneath Him, in humor, in colossal mo ckery.\" No, no! God is not thus amused with and prodigal of human suffering. The world is neither a Here without a Hereafter, a body without a soul, a chaos with no God; nor a body blasted by a soul, a Here with a worse Hereafter, a world with a God that hates more than half the creatures He has made. There is no Savage, Revengeful, and Evil God: but there is an Infinite God, seen ever ywhere as Perfect Cause, every where as Perfect Providence, transcending all, yet in-dwelling everywhere, with perfect power, wisdom, justice, holiness, and love, providing for the future welfare of each and all, foreseeing and forecaring for ever y bubble that breaks on the great stream of human life and human history. The end of man and the object of existence in this world, being not only happiness, but happiness in virtue and through virtue, virtue in this world is the condition of happiness in another life, and the condition of virtue in this world is suffering, more or less frequent, briefer or longer continued, more or less intense. Take away suffering, and there is no longer any resignation or human ity, no more self-sacrifice, no more devotedness, no more heroic virtues, no more sublim e morality. We are subjected to suffering, both because we are sensible, and because we ought to be virtuous. If there were no ph ysical evil, there would be no possible virtue, and the world would be badly adapted to the destin y of man. The apparent disorders of the ph ysical world, and the evils that result from them, are not disorders and evils that occur despite the power and goodness of G od. God not onl y allows, but wills the m. It is His will that there shall be in the physical world causes enough of pain for man, to afford him occasions for resignation and courage. Whatever is favorable to virtue, whatever gives the moral liberty more energy, whatever can serve the greater moral developmen t of the human race, is good. Suffering is not the worst condition of man on earth. The worst condition is the moral brutalizat ion which the absence of physical evil would engender. External or internal physical evil connects itself with the object of existence, which is to accomplish the mora l law here below, whatever the consequences, with the firm hope that virtue unfortunate will not fail to be rewarded in another life. The moral law has its sanction and its reason in itself. It owes nothing to that law of mer it and demeri t that accompanies it, but is not its basis. But, though the principle of merit and demeri t ought not to be the determ ining principle of virtuous action, it powerfull y concurs with the moral law, because it offers virtue a legiti mate ground of consolation and hope. Moralit y is the recognition of duty, as duty , and its acco mplishment, whatever the consequences. Page 514 of 621"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Religion is the recognition of duty in its necessary harmon y with goodnes s; a harmon y that must have its realiz ation in another life, through the justice and omnipo tence of God. Religion is as true as moral ity; for once mora lity is admi tted, its consequences must be admitted. The whole mora l existence is included in these two words, harmonious with each other: DUTY and H OPE. Masonry teaches that God is infinit ely good. What motive, what reason, and, mora lly speaking, what possibility can there be to Infinite Power and Infinite Wisdom, to be anything but good? Our very sorrows, proclaim ing the loss of ob jects inexpressibly dear to us, demonstra te His Goodnes s. The Being that made us intellig ent cannot Himself be without intellig ence; and He Who has mad e us so to love and to sorro w for what we love, must number love for the creatures He has mad e, among His infinite attributes. Amid all our sorrow s, we take refuge in the assurance that He loves us; that He does not capriciousl y, or through indifference, and still less in mer e anger, grieve and afflict us; that He chastens us, in order that by His chastise ments, which are by His universal law onl y the consequences of our acts, we ma y be profited; and that He could not show s o much love for His creatures, by leaving them unchastened, untried, undisciplined. We have faith in the Infinite; faith in God's Infinite Love; and it is that faith that must save us. No dispensations of God' s Providence, no suffering or bereave ment is a messenger of wrath: none of its circu mstances are indications of God 's Anger. He is incapable of Anger; higher above an y such feelings than the distant stars are above the earth. Bad men do not die because God hates them. They die because it is best for the m that they should do so; and, bad as they are, it is better for them to be in the hands of the infinitel y good God, than anywhere else. Darkness and gloom lie upon the paths of m en. They stumble at difficult ies, are ensnared by temptations, and perplexed by trouble. They are anxious, and troubled, and fearful. Pain and affliction and sorrow often gather around the steps of their earthly pilgrimage. All this is written indelibl y upon the tablets of the human heart. It is not to be erased; but Ma sonry sees and reads it in a new light. It does not expect these ills and trials and sufferings to be removed from life; but that the great truth will at some time be believed by all men, that they are the means, selected by infinite wisdom, to purify the heart, and to invigorate the soul whose inheritance is immortality, and the world its school. Masonry propagates no creed except its own most simple and Sublime One; that universal religion, taught b y Nature and by Reason. Its Lodges are neither Jewish, Mo slem, nor Christian Temples. It reiterates the precepts of morali ty of all religions. It venerates the character and com mends the teachings of the great and good of all ages and of all countries. It extracts the good and not the evil, the truth, and not the error, from all creeds; and acknowledges that there is much which is good and true in all. Above all the other great teachers of mora lity and virtue, it reveres the character of the Great Master Who, submissive to the will of His and our Father, died upon the Cross. All must admit, that if the world were filled with beings like Him, the great ills of societ y Page 515 of 621"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike would be at once relieved. For all coercion, injury, selfishness, and revenge, and all the wrongs and the greatest sufferings of life, would disappear at once. These human years would be happy; and the eternal ages would roll on in brightness and beaut y; and the still, sad music of Humanity, that sounds through the world, now in the accents of grief, and now in pensive melancholy, would change to anthems, sounding to the March of Time, and bursting out from the heart of the world. If every man were a perfect imitator of that Great, Wise, Good Teacher, clothed with all His faith and all His virtues, how the circle of Life's ills and trials would be narrowed! The sensual passions would assail the heart in vain. Want would no longer successfull y tempt men to act wrongly , nor curiosit y to do rashl y. Ambition, spreading before men its Kingdoms and its Thrones, and offices and honors, w ould cause none to swerve from their great allegian ce. Injury and insult would be shamed by forgiveness. \"Father,\" men would say, \"forgive them; for the y know not what they do.\" None would seek to be enriched at another's loss or expense. Ever y man would feel that the whole human race were his brothers. All sorro w and pain and anguish would be soothed by a perfect faith and an entire trust in the Infinite Goodness of God. The world around us would be new, and the Heavens above us; for here, and there, and everywhere, through all the amp le glories and splendors of the Universe, all men would recognize and feel the presence and the beneficent care of a loving Father. However the Mason may believe as to creeds, and churches, and mira cles, and missions from Heaven, he must admit that the Life and character of Him who taught in Galilee, and fragments of Whose teachings have come down to us, are worthy of all imitation. That Life is an undenied and undeniable Gospel. Its teachings cannot be passed by and discarded. All must admit that it would be happiness to follow and perfection to imitate Him. None ever felt for Him a sincere emotion of contemp t, nor in anger accused Him of sophistry , nor saw immorality lurking in His doctrines; however they may judge of those who succeeded Him, and claim ed to be His apostles. Divine or human, inspired or onl y a reforming Essene, it must be agreed that His teachings are far nobler, far purer, far less allo yed with error and imperfe ction, far less of the earth earthl y, than those of Socrates, Plato, Seneca, or Mahome t, or any other of the great mora lists and Reformers of the world. If our ai ms went as compl etely as His bey ond personal care and selfish gratificat ion; if our thoughts and word s and actions were as entirel y employed upon the great work of benefiting our kind – the true work which we have been placed here to do – as His were; if our nature were as gentle and as tender as His; and if societ y, country , kindred, friendship, and home were as dear to us as they were to Him, we should be at once relieved of more than half the difficulti es and the diseased and painful affections of our lives. Simple obedience to rectitude, instead of self-interest; simple self-culture and self-improv ement, instead of constant cultivat ion of the good opinion of others; single- hearted aims and purposes, instead of improper objects, sought and approached by devious and crooked ways, would free our med itations of man y disturbing and irritating questions. Not to renounce the nobler and better affections of our natures, nor happiness, nor our j ust dues of love and honor from men; not to vilif y ourselves, nor to renounce our self-respect, nor a just and reasonable sense of our meri ts and deserts, nor our own righteousness of Page 516 of 621"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike virtue, does Masonry require, nor would our imit ation of Him require; but to renounce our vices, our faults, our passions, our self-flatter ing delusions; to forego all outward advantages, which are to be gained onl y through a sacrifice of our inward integrit y, or by anxious and pett y contrivances and appliances; to choose and keep the better part; to secure that, and let the worst take care of itself; to keep a good con science, and let opinion come and go as it will; to retain a lofty self-respect, and let low self-indulgence go; to keep inward happiness, and let outward advantages hold a subordinate place; to renounce our selfishness, and that eternal anxiety as to what we are to have, and what men think of us; and be content with the plenitude of God' s great mercies, and so to be happy. For it is the inordinate devotion to self, and consideration of self, that is ever a stumbling- block in the way; that spreads questions, snares, and difficulties around us, darkens the wa y of Providence, and mak es the world a far less happy one to us than it might be. As He taught, so Masonry teaches, affection to our kindred, tenderness to our friends, gentleness and forbearance toward our inferiors, pit y for the suffering, forgiveness of our enemies; and to wear an affectionate nature and gentle disposition as the garm ent of our life, investing pain, and toil, and agon y, and even death, with a serene and hol y beauty . It does not teach us to wrap ourselves in the garments of reserve and pride, to care nothing for the world because it cares nothing for us, to withdraw our thoughts from society because it does us not justice, and see how patientl y we can live within the confines of our own bosoms, or in quiet communion, through books, with the mighty dead. No man ever found peace or light in that way. Every relation, of hate, scorn, or neglect, to mankind, is full of vexation and tor ment. There is nothing to do with men but to love them, to admir e their virtues, pity and bear with their faults, and forgive their injuries. To hate your adversar y will not help you; to kill him will help you still less: nothing within the compass of the Universe will help you, but to pity, forgive, and love him. If we posse ssed His gentle and affection ate disposition, His love and compassion for all that err and all that offend, ho w many difficulti es, both within and without us, would the y relieve! How man y depressed minds should we console! How man y troubles in societ y should we compose! How man y enmities soften! How man y a knot of m ystery and misunderst anding would be untied by a single word, spoken in simp le and confiding truth! How man y a rough path would be mad e smooth, and how many a crooked path be made straight! Very many places, now solitar y, would be mad e glad; very many dark places be filled with light. Moralit y has its axio ms, like the other sciences; and these axioms are, in all languages, justly termed moral truths. Moral truths, considered in themse lves, are equally as certain as mathematical truths. Given the idea of a deposit, the idea of keeping it faithfull y is attached to it as necessaril y, as to the idea of q, triangle is attach ed the idea that its three angles are equal to two right angles. You may violate a deposit; but in doing so, do not imagin e that you change the nature of things, or make what is in itself a deposit becom e your own propert y. The two ideas exclude each other. You have but a false semblance of propert y: and all the efforts of the passions, all the sophisms of interest, will not overturn essential differences. Therefore it is that a mora l truth is so imperious; because, like all truth, it is what it is, and shapes itself to please no caprice. Always the same, and always present, little as we ma y like it, it inexorabl y condemns, with a voice always heard, but not alwa ys Page 517 of 621"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike regarded, the insensate and guilty will which thinks to prevent its existing, by denying, or rather by pretending to deny, its existence. The moral truths are distinguished from other truths by this singular characteristi c: so soon as we perceive them, they appear to us as the rule of our conduct. If it is true that a deposit is made in order to be returned to its legitim ate possessor, it must be returned. To the necessit y of believ ing the truth, the necessit y of practising it is added. The necessit y of practising the mora l truths is obligation. The moral truths, necessar y to the eye of reason, are obligator y on the will. The mora l obligation, like the mora l truth which is its basis, is absolute. As necessary truths are not more or less necessary , so obligation is not more or less obligatory . There are degrees of importan ce among different obligations; but there are no degrees in the obligation itself . One is not nearly obliged, almost obliged; but wholly so, or not at all . If there be any place of refuge against the obligation, it ceases to exist. If the obligation is absolute , it is immutable and universal . For if what is obligation to-day may not be so to-morrow , if what is obligator y for me may not be so for you , the obligation differing from itself, it would be relativ e and contingent. This fact of absolute, immutable, universal obligation is certain and man ifest. The good is the foundation of obligation. If it be not, obligation has no foundation; and that is impossible. If one act ought to be done, and another ought not, it must be because evidentl y there is an essential difference between the two acts. If one be not good and the other bad, the obligat ion imposed on us is arbitrar y. To make the Good a consequence , of any thing whatever, is to annihilate it. It is the first, or it is nothing. When we ask an honest m an why, despite his urgent necessities, he has respected the sanctity of a deposit, he answers, because it was his duty . Asked why it was his duty, he answers, because it was right , was just , was good . Beyond that there is no answer to be made, but there is also no question to be asked. No one perm its a duty to be imposed on him without giving himself a reason for it: but when it is admitted that the dut y is commanded by justice, the mind is satisfied; for it has arrived at a principle beyond which there is nothing to seek, justice being its own principle. The pri mary truths include their own reason: and justice, the essential distinct ion between good and evil, is the first truth of moral ity. Justice is not a consequence ; because we cannot ascend to any principle above it. Moral truth forces itself on man, and does not emanate from him . It no more becomes subjective, by appearing to us obligator y, than truth does by appearing to us necessary . It is in the ver y nature of the true and the good that we must seek for the reason of necessit y and obligation. Obligation is founded on the necessary distinction between the good and the evil; and it is itself the foundation of libert y. If man has his duties to perform, he must have the faculty of acco mplishing them, of resisting desire, passion, and interest, in order to obey the law. He must be free; therefore he is so, or human nature is in contradic tion with itself. The certaint y of the obligation involves the corresponding certain ty of free will . It is the will that is free: though somet imes that will may be ineffectual. The power to do must not be confounded with the power to will . The former may be limited : the latter is Page 518 of 621"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike sovereign . The external effec ts may be prevented: the resolution itself cannot. Of this sovereign power of the will we are conscious. We feel in ourselves, before it becomes determinate, the force which can deter mine itself in one way or another. At the same time when I will this or that, I am equally conscious that I can will the contrary . I am conscious that I am the mast er of my resolution: that I may check it, continue it, retake it. When the act has ceased, the consciousness of the power which produced if has not . That consciousness and the power remain, superior to all the manifestations of the power. Wherefore free-will is the essential and ever- subsisting attribute of the will itself. At the same time that we judge that a free agent has done a good or a bad act, we form another judgment, as necessar y as the first; that if he has done well, he deserves compensation ; if ill, punishmen t. That judgment may be expressed in a manner more or less vivid, according as it is mingled with senti ments more or less ardent. Sometimes it will be a merel y kind feeling toward a virtuous agent, and moder ately hostile to a guilty one; sometimes enthusias m or indignation. The judgment of merit and dem erit is intim ately connected with the judgment of good and evil. Merit is the natural right which we have to be rewarded; demerit the natural right which others have to punish u s. But whether the reward is received, or the punishmen t undergone, or not, the merit or demer it equally subsists. P unishmen t and reward are the satisfaction of merit and demeri t, but do not constitute them. Take away the former, and the latter continue. Take away the latter, and there are no longer real rewards or punishments. When a base man encomp asses our merited honors, he has obtained but the mere appearance of a reward; a mere material advantage. The reward is essentiall y moral; and its value is independent of its form. One of those simple crowns of oak with which the earl y Romans rewarded heroism, was of more real value than all the wealth of the world, when it was the sign of the gratitude and admiration of a people. Reward accorded to merit is a debt; without merit it is an alms or a theft. The Good is good in itself, and to be accomp lished, whatever the consequences. The results of the Good cannot but be fortunate. Happiness, separated from the Good, is but a fact to which no moral idea is attach ed. As an effect of the Good, it enters into the mor al order, comple tes and crowns it. Virtue without happiness, and crim e without misery, is a contradiction and disorder. If virtue suppose sacrifice (that is, suffering), eternal justice requires that sacrifice generously accepted and courageousl y borne, shall have for its reward the same happiness that was sacrificed: and it also requires that crime shall be punished with unhappiness, for the guilty happiness which it attempted to procure. This law that attaches pleasure and sorro w to the good and the evil, is, in general, accomplished even here below. For order rules in the world; because the world lasts. Is that order sometimes disturbed? A re happiness and sorro w not always distributed in legiti mate proportion to crime and virtue? The absolute judgment of the Good, the absolute judgment of obligation, the absolute judgment of merit and demer it, continue to subsist, inviolable and imprescrip tible; and we cannot help but believe that He Who has implan ted in us the sentiment and idea of order, cannot therein Himself be wanting; and that He will, sooner or Page 519 of 621"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike later, re-establish the hol y harmony of virtue and happiness, b y means belonging to Himself. The Judgment of the Good, the decision that such a thing is goad, and that such another is not, – this is the primitive fact, and reposes on itself. By its intimate resemblan ces to the judgment of the true and the beautiful, it shows us the secret affinities of mora lity, metaphysics, and esthetics. The good, so especiall y united to the true, is distinguished from it, only because it is truth put in practice. The good is obligator y. These are two indivisibl e but not identica l ideas. The idea of obligation reposes on the idea of the Good. In this intimate alliance, the former borrows from the latter its universal and absolute character. The obligator y good is the moral law. That is the foundation of all morality. By it we separate ourselves from the mora lity of interest and the morality of sentiment. We admit the existence of those facts, and their influence; but we do not assign the m the same rank. To the mora l law, in the reason of m an, corresponds libert y in action. Liberty is deduced from obligation, and is a fact irresistibl y evident. Man, as free, and subject to obligation, is a moral person; and that involves the idea of rights. To these ideas is added that of meri t and demeri t; which supposes the distinct ion between good and evil, obligation and libert y; and creates the idea of reward and punishmen t. The sentim ents play no unimportan t part in mora lity. All the moral judgments are accompanied by sentiments that respond to them. From the secret sources of enthusiasm the human will draws the m ysterious virtue that makes heroes. Truth enlightens and illumines. Sentim ent warms and inclines to action. Interest also bears its part; and the hope of happiness is the work of G od, and one of the mo tive powers of human action. Such is the admirable econom y of the moral constitution of man. His Supreme Object, the Good: his law, Virtue, which often imposes upon him suffering, thus mak ing him to excel all other created beings known to us. But this law is harsh, and in contradic tion with the instinctiv e desire for happiness. Wherefore the Beneficen t Author of his being has placed in his soul, by the side of the severe law of duty , the sweet, delightful force of sentim ent. Generall y he attaches happiness to virtue; and for the exceptions, for such there are, he has placed Hope at the end of the journey to be travell ed. Thus there is a side on which morality touches religion. It is a sublime necessity of Humani ty to see in God the Legislator supremely wise, the Witness always present, the infallible judge of virtue. The human mind, ever cli mbing up to God, would deem the foundations of moral ity too unstable, if it did not place in God the first principle of the moral law. Wishing to give to the moral law a religious character, we run the risk of taking from it its moral character. We may refer it so entirel y to God a s to make His will an arbitrar y degree. But the will of God, whence we deduce morality, in order to give it authorit y, itself has no mora l authorit y, except as it is ju st. The Good comes from the will of God alone; but from His will, in so far as it is the expression of His wisdom and justice. The Eternal Justice of God is the sole foundation of Justice, such as Humanity perceives and practises it. The Good, dut y, merit and demer it, are referred to God, as every thing is referred to him; but they have none the less a proper evidence and authorit y. Religion is the crown of Moralit y, not its base. The base of Morality is in itself.

To the requisitions of the law of Nature and the law of God, it adds the imperative obligation of a con-tract. Upon entering the Order, the Initiate binds to himself every Mason in the world.

Masonry holds him also, by his solemn promise, to a purer life, a nobler generosity , a more perfect charity of opinion and action; to be tolerant, catholic in his love for his race, ardent in his zeal for the interest of mankind, the advancem ent and progress of humanit y. Such are, we think, the Philosophy and the Moralit y, such the TRUE WORD of a Master Mason. The world, the ancients believed, was governed b y Seven Secondar y Causes; and these were the universal forces, known to the Hebrews by the plural name ELOHIM. These forces, analogous and contrar y one to the other, produce equilibriu m by their contrasts, and regulate the move ments of the spheres. The Hebrews called them the Seven great Archangels, and gave the m names, each of which, being a combina tion of another word with AL, the first Phœnician Nature- God, considered as the Principle of Light, represented them as His manifest ations. Other peoples assigned to these Spirits the governm ent of the Seven Planets then known, and gave the m the names of their great divinities. So, in the Kabala, the last Seven Sephiroth constituted ATIK Y OMIN, the Ancient of Days; and these, as well as the Seven planets, correspond with the Seven colors separated by the prism, and the Seven notes of the musica l octave. Seven is the sacred number in all theogonies and all symbols, because it is composed of 3 and 4. It represents the magical. power in its full force. It is the Spirit assisted b y all the Elementary Powers, the Soul served by Nature, the Holy Empire spoken of in the clavicules of Solomon, symbolized by a warrior, crowned, bearing a triangle on his cuirass, and standing on a cube, to which are harnessed two Sphinxes, one white and the other black, pulling contrar y ways, and turning the head to look backward.

The Kabalistic book of the Apocaly pse is represented as closed with Seven Seals. In it we find the Seven genii of the Ancient Mythologies; and the doctrine concealed under its emblems is the pure Kabala, already lost by the Pharisees at the advent of the Saviour. The pictures that follow in this wondrou s epic are so many pantacles, of which the numbers 3, 4, 7, and 12 are the keys. The Cherub, or s ymbolic bull, which Moses places at the gate of the Edenic world, holding a blazing sword, is a Sphinx, with the bod y of a bull and a human head; the old Assyrian Sphinx whereof the comba t and victory of Mithras were the hierogl yphic analysis. This armed Sphinx represents the law of the Mystery, which keeps watch at the door of initiation, to repulse the Profane. It also represents the grand Magical Mystery, all the elements whereof the numb er 7 expresses, still without giving its last word. This \"unspeakable word \" of the Sages of the school of Alexandria, this word, which the Hebrew Kabalists wrote; יהוה [IHUH], and translated by אראריתא , [ARARITA,] s o expressing the threefoldness of the Secondary Principle, the dualism of the m iddle ones, and the Unit y as well of the first Principle as of the end; and also the junction of the number 3 with the number 4 in a word composed of four letters, but formed of seven by one triplica te and two repeated, – this word is pronounced Ararita . The vowels in the Greek language are also Seven in number, and were used to designate the Seven planets. Tsadok or Sydyc was the Supreme God in Phœnicia. His Seven Son s were probabl y the Seven Cabiri; and he was the Heptaktis, the God of Seven Ray s. Kronos, the Greek Saturn, Philo makes Sanchoniathon say, had six son s, and by Astarte Seven daughters, the Titanides. The Persians adored Ahura Masda or Ormuzd and the Six Amshaspands, the first three of whom were Lords of the Emp ires of Light, Fire, and Splendor; the Babylonians, Bal and the Gods; the Chinese, Shangti, and the Six Chief Spirits; and the Greeks, Kronos, and the Six great Male Gods, his progeny, Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Ar s, H phaistos, and Hermes; while the female deities were also Seven: Rhea, ē ē wife of Kronos, H r , Ath n , Artemis, Aphrodit, Hestia, and D m t i. In the Orphic ē ē ē ē ē ē ē ē Theogony, Gaia produced the fourteen Titans, Seven male and Seven female, Kronos being the most potent of the males; and as the number Seven appears in these, nine by threes, or the triple triangle, is found in the three Mœraê or Fates, the three Centi man s, ē and the three Cyclop s, offspring of Ouranos and Gaia, or Heaven and Earth. ē The metals, like the colors, were deem ed to be Seven in number, and a me tal and color were assigned to each planet.

Pharaoh saw in his drea m, which Joseph interpreted, Seven ears of wheat on one stalk, full and good, and after them Seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the East wind; and the Seven thin ears devoured the Seven good ears; and Joseph interpreted these to mean Seven years of plent y succeeded by Seven ye ars of famin e.

Hear again the words of an adept, who had profoundl y studied the mysteries of science, and wrote, as the Ancient Oracles spoke, in enigmas; but who knew that the theor y of mechanical forces and of the materiality of the most potent agents of Divinit y, explains nothing, and ought to satisfy no one! Through the veil of all the hieratic and mystic allegories of the ancient dogmas, under the seal of all the sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the worn stones of the ancient temples, and on the blackened face of the sphinx of As syria or Egy pt, in the monstrous or marv ellous pictures which the sacred pages of the Vedas translate for the believers of India, in the strange emb lems of our old books of alchem y, in the ceremon ies of reception practised by all the mysterious Societies, we find the traces of a doctrine, everywhere the same, and ever ywhere carefull y concealed. The occult philosophy seems to have been the nurse or the godmo ther of all religions, the secret lever of all the intellec tual forces, the key of all divine obscurities, and the absolute Queen of Societ y, in the ages when it was exclusivel y reserved for the education of the Priests and Kings. It had reigned in Persia with the Magi, who perished one day , as the masters of the world had perished, for having abused their power. It had endowed India with the most marvellous traditions, and an incredible luxury of poetr y, grace, and terror in its emb lems: it had civili zed Greece by the sounds of the l yre of Orpheus: it hid the principles of all the sciences, and of the whole progression of the human spirit, in the audacious calcul ations of Pythagoras: fable teemed with its miracles; and history , when it undertook to judge of this unknown power, confounded itself with fable: it shook or enfeebled empires by its oracles; made tyrants turn pale on their thrones, and ruled over all minds by means of curiosit y or fear. To this science, said the crowd, nothing is impossible ; it commands the elements, knows the language of the planets, and controls the move ments of the stars; the moon, at its voice, falls, reeking with blood, from Heaven; the dead rise upright on their graves, and shape into fatal words the wind that breathes through their skulls. Controller of Love or Hate, this science can at pleasure confer on hum an hearts Paradise or Hell: it disposes at will of all forms, and distributes beauty or deformi ty as it pleases: it changes in turn, with the rod of Circe, men into brutes and ani mals into men : it even disposes of Life or of Page 523 of 621"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Death, and can bestow on its adepts riches by the transmu tation of metals, and immortality by its quintessence and elixir, compounded of gold and light. This is what magic had been, from Zoroaster to Manes, from Orpheus to Apollonius Thyaneus; when positive Christianit y, triumphing over the splendid dreams and gigantic aspirations of the school of Alexandria, publicl y crushed this philosophy with its anathemas, and compe lled it to become more occult and more mysterious than ever. At the bottom of magi c, nevertheless, was science, as at the bottom of Christianit y there was love; and in the Evangelic Symbols we see the incarnat e WORD adored in its infanc y by three magi whom a star guides (the ternar y and the sign of the microcos m), and receiving from them gold frankincense, and myrrh; another mysterious ternary , under the emblem whereof are allegori cally contained the highest secrets of the Kabala. Christianit y should not have hated magic; but human ignorance always fears the unknown. Science was obliged to conceal itself, to avoid the impassioned aggressions of a blind love. It enveloped itself in new hierogl yphs, conceal ed its efforts, disguised its hopes. Then was created the jargon of alchem y, a continual deception for the vulgar herd, greedy of gold, and a living language for the true disciples of Hermes alone. Resorting to Masonry , the alche mists there invented Degrees, and partl y unveiled their doctrine to their Initiates; not by the language of their receptions, but by oral instruction afterward; for their rituals, to one who has not the key, are but inco mprehensib le and absurd jargon. Among the sacred books of the Christians are two works which the infallible church does not pretend to understand, and never atte mpts to explain, – the prophecy of Ezekiel and the Apocal ypse; two cabalisti c clavicul es, reserved, no doubt, in Heaven, for the exposition of the Magian kings; closed with Seven seals for all faithful believers; and perfectl y clear to the unbeliever initiated in the occult sciences. For Christians, and in their opinion, the scientifi c and mag ical clavicul es of Solomon are lost. Nevertheless, it is certain that, in the doma in of intell igence governed b y the WORD, nothing that is written is lost. Only those things which men cease to understand no longer exist for them, at least as WORD; then they enter into the doma in of enig mas and mystery. The mysterious founder of the Christian Church was saluted in His cradle by the three Magi, that is to say by the hierati c ambassadors from the three parts of the known world, and from the three analogica l worlds of the occult philosophy . In the school of Alexandria, Magic and Christianit y almost take each other by the hand under the auspices of Ammon ius Saccos and Plato. The dogma of Hermes is found al most entire in the writings attributed to Diony sius the Areopagite. Synesius traces the plan of a treatise on dreams, which was sub sequentl y to be com mented on by Cardan, and composes hymns which might serve for the liturg y of the Church of Swedenborg, if a church of illuminati could have a liturg y. To this epoch of ardent abstractions and impassioned logomachies belongs the philosophical reign of Julian, an illuminatus and Initiat e of the first order, who believed in Page 524 of 621"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike the unity of God and the universal Dogma of the Trinity, and regretted the loss of nothing of the old world but its magnif icent symbols and too graceful images. He was no Pagan, but a Gnostic, infected with the allegori es of Grecian polytheism, and who se misfortune it was to find the name of Jesu s Christ less sonorous than that of Orpheus. We may be sure that so soon as Religion and Philosophy become distinct departm ents, the mental activity of the age is in advance of its Faith; and that, though habit may sustain the latter for a ti me, its vitality is gone. The dunces who led prim itive Christianit y astray, by substituting faith for science, reverie for experience, the fantastic for the realit y; and the inquisitors who for so man y ages waged against Magism a war of exterm ination, have succeeded in shrouding in darkness the ancient discoveries of the human mind; so that we now grope in the dark to find again the key of the phenomen a of nature. But all natural phenomena depend on a single and immutable law, represented by the philosophal stone and its symbolic form, which is that of a cube. This law, expressed in the Kabala b y the number 4, furnished the Hebrews with all the mysteries of their divine Tetragra m. Everything is contained in that word of four letters. It is the Azot of the Alchem ists, the Thot of the Bohemi ans, the Taro of the Kabalists. It supplies to the Adept the last word of the human Sciences, and the Key of the Divine Power: but he alone understands how to avail himself of it who comprehends the necessit y of never revealing it. If Œdipus, in place of slaying the Sph ynx, had conquered it, and driven it into Thebes harnessed to his chariot, he would have been King, without incest, calamities, or exile. If Psyche, by submission and caresses, had persuaded Love to reveal himself, she would never have lost hi m. Love is one of the m ythological images of the grand secret and the grand agent, because it expresses at once an action and a passion, a void and a plenitude, an arrow and a wound. The Initiates ought to understand this, and, lest the profane should overhear, Masonry never says too much. When Science had been overcome in Alexandria by the fanaticism of the murderers of Hypatia, it became Christian, or, rather, it concealed itself under Christian disguises, with Ammonius, Synosius, and the author of the books of Diony sius the Areopagite. Then it was necessary to win the pardon of m iracles by the appearances of superstition, and of science by a language unintelligib le. Hierogl yphic writing was revived, and pantacles and characters were invented, that summed up a whole doctrine in a sign, a whole series of tendencies and revelations in a word. What was the object of the aspirants to knowledge? They sought for the secret of the great work, or the Philosophal Stone, or the perpetual motion, or the squaring of the circle, or the universal medicine; formulas which often saved them from persecution and general ill-will, by exposing them to the charge of foll y; and each of which expressed one of the forces of the grand mag ical secret. This lasted until the time of the Roman de la Rose, which also expresses the m ysterious and mag ical meaning of the poem of Dante, borrowed from the High Kabalah, that immense and concealed source of the universal philosophy . It is not strange that man knows but little of the powers of the human will, and imperfe ctly appreciat es them; since he know s nothing as to the nature of the will and its mode of operation. That his own will can move his arm, or comp el another to obey him; that his Page 525 of 621"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike thoughts, symbolically expressed by the signs of w riting, can influence and lead other men, are mysteries as incomprehensib le to him, as that the will of Deity could effect the creation of a Universe. The powers of the will are as y et chiefly indefinite and unknown. Whether a multitude of well-established phenomen a are to be ascribed to the power of the will alone, or to magnetism or some other natural agent, is a point as yet unsettled; but it is agreed b y all that a concentra ted effort of the will is in every case necessar y to success. That the phenomena are real is not to be doubted, unless credit is no longer to be given to human testimony; and if they are real, there is no reason for doubting the exercise heretofore, by many adepts, of the powers that were then ter med magical. Nothing is better vouched for than the extraordinar y perform ances of the Brahmins. No religion is supported by stronger testimon y; nor has an y one ever even attempted to explain what ma y well be termed their miracles. How far, in this life, the mind and soul can act without and in- dependentl y of the body, no one as yet knows. That the will can act at all without bodily contact, and the phenomen a of dreams, are mysteries that confound the wisest and most learned, whose explanations are but a Babel of words. Man as y et knows little of the forces of nature. Surrounded, controlled, and governed by them, while he vainl y thinks himse lf independent, not only of his race, but the universal nature and her infinite manifold forces, he is the slave of these forces, unless he becomes their master. He can neither ignore their existence nor be simply their neighbor. There is in nature one most potent force, b y means whereof a single man, who could possess himse lf of it, and should know ho w to direct it, could revolutioniz e and change the face of the world. This force was kno wn to the ancients. It is a universal agent, whose Supreme law is equilibriu m; and whereby, if science can but learn how to control it, it will be possible to change the order of the Seasons, to produce in night the pheno mena of day, to send a thought in an instant round the world, to heal or slay at a distance, to give our words universal success, and make them reverberate everywhere. This agent, partial ly revealed by the blind guesses of the disciples of Mesmer, is precisel y what the Adepts of the middle ages called the elementary matter of the great work. The Gnostics held that it composed the igneous body of the Holy Spirit; and it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple, under the hierogl yphic figure of Baphom et or the hermaphrod itic goat of Mendes. There is a Life- Principle of the world, a universal agent, wherein are two natures and a double current, of love and wrath. This amb ient fluid penetrates everything. It is a ra y detached from the glory of the Sun, and fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and the central attraction. It is the body of the Holy Spirit, the universal Agent, the Serpent devouring his own tail. With this electro- magnetic ether, this vital and luminous caloric, the ancients and the alchem ists were fam iliar. Of this agent, that phase of modern ignorance termed physical science talks incoherentl y, knowing naught of it save its effects; Page 526 of 621"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and theology might apply to it all its pretended definitions of spirit. Quiescent, it is appreciabl e by no human sense; disturbed or in movem ent, none can explain its mode of action; and to ter m it a \"fluid,\" and speak of its \"currents,\" is but to veil a profound ignorance under a cloud of words. Force attracts force, life attracts life, health attracts health. It is a law of nature. If two children live together, and still more if they sleep together, and one is feeble and the other strong, the strong will absorb the feeble, and the latter will perish. In schools, some pupils absorb the intell ect of the others, and in ever y circle of men some one individual is soon found, w ho posses ses himse lf of the wills of the others. Enthrall ments by currents is very common; and one is carried away by the crowd, in morals as in ph ysics. The human will has an almost absolute power in deter mining one's acts; and ever y external demonstr ation of a will has an influence on external things. Tissot ascribed most maladies to disorders of the will, or the perverse influences of the wills of others. We beco me subject to the wills of others by the analogies of our inclinations, and still more by those of our defects. To caress the weaknesses of an individual, is to posse ss ourself of hi m, and mak e of him an instrumen t in the order of the same errors or depravations. But when two natures, analogical in defects, are subordinated one to the other, there is effected a kind of substitution of the stronger instead of the weaker, and a genuine imprisonment of one mind by the other. Often the weaker struggles, and would fain revolt; and then falls lower than ever in servitude. We each have some dominant defect, by which the ene my can grasp u s. In some it is vanity, in others indolence, in most egotism. Let a cunning and evil spirit possess himse lf of this, and yo u are lost. Then y ou become, not foolish, nor an idiot, but positively a lunatic, the slave of an impu lse from without. You have an instinct ive horror for everything that could restore y ou to reason, and will not even listen to representations that contravene your insanit y. Miracles are the natural effects of exceptiona l causes. The immediate action of the human will on bodies, or at least this action exercised without visible means, constitutes a miracle in the physical order. The influence exercised on wills or intellec ts, suddenly or within a given ti me, and capable of taking captive the thoughts, changing the firmest resolutions, paral yzing the most violent passions, constitutes a miracle in the mora l order. The common error in relation to miracles is, to regard the m as effects without causes; as contradic tions of nature; as sudden fictions of the Divine im agination; and men do not reflect that a single m iracle of this sort would break the universal har mony and re- plunge the Universe into Chaos. There are miracles impossible to God Himself: absurd mirac les are so. If God could be absurd for a single instant, neither He nor the Universe would exist an instant afterward. Page 527 of 621"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike To expect of the Divine Free-Will an effect whose cause is unacknowledged or does not exist, is what is ter med tempting God. It is to precipita te one's self into the void. God acts b y His work s: in Heaven, by angels; on earth, by men. In the heaven of human conceptions, it is humani ty that creates God; and men think that God has made them in His image, because the y make Him in theirs. The domain of man is all corporeal nature, visible on earth; and if he does not rule the planets or the stars, he can at least calculat e their movement, measure their distances, and identify his will with their influence : he can modify the atmosphere, act to a certain point on the season s, cure and afflict with sickness other men, preserve life and cause death. The absolute in reason and will is the greatest power which it is given to men to attain ; and it is by means of this power that what the mu ltitude admires under the name of mira cles, are effected. POWER is the wise use of the will, which mak es Fatality itself serve to accomp lish the purposes of Sages. Omnipot ence is the most absolute Libert y; and absolute Liberty cannot exist without a perfect equilibriu m; and the colu mns JACHIN and BO AZ are also the unlimited POWER and SPLENDOR O F PERFECTION of the Deity, the seventh and eighth SEPHIROTH of the Kabalah, from whose equilibrium result the eternal perman ence and Stabilit y of His plans and works, and of that perfect Success and undivided, unlimited Dominion, which are the ninth and tenth SEPHIR OTH, and of which the Temple of Solomon, in its statel y symmetry, erected without the sound of an y tool of me tal being heard, is to us a s ymbol. \"For Thine,\" says the Mo st Perfect of Prayers, \"is the DO MINION, the POWER, and the GLORY, during all the ages! Amen!\" The ABSOLUTE is the ver y necessity of BEING, the immutable law of Reason and of Truth. It is THAT WHICH IS. B UT THAT WHIC H IS is in some sort before HE WHO IS. God Himself is not without a reason of existence . He does not exist accidental ly. He could not not have been. His Existence, then, is necessitated , is necessary . He can exist only in virtue of a Supreme and inevitabl e REASON. That REASON, then, is THE ABSOLUTE; for it is in IT we must believe, if we would that our faith should have a reasonable and solid basis. It has been said in our ti mes, that God is a Hy pothesis; but Absolute Reason is not one: it is essential to Existence. Saint Thomas said, \" A thing is not just because God wills it , BUT GOD WILLS IT BECAUSE IT IS JU ST.\" If he had deduced all the consequences of this fine thought, he would have discovered the true Philosopher's Stone; the magica l elixir, to convert all the trials of the world into golden mercies. Precisel y as it is a necessit y for God to BE, so it is a necessity for Him to be ju st, loving, and m erciful. He cannot be unjust, cruel, merciless. He cannot repeal the law of right and wrong, of merit and demer it; for the mor al laws are as absolute as the physical laws. There are impossible things. A s it is impossible to make two and two be five and not four; as it is impossible to make a thing be and not be at the same time; so it is impossible for the Deit y to make crime a merit, and love and gratitude Page 528 of 621"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike crimes. So, too, it was impossible to make Man perfect, with his bodil y senses and appetites, as it was to mak e his nerves susceptible of pleasure and not also of pain. Therefore, according to the idea of Saint Thomas, the moral laws are the enactments of the Divine WILL, only because they are the decisions of the Absolute WISDOM and REASO N, and the Revela tions of the Divine NATURE. In this alone consists the right of Deity to enact them; and thus only do we attain the certaint y in Faith that the Universe is one Harmony. To believe in the Reason of God, and in the God of Reason, is to make Atheism impossibl e. It is the Idolaters who have made the Atheists. Analog y gives the Sage all the forces of Nature. It is the key of the Grand Arcanum, the root of the Tree of Life, the science of Good and Evil. The Absolute, is REASO N. Reason IS, b y means of Itself. It IS BECAUSE IT IS, and not because we suppo se it. IT IS, where nothing exists ; but nothing could possibly exist without IT. Reason is Necessit y, Law, the Rule of all Liberty, and the direction of every Initiative. If God IS, HE IS by Reason. The conception of an Ab solute Deity, outside of, or independent of, Reason, is the IDOL of Black Magic, the PHANTOM of the Dæmon. The Supreme Intelligence is necessaril y rational . God, in philosoph y, can be no more than a Hypothesis; but a H ypothesis imposed by good sen se on Human Reason. To personif y the Absolute Reason, is to determ ine the Divine Ideal. NECESSITY, LIBERTY, and REAS ON! Behold the great and Supreme Triangle of the Kabalists! FATALITY, WILL, and POWER! Such is the magical ternary which, in human things, corresponds with the Divine Triangle. FATALITY is the inevitable linking together, in succession, of effects and causes, in a given order. WILL is the faculty that directs the forces of the Intellec t, so as to reconcile the libert y of persons with the necessit y of things. The argumen t from these premises must be made by yourself. Each one of us does that. \"Seek,\" say the Holy Writings, \"and ye shall find.\" Yet discussion is not forbidden; and without doubt the subject will be fully treated of in your hearing hereafter. Affirma tion, negation, discussion, – it is by these the truth is attained. To explore the great Mysteries of the Universe and seek to solve its man ifold enigmas, is the chief use of Thought, and constitutes the principal distinction between Man and the animals. Accordingl y, in all ages the Intelle ct has labored to understand and explain to itself the Nature of the Supreme Deity. That one Reason and one Will created and governed the Universe was too evident not to be at once adm itted by the philosophers of all ages. It was the ancient religions that sought to multiply gods. The Nature of the One Deit y, and the mode in which the Universe had its Page 529 of 621"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike beginning, are questions that have alwa ys been the racks in which the human intellect has been tortured: and it is chiefl y with these that the Kabalists have dealt. It is true that, in one sense, we can have no actual knowledge of the Absolute Itself, the very Deity. Our means of obtaining what is commonly termed actual knowledge, are our senses only . If to see and feel be knowledge , we have none of our own S oul, of electric ity, of magn etism. We see and feel and taste an acid or an alkali, and know someth ing of the qualities of each; but it is only when we use them in comb ination with other substances, and learn their effec ts , that we reall y begin to know their nature . It is the combina tion and experiments of Chemistr y that give as a knowledge of the nature and powers of most animal and vegetable substances. As these are cognizable by inspection by our sense s, we may partiall y know them by that alone: but the Soul, either of ourself or of another, being beyond that cognizanc e, can only be known by the acts and word s which are its effects. Magnetis m and electr icity, when at rest, are equall y beyond the jurisdiction of the senses; and when the y are in action, we see, feel, hear, taste, and smell only their effects. We do not know what they are , but only what the y do . We can know the attributes of Deity only through His manifestations. To ask an ything more, is to ask, not knowledge , but something else, for which we have no na me. God is a Power; and we know nothing of any Power itself , but onl y its effects, results, and action, and what Reason teaches us by analogy ; In these later days, in laboring to escape from all material ideas in regard to Deit y, we have so refined away our notions of GO D, as to have no idea of Him at all. In struggling to regard Him as a pure immaterial Spirit, we have m ade the word Spirit synonymous with nothing , and can only say that He is a Somewhat , with certain attributes, such as Power, Wisdom, and Intelligen ce. To compare Him to LIGHT, would now be dee med not only unphilosophical, but the equivalent of Atheis m; and we find it necessary to excuse and pit y the ancients for their inadequate and gro ss ideas of Deity , expressed in considering Him as the Light-Principle, the invisible essence or substance from which visible Light flows. Yet our own holy writings continuall y speak of Him as Light; and therefore the Tsabeans and the Kabala may well be pardoned for doing the same; especially since they did not regard Him as the visible Light known to us, but as the Primord ial Ether-Ocean from which light flows. Before the creation, did the Deity dwell alone in the Darkne ss, or in the Light? Did the Light co-exist with Him, or was it created, after an eternit y of darkness ? and if it co- existed, was it an effluence from Him, filling all space as He also filled it, He and the Light at the same time filling the same place and every place? MILTON say s, expressing the Hebraic doctrine: \"Hail, Holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born, Or of th’ Eternal, co-eternal beam! May I express thee unblamed, since God is Ligh t .

To conceive of God as an actualit y, and not as a mere non-substance or name, which involved non- existence , the Kabala, like the Egyptians, imagin ed Him to be \"a most occult Light,\" AUR; not our ma terial and visible Light, but the Substance out of which Light flows, the fire , as relative to its heat and flame. Of this Light or Ether, the Sun was to the Tsabeans the onl y manifest ation or out-shining, and as such it was worshipped, and not as the type of dom inion and power. God was the Ph ō s No ē t o n , the Light cognizabl e only by the Intellect, the Light-Principle, the Light- Ether, from which souls emanat e, and to which they return. Light, Fire, and Flame, with the Phœnicians, were the sons of Krono s. They are the Trinity in the Chaldæan Oracles, the AOR of the Deity, manifested in flame , that issues out of the invisible Fire . In the first three Persian Amshaspands, Lords of LIG HT, FIRE, and SPLEND OR, we recognize the AOR, ZO HAR, and ZAY O, Light , Splendor , and Brightness , of the Kabalah. The first of these is termed AOR MU PALA, Wond erful or Hidden Light , unrevealed, undispla yed – which is KETHER, the first Emana tion or Sephirah , the Will of Deit y: the second is NESTAR, Concealed – which is HAKEM AH, the second Sephirah , or the Intellectual Potence of the Deit y: and the third is META NOTSATS, coru scating – which is BINA H, the third Sephirah , or the intellec tual producing capacit y. In other words, they are THE VERY S UBSTANCE of light, in the Deity: Fire , which is that light, limited and furnished with attributes, so that it can be revealed, but yet remains unrevealed, and its splendor or out- shining, or the light that goes out from the fire. Masonry is a search after Light. That search leads us directl y back, as you see, to the Kabalah. In that ancient and little understood medley of absurdit y and philosophy , the Initiate will find the source of man y doctrines; and ma y in time come to understand the Hermetic philosophers, the Alchemists, all the Anti-papal Thinkers of the Middle Ages, and Emanue l Swedenborg. The Hansavati Rich, a celebra ted Sanscrit Stanza, says: \"He is Hansa (the Sun), d welling in light; Vasu, the atmosphere dwelling in the firmament; the invoker of the gods (Agni), dwelling on the altar ( i.e. , the altar fire); the guest (of the worshipper), dwelling in the Page 531 of 621"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike house (the domestic fire); the dweller amongst men (as consciousness); the dweller in the most excellent orb, (the Sun); the dweller in truth; the dweller in the sky (the air); born in the waters, in the rays of light, in the verity (of manifest ation), in the Eastern mountains; the Truth (itself).\" \"In the beginning,\" says a Sanscrit hymn, \"arose the Source of golden light. He was the only born L ord of all that is . He established the earth and the sky. Who is the God to Whom we shall offer our sacrifice?\" \"He who gives life, He who gives strength; Whose blessing all the bright gods desire; Whose shadow is immo rtality; Whose shadow is death ; Who is the God, etc?\" \"He through Whom the sky is bright and the earth for us; He through Whom the Heaven was established, nay, the highest Heaven; He who measured out the light in the air; Who is the God, etc?\" \"He to Whom the Heaven and earth, standing firm by His will, look up tre mbling inwardly ; He over Who m the rising sun s hines forth; Who is the God, etc?\" \"Wherever the mighty water-clouds went, where the y placed the seed and lit the fire, thence arose He Who is the onl y life of the bright gods; Who is the God, etc?\" The WORD of God, said the Indian philosophy , is the universal 'and invisible Light, cognizable by the senses, that emits its blaze in the Sun, Moon, Planets, and other Stars. Philo calls it the \"Universal Light,\" which loses a portion of its purity and splendor in descending from the intellectual to the sensible world, man ifesting itself outwardly from the Deity; and the Kabalah represents that only so much of the Infinite Light flowed into the circular void prepared for creation within the Infinite Light and Wisdom, as could pass by a canal like a line or thread. The Sephiroth, emanating from the Deit y, were the rays of His splendor. The Chaldæan Oracles said: \"The intell ect of the Generator, stirred to action, out-spoke, forming within itself, by intellect ion, universals of every possible form and fashion, which issued out, flowing forth from the One Source... For Deit y, impersonat ed as Dominion, before fabricating the man ifold Universe, posited an intell ected and unchangeable universal, the impression of the form whereof goes forth through the Universe; and that Universe, form ed and fashioned accordingl y, becomes visibly beautified in infinitel y varying types and forms, the Source and fountain whereof is one... Intellectu al conceptions and forms from the Generative source, succeeding each other, considered in relation to ever-progres sing Time, and inti mately partaking of THE PRIM AL ETHER or FIRE; but yet all these Universals and Primal Types and Ideas flowed forth from, and are part of, the first Source of the Generative Power, perfect in itself.\" The Chaldæans ter med the Supreme Deity ARAOR, Father of Light. From Him was supposed to flow the light above the world, which illu minates the heavenl y regions. This Light or Fire was considered as the S ymbol of the Divine Essence, extending itself to inferior spiritual natures. Hence the Chaldæan oracles say: \"The Father took from Himself, and did not confine His proper fire within His intellec tual potenc y:\" . . \"All things are begotten from one Fire.\" Page 532 of 621"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Tsabeans held that all inferior spiritual beings were em anations from the Supreme Deity; and therefore Proclus says: \"The progression of the gods is one and continuous, proceeding downward from the intellig ible and latent unities, and terminating in the last partition of the Divine cause.\" It is impossible to speak clearl y of the Divinit y. Whoever attempts to express His attributes by the help of abstractions, confines himself to negatives, and at once loses sight of his ideas, in wandering through a wilderness of words. To heap Superlativ es on Superlativ es, and call Him best , wisest , greatest , is but to exaggerat e qualities which- are found in man. That there exists one only God, and that He is a Perfect and Beneficent Being, Reason legitimately teaches us; but of the Divine Nature , of the Substance of the Deity, of the manner of His Existence, or of the mode of creation of His Universe, the human mind is inadequate to form any just conception. We can affix no clear ideas to Omnipot ence, Omnisci ence, Infinity or Eternit y; and we have no more right to attribute intelligen ce to Him, than an y other mental quality of ourselves, extended indefinite ly; or than we have to attribute our senses to Him, and our bodily organs, as the Hebrew writings do. We satisfy ourselves with negativing in the Deity everything that constitutes existence, so far as we are capable of conceiving of existence. Thus He becomes to us logicall y nothing, Non-Ens . The Ancients saw no difference between that and Atheism, and sought to conceive of Him as something real. It is a necessit y of Human Nature. The theologic al idea, or rather non-idea, of the Deit y, is not shared or apprecia ted by the unlearned. To them, God will always be The Father Who is in Heaven, a Monarch on His Throne, a Being with human feelings and human sympathies, angry at their misdeeds, lenient if they repent, accessible to their supplicat ions. It is the Humanity, far more than the Divinit y, of Christ, that makes the mass of Christians wor ship Him, far more than they do the Father. \"The Light of the Substance of The Infinite,\" is the Kabalistic expression. Christ was, according to Saint John, \"the Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the. world\"; and \"that Light was the life of men.\" \"The Light shone in the darknes s: and the darknes s comprehended it not.\" The ancient ideas in respect to Light were perhaps quite as correct as our own. It does not appear that they ascribed to Light any of the qualit ies of matter. But modern Science defines it to be a flood of particles of matter , flowing or shot out from the Sun and Stars, and moving through space to com e to us. On the theories of mechanism and force, what force of attraction here or repulsion at the Sun or at the most distant Star could draw or drive these impalpab le, weightless, infinitel y minute particles, appreciabl y by the Sense of Sight alone, so far through space? What has beco me of the immense aggregate of particl es that have reached the earth since the creation? Have the y increased its bulk? Why cannot chemistry detect and anal yze them? If matt er, why can the y travel only in right lines? No characterist ic of matter belongs to Light, or Heat, or flam e, or to Galvanism, Electricity, and Magnetis m. The electric spark is light, and so is that produced by the flint, when it cuts off particles of steel. Iron, me lted or heated, radiates light; and insects, infusoria, and deca yed wood emi t it. Heat is produced by friction and by pressure; to explain which, Science tells us of latent Caloric, thus representing it to us as existing without its only known distinctiv e quality.

What quality of matter enables it to make the circuit of the earth in a score of seconds ? Profoundl y ignorant of the nature of these migh ty agents of Divine Power, we conceal our ignorance by words that have no mean ing; and we might well be asked why Light may not be an effluence from the Deity, as has been agreed by all the religions of all the Ages of the World. All truly dogma tic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to it: everything scientifi c and grand in the religious dreams of all the illu minati, Jacob Bœhme, Swedenborg, Saint- Martin, and others, is borrowed from the Kabalah; all the Masonic associations owe to it their Secrets and their Symbols. The Kabalah alone consecrates the alliance of the Universal Reason and the Divine Word; it establishes, by the counterpoises of two forces apparentl y opposite, the eternal balance of being; it alone reconciles Reason with Faith, Power with Libert y, Science with My stery; it has the keys of the Present, the Past, and the Future. The Bible, with all the allegories it contains, expresses, in an incomp lete and veiled manner only, the religious science of the Hebrews. The doctrine of Moses and the Prophets, identic al at bottom with that of the ancient Egyptians, also had its outward meaning and its veils. The Hebrew books were written only to recall to memory the traditions; and the y were written in Symbols unintell igible to the Profane. The Pentateuch and the prophetic poems were merely elementary books of doctrine, morals, or liturg y; and the hue secret and traditiona l philosoph y was only written afterward, under veils still less transparent. Thus was a second Bible born, unknown to, or rather uncompreh ended by, the Christians; a collec tion, they say, of monstrous absurdities; a monu ment, the adept says, wherein is every thing that the genius of philosophy and that of religion have ever form ed or imagined of the subli me; a treasure surrounded by thorns; a dia mond concealed in a rough dark stone. One is filled with admira tion, on penetrating into the Sanctuary of the Kabalah, at seeing a doctrine so logical, so simpl e, and at the same time so absolute. The necessar y union of ideas and signs, the consecration of the most fundamenta l realities by the primitive characters; the Trinit y of Words, Letters, and Numbers; a philosophy simple as the alphabet, profound and infinite as the Word; theorems more complete and lum inous than those of Pythagoras; a theolog y summed up by counting on one' s fingers; an Infinite which can be held in the hollow of an infant's hand; ten ciphers, and twent y-two letters, a triangle, a square, and a circle, – these are all the elements of the Kabalah. These are the elementary principles of the written Word, reflection of that spoken Word that created the world! This is the doctrine of the Kabalah, with which y ou will no doubt seek to make yourself acquainted, as to the Creation. The Absolute Deity, with the Kabalists, has no name. The ter ms applied to Him are אור פשוט , AOR PA SOT, the Most Simple [or Pure] Light, \"called, אין סוף , AYEN S OPH, or INFINITE, before any Emana tion.

He was without Idea or Figu re, and it is forbidden to form any Idea or Figure of Him, neither by the letter He ( ה ), nor by the letter Y d ( ō י ), though these are contained in the Holy Name; nor by any other letter or point in the world. But after He created this Idea [this lim ited and existing- in-intell ection Nature, which the ten Numerat ions, SEPHIROTH or Rays are], of the Medium, the First Man A DAM KADMON, He descended therein, that, by means of this Idea, He migh t be called by the name TETRAGRAM MATON; that created things might have cognition of Him, in His own likeness. When the Infinite God willed to emit what were to flow forth, He contracted Himself in the centre of His light, in such mann er that that most intense light should recede to a certain circu mference, and on all sides upon itself. And this is the first contraction, and termed צמצם Tsemsu m . אדם קדמון , ADAM KADMON, the Primal or First Man, is the first Aziluthic emanant from the Infinite Light, immitted into the evacuated Space, and from which, afterward, all the other degrees and systems had their beginnings. It is. called the Adam prior to all the first. In it are imparted ten spherical numerat ions; and thereaft er issued forth the rectiline ar figure of a man in his sephirothic decade, as it were the diameter of the said circles; as it were the axis of these spheres, reaching from their highest point to their lowest; and from it depend all the systems. But now, as the Infinite Light would be too excellent and great to be borne and endured, except through the med ium of this Adam Kadmon, its most Secret Nature preventing this, its illuminating light had again to emanate in streams out of itself, by certain apertures, as it were, like windows, and which are termed the ears, eyes, nostrils, and mou th. The light proceeding from this Adam Kadmon is indeed but one; but in proportion to its remoteness from the place of out-flowing, and to the grades of its descent, it is more dense. From the word אצל , ATSIL, to em anate or flow forth, com es the word אצילות , ATSILOTH or Aziluth, Emanation, or the System of Eman ants. When the prim al space was evacuat ed, the surrounding Light of the Infinite, and the Light immitted into the void, did not touch each other; but the Light of the Infinite flowed into that void through a line or certain slender canal; and that Light is the Emanative and em itting Principle, or the out-flow and origin of Eman ation: but the Light within the void is the em anant subordinate; and the two cohere only by means of the aforesaid line. Aziluth means specifically and principall y the first system of the four Olamoth [ עלמות ], worlds or sy stems; which is thence called the Aziluthic World. The ten Sephiroth of the general Aziluthic system are ten Nekudoth or Points. אינזף AINSOPH, AENS OPH, or A YENSO PH, is the title of the Cause of Causes, its meaning being \" endless ,\" because there is no lim it to Its loftiness, and nothing can comprehend it.

What then did the Lord of the Will, that most perfectl y free Agent, do? By His own estimation, He measured off within His own Sub stance the width and length of a circular space to be mad e vacant, and wherein might be posited the worlds aforesaid; and of that Light which was included within the circle so measured, He compr essed and folded over a certain portion... and that Light He lifted higher up, and so a place was left unoccupied by the Primal Light. But yet was not this space left altogether empty of that Light; for the vestiges of the Prim al Light still remained in the place where Itself had been; and they did not recede therefro m. Before the Emanations out-flowed, and created things were created, the Suprem e Light was infinitel y extended, and filled the whole Where : nothing was , except that extended light, called AOR H’ A INSOPH, the Light of the non-finite. When it came into the mind of the Extended to will to make worlds, and b y forth-flowing to utter Emana tions, and to emit as Light the perfection of His active powers, and of His aspects and attributes, which was the impelling cause of the creation of worlds; then that Light, in some measure compressed, receded in ever y direction from a particular central point, and on all sides of it drew back, and so a certain vacuum was left, called void space, its circumf erence everywhere equidistant from that point which was exactl y in the centre of the space... a certain void place and space left in Mid-Infinite: a certain Where was thereby constituted wherein Emanations might BE, and the Created, the Fashioned and the Fabricated. This world of the garmenting , – this circular vacant space, with the vestiges of the withdrawn light of the Infinite yet remaining, is the inmost garment, nearest to His substance; and to it belongs the name AOR PENAI-AL, Light of the Countenance of God . An interspace surrounds this great circle, established between the light of the very substance, surrounding the circle on its outside, and the substance contained within the circle. This is called SPLENDOR EXCELSU S, in contradistinct ion to Simple Splendor. This light \"of the vestige of the garment,\" is said to be, relativel y to that of the vestige of the substance, like a point in the centre of a circle. This light, a point in the centre of the Great Light, is called Auir, Ether, or Space.

The Sephiroth, someti mes called the Persons of the Deit y, are His rays , by which He is enabled most perfectl y to man ifest Himself. The Introduction to the Book SO NAR say s: The first compr ession was effected, in order that the Primal Light might be upraised, and a space become vacant. The second compression occurred when the vestiges of the re moved Light remaining were compressed into points; and that compression was effected by means of the emotion of joy; the Deit y rejoicing, it had alread y been said, on account of His Holy People, thereafter to come into being; and that joy being vehe ment, and a com motion and exhilara tion in the Deit y being caused by it, so that He flowed forth in His delight; and of this commotion an abstract power of judgment being generated, which is a collect ion of the letters generated by the points of the vestiges of Light left within the circle. For He writes the finite expressions, or limited manifestations of Himself upon the Book, in single letters . Like as when water or fire, it had been said, is blown upon by the wind, it is wont to be greatly moved, and with flashes like lightning to smite the eyes, and glea m and coruscate hither and thither, even so The Infinite was moved within Himself, and shone and coruscated in that circle, from the centre outward and again to the centre: and that commotion we term exhilaration ; and from that exhilaration, variously divided within Himself, was generated the potenc y of deter mining the fashioning of the letters. Of that exhilaration, it had also been said, wa s generated the deter mination of forms , by which determ ination the Infinite determ ined them within Himself, as if by saying: \"Let this Sphere be the appointed place, wherein let all worlds be created!\" He, by radiating and coruscating, effected the points, so that their sparkling should smi te the eyes like lightning. Then He combined diversel y the single points, until letters were fashioned thereof, in the similitude and image of those wherewith THE BLESSED had set forth the decrees of His Wisdom. It is not pos sible to attain to an understanding of the creation of man, except by the mystery of letters; and in these worlds of The Infinite is nothing, except the letters of the Alphabet and their combinations. All the worlds are Letters and Names; but He Who is the Author of all, has no name. This world of the covering [or garment – vestimenti ], [that is, the circular vacant space, with the vestiges of the remov ed Light of The Infinite still remaining after the first contract ion and compr ession], is the inmost covering, nearest to His substance; and to this covering belongs the general name AUR PENIAL, Light of the Countenance of God : by which we are to understand the Light of The Substance. And after this covering was effected, He contracted it, so as to lift up the lower moie ty;... and this is the third contraction; and in this manner He made vacant a space for the worlds, which had not the capacit y to use the great Light of the covering, the end whereof was lucid and excell ent as its beginning. And so [by drawing up the lower half and half the Page 537 of 621"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike letters], are made the Male and Female , that is, the anterior and posterior adhering mutually to one another. The vacant space effected by this retraction is called AUIR K ADMON, the PRIM AL SPACE: for it was the first of all Spaces; nor wa s it allowable to call it covering , which is AUR PE NI-BAL, the Light of the Countenance of God. The vestiges of the Light of the Garment still remained there. And this world of the garment has a name that includes all things , which is the name IHUH. Before the world of the vacant space was created, HE was, and His Name, and they alone; that is, AIN SOPH and His garmenting. The EMECH H AMMELECH sa ys again: The lower half of the garm ent [by the third retraction], was left empty of the light of the garment. But the vestiges of that light remain ed in the place so vacated... and this garment is called SHEKIN AH, God in-dwelling; that is, the place where יה Y d He, of the anterior ō [or male], and וה Vav He, of the posterior [or femal e], combinations of letters dwelt. This vacant space was square, and is called the Primal Space ; and in Kabalah it is called Auira Kad mah , or Rasimu Ailah , The Primal Space, or The Sublime Vestige. It is the vestige of the Light of the Garmen t, with which is interm ingled somewhat of the vestige of the Very Substance. It is called Primal Ether , but not void Space... The Light of the Vestige still remains in the place it occupied, and adheres there, like somewhat spiritual, of extreme tenuity. In this Ether are two Lights; that is, the Light of the SUB STANCE, which was taken away, and that of the Garment. There is a vast difference between the two; for that of the Vestige of the Garment is, relativel y to that of the Vestige of the Substance, like a point in the centre of a circle . And as the onl y appropriate name for the Light of the Vestige of Ainsoph is A UR, Light , therefore the Light of the Vestige of the Garment could not be called by that name; and so we ter m it a point , that is, Y d [’ or ō י ], which is that point in the centre of Light... and this Light, a point in the centre of the Great Light, is called Auir , Ether, or Space.

The Introduction to the Book Sohar continues, in the Section of the Letter Y d, et ō c: Worlds could not be framed in this Prima l Ether, on account of its extreme tenuity and the excess of Light; and also because in it remained the vital Spirit of the Vestige of the Light Ainsoph, and that of the Vestige of the Light of the Garmen t; whereby such manifest ation was prevented.

And by its return, manifest ation is effected in the space below, and a Vestige of the Sublime Brilliance yet remains there, existing as a Spherical Shape, and term ed in the Sohar simpl y Tehiru , that is, Splendor; and it is styled The First Matter... it being, as it were, vapor, and, as it were, smoke. And as smoke is formless, not compreh ended under any fixed definite form, so this Sphere is a formless somewha t, since it seems to be somewhat that is spherical, and yet is not limited. The letter Y d, while adhering to the Shekinah, had adhering to himself the Light of the ō Shekinah, though his light was not so great as that of the Shekinah. But when he descended, he left that light of his own below, and the Splendor consisted of it. After which there was left in Y d only a vestige of that light, inasmuch as he could not re-ascend ō to the Shekinah and adhere to it. Wherefore The Holy and Blessed directed the letter He [ ה , the female letter], to com municate to Y d of her Light; and sent him ō forth, to descend and share with that light in the Splendor aforesaid... and when he re-descended into the Sphere of Splendor, he diffused abroad in it the Light communicated to him by the letter He. And when he again ascended he left behind hi m the productive light of the letter He, and thereof was constituted another Sphere, within the Sphere of Splendor; which lesser Sphere is termed in the Sohar KETHER AILAH, COR ONA S UMMA, The Supreme Crown , and also ATIKA DI ATI KIM, Antiquus Antiquum , The Ancient of Ancients , and even AILIT H’ AILIT, Causa Causa rum , the Cause of Cau ses .

And AI NSOPH had full consciousness and appreciat ion, prior to their actual existence, of all the Grades and Impersona tions contained unmanifested within Himself, with regard to the essence of each, and its dom ination then in potency ... When He came to the Sephirah of the Impersonat ion Malakoth, which He then contained hidden within Himself, He concluded within Himself that therein worlds should be framed; since the scale of the first nine Sephiroths was so constituted, that it was neither fit nor necessar y for worlds to be framed from them ; for all the attributes of these nine Superior Sephiroth could be assigned to Himself, even if He should never operate outwardl y; but Malakoth, which is Empire or Dominion, could not be attributed to Him, unless He ruled over other Existences; whence from the point Malakoth He produced all the worlds into actuali ty. These circles are ten in number. Originated by points, the y expanded in circular shape. Ten Circles, under the mystery of the ten Sephiroth, and between the m ten Spaces; whence it appears that the sphere of Splendor is in the centre of the space Malakoth of the First Occult Adam. The First Adam, in the ten circles above the Splendor , is called the First occult Adam; and in each of these spaces are form ed many thousand worlds. The first Adam is involved in the Primal Ether, and is the analogue of the world Binah.

To prevent it from flowing into and re-filling the quasi-vacant space, occupied by an infinitely less Splendor, a partition between the greater and lesser Splendor was necessar y; and this partition, the boundar y of the sphere of Splendor, and a like one bounding the sphere Kether, were called Vessels or Receptacl es , containing , including, and enclosing within themse lves the light of the sphere. Imag ine a sea of pellucid water, and in the centre of it a spherical mass of denser and darker water. The outer surface of this sphere, or its limits every way, is the vessel containing it. The Kabalah regards the vessels \"as by their nature somewhat opaque, and not so splendid as the light they enclose.\" The contained Light is the Soul of the vessels, and is active in them, like the Human Soul in the human body. The Light of the Emanative Principle [Ainsoph] inheres in the vessels, as their Life , internal Light , and Soul ... Kether em anated, with its Very Substance, at the same time as Substance and Vessel, in like manner as the fla me is annexed to the live coal, and as the Soul pervades, and is within, the body. All the Numerat ions were potential ly contained in it. And this potentia lity is thus explained: When a woman conceives, a Soul is im mediately sent into the embryo which is to becom e the infant, in which Soul are then, potentia lly, all the members and veins of the body, which afterward, from that potenc y of the Soul, become in the human body of the child to be born. Then the wisdom of God com manded that these Numerat ions potentiall y in Kether, should be produced from potentia lity into actualit y, in order that worlds might consist; and HE directed Y d again to descend, and to enter into and shine within Kether, and then to re- ō ascend: which was so done. From which illumination and re-ascension, all the other numerations, potentially in Kether, were manifested and disclosed; but they continue d still compacted together, remaining within Kether in a circle. When God willed to produce the other emanations or numerations from Kether, it is added, HE sent Y d down again, to the upper part of Kether, one-half of him to remain without ō and one-half to penetrate within the sphere of Kether. Then HE sent the letter Vav into the Splendor, to pour out its light on Y d: and thus, – ō Y d received light from Vav, and thereby so directed his countenance that it should ō illuminate and confer exceeding great energ y on Hakem ah, which y et remained in Kether; so giving it the faculty to proceed forth therefro m; and that it might collect and contain within itself, and there reveal, all the other eight numera tions, until that time in Kether. The sphere of Kether opened, and thereout issued Hakem ah, to remain below Kether, containing in itself all the other numera tions. By a similar process, Binah, illuminated within Hakemah by a second Y d, \"issued forth ō out of Hakemah, having within itself the Seven lower Numerations.\" And since the vessel of Binah was excell ent, and coruscated with ray s of the color of sapphire, and was s o nearly of the same color as the vessel of Hakem ah that there was scarcely any difference between them, hence it would not quietl y remain below Hakemah, but rose, and placed itself on his left side.

For Binah is female ... Binah, therefore, by means of this energy that flowed into it from the left side of Hakemah, by virtue of the second Y d, came to possess such virtue and potency, as to project beyond ō itself the Seven remaining vessels contained within itself, and so em itted them all, continuousl y, one after the other... all connected and linked one with the other, like the links of a chain. Three points first emanated, one under the other; Kether, Hakemah, and Binah; and, so far, there was no copulation. But afterward the positions of Hakemah and Binah changed, so that they were side b y side, Kether remaining above them; and then conjunction of the Male and Femal e, ABA and I MMA, Father and Mother , as points. He, from Whom all emanated, created Adam Kadmon, consisting of all the worlds, so that in him should be somewha t from those above, and somewhat from those below. Hence in Him was NEPHESC H [PSYC HE, anima infima , the lowest spiritual part of man, Soul], from the world ASI AH, which is one letter He of the Tetragra mmaton; RUAC H [ SPIRITUS, anima media , the next higher spiritual part, or Spirit ], from the world YEZIRAH, which is the Vav of the Tetragram maton; NESCHAMAH [the highest spiritual part, mens or anima superior ], from the world BRIAH, which is the other letter He ; and NESCHAMAH LENESCHAMAH, from the world ATSILUTH, which is the Y D of the Ō Tetragrammaton. And these letters [the Sephiroth] were changed from the spherical form into the form of a person, the symbol of which person is the BALA NCE, it being Male and Female ... Hakemah on one side, Binah on the other, and Kether over the m: and so Gedulah on one side, Geburah on the other, and Tephareth under them. The Book Omschim says: Some hold that the ten Sephiroth succeeded one another in ten degrees, one above the other, in regular gradation, one connected with the other in a direct line, from the highest to the lowest. Others hold that they issued forth in three lines, parallel with each other, one on the right hand, one on the left, and one in the middle ; so that, beginning with the highest and going down to the lowest, Hakemah, Khased [or Gedulah], and Netsach are one over the other, in a perpendicular line, on the right hand; Binah, Geburah, and H d on the left; and Kether, Tephareth, Yesod, and Malakoth ō in the middle: and man y hold that all the ten subsist in circles, one within the other, and all homocentric. It is also to be noted, that the Sephirothic tables contain still another numerat ion, sometimes called also a Sephirah, which is called Daath, cognition. It is in the middle, below Hakemah and Binah, and is the result of the conjunction of these two. To Adam Kadmon, the Idea of the Universe, the Kabalah assigns a human form. In this, Kether is the craniu m, Hakemah and Bi nah the two lobes of the brain, Gedulah and Page 543 of 621"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Geburah the two arms, Tephareth the trunk, Netsach and H d the thighs, Yesod the male ō organ, and Malkuth the female organ, of generation. Y d is Hakemah, and He Dinah; Vav is Tephareth, and the last He, Malkuth. ō The whole, sa y the Books Mysterii or of Occultation , is thus summ ed up: The intention of God The Blessed was to form Impersonat ions, in order to diminish the Light. Wherefore HE constituted, in Macroprosopos, A dam Kadmon, or Arik Anpin, three Heads. The first is called, \"The Head whereof is no cognition\"; the second, \"The Head of that which is non- existent\"; and the third, \"The Very Head of Macroprosopo s\"; and these three are Corona , Sapientia , and Informatio , Kether, Hakem ah, and Binah, existent in the Corona of the World of Eman ation, or in Macroprosopos; and these three are called in the Sohar ATIKA KADISCH A, Senex Sanctissimus , The Most Holy Ancient. But the Seven inferior Royalties of the first Adam are called \"The Ancient of Day s\"; and this Ancient of Days is the internal part, or Soul, of Macroprosopos. The human mind has never struggled harder to understand and explain to itself the process of creation, and of Divine manifesta tion, and at the same time to conceal its thoughts from all but the initiated , than in the Kabalah. Hence, mu ch of it seems at first like jargon. Macroprosopos or A dam Kadmon is, we have said, the idea or intell ectual aggregate of the whole Universe, included and contained unevolved in the man ifested Deity, Himself yet contained unmanifest ed in the Absolute. The Head, Kether, \"whereof is no cognition,\" is the Will of the Deit y, or the Deity as Will. Hakemah, the head \"of that which is non- existent,\" is the Generative Power of begetting or producing Thought; yet in the Deity, not in action, and therefore non-existent. Binah, \"the ver y or actual head\" of Macropro sopos, is the productive intellectual capacit y, which, impregn ated by Hakemah, is to produce the Thought. This Thought is Daath; or rather, the result is Intellect ion, Thinking; the Unity , of which Thoughts are the manifo ld outflowings. This may be illustra ted by a comparison. Pain, in the human being, is a feeling or sensation. It must be produced . To produce it, there must be, not onl y the capacity to produce it, in the nerves, but also the power of generating it by means of that capacity. This generative Power, the Passive Capacit y which produces, and the pain produced, are like Hakemah, Dinah, and Daath. The four Worlds or Universals, Aziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Asiah, of Eman ation, Creation, Formation, and Fabrication, are another enigma of the Kabalah. The first three are wholly within the Deity. The first is the Universe, as it exists potential ly in the Deity, determined and im agined, but as y et wholly formless and undeveloped, except so far as it is contained in His Emana tions. The second is the Universe in idea, distinct within the Deity, but not invested with forms; a simpl e unity. The third is the same Universe in potence in the Deit y, unmanif ested, but invested with forms, – the idea developed into manifoldness and individual ity, and succession of species and individuals; and the fourth is the potential ity become the Actualit y, the Universe fabricated, and existing as it exists for us. The Sephiroth, says the Porta Cælorum , by the virtue of their Infinite Emanator, who uses them as a workman uses his tools, and who operates with and through the m, are the cause Page 544 of 621"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike of existence of every thing created, formed, and fashioned, e mploying in their production certain media . But these same Sephiroth , Persons and Lights , are not creatures per se , but ideas , and Rays of THE INFI NITE, which, b y different gradations, so descended from the Supreme Source as still not to be severed from It; but It, through the m, is extended to the production and govern ment of all Entities, and is the Single and Perfect Universal Cause of All, though becom ing determinate for this or the other operation, through this or that Sephiroth or MODE. God produced all things by His Intelle ct and Will and free Determin ation. He willed to produce them by the med iation of His Sephiroth, and Persons... . b y which He is enabled most perfectl y to man ifest Himself; and that the more perfectl y, by producing the causes themselves, and the Causes of Causes, and not m erely the viler effects. God produced, in the first Originate, all the rem aining causates. For, as He Himself is most simply One, and from One Simp le Being One only can im mediately proceed, hence it results that from the First Suprem e Infinite Unity flowed forth at the same time All and One. One, that is, in so far as flowing from the Most Simpl e Unity, and being like unto It; but also All, in so far as, departing from that perfect Singleness which can be measured by no other Singleness, it became, to a certain extent, manifold, though still Absolute and Perfect. Emanation, says the same, is the Resulting displayed from the Unresulting, the Finite from the Infinite, the Manifold and Composite from the Perfect Single and Simpl e, Potential ity from that which is Infinite Power and Act, the mobile from that which is perennial ly permanent; and therefore in a more imperfec t and diminished mode than His Infinite Perfection is. As the First Cause is all things, in an unresulting and Infinite mode, so the Entities that flow from Him are the First Causes, in a resulting and finite mode. THE NECES SARY ENTITY, sub sisting of Itself, as It cannot be dissevered into the manifold, yet becom es, as it were, multiplied in the Causates, in respect of their Nature, or of the Subsistences, Vessels, and openings assigned to them; whereby the Single and Infinite Essence, being inclosed or compr ehended in these limits, bounds, or externalnesses, takes on Itself Definiteness of dimension, and beco mes Itself manifold, by the manifo ldness of these envelopes. As man [the unit of Human ity] is a microcos m, so Adam Kadmon is a ma crocosm , containing all the Causates of the First Cause... . as the Material Man is the end and completion of all creation, so in the Divine Man is the beginning thereof. As the inferior Adam receives all things from all, so the superior Adam supplies all things to all. As the former is the principle of reflected light, so the latter is of Direct Light. The former is the terminus of the Light, descending; the latter its terminus, ascending. As the Inferior m an ascends from the lowest matter even to the First Cause, so the Superior Adam descends from the Simpl e and Infinite Act, even to the lowest and most attenuat ed Potence. The Ternar y is the bringing back of dualit y to unity. The Ternar y is the Principle of Number, because, bringing back the binar y to unity, it restores to it the same quantit y whereby it had departed from unity. It is the first odd Page 545 of 621"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike number, containing in itself the first even number and the unit, which are the Father and Mother of all Numbers; and it has in itself the beginning, middle, and end. Now, A dam Kadmon emanated from the Absolute Unity, and so is himse lf a unit; but he also descends and flows do wnward into his own Nature, and so is dualit y. Again, he returns to the Unit y, which he hath in himse lf, and to The Highest, and so is the Ternar y and Quaternar y.

They are the mirrors of His Truth, and the analogues of His Supremest Essence, the Ideas of His Wisdom, and the representations of His will; the receptacles of His Potency, and the instruments with which He operates; the Treasury of His Felicit y, the dispensers of His Benignit y, the Judges of His Kingdom, and reveal His Law; and finall y, the Denomina tions, Attributes, and Names of Him Who is above all and the Cause of all... . the ten categori es, wherein all things are contained; the universal genera, which in themselves include all things, and utter them outwardly ... the Second Causes, whereby the First Cause effects, preserves, and governs all things; the rays of the Divinit y, whereby all things are illu mined and man ifested; the Forms and Ideas and Species, out whereof all things issue forth; the Souls and Potencies, whereby essence, life, and move ment are given to all things; the Standard of ti mes, whereby all things are me asured; the incorporeal Spaces which, in themse lves, hold and inclose the Universe; the Supernal Monads to which all manifolds are referred, and through them to The One and Simple ; and finally the Formal Perfections, flowing forth from and still connected with the One Em inent Limitless Perfection, are the Causes of all dependent Perfections, and so illu minate the elementary Intelligences, not adjoined to matter, and the intel lectual Souls, and the Celestial, Elemental and Elem ent-produced bodies.

HE is All that is, the Most Hol y Eldest of All, the Occult by all possible occultations. When HE takes shape, HE produces nine Lights, which shine forth from Him, from His outform ing. And those Lights out-shine from Him and em it flames, and go forth and spread out on every side; as from one elevat ed Lamp the Rays are poured forth in every direction, and these Rays thus diverging, are found to be, when one approaching has cognizance of them, but a single Lamp.

This Wisdom is the principle of all things, and in it beginning and end are found. The Book of the Abstruse, say s the Siphra de Zeniutha , is that which describes the equilibriu m of the Balance.

For, as in the Balance are two scales, one on either side and the beam and needle between them, so too in this world of restoration, the Numerations are arranged as distinct persons. For H akemah is on the right hand, on the side of Gedulah, and Binah on the left, on the side of Geburah; and Kether is the beam of the Balance above them in the midd le.

Wisdom and the Mother of Intelle ction go forth at once and dwell together; for when the Intellec tual Power eman ates, the productive Source of intell ection is included in Him. Before Adam Kadmon was fashioned into Male and Female, and the state of equilibrium introduced, the Father and Mother did not look each other in the face; for the Father denotes most perfect Love, and the Mother most perfect Rigor; and she averted her face.

By the ō upper apex is denoted the Supreme Kether; by Vav in the middle, Hakemah; and by the lower apex, Binah. The IDRA SUTA say s: The Universe was out-formed in the form of Male and Female. Wisdom, pregnant with all that is, when it flowed and shone forth, shone altogeth er under the form of male and female. Hakemah is the Father, and Binah is the Mother; and so the two are in equilibriu m as male and female, and for this reason, all things whatsoever are constituted in the form of male and female; and if it were not so they would not exist . This Principle, Hakemah, is the Generator of all things; and He and Binah conjoin, and she shines within Him. When they thus conjoin, she conceives, and the out-flow is Truth. Y d impregnates the letter He and begets a son; and she, thus pregnant, brings forth. The ō Principle called Father [the Male or Generative Principle] is comprehended in Y d, which ō its elf flows down ward from the energy of the Absolute Holy One. Y d is the beginning and the end of all things that are. The stream that flows forth is the ō Universe of things, which always becomes , having no cessation. And this becoming world is created by Y d: for Y d includes two letters. All things are included in Y d; wherefore ō ō ō it is called the Father of all. All Categories whatever go forth from Hakemah ; and in it are contained all things, unmanifested; and the aggregate of all things, or the Unity in which the many are , and out of which all flow, is the Sacred Name IHUH. In the view of the Kabalists, all individuals are contained in species, and all species in genera, and all particulars in a Universal, which is an idea, abstracted from all consideration of individuals; not an aggregate of individuals; but, as it were, an Ens , Entity or Being, ideal or intelle ctual, but none the less real; prior to any individual, containing them all, and out of which they are all in succession evolved. If this discontents y ou, reflect that, supposing the theory correct, that all was originall y in the Deity, and that the Universe has proceeded forth from Him, and not been created by Him out of nothing, the idea of the Universe, existing in the Deit y before its out-flow, must have been as real as the Deity Himself. The whole Human race, or Humanity, for exa mple, then existed in the Deity, not distinguished into individuals, but as a Unit, out of which the Manifold was to flow. Everything actual must also first have been possible , before having actual existence; and this possibility or potentiali ty was to the Kabalists a real Ens. Before the evolve ment of the Universe, it had to exist potential ly , the whole of it, with all its individuals, included in a single Unity. This was the Idea or Plan of the Universe; and this had to be formed . It had to emanate from the Infinite Deity, and be of Himself, though not His Very Self.

In the vacant space effected for creation, there at last remained a faint vestige or trace of Ainsophic Light, of the Light of the Substance of the Infinite. Man is thus both human and divine: and the apparent antagonisms in his Nature are a real equilibriu m, if he wills it shall be so ; from which results the Harmon y, not only of Life and Action, but of Virtue and Perfection. To understand the Kabalistic idea of the Sephiroth, it must be borne in mind that they were assigned, not only to the world of Eman ation, Aziluth, but also to each of the other worlds, Briah, Jezirah, and Asiah. They were not only attribut es of the Unmanif ested Deity, not only Himself in limitation, but His actual manifesta tions, or His qualities made apparent as modes; and the y were also qualities of the Universal Nature – Spiritual, Mental, and Material, produced and m ade existent by the outflow of Himself. In the view of the Kabalah, God and the Universe were One, and in the One General, as the type or source, were included and involved, and from it have been evolved and issued forth, the man ifold and all particulars. Where, indeed, does individualit y begin? I s it the Hidden Source and Spring alone that is the individua l, the Unit, or is it the flowing fountain that fills the ocean, or the ocean itself, or its waves, or the drops, or the vaporous particles, that are the individuals? The Sea and the River – these are each One; but the drops of each are man y. The tree is one; but its leaves are a multitude: they drop with the frosts, and fall upon his roots; but the tree still continues to grow, and new leaves come again in the Spring. Is the Human Race not the Tree, and are not individual men the leaves? How else explain the force of will and sympathy, and the dependence of one man at every instant of his life on others, except by the oneness of the race? The links that bind all created things together are the links of a single Unit y, and the whole Universe is One, developing itself into the manifold. Obtuse com mentators have said that the Kabalah assigns s exual characterist ics to the ver y Deity. There is no warrant for such an assertion, anywhere in the Sohar or in any commentary upon it. On the contrar y, the whole doctrine of the Kabalah is based on the fundam ental proposition, that the Ver y Deity is Infinite, everywhere extended, without limitation or determ ination, and therefore without an y conformat ion whatever. In order to commence the process of creation, it was necessar y for Him, first of all, to effect a vacant space within Himself. To this end the Deit y, whose Nature is approxi mately expressed b y describing Him as Light filling all space, formless, limitless, contracts Himself on all sides from a point within Himself, and thus effects a quasi-vacant space, in which onl y a vestige of His Light remains; and into this circular or spherical space He em its His Emana tions, portions of His Light or Nature; and to some of these, sexual characterist ics are symbolically assigned.

Its SELF, which had flowed forth from Ainsoph as Will, now flows forth as the Generative Power to beget intellectual action in the Intellec tual Faculty, or Intelligence, Binah. The Act itself, the Thought, the Intellection, producing the Idea, is Daath ; and as the text of the Siphra de Zeniutha says, The Power and Facult y, the Generative and Productive, the Active and Passive, the Will and Capacit y, which unite to produce that Act of reflection or Thought or Intelle ction, are always in conjunction. As is elsewhere said in the Kabalah, both of the m are contained and essentiall y involved in the result. And the Will, as Wisdom or Intelle ctual Power, and the Capacit y or Facult y, are really the Father and Mother of all that is; for to the creation of anything , it was absolutel y necessar y that The Infinite should form for Himself and in Himself, an idea of what HE willed to produce or create: and, as there is no Time with Him, to will was to create , to plan was to will and to create ; and in the Idea, the Universe in potence, the universal succession of things was included. Thenceforward all was mere ly evolution and develop ment. Netsach and H d, the Seventh and Eighth Sephiroth, are usually called in the Kabalah, ō Victory and Glory. Netsach is the perfect Success , which, with the Deit y, to Whom the Future is present, attends , and to His creatures is to result , from the plan of Equilibriu m everywhere adopted by Him. It is the reconcili ation of Light and Darknes s, Good and Evil, Free-will and Necessit y, God's omnipot ence and Man 's libert y; and the harmon ious issue and result of all, without which the Universe would be a failure. It is the inherent Perfection of the Deity, manifest ed in His Idea of the Universe, and in all the depart ments or worlds, spiritual, mental, or mater ial, of that Universe; but it is that Perfection regarded as the successful result , which it both causes or produces and is ; the perfection of the plan being its success . It is the prevailing of Wisdom over Accident; and it, in turn, both produces and is the Glor y and Laudation of the Great Infinite Contriver, whose plan is thus Successful and Victorious. From these two, which are one, – from the excellence and perfection of the Divine Nature and Wisdom, considered as Success and Glory , as the opposites of Failure and Mortificat ion, results what the Kabalah, styling it Yesod, Foundation or Basis, character izes as the Generative member of the Symbolical human figure by which the ten Sephiroth are represented, and from this flows Malakoth, Empire, Dominion, or Rule. Yesod is the Stabili ty and Perman ence, which would, in ordinar y language, be said to result from the perfection of the Idea or Intellec tual Universal, out of which all particulars are evolved; from the success of that scheme, and the consequent Glory or Self- Page 550 of 621"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Satisfaction of the Deit y; but which Stabilit y and Permanenc e that Perfection, Success, and Glory really Is; since the Deity, infinite ly Wise, and to Whom the Past, Present, and Future were and always will be one No w, and all space one HERE, had not to await the operation and evolution of His plan, as men do the result of an experim ent, in order to see if it would succeed, and so to deter mine whether it should stand, and be stable and perman ent, or fall and be temporar y. Its Perfection was its Success ; His Glory , its permanence and stability : and the Attributes of Permanen ce and Stabilit y belong, like the others, to the Universe, material, mental, spiritual, and real, because and as they belong to the Infinite Himself. This Stabilit y and Permanence causes continuance and generates succession. It is Perpetuit y, and continuit y without solution; and by this continuous succession, whereby out of Death comes new Life, out of dissolution and resolution comes reconstruction, Necessit y and Fatalit y result as a consequence: that is to say, the absolute control and dominion (Malakoth) of The Infinite Deity over all that He produces, and over chance and accident ; and the absolute non-existence in the Universe, in Time and in Space, of any other powers or influences than those which, proceeding from Him, are and cannot not be perfectl y submissive to His will. This results , humanl y speaking; but in realit y, the Perfection of the plan, which is its success , His glory , and its stability , is also His Absolute Autocrac y, and the utter absence of Chance, Accident, or Antagonism. And, a s the Infinite Wisdom or Absolute Reason rules in the Divine Nature itself, so also it does in its Emanations, and in the worlds or sys tems of Spirit, Soul, and Matter; in each of which there is as little Chance or Accident or Unreasoning Fate, as in the Divine Nature unmanifested. This is the Kabalistic theory as to each of the four worlds; – 1st, of the Divine Nature, or Divinity itself, quantita tively limited and deter mined, but not manifested into Entities, which is the world of Emanation , 2d, of the first Entities, that is, of Spirits and Angels, which is the world of Creation ; 3d, of the first forms , souls, or ps ychical natures, which is the world of Formation or Fashioning ; and, 4th, of Matter and Bodies, which is the world of Fabrication , or, as it were, of manufactur e. In each of these the Deity is present , as , in , and through the Ten Sephiroth. First of these, in each, is Kether, the Crown, ring, or circlet, the HEAD. Next, in that Head, as the two Hemispher es of the Brain, are Hakem ah and Binah, and their result and progen y, Daath. These three are found also in the Spiritual world, and are universals in the ps ychical and mater ial world, producing the lower Sephiroth. Then follow, in perfect Equilibriu m, Law and Equit y, Justice and Mercy, the Divine Infinite Nature and the Human Finite Nature, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Benignit y and Severit y, the Male and the Female again, as Hakemah and Binah are, mutually tempering each other, and by their intimate union producing the other Sephiroth. The whole Universe, and all the succession of entities and events were present to The Infinite, before an y act of creation; and His Benignit y and Lenienc y, temper ing and qualifying the law of rigorous Justice and inflexible Retribution, enabled Him to create: because, but for it, and if He could not but have adm inistered the strict and stern law of justice, that would have compe lled Him to destro y, immediately after its inception, the Universe He purposed to create, and so would have prevented its creation. This Lenienc y, therefore, was, as it were, the ver y essence and quintessence of the Permanenc e and Stability of the plan of Creation, and part of the Very Nature of the Deity. The Kabalah, Page 551 of 621"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike therefore, designates it as Light and Whiteness , by which the Ver y Substance of Deity is symbolized. With this agree Paul's ideas as to Law and Grace; for Paul had studied the Kabalah at the feet of Gamal iel the Rabbi. With this Benignit y, the Autocrac y of the dominion and control of the Deit y is imbued and interpene trated. The form er, poured , as it were, into the latter, is an integral and essential part of it, and causes it to give birth to the succession and continuance of the Universe. For Malakoth, in the Kabalah, is female , and the matrix or womb out of which all creation is born. ☞ The Sephiroth may be arranged as below . The Kabalah is the prim itive tradition, and its entiret y rests on the single dogma of Magism, \"the visible is for us the proportional measure of the invisible.\" The Ancients, observing that equilibr ium is in physics the universal law, and that it results from the apparent opposition of two forces, concluded from the physical to the metaphysical equilibriu m, and thought that in God, that is to sa y, in the first living and active cause, two properties necessar y to each other, should be recognized ; stabilit y and movem ent, necessit y and libert y, order dictated by reason and the self-rule of Supreme Will, Justice, and Love, and consequentl y Severit y and Grace, Mercy or Benignit y. The idea of equilibrium among all the impersonat ions; of the male on one side, and the female on the other, with the Supreme Will, which is also the Absolute Reason, above each two, holding the balance, is, according to the Kabalah, the foundation of all religions and all sciences, the primary and immutable idea of things. The Sephiroth are a triple triangle and a circle, the idea of the Ternar y explained by the balance and multiplied by itself in the domain of the Ideal; then the realiza tion of this Idea in forms.

It is Unity, multiplying itself by itself to create; and therefore it is that the Sacred S ymbols make Eve issue from the very chest of Adam. Adam is the human Tetragram, which is summed up in the mysterious Y d of the Kabalah, ō image of the Kabalistic Phallus. Add to this Y d [ ō י ] the ternar y name of Eve, and yo u form the name of Jehova, the Divine Tetragra m, the transcendent Kabalistic and magical word: יהוה Thus it is that Unity, complete in the fecundit y of the Ternary , forms, with it, the Quaternar y, which is the key of all numbers, movements, and forms. The Square, turning upon itself, produces the circle equal to itself, and the circular movement of four equal angles turning around one point, is the quadrature of the circle. The Binary serves as a m easure for Unit y; and the relation of equalit y between the Above and the Below, forms with them the Ternar y. To us, Creation is Mechanis m: to the Ancients it was Generation. The world-producing egg figures in all cosmogonies; and modern science has discovered that all animal production is oviparous. From this idea of generation came the reverence everywhere paid the image of generative power, which formed the Stauros of the Gnostics, and the philosophical Cross of the Masons. Aleph is the man; Beth is the woman. One is the Principle; two is the Word. A ∴ is the Active; B ∴ is the Passive. Unity is Boaz, and the Binar y is Jachin. The two columns, Boaz and Jachin, explain in the Kabalah all the mysteries of natural, political, and religious antagonism. Woman is man's creation; and universal creation is the female of the First Principle. When the Principle of Existence made Himself Creator, He produ ced by emanation an ideal Y d; ō and to make room for it in the plenitude of the uncreated Light, He had to hollow out a pit of shadow, equal to the dimension determined by His creative desire; and attributed by Him to the ideal Y d of radiating Light. ō The nature of the Active Principle is to diffuse: of the Passive Principle, to collec t and make fruitful.

The Hermet ic philosophers also drew their doctrines from the Kabalah; and more particul arly from the Treatise Beth Alohim or Domu s Dei , known as the Pneumatica Kabalistica , of Rabbi Abraham Cohen Irira, and the Treatise De Revolutionibus Animaru m of Rabbi Jitz-chak Lorja. This philosophy was concealed by the Alchemists under their Symbols, and in the jargon of a rude Chemistr y, – a jargon incomprehensib le and absurd except to the Initiates; but the key to which is within your reach; and the philosophy , it may be, worth studying. The labors of the human intellec t are always interesting and instructive. To be alway s rich, always young, and never to die: such has been in all times the dream of the Alchem ists. To change into gold, lead, mercury, and all the other me tals; to posse ss the universal medicine and elixir of life; such is the proble m to be resolved, in order to acco mplish this desire and realize this dream. Like all the Mysteries of Magism, the Secrets of \"the Great Work\" have a threefold significat ion: they are religious, philosophical, and natural. The philosophal gold, in religion, is the Absolute and Supreme Reason: in philosoph y, it is the Truth; in visible nature, the Sun; in the subterranean and minera l world, the most perfect and pure gold. It is for this that the pursuit of the Great Work is called the Search for the Absolute; and the work itself, the work of the Sun. All the mast ers of the Science admit that it is impossibl e to attain the material results, unless there are found in the two higher Degrees all the analogies of the universal medicine and of the philosophal stone. Then, they say, the work is simple, easy, and inexpensive; otherwise, it consumes fruitlessl y the fortune and lives of the seekers. The universal medicine for the Soul is the Supreme Reason and Absolute Justice; for the mind, mathematical and practic al Truth; for the body, the Quintessence, a combina tion of light and gold. The prima materia of the Great Work, in the Superior World, is enthusiasm and activit y; in the intermediate world, intelligenc e and industr y; in the lower world, labor: and, in Science, it is the Sulphur, Mercury , and Salt, which by turns volatili zed and fixed, compose the AZOTH of the Sages. The Sulphur corresponds with the elementary form of the Fire; Mercur y with the Air and Water; and Salt with the Earth. Page 555 of 621"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Great Work is, above all things, the creation of man by himself ; that is to sa y, the fall and entire conquest which he effects of his faculti es and his future. It is, above all, the perfect emancipation of his will, which assures him the universal empire of Azoth, and the domain of magn etism, that is, comple te power over the universal Magical agent. This Magical agent, which the Ancient Herme tic philosophers disguised under the name of \" Prima Materia ,\" determ ines the forms of the mod ifiable Substance; and the Alchem ists said that by means of it they could attain the transmut ation of meta ls and the universal medicine. There are two Hermeti c operations, one spiritual, the other material, dependent the one on the other. The whole Hermet ic Science is contained in the dogma of Hermes, engraven original ly, it is said, on a tablet of emerald. Its sentences that relate to operating the Great Work are as follows: \"Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross, gentl y, with much industry. \"It ascends from earth to Heaven, and again descends to earth, and receives the force of things above and below. \"Thou shalt by this means possess the glory of the whole world, and therefore all obscurit y shall flee away from thee. \"This is the potent force of all force, for it will overco me everything subtile, and penetrate everything solid. \"So the world was created.\" All the Masters in Alche my who have written of the Great Work, have emp loyed symbolic and figurative expressions; being constrained to do so, as well to repel the profane from a work that would be dangerous for the m, as to be well understood by Adepts, in revealing to them the whole world of analogies governed by the single and sovereign dogma of Hermes. So, in their language, gold and silver are the King and Queen, or the Sun and Moon; Sulphur, the flying Eagle; Mercur y, the Man-w oman, winged, bearded, mounted on a cube, and crowned with flam es; Matter or Salt, the winged Dragon; the Metals in ebullit ion, Lions of different colors; and, finally, the entire work has for its symbols the Pelican and the Phœnix. The Hermet ic Art is, therefore, at the same time a religion, a philosoph y, and a natural science. As a religion, it is that of the Ancient Magi and the Initiat es of all ages; as a philosoph y, we may find its principles in the school of Alexandria and the theories of Pythagoras; as a science, we must inquire for its processes of Paracelsus, Nicholas Flam el, and Raymond Lulle. Page 556 of 621"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike The Science is a real one onl y for those who admit and understand the philosoph y and the religion; and its process will succeed only for the Adept who has attain ed the sovereignt y of will, and so become the King of the ele mentary world: for the grand agent of the operation of the Sun, is that force described in the Symbol of Hermes, of the table of emerald; it is the universal magical power; the spiritual, fiery, motive power; it is the Od, according to the Hebrews, and the Astral light, according to others. Therein is the secret fire, living and philosophical, of which all the Hermet ic philosophers speak with the most mysterious re-serve: the Universal Seed, the secret whereof they kept, and which they represented only under the figure of the Caduceus of Hermes. This is the grand Herme tic arcanum. What the Adepts call dead matter are bodies as found in nature; living matters are substances assimilated and magnet ized by the science and will of the operator. So that the Great Work is more than a chemical operation; it is a real creation of the human word initiat ed into the power of the Word of God. The creation of gold in the Great Work is effected by transmuta tion and multiplication. Raymond Lulle says, that to make gold, one must have gold and mercur y; and to make silver, silver and mercur y. And he adds: \"I mean by mercur y, that mineral spirit so fine and pure that it gilds even the seed of gold, and silvers that of silver.\" He mean t by this, either electricity, or Od, the astral light. The Salt and Sulphur serve in the work only to prepare the mercur y, and it is to the mercury especiall y that we must assimil ate, and, as it were, incorporate with it, the magnetic agent. Paracelsus, Lulle, and Flame l alone seem to have perfectl y known this mystery. The Great Work of Hermes is, therefore, an operation essentiall y magical, and the highest of all, for it supposes the Absolute in Science and in Will. There is light in gold, gold in light, and light in all things. The disciples of Hermes, before prom ising their adepts the elixir of long life or the powder of projection, advised the m to seek for the Philosophal Stone . The Ancients adored the Sun , under the form of a black Stone, called Elagaba lus, or Heliogabalus. The faithful are promised, in the Apocal ypse, a white Stone. This Stone , says the Masters in Alchem y, is the true Salt of the philosophers, which enters as one-third into the composi tion of Azoth. But Azoth is, as we know, the name of the grand Hermetic Agent, and the true philosophical Agent: wherefore they represent their Salt under the form of a cubical Stone. The Philosophal Stone is the foundation of the Absolute philosoph y, the Supreme and unalterab le Reason. Before thinking of the Metallic work, we must be firmly fixed on the Absolute principles of Wisdom; we must be in posses sion of this Reason, which is the touchstone of Truth. A man who is the slave of prejudices will never becom e the King of Page 557 of 621"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Nature and the Master of transmuta tions. The Philosophal Stone, therefore, is necessary above all things. Ho w shall it be found ? Hermes tells us, in his \"Table of Emerald,\" we must separate the subtile from the fixed, with great care and extrem e attention. So we ought to separate our certaint ies from our beliefs, and mak e perfectl y distinct the respective domains of science and faith; and to compreh end that we do not know the things we believe, nor believe anything that we come to know; and that thus the essence of the things of Faith are the unknown and indefinite, while it is precisel y the contrar y with the things of Science. Whence we shall conclude, that Science rests on reason and experience, and Faith has for its bases senti ment and reason. The Sun and Moon of the Alchem ists concur in perfecting and giving stabilit y to the Philosophal Stone. The y correspond to the two columns of the Te mple, Jachin and Boaz. The Sun is the hierogl yphical sign of Truth, because it is the source of Light; and the rough Stone is the s ymbol of Stabilit y. Hence the Medieval Alchemists indicated the Philosophal Stone as the first m eans of making the philosophical gold, that is to say, of transfor ming all the vital powers figured b y the six met als into Sun, that is, into Truth and Light; which is the first and indispensable operation of the Great Work, which leads to the secondary adaptation, and enables the creators of the spiritual and living gold, the posses sors of the true philosophical Salt, Mercury , and Sulphur, to discover, b y the analogies of Nature, the natural and palpable gold. To find the Philosophal Stone, is to have discovered the Absolute, as all the Masters sa y. But the Absolute is that which admits of no error s, is the Fixed from the Volatile, is the Law of the Imag ination, is the very necessit y of Being, is the immutable Law of Reason and Truth. The Absolute is that which IS. To find the Absolute in the Infinite, in the Indefinite, and in the Finite, this is the Magnum Opus, the Great Work of the Sages, which Hermes called the Work of the Sun. To find the immovable bases of true religious Faith, of Philosophical Truth, and of Metallic transmut ation, this is the secret of Hermes in its entiret y, the Philosophal Stone. This stone is one and man ifold; it is decomposed by Analysis, and re-compounded by Synthesis. In Anal ysis, it is a powder, the powder of projection of the Alchemists; before Analysis, and in Synthesis, it is a stone. The Philosophal Stone, say the Masters, must not be exposed to the atmosphere, nor to the gaze of the Profane; but it must be kept concealed and carefull y preserved in the most secret place of the laborator y, and the possessor must always carry on his person the ke y of the place where it is kept. He who pos sesses the Grand Arcanum is a genuine King, and more than a king, for he is inaccessible to all fear and all empty hopes. In all maladies of soul and bod y, a single particle from the precious stone, a single grain of the divine powder, is more than sufficient to cure him. \"Let him hear, who hath ears to hear!\" the Master said. The Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury are but the accessorial elements and passive instruments of the Great Work. All depends, as we have said, on the internal Magnet of Paracelsus. The Page 558 of 621"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike entire work consists in projection : and the projection is perfectl y accomplished by the effective and realizab le understanding of a single word. There is but a single impor tant operation in the work; this consists in Sublimation , which is nothing else, according to Geber than the elevation of dry matter, by means of fire, with adhesion to its proper vessel. He who desires to attain to the understanding of the Grand Word and the posse ssion of the Great Secret, ought carefull y to read the Hermeti c philosophers, and will undoubtedl y attain initiation, as others have done; but he must take, for the key of their allegories, the single dogma of Hermes, contained in his table of Emera ld, and follow, to class his acquisitions of knowledge and direct the operation, the order indicated in the Kabalistic alphabet of the Tarot. Raymond Lulle has said that, to make gold, we must first have gold. Nothing is m ade out of nothing; we do not absolutely create wealth; we increase and mu ltiply it. Let aspirants to science well understand, then, that neither the juggler's tricks nor m iracles are to be asked of the adept. The Herme tic science, like all the real sciences, is mathe matically demonstr able. Its results, even m aterial, are as rigorous as that of a correct equation. The Hermet ic Gold is not only a true dogma, a light without Shadow, a Truth without alloy of falsehood; it is also a ma terial gold, real, pure, the most precious that can be found in the mines of the earth. But the living gold, the living sulphur, or the true fire of the philosophers, is to be sought for in the house of Mercur y. This fire is fed b y the air: to express its attrac tive and expansive power, no better compar ison can be used than that of the lightning, which is at first only a dry and earthl y exhalation, united to the moist vapor, but which, by self- exhalation, takes a fiery nature, acts on the humid ity inherent in it, which it attracts to itself and transmutes in its nature; after which it precipita tes itself rapidly toward the earth, whither it is attracted by a fixed nature like unto its own. These words, in form enigma tic, but clear at bottom, distinctl y express what the philosophers mean by their Mercur y, fecundated by Sulphur, and which beco mes the Master and regenerator of the Salt. It is the AZOTH, the universal magnetic force, the grand magica l agent, the Astral light, the light of life, fecundated by the men tal force, the intellectual energy, which they compare to sulphur, on account of its affinit ies with the Divine fire. As to the Salt, it is Absolute Matter. Whatever is matter contains salt; and all salt [nitre] may be converted into pure gold b y the combin ed action of Sulphur and Mercury , which sometimes act so rapidl y, that the transmu tation may be effected in an instant, in an hour, without fatigue to the operator, and almost without expense. At other times, and according to the more refractor y temper of the atmospheri c media , the operation requires several days, several months, and sometimes even several years. Two prim ary laws exist in nature, two essential laws, which produce, by counterbalancing each other, the universal equilibriu m of things. These are fixedness and movem ent, analogous, in philosoph y, to Truth and Fiction, and, in Absolute Conception, to Necessity Page 559 of 621"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike and Liberty, which are the ver y essence of Deity . The Hermet ic philosophers gave the name fixed to everything ponder-able, to ever ything that tends by its natural to central repose and immobility; they term volatile everything that more naturall y and more readily obeys the law of move ment; and the y form their stone b y analysis, that is to say , by the volatilization of the Fixed, and then by synthesis, that is, by fixing the volatil e, which the y effect by applying to the fixed, which they call their salt, the sulphurated Mercury , or the light of life, directed and made omnipoten t by a Sovereign Will. Thus the y master entire Nature, and their stone is found wherever there is salt, which is the reason for say ing that no substance is foreign to the Great Work, and that even the most despicable and apparentl y vile matters may be changed into gold, which is true in this sen se, that they all contain the original salt-principle, represented in our emble ms by the cubical stone. To know how to extract from all matter the pure salt concealed in it, is to have the Secret of the Stone. Wherefore this is a Saline stone, which the Od or universal astral light decomposes or re-compounds: it is single and manifo ld; for it ma y be dissolved like ordinar y salt, and incorporated with other substances. Obtained by analysis, we might term it the Universal Sublimate : found by way of synthesis, it is the true panacea of the ancients, for it cures all maladies of soul and body , and has been st yled, par-excellen ce , the medicine of all nature. When one, by absolute initiation, comes to control the forces of the universal agent, he alwa ys has this stone at his disposal, for its extraction is then a simple and easy operation, very distinct from the me tallic projection or realiza tion. This stone, when in a state of sublimation, must not be exposed to contact with the atmospher ic air, which might partiall y dissolve it and deprive it of its virtue; nor could its emanat ions be inhaled without danger. The Sage prefers to preserve it in its natural envelopes, assured as he is of extracting it by a single effort of his will, and a single applicat ion of the Universal Agent to the envelopes, which the Kabalists call cortices , the shells, bark, or integum ents. Hierogl yphically to express this law of prudence, they gave their Mercury , personified in Egypt as Hermanubis, a dog's head; and to their Sulphur, represented by the Baphome t of the Temple, that goat's head which brought into such disrepute the occult Mediæval associations. Let us listen for a few mom ents to the Alchemists themselv es, and endeavor to learn the hidden meaning of their mysterious words. The RITUAL of the Degree of Scottish Elder MASTER, and Knight of Saint Andrew, being the fourth Degree of Ramsa y, it is said upon the title- page, or of the Reformed or Rectified Rite of Dresden, has these passages: \"O how great and glorious is the presence of the Almight y God w hich gloriously shines from between the Cherubim! \"How adorable and astonishing are the rays of that glorious Light , that sends forth its bright and brillian t beams from the Holy Ark of Alliance and Covenant! \"Let us with the deepest veneration and devotion adore the great Source of Life, that Glorious Spirit who is the Most Merciful and Beneficent Ruler of the Universe and of all the creatures it contains!

The first of these produces Solidity , the second Softness , and the third the Spiritual , vaporous particles. These three compound substances work potentl y together; and therein consists the true process for the transmuta tion of meta ls. \"To these three substances allude the three golden basins, in the first of which was engraved the letter M ∴ , in the second, the letter G ∴ , and in the third nothing. The first, M ∴ , is the initia l letter of the Hebrew word Malakh , which signifies Salt ; and the second, G ∴ , of the Hebrew word Gepa raith , which signifies Sulphur ; and as there is no w ord in Hebrew to express the vaporous and intangible Spirit , there is no letter in the third basin. \"With these three principal substances you may effect the transmu tation of metals, which must be done b y means of the five points or rules of the Scottish Mastership. \"The first Master's point show s us the Brazen Sea, wherein must always be rain-water; and out of this rain- water the Scottish Masters extract the first substance, which is Salt; which salt must afterward undergo a seven- fold manipulation and purification, before it will be properl y prepared. This seven-fold purificat ion is symbolized by the Seven Steps of Solomon's Temple, which symbol is furnished us by the first point or rule of the Scottish Masters. \"After preparing the first substance, you are to extract the second, Sulphur, out of the purest gold, to which must then be added the purified or celestial Salt.

This is the second point or rule of the Scottish Masters.\" If you reflect, my Brother, that it was impossible for any one to imagin e that either common salt or nitre could be extracted from rain-water, or sulphur from pure gold, you will no doubt suspect that some secret me aning was concealed in these words. The Kabalah considers the i mmaterial part of man as threefold, consisting of NEP HESCH, RUACH, and NESCHAMAH, Psyche , Spiritus , and Mens , or Soul , Spirit , and Intelle ct . There are Seven Holy Palaces, Seven Heavens and Seven Thrones; and Souls are purified by ascending through Seven Spheres. A Ship , in Hebrew, is Ani ; and the same word means I , Me , or Myself . The RITUAL continues: \"Multipl ying the substance thus obtained, is the third operation, which is done by adding to them the animate, volatile Spirit ; which is done by means of the water of the Celestial Salt, Page 561 of 621"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike as well as by the Salt, which must daily be added to it very carefull y, and strictl y observing to put neither too mu ch nor too litt le; inasmuch as, if you add too much, you will destroy that growing and mu ltiplying substance; and if too littl e, it will be self-consumed and destroyed, and shrink away , not having sufficient substantiali ty for its preservation. This third point or rule of the Scottish Masters gives us the emblem of the building of the Tower of Babel, used by our Scottish Masters, because b y irregulari ty and want of due proportion and harmon y that work wa s stopped; and the workmen could proceed no further. \"Next comes the fourth operation, represented by the Cubical Stone, whose faces and angles are all equal. As soon as the work is brought to the necessar y point of multiplication, it is to be submitted to the third Degree of Fire, wherein it will receive the due proportion of the strength and substance of the metallic particles of the Cubical Stone; and this is the fourth point or rule of the Scottish Masters. \"Finally, we com e to the fifth and last operation, indicated to us by the Flaming Star. After the work ha s become a duly-proportioned substance, it is to be subjected to the fourth and strongest Degree of fire, wherein it must remain three times twenty-seven hours; until it is thoroughl y glowing, b y which means it becomes a bright and shining tincture, wherewith the lighter metals may be changed, by the use of one part to a thousand of the metal.

You ma y then in reality say that your age is a thousand y ears.\" In the oration of the Degree, the following hints are given as to its true meaning : \"The three divisions of the Temple, the Outer Court, Sanctuar y, and Hol y of Holies, signify the three Principles of our Holy Order, which direct to the knowledge of morali ty, and teach those most practica l virtues that ought to be practised by mankind. Therefore the Seven Steps w hich lead up to the Outer Court of the Temple, are the emb lem of the Seven- fold Light which we need to possess, before we can arrive at the height of knowledge, in which consist the ulti mate limits of our order. \"In the Brazen Sea we are s ymbolically to purif y ourselves from all pollutions, all faults and wrongful actions, as well those com mitted through error of j udgmen t and mistaken opinion, as those intentiona lly done; inasmu ch as they equally prevent us from arriving at the knowledge of True Wisdom. We must thoroughl y cleanse and purif y our hearts to their inmost recesses, before we can of right contemp late that Flaming Star , which is the emblem of the Divine and Glorious Shekinah, or presence of God; before we may dare approach the Throne of Supreme Wisdom.\" In the Degree of The True Mason [ Le Vrai Maçon ], styled in the title- page of its Ritual the 23d Degree of Masonry, or the 12th of the 5th class, the Tracing-board displays a luminous Triangle, with a great Y d in the centre. ō \"The Triangle,\" says the Ritual, \"represents one God in three Persons; and th e great Y d is ō the initial letter of the last word.

The hangings are black, and over that crimson. Over the throne is a great Eagle, in gold, on a black ground. In the centre of the Canopy the Blazing Star in gold, with the letter Y d in its centre.

The hall and ante-room are each lighted by ten lights, and a single one at the entrance. The colors, black, white, and crimson appear in the clothing; and the Key and Balance are among the symbols. The duty of the Second Grand Prior, say s the Ritual, is \"to see if the Chapter is hermetically sealed; whether the ma terials are read y, and the elements; whether the Black gives place to the White, and the White to the Red.\" \"Be laborious,\" it says, \"like the Star, and procure the light of the Sages, and hide yourself from the Stupid Profane and the Ambitious, and be like the Owl, which sees onl y by night, and hides itself from treacherous curiosit y.\" \"The Sun, on entering each of his hou ses, should be received there by the four ele ments, which you must be careful to invite to acco mpany you, that they may aid you in your undertaking; for without the m the House would be melan choly: wherefore y ou will give him to feast upon the four ele ments. \"When he shall have visited his twelve houses, and seen yo u attentive there to receive him, you will becom e one of his chiefest favorites, and he will allow you to share all his gifts.

This is effected by the use of the philosophical SALT, that is to say, of WIS DOM; of MERCUR Y, that is to sa y, of personal aptitude and labor; and of SULPH UR, which represents the vital energy , and the ardor of the will.

It even appears where Masons do not su spect it; to teach the doctrine of the equilibriu m of Contraries, and the resultant Harmon y. The double triangle of Solomon is explained by Saint John in a remarkab le manner: There are, he says, three witnesses in Heaven, – the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and three witnesses on earth, – the breath, water, and blood. He thus agrees with the Masters of the Hermet ic Philosoph y, who give to their Sulphur the name of Ether, to their Mercury the name of philosophical water, to their Salt that of blood of the dragon, or menstruu m of the earth.

The Principle of all things is called the House of all things: wherefore Y d is ō the beginning and end of all things; as it is written: \" Thou halt made all things in W isdom .\" For The All is term ed Wisdom ; and in it The All is contained; and the summary of all things is the Holy Name. Y d, ō says the Siphra de Zeniutha , signify ing the Father, approaches the letter He, which is the Mother; and by the comb ination of these two is denoted that luminous influence wherewith Binah is i mbued by the Supernal Wisdo m. In the name יהו , says the same, are included the Father, Mother, and Microprosopo s, their issue. He, impr egnated by Vau, produced Microprosopos, or Seir Anpin. Wisdom, Hakemah, is the Principle of all things: it is the Father of Fathers, and in it are the beginning and end of all things. Microprosopos, the second Universal, is the issue of Wisdom, the Father, and Binah, the Mother, and is composed of the six Numerat ions, Geburah, Gedulah, and Tephareth, Netsach, H d ō , and Yesod; is represented under the form of a man, and said to have at first occupied the place afterward filled by the world Briah [of Creation], but afterward to have been raised to the Aziluthic sphere, and received Wisdom, Intelligenc e, and Cognition [Daath] from the Supernal Wisdo m and Intellectuality.

All things are one: all was, all is, all will be: there neither will be, nor is, nor has been, mut ation. But He conformed Himself, by the formings, into a form that contains all forms, in a form which comprehends all genera. This form is in the likeness of His form; and is not that form but its analogue: wherefore the human form is the form of all above and below, which are included in it: and because it embraces all above and below. The Most Hol y so took form, and so Microprosopo s was configured. All things are equall y one, in each of the two Universals; but in the second His ways are divided, and judgment is on our side, and on the side that looks toward us, also, they differ. These Secrets are made known only to the reapers in the Holy Field. The Most Holy Ancient is not called ATHAH, Thou, but Hun, He: but in Microprosopos, where is the beginning of things, He has the name ATHAH, and also AB, Father. From Him is the beginning, and He is called Thou, and is the Father of Fathers. He issues from the Non-Ens; and therefore is beyond cognition. Wisdom is the Principle of the Universe, and from it thirty-two way s diverge: and in them the law is contained, in twenty -two letters and ten words. Wisdom is the Father of Fathers, and in this Wisdom is found the Beginning and the End: wherefore there is a wisdom in each Universal, one above, the other below. The Commentary of Rabbi Chajun Vital , on the Siphra de Zeniutha , says: At the beginning of emanation, Microprosopos is sued from the Father , and was inter mingled with the Mother, under the m ysteries of the letter, ה [He], resolved in דו , that is, Daleth and Vau; by which Vau is denoted Microprosopos: because Vau is six, and he is constituted of the six parts that follow Hakemah and Binah. And, according to this conception, the Father is called Father of Fathers, because from Him these Fathers proceed, Benignit y, Severit y, and Beauty. Microprosopos wa s then like the letter Vau in the letter He, because He had no head; but when He was now born, three brains were constituted for Him, by the flow of Divine Light from above. And as the world of restitut ion [after the vessels of the Sephiroth below Binah had been broken, that from the fragm ents evil might be created] is instituted after the fashion of the Balance, so also is it formed throughout in the human form. But Malakoth, Regnu m, is a complete and separate person, behind Microprosopo s, and in conjunction with him, and the two are called man. The first world [of Inanit y] could not continue and did not sub sist, because it had no human conforma tion nor the system of the Balance, the Sephiroth being points, one below the other. The first Adam [Microprosopos, as distinguished from Macroprosopos, the first Occult Adam] was the beginning, wherein the ten Numera tions proceeded forth from potence into act. Microprosopos is the second garment or interposed medium, with respect to the Elder Most Holy , who is the nam e Tetragra mmaton; and he is called Alohim; because the former Page 572 of 621"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike is Absolute Comm iseration; while in Macropro sopos his lights have the nature of Severities, with respect to the elder Universal; though the y are Comm iseration, with respect to the lights of Malakoth and the three lower worlds. All the conform ations of Macroprosopos come from the first Adam; who, to interpose a second covering, caused a single spark to issue from the sphere of Severit y, of whose five letters is generated the nam e Alohim. With this issued from the brain a most subtle air, which takes its place on the right hand, while the spark of fire is on the left. Thus the white and red do not inter mix, that is, the Air and Fire, which are Mercy and Judgment. Microprosopos is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, his Severities being the Evil. REGNU M, to which is given the name of Word of The Lord, superinvests Heaven, as the six members of the Degree Tephareth are called, and these beco me and are constituted by that superior vestiture. For every conforma tion and constitution is effected by means of veiling, because occultat ion here is the same as manifest ation, the excess of light being veiled, so that, diminished in intensit y and degree, it may be received by those below. Those six mem bers conceived of as contained in Binah, are said to be in the World of Creation; as in Tephareth, in that of Formation; and as in Malakoth, in that of Fabrication. Before the institut ion of equilibriu m, face was not toward face: Microprosopos and his wife issuing forth back to back, and y et cohering. So above; before the prior Adam was conform ed into male and fem ale, and the state of equilibriu m established, the Father and Mother were not face to face. For the Father denotes the most perfect Love; and the Mother the most perfect Rigor. And the seven supernal sons who proceeded from her, from Binah, who brought forth seven, were all most perfect rigors, having no connection with a root in the Most Holy Ancient; that is, they were all dead , destro yed, shattered ; but they were placed in equilibrium , in the equipoise of the Occult Wisdom, when it was conformed into male and fem ale, Rigor and Love, and the y were then restored, and there was given them a root above. The Father is Love and Merc y, and with a pure and subtle Aur or Benignit y impregnates the Mother, who is Rigor and Severit y of Judgments; and the product is the brain of Microprosopos. It was determined, says the Introduction to the Book Sohar , by the Deit y, to create Good and Evil in the world, according to what is said in Isaiah, \" who makes the bight and creates the Evil .\" But the Evil was at first occult, and could not be generated and brought forth, except by the sinning of the First Adam. Wherefore He determined that the numerations first emanated, from Benignit y downward, should be destroy ed and shattered by the excessive influx of His Light; His intention being to create of them the worlds of Evils. But the first three were to remain and sub sist, that among the fragments should be neither Will, Intellectu al Power, nor the Capacit y of Intellec tion of the Divinit y. The last seven num erations were points , like the first three, each subsisting independentl y, unsustained by companionship ; which was the cause of their dying and being shattered. Page 573 of 621"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike There was then no Love between them, but only a two-fold Fear; Wisdom, for examp le, fearing lest it should ascend again to its Source in Kether; and also lest it should descend into Binah. Hence there was no union between an y two, except Hakemah and Binah, and this imperfe ct, with averted faces. This is the mean ing of the saying, that the world was created by Judgmen t, which is fear. And so that world could not sub sist, and the Seven Kings were dethroned, until the attribute of Compassion was adjoined to it, and then restoration took place. Thence came Love and Union, and six of the parts were united into one person; for Love is the attribute of Compassion or Mercy . Binah produced the Seven Kings, not successivel y, but all together. The Seventh is Regnum, called a stone, the corner- stone, because on it are builded the palaces of the three lower worlds. The first six were shattered into fragmen ts; but Regnum was crushed into a formless mass, lest the malignan t demons created from the fragments of the others should receive bodies from it, since from it came bodies and vitali ty [Nephesch]. From the fragmen ts of the vessels ca me all Evils; judgments, turbid waters, impuri ties, the Serpent, and Adam Belial [Baal]. But their internal light re-ascended to Binah, and then flowed down again into the worlds Briah and Yezirah, there to form vestiges of the Seven Numera tions. The Sparks of the great Influence of the shattered vases descending into the four spiritual elemen ts, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, and thence into the inani mate, vegetable, living, and speaking kingdoms, became Souls. Selecting the suitable from the unsuitable lights, and separating the good from the evil, the Deity first restored the universalit y of the Seven Kings of the World Aziluth, and afterward the three other Worlds. And though in them were both good and evil, still this evil did not develop itself in act, since the Severities remained, though mi tigated; some portion of them being necessar y to prevent the fragments of the integu ments from ascending. These were also left, because connection of two is necessary to generation. And this necessit y for the existence of Severity is the mystery of the pleasure and warmth of the generative appetite; and thence Love between husband and wife. If the Deity, says the Introduction, had not created worlds and then destro yed them, there could have been no evil in the world, but all things must have been good. There would have been neither reward nor punishment in the world. There would have been no mer it in righteousness, for the Good is kno wn by the evil, nor would there have been fruitfulness or m ultiplica tion in the world. If all carnal concupiscence were enchained for three da ys in the mouth of the great abyss, the egg of one of the da ys would be wanting to the sick man. In time to come it will be called Laban [ לבן – white ], because it will be whitened of its impurity, and will return to the realm Israel, and the y will pra y the Lord to give the m the appetite of carnal concupiscence, for the begetting of children. The intention of God was, w hen He created the world, that His creatures should recognize His existence. Therefore He created evils, to afflict them withal when they should sin, and Page 574 of 621"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Light and Blessing to reward the just. And therefore man necessaril y has free-will and election, since Good and Evil are in the World. And these kings died, says the Commentary , because the condition of equilibrium did not yet exist, nor was Adam Kadmon formed male and female. They were not in contact with what was alive: nor had any root in Adam Kadmon; nor wa s Wisdom which outflowed from Him, their root, nor did they connect with it. For all these were pure merci es and most simple Love; but those were rigorous judgments. Whence face looked not toward face; nor the Father toward the Mother, because from her proceeded judgmen ts. Nor Macroprosopos toward Microprosopos. A nd Regnum, the last numera tion, was empty and inane. It has nothing of itself; and, as it were, was nothing, receiving nothing from them. Its need was, to receive Love from the Male; for it is mere rigor and judgment ; and the Love and Rigor must temper each other, to produce creation, and its mul titudes above and below. For it was made to be inhabited; and when rigorous j udgmen ts rule in it, it is inane because its processes cannot be carried on. Wherefore the Balance must needs be instituted, that there might be a root above, so that judgments might be restored and tempered, and live and not again die. And Seven Conforma tions descend; and all things beco me in equilibrium , and the needle of the Balance is the root above. In the world Yezirah, says the Pneumatica Kabalistica , י de-notes Kether; יה , Hakem ah and Binah; and יהו , Gedulah, Geburah, and Tephareth; and thus Vau is Beaut y and Harmon y. The Man is Hakemah; the Eagle , Binah; the Lion , Gedulah; and the Ox , Geburah. And the mysterious circle is thus formed by the Sohar and all the Kabalists: Michael and the face of the Lion are on the South, and the right hand, with the letter י , Yōd, and W ater; Gabriel and the face of the Ox, on the North, and left hand, with the first ה of the Tetragra mmaton and Fire; Uriel and the face of the Eagle, on the East and forward, with ו and Air; and Raphael and the face of the Man, on the West, and backward with the last ה , and Earth. In the same order, the four letters represent the four worlds. Rabbi Schimeon Ben Jochai says that the four anima ls of the M ysterious Chariot, whose wheels are Netsach and Had, are Gedulah, whose face is the Lion's; Geburah, with that of the Ox; Tephareth, with that of the Eagle; and Malakoth, with that of the Man. The Seven lower Sephiroth, says the Æsch Meza reph , will represent Seven Metals; Gedulah and Geburah, Silver and Gold; Tephareth, Iron; Netsach and H d ō , Tin and Copper; Yesod, Lead; and Malakoth will be the me tallic Woman and Morn of the Sages, the field wherein are to be sowed the Seeds of the Secret Minerals, to wit, the Water of Gold; but in these such mysteries are concealed as no tongue can utter. The word אמש , Amas, is composed of the initia ls of the three Hebrew word s that signify Air, Water, and Fire; b y which, say the Kabalists, are denoted Benignit y, Judicial Rigor, a nd Mercy or Compassion mediating between them. Malakoth, says the Apparatus , is called Haikal , Temple or Palace, because it is the Palace of the Degree Tephareth, which is concealed and contained in it, and Haikal denotes the place in which all things are contained. Page 575 of 621"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike For the better understanding of the Kabalah, remember that Kether, or the Crown, is treated of as a person, composed of the ten Numera tions, and as such ter med Arik Anpin, or Macroprosopos: That Hakemah is a person, and ter med Abba , or Father : That Binah is a person, and ter med Mother , Imma : That Tephareth, including all the Numera tions from Khased or Gedulah to Yesod, is a person, called Seir Anpin, or Microprosopos. These Numerat ions are six in number, and are represented by the interla ced triangle, or the Seal of Solomon. And Malakoth is a person, and called the wife of Microprosopos. Vau represents the Beauty or Harmon y, consisting of the six parts w hich constitute Seir Anpin. The wife, Malakoth, is said to be behind the husband, Seir, and to have no other cognition of him. And this is thus explained: That every cognizable object is to be known in two ways: à priori , which is when it is known by means of its cause, or of itself; or, à posteriori when it is known b y its effects. The most nearly perfect mode of cognition is, when the intellec t knows the thing itself, in itself, and through itself. But if it knows the thing by its simi litude or idea, or species separate from it, or b y its effects and operations, the cognition is much feebler and more imperfe ct. And it is thus only that Regnum, the wife of Seir, know s her husband, until face is turned to face, when they unite, and she has the more nearly perfect knowledge. For then the Deity, as limited and manifested in Seir and the Universe are one. Vau is Tephareth, considered as the Unity in which are the six mem bers, of which itself is one. Tephareth, Beauty, is the colu mn which supports the world, symbolized by the column of the junior Warden in the Blue Lodges. The world was first created by Judgment: and as it could not so s ubsist, Merc y was conjoined with Judgmen t, and the Divine Mercies sustain the Universe. God, say s the Idra Suta , formed all things in the form of male and femal e, since otherwise the continuance of things wa s impossible. The All-embr acing Wisdom, issuing and shining from the Most Holy Ancient, shines not otherwise than as male and fem ale. Wisdom as the Father, Intelligenc e the Mother, are in equilibrium as male and fema le, and they are conjoined, and one shines in the other. Then they generate, and are expanded in the Truth. Then the two are the Perfection of all things, when they are coupled; and when the Son is in them, the summ ary of all things is in one. These things are intrusted only to the Holy Superiors, w ho have entered and gone out and known the ways of the Most Hol y God, so as not to err in them, to the right hand or to the left: For these things are hidden; and the loft y Holinesses shine in the m, as light flows from the splendor of a la mp.

A MIRACULOU S tradition, something like that connected with the labaru m of Constantine, hallows the Ancient Cross of St. Andrew. Hungu s, who in the ninth century reigned over the Picts in Scotland, is said to have seen in a vision, on the night before a battle, the Apostle Saint Andrew, who promised him the victor y; and for an assured token thereof, he told him that there should appear over the Pictish host, in the air, such a fashioned cross as he had suffered upon. Hungu s, awakened, looking up at the sky, saw the promised cross, as did all of both armi es; and Hungus and the Picts, after rendering thanks to the Apostle for their victory, and making their offerings with humble devotion, vowed that from thenceforth, as well the y as their posterit y, in time of war, would wear a cross of St. Andrew for their badge and cognizance. John Leslie, Bishop of Ros s, says that this cross appeared to Achaius, King of the Scots, and Hungus, King of the Picts, the night before the battle was fought betwixt the m and Athelstane, King of England, as they were on their knees at prayer. Every cross of Knighthood is a symbol of the nine qualities of a Knight of St. A ndrew of Scotland; for every order of chivalr y required of its votaries the same virtues and the same excellen cies. Humility, Patience, and Self- denial are the three essential qualities of a Knight of St. Andrew of Scotland. The Cross, sanctified by the blood of the holy ones who have died upon it; the Cross, which Jesus of Nazareth bore, fainting, along the streets of Jeru salem and up to Calvar y, upon w hich He cried, \"Not My will, O Father! but Thine be done,\" is an unmistakable and eloquent symbol of these three virtues. He suffered upon it, because He consorted with and taught the poor and lowl y, and found Hi s disciples among the fisherm en of Galilee and the despised publicans. His life was one of H umility, Patience, and Self-denial. The Hospitallers and Temp lars took upon the mselves vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. The Lamb, which beca me the device of the Seal of the Order of the Poor Fellow Soldier y of the Temple of Solomon, conveyed the same lessons of humil ity and self-denial Page 578 of 621"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike as the original device of two Knights riding a single horse. The Grand Com mander warned every candidate not to be induced to enter the Order by a vain hope of enjoy ing earthly pomp and splendor. He told him that he would have to endure many things, sorely against his inclina tions; and that he would be compe lled to give up his o wn will, and submi t entirely to that of his superiors. The religious Houses of the Hospitallers, despoiled by Henry the Eighth's worthy daughter, Elizabeth, because they would not take the oath to maintain her suprema cy, had been Alms-houses, and Dispensaries, and Foundling- asyla, relieving the State of man y orphan and outcast children, and minist ering to their necessities, God's ravens in the wilderness, bread and flesh in the morning, bread and flesh in the evening. They had been Inns to the wayfaring man, who heard from afar the sound of the Vesper-bell, inviting him to repose and devotion at once, and who might sing his m atins with the Morning Star, and go on his way rejoicing. And the Knights were no less distinguished by bravery in battle, than by tenderness and zeal in their ministrations to the sick and d ying. The Knights of St. Andrew vo wed to defend all orphans, ma idens, and widows of good family, and wherever they heard of murder ers, robbers, or masterful thieves who oppressed the people, to bring the m to the laws, to the best of their power. \"If fortune fail you,\" so ran the vows of Rouge-Croix, \"in divers lands or countries wherever you go or ride that you find any gentlem an of name and arms, which hath lost goods, in worship and Knighthood, in the King's service, or in any other place of worship, and is fallen into povert y, you shall aid, and support, and succor him, in that you may; and he ask of you your goods to his sustenance, you shall give him part of such goods as God hath sent you to your power, and as you may bear.\" Thus CHARITY and GENERO SITY are even more essential qualities of a true and gentle Knight, and have been so in all ages; and so also hath CLEMENCY. It is a mark of a noble nature to spare the conquered. Valor is then best temp ered, when it can turn out a stern fortitude into the mild strains of pit y, which never shines more brightl y than when she is clad in steel. A mart ial man, compassionate, shall conquer both in peace and war; and b y a twofold way, get victor y with honor. The most famed men in the world have had in them both courage and compassion. An enem y reconciled hath a greater value than the long train of captives of a Roman triumph. VIRTUE, TRUTH, and HONOR are the three MOST essential qualities of a Knight of St. Andrew. \"Ye s hall love God above all things, and be steadfast in the Faith,\" it was said to the Knights, in their charge, \"and ye shall be true unto your Sovereign Lord, and true to your word and promise. Also, ye shall sit in no place where that any judgment should be given wrongfully against any body, to your knowledge.\" The law hath not power to strike the virtuous, nor can fortune subvert the wise. Virtue and Wisdom, only, perfect and defend man. Virtue' s garment is a sanctuar y so sacred, that even Princes dare not strike the man that is thus robed. It is the liver y of the King of Heaven. It protects us when we are unarmed ; and is an armor that we cannot lose, unless we be false to ourselves. It is the tenure by which we hold of Heaven, without which we are but Page 579 of 621"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike outlaws, that cannot claim protection. Nor is there wisdom without virtue, but only a cunning way of procuring our own undoing. Peace is nigh Where Wisdom's voice has found a lis tening heart. Amid the howl of more than winter storms, The halcyon hears the voice of vernal hours, Already on the wing. Sir Launcelo t thought no chivalr y equal to that of Virtue. This word means not continenc e only, but chiefl y manliness, and so includes what in the old English was called souffrance , that patient endurance which is like the emerald, ever green and flowering; and also that other virtue, droicture , uprightness, a virtue so strong and so puissant, that by means of it all earthly things almost attain to be unchangeable. Even our swords are formed to remind us of the Cross, and y ou and an y other of us ma y live to show how much men bear and do not die; for this world is a place of sorrow and tears, of great evils and a constant calamity, and if we w ould win true honor in it, we must permit no virtue of a Knight to become unfamiliar to us, as men's friends, coldl y entreated and not greatl y valued, become mere ordinar y acquaintanc es. We must not view with impa tience or anger those who in jure us; for it is ver y inconsistent with philosophy , and particular ly with the Divine Wisdom that should govern every Prince Adept, to betra y any great concern about the evils which the world, which the vulgar, whether in robes or tatters, can inflict upon the brave. The favor of God and the love of our Brethren rest upon a basis w hich the strength of malice cannot overthrow; and with these and a generous temp er and noble equanim ity, we have ever ything. To be consistent with our professions as Ma sons, to retain the dignit y of our nature, the consciousness of our own honor, the spirit of the high chivalr y that is our boast, we must disdain the evils that are only material and bodil y, and therefore can be no bigger than a blow or a cozenage, than a wound or a dream. Look to the ancient days, Sir E – – – -, for excellen t examples of VIRTUE, TRUTH, and HONOR, and im itate with a noble emulation the Ancient Knights, the first Hospitallers and Templars, and Bay ard, and Sydney, and Saint Louis; in the words of Pliny to his friend Maximus, Revere the ancient glory, and that old age which in man is venerable, in cities sacred.

If those who no w pretend to be the great and mighty, the learned and wise of the world, shall agree in condemn ing the memory of the heroic Knights of former ages, and in charging with foll y us who think that they should be held in eternal remembrance, and that we should defend them from an evil hearing, do you remember that if these who no w claim to rule and teach the world should condemn or scorn yo ur poor tribute of fidelit y, still it is for you to bear therewith modest ly, and yet not to be ashamed, since a da y will com e when these who now scorn those who were of infinite ly higher and finer natures than they are, will be pronounced to have lived poor and pitiful lives, and the world will make haste to forget them.

Destruction was denounced by the Prophets against Tyre and Sidon, Baby lon, and Damascus, and Jeru salem, as a consequence of the sins of their people; but if fire now consumes or earthquake shatters or the tornado crushes a great cit y, those are scoffed at as fanatics and sneered at for indulging in cant, or rebuked for Pharisaic uncharitabl eness, who venture to believe and say that there are divine retributions and God' s judgment in the ruin wrought by His mighty agencies.

It will not see that the Forces of Nature are the varied actions of God. Hence it becomes antagonistic to all Religion, and to all the old Faith that has from the beginning illuminated human souls and constituted their consciousnes s of their own dignit y, their divine origin, and their immortality; that Faith which is the Light by which the human soul is enabled, as it were, to see itself. It is not one religion only, but the basis of all religions, the Truth that is in all religions, even the religious creed of Masonry , that is in danger. For all religions have owed all of life that they have had, and their very being, to the foundation on which they were reared; the proposition, deemed undeniable and an axiom, that the Providence of God rules directly in all the affairs and changes of mater ial things. The Science of the age has its hands upon the pillars of the Te mple, and rocks it to its foundation. As yet its destructive efforts have but torn from the ancient structure the worm- eaten fret-work of s uperstition, and shaken down some incoherent additions – owl-inhabited turrets of ignorance, and massive props that supported nothing. The structure itself will be overthrown, w hen, in the vivid language of a living writer, \"Human reason leaps into the throne of God and waves her torch over the ruins of the Universe.\" Science deals only with phenomena, and is but charlatan ism when it babbles about the powers or causes that produce these, or what the things are, in essence, of which it gives us merely the names. It no more knows w hat Light or Sound or Perfume is, than the Aryan cattle-herders did, when the y counted the Dawn and Fire, Flame and Light and Heat as gods. And that Atheistic Science is not even half-science, which ascribes the Universe and its powers and forces to a system of natural laws or to an inherent energy of Nature, or to causes unknown, existing and operating independent ly of a Divine and Supra-natural power. That theory would be greatl y fortified, if science were alway s capable of protecting life and property , and, with anything like the certainty of which it boasts, securing human interests even against the destructive agencies that man himself develops in his endeavors to subserve the m. Fire, the fourth element, as the old philosophers dee med it, is his most useful and abject servant. Why cannot man prevent his ever breaking that ancient indenture, old as Prometheus, old as Adam? Why can he not be certain that at any moment his terrible subject may not break forth and tower up into his master, tyrant, destroyer? It is because it also is a power of nature; which, in ultimate trial of forces, is alwa ys superior to man. It is also because, in a different sense from that in which it is the servant of man, it is the servant of Him Who makes His min isters a flame of fire, and Who is over nature, as nature is over man. There are powers of nature which man does not even attempt to check or control. Naples does nothing against Vesuvius. Valparaiso only trembles with the tre mbling earth before the coming earthquake. The sixty thousand people who went down alive into the grave when Lisbon buried her population under both earth and sea had no kno wledge of the causes, and no possible control over the power, that effected their destruction.

And those daring fire- brigades, with their water- artillery, his conquerors, it seemed, upon so many midnigh t fields, stand paral yzed in the presence of their conqueror. In other matters relative to human safety and interests we have observed how confident science becomes upon the strength of some slight success in the war of man with nature, and how much inclined to put itself in the place of Providence, which, by the very force of the term, is the onl y absolute science. Near the beginning of this century , for instance, medical and sanitar y science had mad e, in the course of a few years, great and wonderful progress. The great plague which wasted Europe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and reappeared in the seventeenth, had been identified with a disease which yields to enlighten ed treatment, and its ancient virulence was attributed to ignorance of hygiene, and the filthy habits of a former age. Another fatal and disfiguring scourge had to a great extent been checked by the discover y of vaccination. From Sangrado to Sydenham, from Paracelsus to Jenner, the healing art had indeed taken a long stride. The Facult y might be excused had it then said, \"Man is mor tal, disease will be often fatal; but there shall be no more unresisted and unnecessary slaughter by infectious disease, no more general carnage, no more carnivals of terror and high festivals of death.\" The conceited boast would hardly have died upon the lip, when, from the mysterious depths of remotest India a spectre stalked forth, or rather a monster crept, more fearful than human eye had ever yet beheld. And not with surer instinct does the tiger of the jungles, where this terrible pestilence was born, catch the scent of blood upon the air, than did this invisible Destroyer, this fearful agent of Almight y Power, this tremendous Consequence of some Sufficient Cause, scent the tainted atmosphere of Europe and turn Westward his devastating march. The mi llions of dead left in his path through Asia proved nothing. They were unar med, ignorant, defenceless, unaided by science, undefended by art. The cholera was to the m inscrutable and irresistible as Azrael, the Angel of Death. But it came to Europe and swept the halls of science as it had swept the Indian village and the Persian khan. It leaped as noiselessly and descended as destructivel y upon the population of man y a high- towered, wide-paved, purified, and disinfected city of the Nest as upon the Pariahs of Tanjore and the filthy streets of Stamboul. In Vienna, Paris, London, the scenes of the great plague were re- enacted. The sick man started in his bed, The watcher leaped upon the floor, At the cr y, Bring out your dead, The cart is at the door! Was this the judgment of Almight y God? He would be bold who s hould say that it was; he would be bolder who s hould say it was not. To Paris, at least, that European Babylon, how often have the further words of the prophet to the daughter of the Chaldæans, the lad y of kingdoms, been fulfilled? \"Thy wisdom and thy knowledge have perverted thee, and thou Page 585 of 621"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike hast said in thy heart I am and none else beside me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know whence it riseth; and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off; desolation shall come upon thee suddenly .\" And as to London – it looked like judgment, if it be true that the Asiatic cholera had its origin in English avarice and cruelty, as they suppose w ho trace it to the tax which Warren Hastings, when Governor-General of India, i mposed on salt, thus cutting off its use from millions of the vegetable- eating races of the East: just as that disease whose spectral shadow lies alwa ys upon America's threshold, originated in the avarice and cruelty of the slave-trade, translating the African coast fever to the congenial climate of the West Indies and Southern America – the yellow fever of the former, and the vomito negro of the latter. But we should be slow to make inferences from our pett y human logic to the ethics of the Almigh ty. Whatever the cruelt y of the slave-trade, or the severit y of slavery on the continents or islands of America, we should still, in regard to its supposed consequences, be wiser, perhaps, to say with that great and simpl e Casuist Who gave the world the Christian religion: \"Suppo se ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things? or those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem?\" Retribution bars retaliat ion, even in word s. A city shattered, burned, destro yed, desolate, a land wasted, humiliated, made a desert and a wilderness, or wearing the thorny crown of humiliation and subjugation, is invested with the sacred prerogatives and im munities of the dead. The base human revenge of exultation at its fall and ruin should shrink back abashed in the presence of the infinit e Divine chastisemen t. \"Forgiveness is wiser than revenge,\" our Freem asonry teaches us, \"and it is better to love than to hate.\" Let him who sees in great calamities the hand of God, be silent, and fear His judgments. Men are great or small in stature as it pleases God. But their nature is great or smal l as it pleases themselv es. Men are not born, s ome with great souls and some with litt le souls. One by taking thought cannot add to his stature, but he can enlarge his soul. B y an act of the will he can mak e himself a mora l giant, or dwarf himself to a pigmy. There are two natures in m an, the higher and the lower, the great and the mean, the noble and the ignoble; and he can and must, by his own voluntar y act, identif y himself with the one or with the other. Freemasonr y is continual effort to exalt the nobler nature over the ignoble, the spiritual over the material, the divine in man over the human. In this great effort and purpose the chivalric Degrees concur and co-operate with those that teach the magnificent lessons of moral ity and philosophy . Magnanim ity, mercy, clemency, a forgiving temper, are virtues indispensable to the character of a perfect Knight. When the low and evil principle in our nature says, \"Do not give; reserve y our beneficence for impoverished friends, or at least unobjectionable strangers, Do not bestow it on successful enemies, – friends only in virtue, of our misfortun es,\" the diviner principle whose voice spake b y the despised Galilean says, \"Do good to the m that hate you, for if y e love them (only) who love you, what reward have you?

To find a stable medium between these two aby sses, the idea of the Christian Hierophants was to create a societ y devoted to abnegation by solemn vows, protected by severe regulations; which should be recruited by initiation, and which, sole depositar y of the great religious and social secrets, should make Kings and Pontiffs, without exposing it to the corruptions of Power. In that was the secret of that kingdom of Jesus Christ, which, without being of this world, would govern all its grandeurs. \"This idea presided at the foundation of the great religious orders, so often at war with the secular authorities, ecclesiastica l or civil. Its realization was also the drea m of the dissident sects of Gnostics or Illu minati who pretended to connect their faith with the primitive tradition of the Christiani ty of Saint John. It at length became a menac e for the Church and Society, when a rich and dissolute Order, initiated in the mysterious doctrines of the Kabalah, seemed disposed to turn against legitimate authorit y the conservative principle of Hierarch y, and threatened the entire world with an im mense revolution. \"The Templars, whose history is so imperfe ctly known, were those terrible conspirators. In 1118, nine Knights Crusaders in the East, among whom were Geoffroi de Saint- Omer and Hugues de Pa yens, consecrated themselves to religion, and took an oath between the hands of the Patriarch of Constantinople, a See alwa ys secretly or openl y hostile to that of Rome from the time of Photius. The avowed object of the Templars was to protect the Christians who cam e to visit the Holy Places: their secret object was the re- building of the Te mple of Solomon on the mode l prophesied by Ezekiel. \"This re-building, formal ly predicted by the Judaïzing Mystics of the earlier ages, had become the secret dream of the Patriarchs of the Orient. The Temple of Solomon, re-built and consecrated to the Catholic worship would become, in effect, the Metropolis of the Universe; the East would prevail over the West, and the Patriarchs of Constantinople would posses s themselves of the Papal power. \"The Templars, or Poor Fellow- Soldiery of the Holy House of the Temple intended to be re-built, took as their models, in the Bible, the Warrior- Masons of Zorobabel, who w orked, holding the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other. Therefore it was that the Sword and the Trowel were the insignia of the Templars, who subsequentl y, as will be seen, concealed themse lves under the name of Brethren Masons . [This name, Frères Ma sons in the French, adopted by way of secret reference to the Builders of the Second Te mple, was corrupted in English into Free -Masons, a s Pythagore de Crotone was into Peter Gower of Groton in England.

The Knight of the East, and the Knight of the East and West, have in their titles secret allusions to the Templars of whom they were at first the successors. \"The secret thought of Hugues de Pa yens, in founding his Order, was not exactly to serve the ambition of the Patriarchs of Constantinople. There existed at that period in the East a Sect of Johannite Christians, who claim ed to be the only true Initiates into the real mysteries of the religion of the Saviour. They pretended to know the real history of YESUS the ANOINTED, and, adopting in part the Jewish traditions and the tales of the Talmud, they held that the facts recounted in the Evangels are but allegori es, the key of which Saint John gives, in sa ying that the world migh t be filled with the books that could be written upon the words and deeds of Je sus Christ; words which, the y thought, would be only a ridiculous exaggeration, if he were not speaking of an allegor y and a legend, that might be varied and prolonged to infinity. \"The Johannites ascribed to Saint John the foundation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of the Sect assumed the title of Christos , Anointed , or Consecrated , and claimed to have succeeded one another from Saint John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifica l powers. He w ho, at the period of the foundation of the Order of the Temple, claimed these imagin ary prerogatives, was named THEOCLET; he knew HU GUES DE PAYENS, he initia ted him into the Mysteries and hopes of his pretended church, he seduced him by the notions of Sovereign Priesthood and Suprem e royalty, and finall y designated him as his successor. \"Thus the Order of K nights of the Te mple was at its very origin devoted to the cause of opposition to the tiara of Rome and the crowns of Kings, and the Apostolate of Kabalistic Gnosticism was vested in its chiefs. For Saint John himse lf was the Father of the Gnostics, and the current translation of his pole mic against the heretic al of his Sect and the pagans who denied that Christ was the Word, is throughout a misrepresenta tion, or misunderst anding at least, of the whole Spirit of that Evangel. \"The tendencies and tenets of the Order were enveloped in profound m ystery, and it external ly professed the most perfect orthodoxy . The Chiefs alone knew the ai m of the Order: the Subalterns followed the m without distrust. \"To acquire influence and wealth, then to intrigue, and at need to fight, to establish the Johannite or Gno stic and Kabalistic dogma, were the object and means proposed to the initiated Brethren.

All that will become the heritage of the Temple: the World will soon come to us for its Sovereigns and Pontiffs. We shall constitute the equilibriu m of the Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World. \"The Templars, like all other Secret Orders and As sociations, had two doctrines, one concealed and reserved for the Masters, which was J ohannis m; the other public, which was the Roman Catholic . Thus the y deceived the adversaries whom they sought to supplant.

Many adopted his doctrines of the two Principles, the recollec tion of which is perpetuated by the handle of the dagger and the tesserated pavement or floor of the Lodge, stupidl y called \" the Indented Tessel ,\" and represented by great hanging tassels , when it really means a tesserated floor (from the Latin tessera ) of white and black lozenges, with a necessaril y denticul ated or indented border or edging. And wherever, in the higher Degrees, the two colors w hite and black, are in juxtaposition, the two Principles of Zoroaster and Manes are alluded to. With others the doctrine became a mystic Pantheis m, descended from that of the Brahmins, and even pushed to an idolatry of Nature and hatred of every revealed dogma. [To all this the absurd reading of the established Church, taking literally the figurative, allegori cal, and mythical language of a collect ion of Oriental books of different ages, directly and inevitabl y led. The same result long after followed the foll y of regarding the Hebrew books as if the y had been written by the unimag inative, hard, practical intellect of the England of James the First and the bigoted stolidit y of Scottish Presb yterianism.] \"The better to succeed and win partisans, the Templars sympathized with regrets for dethroned creeds and encouraged the hopes of new worships, promising to all libert y of conscience and a new orthodoxy that should be the synthesis of all the persecuted creeds.\" [It is absurd to suppo se that men of intelle ct adored a monstrous idol called Baphom et, or recognized Mahomet as an inspired prophet.

The Roman de la Rose is the Epic of old France. It is a profound book, under the form of levit y, a revelation as learned as that of Apuleius, of the Mysteries of Occultis m. The Rose of Flame l, that of Jean de Meung, and that of Dante, grew on the same stem. Swedenborg' s system was nothing else than the Kabalah, m inus the principle of the Hierarch y. It is the Temple, without the keystone and the foundation. Cagliostro was the Agent of the Te mplars, and therefore wrote to the Free-Mason s of London that the time had come to begin the work of re-building the Temple of the Eternal. He had introduced into Masonry a new Rite called the Egyptian , and endeavored to resuscitate the mysterious worship of Isis.

A Lodge inaugurated under the auspices of Rousseau, the fanatic of Geneva, beca me the centre of the revolutionar y movement in France, and a Prince of the blood- royal went thither to swear the destruction of the successor s of Philippe le Bel on the tomb of Jacques de Molai. The registers of the Order of Templ ars attest that the Regent, the Duc d’Orleans, was Grand Ma ster of that formidab le Secret Society, and that his successors were the Duc de Maine, the Prince of Bourbon-Condé, and the Duc de Cossé-Brissac. The Templars compro mitted the King; the y saved him from the rage of the People, to exasperate that rage and bring on the catastrophe prepared for centuries; it was a scaffold that the vengeance of the Templars demanded. The secret movers of the French Revolution had sworn to overturn the Throne and the Altar upon the Tomb of Jacques de Molai. When Louis XVI. was executed, half the work wa s done; and thenceforward the Army of the Temple was to direct all its efforts against the Pope. Jacques de Molai and his co mpanions were perhaps martyrs, but their avengers dishonored their memory.

The peculiar and principal symbol of this Degree is the Tetract ys of Pythagoras, suspended in the East, where ordinaril y the sacred word or letter glitters, like it, representing the Deity. Its nine external points form the triangle, the chief symbol in Masonry, with many of the meanings of which you are familiar. To us, its three sides represent the three principal attributes of the Deit y, which created, and now, as ever, support, uphold, and guide the Universe in its eternal movem ent; the three supports of the Masonic Temple, itself an emb lem of the Universe: – Wisdom, or the Infinite Divine Intelligen ce; Strength, or Power, the Infinite Divine Will; and Beaut y, or the Infinite Divine Harmon y, the Eternal Law, b y virtue of which the infinite myriads of suns and worlds flash ever onward in their ceaseless revolutions, without clash or conflict, in the Infinite of space, and change and move ment are the law of all created existences. To us, as Masonic Judges, the triangle figures forth the Pyramids, which, planted firmly as the everlasting hills, and accurate ly adjusted to the four cardinal points, defiant of all assaults of m en and time, teach us to stand firm and un shaken as they , when our feet are planted upon the solid truth. It includes a multitude of geometr ical figures, all having a deep significanc e to Masons. The triple triangle is peculiarl y sacred, having ever been among all nations a symbol of the Deity. Prolonging all the external lines of the Hexagon, which also it includes, we have six smaller triangles, whose bases cut each other in the central point of the Tetract ys, itself always the symbol of the generative power of the Universe, the Sun, Brahma, Osiris, Apollo, Bel, and the Deity Himself. Thus, too, we form twelve still smaller triangles, three times three of which compose the Tetrac tys itself. I refrain from enumerating all the figures that you may trace within it: but one ma y not be passed unnoticed. The Hexagon itself faintly images to us a cube, not visible at the first glance, and therefore the fit emblem of that faith in things invisible, most essential to salvation. The first perfect solid, and remind ing you of the cubical stone that sweated blood, and of that deposited by Enoch, it teaches justice, accurac y, and consistency. The infinite divisibil ity of the triangle teaches the infinit y of the Universe, of ti me, of space, and of the Deity, as do the lines that, diverging from the common centre, ever increase their distance from each other as they are infinitel y prolonged. As they may be infinite in number, so are the attributes of Deit y infinite; and as they emanate from one centre and are projected into space, so the whole Universe has em anated from God.

Everywhere in the world there is a natural law, that is, a constant mod e of action, which seems to belong to the nature of things, to the constitution of the Universe. This fact is universal. In different departments we call this mode of action by different names, as the law of Matter, the law of Mind, the law of Morals, and the like. We me an by this, a certain mode of action which belongs to the m aterial, mental, or moral forces, the mode in which commonly they are found to act, and in which it is their ideal to act always. The ideal laws of matter we kno w only from the fact that they are alwa ys obeyed. To us the actual obedience is the onl y evidence of the ideal rule; for in respect to the conduct of the material world, the ideal and the actual are the same. The laws of mat ter we learn only by observation and experienc e. Before experience of the fact, no man could foretell that a body , falling toward the earth, would descend sixteen feet the first second, twice that the next, four ti mes the third, and sixteen times the fourth. No mode of action in our consciousness anticipa tes this rule of action in the outer world. The same is true of all the laws of mat ter. The ideal law is known because it is a fact. The law is imperative. It must be obe yed without hesitation. Laws of cry stallization, laws of proportion in chemical combination, – neither in these nor in an y other law of Nature is there any mar-gin left for oscillat ion of disobedience. Only the primal will of God w orks in the material world, and no secondar y finite will. There are no exceptions to the great general law of Attraction, which binds atom to atom in the body of a rotifier visible only by aid of a m icroscope, orb to orb, sy stem to system; gives unity to the world of things, and rounds these worlds of sys tems to a Universe. At first there seem to be exceptions to this law, as in growth and decomposi tion, in the repulsions of electrici ty; but at length all these are found to be special cases of the one great law of attrac tion acting in various modes. The variety of effect of this law at first surprises the senses; but in the end the unity of cause astonishes the cultiva ted mind. Looked at in reference to this globe, an earthquake is no more than a chink that opens in a garden-walk of a dry day in Sum mer. A sponge is porous, having small spaces between the solid parts: the solar system is only more porous, having larger room between the several orbs: the Universe yet more so, with spaces between the systems, as small, compared with infinite space, as those between the atoms that compose the bulk of the smal lest invisible animalcule, of which mi llions swim in a drop of salt- water. The same attraction holds together the ani malcule, the sponge, the system, and the Universe. Every particle of matter in that Universe is related to each and all the other particl es; and attrac tion is their common bond. Page 597 of 621"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike In the spiritual world, the world of human consciousness, there is also a law, an ideal mode of action for the spiritual forces of m an. The law of Ju stice is as universal an one as the law of At-traction ; though we are very far from being able to reconcil e all the phenomena of Nature with it. The lark has the same right in our view, to live, to sing, to dart at pleasure through the amb ient atmosphere, as the hawk has to pl y his strong wing s in the Sum mer sunshine: and yet the hawk pounces on and devours the harmless lark, as it devours the worm, and as the worm devours the animalcule; and, so far as we know, there is nowhere, in any future state of animal existence, any compensation for this apparent injustice. Among the bees, one rules, while the others obey – some work, while others are idle. With the small ants, the soldiers feed on the proceeds of the workmen's labor. The lion lies in wait for and devours the antelope that has apparentl y as good a right to life as he. Among men, some govern and others serve, capital commands and labor obe ys, and one race, superior in intellec t, avails itself of the strong muscles of another that is inferior; and yet, for all this, no one impea ches the justice of God. No doubt all these varied phenomena are consistent with one great law of justice; and the only difficult y is that we do not, and no doubt we cannot, understand that law. It is very easy for some dreaming and visionar y theorist to say that it is most evidentl y unjust for the lion to devour the deer, and for the eagle to tear and eat the wren; but the trouble is, that we know of no other way, according to the fra me, the constitution, and the organs which God has given them, in which the lion and the eagle could manag e to live at all. Our little measure of justice is not God's measure. His justice does not require us to relieve the hard- working mi llions of all labor, to e mancip ate the serf or slave, unfitted to be free, from all control. No doubt, underneath all the little bubbles, which are the lives, the wishes, the wills, and the plans of the two thousand mil lions or more of human beings on this earth (for bubbles they are, judging b y the space and time they occupy in this great and age- outlasting sea of humank ind), – no doubt, underneath them all resides one and the same eternal force, which they shape into this or the other special form; and over all the same paternal Providence presides, keeping eternal watch over the little and the great, and producing variet y of effect from Unity of Force. It is entirel y true to say that justice is the constitution or fundam ental law of the moral Universe, the law of right, a rule of conduct for man (as it is for every other living creature), in all his moral relations. No doubt all human affairs (like all other affairs), must be subject to that as the law para mount; and what is right agrees therewith and stands, while what is wrong conflicts with it and falls. The difficult y is that we ever erect our notions of what is right and just into the law of justice, and insist that God shall adopt that as His law; instead of striving to learn by observation and reflection what His law is , and then believing that law to be consistent with His infinite justice, whether it corresponds with our limited notion of justice, or does not so correspond. We are too wise in our own conceit, and ever strive to enact our own littl e notions into the Universal Laws of God. It might be difficult for man to prove, even to his own satisfaction, how it is right or just for him to subjugate the horse and ox to his service, giving them in return onl y their daily food, which God has spread out for them on all the green meadows and savannas of the Page 598 of 621"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike world: or how it is just that we should sla y and eat the harmless deer that only crops the green herbage, the buds, and the young leaves, and drinks the free- running water that God made common to all; or the gentle dove, the innocent kid, the man y other living things that so confidentl y trust to our protection; – quite as difficult, perhaps, as to prove it just for one man's intellect or even his wealth to mak e another's strong arms his servants, for daily wages or for a bare subsistence. To find out this universal law of justice is one thing – to under-take to measure off something with our own little tape-line, and call that God's law of ju stice, is another. The great general plan and system, and the great general laws enacted by God, continuall y produce what to our li mited notions is wrong and injustice, which hitherto men have been able to explain to their own satisfaction only by the hypothesis of another existence in which all inequali ties and injustices in this life will be re medied and compensa ted for. To our ideas of justice, it is very unjust that the child is made miserable for life by deformi ty or organic disease, in consequence of the vices of its father; and yet that is part of the universal law. The ancients said that the child was punished for the sins of its father. We say that this its deformi ty or disease is the consequence of its father's vices; but so far as concerns the question of justice or injustice, that is m erely the change of a word. It is very easy to lay down a broad, general principle, embod ying our own idea of what is absolute justice, and to insist that everything shall conform to that: to say, \"all human affairs must be subject to that as the law para mount; what is right agrees therewith and stands, what is wrong conflicts and falls. Private cohesions of self-love, of friendship, or of patriotis m, must all be subordinate to this universal gravitation toward the eternal right.\" The difficult y is that this Universe of necessities God-created, of sequences of cause and effect, and of life evolved from death, this interm inable succession and aggregate of cruelties, will not con-form to any such absolute principle or arbitrar y theory, no mat ter in what sounding words and glitter ing phrases it may be embod ied. Impracticable rules in mor als are always injurious; for as all men fall short of compl iance with them, they turn real virtues into imagin ary offences against a forged law. Ju stice as between man and man and as between man and the animals below him, is that which, under and according to the God-created relations existing between them, and the whole aggregate of circumst ances surrounding the m, is fit and right and proper to be done, with a view to the general as well as to the individual interest. It is not a theoretical principle by which the ver y relations that God has created and imposed on us are to be tried, and approved or condemned. God has made this great system of the Universe, and enacted general laws for its governm ent. Those laws environ ever ything that lives with a m ighty network of necessity . He chose to create the tiger with such organs that he cannot crop the grass, but must eat other flesh or starve. He has made man carnivorous also; and some of the smallest birds are as much so as the tiger. In every step we take, in every breath we draw, is involved the destruction of a multitude of anima te existences, each, no matter how minu te, as much a living creature as ourself. He has made necessar y among mankind a division of labor, intellectual and moral. He has mad e necessar y the varied relations of societ y and dependence, of obedience and control. Page 599 of 621"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike What is thus made necessary cannot be unju st; for if it be, then God the great Lawgiver is Himself unjust. The evil to be avoided is, the legaliza tion of injustice and wrong under the false plea of necessity . Out of all the relations of life grow duties, – as naturall y grow and as undeniabl y, as the leaves grow upon the trees. If we have the right, created by God's law of necessit y, to slay the lamb that we may eat and live, we have no right to torture it in doing so, because that is in no wise necessar y. We have the right to live, if we fairl y can, by the legitim ate exercise of our intellec t, and hire or buy the labor of the strong arms of others, to till our grounds, to dig in our mines, to toil in our manufa ctories; but we have no right to overwork or underpa y them. It is not only true that we may learn the moral law of j ustice, the law of right, by experience and observation; but that God has given us a moral faculty, our conscience, which is able to perceive this law directly and immediately, by intuitiv e perception of it; and it is true that man has in his nature a rule of conduct higher than what he has ever y et come up to, – an ideal of nature that shames his actual of histor y: because man has ever been prone to mak e necessit y, his own necessity , the necessities of societ y, a plea for injustice. But this notion must not be pushed too far – for if we s ubstitute this idealit y for actuality, then it is equall y true that we have within us an ideal rule of right and wrong, to which God Himself in His government of the world has never come, and against which He (we say it reverential ly) every day offends. We detest the tiger and the wolf for the rapacit y and love of blood which are their nature; we revolt against the law by which the crooked limbs and diseased organism of the child are the fruits of the father's vices; we even think that a God Omnipot ent and Omniscient ought to have permitted no pain, no povert y, no servitude; our ideal of justice is more lofty than the actuali ties of God. It is well, as all else is well. He has given us that moral sense for wise and beneficent purposes. We accept it as a significant proof of the inherent loftiness of human nature, that it can entertain an ideal so exalted; and should strive to attain it, as far as we can do so con sistently with the relations which He has created, and the circumstan ces which surround us and hold us captive. If we faithfull y use this facult y of conscience; if, appl ying it to the existing relations and circumstances, we develop it and all its kindred powers, and so deduce the duties that out of these relations and those circu mstances, and limited and qualified by them, arise and become obligator y upon u s, then we learn justice, the law of right, the divine rule of conduct for human life. But if we undertake to define and settle \"the mod e of action that belongs to the infinit ely perfect nature of God,\" and so set up an y ideal rule, be yond all human reach, we soon com e to judge and conde mn His work and the relations which it has pleased Him in His infinite wisdom to create. A sense of j ustice belongs to human nature, and is a part of it. Men find a deep, permanen t, and instinctive delight in justice, not onl y in the outward effects, but in the inward cause, and by their nature love this law of right, this reasonable rule of conduct, this justice, with a deep and abiding love. Justice is the object of the conscience, and fits it as light fits the eye and truth the mind. Justice keeps j ust relations between men. It holds the balance between nation and nation, between a man and his fam ily, tribe, nation, and race, so that his absolute rights and theirs do not interfere, nor their ultimate interests ever clash, nor the eternal interests of the one Page 600 of 621"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike prove antagonistic to those of all or of any other one. This we must believe, if we believe that God is j ust. We must do justice to all, and demand it of all; it is a universal human debt, a universal human claim. But we ma y err greatl y in defining what that justice is. The temporary interests, and what to human view are the rights, of men, do often interfere and clash. The life- interests of the individual often conflict with the perm anent interests and welfare of societ y; and what may seem to be the natural rights of one class or race, with those of another. It is not true to say that \"one man, however little, must not be sacrificed to another, however great, to a majorit y, or to all men.\" That is not only a fallac y, but a most dangerous one. Often one man and man y men must be sacrificed, in the ordinar y sense of the term, to the interest of the m any. It is a comfortab le fallacy to the selfish; for if they cannot, by the law of j ustice, be sacrificed for the com mon good, then their country has no right to dem and of them self -sacrifice; and he is a fool who lays down his life, or sacrifices his estate, or even his luxuries, to insure the safety or prosperit y of his country . According to that doctrine, Curtius was a fool, and Leonidas an idiot; and to die for one's country is no longer beautiful and glorious, but a mere absurdit y. Then it is no longer to be asked that the common soldier shall receive in his bosom the sword or bay onet-thrust which otherwise would let out the life of the great commander on whose fate hang the liberties of his countr y, and the welfare of m illions yet unborn. On the contrary , it is certain that necessit y rules in all the affairs of men, and that the interest and even the life of one man must often be sacrificed to the interest and welfare of his countr y. Some must ever lead the forlorn hope: the missionar y must go among savages, bearing his life in his hand; the physician must expose himself to pestilence for the sake of others; the sailor, in the frail boat upon the wide ocean, escaped from the foundering or burning ship, must step cal mly into the hungry waters, if the lives of the passengers can be saved onl y by the sacrifice of his o wn; the pilot must stand firm at the wheel, and let the flames scorch awa y his own life to insure the com mon safety of those whom the doom ed vessel bears. The mass of men are always looking for what is just. All the vast m achiner y which makes up a State, a world of States, is, on the part of the people, an attempt to organize, not that ideal justice which finds fault with God 's ordinances, but that practica l justice which m ay be attained in the actual organization of the world. The minute and wide-extending civil machinery which makes up the law and the courts, with all their officers and imp lements, on the part of m ankind, is chiefl y an effort to reduce to practice the theory of right. Constitutions are made to establish justice; the decisions of courts are reported to help us judge more wisely in time to come. The nation aims to get together the most nearly just men in the State, that they may incorporate into statutes their aggregate sense of w hat is right. The people wish law to be embodi ed justice, administered without passion. Even in the wildest ages there has been a wild popular justice, but always mixed with passion and administered in hate; for justice takes a rude form with rude men, and beco mes less mix ed with hate and passion in more civilized communities. Every progressive State revises its statutes and revolutioni zes its constitut ion from time to time, seeking to come closer to the utmost possible practica l justice and right; and someti mes, following theorists and Page 601 of 621"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike dreamers in their adoration for the ideal, by erecting into law positive principles of theoreti cal right, works practical injustice, and then has to retrace its steps. In litera ture men always look for practic al justice, and desire that virtue should have its own reward, and vice its appropriate punishment. They are ever on the side of ju stice and humanity; and the majorit y of them have an ideal justice, better than the things about them, juster than the law: for the law is ever imperf ect, not attaining even to the utmost practicable degree of perfection; and no man is as ju st as his own idea of possible and practicab le justice. His passions and his necessities ever cause him to sink below his own ideal. The ideal justice which men ever look up to and strive to rise toward, is true; but it will not be realized in this world. Yet we must approach as near to it as practic able, as we should do toward that ideal democrac y that \"now floats before the eyes of earnest and religious men, – fairer than the Republic of Plato, or More's Utopia, or the Golden Age of fabled memory,\" only taking care that we do not, in striving to reach and ascend to the impossibl e ideal, neglect to seize upon and hold fast to the possible actual. To aim at the best, but be content with the best possible, is the onl y true wisdom. To insist on the absolute right, and throw out of the calculat ion the import ant and all-controlling element of necessit y, is the folly of a mere dreamer. In a world inhabited by men with bodies, and necessaril y with bodily wants and animal passions, the ti me will never come when there will be no want, no oppres sion, nor servitude, no fear of man, no fear of God, but only Love. That can never be while there are inferior intellect, indulgence in low vice, improv idence, indolence, awful visitations of pestilence and war and fam ine, earthquake and volcano, that must of necessit y cause men to want, and serve, and suffer, and fear. But still the ploughshare of justice is ever drawn through and through the field of the world, uprooting the savage plants. Ever we see a continual and progressive triu mph of the right. The injustice of England lost her America, the fairest jewel of her crown. The injustice of Napoleon bore him to the ground more than the snows of Rus sia did, and exiled him to a barren rock, there to pine awa y and die, his life a warning to bid mank ind be just. We intuitive ly understand what justice is, better than we can depict it. What it is in a given case depends so much on circu mstances, that definitions of it are wholly deceitfu l. Often it would be unjust to societ y to do what would, in the absence of that consideration, be pronounced just to the individual. General propositions of man's right to this or that are ever fallacious: and not infrequentl y it would be most unjust to the individual himself to do for him what the theorist, as a general proposition, would say was right and his due. We should ever do unto others what, under the same circumstances, we ought to wish, and should have the right to wish they should do unto us. There are many cases, cases constantl y occur-ring, where one man must take care of himse lf, in preference to another, as where two struggle for the possession of a plank that will save one, but cannot uphold both; or where, assailed, he can save his o wn life only by slaying his adversar y. So one must prefer the safety of his countr y to the lives of her enemies; and somet imes, to insure it, to those of her o wn innocent citizens. The retreating general may cut away a bridge behind him, to dela y pursuit and save the main body of his arm y, though he thereb y Page 602 of 621"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike surrenders a detach ment, a battalion, or even a corps of his own force to certain destruction. These are not departures from justice; though, like other instances where the injury or death of the individual is the safety of the many, where the interest of one individual, class, or race is postponed to that of the public, or of the superior race, they may infringe some dreamer's ideal rule of ju stice. But every departure from real, practical justice is no doubt attended with loss to the unjust man, though the loss is not reported to the public. Injustice, public or private, like every other sin and wrong, is inevitab ly followed by its consequences. The selfish, the grasping, the inhum an, the fraudulentl y unjust, the ungenerous e mployer, and the cruel master, are detested by the great popular heart; while the kind mast er, the liberal employer, the generous, the humane, and the just have the good opinion of all men, and even env y is a tribute to their virtues. Men honor all who stand up for truth and right, and never shrink. The world builds monum ents to its patriots. Four great statesm en, organizers of the right, emb almed in stone, look down upon the lawgivers of France as they pass to their hall of legislation, silent orators to tell how nations love the just. How we revere the marb le lineaments of those ju st judges, Jay and Marshall, that look so calm ly toward the living Bench of the Supreme Court of the United States! What a monument Washington has built in the heart of Americ a and all the world, not because he dreamed of an imprac ticable ideal justice, but by his constant effort to be practica lly just! But necessity alone, and the greatest good of the greatest number, can legitim ately interfere with the domin ion of absolute and ideal justice. Governm ent should not foster the strong at the expense of the weak, nor protect the capitalist and tax the laborer. The powerful should not seek a monopol y of developm ent and enjoyment; not prudence only and the expedient for to-day should be appealed to by statesmen, but conscience and the right: justice should not be forgotten in looking at interest, nor political morality neglected for politica l economy: we should not have national housekeeping instead of national organization on the basis of right. We may well differ as to the abstract right of man y things; for ever y such question has many sides, and few men look at all of them, many only at one. But we all readily recognize cruelty, unfairness, inhuman ity, partialit y, over-reaching, hard-dealing, by their ugly and fami liar lineam ents, and in order to know and to hate and despise them , we do not need to sit as a Court of Errors and Appeals to revise and reverse God's Providences. There are certainl y great evils of civiliza tion at this da y, and man y questions of humani ty long adjourned and put off. The hideous aspect of pauperism, the debasem ent and vice in our cities, tell us by their eloquent silence or in inarticula te mutterings, that the rich and the powerful and the intell ectual do not do their duty by the poor, the feeble, and the ignorant; and every wretched woman who lives, Heaven scarce knows ho w, by making shirts at sixpence each, attests the injustice and inhuman ity of man. There are cruelti es to slaves, and worse cruelties to anim als, each disgraceful to their perpetrators, and equall y unwarranted by the lawful relation of control and dependence which it has pleased God to create. A sentence is written against all that is unjust, written by God in the nature of man and in the nature of the Universe, because it is in the nature of the Infinite God. Fidelit y to your Page 603 of 621"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike faculties, trust in their convictions, that is justice to yourself; a life in obedience thereto, that is justice toward men. No wrong is reall y successful. The gain of injustice is a loss, its pleasure suffering. Iniquit y often seems to prosper, but its success is its defeat and shame. After a long while, the day of reckoning ever comes, to nation as to individual. The knave deceives himself. The miser, starving his brother's body , starves also his own soul, and at death shall creep out of his great estate of injustice, poor and naked and miser able. Whoso escapes a duty avoids a gain. Outward judgment often fails, inward j ustice never. Let a man try to love the wrong and to do the wrong, it is eating stones and not bread, the swift feet of justice are upon him, following with woolen tread, and her iron hands are round his neck. No man can escape from this, any more than from himself. Justice is the angel of God that flies from East to West; and where she stoops her broad wings, it is to bring the counsel of God, and feed mank ind with angel's bread. We cannot understand the moral Universe. The arc is a long one, and our ey es reach but a little way; we cannot calcula te the curve and comple te the figure by the experience of sight; but we can divine it by conscience, and we s urely know that it bends toward ju stice. Justice will not fail, though wickedness appears strong, and has on its side the armies and thrones of power, the riches and the glor y of the world, and though poor men crouch down in despair. Ju stice will not fail and perish out from the world of men, nor will what is reall y wrong and contrar y to God' s real law of ju stice continuall y endure. The Power, the Wisdom, and the Justice of God are on the side of ever y just thought, and it cannot fail, any more than God Himself can perish. In human affairs, the justice of God must work by human means. Men are the instrumen ts of God' s principles; our morali ty is the instrumen t of His j ustice, which, inco mprehensibl e to us, seems to our short vision often to work in justice, but will at some time still the oppressor 's brutal laugh. Justice is the rule of conduct written in the nature of mankind. We may, in our dail y life, in house or field or shop, in the office or in the court, help to prepare the way for the com monwealth of justice which is slowly, but, we w ould fain hope, surely approaching. All the justice we mature will bless us here and hereafter, and at our death we shall leave it added to the common store of humank ind. And every Mason who, content to do that which is possible and practicabl e, does and enforces justice, may help deepen the channel of human morality in which God 's justice runs; and so the wrecks of evil that now check and obstruct the strea m may the sooner be swept out and borne awa y by the resistless tide of Omnipo tent Right.

[Master of R oyal Secret.] THE Occult Science of the Ancient Magi was concealed under the shadow s of the Ancient Mysteries: it was imperf ectly revealed or rather disfigured by the Gnostics: it is guessed at under the obscurities that cover the pretended crimes of the Te mplars; and it is found enveloped in enigmas that seem impenetrable, in the Rites of the Highest Masonry. Magism was the Science of Abraham and Orpheus, of Confucius and Zoroaster. It was the dogmas of this Science that were engraven on the tables of stone b y Hanoch and Trismegistus. Moses purified and re- veiled them, for that is the meaning of the word reveal . He covered them with a new veil, when he m ade of the Holy Kabalah the exclusive heritage of the people of Israel, and the inviolab le Secret of its priests. The M ysteries of Thebes and Eleusis preserved among the nations some symbols of it, al-read y altered, and the mysterious key whereof was lost among the instrumen ts of an ever- growing superstition. Jerusalem, the murderess of her prophets, and so often prostituted to the false gods of the Syrians and Baby lonians, had at length in its turn lost the Holy Word, when a Page 605 of 621"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike Prophet announced to the Magi by the consecrated Star of Initiation, came to rend asunder the worn veil of the old Temple, in order to give the Church a new tissue of legends and symbols, that still and ever conceals from the Profane, and ever preserves to the Elect the same truths. It was the remembrance of this scientific and religious Absolute, of this doctrine that is summed up in a word, of this Word, in fine, alternatel y lost and found again, that was transmitted to the Elect of all the Ancient Initiations: it was this same remembrance, preserved, or perhaps profaned in the celebrat ed Order of the Templars, that became for all the secret associations, of the Rose-Croix, of the Illuminati, and of the Hermet ic Freemasons, the reason of their strange rites, of their signs more or less conventiona l, and, above all, of their mutual devotedness and of their power. The Gnostics caused the Gnosis to be proscribed by the Christians, and the official Sanctuar y was closed against the high initiat ion. Thus the Hierarch y of Knowledge was compro mitted by the violences of usurping ignorance, and the disorders of the Sanctuary are reproduced in the State; for alway s, willingl y or unwillingl y, the King is su stained by the Priest, and it is from the eternal Sanctuar y of the Divine instruction that the Powers of the Earth, to insure the mselves durabili ty, must receive their consecration and their force. The Hermet ic Science of the early Christian ages, cultivated also by Geber, Alfarabius, and others of the Arabs, studied b y the Chiefs of the Templars, and embod ied in certain symbols of the higher Degrees of Freemasonr y, may be accuratel y defined as the Kabalah in active realiza tion, or the Magic of Works. It has three analogous Degrees, religious, philosophical, and ph ysical realizat ion. Its religious realiza tion is the durable foundation of the true Empire and the true Priesthood that rule in the realm of human intellect: its philosophical realiza tion is the establishm ent of an absolute Doctrine, known in all times as the \"HOLY Doctrine,\" and of which PLUTARCH, in the Treatise \" de Iside et Osiride ,\" speaks at large but mysteriously; and of a Hierarchical instruction to secure the uninterrupted succession of Adepts among the Initiates: its physical realiza tion is the discover y and applicat ion, in the Microcosm, or Little World, of the creativ e law that incessantl y peoples the great Universe. Measure a corner of the Creation, and mul tiply that space in proportional progres sion, and the entire Infinite will multiply its circles filled with universes, w hich will pass in proportional segments between the ideal and elongating branches of your Compass. Now suppose that from any point whatever of the Infinite above y ou a hand holds another Compass or a Square, the lines of the Celestia l triangle will necessaril y meet those of the Compass of Science, to form the Mysterious Star of Solomon. All hypotheses scientifica lly probable are the last gleams of the twilight of knowledge, or its last shadow s. Faith begins where Reason sink s exhausted. Beyond the human Reason is the Divine Reason, to our feebleness the great Absurdity, the Infinite Absurd, which confounds us and which we believe. For the Master, the Compass of Faith is above the Square of Reason; but both rest upon the Holy Scriptures and co mbine to form the Blazing Star of Truth.

Our brain is a book printed within and without, and the two writings are, with all men, more or less confused. The primar y tradition of the single revelation has been preserved under the name of the \"Kabalah,\" by the Priesthood of Israel. The Kabalistic doctrine, which was also the dogma of the Magi and of Hermes, is contained in the Sepher Yetsairah, the Sohar, and the Talmud. According to that doctrine, the Absolute is the Being, in which The Word Is, the Word that is the utterance and expression of being and life. Magic is that which it is; it is by itself, like the mathematics; for it is the exact and absolute science of Nature and its laws. Magic is the science of the Ancient Magi: and the Christian religion, which has imposed silence on the lying oracles, and put an end to the prestiges of the false Gods, itself reveres those Magi who came from the East, guided by a Star, to adore the Saviour of the world in His cradle. Tradition also gives these Magi the title of \" Kings ;\" because initia tion into Magism constitutes a genuine royalty; and because the grand art of the Magi is sty led by all the Adepts, \" The Royal Art ,\" or the Holy Realm or Empire, Sanctum Regnum . The Star which guided them is that same Blazing Star, the i mage whereof we find in all initiations. To the Alchem ists it is the sign of the Quintessence; to the Magists, the Grand Arcanum ; to the Kabalists, the Sacred Pentagram. The stud y of this Pentagram could not but lead the Magi to the knowledge of the New Name which was about to raise itself above all names, and cause all creatures capable of adoration to bend the knee. Magic unites in one and the same science, whatsoever Philosoph y can posses s that is most certain, and Religion of the Infallible and the Eternal. It perfectl y and incontestabl y reconciles these two ter ms that at first blush s eem so oppo sed to each other; faith and reason, science and creed, authorit y and libert y. It supplies the hum an mind with an instrum ent of philosophical and religious certaint y, exact as the mathematics, and accounting for the infall ibility of the mathematics themselves. Thus there is an Absolute, in the matters of the Intellig ence and of Faith. The Supreme Reason has not left the glea ms of the human understanding to vacill ate at hazard. There is an incontestable verity, there is an infallible method of knowing this verit y, and by the knowledge of it, those who accept it as a rule ma y give their will a sovereign power that will make them the mast ers of all inferior things and of all errant spirits; that is to say , will make them the Arbiters and Kings of the World. Science has its nights and its dawns, because it gives the intell ectual world a life which has its regulated movements and its progres sive phases. It is with Truths, as with the luminous rays: nothing of what is conceal ed is lost; but also, nothing of what is discovered is absolutel y new. God has been pleased to give to Science, which is the reflect ion of His Glory, the Seal of His Eternit y.

The Priests of Eg ypt knew, better than we do, the laws of movem ent and of life. They knew ho w to temper or intensif y action by re-action; and readil y foresaw the realization of these effects, the causes of which they had determ ined. The Columns of Seth, Enoch, Solomon, and Hercules have symbolized in the Magian traditions this universal law of the Equilibriu m; and the Science of the Equilibrium or balancing of Forces had led the Initiates to that of the universal gravitat ion around the centres of Life, Heat, and Light. Thales and Pythagoras learned in the Sanctuaries of Egy pt that the Earth revolved around the Sun; but the y did not attempt to make this generall y known, because to do so it would have been necessar y to reveal one of the great Secrets of the Temple, that double law of attraction and radiation or of sympathy and antipath y, of fixedness and movem ent, which is the principle of Creation, and the perpetual cause of life. This Truth was ridiculed by the Christian Lactant ius, as it was long after sought to be proven a falsehood by persecution, by Papal Rome. So the philosophers reasoned, while the Priests, without replying to them or even smiling at their errors, w rote, in those Hierogly phics that created all dogmas and all poetry, the Secrets of the Truth. When Truth co mes into the world, the Star of Kno wledge advises the Magi of it, and the y hasten to adore the Infant who creates the Future. It is by means of the Intelligenc e of the Hierarch y and the practice of obedience, that one obtains Initiation. If the Rulers have the Divine Right to govern, the true Initiat e will cheerfull y obey. The orthodox traditions were carried from Chaldea by Abraham. They reigned in Egypt in the time of Joseph, together with the knowledge of the True God. Mo ses carried Orthodoxy out of Egy pt, and in the Secret Traditions of the Kabalah we find a Theolog y entire, perfect, unique, like that which in Christianit y is most grand and best explained by the Fathers and the Doctors, the whole with a consistenc y and a harmoniousness which it is not as yet given to the world to compreh end. The Sohar, which is the Ke y of the Holy Books, opens also all the depths and lights, all the obscurities of the Ancient Mythologies and of the Sciences originall y conceal ed in the Sanctuaries. It is true that the Secret of this Key must be kno wn, to enable one to m ake use of it, and that for even the most penetrat ing intellects, not initiated in this Secret, the Sohar is absolutel y incomprehensibl e and almost illegible. The Secret of the Occult Sciences is that of Nature itself, the Secret of the generation of the Angels and Worlds, that of the Omnipot ence of God. \" Ye shall be like the Elohim, knowing good and evil ,\" had the Serpent of Genesis s aid, and the Tree of Knowledge became the Tree of Death. For six thousand y ears the Martyrs of Kno wledge toil and die at the foot of this tree, that it may again become the Tree of Life.

To organize Anarchy, is the proble m which the revolutionists have and will eternall y have to resolve. It is the rock of Sis yphus that will alwa ys fall back upon them.

We escape from the harmonious monarchy of Reason, onl y to fall under the irregular dictatorship of Folly . Sometimes superstitious enthusiasms, sometimes the miserable calculat ions of the materialist instinct have led astray the nations, and God at last urges the world on toward believing Reason and reasonable Beliefs. We have had prophets enough without philosophy , and philosophers without religion; the blind believers and the skeptics resemb le each other, and are as far the one as the other from the eternal salvation. In the chaos of universal doubt and of the conflicts of Reason and Faith, the great men and Seers have been but infirm and morbid artists, seeking the beau- ideal at the risk and peril of their reason and life.

Comparing finite knowledge with the Infinite, the Philosophers know little more than the apes! In all that \"void\" space are the Infinite Forces of God, acting in an infinite variety of directions, back and forth, and never for an instant inactive. In all of it, active through the whole of its Infinity, is the Light that is the Visible Manifestation of God. The earth and ever y other planet and sphere that is not a Centre of Light, carries its cone of shado w with it as it flies and flashes round in its orbit; but the darkness has no home in the Universe. To illuminate the sphere on one side, is to project a cone of darkness on the other; and Error also is the Shadow of the Truth with which God illuminates the Soul. In all that \"Void,\" also, is the Mysterious and ever Active Electr icity, and Heat, and the Omnipresen t Ether. At the will of God the Invisible beco mes Visible. Two invisible gases, combined by the action of a Force of God, and compressed, becom e and rem ain the water that fills the great basins of the seas, flow s in the rivers and rivulets, leaps forth from the rocks or springs, drops upon the earth in rains, or whitens it with snows, and bridges the Danubes with ice, or gathers in vast reservoirs in the earth's bosom. God man ifested fills all the extension that we foolishl y call Empty Space and the Void. And every where in the Universe, what we call Life and Movemen t results from a continual conflict of Forces or Impulses. Whenever that active antagonis m ceases, the immobility and inertia, which are Death, result. If, says the Kabalah, the Justice of God, which is Severit y or the Female, alone reigned, creation of imperfe ct beings such as man would from the beginning have been impossible, because Sin being congenital with Humanity, the Infinite Justice, measuring the Sin b y the Infinity of the God offended against, must have annihilated Humanity at the instant of its creation ; and not only Humanit y but the Angels, since these also, like all created by God and less than perfect, are sinful. Nothing imp erfect would have been pos sible. If, on the other hand, the Mercy or Benignit y of God, the Male, were in no wise counteract ed, Sin would go unpunished, and the Universe fall into a chaos of corruption. Let God but repeal a single principle or law of chem ical attraction or sympathy, and the antagonisti c forces equilibra ted in matter, released from constraint, would instantaneousl y expand all that we term matter into impalp able and invisible gases, such as water or stea m is, when, confined in a cylinder and sub jected to an immense degree of that mysterious force of the Deit y which we call \"heat,\" it is by its expansion released. Incessantl y the great currents and rivers of air flow and rush and roll from the equator to the frozen polar regions, and back from these to the torrid equatoria l realms. Necessaril y incident to these great, i mmense, equilibrated and beneficent movem ents, caused b y the antagonis m of equatoria l heat and polar cold, are the typhoons, tornadoes, and c yclones that result from conflicts between the rushing currents. These and the benign trade-winds result from the same great law. God is omnipo tent; but effects without causes are impossibl e, and these effects cannot but someti mes be evil. The fire would not warm, if it could not also burn, the human flesh. The most virulent poisons are the most sovereign remedies, when given in due proportion.

The arch rests not on a single column, but springs from one on either side. So is it also with the Divine Ju stice and Mercy , and with the Human Reason and Human Faith. That purely scholastic Theolog y, issue of the Categories of Aristotle and of the Sentences of Peter Lombard, that logic of the s yllogism which argues instead of reasoning, and finds a response to every thing by subtilizing on terms, wholly ignored the Kabalistic dogma and wandered off into the drear vacuit y of darknes s. It was less a philosophy or a wisdom than a philosophical automaton, replying by means of springs, and uncoiling its theses like a wheeled movement. It was not the human verb but the monotonous cry of a mach ine, the inanimate speech of an Android. It was the fatal precision of mechanis m, instead of a free application of rational necessities. ST. THO MAS A QUINAS crushed with a single blow all this scaffolding of words built one upon the other, b y proclai ming the eternal Empire of Reason, in that magnifi cent sentence, \" A thing is not just because GOD wills it; but GOD wills it because it is just .\" The proxima te consequence of this proposition, arguing from the greater to the less, was this: \" A thing is not true because ARISTOTLE has said it; but ARISTOTLE could not reasonably say it unless it was true. Seek then, first of all, the TRUTH and JUSTICE, and the Science of ARISTOTLE will be given you in addition .\" It is the fine dream of the greatest of the Poets, that Hell, beco me useless, is to be closed at length, by the aggrandizem ent of Heaven; that the proble m of Evil is to receive its final solution, and Good alone, necessary and triu mphant, is to reign in Eternit y. So the Persian dogma taught that AHRIMAN and his subordinate ministers of Evil were at last, by means of a Redeemer and Mediator, to be reconciled with Deity, and all Evil to end. But unfortunatel y, the philosopher forgets all the laws of equilibrium , and seeks to absorb the Light in a splendor without shadow, and movem ent in an absolute repose that would be the cessation of life. So long as there shall be a visible light, there will be a shadow proportional to this Light, and whatever is illuminated will cast its cone of shadow. Repose will never be happiness, if it is not balanced by an analogous and contrary movement. This is the immutable law of Nature, the Eternal Will of the JUSTICE which is GOD. The same reason necessitates Evil and Sorro w in Humanity, which renders indispensable the bitterness of the waters of the seas. Here also, Harmon y can result only from the analogy of contraries, and what is above exists b y reason of what is below. It is the depth that determines the height; and if the valleys are filled up, the mounta ins disappear: so, if the shadows are effaced, the Light is annulled, which is only visible by the graduated contrast of gloom and splendor, and universal obscurit y will be produced b y an immense dazzling. Even the colors in the Light only exist by the presence of the shadow: it is the threefold alliance of the day and night, the luminous image of the dogma, the Light made Shadow, as the Saviour is the Logos mad e man: and all this reposes on the same law, the primary law of creation, the single and absolute law of Nature, that of the distinction and harmon ious ponderation of the contrary forces in the universal equipoise. The two great columns of the Temple that symbolizes the Universe are Necessit y, or the omnipo tent Will of God, w hich nothing can disobe y, and Liberty, or the free-will of His creatures. Apparentl y and to our human reason antagonisti c, the same Reason is not Page 611 of 621"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike incapable of compreh ending how the y can be in equipoise. The Infinite Power and Wisdom could so plan the Universe and the Infinite Succession of things as to leave man free to act, and, foreseeing what each would at every instant think and do, to mak e of the free-will and free-action of each an instru ment to aid in effecting its general purpose. For even a man, foreseeing that another will do a certain act, and in nowise controlling or even influencing him may use that action as an instrum ent to effect his own purpo ses. The Infinite Wisdom of God foresees what each will do, and uses it as an instrumen t, by the exertion of His Infinite Power, which yet does not control the Human action so as to annihila te its freedom. The result is Harmon y, the third colu mn that up-holds the Lodge. The same Harmon y results from the equipoise of Neces sity and Libert y. The will of God is not for an instant defeated nor thwarted, and this is the Divine Victory ; and yet He does not tempt nor con strain men to do Evil, and thus Hi s Infinite Glory is unimpaired. The result is Stability, Cohesion, and Perm anence in the Universe, and undivided Dominion and Autocrac y in the Deity. And these, Victory , Glory, Stabilit y, and Dominion, are the last four Sephiroth of the Kabalah. I Am, God said to Moses, that which Is, Was and Shall forever Be. But the Ver y God, in His unmanif ested Essence, conceived of as not y et having created and as Alone, has no Name. Such wa s the doctrine of all the ancient Sages, and it is so expres sly declared in the Kabalah. יהוה is the Name of t he Deity manifested in a single act, that of Creation, and containing within Himse lf, in idea and actual ity, the whole Universe, to be invested with form and be ma terially developed during the eternal succession of ages. As G od never WAS N OT, so He never THOUGHT not, and the Universe has no more had a beginning than the Divine Thought of which it is the utterance, – no more than the Deity Himself. The duration of the Universe is but a point halfway upon the infinite line of eternit y; and God was not inert and uncreative during the eternity that stretches behind that point. The Archetype of the Universe did never not exist in the Divine Mind. The Word wa s in the BEGINNI NG with God, and WAS God. A nd the Ineffable NAME is that, not of the Very Essence but of the Absolute, manifested as Being or Existence. For Existence or Being, said the Philosophers, is li mitation; and the Very Deity is not limited nor defined, but is all that may possibly be , besides all that is, was, and shall be. Reversing the letters of the Ineffable Name, and dividing it, it beco mes bi-sexual, as the word יה , Yud-He or JAH is, and discloses the meaning of much of the obscure language of the Kabalah, and is The Highest of which the Columns Jachin and Boaz are the symbol. \"In the image of Deit y,\" we are told, \"God created the Man; Male and Fema le created He them :\" and the writer, symbolizing the Divine by the Human, then tells us that the woman, at first contained in the man, was taken from his side. So Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom, was born, a woman and in armor, of the brain of Jove; Isis wa s the sister before she was the wife of Osiris, and within BRAHM, the Source of all, the Very God, without sex or name, was developed MAYA, the Mother of all that is. The WORD is the First and Only - begotten of the Father; and the awe with which the Highest M ysteries were regarded has imposed silence in respect to the Nature of the Holy Spirit. The Word is Light, and the Life of Humani ty. It is for the Adepts to understand the meaning of the S ymbols.

You see upon the altar of those Degrees the SQUARE and the COMPASS, and y ou remember how they lay upon the altar in each Degree. The SQUARE is an instrum ent adapted for plane surfaces onl y, and therefore appropriate to Geometr y, or measurem ent of the Earth, which appears to be, and was by the Ancients supposed to be, a plane. The CO MPASS is an instrument that has relation to spheres and spherical surfaces, and is adapted to spherical trigono metry, or that branch of ma thematics which deals with the Heavens and the orbits of the planetar y bodies. The SQUARE, therefore, is a natural and appropriate Symbol of this Earth and the things that belong to it, are of it, or concern it. The Compass is an equall y natural and appropriate Symbol of the Heavens, and of all celestial things and celestia l natures. You see at the beginning of this reading, an old Hermet ic Symbol, copied from the \"MATERIA PRI MA\" of Valentinus, printed at Franckfurt, in 1613, with a treatise entitled \"AZOTH.\" Upon it y ou see a Triangle upon a Square, both of these contained in a circle; and above this, standing upon a dragon, a human body, with two arms only, but two heads, one male and the other fema le. By the side of the male head is the Sun, and b y that of the female head, the Moon, the crescent within the circle of the full moon. And the hand on the male side holds a Compas s , and that on the female side, a Squa re . The Heavens and the Earth were personified as Deities, even among the Ary an Ancestors of the European nations of the Hindus, Zends, Bactrians, and Persians; and the Rig Veda Sanhita contains hymns addressed to the m as gods. The y were deified also among the Phœnicians; and among the Greeks OU RANOS and GEA, Heaven and Earth, were sung a s the most ancient of the Deities, by Hesiod. It is the great, fertile, beautiful MOTHER, Earth, that produces, with li mitless profusion of beneficenc e, everything that ministers to the needs, to the comfor t, and to the luxur y of man. From her tee ming and inexhaustible bosom come the fruits, the grain, the flowers, in their season. From it comes all that feeds the animals which serve m an as laborers and for food. She, in the fair Springtim e, is green with abundant grass, and the trees spring from her soil, and from her teeming vitality take their wealth of green leaves. In her womb are found the useful and valuable minera ls; hers are the seas the swarm with life; hers the rivers that furnish food and irrigation, and the mount ains that send down the streams which swell into these rivers; hers the forests that feed the sacred fires for the sacrifices, and blaze upon the domesti c hearths. The EARTH, therefore, the great PRODUCER, was always represented as a female , as the MOTHER, – Great, Bounteous, Beneficent Mother Earth. On the other hand, it is the light and heat of the Sun in the Heavens, and the rains that seem to come from them, that in the Springtime make fruitful this bountifull y-producing Earth, that restore life and warmth to her veins, chilled by Winter, set running free her strea ms, and beget , as it were, that greenness and that abundance of which she is so prolific. As the procreative and generative agents, the Heavens and the Sun have alwa ys been regarded as male ; as the generators that fructify the Earth and cause it to produce.

The COMPASS, therefore, as the Symbol of the Heavens , represents the spiritual, intellectual, and moral portion of this double nature of Humanit y; and the SQUARE, as the Symbol of the Earth , its ma terial, sensual, and baser portion. \"Truth and Intellig ence,\" said one of the Ancient Indian Sects of Philosophers, \"are the Eternal attributes of God, not of the individual Soul, which is susceptible both of knowledge and ignorance, of pleasure and pain; therefore God and the individual Soul are distinct:\" and this expression of the ancient Nyaya Philosophers, in regard to Truth, has been handed down to us through the long succession of ages, in the lessons of Freemasonry, wherein we read, that \"Truth is a Divine Attribute, and the foundation of every virtue.\" \"While embodied in matter,\" they said, \"the Soul is in a state of i mprisonm ent, and is under the influence of evil passions; but having, by intense study, arrived at the knowledge of the elements and principles of Nature, it attains unto the place of TIE ETERNAL; in which state of happiness, its individualit y does not cease.\" The vitality which animates the mortal frame, the Breath of Life of the Hebrew Genesis, the Hindu Philosophers in general held, perishes with it; but the Soul is divine, an emanation of the Spirit of God, but not a portion of that Spirit. For they compared it to the heat and light sent forth from the Sun, or to a ray of that light, which neither lessens nor divides its own es sence. However created, or invested with separate existence, the Soul, which is but the creature of the Deity, cannot know the mode of its creation, nor comprehend its own individuali ty. It cannot even comprehend how the being which it and the bod y constitute, can feel pain, or see, or hear. It has pleased the Universal Creator to set bounds to the scope of our human and finite reason, bey ond which it cannot reach; and if we are capable of compr ehending the mode and manner of the creation or generation of the Universe of things, He has been pleased to conceal it from us by an impene trable veil, while the words used to express the act have no other definite meaning than that He caused that Universe to com mence to exist.

In every human being the Divine and the Human are intermingled. In every one there are the Reason and the Moral sense, the passions that prompt to evil, and the sensual appetites. \"If ye live after the flesh, y e shall die,\" said Paul, writing to the Christians at Rome, \"but if ye through the spirit do mort ify the deeds of the bod y, ye shall live. For as man y as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\" \"The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,\" he said, writing to the Christians of Galatia, \"and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.\" \"That which I do, I do not willingl y do,\" he wrote to the Romans, \"for what I wish to do, that I do not do, but that which I hate I do. It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. To will, is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For, I do not do the good that I desire to do; and the evil that I do not wish to do, that I do do. I find then a law , that when I desire to do good, evil is present with me; for I delight in the law of God after the inward man, but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivi ty to the law of sin which is in m y members... So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\" Life is a battle, and to fight that battle heroicall y and well is the great purpose of every man's existence, who is worthy and fit to live at all. To stem the strong currents of adversit y, to advance in despite of all obstacles, to snatch victory from the jealous grasp of fortune, to beco me a chief and a leader among men, to rise to rank and power by eloquence, courage, perseverance, study, energy , activity, discouraged by no reverses, impatient of no dela ys, deterred by no hazards; to win wealth, to subjugate men by our intellect, the ver y elemen ts by our audacit y, to succeed, to prosper, to thrive; – thus it is, according to the general understanding, that one fights well the battle of life. Even to succeed in business by that boldness w hich halts for no risk s, that audacit y which stakes all upon hazardous chances; by the shrewdnes s of the close dealer, the boldness of the unscrupulous operator, even by the knaveries of the stock- board and the gold-room; to crawl up into place by disreputable means or the votes of brutal ignorance, – these also are deemed to be among the great successes of life. But that which is the greatest battle, and in which the truest honor and most real success are to be won, is that which our intell ect and reason and mora l sense, our spiritual natures, fight against our sen sual appetites and evil passions, our earthl y and material or anima l nature. Therein only are the true glories of heroism to be won, there only the successes that entitle us to triu mphs.

You have heard more than one definition of freem asonry. The truest and the most significant you have yet to hear. It is taught to the entered Apprentice, the Fellow-Craft, and the Master, and it is taught in ever y Degree through which you have advanced to this. It is a definition of what Freemasonr y is, of what its purposes and its very essence and spirit are; and it has for every one of us the force and sanctit y of a divine law, and imposes on ever y one of us a solemn obligation. It is sy mbolized and taught, to the Apprentice as well as to you, by the COMPASS and the SQUARE; upon w hich, as well as upon the Book of yo ur Religion and the Book of the law of the Scottish Freemasonr y, you have taken so man y obligations. As a Knight, you have been taught it by the Swords, the symbols of HONOR and DUTY, on which y ou have taken your vows: it was taught you by the BALANCE, the symbol of all Equilibriu m, and by the CROSS, the symbol of devotedness and self-sacrifice; but all that these teach and contain is taught and contained, for Entered Apprentice, Knight, and Prince alike, by the Compass and the Square. For the Apprentice, the points of the Compass are beneath the Square. For the Fellow- Craft, one is above and one beneath. For the Master, both are dominant, and have rule, control, and empire over the s ymbol of the earthl y and the ma terial. FREEMAS ONRY is the subjugation of the Human that is in man by the Divine; the Conquest of the Appeti tes and Passions by the Moral Sense and the Reason; a continual effort, struggle, and warfare of the Spiritual against the Material and Sensual . That victory, when it has been achieved and secured, and the conqueror may rest upon his shield and wear the well- earned laurels, is the true HOLY EMPIRE. To achieve it, the Mason must first attain a solid conviction, founded upon reason, that he hath within him a spiritual nature, a soul that is not to die when the bod y is dissolved, but is to continue to exist and to advance toward perfection through all the ages of eternit y, and to see more and more clearly, as it draws nearer unto God, the Light of the Divine Presence. This the Philosoph y of the Ancient and Accepted Rite teaches him; and it encourages him to persevere by helping him to believe that his free will is entirel y consistent with God' s Omnipo tence and Omniscien ce; that He is not only infinite in power, and of infinite wisdom, but of infinit e mercy, and an infinite ly tender pity and love for the frail and imperfec t creatures that He has made. Every Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, from the first to the thirty- second, teaches by its ceremon ial as well as b y its instruction, that the noblest purpose of life and the highest duty of a man are to strive incessantl y and vigorously to win the mastery of ever ything, of that which in him is spiritual and divine, over that which is material and sensual; so that in him also, as in the Universe which God governs, Harmon y and Beauty may be the result of a just equilibriu m. Page 616 of 621"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike You have been taught this in those Degrees, conferred in the Lodge of Perfection, which inculcate particul arly the practical morality of Freemasonr y. To be true, under whatever temptation to be false; to be honest in all your dealings, even if great losses should be the consequence; to be charitabl e, when selfishness would prompt you to close y our hand, and deprivation of luxury or comfor t must follow the charitab le act; to judge ju stly and impartially, even in your own case, when baser impulses prompt you to do an injustice in order that you may be benefited or justified; to be tolerant, when passion prompts to intoleran ce and persecution; to do that which is right, when the wrong seems to promise larger profit; and to wrong no man of anything that is his, ho wever easy it may seem so to enrich yourself; – in all these things and others which you promised in those Degrees, yo ur spiritual nature is taught and encouraged to assert its rightful dominion over your appetites and passions. The philosophical Degrees have taught you the value of knowledge, the excell ence of truth, the superiorit y of intel lectual labor, the dignity and value of your soul, the worth of great and noble thoughts; and thus endeavored to assist y ou to rise above the level of the animal appetites and passions, the pursuits of greed and the miserab le struggles of ambition, and to find purer pleasure and nobler prizes and rewards in the acquisition of knowledge, the enlarge ment of the intellect, the interpreta tion of the sacred writing of God upon the great pages of the Book of Nature. And the Chivalric Degrees have led you on the same path, by showing you the excellen ce of generosit y, clemency, forgiveness of injuries, magnan imity, contempt of danger, and the paramount obligat ions of Duty and Honor. They have taught you to over-com e the fear of death, to devote yourself to the great cause of civil and religious Liberty, to be the Soldier of all that is just, right, and true; in the midst of pestilence to deserve y our title of Knight Commander of the Temple, and neither there nor Elsewhere to desert y our post and flee dastard- like from the foe. In all this, you assert the superiorit y and right to domin ion of that in you which is spiritual and divine. No base fear of danger or death, no sordid ambi tions or pitiful greeds or base considerations can tempt a true Scottish Knight to dishonor, and so make his intelle ct, his reason, his s oul, the bond-slave of his appetites, of his passions, of that which is m aterial and anima l, selfish and brutish in his nature. It is not pos sible to create a true and genuine Brotherhood upon an y theory of the baseness of human nature: nor by a community of belief in abstract propositions as to the nature of the Deity, the number of His persons, or other theore ms of religious faith: nor by the establish ment of a system of association simply for mutu al relief, and by which, in consideration of certain payments regularl y made, each becomes entitled to a certain stipend in case of sicknes s, to attention then, and to the cere monies of burial after death. There can be no genuine Brotherhood without mutual regard, good opinion and esteem, mutual charity, and mutua l allowance for faults and failings. It is those only who learn habitual ly to think better of each other, to look habitual ly for the good that is in each other, and expect, allow for, and overlook, the evil, who can be Brethren one of the other, in any true sense of the word. Those who gloat over the failings of one another, who think each other to be naturall y base and low, of a nature in which the Evil predomina tes and excellen ce is not to be looked for, cannot be even friends, and much less Brethren. Page 617 of 621"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike No one can have a right to think meanly of his race, unless he also thinks meanly of himself. If, from a single fault or error, he judges of the character of another, and takes the single act as evidence of the whole nature of the man and of the whole course of his life, he ought to consent to be judged by the same rule, and to admi t it to be right that others should thus uncharitab ly condemn himself. But such ju dgments will become impossible when he incessantl y reminds himself that in ever y man who lives there is an immortal Soul endeavoring to do that which is right and just; a Ray, however smal l, and almost inappreciab le, from the Great Source of Light and Intell igence, which ever struggles upward am id all the impedi ments of sense and the obstructions of the passions; and that in every man this ray continuall y wages war against his evil passions and his unrul y appetit es, or, if it has succumbed, is never wholl y extinguished and annihila ted. For he will then see that it is not victor y, but the struggle that de-serves honor; since in this as in all else no man can alwa ys command success. Amid a cloud of errors, of failure, and short-comings, he will look for the struggling Soul, for that which is good in ever y one am id the evil, and, believing that each is better than from his acts and omissions he seems to be, and that God cares for him still, and pities him and loves him, he will feel that even the erring sinner is still his brother, still entitled to his s ympathy, and bound to him by the indissoluble ties of fellowship. If there be nothing of the divine in man, what is he, after all, but a more intellig ent animal? He hath no fault nor vice which some beast hath not; and therefore in his vices he is but a beast of a higher order; and he hath hardl y any moral excellenc e, perhaps none, which some animal hath not in as great a degree, – even the more excellent of these, such as generosit y, fidelity, and magnan imity. Bardesan, the Syrian Christian, in his Book of the Laws of Countries, says, of men, that \"in the things belonging to their bodies, they maintain their nature like animals, and in the things which belong to their minds, they do that which they wish, as being free and with power, and as the likeness of God\"; and Meliton, Bishop of Sardis, in his Oration to Antoninus Cæsar, sa ys, \"Let Him, the ever-living God, be alwa ys present in thy mind; for thy mind itself is His likeness, for it, too, is invisible and impa lpable, and without form... As He exists forever, so thou also, when thou shalt have put off this which is visible and corruptible, shalt stand before Him forever, living and endowed with knowledge.\" As a mat ter far above our compreh ension, and in the Hebrew Genesis the words that are used to express the origin of things are of uncertain meaning, and with equal propriet y may be translated by the word \"generated,\" \"produced,\" \"made,\" or \"created,\" we need not dispute nor debate whether the Soul or Spirit of man be a ray that has eman ated or flowed forth from the Supreme Intelligen ce, or whether the Infinite Power hath called each into existence from nothing, by a mere exertion of Its will, and endowed it with im mortality, and with intellig ence like unto the Divine Intelligen ce: for, in either case it may be said that in man the Divine is united to the Human. Of this union the equilat eral Triangle inscribed within the Square is a Sy mbol. We see the Soul, Plato said, as men see the statue of Glaucus, recovered from the sea wherein it had lain many years – which viewing, it was not easy, if possible, to discern what was its original nature, its limbs having been partly broken and partl y worn and by Page 618 of 621"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike defacement changed, by the action of the waves, and shells, weeds, and pebbles adhering to it, so that it more resembl ed some strange monster than that which it was when it left its Divine Source. Even so, he said, we see the Soul, deformed by innumerable things that have done it harm, have mutilated and defaced it. But the Mason who hath the ROY AL SECRET can also with him argue, from beholding its love of wisdom, its tendenc y toward association with what is divine and im mortal, its larger aspirations, its struggles, though they may have ended in defeat, with the impediments and enthralm ents of the senses and the passions, that when it shall have been rescued from the material environm ents that now prove too strong for it, and be freed from the defor ming and disfiguring accretions that here adhere to it, it will again be seen in its true nature, and by degrees ascend b y the mystic ladder of the Spheres, to its first home and place of origin. The ROYAL SECRET, of which y ou are Prince, if you are a true Adept, if knowledge seems to you advisable, and Philosophy is, for y ou, radiant with a divine beauty, is that which the Sohar ter ms The Mystery of the BALANCE. It is the Secret of the UNI VERSAL EQUILIBRIUM: – – Of that Equilibriu m in the Deity, between the Infinite Divine WISDOM and the Infinite Divine POWER, from which result the Stabilit y of the Universe, the unchangeableness of the Divine Law, and the Principles of Truth, Justice, and Right which are a part of it; and the Supreme Obligation of the Divine Law upon all men, as superior to all other law, and forming a part of all the laws of men and nations. – Of that Equilibriu m also, between the Infinite Divine JU STICE and the Infinite Divine MERCY, the result of which is the Infinite Divine EQUITY, and the Moral Harmony or Beauty of the Universe. By it the endurance of created and imperfe ct natures in the presence of a Perfect Deity is made possible; and for Him, also, as for u s, to love is better than to hate, and Forgiveness is wiser than Revenge or Punishmen t. – Of that Equilibriu m between NECES SITY and LIBERTY, between the action of the DIVINE Omnipotenc e and the Free-will of man, by which vices and base actions, and ungenerous thoughts and word s are crimes and wrong s, justly punished b y the law of cause and consequence, though nothing in the Universe can happen or be done contrar y to the will of God; and without which co-existence of Libert y and Necessit y, of Free-will in the creature and Omnipoten ce in the Creator, there could be no religion, nor any law of right and wrong, or mer it and demeri t, nor any justice in human punishments or penal laws. – Of that Equilibriu m between Good and Evil, and Light and Darkness in the world, which assures us that all is the work of the Infinite Wisdom and of an Infinite Love; and that there is no rebellious demon of Evil, or Principle of Darkness co-existent and in eternal controversy with God, or the Principle of Light and of Good: b y attaining to the knowledge of which equilibriu m we can, through Faith, see that the existence of Evil, Sin, Suffering, and Sorro w in the world, is consistent with the Infinite Goodnes s as well as with the Infinite Wisdom of the Almigh ty. Sympathy and Antipath y, Attraction and Repulsion, each a Force of nature, are contraries, in the souls of men and in the Universe of spheres and worlds; and from the action and opposition of each against the other, result Harmon y, and that movem ent which is the Life Page 619 of 621"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike of the Universe and the Soul alike. They are not antagonists of each other. The force that repels a Planet from the Sun is no more an evil force, than that which attracts the Planet toward the central Luminar y; for each is created and exerted by the Deit y, and the result is the harmonious movement of the obedient Planets in their elliptic orbits, and the mathematical accurac y and unvar ying regularit y of their movements. – Of that Equilibriu m between Authority and Individual Action which constitutes Free Governmen t, by settling on immutable foundations Libert y with Obedience to Law, Equality with Sub jection to Authority, and Fraternity with Subordination to the Wisest and the Best: and of that Equilibrium between the Active Energy of the Will of the Present, expressed b y the Vote of the People, and the Passive Stabilit y and Permanen ce of the Will of the Past, expressed in constitutions of government, written or unwritten, and in the laws and customs, gray with age and sanctified by time, as precedents and authorit y; which is represented by the arch resting on the two columns, Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the portals of the Te mple builded by Wisdom, on one of which Masonry sets the celestia l Globe, symbol of the spiritual part of our composi te nature, and on the other the terrestria l Globe, symbol of the m aterial part. – And, finall y, of that Equilibriu m, possible in ourselves, and which Masonry incessantl y labors to accomp lish in its Initiates, and demands of its Adepts and Princes (else unworth y of their titles), between the Spiritual and Divine and the Material and Human in man; between the Intellect, Reason, and Moral Sense on one side, and the Appetites and Passions on the other, from which result the Harmony and Beaut y of a well- regulated life. Which possible Equilibr ium proves to us that our Appetites and Senses also are Forces given unto us by God, for purpo ses of good, and not the fruits of the ma lignanc y of a Devil, to be detested, mortifi ed, and, if possible, rendered inert and dead: that they are given us to be the means by which we shall be strengthened and incited to great and good deeds, and are to be wisely used, and not abused; to be controlled and kept within due bounds by the Reason and the Moral Sense; to be made useful instruments and servants, and not permi tted to becom e the managers and masters, using our intell ect and reason as base instru ments for their gratific ation. And this Equilibriu m teaches us, above all, to reverence ourselves as im mortal souls, and to have respect and charit y for others, who are even such as we are, partakers with us of the Divine Nature, lighted by a ray of the Divine Intellig ence, struggling, like us, toward the light; capable, like us, of progre ss upward toward perfection, and deserving to be loved and pitied, but never to be hated nor despised; to be aided and encouraged in this life-struggle, and not to be abandoned nor left to wander in the darknes s alone, still less to be trampled upon in our own efforts to ascend. From the mutual action and re-action of each of these pairs of oppo sites and contraries results that which with them forms the Triangle, to all the Ancient Sages the expressive symbol of the Deit y; as from Osiris and Isis, Har-oeri, the Master of Light and Life, and the Creative Word. At the angles of one stand, s ymbolically, the three colu mns that support the Lodge, itself a symbol of the Universe, Wisdom, Power, and Harmon y or Beaut y. One of these symbols, found on the Tracing- Board of the Apprentice's Degree, teaches this last lesson of Freem asonry. It is the right-angled Triangle, representing man, as a union of the Page 620 of 621"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"Morals and Dogma – by Albert Pike spiritual and mater ial, of the divine and human. The base, measured by the number 3, the number of the Triangle, represents the Deity and the Divine; the perpendicular, measured by the number 4, the number of the Square, represents the Earth, the Material, and the Human; and the hypothenuse, measured by 5, represents that nature which is produced by the union of the Divine and Human, the Soul and the Bod y; the squares, 9 and 16, of the base and perpendicular, added together, producing 25, the square root whereof is 5, the measure of the hypothenuse. And as in each Triangle of Perfection, one is three and three are one, so man is one, though of a double nature; and he attains the purposes of his being only when the two natures that are in him are in just equilibriu m; and his life is a success onl y when it too is a harmon y, and beautiful, like the great Harmoni es of God and the Universe. Such, m y Brother, is the TRUE WORD of a Master Mason; such the true RO YAL SECRET, which mak es possible, and shall at length make real, the HOLY EMPIRE of true Masonic Brotherhood.
