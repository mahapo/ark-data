Not so. This Miracle Mineral supplement works in a few hours. The #1 killer of mankind in the world today is malaria, a disease that is usually overcome by th is supplement in on ly four hours in most cases. This has been proven th rough clinical tria ls in Malawi, a country in eastern Africa. In kill ing the malaria parasite in the body, there was not a single failure. More than 75,000 malaria victims have taken the Miracle Mineral Supplemen t and are now back to work and living productive lives. After taking the Miracle Mineral Supplement AIDS patients are often disease free in three days and ot her diseases and conditions simply disappear. If patients in the nearest hospital were treated with this Miracle supplement, over 50% of them would be back home within a week. For more than 100 years clinics a nd hospitals have used the active ingredients in this supplement to sterilize hospital floors, tables, equipment, and other items. Now this same powerful germ-killer can be harnessed by the immune system to safely kill pathogens in the human body. Amazing as it might seem, when used correctly, the immune system can use this killer to only a ttack those germs, bacteria and viruses that are harmful to the body, and does not affect the friendly bacteria in the body nor any of the healthy cells. In this book I have, to the best of my ability, stuck to the facts of exactly what has happened regarding the Miracle Mineral Supplement. This book is the story of the discove ry and further development of the most amazing enhancement for the imm une system yet discovered. Thus it is the greatest solution to mankind ’ s diseases and ills now known; it is not a drug. I believe if you follow my ef forts to develop this data and to make it available to the public, the st ory will help make it real to you and convince you to give it a try. To th at purpose I have provided complete details on how to make the supplement in your kitchen, or to buy most of the ingredients off the shelf. It is entirely possible that you will save someone ’ s life or your own."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Because the Miracle Mineral Supplemen t functions as a supercharger to the immune system, it is not mean t for treatment of any particular disease; rather it is meant to improve the immune system to the point of overcoming many diseases, frequently in less than 24 hours. My purpose for writing this book is th at this information is far too important to allow any one person, one group or even several groups to have control. It is information that the world should have. After 5 years of seeing practically nothing done by a group that could have done a great deal, I finally realized that the information simply had to be distributed to as many people as po ssible or someone would always be out of the loop of receiving this life sa ving data. It regularly occurs that there is a great deal of important me dical information withheld from the public that could save lives. It is my intention to prevent that from happening with this information.  "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Foreword This foreword is written by Dr. Hector Francisco Romero G., a medical doctor in the state of Sonora, Mexico where he has a very successful clinic that treats cancer and many other illnesses considered incurable. He uses the MMS talked about in this book and a number of other non intrusive treatments. He is well kn own in Sonora for the work that he has done with Mexican Indians. Dr . Romero makes me look much greater than I am, but then how could I refuse his foreword. Dr. Romero writes: A dear good old friend of mine and respectful philosopher teacher impeller of man of good temper in this desert state of Sonora Mexico used to say: “Those men who live “the University of Life,” would leave footpr ints in this world.” Not just anyone builds up and writes with his own ideas “a book”. This is the same case with my friend Jim Humble. This personality is a challenger, a world walker, an anxiou s person, who has fought all his life to leave footprints with his contributions of investigation to man humanity. He has covered thousands and thousands of kilometers as his investigation has shown in this book, suffering infectious illness of Malaria; an illness which put his life at risk, demonstrating to medical science that it is possible to count with new alternatives treatments. It will give a better quality of life to those sick ones from endemics zones, as Jim says, in latitudes like in th e region of Africa, Asia, and South America. In these places there is a lot of mortality due to malaria and other virus infections such as the HI V, causing the death statistics to be very considerable and is higher comp ared to other places in the world. His product was investigated and well recognized by the health authorities in an African country. W ith the MMS, he offers them better hopes and quality of life. Especially, those who have the threats of these man destructive illnesses. Our experi ence in Mexico with the MMS, in the state of Sonora has b een to treat some illne sses that are contagious febrile infections, inflammatory de generative tumors, prostate cancer, and some other malignant tumors, with good and hopefully results. For all of these, I pray to god so he can have a great intelligence so he continues helping those towns of the world that have no hope and are forgotten, specially the children that deserve our attention for a life, and a better future."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Copyright notice The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century - Part I and II Author Jim V.

It was a long narrow house and there was furniture to get around and a hallway to get through, but in spite of the obstacle course I made it. Bill Denicolo, an old friend, in Chicago was calling. We talked and he asked, “Jim, are you any good at prospecting for gold?” I was never too modest, so I told him the truth (my truth). “Yes,” I said, “I am amongst the best, if not the be st”. That was enough for him. He was a friend, and being already fam iliar with my work in mining, he believed me. He continued, “I’m work ing with a group that wants to do gold mining in the jungle in South Am erica. We need your help and we are paying the going rate, plus you get a share of the profits”. That was it. I agreed to leave in approximately one month. They were willing to use my gold recovery tec hnology. This would require that I ship equipment ahead. It took the entire month to get things ready and to ready myself for the jungle. The mo st important thing that I took, that relates to this story, was several bottles of Stabilized Oxygen (Please don’t get the idea that Stabilized Oxyge n is the miracle solution that I am writing about in this book). All water in the jungle is dangerous to drink. In North America, water from fast-moving streams is usually quite safe to drink, but in the jungle it doesn’t matter how fast the stream is moving, it is not safe to drink. In fact, one can almost always guarantee that one or more dangerous diseases are present. Despite that knowledge, I did end up drinking from a fast-moving stream while in the jungle, and I did de velop typhoid fever. A number of people had mentioned to me that the oxygen in Stabilized Oxygen would purify water by killing the pathogens pres ent, especially if the water was left setting overnight. I had once sent a single test off to a laboratory after treating some sewe rage water with Stabilized Oxygen and the results had come back s howing all pathogens dead. I was relatively confident that I could purify my drinking water in the jungle. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I had actually worked with Stabilized Oxygen for some time. A friend of mine that lived a little way outside of Las Vegas used it quite a bit with his animals. He gave it to his chickens in their water to keep them healthy and he used it with his dogs. He even injected it into his dog’s veins once when it was sick and hi s dog was cured in several hours. I often dropped by his home to see how things were going. Bill Denicolo sent a contract to my house in Las Vegas, Nevada, where I had retired from gold mining. The cont ract was quite generous. I was to be paid a reasonable salary, and I would have 20% ownership in the operation, provided I located gold in the jungle. I signed a copy of the contract and sent it off, and received an airplane ticket in return. I was 64 years old but in top condition an d I would have no trouble navigating in the jungle. The country was Guyana. The name had been changed a few years earlier from British Guyana to simply Guyana. Guyana is the country just south of Venezuela on the eas t coast of South America. You probably remember it from the story of Jim Jones and his cult. The entire cult committed suicide at one point or actually a few committed suicides after killing the children and many of the other adults with cyanide. Only a few survived. I arrived in Guyana on a normal day while it was raining, about midyear of 1996. I was met by several local pe ople who would be part of the mining operation and they led me through the lines at the airport with no waiting. We drove about 30 miles to Georgetown, Guyana’s largest city which is also the Capitol. I was taken to a local house where I was to stay until we departed for the in terior, where we would prospect Guyana’s greatest rain forest and jungle. At the house I met Mike, a local who owned the claims to a very large portion of the jungle and would also be one of the partners. Joel Kane, who lives in the eastern part of the U.S., was also one of the partners listed on the contract I signed. He was to arrive within two weeks before we departed for the jungle. There was one other partner, who was also supposed to arrive soon, but probably after we departed for the jungle. His name was Beta and he was rela ted to a high official in the government. The high official’s na me was Moses Nagamotoo, and he"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 12 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century was the First Minister directly under the Prime Minister. (Beta’s real name was Satkumar Hemraj, but he preferred the na me of Beta.) Beta was not present, but because he was our partner I was invited to the First Minister’s (Moses Nagamotoo) house for dinner the second evening that I was there. While at his house the First Minister complained of his back problem that was almost prev enting him from doing his job in the government. I explained to him that I sometimes adjusted people’s necks and I might be able to help hi s back. So after dinner he allowed me to adjust his neck, which I did very delicately, making sure that I did not jerk or hurt him. Within minutes hi s back problem began to subside. We were all amazed and soon he was walking quite easily around the house. The next day one of the servants ca lled me and asked if I would adjust Mose’s daughter’s neck, as she was having bad back problems as well. I agreed over the phone, so they picked me up for dinner that night which was the third evening I was there and after dinner I adjusted her neck. Her name was Angela. He had another daughter named Adila, but she did not have a problem. Angela, as amazing as it may sound, was soon walking easily and her back problem seemed to disappear. I did not always have such spectacular results, but sometimes it did happen. I was very glad that I had taken the time to learn to adjust necks. Making such a powerful friend as Moses Nagamotoo was important. I did not realize how important it was at the time, bu t no doubt it kept me from spending time in prison at a later date. For the record and future researchers, Sam Hinds was the Prime Minister. Jim Punwasee was the Minist er of Mines whom we often went to see and occasionally visited in his home. The government had a gold laborator y where they bought gold from local miners. The problem was that a ll gold that came in was completely covered with mercury. They put th e gold under a hood and used a blow torch to burn off the mercury befo re weighing the gold. Well, as everyone knows, mercury fumes are extremely poisonous. Those fumes were going up the exhaust stack and out into the government courtyard and into the government complex area. Many people had complained of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 13 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century this practice and when they gave me a tour of their gol d facilities this was mentioned. I offered to design a simple fume scrubber and they took me up on my offer. They had very little money for such refinements, so I designed the scrubber from two 55 gallon barrels. It just so happened that I had severa l thousand ping pong balls stored in a warehouse in Las Vegas. I had them shi pped to Guyana to be used in the scrubber. By the time the balls arri ved, I was in the jungle, but they simply poured the ping pong balls into the barrel designed to use them, turned on the water spray, and it was wo rking when I returned. It did the job. As luck had it, with the mercury scrubber, and helping the first Minister and his daughter, I hit it off very well with a few officials in the government there. I had a friend that wanted to move from Russia to Guyana and I mentioned this to the Minister of mining and a couple of days later I got a call from the Mini ster of Immigration saying that I could call my friend and tell him to visit the Guyana Consulate in Moscow. He said there were papers waiting for my friend there that would allow him to immigrate to Guya na. So you can see, I really did have a little bit of pull. I mention this merely to illustrate my good luck. In our first expedition into the jung le we would be taking eight men who would carry the supplies and set up camp as we reached various locations. Our workers were called droggers. These men were hired by Mike and they arrived at the house about a week ahead of time to begin putting supplies and equipment togeth er. One of the droggers was the foreman and the others, of course, were workers. Finally the time for our expedition a rrived and neither Joel nor Beta had arrived, but we couldn’t wait. Th e men only made $6.00 a day (U.S. money), but that still cost to keep them around and we wanted to get things done. So the final crew consis ted of me, Mike the landholder, and the eight droggers. The trip into the interi or took about two days. First there was about an hour’s ride from Georgetown to the town of Parika on the Mazaruni Cuyuni River. We loaded our supplies onto a large truck and four taxies. We arrived at Parika at about 9:00 a.m. and loaded our supplies onto several large speed boats. The river at this point is more than five miles"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 14 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century wide. Should you decide to do your own research on this part of the story, you will find that the next leg of the journey took us about four hours at what can be called high speed on that river. We finally arrived at our next destin ation, the town of Bartica, which is considered the gateway to the interior of the country of Guyana. There we bought mostly food supplies. Th ere are a number of food stores constructed like warehouses which mo stly supply excursions into the interior. Our buyer bought mostly b eans and rice. Normally, they buy only rice for such trips, but because I was there, they added several sacks of beans. On other trips I was able to get them to buy more variety of groceries. We then loaded all supplies into several boats and crossed the river to a port on the other side about one m ile away where we transferred our supplies and equipment into two very large trucks. The trucks had wheels that were more than six feet in diameter for driving through the roads consisting mainly of mud there in the jungle. Even those big wheels could not go where there were no roads. The supplies were tied down securely and most of the men th en elected to walk on a somewhat shorter route to the next jump-off po int into the jungle. I soon learned why they preferred to walk. The road was so rough and the trucks bounced so badly that it took constant attention to just hold on. There was no sleeping during the five hours that the trucks took to arrive at the final jump-off point on the last river leg of our journey. We arrived after dark as it always gets dark at 6:00 p.m. and gets light at 6:00 a.m. in the jungle near the equa tor. We slept wherever we could that night. I slept on a bench outside of the small store there. The next morning we again loaded all of our supplies in boats and continued up what was now the Cuyuni branch of the river. Boats in this river are usually loaded to the gills, as the saying goes. The sides of these boats were less than four inch es above the water. It wouldn’t require a very large wave to come over the side one time and the boat, loaded as it was, would sink to the bottom. However, it just happens that there are almost never any large waves in these rivers . No storms ever happen in the jungle. It rains terribly hard, but very little wind accompanies the rain and so storms simply do not occur. In fact, there are no natural disasters in this area of the world, i.e. th ere are no storms, no hurricanes, no forest fires, or earth quakes."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 15 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century We traveled upriver for about four hours and arrived where the real last jump-off point actually was. After we unloaded the boats and they pulled away, the men began loading themselves with supplies. The droggers carried their loads against their backs, but the weight was on their heads. A strap we nt around the top of thei r heads and down to the pack against their back. They claime d that this was the least tiring of any method of carrying loads. Th ey carried loads of up to 80 pounds through the jungle and mountains. It was now about 10:30 a.m. We would have to travel up over a jungle mountain to the other side. Well we called it a mountain, but hills are not considered mountains in that area until they are 1,000 feet high. This hill was 997 feet high, and by the time we had climbed to the top, we were certain it was a mountain. The mountain was totally covered with jungle. In this area, where the humidity is 100%, and sometimes ev en 110%, it does not matter if it rains or not. One is very soon so aking wet as the perspiration cannot evaporate. All clothes are soake d. Those who bring leather boots will have boots full of water, because either the rain or the sweat will soon fill them. Keeping an eye on what the locals wear, I wore only tennis shoes. Boots offer some protection from snakes, but they become almost impossible to use after a short time because they are soon filled with perspiration. I decided to just be extra careful in watching for snakes. Some of the men had to make severa l trips over the mountain in order to get all of our supplies to the other side . It took almost two complete days of travel to arrive at our campsite. This gives you an idea of how far out in the jungle we were. Several days later when two of our men came down with malaria, we were plenty worried. We had been assured that there was no malaria in this area of the jungle and we had not thought to bring malaria medicine along with us. I immediately sent two men running to the closest mining camp hopi ng that they might have malaria drugs. That would take at least two days, and if they had no malaria medicine it would be at least six days before the men returned. We simply had to accept those facts because it was the best we could do. We might have tried calling a helic opter, but we didn’t have a radio. Radios don’t work in the jungle anywa y, except for very short distances. Considering all of the data that I had learned about Stabilized Oxygen, it seemed to me, knowing it killed pathoge ns in water, that it might cure malaria. I sat down with the men who had malaria and asked them if"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 16 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century they would be interested in trying this “health drink” from America. They were very sick and suffering. They lay in their hammocks shivering from the chills, and at the same time with high fever. Their symptoms included headaches, achi ng muscles and joints, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. They were willing to try anything and they did so. I gave them both a healthy dose of the stabilized oxygen in some water and they drank it straight down. I thought, that’s all I can do for now; we’ll just have to wait for the runners to return. In one hour the shivering had stopped. That didn’t mean much as the shivering comes and goes, but they looked a little better. Four hours later they were setting up kidding about how bad they had been f eeling. They got up out of their bunks and sat down at the table to eat dinner that evening. The next morning two more men had come dow n with malaria. They took the same doses of Stabilized Oxygen a nd they were feeling okay by noon. We all were amazed. (This is not th e whole story, and Stabilized Oxygen does not work all the time.) I continued with the gold prospect ing. I had developed a method of assaying for gold (that means to dete rmine the amount of gold that is present) that was quite simple. I was able to conduct assays myself instead of having to send my assays off to a lab somewhere and wait a couple of weeks for the answer. Soon I had located some gold deposits and we began planning to put up a gold mill in the jungle. This is not a story about gold, so to make a long story short, while putting up a gold mill and doing further gold prospecting, I did quite a bit of traveling in the jungle. Wherever I went, I treated people for malaria (and sometimes typhoid fever). Although the Stabilized Oxygen worked only about 70% of the time, it was enough to make me quite famous in the jungle. On the way back to town during that fi rst trip into the jungle, we reached a mining operation that was shut down for vacation. There were a number of men who were merely waiting for the mill to start up again. One of the men was sitting at a tabl e looking very sick. I asked him what was wrong and he said that he was waiting for a boat to pick him up. He said he had typhoid fever and malaria at the same time. I mentioned my Stabilized Oxygen which I merely called a health drink and he said he would try it. On my return from town he came running out to meet me. He grabbed my hand and pumped it up and down. He"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 17 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century told me that he had gotten better wi thin hours after I left and he didn’t have to go into town after all. I left him with a small bottle of drops, as I had done in other places in the jungle. There were a number of good stories like that one, but unfortunately at that time there were a lot of people it did not help. Still, it was a treatment that got much better results than the malaria medicines used there. People in malaria areas cannot afford to take the malaria preventive medicines as side effects always develop after a time. Visitors can usually only afford to take malaria medicines for a short period. Thus, the locals never take the malaria preventative medicines. They have to depend upon being cured by the standard malaria medicines after they contract mala ria, and unfortunately malaria has developed a resistance to those medicines. Visitors can only afford to take malaria medicines for a short peri od. As it turned out, several of my associates were hospitalized as a result of the malaria preventive medicines. I visited a missionary clinic near one of the mining villages in the jungle. They had, as I remember, four beds. I offered the “health drink” to them, but they said to me that malaria was a disease visited upon the people of the jungle because of thei r sinful sex practices and that they did not believe that God wanted them to have a cure for malaria. There was nothing I could do to cha nge their minds. I felt terrible to see those people suffering, but I had to leave. I won’t mention the religion involved as I feel that they must have changed their mind about helping malaria victims by this time. Back in Georgetown I telephoned a friend, Bob Tate, about the Stabilized Oxygen curing malaria. He immediately flew to Guyana. We discussed it and decided to see if we could sell the Stabilized Oxygen in Guyana. We put an ad in the local paper stating that our solution cured malaria. That was a mistake. I mmediately the local television station sent reporters over to our place and we were on TV telling about our solution. Then the radio and newspa per reporters arri ved. We were famous for about three days. Th en the government dropped a bomb on us. The minister of health called us in for an interview. She told us that if we sold our solution to one more person, that we would be in their prison and that we wouldn’t like thei r prison. I had seen the prison and I knew that she was right."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 18 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I talked to my friend, the First Mini ster, Moses Nagamotoo, one evening. He explained to me that two drug co mpanies had called the Minister of Health and threatened to quit shippi ng drugs to the local hospital if she didn’t do something about the person clai ming to be able to cure malaria. He explained that there was nothing his government could do at this time to help me, but he mentioned that he suggested to the Minister of Health that she give me some latitude. At that point I made an even bigge r mistake. Although we removed our ad from the newspaper, I continued to sell the solution to more people who needed it. My partner, Bob Ta te, had already gone home, but I was still planning to do gold mining in th e jungle. We were just about ready with our mining supplies when I got word that they were going to charge me with a crime and that it would be better if I were gone or were somewhere else. I found th at people in Georgetown are more afraid of the jungle than are people from Las Ve gas. They seldom chase people in the jungle. I immediately made the trip up the river and the supplies followed me a few days later. This is the basic story of the discovery that Stabilized Oxygen sometimes cures malaria; however that is only th e beginning of my story. I did not consider it a Miracle supplement, yet. I stayed upriver for slightly over six months working on the gold recovery mill. That part of the operation I financed myself because Joel Kane was very slow in arriving and never provided additional money. When he finally arrived, after he saw some of the gold that my mill was recovering, he wanted complete ownership, and offered me 3% instead of the 20 % in the contract. When I did not agree, he had Mike the owner of the land and the droggers that Mike had hired tear down my working mill and carry it off into the jungle. I know that’s what he did, because he told me so. According to the contract, if he did not use my technology he did not need to give me 20%. The problem for him was that the new technology that Mike, the landowner, implemented didn’t work. Thus not only did I lose my investment but he lost his as well. He was a millionaire and really didn’t care, but it was a little tougher on me. When I came back to town after those six months, all the Health Ministry problems had blown over and I left for the USA. I lost my investment money, but I had the knowledge of wh at the Stabilized Oxygen could do"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Discovery  Chapter 1  Page 19 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century and it was very exciting. I no longer cared about the gold. I couldn’t wait to get home to begin a tes ting program to find out why the Stabilized Oxygen only worked part of the time. I went back to Guyana a couple months later when another company hired me to help them improve their recovery of gold. I was still working with the Stabilized O xygen. One night, I was careless and allowed myself to be bitten hundreds of times by mosquitoes. It really wasn’t planned, but when the mosquito es started biting, I just let them bite. Several days later I began to develop malaria. The very first symptom is just that you have light i ndigestion at a meal. It’s not very pronounced, only a slight feeling of nausea that passes in about 15 minutes. You don’t feel the real naus ea until the next day. Since I did get sick, I decided that I might as well check out my own medicine. So I decided to wait until I got a blood te st at the hospital in Georgetown before starting any treatment. That wa s almost a fatal mistake. The bus that runs from that part of the j ungle to Georgetown did not come and I know that almost always people who wait too long for treatment end up dead. I waited a couple of days for the bus, but it didn’t arrive and I was getting very sick. Still, I wanted to be absolutely certain, with a blood test, that I had malaria. I was goi ng home soon and I would not have any chance to do further testing of this kind in the US. I didn’t tell anyone I wa s performing a test on myself. My employers, seeing how sick I was, felt responsible for getting me back to town. So when I agreed to pay for part of the cost for an airplane to pick me up, they agreed instantly. In that part of the jungle they do have a radio and a nearby landing strip. The plane finally came the next day (now my fourth day of being sick). I rode a bicycle to the landing strip. By this time I was very sick. When I arrived at Georgetown, they put me in a taxi and took me straight to the hospital. At the hospital I waited several hours for a blood test. I was definitely showing the malaria symptoms. The doc tor told me that my blood tested positive for malaria. I was an outpatient, so he just gave me a small bottle of malaria pills. Of course, I did not take the pills; instead I took a large dose of my own medicine. With in hours I was feeling better. It worked for me. To top it off, I went back to the hospital and had another blood test taken that now showed nega tive for malaria. I was elated! I was the first patient to have a blood te st both before and after taking the Stabilized Oxygen.

I was riding my Honda motorcycle that I bought when I first arrived in Guyana around the city. As I rode along the street I met an old friend from Canada who was there to do some diamond mining. I stopped and we shook hands and sat down at a sidewa lk café to talk. As we were talking, he noticed a friend shuffling along the street. He called out and the friend came over. We were introduced and he was invited to sit down. He looked very tired and just a little sick. I asked him what was wrong and he said malaria. He said that the drugs that the hospital was giving him didn’t seem to be helpi ng much. I said, “Well, you just happened to come to the right place.” I explained what I had just found out about curing malaria and said, “If you will wait just severa l minutes I will ride home and get you some solution to take”. He agreed to wait. When I returned, I mixed a drink and gave it to him in a glass furnished by the sidewalk café. We continued to talk. Afte r about half an hour he said, “You know , I feel a little bit better, it must be my imagina tion”. All in all, we sat there about two hours after he took the solution. In that small amount of time all of his symptoms were gone. I gave hi m a small bottle of the solution, and later that night he came to where I was staying and got another bottle from me. My plans at that time were to complete the research and then turn the information over to the world. I was sure I could get it out to the world one way or another.

The plan was to set up and manufacture my own special mining equipment in order to make a living while also investigating the Stabilized Oxygen that I had used in the jungle. Unfortunately, during my exchange of Guyana money for American money before departing Guyana, a large sum of money was stolen from me as I had no experience with the money system there. Therefore, ou r funds for investing in the mining equipment manufacturing business were very limited. I sold my 40 foot ocean going houseboat for a small sum, which helped a lot. We worked our mining equipment busi ness for about a year but then Bob began to develop the terrible illne ss known as Lou Gehrig’s disease and was unable to do much work. The sales of the equipment began to falter for many reasons. The magazine in which we advertised made a big mistake with our advertising and then refused to give us credit for the mistake, which cost us thousands. Eventually I ended up living on my Social Security income. However, at times I did get to do an assay or two, which helped. With my son’s help furnishing me with a computer and using the Internet, I began writing to various pe n pals in Africa. Finally, I made friends with a man in Tanzania w ho took people on safaris to Mount Kilimanjaro. His name was Moses A ugustino. I realized that he was mainly interested in making friends with people in America because he hoped to come upon some kind of an opportunity. Had I been in his shoes I might have done the same thing. He soon asked me for $40. I realized that to him $40 was a lot of money, and actually at that time, $40 was quite a bit to me as well. But since I wanted him to try the Stabilized Oxygen on some malaria cas es in Tanzania, I sent him the $40.

According to my instructions, he began giving my solution to malaria victims that he knew in his area. Soon people were getting well fast, but again not ever yone. He had a doctor friend, whom he told about the Stabilized Oxyge n. At that time we called it the “Humble Health Drink”. I sent his doctor friend two bottles and I received an email back from the docto r saying that he couldn’t see how salty water would help a malaria case. I emailed him back and said, “Just try it and you will see.” Well, the fact is, he did try it and he was amazed. He began to treat all of his malaria patients with the solution. The problem was there wasn’t much mala ria in this particular area. If there had been as much there as ther e was in the South of Tanzania, he would have treated hundreds of pe ople, and it might have been a different story, but he only got a few cases of malaria each week.

Moses was the first man to cure someone in Africa of malaria using the MMS. They treated many people after these letters were written and I did get more data concerning the Stabili zed Oxygen (Humble Health Drink). Meanwhile, I was working to find out what chemical the Stabilized Oxygen really was and how it was ma de. I needed to find out why it wasn’t 100% effective. I learned th at Dr. William F. Koch first started working with this solution in Germany back in 1926. He used it in conjunction with mentally retarded ch ildren, because he believed that the Stabilized Oxygen produced nontoxi c oxygen identical to the oxygen produced by breathing. Dr. Koch used his formula for the next 10 years believing that this formula somehow increased oxygen to the brain of the retarded children. Unfortunately, th at was not the case. The problem was that either the chemistry was not modern enough for Dr. Koch to understand exactly what the formula was doing, or he just didn’t understand chemistry well enough. The formula found its way to the U.S. around 1930. Over the years those who could finally dig out the actual formula began to add it into various products thinking that it was a form of oxygen that the body could make use of. Researchers concerning Stab ilized Oxygen since that time have continued to make the same mistake. The fact is that what is now called and has been called Stabilized Oxygen for the past 80 years contains no oxygen that the body can use. In order to be useful to the body, oxygen must be oxygen in its el emental state. That means no charge. In other"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 26 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century words, oxygen cannot be an ion form of oxygen. The oxygen that is in Stabilized Oxygen is oxyge n in an ionic form with a minus two charge. Saying that the body can use the oxygen in Stabilized Oxygen is like saying that the body can use the oxygen in carbon dioxide. Do you see? Carbon dioxide has two ions of oxygen w ith the same minus two charges. If you breathe only carbon di oxide you will die. The oxygen in Stabilized Oxygen merely becomes part of the water in the body. Water is made up of oxygen and hydrogen. In that condition, oxygen and hydrogen do not destroy any pathogens at all. I wa s later amazed to find that several universities had also made this same mi stake. Of course, at that point I did not know any better either. I ju st knew the solution needed to be improved. When you take a breath of air you are taking millions of oxygen atoms into your lungs. When you br eathe out, guess what? You are breathing oxygen out in the form of carbon di oxide. The amount of oxygen going out is the same as the amount that came in. But going out it is carbon dioxide. You see, the dioxide is oxygen, but it is spent oxygen (so to speak). The thing that the oxygen does that keeps the body alive is it oxidizes things in the body. Oxida tion consists of the oxygen atom accepting electrons which destroys poisons and neutralizes chemicals and releases heat energy. In th e process carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide or some other combination is created. When the oxygen accepts the electrons, it is no longe r an oxygen atom but it becomes an oxygen ion with a minus two charge. If it already has a minus two charge, as it does in Stabilized Oxygen, it cannot oxidize anything and thus it is of no value to the body as oxygen . So if it isn’t oxygen that comes from the so called Stabilized Oxygen, that kills the malaria parasite, what is it? You know, finding the formula for Stabilized Oxygen was a hard th ing to do back in 1998 if you had a limited knowledge of chemistry. Everyone who had the formula wasn’t telling and even when they sold it, they would not put the ingredients on the label. I did find one company that gave instructions for using Stabilized Oxygen. They said that after you put the drops into a glass of water it became unstable and thus you should never wait more than one hour before drinking the mi xture. I thought that was interesting. So I put 10 drops into a glass of water, waited for about eight hours and then smelled it, like chemists often do. I thought I smelled chlorine. I"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 27 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century realized that if water did make th e Stabilized Oxygen unstable, it was because the water had made it less al kaline (more neutral). I had been using 10 drops, but by that time I was getting the idea that I would have to use more drops. After adding 20 drops of Stabilized Oxygen to a glass of water, I decided to add a li ttle vinegar because it is a food that contains an acid called acetic acid which I knew would make it less alkaline than even water would. I waited for more than 24 hours this time and then I could detect a much stronger smell of chlorine. By that time, my friends in Africa trusted me to some small extent, so they were willing to give it a try. They started using the improved formula of 20 drops of the Stabilized Oxyge n in a full glass of water with one teaspoon of vinegar. After waiti ng 24 hours they then gave it to several of those who were not helped with the original first dose. It worked in every case when they used the vinegar and waited 24 hours. To test my mixture, I bought some chlorine m easuring sticks used for swimming pools, and guess what? Af ter a few hours, the mixture began to measure a slight amount of chlorine and after 24 hours it measured at least 1 ppm (part per million) of chlorine. That really wasn’t the total answer, but I was getting closer. I didn’ t realize it at first, but the sticks were measuring chlorine dioxide . Next, I put a lid on the glass containing the mixture and found that it developed the same strength of chlorine in two hours as it did in 24 hours without the lid. That is, of course, so long as I also used the vinegar. The reason was that the chlorine was not going off into the air nearly as fast. I transmitted this data to Tanzania and they began to use this new procedure. They added the teaspoon of vinegar, used a lid and waited for two hours before giving it to the malaria victims. It worked every time. They were not having any failures. This all sounds easy now, but I did more than 1,000 different tests over a period of one year to figure out all these “simple” things. My money was very limited and swimming pool test strips were expensive, as well as the various chemicals that I needed to do the testing. I must admit that I didn’t do anything really smart or brilliant, I just blundered along with my slight knowledge of the chemistry of metallurgy. There was also the fact that I was a research engineer in the Aerospace industry for almost"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 28 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century 25 years. I set up tests for A-bombs and that sort of thing. So I did have some experience at doing tests. I tried a dozen or more acids and a hundred combinations. The two-hour wait was okay for the doctor, but for my friend Moses Augustino it wasn’t very practical. He was always on the move and would run into cases of malaria on hi s travels. He needed a method of giving people doses within five minut es or so, as he simply could not wait two hours all the time. Stabilized Oxygen is stable because of its very high alkalinity (i.e. the opposite of acidity.) When a few drops are added to a glass of water, the alkalinity of the drops is neutralized by the water and ions in the drops become unstable and begin to release chlorine. At least that is what I thought at the time. So the question is, how do we get this to happen faster? The research waited for the purchase a nd testing of different acids, which I finally accomplished. After trying all the mi neral acids and various organic acids, I found that vinegar, which is 5% acetic acid, which is an organic acid, worked the best. Th en I made a mini breakthrough which was simple. Instead of using a glass of water, I used no water at all. I just put 20 drops of stabilized oxygen and 1/4 teaspoons of vinegar in a clean, dry, empty glass. I swirled it around to mix it. That worked, and it worked in only three minutes! I ch ecked the mixture with the chlorine strips and it showed a reading of over 5 ppm (parts per million) in only three minutes’ time. When I added 1/2 glasses of water, it diluted the mixture out to less than 1 ppm, but th e taste was terrible. The Stabilized Oxygen mixture with water doesn’t tast e too bad before the chlorine is released, but afterwards it’s pretty bad. Some people don’t seem to mind the taste. However, most people do, es pecially children, and they are the main ones who need the solution. I tried various juices to see which ones might work the best. There were two problems. First I needed somethi ng that would taste okay, but I also needed something that would not cha nge the amount of chlorine. After trying many juices and tasting a lot of drinks I settled on just plain old apple juice, the kind with no vitamin C added. I transmitted this information to my friends in Tanzania and they used it for a few months. Then something happened and I never heard from them again. I worried that my friend Moses may have been injured on one of his trips to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 29 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Kilimanjaro as he simply dropped out of contact. The doctor explained to me that he had not heard from him either. The doctor also mentioned that he was going to move. I never heard from either of them again, although I sent numerous e-mails. They gave me a great deal of help and I miss their e-mails. You may be wondering at this time what the formula for Stabilized Oxygen really is. I did finally dig ou t the formula for Stabilized Oxygen. I am sure that a lot of researcher s would have found it in 1/2 hour; but living on a desert lake with a very limited income, it took me a while. Anyone in the world can find the data now-a-days, but let me save you some trouble. The formula is NaClO 2 . The name is sodium chloriTe . That sounds like salt, but not quite. Table salt is NaCl, and the name is sodium chloriDe. Notice the difference of the next to last letter. One is chlorite , and the other is chloride . So let me tell you the real story that all the other researchers seem to have missed. Let me mention now that the chlorine I smelled was actually chlorine in the air above the solution, but there was no chlorine in the solution. I discovered that what is in the solution is Chlorine Dioxide which is much different than chlorine. Sodium chlo rite (Stabilized Oxygen) is highly alkaline, that is the opp osite of acid. When it is neutralized it becomes unstable and begins to release, not oxygen, but ch lorine dioxide. But that is where the oxygen comes in. The formula for chlorine dioxide is ClO 2 . That’s one ion of chlorine and two ions of oxygen, but the body cannot use that oxygen. It has already lost its ability to oxidize. The chlorine ion however, in this case, has a powerful ability to oxidize. Chlorine dioxide is a powerful explos ive. It cannot be contained as it will explode and destroy the container. It is always generated where it is used because it cannot be moved. Even a particle as small as one ion of chlorine dioxide will explode when it hits the right thing, namely a pathogen in the body or some other item more acidic than the body. An explosion is merely a fast chem ical reaction, releasing energy, which is usually some kind of oxidization. When a chlo rine dioxide ion meets a pathogen it accepts five electrons of charge and instantaneously results in an instant oxidizatio n, which is the explosi on. The result of this explosion (the result of this chemical reaction) is that the chlorine ion is completely neutralized. The two oxyge n ions that were a part of the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 30 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century chlorine dioxide ion are already ne utral which for oxygen is a minus 2 state. That means that the oxygen ion cannot oxidize anything; it can only become a part of the water in the body. The body cannot utilize it for any kind of oxidation. The chlorine ion becomes a chloride which basically is just table salt which has no particular power either. Both the oxygen and the chlorine now do not have any charge that will create any kind of oxidation. So you see it’s the chlorine dioxide ion (the combination of chlorine and oxygen) that does the work and it has a great deal more ability to oxidize pathogens than oxygen. Another fact is that several deep breaths of air will supply more oxygen to the human body than the stabilized oxygen is expected to supply. Since the formula was supposed to produce oxygen identical to the oxygen in the respiration process, what would be the point of taking the Stabilized Oxygen when you could just take a couple of extra breaths? Anyway, it’s a moot point. The fact is, what the researchers believed was happening was not happening. The oxygen just becomes a part of the water in the body and/or possibly becomes part of a carbon dioxide ion, but it cannot be used by the body for anything else. The Chlorine dioxide supplies electr ons. It does not supply oxygen. Basically, the chlorine dioxide ion is the oxidizer, not the oxygen. Check your chemistry book. Oxygen is not the only oxidizer. Any reaction in which electrons are transferred is considered oxidation. If the researchers that worked with Stabilized Oxygen had been able to understand modern chemistry, they may have been much more successful with their research. There is a lot more to it than this initial explanation and I intend to go over it thoroughly as I cover the story of the development of the Miracle Mine ral Supplement. It’s written so anyone can understand it. At this time I moved a few miles to the town of Mina, Nevada, where I continued writing emails to other people in Africa. Thirty miles away from where I lived in the town of Mina, is the town of Hawthorne, Nevada. There I met J. Andrew Nehring, a man that ran a small hobby shop. He had just returned from the Mayo Clinic where he had been operated on for cancer of th e pancreas. He was continuing to be tested at a hospital in a nearby cit y. Unfortunately, th e tests were still"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 31 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century positive for cancer. He had been scheduled for exploratory surgery in approximately 60 days at the Mayo clinic. While visiting a mutual friend, he heard me talking about my solution. He asked me about it and wondered if it would help his cance r. Since many people had already tried Stabilized Oxygen on cancer and had what seemed to be some success, I believed that the addition of vinegar might make it much better for cancer as it had for malaria. We both agreed to try it. I had not ye t noticed any side effects. IT IS NOT A DRUG. So he began taking the solution using vinegar as the activator. Within two weeks his can cer readings began to reduce. The high reading was 82 (whatever that m eant). At the next visit to the hospital the reading was 71. A mont h later the reading was 55. Two months later it was 29 an d so on until the reading wa s less than five. The doctors at the hospital didn’t know wh at happened, but as soon as the readings began to go down, they ca nceled the appointment at the Mayo clinic. They wanted to see what might be happening. When the reading reached three, they said there was no poi nt in further testing. This is just one of a number of cancer stories in the past 10 years in which the cancer just went away while taking the MMS. So at that time, my plan was still to get this information to the world one way or another. I developed a plan where I would put some of the story on the Internet to be distributed throughout the world. The way I planned to do this was to have the information in an e-mail ready to send out to the world. I wanted it to be distributed similarly to the way viruses are often sent. When a pe rson received this MMS information it would have a tiny program that woul d allow the person who received it to easily send it out to every email address on his computer. But of course he would be in total contro l. A person would only have to push one button and the complete inform ation concerning using and making the MMS would go out to every email a ddress on his computer that he so designated. Do you see how fast that could propag ate across the worl d? It would go fast, but there are disadvantages. A book is even better, because not nearly the amount of information in a book could be put into emails. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 32 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I sold the one thing that I had, a speci al process for recovery of gold. I received $17,000 for the process. I searched around on the Internet and finally found a company that claimed they could develop such a distribution program. I started working with them to get the program done. I paid $5,000 up front and several thousand as the program progressed and a large sum at the end. The program never worked. So I never got a working program and I had spent my money. Just to be fair, let me tell you the name of the company that refused to furnish me with a working program after I gave them $14,000. It was Danube Technologies, Inc. in Seattle Washington. They said when I made the final payment they would send me the working program. Their first proposal to me was dated 9 April 2001. My final payment to them was 11 November 2001. The program never came close to working. They claime d it did. They also said that the program was illegal. They would not do anything more. Now, 6 years later I am finally selling this book. I know you think that with such a great Miracle Mineral Supplement, philanthropists like Opra Winfrey and Bill Gates would stand in line to give me money to carry out our missi on, but not so. It takes a while to get it figured out, but finally you rea lize it is all based on money or the desire for prestige. Oprah wants to know what is going to bring her TV program the biggest audience because that is what brings in the money, and Bill Gates gets no prestige for helping the little guy. His millions go to the big pharmaceutical laboratorie s which in turn bring him powerful friends throughout the worl d. To invest in some thing that works but reduces the income of the pharmaceutical companies would be unthinkable. He said over the phone he would not back us until we had FDA approval. That takes a hundre d million dollars and he knew we would never have that. I sent many letters to these people an d dozens of other organizations. It wasn’t, for the most part, that they wouldn’t believe me. For a hundred years the medical people and the pharmaceutical people with their billions of dollars have stood shoulde r to shoulder using the laws enacted by congress to hold the alternative medi cine people at bay. They have made them look like quacks and charlata ns, but the fact is that millions of Americans have discovered that they are not. Despite medical"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Further Development of the MMS Chapter 2 Page 33 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century warnings, every year more and mo re people discover answers in the alternative medicine area and now it is a many billion dollar business. You can’t possibly think that millions of Americans are so stupid that they would prefer quacks and charlata ns if they were not getting real help with their health problems. It may surprise you to know that 55% of the American public now use alte rnate medicine and have quit going to the family medical doctor. That’s why they are so frantic to get all supplements under the control of medical people. And now, since the first edition of this book, th e FDA has announced its intentions of shutting down at least 50% of the alternative medical businesses. The new law enacted by congress gives the FDA the right to require that all supplement s be tested to prove th eir efficacy. That means that the FDA can stop any supplement at any time and require testing. It could cost up to $100,000,000 for a singl e supplement. While more than 900,000 people die from drugs each year , the health industry does not average one death a year. But should someone even report being sick from a health supplement the FDA can and does stop every supplement of that kind in the country. In several cases, even though nothing was wrong, the supplement was never allowed back on the shelves. Now with this new law, just from what they have said they are going to do, it is obvious that the FDA intends that nothing but drugs will eventually be available to those who are sick. Please tell your frie nds about this book.

Dick Johnson, a friend, did this to help me out with my research. It gave me a few extra dollar s to help with my research and investigation of the Stabilized Oxygen. During the first year there I met Arnold, a man of many talents. I have changed hi s name, in this case to protect the guilty, because I am not going to say very many good things about him, though I will say a few. The Stabilized Oxygen mixture has been renamed several times since I began to make the solution in my k itchen. It is not easy to get the chemical sodium chlorite, but if you keep at it you can get some. (I’ll tell you how to get it in Book II. It is available in many chemical supply houses.) I began making the solution much stronger than the Stabilized Oxygen that is sold on the market. For many years Stabilized Oxygen was 3.5% sodium chlorite. At this time my solution, which I have named The Miracle Mineral Suppl ement (MMS), is 28% sodium chlorite. That’s eight times strong er than regular Stabilized Oxygen. When I am making trips into the jungle, it means I can carry eight times as much “healing power” as the orig inal Stabilized Oxygen formula. Let me explain what has happened. The researchers over the past 80 years have done their tests using from 5 to 20 drops, at the most, of the 3.5% solution. As I started helpi ng people with malaria and other problems, when a few drops didn’t wo rk, I just gave them more. In all the research I have been able to read concerning Stabilized Oxygen, no one increased the drops beyond 25 drops and very few ever used that many. Where did the old idea go that if 10 drops is good, 40 drops is 4 times as good? The only precaution that I took was that I always tried the heavier doses on myself first. Ge nerally, I was dealing with people who wanted to get well, and they agreed to try it after I had tested it. I didn’t go from 10 drops of stabilized oxygen to 120 direc tly, but I finally wound up at 120 drops and used a sec ond 120 drops one hour later. I did it a little at a time until I found out what it took to handle a problem. It is"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 35 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century not a drug; it is a mineral supplement. I am an inventor, not a doctor. I don’t even know what the Hippocratic Oath says; I am not trying to do what doctors do. My goal has been to invent a way to help the immune system overcome malaria ever since I thought it was possible and I did accomplish that. In my opinion, I have never put anyone at risk and I have helped over 2,000 people pe rsonally. Over 75,000 people have overcome malaria with the help of people I trained. The people treated were “cured” with no deaths reported in the bunch. Normally over 300 deaths could be expected. When I say “cu red” I’m referring to the fact that they got up, smiled, put their cl othes on and went back to work. They have not relapsed, as far as we can tell. Did we do double blind and triple bli nd tests? No. The money was not available. Bill Gates told us over the phone that he would not help until we were FDA approved. Usually, FDA approval costs millions, but those people in Africa that went ba ck to work feeling good didn’t care if we had FDA approval or not. When I phoned the FDA they said that if I was using it in Africa they had no say over there so they would not comment, but if I wanted to get it approved for treatment of malaria in America, then that would be another st ory. They didn’t care if it was not a drug. The minute I said treatment of any disease, it then becomes a drug and you must have all of th e countless tests and laboratory evaluations. That’s anywhere from $50,000,000 upwards. The country of Malawi has accepted MMS as a mineral supplement that can be given to anyone, including those who are sick. They have shown a bit of reasonable logic. It isn’t likely to happen here in the U.S. The doctors and pharmaceutical companies have lobbied congress to the tune of billions of dollars to have all th e laws written in their favor to produce money for them. In the U.S. every year over 900,000 people die from medical drug related causes. Howeve r, when just one single person died in one year from an am ino acid found in a health food store, the FDA ordered all of that amino acid to be removed from all health food stores in the U.S. in spite of the fact that it has helped more people than most drugs. Now, years later, that amino acid is still not allowed. The drug companies and the FDA are always ready to pounce on anything that might eat into the profits of pharmaceutical companies. In this particular case that amino acid was replacing a drug. It was costing the drug companies money."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 36 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century So long as one is using a mineral supplement in the attempt to make people feel better, there is no criticism.

You must be a doctor, you must do clinical trials, and you must have 100 million dollars for double blind tests and triple blind tests, and dozens of other requirements. No one offers to furnish the money; they just tell you what you are required to do. How dare you try to treat someone for a disease! That’s for doctors and pharmaceutical companies only. There are many people in America who realize that drugs only treat the symptoms, not the causes of a dis ease. Why would a company even bother to research treating the symptoms of a disease instead of attempting to find a cure for the disease? Does anyone ever ask that question? Well, a lot of us do, but not the FDA. The an swer is this, so long as you are treating the sympto ms, you won’t cure the disease and you can go on selling that dr ug until the person dies. Several wealthy people offered to pay for distributing the MMS throughout the country of Haiti. They wanted to eliminate malaria in Haiti. But when we approached more than 15 clinics there, we found that they were controlled by doctors in the U.S. The doctors in the U.S. were totally determined that we could not give a single person our mineral supplement. Haiti went without the supplement and thousands still have malaria. In any case, it only takes 15 drops of Miracle Mineral Supplement (MMS) for the first do se given to a malaria patient followed an hour later with another 15 drops. This is because the MMS is eight times stronger than regular Stabilized Oxygen. If you were using regular Stabilized Oxygen, you would need 120 drops at first and then another 120 drops in 1 hour after that. Has anyone been hurt? No. Thousa nds of people later there are only thousands of happy, well people with none claiming any lasting, negative side effects. In actuality, there ar e a few instant react ions in about one out of a hundred people, but that’s not a side effect. The reaction normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Look it up in a me dical dictionary"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 37 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century or on the Internet. Side effects are the effect that a drug has on healthy cells that are not a part of the disease. Instant reactions are the result of the body adjusting because the MMS is affecting diseased cells or disease causing germs. There ar e no effects on healthy cells. We know that the MMS (28% sodium chlorite) generates chlorine dioxide (that’s CLO 2 ) when mixed with vinega r. The reason why it produces chlorine dioxide when mixed with vinegar is because the acetic acid (in the vinegar) causes the solution to be ne utralized or, better than that, causes it to be slightly acidic. The MMS solution is normally extremely alkaline. When it is made acidic, by adding the vinegar, it becomes slightly unstable and it begins to release chlorine dioxide. By measuring the drops and the acetic acid we know that it creates about 3 mg of chlorine dioxide in approxim ately three minutes. Then when we add apple juice (or other juice without vitamin C) it dilutes the solution so that there is about 1 ppm of chlorine dioxide in the total apple juice mixture. The MMS solution continues to generate chlorine dioxide but now at a much slower rate. About chlorine dioxide: Chlorine a nd chlorine dioxide have been used to purify water and kill pathogens in hospitals and for many other antiseptic uses for more than 100 years. Lately chlorine dioxide has been used more and more frequently, especi ally to purify water. It is also authorized by the FDA to be used to clean chicken, beef and other foods. Research has proven chlorine dioxide to be much safer than chlorine, as it is selective for pathogens when used in water and it does not create compounds from other constituents in the water, which chlorine does. Simple chemistry tells us that without doubt the same situ ation exists in the body. It has been proven that chlo rine in drinking water creates at least three different carcinogenic co mpounds when it enters the body, but no such compounds have been found from chlorine dioxide. The American Society of Analytical Chem ists stated in 1999 that chlorine dioxide was the most powerful pathogen killer known to man. If this is the case, and it is, th en you would have thought that the pharmaceutical companies would have said to themselves, “Hmm, if chlorine dioxide is such a powerful k iller of bacteria, viruses, and other germs, and since it is used to kill viruses on food throughout that industry, maybe, just maybe it could be used to kill those things in the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 38 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century human body.” But no, they wanted a drug that makes you feel a little bit better and can be sold over and over ag ain. No point in using something that’s going to cure someone on the first dose! Pharmaceutical companies should have discovered it 100 years ago, but they didn’t. You might say that is just my opinion, my truth, but I am going to have to call it a fact because it is such an obvious trut h. There is no excuse why research has not been conducted with a solution that has been used for 100 years to kill disease causing germs. The pharmaceutical companies not only didn’t do the research, but they actually refused to test the Stabilized Oxygen many times. So what happens when you put Stabilized Oxygen in the body? It goes down into the stomach at first. There are dozens of research papers which state that when it comes in contact with strong stomach acids, it breaks down into oxygen immediately. They haven’t however stated the tests that prove this hypothesis. I us ed stomach acids in a test glass and that result never happened. Even when I tripled the strength of the acid in the glass to three times what w ould normally be found in the stomach, it never broke the sodium chlorite do wn immediately. In fact, it never increased the speed of production of chlorine dioxide beyond maybe 100th of a milligram per hour, in other words, practically nothing. And, of course, creating chlorine diox ide and sodium (tiny insignificant amounts of sodium) is all that can ha ppen when the sodium chlorite does break down. There isn’t anything else left. That is all that’s there. The chlorine dioxide “explodes” when touching various items of lower acidity than the body by accepting fi ve electrons with tremendous energy. It will almost always be things that are bad for the body. Otherwise, it simply bounces off the healthy cells. Ther e is more about this later in the book (s ee chapter 14). Again ch lorine dioxide is the oxidizer here, not oxygen. Without the use of vinegar, lemon, lim e or citric acid, a tiny amount of chlorine dioxide is all that will be produced. Any benefit from the Stabilized Oxygen has to be derived from the tiny amount of chlorine dioxide because there is nothing else except an insignificant amount of sodium. Because there was indeed so me benefit from Stabilized Oxygen we know that the chlorine dioxide was doing it. The oxygen that is finally released by the chlorine di oxide is not useable by the body. Because all Stabilized Oxygen sold on the market today is a solution of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 39 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century sodium chlorite, there are no electrolytes of usable oxygen to be derived from Stabilized Oxygen. With the addition of vinegar the conditi ons change drastically. At first, with the 20 drops and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of full strength vinegar, the body receives an amount of about 3 milligrams of chlorine dioxide in the mixture when the apple juice has been added to the dose mixture. The solution then continues to generate chlorine dioxide for the next 12 hours within the body. The red blood cells that normally carry oxygen throughout the body have no mechanism to differentiate betw een chlorine dioxide and oxygen. Thus, in the walls of the stomach wh ere the blood picks up nutrients of various kinds, when a chlorine diox ide ion touches a red blood cell it is accepted. If there happens to be a ma laria parasite present it will be destroyed and the chlorine dioxide will be destroyed as well. If there are no parasites present, the chlorine dioxide will be carried by the red blood cell to some part of the body wher e oxygen would normally be used to oxidize poisons and other bad things. There the chlorine dioxide is released. The chlorine dioxide ha s over a hundred times more energy to do the same thing that the oxygen w ould do but it still won’t hurt any healthy cells, more than likely because the immune system has the chlorine dioxide under control. This is the point where I like to compare the ch lorine dioxide ion to a good Tasmanian devil and the disease germs to bad Terrorists. The Tasmanian devil is a small fellow, but is known for his ferocity. The red blood cell is the bus that carries oxygen, and the conductor doesn’t care. He will also carry the Tasmanian devil. Taz, the chlorine dioxide, is let off by the red blood cell at approximately the same spot that oxygen would normally be let off. The terrorists are not even worried. They can handle Mr. Oxygen. But this time there is a surprise. The guy that gets o ff the bus is ferocious. He’s much worse than the oxygen that normally ge ts off. He jumps out and kills every single terrorist that is presen t that is harmful to the body. So when the red blood cell bus arrives, MEET TAZ. If the chlorine dioxide does not hit anything that can set it off, it will begin to deteriorate and thus gain an electron or two. This may allow it"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 40 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century to combine with other substances, creating a very important substance that the immune system utilizes to make hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is probably the most important acid of the immune system. It kills pathogens, killer ce lls, even cancerous cells with this acid. When the body has a deficiency in the important substance from which the immune system creates the hypochlorous acid, it is called myeloperoxidase deficiency. Many people are afflicted with this deficiency and the deficiency may increase during diseased situations because the immune system needs a gr eat deal more of this acid when a disease is present. There are some suppositions here. In any case we definitely know that chlorine dioxide is made in the body from sodium chlorite and it then kills the hell out of pathogens. There is one other function that the chlorine dioxide does in the body. It tends to neutralize poisons. Almost all substances that are poisonous to the body are, to some extent, acidic in nature or below the neutrality of the body. The chlorine dioxide will neutralize many of these poisons. We believe that can be the only explanation why a malaria victim often goes from totally sick to totally well in less than four hours. The poisons that malaria generates ar e neutralized by the chlorine dioxide at the same time the parasites are killed. I gave some chlorine dioxide to a dog that was bitten by a rattlesnake. I gave him a drink of the solution every 1/2 hour. The dog seemed to know it would help him and he drank it right down each time I gave it to him. He was okay in a few hours, which would indicate that the poison was pr obably neutralized by the chlorine dioxide. While I was living in Mina, Nevada, I was finally able to order the first whole drum of 100 pounds of sodium ch lorite. Actually, the same friend that helped me by providing a place for me to stay in Mina bought the first 100 pound drum of sodium chlorite. He dropped by and took a few pounds to keep for himself as that w ould ensure that he would never be without it. For the record, his name is Richard Johnson. I began to help some people here in town and some people began to buy the solution that I bottled here in my kitchen. There are a number of people here in town that now has been using the MMS for several years. I have sent bottles all over the world. Many people have used it to help with cancer and every other disease that you can thi nk of that might be caused by"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 41 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century bacteria, viruses, molds, yeast or any other pathogen. Eventually, as mentioned previous ly, I was approached by Arnold, a businessman who lived in Reno a nd who also owned a nonworking gold mill here in Mina. He asked me to do some gold assays. We began talking and when I mentioned that I had help people with malaria, he was extremely impressed. We talked on several occasions’ times and in time we finally signed a contract. In the c ontract he agreed to finance making the MMS available throughout the wo rld. He wanted to put up an Internet site in Budape st and sell MMS to the world from Budapest. I found him to be like many other wealthy men who think MMS is great. They want to get others to invest money, but they don’t want to invest any themselves. He began talking to numerous people about the MMS and was able to interest many groups which were “humanitarian.” He called me and told me about each new group that he was talking to concerning investing in the MMS for malaria in Africa. Arnold is a great humanitari an. He works to help the homeless in Reno. He always stops to help anyone who might be broken down on the highway. He supplies a truckload of clothes and other items to an orphanage in Mexico each year. Many times when homeless or people down on their luck arrive in Mina he will either give them a job himself or somehow get them a job with someone else here in town. He also helps out at various places in Reno including distributing meals to the homeless at Christmastime. He has been quite helpful to me in many ways and has worked toward gettin g the MMS distributed in Africa for the last 6 years. The problem was he never kept any of the agreements in the contract I made with him. Instead, he kept finding people who w ould “potentially” finance the MMS distribution in Afri ca for malaria victims. We were always just weeks or months away from getting the money to distribute the MMS in Africa or to get the money to conduct clinical trials to prove to the world that it works. Arnold began to use the MMS to help people, as he is very compassionate toward people who are sick. He personally gave MMS to many people after overseeing that they knew how to use it correctly. He found veterans who had malaria that kept coming back and provided MMS for them. That was one way that he proved to himself that it"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 42 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century worked. However, I began to see that he would not let me talk to any of the groups that he had interested in helping to finance the distribution of MMS to the world. I don’ t know what his reasoning was, but it seems he is not as effective dealing with peopl e as he thinks he is. Group after group lost interest in the MMS and simply did not continue with him and his ideas. Group after group or person after person came and went away. Living out here in the dese rt, I never got to talk to any of these people or groups. I was always told about th e people or the groups, but never allowed to talk to them. Even when I asked to be allowed to talk to these people Arnold would not discuss it. Th is continued for five years. He made many mistakes, such as, hiring a young kid to do our web site, who then sued us when we insisted th at the web site be done the way we wanted. The kid took us to court a nd also sent lette rs to government agencies saying that we were crooked and our MMS solution was a fake. Those letters prevented us from getting a letter from the IRS stating that we were a nonprofit group. At the be ginning of the wri ting of this book (10/1/2006), now 5 years beyond the time he was supposed to get the Web Site done, 10/1/2001 and thousands of dollars later, we still don’t have a Web Site. Four additional pe ople that have been hired have all bombed out and took our money and produced nothing. Had I been able to use some of this money that was lost, I could have completed clinical trials in Kenya. Arnold also hired a grant writer who al so began to work against us. Arnold was very bad with people while always thinking that he was especially good. I mention th is negative stuff only to point out why I had to write this book. It’s part of the story and getting the information to the world is and has been my purpose. I should reaffirm that I do not thin k that Arnold is a bad guy. But I finally realized that if I stayed with him it would have to be his way or nothing. If I wanted to get this info rmation to the world I had to leave that partnership. It wasn’t happ ening Arnold’s way and he would not allow any other way. Thus, I had to get away where I could do it the way I knew it would work. The year at this time was 2006 and I could no longer justify keeping this information from the world. There were and are millions of people who need the MMS. How could we allow those to die who could be saved? The answer for me at that time was I could not. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 43 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I called a friend, Ed Heft, who had a house in Mexico located near on a bay just off of the Sea of Cortez. He immediately invited me to come down and finish the book. He said I could live there at no charge for rent. It was an ideal offer for me. I accepted. So I packed my bags and left about mid November 2006. But I am getting ahead of my story. There were several other important ev ents that took place before I left. See Chapter 4. UPDATE For 3 rd Edition. The continuing story from the 2nd Edition. I will put the update here because there really isn’t a good other place for it. So I arrived in Mexico somewhere below the border and stayed in a house right on a bay off of the Sea of Cortez. I continued to write my book. I am sure anyone familiar with Mexico would know where I was, but I’ll not name the place for now. Christmas came and went and I conti nued to write. Finally the book was finished some time in about March 2007. I had saved enough money from the job Arnold had given me of cleaning up the old gold mill to buy the first 1000 books. The time was al so spent in putti ng together a Web Site. Not a very good one, but as it turned out, it did the job; it sold books. Only a few books sold as I was not very good a Web advertising, but the book got to a few of the right people and some of them began making the formula of MMS and selling it righ t away. One company, especially, began to sell large amounts immediat ely. They knew how to advertise on the Web and they sold thousands of bottles of MMS. For the record their name was Global Light. My book sold for $14.95 and that helped out quite a bit. I also made two ebooks. I divided the hard book, The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century, into 2 parts. I made the downl oad of the firs t part of the book (Part 1) free of charge. Then if they wanted to read the second part it cost them $9.95. That worked fairly well, for every 15 people that read Part 1, one person would purchase and downloa d part 2. And since there was no cost to me for part 2 it was mostly profit. The selling of MMS is what really st arted the ball rolling. Of course, I"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 44 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century was down here in Mexico and couldn’ t send books out from here. I had the book company ship the books to Clara Tate who became my secretary in Nevada. She shipped al l the books out from there. Soon I realized that we were running out of books. I need ed to make the next order right away. Things started to go better. One company called me up and offered to help by purchasing a large order. I decided to sell the next edition, the 2 nd Edition for $19.95. So the purchase of 500 books at ½ prices would give me $5000 dollars immediately, which was all that the printing company required up front. My friend in Canada, Kenneth Richardson, said that he would pay the rest of the cost when the books were ready to be delivered to Clara in Nevada. I couldn’t lose, although I had no money to speak of, everything was bei ng paid for. This order for the 2 nd Edition was for 10,000 books. There were a number of people who in terviewed me on the radio and on various web associations. The sales of my book increased up to about an average of $350 a day including the ebook and hard copy. I’d like to name all that helped, but there were too many and if I left anyone out it wouldn’t be fair and there isn’t en ough room in this book. One person who I think was especially effec tive in keeping my book selling was Adam Abraham with his radio show “Talk for food.” Getting the book sales to increase over the amount mentioned above has been tough. It has hung in there at that level for months. I will be working on that. I have been able to use some of the money for helping in Africa, but for the most part, I am saving the money for when I travel to Africa. I found that I couldn’t li ve on the bay and still get everything done that I wanted to get done. Most of the computer things and other supplies are available in a large Mexican city 60 miles away and I needed to move there. Meanwhile there were those who enc ouraged me to get the book printed in Spanish and with the money from the sales of the books I was able to do that. If found a nice lady in town who wanted to help and soon had an agreement with her to start a Mexican company to sell Spanish books"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Stabilized oxygen, MMS and a Contract Chapter 3 Page 45 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century and MMS as well. I moved to town and was lucky to rent rooms from the Spanish lady’s family. One room I made into an office for computers, and one room was for me to sleep in. The family was very good to me. I hired the sister of th e lady who was working with me to start the Mexican company as my secr etary. The mother there took great care of me and my clothes were washed and ironed and my bed was made. I was no longer alone. The Mexican company that we were making was extremely important as the NAFTA treaty states th at any products that are legal in one country is legal in the other countries of the agreement as well. That meant that if we could get the MMS registered and legal in Mexico it would also be legal in the US and Canada. We co uld circumvent a lot of problems in the US. Also, of course, I would make money here on MMS. I had decided to not sell MMS in the US as that might help get MMS accepted and selling, since people could not accuse me of trying to make money on a snake oil. And that may have helped in the beginning, but it is priced so low that it seems no one car es if I make some money from the sales of not. I won’t try to sell an y MMS in the US, but a number of companies who are selling MMS have agreed to donate to my African fund. One more thing, Nexus magazine decided to get my book translated into German and published which they did with an agreement to pay me a royalty. So, in all this time, with thousands of people cured there have been many people who want to help, but there has been no one with money who has stepped up to the plate and said, “L et me help.” Many rich guys have refused when I asked. But it actually looks like the sales of the book will do well enough to produce the money to cure at least one country in Africa. It actually looks like th e project will get done. But what continues to amaze me is that with millions of dollars spent on frivolous stuff each year, the world goes blithel y marching on not realizing that the human race is marked for extinctio n and refusing to see the evidence staring them in the face when just a tiny amount of that frivolous money could change things. See Chapter 9.5, the last part, for more information on this."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Dr. Flomo  Chapter 4  Page 46 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Chapter 4  Dr. Flomo I signed the contract wi th Arnold in 2001. Arnold talked to numerous people concerning the MMS (which we called OS-82) about helping the people of malaria in Africa. He al ways had someone that he believed might help provide us with funds so that we could first prove the MMS worked. Then we could ask the world to help us cure Africa. I remained in Mina, Nevada, continuing to write emails to people in Afri ca. Many didn’t believe me and some even asked me not to write them again. Somewhere around July of 2003, my emails to Africa paid off. I finally got in touch with a doctor in Guinea, West Africa. His name was Dr. Moses Flomo, Sr. I began telling him of the results that we had obtained in Tanzania. He was interested. I sent him a bottle of the MMS and he tried it on a single malaria patient who was well in only hours. He immediately went to the office of the Ministry of Health. Dr. Gamy was the Deputy Minister of Health at that time in Guinea. This picture shows Dr. Moses Flomo, Sr. Dr. Flomo was able to deal with one of the doctors in the office of the Ministry of Health who then authorized him to test 25 people. He was to test those 25 people wit hout charge. If the MMS worked he could then begin charging people for the MMS as a treatment for malaria. Dr. Flomo put a large sign outside his clinic which said, “Free treatment for malaria.” Within hours he had mo re than 25 people signed up and he treated them the same day.

People started lining up outside of his office. He continued treating people for a few weeks. Unfortunate ly, Dr. Flomo couldn’t really see the value of the MMS. He believed that he could make a lot of money from selling herb formulas in capsule form. The malaria thing was only something that he was doing to get me to help him with the herbs. I agreed to help him as long as he wa s working with malaria. He wanted me to send him some empty capsules, and some herb books, and a capsule filling machine, and other s upplies. When I sent his package containing some books and a small semi automatic capsule machine, his post office held it. He got so upset with them that he closed his clinic. It didn’t make a lot of sense to me, ex cept he wasn’t from Guinea and he thought that was the reason he was being treated badly. We later found that the postmaster ha d taken the package and put it on his desk. The next day he took sick and the package remained on his desk for two weeks. An accide nt happened and the package was essentially destroyed by rain. Dr. Flomo decided to go out to an America Bauxite Company, the biggest one in that part of the worl d. He knew one of the doctors in the company clinic. So he took some MM S to the doctor and explained how it worked. They began treating workers who had malaria with the MMS. In all they treated about 2,000 people. At that time they reduced absenteeism by over 50%. Dr. Flomo began negotiating with them to sell them 150 bottles of MMS for $60,000 US money. That’s $400 U.S. per bottle. I had never intended to sell the bottles for more than $26 US, but Flomo insisted that we could use the money to set up a clinic. Since we had never settled on an exact price, I said okay. After all, that was still somewhat less than $1 U.S. per treatment. At that time, Arnold didn’t have complete control of the Malaria Solution. He hadn’t yet figured out how to get complete control. I still had some say in how things were ha ndled. Later, Arnold said that the people that were putting up the mone y wanted him to have complete control. At this time I was able to allow Dr. Flomo to sell the MMS. Later I was not allowed to do such things. There were some glitches to the Bauxite Company transaction and quite a bit of time passed. I determined the main problem was that Dr. Flomo was making trips elsewhere working on th e herb plan that he had. It was"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Dr. Flomo  Chapter 4  Page 48 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century quite an extensive plan. He planne d to have many acres planted with various different herbs. Dr. Flomo would not allow me to talk to the doctors at the Bauxite clinic. We had to go through him and he was busy elsewhere.  This is a picture of Dr. Flomo’s herb clinic. I decided to tell Arnold about the possi ble sales. That was a mistake. Arnold then tried to call the clinic at the America Bauxite Company but he couldn’t get the right phone number. Then he got in touch with the U.S. Company that owned the Bauxite Company and got the phone number of the president of the America Bauxite company in Guinea. The president said that he would not use our MMS (O S-82) until some university had published a paper stati ng that they had tested the MMS and that it worked. That ended th e $60,000 sale of bottles to the Bauxite company clinic, as the doctors there were informed that they could not use the MMS. Had we not tried to go through the front office, the doctors in the back would have continued to use the MMS. (This was a flub by Arnold. I didn’t want to stir things up in the front office of the American Bauxite Company as I realized that th ings were delicately balanced.) If they had already been using th e MMS for six months and the absenteeism had been reduced 50% dur ing that time, no one would have said stop. As it was, the front office was never informed that they had already treated 2,000 people.

He would have been the best known doctor in that part of the world. He chose to continue to try to sell he rbs, which never did work. We would have furnished unlimited quantities of MMS to Dr. Flomo. He could have changed a whole country, but he just had to try to sell his herbs. Picture: Dr. Flomo and a local herb alist preparing herbal formulas. If you read chapter 18 you can see his mistake. He was so focused on his own goals; he simply couldn’t adjust his vision to see a bigger picture. He wasn’t interested in helping the people of that country; he was only interested in making money.

We were planning on getting the money from one of the humanitarian sources but that sti ll wasn’t going anywhere. Finally it occurred to me that with a $5 cost we could offer to make a large donation to FCF Int. I told Ar nold and he thought it was a valid idea.  Arnold offered to give them $200,000 worth of the MMS if they would furnish the money to send me to their missions to train their people how to use the OS-82 (That’s what we were calli ng MMS at the time). The name has changed a number of times. Since we had put the price of a dose at $5 we could make $200,000 worth for about $50. Let me just mention here that it was my idea. The 2,000 people treated in Guinea, the 5,000 people treated in Sierra Leone, and the 75,000 people treated in Uganda and Kenya have all been the direct result of my ideas. Yes, Arnold helped, but he didn’t come up with the ideas nor di d he contact the people in Guinea or Sierra Leone. I did it without any financing from Arnold.

At the writing of this 2 nd edition there are more than 4 manufacturers making the MMS. The bot tles that we finally decided upon were tall dark green four ounce bottles with a droppe r top so that drops could be dispensed from the bottle as long as there was any solution inside. I was reasonably sure that no other similar bottles would be present in Africa and I was correct. A bottle with the malaria solution could be recognized a block away, as nothing else was similar. So far the other people are still using the same green bottle bought from a company in New York. The company’s name and address is given in Chapter 17.  Dr. Opondo with bottles of MMS on the table. I arrived in Kakamega, Kenya, on January 31, 2004. I was met at the airport by four people who each ga ve me a hug. There was Javan Ommani the head minister of the mission there, Gladis Ayugu, Hezron Juma, the second in command at the mi ssion, and finally Beatic Iadeche. They were very glad to see me and they were very gracious. I was driven to the Mission where they had a very nice room fixed with mosquito netting and everyt hing that I would need. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  Page 52 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Doctor Isaac Opondo came to see me that evening. He was responsible for the mission hospital and he had b een told that I was going to be giving people something to help with malaria. He was worried. He really needed to know what I was goi ng to be giving th em. I realized that if he didn’t like me or the MMS that he could shut everything down and nothing would happen. I woul d simply be going back home with nothing accomplished. So I began to explain exactly what the MMS was and how it worked. He understood chlorine dioxide because his scientific knowledge included water purification plants and disinfectants. I told him most of the things already mentioned in this book plus other data. He was interested. I have found the exact facts work better than anything else and that is what I gave him. Finally, Dr. Opondo said, “I have the pi cture and if you can really get the chlorine dioxide into the body, I believe it will do exactly what you say it will do.” Once he had the picture of th e chlorine dioxide in his head, he was so convinced that he said, “My wi fe is sick with malaria. Can I go get her right now?” I sai d, “Sure.” She arrived about 20 minutes later. I mixed an MMS drink for her of only five drops. I considered 15 drops to be a standard dose at that time and I do not remember exactly why I only used five drops. I guess I was worr ied about making her nauseous. So Dr. Opondo’s wife was the first person I helped overcome malaria in Africa. The next morning she was fee ling a little better but she was not completely well, and I had told him that she would be well. I was scheduled to start treating at the hosp ital that morning. That was actually a problem, but not as bad as you might think. The doctor believed my explanation of the chlorine dioxide and he seemed to have faith in what I had to say. The problem was that the strain of malaria here was more virile than the strain of malaria in South America. In seeing that the doctor’s wife was indeed a little better, I knew it was"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  Page 53 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century working but that it simply was not a large enough dose. I told the doctor that his wife just needed another dose and he agreed. That morning when I began treating people at the mission hospital, I put on my white lab smock with the words “The Malaria Solution Foundation” embroidered in gold lettering on the front. I wore my hat, light tan pants and white shoes. I l ooked like a doctor. I arrived at the hospital at about 8 A.M. and Dr. O pondo set me up in his office. I of course, explained to the people in the office that I was not a doctor. They didn’t care. I was the only whit e man for 50 miles in any direction and they all had a great deal of respect for white men. I discussed the number of drops to be given each patient with Dr. Opondo. I pointed out that the malari a here seemed to be a stronger strain than that in South America. We decided to use 15 drops per dose. Soon his wife arrived to get her next dose. She received a second dose which was 15 drops and went on home . We gave the patients 15 drop doses all day, but the next day most of them came back, feeling better, but not well. That did it. I decided on 30 drop doses as we needed to get cures with only one dose. There were too many malaria victims to have to handle each one twice. The hospital laboratory was overloade d. We simply could not check every sick person’s blood for malaria. However, in that area there isn’t much question about whether or not a person has malaria. Normally a doctor merely looks at a person and recognizes malaria. But they did take as many blood samples as were practical. All persons who tested positive to malaria by blood sample eventually tested negative after the second dose, or after the 30 drop dose. It usually took about four hours to have all malaria symptoms gone. In a few cases, it would take up to 12 hours for the symptoms to disappear. Although many had other diseases as well as malaria, we never had a failure as far as the malaria was concerned. We cannot guarantee that fact, as"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  Page 54 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century everyone was not blood tested; but to the best of our knowledge there were no failures to kill the malaria parasite. We treated the ones that were still feeling bad and all were recovered when they returned the next day. Dr. Opondo agreed with me that we should increase the dose to 30 drops. It began to work with only one treatment. This was eight times the dose that was used in South America. This would equal 240 drops of stabilized oxygen sold in health food stores. At the hosp ital, each malaria victim was introduced to me and those who could speak English would describe their symptoms a little bit. I gave a dose to everyone. I did not try to just help the malaria victims. I knew that the MMS woul d be good for most any problem that they had. Some would soon throw up worms, and many others said that various difficulties were better. The Reverend Ommini was head of the mission there and he looked a little tired. He told me that ever since his accident he had not had any trouble with malaria. He walked with a cane and he had some steel braces in his leg. He said that maybe the steel was somehow causing a reaction in his blood that was killing the malaria pa rasites. I looked in his eyes and face very closely. I co uld only see extreme tiredness. He was sick and didn’t know it. I asked if he was taking pain tablets, and he admitted that he took several each da y. I said, “Reverend, please do me a favor and have your blood tested for malaria.” All of a sudden it seemed to occur to him; he realized how he really felt. Picture: Dr. Vincent Orimba talks with a mother about her baby who has just taken some MMS . "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  Page 55 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I had actually meant for him to have the blood test the next day, but he took one more look at me and he went to wake up the laboratory technician. In about one hour he came back with an amazing report. The average malaria patient that show ed up for treatment at the hospital had a reading of plus six. Rev. Ommi ni had a reading of plus 120. He could have dropped dead at any minute. I gave him the biggest dose that I felt would be safe, which was 30 dr ops. Normally a person with that high of a reading would be sick in bed almost unable to move but the pain killers in some cases will mask the symptoms. The next morning Rev. Ommani felt mu ch better, but he was sick again by noon. At noon his blood was reading plus six which was a normal reading for a person sick with malari a. I gave him another 18 drops and by the next morning he was proclaimi ng that he felt great. He looked good. His blood read zero malaria parasi tes. He was lucky that it turned out this way. It happens many times that people take pain tablets to mask the pain of malaria. They don’t realize it is malaria just as Rev. Ommani had not, but he believed in me. They keep taking more and more pain tablets as their headache and the pains in their joints get worse and worse. That is a very dangerous condition as they can be walking around with enough malaria to kill them. When this happens one can just drop dead, which does happen. Picture: People at church await our arrival. In all there were over 300 at this church. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Kenya East Africa  Chapter 5  Page 56 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Rev. Ommani began organizing churches around the area so that people with malaria could come to be treate d. Each morning about eight of us would crowd into a mini bus driven by Peter Mwangi, a local pastor who owned the mini bus. The bus was a bout 20 years old. It was only a bus shell with a motor. Everything else had been stripped out. The door hinges were far beyond wearing out. They just sort of held the door from falling off, but certainly not from rattling. Being the only white person, I had to ride up front, but then so did th ree other people. Peter was somewhat of a mechanic, so he kept the bus going. But everything in the bus was extremely worn. When an auto gets that bad and something quits working you simply pu ll it out and throw it away. After all, all you really n eed is a motor, a chassis, and wheels. Peter would drive us to several ch urches during the day and he also helped me by taking pictures. There was usually anywhere from 50 to 200 people at the various churches. They introduced me to the crowd and asked me to say something before we got started. I would talk for a minute or so, stating that it was my pleasure to be there and that I hoped that they would feel better. Then they would stand in line as I began filling the glasses that were furnished at each church. When there were several hundred pe ople I would ask for extra glasses and they would get some somehow. Then we would line up 20 or 30 glasses and I would begin putting the solution in the glasses. I had a small measuring spoon that held exac tly the right amount of solution (30 drops). Then I would add vinegar to each glass. I would then fill each glass with pineapple juic e to about three quarters full. We would give the dose to each person. (There was always the three minute wait right after adding the vinegar and before adding the juice.) Several times when the group heard that I would not be inoculating them they would express disappointment. Th ey felt that if they were not getting inoculated that the medici ne might not be powerful enough to help. However, as the day wore on at each church, people started feeling better. Headaches went away, nausea va nished, and/or muscle pains left. The people were quite surprised and pl eased so they showed it. It was always a pleasure to see the people getting better and feeling better.

We were to spend a full day at the clinic. The name of the clinic was The Bukura Community Nursing a nd Maternity Home. When we arrived, there was a big, long line of local people who needed help with malaria. We spent most of the day there and then we left them with several bottles of MMS for their use. The head man’s name was Vincent Orimba. He treated many people a nd took their blood readings both before and afterward taking the MMS. Unfortunately, his clinic was one from which the support of the Missi ons to supply them with MMS was withdrawn as far as supplying them with MMS when they suspected me of being evil. I have in cluded a picture of Dr. Orim ba at his clinic. No doubt, that he, like most of the other people in this b ook, can still be contacted.

There I gave a lecture to Wade Porter and his group of doctors and nurses. Th e lecture with the doctors and nurses was well received; they talked to me for an hour after the lecture. There were much handsha king and friendly words, but for some reason Wade and his wife deci ded I was evil so that ended their plans to treat villagers in the nearby bush. They would never communicate about it so I had no way to tell them differently. Even stranger than that, the head man at FCF Int. in the US was fired a few weeks after I returned. He was the man in that organization that made the decision to send me over there. Maybe there was no connection; but it seems funny that he was fired and I never knew the reason. Well, anyway, the story continues. From Nairobi I flew to Kampala, Uganda. I was met at the airport by Solomon Mwesige who was the main pastor of the mission there and the owner of the clinic that was c onnected to the mission. He drove me to his house. They had a room fixed up for me to stay in. Here in this area, everyone who comes into the house must take off his shoes. I didn’t notice that at first, but as soon as I did notice, I apologized and took my shoes off. They were very gracious hosts. Dinner was served every evening with everyone sitting at the table. The food was very good. In Uganda, where they are not fighting, there is plenty of food. In fact, an observer would call it a land of plenty. Solomon said that I could start using the MMS in the morning at his medical clinic. I was anxious to get started as this would be one more test in proving out th e MMS. I arrived at Solomon’s clinic, after having breakfast at his home, at a bout 8 AM on the 14th of February 2004. Patients were already arriving as Solomon had announced in his church services that I would be there.

They were charging a small fee fo r my MMS doses (OS-82 was on the labels of the bottles at that time, but I had long since quit calling it that back in Kenya, because “Malaria Solution” was the only thing any of the doctors or nurses woul d call it. And that is what we finally started calling it. The people of Africa had actually named it. When I called Arnold I gave him the new name and he immediately agreed.) I started off using the data obtained at the Kakamega mission in Kenya. I used 30 drops and almost everyone was getting sicker and vomiting after taking the drops. Of course, the next day or even hours later, they were well, but the vomiting was not popular. Something was again different with this malaria than at the other place. All those here who had malaria had enlarged spleens. Somehow the drops were reacting with this strain of malaria differe ntly. Probably had something to do with the enlarged spleens. The ma laria victims in Kakamega did not have enlarged spleens. Not everyone was vomiting and thus we continued for several days, but the people were beginning to stay away. Finally, I decided that I had to do something. I had each person take only 15 drop doses, but come back in four hours for a second dose of 15 drops. This worked out OK. The 15 drop doses did not cause anyone to vomit and soon people we re again lining up outside for a help. So, once again minor problems had been overcome.

When I mention 15 drop doses or 30 drop doses all such doses require the addition of ¼ to ½ a teaspoons of vi negar, lemon, lime, or citric acid solution (That’s 5 drops of acid fo r each drop of MMS.). Without the one of these food acids the soluti on does very little good. The food acids act as an activator that make s the solution work. One must wait three minutes before adding anything else. After the three minute wait, one can then add a 4 ounce gl ass of juice to mask so me of the taste. The juice must not have any added vitamin C. This is the reason for using fresh juice because one can be sure th at vitamin C has not been added. Almost all bottled or canned ju ice has vitamin C added as a preservative. Vitamin C is very good for you, but in this case vitamin C prevents the MMS from being effec tive in the body. So only use fresh juice. These food acids have a very important role. They cause the sodium chlorite solution to give up chlorine dioxide ions on a linear basis and it also protects the sodium chlorite from giving up too many ions at one time. This is important as one does not want the entire amount of chlorine dioxide to be released as soon as the solution reaches the stomach. The acetic acid or citric acid is necessary for the proper function of the solution in the body. Vinegar always contains acetic acid while lemons and limes contain citr ic acid. One of these acids is a necessary ingredient to the MMS.

He had a microscope and technicians who could determine the malaria parasite in the blood. During the time we were there we treated at least 50 patients who checked positive for malaria before treatment and who tested negative after treatment. However, most of the 500+ patients that we treated didn’t care. They onl y wanted to feel better. And that was the result. They always felt be tter after they took the first and second doses. The fact is that at leas t 95% of them had malaria; we just did not have time to test everyone’s blood. Still, we did have 50 verifications of people who were cleared of the malaria parasite. Shortly after I arrived at the Life Link Medical Centre I met one special pastor from the DRC Congo. His na me was John Tumuhairwe. He was interested in the MMS and after he accepted a dose he immediately began to help the people as they came in. He was very enthusiastic concerning the MMS and he talked to me extensively about going to the DRC Congo, but, I didn’t have the mone y or other support to do so. He visited a number of places in Kampal a and almost arranged it so that I could visit the army in Northern Ug anda where the fighting was taking place. I was willing to go as there was widespread malaria in the army and it would have been a significant contribution to settling the war. That would have been a very good advertisement for the MMS at the time. But John was unable to get things completely arranged while I was there. Picture: Author gives Ev.

If you read John’s recent letter to me you will see that he treated quite a few people in the Congo. Several months later I sent him 10 bottles that he used quite a bit. His letter also tells about us ing those 10 bottles. The picture shown here was taken as I first gave him so me dose of MMS. He, like most of the people named in this book, can still be contacted. As of 10/10/2006 I have just sent him another 10 bottles. A few of the malaria victims were children. Some of these children would have died without the MMS. Although reactions were infrequent, it was in this clinic that we began to notice that the reactions were often similar. As time progr essed we occasionally noticed the following reactions: (1) Dizziness. Some patients reported dizziness several hours after taking the MMS. The dizziness never lasted over one hour. When the dizziness passed the other symptoms of malaria seemed to disappear at the same time. (2) Nausea. The nausea usually occurred within 10 to 15 minutes of taking the MMS and seldom lasted more than 15 minutes. (3) Vomiting. On rare occasions someone vomited as a reaction to the MMS , but not more than once. Picture: Author mixes MMS doses in the clinic room. (4) Tiredness. The tiredness was tota l and throughout the body. It was quite amazing as I experienced this once myself several years earlier when I first took the MMS to overcome some malaria I contracted in the jungle. One feels completely lethargi c and has an inability to move. It is not really unpleasant its just a weird sensation th at’s slightly alarming. It lasts from 1 to 4 hours, no longer. (5) A combination of several or all of these reactions. Th is is rare, but it did happen once or"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Uganda, East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 70 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century twice. There is really nothing that needs to be done for any of the reactions. They all pass a nd have no lasting effects. This clinic here had at least six beds. There were several people who recovered after taking the MMS. Th e doctor there was a black man who had a great deal of compassion for children. He treated them with kindness and appeared to be very c oncerned. He saved several lives while I was there simply by being able to diagnose correctly. He questioned me very thoroughly about the MMS. I ended up telling him about my friend who had used the “S tabilized Oxygen” to inject the solution in the veins of his animal s. And I mentioned that he had injected me a couple of times. In ou r discussions I finally told him that the strength of the solution that my friend used for injection into the animals was 15 drops in 20 ml of injection solution. Toward the end of my stay there I noticed the doctor talking to groups of people who met him outside the clin ic. After he talked to several groups I asked him about them. He said that the groups consisted of an advanced AIDS patient with his re latives. I didn’t ask him what the conversation was about as it seemed that would be impolite. However, the day that I left he took me aside and said that he was going to treat some AIDS patients and that he would us e an injection. He said that he was connected to the very large Kamp ala Hospital and that he would be able to approach AIDS patients that were being sent home to die. You may feel that I would feel concern at this point, but back in Las Vegas I had my friend inject me several time s. We first used one drop, then several drops, and then a full dose two different times. There was never any adverse reaction, but the in jection did handle a very bad case of the flu. It wasn’t that I was worried about these AIDS patients; it was that I was extremely sad that we couldn’t treat every AIDS patient that was being sent home plus thos e AIDS patients in the hospital.

These three did Again the MMS releases chlorine dioxide into the body. Chlorine dioxide is the most powerful killer of pathogens of all kinds known to man. There is no reason why it wouldn’t kill AIDS viruses. It does no damage to the human body in the low concentration used in the MMS. When using direct injection into the blood you cannot use vinegar. The fact is, the blood has the same neutral level as water, thus it dilutes the MMS and causes the releas e of chlorine dioxide without vinegar over a period of a few hours without vinegar. At the time I did not encourage the doc tor, nor did I discourage him. I could not see that the injection would hurt these AIDS cases and it would probably help. After I returned home I kept in close contact with this doctor as he treated 390 AIDS patients over a period of 8 months. They were patients that had been sent home from the local Kampala Hospital assuming that they would die soon. His emails showed that 6 out of 10 AIDS cases were feelin g good and anxious to go back to work or back to their lives within three days. The other 40% recovered within 30 days. None of the cases that he was able to keep track of had a relapse. Two out of th e 390 cases died. The ones that were well in 3 days needed time to recover, but it seemed that they were only recovering from an extreme case of weakness. Unfortunately, this doctor’s name is one name that I must keep confidential. But, you can see that he had very good results, as all of these patients were slated to die within weeks of being released from the Kampala hospital. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Uganda, East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 72 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I did not find it hard to believe his reports as he had no reason to lie to me on a constant basis day after day as I was paying him nothing nor even sending him free MMS (I left 40 bo ttles there). I have been able to treat a number of AIDS patients successfully myself. My friend in Malawi, who runs a business there, has been treating several employees who were too sick from AIDS infec tion to come to work. They are now all back to work. The owner of the clinic was also th e pastor of a lo cal church. His church was a member of the FCF Int. Missionary group to Africa. It turned out that he had a problem very similar to the other Pastor in Kenya. Solomon Mwsegi was also taking pain tablets for the pain caused by malaria. Both he and his wife were avoiding the idea that they had malaria. The pain tablets will often mask the malaria, not very well but they keep yo u going. To go on taking them is extremely dangerous as the malaria can kill you without you mu ch feeling it. Actually when I asked him about it, he said, “I know its malaria. I’ve just been putting off doing anything about it.” He said, “I’ll take a double dose right now.” I asked if he was sure, mentioning that it was going to make him nauseous. He said, “I know it is, but I want to get it over and I want to be sure the malari a is killed.” He had been watching carefully what we were doing and how I was re-adjusting the number of drops. So he took the double dos e (of course, with the vinegar activator and the standard three minute wait.) He later told me that he wanted the drops to make him sick as he felt that would be proof that something was really working in his body. Here is word for word what I wrote in my notes at the time: “Within 20 minutes he was nauseous. Within an hour he could not drive the car. He had diarrhea. At home he felt to tally tired like he didn’t want to move except to go to the toilet. It started at about 11 AM that morning and at 4 PM when we got home he was better. At 8 PM he was up lying of the couch. He said all sickness was gone, but he was feeling weak. The next morning he was slightly dizzy but feeling good otherwise.” From the beginning to th e end of this ordeal, he was very enthusiastic about it. When he got sick, he was enthusiastic because he believed the MMS was working. When it was over, the next day he said he couldn’t believe how well he was feeling."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Uganda, East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 73 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century His wife was watching the whole ordeal and she was very worried, but she was also afraid of doing nothing because she was well aware that her pain tablets were also masking malaria. When she proceeded to take the dose, her husband (Solomon) stayed with her. She was not as nauseous as Solomon had been, but she stayed sick for most of the second day. Finally, however, she was extremely happy about how well she was feeling. She said it wa s the first day in over a year that she felt like herself. Evidently, wh en malaria is masked with pain tablets, it gets very bad and th us the MMS was extra reactive. However, they could have avoided the reaction simply by taking a few days using smaller doses instead of trying to do it all at once. The problem was that they were always extremely busy and didn’t feel that they could afford the extra time. It didn’t seem to matter who I was involved with while I was in Africa; the people were willing to trust me. I think that they could feel or that they knew that I would not do anyt hing that was against their better interests. The time spent at Solo mon’s clinic was very productive in learning more of the ins and outs of the MMS. My driver, Peter Mwangi drove to Kampala and arrived a day later than me. Solomon also furnished him a room in his house. Peter was a great help in the clinic. He helped me mix MMS doses. He took pictures and he learned as much data as he could about the MMS. Several months later, Solomon accused Peter of raping one of his servant girls. The girl was pregnant. Peter said that it was impossible. He didn’t do any such thing. It seems like, since I was in the same house, that I would have heard so me kind of noise, or would have noticed the girl crying or somethi ng. But I did not hear anything. I observed only a very high integrity fr om Peter while I was there, so I rather believe Peter when he says th at he didn’t do it. The thing that seemed kind of peculiar to me was that Solomon continued to fire person after person from his clinic ev en while I was there. I worked with the people that he fired and they all seemed to be doing a good job. I never understood why he fired any of them, so when he stated that Peter had raped his servant girl , I question that accusation in my own mind, but I did not interfere with Solomon’s operation of the clinic. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Uganda, East Africa  Chapter 6  Page 74 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century In any case, we treated over 500 pe ople while I was there. Solomon asked me to help and to remain pr esent because those people who came were expecting a white man. The people there had a great deal more confidence in the MMS because a white man was helping them. Even when I quit giving the solution to people, they were much more confident when I was simply present. Solomon promised that a white man would be there and the people who came were much more confident even if I only stood outside on the front porch.

I sent ema ils to the president of the U.S., to Bill Gates, to various people who did humanitarian things, to all of the TV shows that did humanitarian things, such as Oprah. I continued to send out free bottles of MMS as well as I sold the 4 ounc e bottles with 325 doses for $20 each or for $5 to anyone living in town. Later when I doubled the strength, I sold the 4 ounce bottles with 450 doses for the same price. As time passed, people talked to me about various problems I continued to find new uses for the MMS. All of my life I have had trouble with my teeth. Most of my teeth were missi ng and I wore dentures. My gums were quite soft and my teeth were somewhat loose in the gums. They often got sore and at that particular time they started to hurt and I thought I would have to have one or two pu lled. Then I finally decided that I should brush my teeth with the MMS. I used 6 drops of MMS and 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar swirled together in a glass and then I waited the 3 minutes and added 1/3 glass of water and used that to brush my teeth. Again I was amazed. All of the infection and soreness disappeared in hours. Within a week my gums had hardened up. When I finally did go to have a tooth pulled, it took the dentist a full hour to pull the tooth. My gums were so tough and the tooth was so well imbedded into my jaw bone he simply couldn’t just grab it w ith his pliers and pu ll. It wouldn’t come out. I’m not sure I should have had it pulled. It looked perfectly healthy when it was finally out. The dentist was more surprised than I was. Since that time there have been a nu mber of other people who began to use the MMS for oral hygiene. All th at have used it have had the same results, a much healthier mouth. Th ere have been a number of people who were able to fix their abscessed teeth merely by brushing with MMS. I am sure Arnold was working hard to get the money for our next trip to Africa. My contention was always th at if he would provide me with"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 78 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century enough money for a round trip airplane ticket and some living expenses then I would travel anywhere. I w ould talk to the various government agencies and hospitals until I found some place to do clinical trials. Arnold’s contention was that we coul d not go anywhere in Africa until we had an invitation. According to Arnold there was always plenty of money but his insistence that we need ed an invitation kept us immobile for years. Peter Mwangi secured an invitation from one hospital in Kenya to go do clinical trials in Kenya. Remember, Peter was my driver in Kenya and Uganda who I trained in dispensing the MMS. We could have done the clinical trials of 100 ma laria patients with before and after blood tests for less than $20,000 including my travel expenses. The money was available, but Arnold woul d not allow me to go to Kenya. Instead, he wanted to help Floyd Ha mmer and his wife who had various projects going on in Tanzania but who could not get clinical trials for months. It finally proved out that he never did get clinical trials. A clinical trial was what we wanted at the time. We could have had it through Peter, but we were going to do it Arnold’s way regardless of the results. Time after time for over a year, Floyd Hammer was provided money from our Malaria Solution Founda tion and he never gave us any information back as to its use. We helped them buy a pickup truck and shipped a large container of food supplies to Tanzania. When Floyd wrote a report to his people in the U.S. he never acknowledged that we helped at all. He talked about treating malaria patients, but he never acknowledged that he was using the MMS to treat the patients. Finally Arnold just said that he wasn’t going to send them any more money. But if I could have had that same money, I would have completed the clinical trials in Kenya and would have ha d the proof that everyone was asking for. I continued to very discreetly say that giving Floyd money was not helping but it took over a year before Arnold would listen. The other thing that I tried to get Arnold to do was simply hire Peter Mwangi, my driver who was proficient with the dispensation to continue treating and passing out the MMS. He was traveling to hospitals which were willing to try the MMS. He c ould have been traveling to churches, orphanages, hospitals, a nd clinics. They trus ted him and many were willing to use the solution. In the same amount of time that we fooled around with Floyd, Peter would have helped thousands of people and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 79 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century dozens of places would have used the MMS. Unfortunately, nothing I suggested was considered. Hiring Pete r, a local instead of someone from the U.S., would have been ridiculous ly cheap. We would not have had to pay for his airplane ticket; he wo uld have worked for less than $100 a month. We would have had to pa y for gasoline, some operating expenses, and have shipped him plen ty of MMS. His expenses were 1/10 that of a foreigner or missionary. He would have gotten done exactly what we wanted to do. Arnold didn’t trust Peter but he never met him. I worked with him every day for an en tire month. We were good friends by the time I left. On the other ha nd, Floyd took our money, which was thousands and didn’t even say than ks. The money we paid Floyd got absolutely nothing done so far as we could tell. Arnold kept making mistake after mist ake while all the time saying that everything had to be done his way. He hired the kid who finally made such trouble for us that he prevented us from getting a legal nonprofit Malaria Solution Foundation. Arnold hired several people to create our Web Site. After they had worked almost a year on it, it was still a very poor site. Then he hired another ma n to do our site, paid him up front and never got a thing for his money. All the while our site never got done. It has been six years since Ar nold said he was going to get a web site set up. As I write these lines we still don’t have one. He sent thousands of dollars to Floyd Hammer and we never received any acknowledgment or data concerning the malaria people helped with our MMS. With the money Arnold conti nued to lose, I could have had a number of clinical trials complete d in Kenya with the proof that we needed to show others. Even thoug h he flunked again, he continued to adamantly insist that everything must be done his way. He continued to claim that the people who were going to sponsor us would only do so if he was in total control. Arnold actually prevented the MMS from being used distributed while all the time proclaiming to be getting it done. Arnold continued to tell me that although I was on the board of the Malaria Solution Foundation it wa s going to be operated like a corporation. Basically, he said that he was the president and things were going to happen the way he specified . Arnold and John continued to say that I had no say in the way thin gs were being run. There was no arguing with either one of them. If there was any discussion about the events of the past week s or past year, they wo uld both get together and tell me my memory was wrong. When there was any discussion and I"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 80 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century tried to say something they would just start shouting. I could not get any ideas across. Everything went quietly so long as I kept my mouth shut. I could have left, and I should have, bu t there was always the promise that they would have the money to get to Africa to prove out the MMS so that the world would accept it. I ke pt my mouth shut because that promise always hung there in front of me . To be completely fair, when I finally returned from Africa the last time, Arnold called me with several questions concerning how to do things. He stated he wanted my input, but as things continued he would do things as he wanted regardless of my input. Up to this point, Arnold had been the only game in town for me. Then I realized I could write this book. I made a contract with the World Health Organization (WHO). Before my trip to Kenya and Uganda I had written quite a few letters to the World Health Organization which, evidently, didn’t want to appear like they were not interested. They returned one of my letters saying that they had a program in which they te sted various drugs that might have some effect on malaria. They were in terested in the MMS, they wrote. After some discussion they sent me a contract to sign. We negotiated a bit, changed some points, and I finall y signed their contract. I sent them a bottle of the MMS. About a year and a half later, after I returned from Africa, I finally got a letter from them stating that they were testing my solution in a separate lab. They ha d contracted with a doctor to do the testing for them. I was enthused to learn that the doctor was actually of doing the testing. But he tested it on mice and reported it simply didn’t work. I was amazed, but he reported th at it wouldn’t cure mice or even improve their condition. There was not hing more I could say as I wasn’t present when the testing was done. So at that time 35,000 human field patients were back to health, but it wouldn’t cure a mouse? Sorry, but I don’t believe him. There is a country in Africa that w on’t even allow WHO to come across its borders. It seems to me that WHO, if they were really interested in helping the world as they claim to be, would have at least given the MMS a comprehensive test. That’s especially true after they were informed of the successes in Kenya and Uganda. At that time over 35,000 people had been successfully trea ted in the field, based on reports that said that everyone went away feeling good. I also informed the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 81 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century doctor of our field work but he was not interested. Had they been even slightly interested they would have in vited me over to help them with the testing. The doctor doing the testing didn’t have the slightest idea what the MMS is about. He didn’t unders tand it. He didn’t understand the vinegar activation and he didn’t underst and what the chemicals were. He didn’t want to know. He preferred to use my solution without knowing what it was. My evaluation of his disi nterest is that he just wanted to prove it didn’t work and that was that. Let me say it again, he was absolutely totally disinterested in the fact that 35,000 malaria patients had been successfully treated in the fi eld. I talked to him at length on the phone, but again, he showed total di sinterest. Obviously, all WHO wanted was a doctor’s signature that said that the MMS didn’t work. There was also a doctor in Israel who also tested MMS, and said it wouldn’t work. But guess what, he refu sed to use vinegar to activate the MMS. He said that acetate was the sa me thing so he used only acetate. Well the fact is that acetate is not th e same thing as vinegar. Chemically it’s totally different, but he simply would not use vinegar as he obviously believed he knew best. I thought you might like to see the cont ract that I had with WHO. The contract is several page s long and there really is n’t enough room here to show it, but they (WHO) sent a lette r along with the contract. I have included that letter on the next page. If you are really interested in seeing the contract just write me and I will send you a copy of the contract. You could even come by my place and view the actual contract.

He said that I could not give any more away . We went through that same thing from time to time. He wanted us to keep control of every bottle. I am sure, from Arnold’s point of view; he believes that he was the man who got everything in Africa going. He c ontinued to meet people and groups that just might finance us to go to Af rica. I continue to live out here on the desert and Arnold continued to not allow me to meet any of the people who might finance us in Afri ca. I wrote this paragraph today simply because I gave two local pe ople one bottle of MMS each. Arnold found out and there was a long discu ssion about how I might go to jail because of it. Today I just got a call from Arnold as he was leaving San Francisco after talking to one more prospective donor, another one he would not let me meet. Out here in the desert, only writing emails to Africa, I was able to get help for over 5,000 people with malaria since March of 2004 by making friends in Africa. Arnold had done nothing during this time except talk about what he is going to do in Africa. Nothing had happened. According to him, he had unlimited money (at least in the millions) to handle Africa and I had just my Social Security check. One day in the desert, about one ye ar after coming back from Uganda, while working on the roof I fell off and broke my neck. I was rushed to the hospital in the nearby city, but they didn’t have the necessary equipment so they flew me by airplane to Reno. Finally, they opened my neck up and put a titanium screw into the 2nd cervical in my neck (the same bone that the actor who played Superman broke). You should see the screw. It looks like a 1-1/2 inch wood screw. I also broke my back at the same time. My back healed quite quickly but my neck refused to heal. The doctor left th e bones not quite touching. The screw should have had another 1/2 turn. Six months went by and still no healing. The doctor was insisting that he open my neck back up and put two more screws in place. The Veterans Hospital said that I must have another operation as well, but they ha d another idea of how to do it. However, they couldn’t get to it for another six months. I was left between a rock and a hard place or a broken neck."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 84 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Finally a friend in Canada, Michael Haynes, suggested that I look into magnetism. In my search of the Inte rnet I found a group of clinics that were using a new theory of magnetism and that the clinics were having really great results. The cost was very high. After getting as much evidence of the new technology and as much data on the old technology as I could find I bought some of the st rongest magnets now available. In fact, they are so strong that they are dangerous. They can squash a finger or cut it off when being handled improperly. The new technology works on the basic concept that magnetism must have a completed magnetic circuit through the body in order to get maximum healing power. During this time I continued to co mmunicate with as many people in Africa as I could plus sending emails to various organizations. With the magnets I bought; I constructed a steel curved piece that would allow for a completed magnetic circuit through my neck with the South Pole nearest the broken bone. I put the ma gnets in place for a total of five days and nights sitting up all night to make sure they were exactly in place. At the end of five days my neck began to swell up. I went back to the doctor and had another x-ray. The bone was completely healed. The doctor removed my neck brace. He said that I didn’t need it any more. He said he was glad that he deci ded to wait before giving me the operation. He didn’t remember that I was using magnets. He didn’t care and he wasn’t interested. In fact, he would have preferre d to give me the operation. He didn’t decide to wa it before giving me the operation. I didn’t get the operation because I refuse d it. If he had his way, I would have had the operation. I don’t know what all the magnetic ci rcuit does, but I do know that the extremely strong magnets cause the area to swell with blood and turn red. No doubt the extra blood aids in the healing. The x-rays before and after proved that the bones healed in the five days that I kept the magnets in place. I was mainly relieved that if the opportunity came to return to Africa, my neck was healed and I could go. If you have problems with getting b ones to heal, look into the magnetic side of healing bones. As time passed, a man from Guinea calle d; he wanted us to go to that country to help the people there. He said that he was a friend of the first"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 85 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century lady and that he could get us approv ed by the government. He had told the first lady about us, they were a nxious for us to come to Guinea. Arnold finally took me to meet him so we talked. Things were being set for us to go. I called this man from Guinea and then a ll hell broke loose as Arnold told me that I was never to talk to this man again. He would never allow me to talk to anyone that he considered his contact. There was the hollering and screaming that I so hate and cannot take part in. As things turned out, this man decide d he was going to dictate the terms of our every move in Guinea, whic h it was simply something that we could not accept. At least that is wh at Arnold told me. So we didn’t go to Guinea. I can’t tell y ou how humiliating it is to be told that you can’t even talk to someone. The date at this time was the first part of 2005. Chino goes to Sierra Leone West Africa A very active young fellow by the name of Chino contacted me and stated that he would like to know more about the MMS (We were calling it the Malaria Solution at that time). I met Chino in Beatty, Nevada, about March 2005. I explained how the MMS worked, mixed some doses and had him take it. Chino explained that his family in Sierra Leone owned a large gold mining concession along the main rive r there. He explained that the malaria was so bad that everyone in his family had malaria. Many people there had died of malaria. He said that he needed as much of the MMS as I could furnish him. I said I would try to get him as much as possible. We had decided to charge a price that any African could afford at that time, which was about 10 cents. I expl ained the price and he said that he could get the money. I furnished him with 20 bottles at that time which could treat about 200 persons per bottle or a few more because more than ½ people treated were child ren. I gave them to him free of charge, but he insisted that he woul d pay in the near future. About two months later he visited me in the desert. He had been to Sierra Leone and treated about 1,000 pe ople in the village and the area where his family lived. He said that more people were there waiting for him to bring more bottles of the MMS. He explained that it was not possible to charge anything for the MMS that he gave the people. He said that the minute he began sellin g doses for any amount of money, the government would come, take the m oney, and the MMS.

The government wants all the money and all the business. If you give the stuff aw ay, there is no money in it and the government is not interest ed. The only way to ma ke it work is bring it into the country and give it away without charge. Picture: Chino’s relatives in Sierra Leone help him with hundreds of people. The plastic glasses each hold a dose of MMS .  Otherwise the government will take it and sell it only to those who can pay large sums for the treatment. Hi s assessment of the situation was that to furnish it for freely was the only way that the people of Sierra Leone would ever get the MMS. But he said that he had people in the U.S. who would furnish the money. I didn’t ask him for money even though he kept saying that he would pay."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 87 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Picture: People line up to take a dose of MMS in Sierra Leone. Notice how closely they stand to one another. This was Chino’s operation. I put together 100 bottles with 450 doses each. Then Chino and I traveled to Reno and shipped the bottles to Sierra Leone. He paid for the shipping with a credit card. I asked fo r no money only that he give us a signed letter from each person that was treated and helped who had malaria. He then left to go back to Sierra Leone to begin helping more people. He later returned from Sie rra Leone after help ing an additional 5,000 malaria victims. This trip t ook about three months. He had a camera and his cousin took a number of pictures of the people during the process. When he returned he did not have any letters signed, but he did have the pictures. Later he asked for more bottles. We never refused any of his requests for bottle s even though he did not bring the signed letters. I have included pictures of his work in Sierra Leone. John continued to talk about furnishing the money for us to go to Africa. Arnold said we couldn’t go until we had an invita tion. Because they had money and kept talking about financi ng a trip to Afri ca to do clinical trials done, I kept quiet. They relie d on my desire to see the people of Africa helped. Thus, they could take my technology, allow me no say at all, and pay me nothing but expenses for the trip, which of course, was really nothing. They assured the sponsors that no one (me) would be receiving payment for the technology. They said that the sponsors wanted all of their money to go to ward helping people in Africa. I couldn’t really argue agains t that. How could I be so selfish as to want"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Continuing Story of the MMS Chapter 7 Page 88 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century some return for my technology? Th e fact is though; I never knew who the “sponsors” were. I finally realized that although they were ensuri ng that the money went towards treating people in Africa, they were also using my technology to become known in the country of Ma lawi. They were then working towards several different business ve ntures there including mining and a new rice technology that would furnish rice protein worldwide. I’m not included in any of that. I don’t want to be. I figure that if I continue to attempt to get this MMS information to the world, money will eventually come my way. If not, at least I know that this data is too important to have it under the control of any one person. I am not going to allow that to happen. I will see th at it is published to the widest audience that is within my ability to reach. Picture: Chino on the left, gives MMS to a boy that is in this case somewhat reluctant to take it.

His name is Zahir Shaikh. He is a great human itarian. Once he learned about us, he wanted to help his people. So w ith his invitation a nd money that John furnished, Arnold and I flew to Mala wi in February of 2006, along with two other people that Arnol d wanted to bring along. Picture: From left to right, James Christiansen, Jim Humble (author), Zahir Shaikh and John Wyaux. On the night before we left for Malawi, we were having a farewell dinner. John said to me, but with everyone listening, “I just want you to know that you have to do everything exactly how Arnold wants it, or there will be no money to finance you in Malawi. You are a loose cannon and we can’t have you screwing things up.” I simply replied, “All right, I’ll do it Arnold’s way.” Talk about “off the wall,” everything was already being done Arnold’s way. They had already insured that I"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 90 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century had no say. It had been told to me again and again. John just had to get this one last dig in for no appare nt reason so far as I could see. There were many things that were not going to work Arnold’s way, but he would have to see it for himsel f as we went along. He certainly wasn’t going to listen to me. I wanted to walk out on the whole thing. It’s not a way I enjoy being treated, but we were slated to be help ing sick people in Malawi and I just couldn’t walk out. (The fact is, if I had walked out, the mission would have failed). Yes, it was John’s mone y that was making it possible, but it was also my years of work pushing th e idea and my technology that also made it possible. I had no idea that they considered me a loose cannon, as I had agreed to their demands. When I returned a little over a month later, John apologized because his gi rlfriend said he should, but that didn’t really change an ything. Money people have a tendency to not respect people without money. Money, however, was never my thing. I spent 50 years and hundreds of thousa nds of dollars studying spiritual philosophies and religions. I have something John and Arnold will never have and will never understand. My spiritual studies had enabled me to be sufficiently receptive to new po ssibilities so I could discover the MMS in the first place. Zahir Sheikh (see picture) is the businessman who invited us to Malawi. He is an East Indian whose ancestors moved to Malawi many years ago. He took us all around the capitol of Malawi to many government offices helping us get approval for the MMS (which we called at that time the Malaria Solution). Our success in getting the MMS accepted in Malawi was completely orchestrated by Zahi r. Every day he would take us around the city in his automobile to visit various officials such as the Chief of Police, the Inspector Genera l, the Health Minister, and so on."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 91 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century When we visited the office of each official, Zahir would introduce us, Arnold would talk about our mission to bring the MMS to Africa, then he would suggest that I tell them the details of how the MMS really works. At that time I would spend 10 to 20 minutes explaining the basic chemistry of the MMS. The time I took was mostly determined by how many questions that they asked. I thought this was particularly interesting because before we left on the trip, Arnold was extremely adamant that we should not tell anyone in Malawi about how the solution worked. That was one of the reasons they called me a loose cannon. I tried to point out that our program would not be workable if we didn’t tell people how the MMS worked. That was one of the main points of contention. Picture: Three of the prison nurses watch as the Author shows them how to mix the MMS. I was forbidden to tell them how it wo rked, but to the very first person we went to see, Arnold said, “This is the inventor and he will tell you how it works.” So for months Arnold was stuck on not explaining how it works. But when we were actually there, Arnold immediately saw that we would have to tell them the de tails. This was one of the many"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 92 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century examples that were used to show me that Arnold must have complete control. I didn’t really push the point, because I knew that the doctors and the scientifically trained officials wo uld never allow us to do anything without an explanation of how it work ed. At one point Arnold even said to me, “If you start telling them ho w it works, I will take you down to the airplane and send you home.” (That was when we were talking about going to Guinea). Another point of disagreement was Arnold’s insistence that we should not be the ones to administer the MMS that we should only train the people there and then let them give th e MMS to the malaria victims. But that simply wasn’t practical. I didn ’t push that point either as I knew Arnold would have to change when he got there. When you bring a solution, you had better be prepared to give it to the people. If you don’t, no one will trust in your solution either! As it turned out, we always gave the doses. Arnold was smart enough to see that it had to be that way. To hand the solution to a local and say, “Here you give it” just doesn’t work in Africa. They conclude you are afraid to give your own solution. So as the inventor, when we arrived at different places, I made sure we gave the doses and Arnold quickly saw the advantage. When we went to see an official, I generally would mix doses for everyone including the officials, and believe it or not, every official we saw was willing to drink some. So the very first thing we did in Malawi was to personally give people their doses of the MMS. Then when we finally got out to the prisons or other places, again we were the ones to dispense the doses. In the entire time we were there, I do not believe that we had a single Malawian dispense the doses. Basically, everything went the way I said it would go, but there was no recognition of that. Rather there was just increased determination for everyt hing to go the way Arnold dictated. Things do change rapidly there. When they see that you are willing to give the solution and that it works, th en they begin to ask to be allowed to handle the solution and the situation. One must not show in any way that he is hesitant about dispensing the solution. "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 93 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century While we were in Malawi, Arnold fi red the two other people that he brought with us. One was a photogra pher named James Hackbarth and the other, a friend of Arnold’s, na med John Wyaux. I won’t tell all the details, just the highlights. The most embarrassing part happened in probably the most exclusive restaura nt in town. Everyone had on suits and ties and we were the only white people there. Arnold stood up and shouted at John Wyaux. I never rea lly knew why. The whole restaurant went deathly silent when Arnold began to shout. I just sat there looking at my plate, too embarrassed to look up. Finally being so angry, Arnold stomped out of the restaurant, and thi ngs settled back dow n to the normal murmur of conversation. I found out the next day that John had said something to Zahir, our businessman helper, but Zahir never heard what was said. I didn’t hear what was said either. In fact, no one but Arnold heard what was said, not even John knew what he had said that set Arnold off. To this day, I don’t know what John said, thus I still have no idea why he was fired. Three evenings later, Arnold was sli ghtly under the influence of alcohol. He entered James Hackbarth’s room and fired him because he wasn’t taking the right type of pictures, a ccording to Arnold. I admit I didn’t like some of his pictures, but I fi gured all we had to do was explain exactly what we wanted. In any case after that, Arnold told both of them that they could get home the best they could. During the few days they had left, Arnold was extremely rude to them anytime he saw them. Perhaps I should have gone home with them, as no one deserves that kind of treatment, but I wanted the Ma lawi project to succeed so badly that I was able to compromise my integrity concerning the treatment of my acquaintances. All of my decisi ons and choices were then, and still are predicated, on the idea that I wa nt the MMS to be in use widely throughout the world. We had the same problem in Malawi that we had in Kenya. The initial doses that I mixed were too weak. Wh en we were first helping prisoners in our clinical trials at the prison, they were coming back the next day, feeling better but not totally well. So I began increasing the doses. There was one other problem. We were purchasing juice that had vitamin C added as a preservative. The added vitamin C reduces the effectiveness of the MMS by about 75%. I had alrea dy proven this fact, but I let it slip by me at first as I had never had a real problem with it before. Once I"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 94 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century realized that vitamin C was present in the purchased juice, I started using only fresh juice and also increased th e dosage. Then we began to get a 100% recovery rate from malaria. Picture: Two female prison inmates give their babies the MMS formula. Both babies were okay in 24 hours. Someone had suggested that doing clin ical trials in the local prisons would be the easiest thing to do and the easiest place to get permission. We decided to give it a try. We vi sited the local prison by the name of Maula in the city of Lilongwe, whic h is the capital of Malawi. The manager of the prison gave us pe rmission to talk to the medical technician. The assistant medical tec hnician’s name was S.S. Kamanja. Although he was the assistant, he wa s always the only one there. He arranged for us to do the clinical tria ls. We slipped him a few dollars at several different times and he was quite cooperative. Actu ally, it is only fair to mention that he was quite cooperative even before we slipped him a few dollars, but he was such a ni ce man that we thought it would be nice to help him out a bit. We then left the prison to find a lab or hospital that would be able to process blood samples. It was esp ecially important that they be a separate organization. We finally settled on a medical hospital called MARS which was an international organization. MARS stands for Medical Air Rescue Service. Dr. Joseph Aryee was the head man there and he was very responsive to us. We explained what we wanted to do and what our MMS actually did. We mixed our normal drink to show him. He went ahead and drank the mi xture as did most other officials in Malawi. He assigned us a medical la b technician whose name was Paul"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 95 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Makaula. Dr. Aryee said that all we would need to do would be to pay Paul’s salary while he was working for us. We agreed on $300 U.S. for six days, plus we agreed to pay hi s gasoline and other expenses. Dr. Aryee allowed the medical lab technician to use the MARS lab and microscope for the blood tests from at the prison at no charge, which we thought was very generous. He wanted to be of some help. Throughout the country of Malawi the officials all drank a full dose of the MMS. If it had been a drug they probably would not have taken it. If they were not willing to take the MMS, which is merely a mineral supplement, then they would not be w illing to have their people take it. In my opinion, these officials were very courageous to assist us to help their people. They were willing to take the doses of MMS just on our say so. It is my belief that the reason the Pharmaceutical Medicines and Poisons Board so readily accepted our MMS as a mineral supplement rather than a drug, was that so many officials dr ank it without hesitation when we told them that it was not a drug. In essence many people really wanted to see the MMS help their c ountry. They wanted it to work and they were willing to cooperate in order to have it work for them. Back at the prison the next morning, S.S. Kamanja brought in the first 10 men. They were given six drops ea ch, with ¼ teaspoon of vinegar, the three minute wait, and then pineapple juice was then added. Arnold checked each patient for temperature. The first thing we learned was that those ear thermometers simply do not work in Africa. I think it is because ears in Africa, especially in prison, are cleaned differently, or not at all. Luckily we had the plas tic strip thermometers that you just press on the forehead. Within about 10 seconds the temperature can be read in the plastic. Finally Arnold was using the strip thermometers on everyone he checked. The strip ther mometer worked well and we were able to get the temperature of each patient which was generally quite high. Paul, the lab technician, st uck each patient’s finger and took a blood sample and put it on a slide with the patient’s name. These slides were then taken back to the MARS laboratory and Paul checked each one on the microscope. We carefully recorded the data from the 10 patients that morning after taking th e blood samples. Then I mixed the doses in plastic cups and Arnold handed the cup to each patient."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 96 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century When we had finished taking blood samples, recording the data, and after giving each of the 10 patients a dose we asked if there were any more prisoners complaining of malaria. Kamanja said that there were 19 more. We said, “Bring them all in and we will dose all of them,” which is what we did. We returned that afternoon after 3:00 p.m. to see the results but they were not so great. Mo st said they were feeling better, but they all still had fevers. The fever had been reduced in only one man. I knew something was wrong. We dose d everyone again including the 10 actually being tested and the other 19 that were just receiving a dose without taking blood samples or havi ng records kept. We again used only six drops. You probably guessed it, the next morn ing everyone still tested positive for malaria. It was then I began to remember that in Kenya I had been using 15 drops. We only used six drops in the U.S. for maintenance. I began to get an inkling of what was going wrong. I also remembered the experiments proving that vitamin C reduced the effectiveness of the chlorine dioxide. I began working that evening at getting the correct juice without vitamin C added. The Malawi prisons are much like c oncentration camps. The prison is closed in by with only a wire fence w ith barbed wire at the top. There are armed guards at the corners of the pr ison in small guard shacks. While we were there, they asked us if we would like to see the women’s quarters. Of course, we said yes. The women sleep on the bare floor with only a blanket or two. Arnold sa id that he would get the women a foam mattress to sleep on. Women who have children have the children stay with them in the prison. The gu ards get most of the food slated for the prison and sell it elsewhere. Therefore, the inmates have very little to eat. They do raise a few vegetables like potatoes. There is a single toilet for the entire women’s dor m with water continuously running down the toilet. Aside from the bare floors, the prison stays fairly clean. The women bathe outside under a water faucet out of the sight of the men."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 97 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Picture: Shows 5 pads where the female inmates sleep. Children also stay here with their mothers. There was one man in the prison that had a high fever, but his blood test came back negative (meaning no malari a present). Since he seemed to have malaria symptoms, we suspected he may have been faking it. However, when we gave him the MMS, his temperature came down to normal overnight and his symptoms di sappeared. Paul, the lab man, said that he checked the blood a second time, but no malaria parasites were present. In any case, he got well even if it wasn’t malaria. There was also one prisoner who refused treatment. But since he was there, we recorded his name and temperature anyw ay. Several days later, when he saw all of the other prisoners getting well and he was still sick, he decided that he wanted to be treate d also. So, we went ahead and dosed him and he was okay the next day. I finally realized that the pineapple juice from the grocery store had vitamin C as a preservative. As I mentioned before, Vitamin C prevents the MMS from generating the chlorine dioxide that is necessary. We bought pineapples and a juice maker and made our own juice. In addition to using fresh juice we increa sed the dose to 18 drops. The next morning, before using the 18 drop doses, we again checked the patients. Of the 10 from which we had origin ally taken blood samples, the one man that did not test positive for malaria was feeling okay. The other nine again said that they were feeling better, but not well. A second blood test was done. This test showed that the malaria parasites were still present but the parasites looked di storted in several cases. We then dosed everyone with 18 drops and us ed the fresh pineapple juice. We"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 98 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century also dispensed the same 18-drop dose to the 19 additional prisoners with malaria. The blood tests that our lab man took the next morning all came back negative and all patients reported they were feeling good. The other 19 also reported feeling good, as well. We then selected another 10 cases to check. We had Paul, the lab man, ta ke their blood. We treated them with 18 drops of MMS and used the fr esh pineapple juice in their doses. Arnold was very helpful and assisted in everyt hing. He handed out the doses to the patients and took their te mperatures while I mixed the doses and recorded the information. The ne xt morning, (24 hours later) their blood all tested negative for malaria. In addition, all of the “old” patients that we treated in the prison were still feeling well. I had learned in Uganda that the sure way to completely destroy the malaria parasite was to use two doses of 15 drops each, separated by one to four hours. If that had been th e way we had started out, there would never have been any trouble here. I have to plead being old with a poor memory. Two years had passed si nce the treatments in Uganda. I simply had forgotten the details and had to learn them over again. In the U.S. we usually just use six drop do ses for maintenance, but we often need to go above six drops to overcome some problems. I had forgotten that we were doing two 15 drop doses in Uganda. I’ll never make that mistake again and hopefully someone sm arter than me will be doing it next time anyway. At the end of the prison tests, Dr. Aryee at the MARS hospital reviewed Paul’s lab blood tests and gave us a very positive letter. The fact was, that every patient that originally tested positive for malaria in the blood tested negative after MMS treatment and they were feeling fine. It took several extra doses for the first 10 tested, but all eventually tested negative. Let me say that again, all eventually tested negative, which made it 100% successful even if it did take an extra day to get the first group cured. While in Malawi we also visited several grass hut villages. There we helped with every kind of sickne ss you can imagine. We dosed the villagers as they came up to us te lling us what was wrong. We didn’t refuse a dose to anyone. Why not treat as many as we could, it’s only a"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 99 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century mineral supplement. Most of the pe ople in the village have one disease or another. Their water is not pure. The warm weather encourages all kinds of diseases. They walk with bare feet and the grass and streams have diseases that enter through the skin. The next day when we returned to the village most of the illness had been overcome. A number of people had vomited worms and some had dead worms in their stools. In the future, we hope to go back with enough solution so all of the villages can have what they need. Let me mention at this point that af ter Arnold fired the two people he had brought, he was very active in getting things done. He made things happen. I was pretty much just along for the ride at th at point. I had no say in how things were done. Arnold dictated everything and he made it work. So I helped at the prison and made suggestions to Arnold. I carried the technical side of things. But Arnold controlle d all phases of the operation. I really di dn’t need to be there except to figure out why the solution hadn’t initially worked and then make the necessary adjustments. The fact is, Arnold made the whole operation work and it was successful. Arnold asked me once, “How would you have done it differently?” Well, I would have done many things differently, simply because no two people do things the same way. But, he asked me if I disagreed with how he did things ...... well; I felt that there was no point in nitpicking. I would not have disagreed with anythi ng except with the way he fired the two guys who he brought along on the trip and the fact that he tried to keep such complete control of the bo ttles of MMS solution. At one of the villages I wanted to leave a bottle with the chief, but Arnold insisted that we would come back the next day to treat those who needed a second dose. But we never got ba ck, although I suggested it several times. Thus many went untreated, and in any sort of a situation where we didn’t keep our commitment it were upsetting to me. I hope you understand my purpose. I don’t just want to help some people in some villages. That is great to do and we enjoyed it, but my real purpose is to first prove out the MMS to the point that the world becomes willing to use it to help destroy many health problems in Africa including malaria and AIDS. When that happens, the world will need to spend less and less money on Afri ca. Right now, the world spends"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Malawi, East Africa Chapter 8  Page 100 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century untold billions of dollars in Africa. Malaria alone is the biggest cause of poverty in Africa. Each year 500, 000,000 people are sick with malaria and can’t work; millions more have AIDS and other problems. It also takes millions of other people to care for the sick. Everywhere you go in Africa you see nonprofit humanitarian gr oups working to help the people there. Billions and billio ns of dollars are being spen t in an effort to help Africa, but still it is n’t enough. This money will not be needed when these diseases are under control or ev en eradicated. Those billions of dollars can be allocated to other purposes. We accomplished a lot in Malawi. We got several agencies of the government to accept our MMS as a mineral supplement, which was important, but we treated less than 1 00 people while there. After we got the government acceptance and did a coupl e of 10-patient clinical trials, we went home. In actuality we did a to tal of three clinical trials. Finally, six months later we also found out that the clini cal trials conducted by the Malaria Board of the governme nt resulted in the same 100% recovery from malaria that our tests proved in the prison. There is the promise to treat the entire country, and I hope we do. Arnold did a very good job. He kept at it until we had our data. We however, did not come clos e to doing what we had come to do. We were supposed to spend a great deal of time in the villages training the chiefs and others to use the MMS. We only went to three villages in all. We did not train anyone in a single villag e to use the MMS. That was really what we were there for. We left, I assume because we were out of money, but I never knew why. I wanted to stay and do our job. It was merely told to me that we were going home, so we went home. Our original idea was to treat a few thousand people, but we went home after doing three clinical trials. We left Malawi for the U.S. on April 27, 2006. I again wound up out in the desert in Mina. Nothing has happen ed in Malawi since then, only lots of promises. I have been working fo r Arnold as the foreman of a crew of men fixing up his mill. It is a chance for me to make a few dollars while I am writing this book. John is financing most of the operation there at the mill. (This is not the same John that was fired in Malawi. This is a friend of Arnold’s that has been helping with finance for some time.)

They keep talking about returning to Africa, but it doesn't appear to me that it will happen any time soon because Arnold will have to be in charge of operations here or they will lose money. My single goal is to get the MMS to the world. So I have written this book. Up to this point Arnold still doesn’t allow me to talk to any of the new groups that he finds that are intere sted in helping our cause. I suppose that he believes that I am as bad with people as he is. Isn’t it normal for people to see faults in others that they themselves have? Things have changed. See the update paragraph below. I have a strong desire to see the en tire country of Malawi treated for malaria. Arnold and John continue to say that they will furnish the money, but Arnold does not trust me to go to Malawi alone and he is not ready to go, as I write this book. Howe ver, even if they do treat all of Malawi, and start on the next country, they still plan to keep the MMS solution a secret. They want to treat all of Africa while keeping it secret. I must see that the world gets th e complete information. Even if organizations and people throughout th e world know the secret of MMS, that should not prevent us or others from seeing that Africa is treated for all the problems that the MMS will handle. Hopefully, everyone will understand that. I have furnished as much information as I can in this book so that you, the reader, can save liv es. You really can; please try. To give a little update at this time (2008, March 1) more than 8000 books have been sold and over 11,000 bottles of MMS are being sold each month. Available MMS for you to purchase immediately . If you don’t want the hassle and you would like to try my exact formula, you can order it from my friends in Canada or other place s in the US where other people are manufacturing the MMS. At this time they all charge about the same price. Most are putting it in the same size bottl e which is a four ounce size bottle (it contains actually 5.5 ounces) for only $20 USD plus shipping which is small. So far they have kept the price down. I want everyone to be able to afford to be well without it being a financial worry to them. There are 450 six drop doses in this bottle. It should last you about one year.

Chlorine dioxide is a high explosive. Therefore, wherever it is used it must be generated on site. It cannot be transported as chlorine dioxide. It will instantly destroy any container that one might try to house it in. It cannot even be moved through meta l or plastic pipes. Numerous methods have been devised to gene rate chlorine dioxide and many different chlorine chemicals are used for that purpose. Chlorine dioxide is used for many industrial processes. It is used in paper mills to bleach the paper pulp white. It is used in cloth mills to bleach cloth. Probably the most important use is to purify water and thousands of water purification systems util ize chlorine dioxide th roughout the world. In water purification systems it is selective for pathogens and other bioorganisms that might be harmful to larger animals and humans. It does NOT combine with hundreds of constituents with which free chlorine will combine. Free chlori ne will combine with several items found in most water systems and will create carcinogenic compounds. Thus, although the initial cost of in stalling chlorine dioxide systems is higher, in the long run th e chlorine dioxide system s save money and they are much safer from a health standpoint. One of the most popular methods of generating chlorine dioxide is by various methods of treating sodium ch lorite. It is a white or slightly yellow flaky substance. Keep in mind that table salt is not quite the same thing. Note the spel ling of the last two letter s. Table salt is sodium chloride . We generate chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorite . Throughout the world today sodium ch lorite (the formula is NaClO 2 ) is probably used to generate chlorine dioxide more often than any other method. For the formula for chlorine dioxide we merely remove the Na which is sodium, and we have chlorine dioxide, ClO 2 . (Don’t worry; you don’t have to understand these formulas to understand the basics of what"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 9 Page 107 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century I am writing here.) There are possibly several dozen methods of using sodium chlorite to generate chlori ne dioxide. The FDA approves several methods of just adding swimming pool acid to a watery solution of sodium chlorite for the purpose of ma king chlorine dioxide which is used to sterilize chicken or beef before it is sold to the public. The acid generates the chlorine di oxide from the sodium chlorite. In many cases of sterilizing vegetables the chlorine does not have to be rinsed off as the chlorine dioxide soon turns into salt but not enough to make the vegetable salty. Amazingly enough, in a hundred thousand health food stores in the U.S. one can also find sodium chlorite in a watery form known as Stabilized Oxygen. In almost all cases Stabilized Oxygen is manufactured by simply adding 3.5% sodium chlorite by weight to distilled water, that’s 35,000 ppm. You can do it in your kitchen. Just don’t use any metal pots and pans, not even stainless stee l. Use only plastic or glass or Corning Ware. However, you will be much better off making the Miracle Mineral Supplement with my formula or buying it from someone who is using my formula. I’ll tell you exactly how to do that later in this book. For 80 years hundreds of thousands of people have put a few drops of Stabilized Oxygen into their water or juice and drank it down thinking that it somehow furnished extra oxygen to their bodies. The few that realized that some form of chlori ne was generated, mentioned it in passing, but still insisted that th e chlorite furnished the body with oxygen. Somehow during all those years, not one of the alternate medicine groups ever decided to have a good chemist look at the formula, or at least not one of them wrote about doing so. The fact is that simple chemistry shows us that no oxygen is generated that the body can use. Chlorine dioxide is a powerful chemi cal and it has many uses. It is an oxidizer, less powerful than oxygen, but with greater quantity available for oxidizing. Chlorine dioxide e xplodes when it contacts certain chemical conditions, and is neutral with other chemical conditions. It is selective. What do we mean when we say it explodes? Well, an explosion is merely a fast chemical reaction, mainly oxid ation that also releases energy . In the formula, ClO 2 , there are two oxygen ions. So"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 9 Page 108 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century why do these not get released these so that the body can use them? It’s because they have a minus two char ge. They have already done their oxidizing before they arrived in th is position. They cannot oxidize further. But the chlorine combin ed with oxygen can. When chlorine dioxide touches a pathogen or a pois on that is acidic in nature, it instantly accepts five electrons. It destroys anything that it can draw electrons from and generates heat at the same time (this action is called oxidation even when oxygen is not a part of it). The oxygen atoms are then released from the chlorine dioxide, but they are not elemental oxygen. They are ions of oxygen with a negative two charge. They are at the same charge as the oxygen in carbon dioxide, a gas that will kill you if you breathe enough of it. The carbon dioxide is not a poison. In other words it doesn’t do anything to the lungs; it is sort of like drowning. It prevents the lungs from getting the elemental oxygen that they need. Hydrogen and oxygen mix together become s water. That’s about all that the oxygen can do at this time. It beco mes water or it can become part of a carbon dioxide molecule. The ch lorine, after the explosion of oxidation, has also lost its charge and it becomes a chloride which is basically table salt, which again has no ability to oxidize as it no longer has any charge. There is nothing else left to cause any kind of a side effect. The basic idea is simply that oxygen a nd chlorine must be charged to the correct number of electrons, or they do not do the job of oxidizing. When oxygen is not capable of oxidi zing it simply cannot do the job in the body that is required for oxygen. What sodium chlorite really does for us is it gives us ch lorine dioxide, a chemical that is selectively to destroy almost all bad things that might exist in the body. Each tiny chlorine dioxide molecule has treme ndous power to dest roy those things from which it can draw electrons, but it does not have the power to draw electrons from healthy cells or aerobic bacteria. Chlorine dioxide does not last foreve r. It has too much energy bundled into a small area. It begins to lose some of its energy after a few minutes in the body and the same thing happen s when it is released into public water supplies. In the b ody when it has lost some of its energy so that it no longer is explosive (una ble to oxidize) it can th en combine with other"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Suppleme nt Chapter 9 Page 109 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century substances. There is some evidence that it helps make myeloperoxidase, a chemical that the body uses to ma ke hypochlorous acid that is then used by the immune system to furt her kill pathogens, killer cells, and other things. Chlorine dioxide is the only chemical known that has these qualities and that can do these things in the body wit hout creating side effects. In public water works or the bleaching of paper pulp in paper mills, the chlorine dioxide is generated on the site where it is used. In the body it is also generated on the site where it is used from sodium chlorite. How to Generate Chlorine Dioxide in the Human Body All of those people who used Stabili zed Oxygen for all those years didn’t realize the benefits were coming from the chlorine dioxide and thus no one ever tried to generate more of it. They believed that the millions of oxygen ions that were connected to th e chlorine were available to the body. Thus, they received the little be nefit that resulted from the fact that when a few drops of Stabilized Oxygen is added to water it begins to release chlorine dioxide, but very sl owly, too slowly to do much good. It releases a few chlorine dioxide ions per hour instead of per minute. There was always some benefit, but not nearly the full potential. For 80 years they missed it. So if we are going to generate chlo rine dioxide in the body, we need to do it about 1,000 times faster than wh at is now done when one adds a few drops of Stabilized Oxygen to a gl ass of water or juice. That gives you about 1 ppb (one part per billion) and what you really need is 1 ppm (one part per million), and often even more than that. In fact, sometimes it takes 1 ppt (one part per thous and). But don’t worry about those figures; one does not need to know all the technical deta ils to make it work. Just know that to cure AIDS it takes at least a thousand times more chlorine dioxide than Stabi lized Oxygen gives you, actually more like 10,000 times. As it was mentioned above the FDA authorizes adding swimming pool acid to solutions of sodium chlorite in order to generate chlorine dioxide. All of those public water purification plants that use sodium chlorite to make chlorine dioxide also use acid in various mechanical devices that add the acid at a pre established sp eed to a flow of watery sodium"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 110 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century chlorite. In the human body we ha ve a tougher problem because we want to add a lot of chlorine dioxide, but not all at once. We want to allow it to exist for a few hours so that it can be carried around to all parts of the body. But chlorine dioxid e deteriorates in minutes and will not exist in the body for hours if you just simply swallow some. There isn’t any mechanical mechanism that one can use to add acid slowly to a watery solution of sodium ch lorite inside the body. The Importance of Vinegar or Lime or lemon or Citric Acid That is where vinegar or lime or le mon comes in. The part that is important is the 5% acetic acid or the citric acid in lime or lemon. (Just recently, 7/1/2007, it has been discovered that pure citric acid works even better than vinegar, lime, or le mon.) When one of these items is added to sodium chlorite it causes the solution to begin releasing chlorine dioxide on a continuous basi s for about 12 hours. The addition of six drops of a solution that is 28% sodium chlorite (that’s the Miracle Mineral Supplement) to 30 drops of vi negar or lime or lemon will release approximately three mgs (3 milligrams) of chlorine dioxide in three minutes. That’s the reason for the three minute wait, but when you add water or apple juice to make about 1/2 glass of liquid the process slows down to one mg per hour. But thr ee mgs is quite a bit for the body. Thus these acids have a particular quality that works to create a continuous supply of chlorine dioxide for about 12 hours. In addition to creating the continuous rel ease of chlorine dioxide they also prevent the solution from releasing chlorine dioxide too quickly when the stomach acids mix with it. As the chlorine dioxide deteriorat es new chlorine dioxide is continuously being generate d in the body. Adding vinegar or lime or lemon to the sodium chlorite does the trick. If you don’t add one of these items, all you have is the same old Stabilized Oxygen health drink, which is interesting, but it really doesn’t get the job done. You can see from the above paragraph that the MMS starts off with three milligrams of chlorine dioxide and then continues to supply chlorine dioxide to the body for about 12 hours. The initial three milligrams is what the body needs. The MMS works best to destroy pathogens when 2 or 3 mg of free chlorine dioxide ar e in the solution at the time it is swallowed. It has an immediate effect . We have been talking all along"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 111 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century about six drops which is a mainte nance dose. If you are treating a disease 15 to 18 drops is a full do se. But read the instructions, you usually start off with small doses and work up. To give you an idea of what one milligram is, consider a standard U.S. dime. One gram is just about exactly 1/2 of a dime. Imagine 1/2 of dime cut into a thousand pieces. One of those pieces is one milligram. That’s less than a fly speck. That’s how powerful chlorine dioxide is. One milligram of chlorine dioxide begins killing pathogens in the body. Over a period of 12 hours the body will re ceive somewhere between 12 and 20 mgs, and there will be about two milligrams of chlorine dioxide distributed throughout the body at any one time, because as the chlorine dioxide is generated it is either used up by destroying pathogens or it deteriorates into other harmless chemicals in just minutes. When the chlorine dioxide degenerates, the fina l chemicals that are left are either chemicals that the immune system really needs, or the chlorine just turns to a chloride making a tiny insignificant amount of table salt and water. Because of this there simply can be no side effects. There is nothing left to cause side effects. Make no mistake. Chlorine dioxide ions are extremely powerful. They bundle tremendous energy into a small particle. But they only remain that way for a few minutes. They cont ain too much energy to last for a lengthy amount of time. In the world of submicroscopic energy particles, they are a torpedo with a selectiv e warhead. The chemical makeup of chlorine dioxide gives it that quality and no other chemical has that same quality. Some people have taken more than 20 times the amount of Stabilized Oxygen (sodium chlorite). Perfectly healthy people may have a small amount of nausea for 10 or 15 minutes from that large of a dose, but if they have any bad conditions in their body, depending upon what they are, they might get nauseous for a period. A few people including myself have tried 25 times the re commended MMS dose, and that will make you nauseous but it does not leave side effects. (This has already been tried and it would be extremely si ckening to try it.) The point is, chlorine dioxide is not only not harmfu l, but it is of great benefit to the body. Getting nauseous is the result of the chlorine dioxide attacking"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 112 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century some bad condition in the body. In the case of a liver condition such as hepatitis, one almost always gets nauseous. The reason for this is that the liver begins to expel the poisons as the chlorine dioxide begins to destroy them. But it also cure s the condition in record time. One lady with hepatitis C did just what I told he r not to do. Instead of taking two drops at first, she wanted to be certain that she killed it. She took 30 drops, added the vinegar, wa ited three minutes and added it to apple juice. It made her sick for th ree days. She then put the MMS aside and did not touch it for eight months. She thought because it made her so sick that it didn’t work, but wh en she finally decided to go to the doctor he could find no hepatitis in her body. Both were amazed. I have given it to many people with one of the hepatitis diseases A, B, or C. I can guarantee that 30 drops will make any hepatitis patient feel very sick, but it will also cure them. Howe ver, that is not the way to do it. A hepatitis patient should neve r start out with more th an two drops. In that case, normally they will not feel a ny nausea, and if th ey keep slowly increasing the drops until they can take 15 dr ops twice a day without nausea, they will check negative to hepatitis of all kinds. Procedure for Taking MMS for Maintenance Taking the MMS for longevity is importa nt. I wish I could say for sure that it will give you an additional 25 y ears of life. I can’t prove it yet, but I believe it. All the evidence poi nts to that conclu sion. Dozens of older people are taking the MMS. All those diseases that normally kill older people simply no longer have the sting. The immune system can be 100 times stronger than normal in older people and then pneumonia and flu and other disease just don’t get a foothold that is as long as one is taking the maintenance dose every day. Younger people can get by with taki ng the MMS maintenance dose two or three times a week, but older people n eed to take it at least once a day. When taking it once a day, every day, one can probably get by with taking four drop doses, and be sure to take it with the vinegar and three minute wait and then add the appl e juice (see below for exact instructions.) Anyone taking it two or three times a week should always take at least six drops for each dos e. Remember, hundreds of thousands of people have been taking this solution for 80 years; all I have done is"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 113 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century added a little food acid. No side eff ects have been repo rted in all these years, no side effects have been reported in the six years since the vinegar was added. Technically ther e should be none. It has been proven that chlorine dioxide does not at tack healthy cells. (That is in the small quantities used in MMS. A la rge quantity would kill anyone or anything). Remember how it was pointed out ear lier that the chlorine dioxide deteriorates into constituents that are totally nonpoisonous. Nothing is left behind to build up, as is the case in many c onventional medicines. The chlorine dioxide lasts long eno ugh to do its job, and then the part that does not furnish the immune system with needed ions becomes nothing but micro amounts of table sa lt and water. The chlorine dioxide has just a few minutes to do its thi ng and then it no longer exists. It leaves nothing behind that can build up. Initial procedure: Keep in mind that anyone taking the MMS for the first time should start out with no more than two drops for their first dose. The reason is that the two drops will not produce enough chemical reaction to cause bad nausea in those who have some sort of a health condition. If there is some really bad condition in the body, two drops could cause a mild nausea for ten minutes or so. In that case, continue to take only two drops daily or several times daily until there is no nausea. When one has reached the point where there is no nausea from two drops then use three drops the next time. Continue this until you are at 15 drops a day and then drop back to six drops a day. When using for treatment of some serious illness, you will need to progress until you are taking much more than six drops , depending upon the illness. Keep in mind, that when we refer to drops we always mean that one must add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of vinega r or lime or lem on or citric acid and then wait three minutes before addi ng 1/2 glass of juic e. That’s four ounces of juice for those of you who are more scientific. Without the vinegar or lime or lemon, the whole exercise consists of drinking a nice health drink. But nice health dr inks don’t do the job. And remember, DO NOT use juice with added vitamin C. "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 114 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century So the exact procedure is this: A dd two drops of MMS to a clean empty dry glass. Then add 10 drops of lime or lemon (if you use citric acid see the instructions in chapter 10). Swirl the glass by hand to mix the vinegar and drops. Wait three minutes. Add 1/2 glass of apple juice. Drink right away. You can substitute grape juice or pineapple juice as long as they are freshly made jui ces, meaning don’t buy juices with vitamin C added. Do not use orange ju ice. Orange juice prevents the production of chlorine dioxide. The reason for using fresh juice is that most juices have vitamin C added for a preservative. It makes the jui ce last longer and it is good for you, but it inhibits the release of chlori ne dioxide. It can even prevent you from getting the results that you want from taking the MMS. If you do use store bought juice make sure that it does not say that vitamin C has been added. If it does say vita min C added, you can always drink it several hours before or after taking the MMS. Allowing the drops and vinegar set more than three minutes is not necessarily a problem. The chlorine dioxide in the drops begins to separate and the chlorine goes off into the air and thus the concentrate of chlorine dioxide remains fairly constant for up to 1/2 hour, however tiny amounts of chlorine do remain in the solution. Putting a lid on the container makes the chlorine dioxide much stronger. Some people do this to make a stronger drink. The ve ry best practice is to not allow the drops and acid to go longer than three minutes before adding your juice and drinking it. To be sure of a strong drink of ch lorine dioxide, drink it immediately after adding the juice. (It’s not dangerous to allo w it to set longer, just not as effective). You can even let it set an hour or no more two. Juices that can be used are apple juice, grape juice, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice. AGAIN: Do not try to use orange ju ice. Orange juice prevents the production of chlorine dioxide and t hus prevents the MMS from being effective. "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 115 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Further Technical Stuff: This is just to further clarify some points made earlier. There are two levels of deteri oration that take place when we are talking about a dose of MMS solution. (1) The first thing that deteriorates is the Sodium Chlorite . After the vinegar is added, the Sodium Chlorite begins to deterior ate releasing Chlorine Dioxide into the solution. Chlorine Dioxide is an extremely powerful ion containing vast amounts of energy in an extremely small area. (2) It is not a stable condition to hold that much energy and it too begins to deteriorate. The Chlorine Dioxide ion reta ins its ability to dest roy pathogens, diseased cells, poisonous substances, and othe r harmful items for only about 30 minutes. It really begins to lose its energy within seconds of being released from the Sodium Chlorite, but it usually can do its job for up to 30 minutes. By the end of an hour or so, it has deteriorated to the point that it will no longer destroy pathog ens but it can still combine with various other chemicals. Okay, so maybe I was over enthusiastic in saying “vast amounts of energy” as it doesn’t sound very scientific. So let’s just say, chlorine dioxide begins to deteriorate almost immediately until it is no longer chlorine dioxide. It separates into its constituents of chlorine, oxygen, and energy and nothing else. The chlorine and oxygen under this condition have lost their charge and thus are not active. As the chlorine dioxide continues to deteriorate, so does the sodium chlorite. The deterioration of the sodi um chlorite is at approximately the same speed as the deterioration of the chlorine dioxide. Do you see? More chlorine dioxide is being gene rated by the sodium chlorite all the time. Thus as the chlorine dioxide is consumed by killing pathogens or by simple deterioration it is replaced by the continued deterioration of the sodium chlorite . The chlorine in sodium chlorite either combines with helpful chemicals that the immune system can use, or it becomes a chloride which means it becomes a tiny part of a tiny amount of table salt. Not enough to even record. The deterioration of chlori ne dioxide in the human body leaves absolutely nothing behind. The action of destroying any pathogen or other harmful item in the body leaves nothing behind but dead pathogens, and again a chloride and oxygen that can only become a part of the water of the body.

He’s in charge. I withdrew from that foundation when I realized they were not very committed to treating malaria in Africa. They informed me that they had plenty of money and millions to sp end treating malaria in Africa, but they continued with mining and ri ce distribution progr ams and nothing was happening with the program to di stribute the MMS in Africa. If they really were committed, and they were too busy, they could have sent me. We have the answer to the disease that has been the biggest killer of mankind for hundreds of years. So while millions of people suffer and die, what is my group doing? We’re over in Africa giving out rice bran packets to school children. That’s a nice program. It’s nice to help children, but our organization was fo rmed to solve the problem of malaria. I may be beating this point to death, but there were a number of people who could not see why I left the foundation and concentrated on writing this book. After several years I finally realized th at I could not leave the data of the MMS information in their hands. The world would probably never know about it. It was then that I finally realized that this information simply cannot be owned or controlled by a ny one person or group. The Malaria Solution Foundation Web Site (malariasolution.com) will also tell you much about the programs that we conducted in Africa and maybe give you some more confidence in what I have been saying. The MMS really works. (This site, by the way, was just fini shed in the last part of 2006. It was 5 years since I was first told that they were going to put up a good site). Their last trip to Malawi was la st year. It had no thing to do with curing malaria in that country. It had to do with distributing rice bran packets to orphanages. That is a feel good program; but what we founded the Foundation for is not getting done. You could also check if you want to, with the Malawi government. They conducted their own separate tests w ith the Malaria Solution (the MMS) and got the same results as we did in the prison, 90% cure for malaria patients in less than 24 hours and 100% cure in 48 hours. Nothing else has ever had even a 10% cure rate in 24 hours or 48 hours.

Please don’t take my word for it; become informed. Read the information available on the Internet. Just go to any search engine and put in “FDA Suppression.” There is voluminous documentation, starting back in the 1930’s. They often put authors in jail and told them that they will withdraw the accusations if the author would withdraw his claims. Once the author has lost all of his money and is tired of fighting he gives up. There are hundreds of medical facts that are suppressed right now that would save thousands of lives around the world. There are many records of people who have died under very questionable conditions when they have tried to inform the people. Please don’t write this off as a bunch of crazy conspiracy nuts. The MMS is one more medical fact that they will try to suppress. Try it and know that it works. Your life and the lives of thousands, even millions, are at stak e. Isn’t that important enough to at least try it once on some one, or on you? Spend a couple of hours researching this issue. The facts are there. Treating Symptoms: Modern medicine, by way of doctors, treats symptoms. Drugs that you buy at any pharmacy are 99% directed towards symptoms. In other words, if you have a headache, the doctor gives you something for the pain, but doesn’t find out what is causing the headache. If you can’t sleep, the drug is something that helps you sleep, but the doctor does n’t find out what is keeping you awake. If you get arthritis in th e knee the doctor gives you a drug for the pain, he doesn’t find the reaso n for the arthritis. If you have poor digestion the doctor gives you a tablet that neutralizes the acid and allows the food to go through wi thout digesting. He doesn’t find the cause of the poor digestion, or even give you something that will digest the food. There are a th ousand different drugs directed at symptoms and the side effect of ma ny of these drugs is death. All drugs have side effects. Not all of them have death as a side effect, but regardless, most of them have caused death at one time or another. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 120 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Why do you suppose drugs in this world, especially in America, almost always treat symptoms and not the cause of diseases? It’s no secret about drugs only treating sy mptoms, most people know that already. Ask any person interested in health. Medical drugs treat symptoms and all of the medi cal research by pharmaceutical companies is directed towards t reating symptoms, and not towards finding the cause of the problem. Well, the reason is that if you find the cause of a disease or health problem you can usually cure the problem. In that case you cannot continue to sell the drug over and over until the person dies. Billions of dollars are involved. Treating symptoms does not cure or change the problem. What is the reason that there has been no significan t advancement in cancer treatment technology in 100 years? With on e or two minor exceptions, the same treatments are still used mo re than 100 years later. The world has advanced fantastically in almost everything but cancer treatment and many other diseas e treatments. They refine the treatment, make the drugs more pure, make the needles better, make the X-ray machines better, ma ke the records better, they make the timers better that time the tr eatment, but the treatment itself does not change. The pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars with two lawyers and often two law offices for each congressman and each senator in the United States. They have tried again and again to suppress vitamins. I don’t have time to cover all of the facts here. Please become informed on this subject. The data and the proof are available. The truth cannot be supp ressed. Just read the thousands of documents available on the Internet. They spend billions influencing Congress on the pretense of public safety. Do you imagine that we would be much safer if we didn’t know about vitamins? The truth affects all countri es of the world. At this time the FDA just informed the public th at it intends to shut down over 50% of the alternate health type supplement companies. This is because they finally prevailed upon Congress to pass a law stating that all supplements must be under FDA control. Now, the MMS is such a simple cure that it need not be relegated to doctors. The public at large has the ability to treat themselves. This"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Understanding the Miracle Mineral Supplement Chapter 9 Page 121 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century means that the FDA is going to have a much harder time at suppressing this one. The public, the sick and suffering have this one short window that will be open , we don’t know for how long. But this time the FDA cannot suppre ss a couple of doctors or arrest the author of a book. (They can’t fi nd me.) Luckily I am not tied to some expensive lab, and I can move around. But they don’t have to find me to stop it. The billions of dollars behind them will definitely try, because ultimately a great part of those billions are lost if the MMS becomes well known.

Up to this point they are so convinced that I am a charla tan that they have paid me no attention. It’s my only safe gu ard. But when they start getting reports of people getting well and people being cured, it will be a different story. This now is now th e second printing of this book. The first printing sold out and thousands of people were cured of many different diseases, but many who used the book did not pass the information on to their friends. Many did, but many did not.

There is a point, I don’t know how many people that is, but a point can be reached which I call the point of no return. If we reach that point, the window can no longer be slammed in our face.

It is amazing that an inventor should have discovered it instead of one of the world’s most prominent scientists. Apparently, it’s just too simple for science as the information has been available for 100 years. It was mostly luck that I was in the position to make the discovery. No doubt, 60 years of spir itual seeking made the discovery possible. As with MMS, now discovere d, I really have to tell the world. It must be told far and wide or I would forever suffer the consequences, as the sin of omission is just as bad as the sin of commission, as far as karma is concerned I can’t say what it is right up front , because I’d probably lose you. But hang on for a few paragraphs and le t me surprise you. I was first introduced to sodium chlorite in about 1985. It was used to purify water and kill the diseases on tropical fish so far as I knew. It was actually being used at that time many places in the world to purify water and as a health drink. I soon discovered that some health food stores carried it and it was called stabilized oxygen. Th ere was always a fair market for it as it seemed to help recovery fr om many different diseases. There were always many great claims for sodium chlorite (sold as Stabilized Oxygen) but like most medicines it s eemed to work only for some people and ten only some of the time. After my discovery in the jungle th at Stabilized Oxygen cured malaria part of the time and then by addition of a food acid it cured malaria all the time, I began to see hundreds of pe ople recover from diseases. When I traveled to Africa I wa tched thousands of peopl e recover from malaria and other diseases. Then while I lived in my small desert town I watched more people recover from diseases. During that time I sent many bottles of MMS to Africa and hundreds more were cured mostly of malaria, but other things as well. One time I sent enough for one person to treat over 5000 people of malaria in Sierra Leone, another time over"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"A New Look at Disease  Chapter 9.5  Page 124 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century 1600. And of course, there were many times where one or two or ten bottles were sent. (I should mention that some of these times Arnold furnished the money for me to send these bottles, and sometimes he didn’t.) In addition to that I sold and gave many bottles around town and the neighboring town and other places in the US. I’m not saying all this to brag. I hope that isn’t what it so unds like. I’m trying to make a point. So before I make the point, let me al so say that since I came to Mexico one year ago, I have had several thousand emails and hundreds of phone calls. Many were those asking questions, but there were also those who were telling me how they had lost their disease symptoms from Lupus, Diabetes, Hepatitis A, B, and C, AI DS, Cancer, and many other diseases. In Hermosillo my Mexican school t eacher partner, Clara Beltrones, has treated about 100 people in her home, many while I was present. To give you an example, last night (t his is 12/14/07) a man called and brought his wife by after hearing a local radio talk show. She came in with a standard walker that you pus h along, but she could not hold on to the walker so he had to hold her hand on the walker. Her right hand and foot was both paralyzed. She had tr ouble walking on the foot. She complained that her sciatica was giving her much pain. Clara gave her a 6 drops dose one and had her wait one hour while they di scussed things. The lady notice the pain going away in her sciati ca in the first hour and that feeling was coming back in her hand. After the second 6 drops dose one hour later she noticed feelings coming to her foot. Soon she was moving her fingers and her toes. Befo re she left she had regained full movement of her hand and her foot. She could move all her toes and the other muscles in her foot. She left, still using the walker, but she did not need help from her husband, and it wa s obvious that she would soon be walking without the walker as she got a little more used to her new mobility. I don’t mean to say that everyone is instantly heal ed. Many work with it a lot longer and sometimes there are other things involved with problems other than diseases. Within one year of arriving in Mexico I had sold more than 8,000 books The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century, and more than 11,000 5.5 ounce bo ttles of MMS were being sold in the US each month. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"A New Look at Disease  Chapter 9.5  Page 125 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century It’s going to be up to the scientists to prove or disprove what I say here, but I see ample evidence to prove that most disease, I’d say up to 95% of all disease is caused by pathogens that can be killed. That includes 95% of all discomforts not caused by acci dents. That includes 95% of all blood diseases, all cancers, and all othe r so called disorders of mankind. Do you see what I am saying; we are on the edge of solving most disease for mankind forever. Hundreds of times people come to me and recently to Clara to get a bottle of MMS and they take a dose as we want to show them how to mix the drops. Within minutes their pain of 20 years is gone. Do you see? MMS has no nutritional value what-s o-ever. It is a killer, only. It kills pathogens and oxidizes heavy me tal poisons. It does nothing else. The only answer is that there was something that was killed as that is only what MMS can do. One might say that some heavy metals were oxidized and that can be the case, sometimes, but there have been times where the subject had first been tested for heavy metals and there were none. It really doesn’t matter, does it ? If the people are well, who cares? So far thousands of people have go tten well. I have come to the conclusion that there are thousands of kinds of bacteria, viruses, molds, yeasts, parasites, fungus and other microorganisms that have no name and are not recognized. There are othe r organisms necessarily micro in nature many of which are pleomorphic in that they can switch back and forth from one kind of microorganism to another. Medical science has no clue about most of them, but when you kill them, the person becomes well and goes back to work or to his life. We can’t say they were cured as it upsets almost everyone, incl uding people on our side. Maybe someone can come up with a better answ er as to why all these people got well, but for now no one has. So here is a new look at diseases. People who are sick and in pain are often told that they are imagining it, or that they need it for some reason, or that it is a condition brought on by their genes, or inherited. They often spend thousands of dollars for psychiatric help, and are often even convinced that they are really making it up. Or their mother didn’t love them or some such thing. However, in almost every case, pain that was supposed to be made up mentally was often gone in an hour or two or"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"A New Look at Disease  Chapter 9.5  Page 126 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century three or several weeks, af ter they began taking MMS. So here is a new look at disease. Colonies of virus or bacteria may set right up against a bone and thrive on the bone creating acids that cause much pain. Or mold can gather in areas of low blood flow and grow preventing the flow of nutrients in th at area and using the nutrients that do get there. A colony of viruses that live in a muscle can cause muscle pains. Or a colony of virus can from around a nerve and shut off the nerve impulses. Some colonies are worse than others. It is well known that colonies of bacteria can grow on a heart valve, why not other places? Some colonies cause arthritis and others cause diabetes and a hundred other things. So here is another look at disease. You didn’t get sick because you ate too much sugar. You didn’t get si ck because you ate too much white bread, or too much ice cream, or too much meat or even that you ate too much acid causing foods. All of these things can be contributing factors, and they all can feed microorganisms and thus help them thrive, but the real reason that you got sick wa s because microorganisms, mostly anaerobic micro-organisms, invade d areas of your body. Your body is really stronger than most people beli eve. Colonies grow here and there or they invaded your entire body or th ey invaded various organs of your body. There were and are other factor s, such as you breathed too much poisonous smoke, or allowed your body to become too cold, or other such problems, but all those things result in colonies of anaerobic microorganisms starting to grow or getting worse. Some researchers have reported that when the brains of a person who had Alzheimer’s disease is investigated that they find spiroquetes, a form the microorganism that is often cons idered pleomorphic (they morph into various other viruses or microor ganisms). Don’t ask me about Alzheimer’s. No one has called saying that he has treated a person with Alzheimer’s or has treated himself fo r Alzheimer’s. I have had emails asking about it, but none doing it. Ju st about everything else has been treated and someone has called to mention it, but not Alzheimer’s.

Again, this is not to brag but just to mention that I am not totally scientifi cally illiterate. Thus I can make the statements here and then there will be those who want to either prove me wrong, or those who want to prove me right. I am sure that there will be people who will be checking to prove one way or the other because there are those who have already begun to investigate my suggestions. It is my suggestion that we have tu rned the corner in to a new age where there is no such thing as an incurabl e disease. The death knoll for the drug companies has already been r ung. Medical doctors will be needed to set bones, improve breasts, do pl astic surgery, and various other physical body related things. Alternate medicine practitioners will work mainly with nutrition to improve health, but they will be little concerned with overcoming diseases. Imagine for a minute, if you will, a world populated with healthy people, where ther e is extremely little disease. It can be a reality in your lifetime if you pitch in and help a little. Hundreds of millions of do llars of research are n eeded for research with MMS, but we are closing in on it. Many people are already very successf ully with treating their selves. Just see that this book gets out to as many people as you can, and see that as many people get and try a bottle of MMS as possible. If the person next door cannot afford a bottle, well buy him one yourself. Do your part and we will arrive. That is all th at the world needs at this point is a bit of help from you, the reader of this book. The world may never meet you, but it won’t happen without your help, and the day will come that you will know that you really helpe d. You will know that you did your part to stop the drug companies and help those less fortunate overcome their diseases. Now that you have looked at the good part let me tell you about the bad part. In other words, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news, and I mean really bad news. I wanted to tell you the good part first as I don’t like to be a doomsayer. Let me tell you the situation on Earth is worse than 99.999% of the population understan ds. I have people call me from all over the world. I have thousands of Emails. I have talked to hundreds of people."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"A New Look at Disease  Chapter 9.5  Page 128 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century So what have I found? Well, you w on’t like it. And you will think I’m crazy, but I’ve got to say it as I could not live with myself if I didn’t. And I’d really rather not mention it as there are enough people who think I’m nuts already, but I’ve got to if onl y to get some people to thinking. It’s this: Our leaders are trying to kill us. I talk to medical doctors, to clinics, to health professionals, and to sick people every day. I doubt that anyone else talks to more than me from across section of the health industry from across section of the world. What I have found is this. There are many new diseases out there. These diseases are not natural diseases. There are dozens if not hundr eds of new diseases. All of the natural diseases like flu, TB, pne umonia, diabetes, malaria and the others, MMS handles in a very short time. The recently created diseases are much harder to handle as they se em to have a certain ability to hide in the body when antibodies or oxida tion chemicals are present. All these new diseases are traceable back to laboratories of the Government. None came from monkeys. Our leaders refuse to do anything to stop it when informed. There is no way that I can tell you th e whole story in a few paragraphs. There is mercury in vaccinations, chemotherapy simply kills people nothing more, foods are poisoned with Aspartame, modern medicine has killed and is killing more people than all the wars put together, and the America public isn’t as dumb as some people think. More than 55% of the public has quit going to their family medical doctor and has opted for alternate medical techniques. There must be a reason for that. People don’t just quit going to someone who is keeping them well. Millions and millions of people are sick from diseases that the government doesn’t even recognize. Mo rgallens disease is only one of a series of terrible diseases that millions now have that the government doesn’t recognize. Lyme has been a disease not recognized by medicine and only now by a few doctors yet millions have the lyme disease in the world. There are dozens of others . The World Health Organization (WHO) refuse to go any further than one doctor even after they were told of 75,000 victims cured of malaria. Th eir doctor claimed he tested it, but that makes no sense. He was in Switzer land. No malaria there. People are well in 4 hours. Tes ting can be done in one day. Yet it took him a"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"A New Look at Disease  Chapter 9.5  Page 129 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century year and a half to get around to testing it, and then after 3 days he said it wouldn’t work. Once a doctor understands the chemical formula of MMS, he usually will agree that it ha s merit. It is so obvious that few doctors have to even test it before agreeing that at least it should work. For you religious Christian people, be aware, the Bible tells that in the last days the Earth will be deluge d with disease and sickness. I don’t believe in the Bible as religious people do, but there are some things there that make one think. Lyme disease comes from many other places than just ticks. You can get it from sex, from eating certain meat, even from certain supplies of water. There are those who want to kill the human race. They have been working at it for a lot longer than you would believe if I told you. It’s no t an easy job, killing the human race, but they have been at it for a god- awful long time. I’m here, right now, watching it every day. No one is sure where morgallens disease comes from, but hundreds of thousands of people have it, probably millions. There are those who think that it traces to the chem trails in the sky. But we don’t know. Millions and millions of dollars are being spent on those chem trails. I know, if you are normal, you are going to tell me those chem trails are just commercial airplanes flying by, and the morgallens disease is nothing more than psychological, and the lyme disease is cured by the family doctor. And then you will tell me that the reason that we have not improved in the treatment of cancer fo r over 100 years is because all of the research has found nothing better than surgery and the poison of chemo or radiation. And if you tell me that then it will never have occurred to you that science should have an answer. About the chem Trails in the sky: Friends of mine have been in an airplane in the sky right next to a cargo plane that was dumping thousands of pounds of powdered chemi cals out the rear. Don’t tell me they don’t exist, because they do. Too many people have seen the evidence. Then, of course, there is AIDS and the millions of people dying from AIDS. Did you know that in the US, more people died for hepatitis C than AIDS? And many die from AIDS. The point is the public"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"A New Look at Disease  Chapter 9.5  Page 130 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century trustingly goes on dying lik e flies with it never occurring to the majority that anything is wrong. There are dozen s of diseases that you have never heard of and I only hear of now and then, but thousands are either killed by them or disabled by them. Many ca ll me in terrible pain or suffering asking if MMS will he lp or if I know a way to use MMS more effectively. It breaks my heart ev ery time. We should have a hundred million dollars to work with this to find the answers. But we have nothing, still we are getting more da ta each day and I believe we will have the answers to all of these gove rnment generated diseases within a reasonable time, hopefully less than a year.

Humble 3 rd Edition "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century What this Book is About I hope you do not think that this book tells about just another very interesting suppl ement that can help some people after taking it for several months. Not so. This Miracle Mineral supplement works in a few hours. The #1 killer of mankind in the world today is malaria , a disease that is usually overcome by this supple ment in only four hours in most cases. This has been proven through clinical trials in Malawi, a country in eastern Africa . In killing the malaria parasite in the body, there was not a single failure. More than 75,000 malaria victims ha ve taken the Miracle Mineral Supplement and are now back to work and living productive lives. After taking the Miracle Mineral Supplement AIDS patients are often disease free in three days and other diseases and conditions simply disappear . If patients in the nearest hospital were treated with this Miracle supplement, over 50% of them would be back home within a week. For more than 100 years clinics and hospitals have used the active ingredients in this supplement to sterilize hospital floors, tables, equipment, and other items. Now this same powerful germ - killer can be harnessed by the immune system to safely kill pathogens in the human body. Amazing as it might seem, when used correctly, the immune system can use this killer to only attack those germs, bacteria and viruses that are harmful to the body, and does not affect the friendly bacteria in the body nor any of the healthy cells. In this book I have, to the best of my ab ility, stuck to the facts of exactly what has happened regarding the Miracle Mineral Supplement. This book is the story of the discovery and further development of the most amazing enhancement for the immune system yet discovered. Thus it is the greatest solution to mankind ’ s diseases and ills now known; it is not a drug. I believe if you follow my efforts to develop this data and to make it available to the public, the story will help make it real to you and convince you to give it a try. To that purpos e I have provided complete details on how to make the supplement in your kitchen , or to buy most of the ingredients off the shelf. It is entirely possible that you will save someone ’ s life or your own. Because the Miracle Mineral Suppl ement functions as a supercharger to the immune system, it is not meant for treatmen t of any particular disease; rather it is meant to improve the immune system to the point of overcoming many diseases, frequently in less than 24 hours. My purpose for wri ting this book is that this information is far too important to allow any one person, one group or even several groups to have control. It"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century is information that the world should have. After 5 years of seeing practically nothing done by a group that could h ave done a great deal, I finally realized that the information simply had to be distributed to as many people as possible or someone would always be out of the loop of receiving this life saving data. It regularly occurs that there is a great deal of impo rtant medical information withheld from the public that could save lives. It is my intention to prevent that from happening with this information.    "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century For e w or d This for ewo rd is written by Dr. Hector Francisco R o mero G. , a m edical doctor i n the state of Sonora, Mexico where he has a very successful clinic that treat s cancer and many other illnesses considered incurable . He uses the MMS talked about in this book and a number of other non intrusive treatments. He is well k nown in Sonora for th e work that he has done with Mexican Indians. Dr. Romero makes me look much greater than I am, but then how co uld I refuse his foreword. Dr. Romero writes: A dear good old friend of mine and respectful philosopher t eacher impeller of man of good temper in this desert state of Sonora Mexico us ed to say: “Those men who live “ the University of Life,” would leave footprints in this world.” Not just anyone builds up and wr ites with his own ideas “a book ” . This is the sam e case with my friend Jim Humble. This personality is a c hallenger, a world walker, an anxious person, who has fought all his life to leave footprints with his contributions of investigation to man humanity. He has covered thousands and thousands of kilome ters as his investigation has shown in this book, suffering infect ious illness of Malaria; an illness which put his life at risk, demonstrating to medical science that it is possible to count with new alternatives treatments. It will give a better quality of life to those sick ones from endemics zones, as Jim says, in latitudes like in the region of Africa , Asia, and South A merica . In these places there is a lot of mortality due to malaria and other virus infections such as the HIV, causing the death statistics to be very considerable and is higher compared to other places in the world. His product was investigated and well recognized by the health authorities in an African country. With the MMS, he offers them better ho pes and quality of life. Especially, those who have the threats of these man destructive illnesses. Our experience in Mexico with the MMS, in the state of Sonora has been to treat some illnesses that are contagious febrile infections, inflammatory degene rative tumors, prostate cancer , and some other malignant tumors, with good and hopefully results. For all of these , I pray to god so he can have a great intelligence so he continues helping those towns of the world that have no hope an d are forgotten, specially the children that deserve our attention for a life, and a better future.

I     do not suggest that the MMS cures diseases. It just supplies the immune system with a killer that it c an use. When using the MMS the immune system probably becomes more than 100 times more efficient. (Please note: Some of the basic concepts are repeated a number of times in this book. The reason for this is that people have a tendency to look up the ins tructions or concepts and then they want to go and use what they have read. They may not have read the whole book. In fact, they usually have not. In that case, hopefully the data has been repeated enough that they will get the essence of the idea. But please read the whole book.) PLEASE NOTE : This chapter has been rewritten for the third edition of this book. Mistakes have been corrected and data has been updated as we have learned new things from the thousands of people reporting. Please consider t his chapter as the latest data and if there is any conflict between this book and earlier books this book should take preference. Mostly, only minor mistakes have been corrected, however the Standard Protocol, the Cancer Protocol, and the Protocol for flu , colds, pneumonia and other general diseases added at the end of this chapter are important. About the size of drops: Drops dropped from different size droppers are different in size. The larger the end of the dropper, the larger the drop will be. I refer in all cases to the standard MMS bottle and cap shown in this book (a four ounce green bottle is used). A “standard” eye dropper will create drops 2/3 the size of the drops that drop from the standard MMS bottle. If you are using a standard glass e ye dropper that comes down to a point as shown below, you should multiply the number of drops given in all the recipes in this book by 1.5. Again, I stipulate, anywhere the drops are mentioned in this book, multiply the number by 1.5 if you are using the s tandard eye dropper. (See the pictures below.) When using the bottle dropper cap shown below, use the exact same number of drops that is suggested in the recipes of this book. Avoid using other droppers than these two mentioned here, to prevent getting t he wrong amount of solution."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 11 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century In case the world has stopped using bottle dropper caps as shown below, the dropper end size in this cap is .180” X .180” square. The dropper end size of the Standard Eye Dropper is round and .125” in diameter. All amounts of MMS given in the various receipts are approximate. For those who are more scientifically inclined, 17 drops from the bottle cap equals one milliliter (that’s one CC). It takes about 25 drops from the standard eyedropper to equal one milliliter. Water is not the same weight as MMS so don’t go astray with various other numbers concerning drops. MMS is 20% heavier than water and that changes the size of drops and the number of the drops for one ml.  Drops in a Teaspoon : A level teaspoon of lemon juice or 10% citric acid solution is about 80 drops. So a qu arter teaspoon is 20 drops. A little too much lemon juice or citric acid makes no difference at all. Just don’t get too little or you get poor results. On the other hand, a little too much MMS can make you sick so always count the drops for MMS. How t o Use MMS For Personal Health : MMS can change the health of your mouth in one week. The health of your mouth is the most important thing to first address with MMS, because the health of your mouth affects the health of your entire body . So when you begi n to take MMS also make sure your treat your mouth. After seeing thousands of people getting better after taking MMS, the ones that do the best are the ones that make their mouth healthy. 1 Figure 1 when us ing drops from a standard eye dropper always multiply the number of drops suggested in the book by 1.5. 2 Figure 2 when using drops from this bottle cap use the same number of drops suggested in this book.

Use 10 drops of MMS in a glass and add 50 drops of lemon , or lime juice, or 10% citric acid solution in the same glass. As usual swirl the mixture, wait 3 minutes and then add about ¼ glass of water. Use this solution to brush the teeth . You can use the same solution the brush your teeth and gums two or three times a day when you are first starting. Be sure to brush your gums. Use a new solution every morning. The MMS will brighten and strengthen the enamel on your teeth. What really happens is that the MMS kills the virus on the enamel that ordinarily does the damage Abscessed teeth , infected gums , and pyorrhea: Expect the pain of an abscessed tooth to be overcome by the immun e system in about four hours. Expect all infection and all pyorrhea to be gone in one week. Expect all loose teeth to be rock solid in two weeks. Expect a completely healthy mouth in less than three weeks. Keep in mind that the MMS solution is the most powerful killer of pathogens known. Once the pyorrhea and infections are killed, the mouth can heal very quickly. Finally you will need to use MMS only two or three times a week and actually you could even get aw ay with brushing only two or three times a week. There are exceptions, of course. In the case of an abscessed tooth where the abscess is inside the tooth and the MMS cannot reach it through a hole or some other way, the MMS will not then handle the absce ss. It will have to be pulled. Also you need to get rid of all the metal in your mouth. With metal in your mouth you are creating voltages and current that can be read on any volt meter. It’s ruining your health. I’ve seen people who regained their s ight merely by replacing the metal in their mouth. As far as treating diseases is concerned, 15 drops are a standard dose . That of course means, that you also add one teaspoon of lime juice, or lemon juice and the 15 dro ps (from the cap in Figure 2 above) in a clean dry glass. (A teaspoon is 80 drops.) Then swirl the glass to mix the juice and drops and then you wait three minutes. After three minutes you add about 1/3 glass of water or fresh apple , grape , cranberry , or pineapple juice and then drink immediately. Without the vinegar , or lime juice, or lemon juice it will not work. Although it is acceptable to add water, juice wi ll also work if it does not have vitamin C added to it. Normally one would then give a second 15 drop dose in one hour. However, as already mentioned, 15 drops is too much to start with, thus one would start with less. But still, tw o doses one hour apart is often a very good idea. It seems to get better penetration. Please read this entire chapter for more data. Please read the protocols (how to use) at the end of this chapter. "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 13 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century There is a problem with a 15 drop dose . If the pers on taking such a dose is not fairly healthy, it will have a tendency to cause nausea . The immune system attacks unhealthy conditions using the MMS. There has never been any evidence of an attack on healthy cells. But if one supplies the immune system with excessive MMS, the immune system appears to attack unhealthy conditions vigorously. It’s what the body needs, but a nauseous reaction sometimes occurs, occasionally even vomiting. When this does occur, one has simpl y taken a large dose at first. When you kill a lot of bacteria , virus or parasites that have poison in them, that poison is likely to be dumped into the system. For this reason it is advisable to give a dose of tw o drops or even one for the first dose just to see what is going to happen. When giving two drop doses or any dose, one should use 5 drops of vinegar , lime juice or citric acid solution for each drop of MMS. Or read further in this chapter to learn about using citric acid instead of vinegar or lime. Situations vary; the healthier a person is the more drops he or she can start with. When a person is very sick, start with two drops or even one dr op and go to the second drop immediately if the first drop didn’t make him nauseous . Wait a couple of hours and increase by one drop. Back off for a while if he shows signs of being sicker. A very sick person should receive a dose of some strength every four hours during the day and in some cases every hour , but very small doses . Almost always the sick person will begin to feel better within 24 hours. If the MMS is used by the immune system to break loose some poisons that can then make a person a little nauseous. Just don’t give up. Reduce the number of drops per dose to a point where the person is not experiencing nausea . Start increasing the drops at each dose as long as the person does not become nauseous. Kee p at it until you have reached 15 drop doses that do not make the person nauseous. Then do two 15 drop doses within two hours. Do that a second time during the day. Keep doing the same each day until the person is well. Normally a person will be well by the time he has increased doses to 15 drops, but if not keep at it. Larger than 15 drop doses : As already mentioned, if 15 drops is good, so maybe 45 drops is three times as good. Normally don’t go that far. In extreme cases maybe try a couple of 25 d rop doses within two hours of each other. The fact is I have had reports back from people who, when they did not get the results they wanted, resorted to as much as two 25 drops within 2 hours. In that case they were careful to use 1.5 teaspoons of lemon or lime or 10% citric acid solution. The wait is three minutes or slightly longer. Never, never, never start off with 25 drops. In fact, only in extreme cases go to more than 15 drop doses. The t wo doses within two hours counts as a very large dose. Be careful. See later in this chapter for how to mix the citric acid solution. "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 14 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century However, I should report also that there have been a few cases that have reported curing prostate cancer by taking as much as 60 drop doses. At least one other person has reported taking 100 drops a day for over a week. Exception to the rule : One would only start off with a large dose such as 15 drops in the case of parasites . If o ne had taken a poison or has food poisoning, a good dose of MMS will often help. My friend next door caught some kind of a walking around flu. His throat was sore and he was continuously coughing and hacking. It went on for three weeks and didn’t let up. He then began taking the MMS. He took 15 drop doses for several days with no change. Then out of desperation he squirted in a 30 drop dose. He added a teaspoon of vinegar , waited the three minutes, added the apple juice and downed it. The next day the hacking and coughing was gone. He took a second 30 drop dose and the next day the rest of the symptoms were gone. Later just for research, he tried several doses larger than 3 0 drops, but he noticed a metallic taste in his mouth the rest of the day, so he decided never to go over 30 drops. I am saying, however, never go over 15 drops unless you absolutely have to. Normally, lately, I suggest lemon , lime or 10% citric acid solution instead of vinegar . All other factors should remain the same. I have found that many people prefer lime or lemon juice over vinegar. Anyone suspected of having Candida shou ld not use vinegar in any amount. When counting drops, always use 5 drops of lemon or lime juice or 5 drops of the 10% citric acid juice for each drop of MMS. The vinegar has a tendency to feed Candida and there are those who have reported Candida gettin g worse after a few days using vinegar. Citric Acid a recent discovery: Dr. Hesselink , the doctor who has written the last chapter of this book made an important discovery concerning citric acid . He was get ting his friend ready to go to Africa to use the MMS there. He felt it would be best to give his friend bottles with the dry MMS powder (sodium chlorite) and then in Africa his friend could just add water to the bottles. He then decided to do the same with the lemon juice to be used as the activator . For this purpose he bought citric acid powder since that is the acid in lemons. Well it worked fine. His friend made a big hit and helped many sick p eople get well. After the Doctor’s friend returned from Africa Dr. Hesselink was sitting talking to one of his other friends who had lyme arthritis , which was an extremely b ad case of lyme arthritis. He suggested his friend to mix a dose of MMS and drink the same as the one his friend had used in Africa. That was 12 drops of MMS and 60 drops of citric acid solution. He did so and amazingly the arthrit is was gone the next morning but he has reported that it returned in about 6 weeks, since then he requires a dose every few weeks."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 15 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Dr. Hesselink has used MMS and citric acid to kill lyme arth ritis with several other people. So I have been recommending using the lemon juice at that same strength for some time and it is also working. Evaluation of the Citric acid incident : Obviously the citric acid works as hundreds of people have used it so far and it worked on Dr. Hesselink ’s friend’s arthritis . Instructions for using MMS with citric acid as the activator (instead of vinegar or lemon or lime ) : Obtain citric acid in powder form as citric acid crystals. Some health food stores carry them, or you can order them f rom a pharmacy (heaven forbid). Make a 10% solution of citric acid. To make a 10% solution put one level tablespoon full of crystals in a clean glass or jar. Then add 9 level tablespoons full of purified water into the same jar. When the crystals have dissolved this is a 10% solution. In all cases when using the citric acid as an activator, use 5 drops for each 1 drop of MMS. Do everything else the same. Wait 3 minutes after mixing, add juice and drink. Since there was some confusion about mixing th e citric acid, let me clarify a bit. When you use 9 measures of water to one measure of citric acid crystals that gives you a 10% solution, but that is not a 10 to 1 mixture as some have thought. That is a 9 to 1 mixture. But that gives you 10 parts, th at’s 9 parts water plus 1 part acid equal’s 10 parts total. It is however, a 10% solution of citric acid. When using the citric acid as an activator be sure to keep in mind all of the other instructions concern ing taking the MMS. Start with taking 2 drops of MMS and ten drops of citric acid and then work up to greater amounts, or even start with 1 drop MMS and 5 drops of citric acid. Lyme disease : For the most part Lyme disease seems to be the worst of all so long as you are talking about diseases that are very hard to cure or that destroy the various organs of the body and is extremely disabling. In the case of Lyme no doubt the immune system needs MMS. The best result s so far has been with MMS activated with the citric acid solution as given in this chapter. So far the best result has been to shock the system with a 9 or 10 drop dose on the first dose and then a 12 drop dose on the second dose. This has put the Lyme disease into remission for up to 6 weeks, but then more drops are required. But everyone realizes that remission isn’t what they want, they want a cure. So if one continues with MMS I have had some reports of people who are doing v ery well indeed, by taking smaller doses but 3, 4 and 5 times a day. In most cases if you are not improving, probably you are not taking enough. However, it might take as long as a year to overcome the Lyme disease . There is no proof of that yet, but the information I have received back is that everyone who has Lyme and who is taking MMS is experiencing improvement."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 16 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century What time during the day is best to take MMS? It is best to take MMS just before going to bed. MMS works very fast, and the body likes to start healing very fast. People often become sleepy after taking a dose of MMS. That simply means that the body wants to begin healing. It is well known that most healing is done during sleep. If you get sleepy a fter a dose of MMS it is a very good sign so take a nap if you can. You will probably feel much better when you awaken. Also, if you take it twice in a day, take one of the doses in the evening before going to bed. However, if you feel a cold coming o n in the morning or in the afternoon do not wait until bedtime to take a dose. Take a dose anytime you feel like something is trying to come on. Children: It is perfectly safe to have children and babies take the MMS. Of course, chi ldren must have fewer drops than adults. The formula for babies is one drop at first and increase up to three drops in the same day. Of course always use the 5 drops of citric acid activator for each drop of MMS . Other than babies, use 3 drops MMS for each 25 pounds (11.4 KG) of body weight for children. Overweight people: Start with 2 drops only for the first dose and work up to 3 drops per each 25 pounds of body weight. Follow instruct ions given in this chapter for “working up” to higher doses, but do work up to 3 drops for each 25 pounds of body weight. Overweight people have more trouble overcoming flu and other diseases as the pathogens hide in the fat tissues. Malaria: The procedure for malaria is to always start with a 15 drop dose, and give a second 15 drops dose in one to two hours. (Remember, if you use a standard eye dropper; multiply these figures by 1.5 which in this case would be rounded off to 23 drops). Expect most of the symptoms to be gone within four hours of the second dose, but don’t worry if the symptoms are not gone after four hours beyond the second dose, simply give a third dose. All malaria parasites are dead after the second dose. If the patient is still sick, it will not be from malaria. It will be from some other disease. In that case, continue with at least two 15 drop doses each day until they are feeling well. Arthritis: There are some things that you should know about arthritis if you have the problem. First, it doesn’t matter how bad it is, your body will heal it, but you have to follow the correct procedure. So you need to know what kind of arthritis you have a s MMS will help with rheumatoid arthritis and lyme arthritis and some others, but not with normal arthritis. Normal arthritis is caused by the muscles in the area pulling in the wrong direction. The wrong muscles are trying to take over and move the body in"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 17 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century that area. When these muscles begin to pull against one another they create pain and tension in the area and begin to destroy the joint. You can get it back to work again. The book Pain Free by Pete Egoscue tells how to get the correct muscles back to work again, and the body then heals the joint no matter how bad the bones are scraping against one another. It just requires some unusual exercises to get the correct muscles back to work correctly. In most cases, even severe ones, the pain is gone in a week. So buy the book at any large book store. Paperback was $15 the last time I looked. Most other forms of arthritis can be handled with the MMS. Just use the standard prot ocol at the end of this chapter. Hepatitis A, B, and C and all other strains of Hepatitis: the patients needs 15 drops twice a day, but will not usually tolerate 15 drops. When using 15 drops immediately, the immune system attacks too hard. Start with t wo drops and if that does not make them nauseous try three drops on the next dose later that same day. If it does make them nauseous try one drop on the next dose that same day. Always continue with one drop until they can take it wit hout nausea , then go to two. Most people can start out with two drops. Keep increasing the drops until the person can take 15 drops twice a day. Be careful to avoid nausea as that often makes the person afraid of the MMS and they will quit and you won’t be able to get them to start again. Remember, the MMS is merely a health drink and you are merely furnishing ammunition to the immune system. A person needs to get used to this mineral drink. Herpes : The ads on TV ca n make you sick when you know that herpes can be easily cured when the immune system has the proper ammunition. About a week of 15 drop doses twice a day and no more herpes. Of course, one must start with two drop doses and increase daily until he has re ached 15 drop doses and then increase the 15 drop dose to twice a day for about a week. That means the herpes should be gone in about two weeks. However, in very bad cases, it might take up to two months to finally overcome the herpes. I suggest you to use the citric acid as the activator in the case of herpes. With severe cases take the MMS every two hours for several days. When taking it every two hours one can take smaller doses. This keeps the MMS penetr ating deeper and deeper. In worse cases, one may have to use the MMS intravenously. See the chapter one IV . People like to bash the ideas I give here that these things can be cured by the immune system. So before you send me a bad letter , why don’t you just try what I tell you here? It can’t cost you much and what you learn might eventually save your life. If it doesn’t work, then send me a nasty letter. Let me say though, that for every criticism there have been many hundreds of"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 18 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century encou ragements. AIDS : MMS does not attack AIDS. The immune system does. It merely needs the right ammunition. As usual start with two drops but at least three times a day. Increase the drops as quickly as you can until reaching 15 drop doses three times a day. It will take from three days to three months, but usually less than 30 days. Some cases may only clear up with intravenous injections. A doctor should always do this. See the chapter on intravenous injections. Please note: normally healthy people can take these drops without nausea , especially after a meal. Only people sick with some kind of disease will get nausea when taking the drops. However, nausea is a good indication that the drops are doing some good. J ust so you know when we first learned about the use of citric acid I measured the strength of the solution. The chlorine dioxide present measured much higher than when the vinegar or the lime or le mon juices were used. But the body seemed to tolerate it more easily and thus I decided to see what a reasonably healthy body could tolerate. I started low and built up slowly to 30 drops twice a day. I never felt any nausea or other negative reactions. Thus we know (because of the reaction from hundreds of people other than myself) that as long as there is nothing there to be killed, destroyed or neutralized one can expect no reaction from the dose. Sometimes even sick people do not experience nausea when taking MMS, but do not be surprised when people get sick or have nausea, or diarrhea, or even vomit after taking a few drops of MMS. Try to take it or give it immediately after a meal. The MMS allows the immune system to correct various conditions in the body and this creates solutions that the body must expel during the process. This is normal however; if you always start with only two drops it is unlikely that you will make anyo ne nauseous . Chlorine dioxide is more powerful than any drug by far and more powerful than any other nutrient, at least that is the case in the immune system. The immune system selects out and attacks man y things that are not natural to the body and it does it immediately. On top of that, it also destroys poisons that have been generated by the disease. That’s why thousands of malaria patients just got up out of their beds and went home in four hours. That’s why many AIDS patients in Uganda went home in three days. The fact is a single dose has at times given the immune system enough ammunition to totally overcome hepatitis C . That’s probably why it is the only thing known to overcome an abscessed tooth (when the abscess is on the outside of the tooth) . "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 19 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century On vary rare occasions someone may have a little nausea from two drops, but that seldom will be the case. I mean rare as in on e in 500 cases. But in the case of malaria and some other diseases caused by parasites , one does not start with only two drops. The malaria victim is very sick and needs relief. It takes 15 drops to do any good. S o give them 15 drops and wait a little over an hour and then give them another 15 drops. They will have tremendous relief and the malaria parasite will be dead. This is also true of many other diseases caused by parasites. On the other hand, some disease s have the ability to dig in deep and it may take weeks or even months of taking the MMS for the immune system to completely destroy them. The fact is that MMS is usually extremely fast acting. The malaria in each area is different. A friend just back from Uganda used 6 drops and then another 6 drops in an hour and that cured all of the malaria he treated (70) cases. Diarrhea and vomiting may not always be avoided . In other words, if you take MMS in any amount you may get diarrhe a. Everyone does not get diarrhea, but some people need to be cleaned out. If that is true in your case, you will probably not be able to avoid diarrhea. It seems that your body knows what is needed when MMS is taken. As the immune system becomes more activated, the more things begin to take place in the body. There are things that the body does not want to allow to be processed through the digestive system, so it will cause vomiting. It hasn’t hurt a single person so far and everyone has felt better a fter vomiting. In every case when diarrhea hits or vomiting takes place assume it is what is needed and it is a good indicator that healing is taking place. In rare cases when the body’s bowel system is not working, and one needs to eliminate he may get sick, or develop rashes on the outside of his body as the poisons are attempting to get out through the skin. In this case use a laxative. The best one that I know of that thousands use is the herb senna. Sennosides are extracted from the senna herb. T hey exercise the bowel muscles expelling more waste than any other way. Sold by Wal Mart. Using MMS in the eyes : Follow these directions WITH EXTREME CARE, as you can cause problems to your eyes. Use one drop of MMS, 2 drops of citric aci d , wait 3 minutes and add about a tablespoon of distilled water or eye drops that you buy from a drugstore. Wash your eye with the liquid from the tablespoon making sure it gets directly into your eye. Allow it to stay in for a cou ple of minutes. Do not try to guess 2 minutes. Use a watch with a second hand. Then use distilled water or eye drops to wash the eye until you are certain that you have washed every bit of liquid out of your eye. Do this every two hours until the infec tion in your eye is gone . Begin taking MMS by mouth using 3 to 4 drop doses every hour until you notice a big improvement in your eyes. If you cannot put drops in your eyes, you can depend upon the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 20 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century doses by mouth if you do it every ho ur. REMEMBER: You MUST NOT allow the liquid with a drop of MMS to remain in your eye beyond 2 minutes . If you do it can be uncomfortable for a while . (I burned my eyes once. I used inactivated MMS (I didn ’ t add any citric acid to it). I left it in my eye thinking that since I didn’t feel anything it didn’t have enough strength to do damage. But MMS that is not activated is very alkaline and it burned. It didn’t do any noticeable damage to the eye ball, but the s kin around my eyes dropped and stretched downward about an inch. I looked terrible like my eyeball might fall out and I was worried, but it cleared up in a few days.) Cancer, including leukemia : The theory here is the same. Chlori ne dioxide gives the immune system almost perfect ammunition to attack cancer cells. We believe the theory has proven true as many people with cancer have told us that the cancer went away or reduced greatly after taking the MMS. However, there is not yet enough research in this area. Still, it’s a lot better than standard medical treatment. People have often told us, and we have noticed that skin cancer usually dries up and drops off within one week of tak ing 15 drops of MMS twice a day. We do not claim that the MMS cause the effect, but we did observe the effect. Some cancers are harder to treat than others and in the case where the cancer does not start to disappear within about two weeks of starting to take 15 drops twice a day one should also get some Indian Herb from a lady in Oklahoma. An update for this 3rd edition is that when one is working with cancer and it is not getting better and over ruling concept is that you are not takin g enough MMS. Start as always with 2 drops in the morning and go to 3 drops in the afternoon. Then 4 drops the next morning then begin taking it every 4 hours, then every 2 hours. Keep increasing the dosage and frequency of taking the doses. Anytime yo u begin to notice nausea , decrease the number of drops in the doses. Then begin increasing the number of drops right away again. You could get up to 10 drops every 2 hours while awake. Also remember, you must always activate with vineg ar , or lemon , or citric acid solution, and of course, use the 3 minute wait before adding juice or water to drink it. I favor the citric acid, using 5X the number of MMS drops. The secret is mor e drops and keep at it until the cancer is gone. Find some way of checking to see if it is getting better. There are a lot of people who say that after taking the Indian Herb that their cancer went away, but again we do not claim that. She has many letters that indicate that. We merely report what people have said. The information on where to get the Indian Herb is at the end of this chapter. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 21 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Do not hesitate to go to at least 30 drops twice a day of the MMS, or 15 drops four times a day when necessary, or more. Just keep taking less if you notice nausea , but then continue to increase when the nausea go away. As I write these lines, my friend next door has just overcome a small melanoma cancer on hi s arm. I mentioned that he was taking larger doses at 25 drops per dose. (I do not necessarily recommend doses that high, but do what works). In any case he had already checked with his doctor to confirm it was actually a melanoma. After only a week of t aking the MMS the melanoma begin to have a white ring around it and it then it became smaller and smaller until after about two weeks it was gone. That is, at least we could not see it anymore and there was no longer any sore feeling. On a small cancerous sore on the back of my hand that would not go away for over a year, I put one drop of MMS mixed with 3 drops of lemon juice, and as usual waited 3 minutes and then added 2 drops of DMSO. It immediately fel t like someone had put a blow torch on my hand. But the pain was gone in 3 minutes. A large brown spot appeared much larger than the small sore. I put Vaseline and a bandage on it and in 2 days the entire brown spot fell off leaving a large gaping hole. I put more Vaseline on it and another bandage and in 4 days it healed completely up and did not even leave a scar. (Note: I have removed the warning about DMSO from this book as there seems to be no problem with it.) I would say, in this case, that the DMSO carried the MMS deep into the cancerous sore, killing it in three minutes and when the pain stopped it was dead. It is not my suggestion that anyone try this. (Let me know if you do.) Note: There are three protocols at the end of this chapter, one for cancer , one is a standard protocol, and one is for flu, colds, pneumonia, and other normal home sicknesses. Asthma : MMS has often stopped an asthma attack in 10 minutes or less, but it doesn’t work every time. MMS works best with asthma over a longer period of time. It depends upon the condition of the asthma whether or not it stops an attack instantly or how long it takes to cure a condition of asthma. MMS will always help, but if a person is “beyond repair,” the n MMS will not do the job. However, over a period of time it will often cure the asthma. One lady called up and asked if MMS would help asthma. I said that I thought it would. She began taking MMS and her asthma got worse. She called me and I said, “S ometimes it can get worse before it gets better, but don’t stop.” Well, believe it or not, she continued taking the MMS for 1.5 months with it remaining in a worse condition, but she kept the faith. She continued and refused to stop. And then it began t o get better. It continued"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 22 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century to get better until it was completely gone. The entire time only took 2 months. I don’t know what to say about that kind of faith, but it worked. Start with two drops twice a day for the first day, taking the drops after a me al. If the person gets nauseous he will often stop taking the solution and refuse to take more so be careful to avoid making someone nauseous. In any case, work up to 15 drops twice a day. It may take months before one can do this witho ut being nauseous. This is because the MMS is slowly destroying something and is bringing about detoxification of the body. (That’s what I think, but the fact is I have watched many people get well from various diseases and they usually are well and feel ing energetic when the drops are no longer causing nausea .) Asthma is not easy to clear up, but it has cleared up in those who kept with it. Arteriosclerosis : I guess there are many causes f or hardening and clogging the arteries of the body, but cholesterol seems to be one of the best known reasons. Several people have reported to date that taking the MMS reduced the clogging of the arteries due to cholesterol. One lady called to say that s he was in very bad shape. They had told her that her veins were 80% clogged. They couldn’t say how much worse because they couldn’t measure any more than that. She took large doses of 15 drops, three times a day, for 30 days and when they measured again ; the clogging was less than 50%. That is a tremendous change in 30 days. That’s not much to go on, but it gives you an idea. Remember, we are just talking about a supplement. Also remember that 975,000 people die each year from medical drug causes. N o one is dead from MMS. There is a great deal of evidence to indicate that cholesterol deposits in the arteries veins around the heart are not the cause of heart attacks. The evidence points out that the walls of these vessels, about 10 inches on the heart, are collapsed 70 to 80 times every minute with each beat of the heart for our entire lives. The walls of these vessels are strengthened by vitamin C and with a deficiency in vitamin C they lose their strength. Wh en the vessel walls crack they remain collapsed and this is when the heart attack happens. The cholesterol that medical people say is clogging the veins has really been deposited there to compensate for the deficiency in vitamin C. It is the body’s secon dary defense to prevent collapsed walls of the arteries and veins. Take 6 to 10 grams of vitamin C daily. Reduce the amount if you get diarrhea. Dr. Matthias Rath researched this data. Get his book, Why Animals do not have Heart A ttacks . Check the Int ernet. The proof has been established as well as it can be, certainly a hundred times better than the idea that cholesterol drugs will make you less likely to have a heart attack. A number of people have reported lowering their clogged arteries. No rep orts"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 23 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century of bad results from this. The body may be able to heal the arteries as fast as the cholesterol is removed. My opinion in this case would be to take a lot of vitamin C for a few weeks before using the MMS to clean out the chole sterol. Make sure the walls of the blood vessels are strong before removing the cholesterol. Read Dr. Matthias Rath’s books. A rare few people (2) have called to say that after starting MMS they notice heavy heart palpitations. Later t hey called back to say that the palpitations were gone. Who knows what caused that, but in my opinion if the bacteria that sometimes grows on the heart valve were to be killed it would probably cause palpitations for a while. All kn own diseases and negative medical conditions: I have not listed a great number of diseases which can be handled by the immune system in hours, days, or only a week or two, as there are so many. The MMS will probably help the immune system do its job no m atter what the disease. Diseases that are not caused by viruses , bacteria , and other various germs may not be attacked directly by the MMS, but the benefit may come indirectly. Almost any disease generates various poisons which in turn cause the body to be sick. When the immune system has chlorine dioxide which, of course, is furnished by the MMS it can often neutralize such poisons. Never assume that MMS will not improve the immune system no matter how weak of a condition the immune system might be in or no matter what disease may be present in the body. Take MMS daily or twice a week to keep the body clean of most poisons and disease causing organisms. Diseases that the immune system cannot help directly: The i mmune system can use the MMS to attack diseases caused by bacteria , viruses , parasites , fungus, yeast and molds , but many diseases are caused by other medical con ditions. Maybe this is the case, but since the first edition hundreds of people have reported almost every medical condition known as having been improved. Examples of diseases that do not respond to MMS are, well, maybe NONE. Some diseases need to be han dled by the proper diet. The immune system, when supplied with MMS, almost always produces some improvement in these diseases and their associated conditions. Everyone who has reported having lupus and also reported taking the MMS has also reported feel ing back to normal. Much diabetes that has reported taking the MMS has also reported doing better, and most have reported all symptoms gone. Even those with depression have reported feeling better. One child with ADD has reported all symptoms were gone in two weeks. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 24 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century There is much benefit from improving the immune system as these diseases often cause weakened conditions and weaken the immune system as well. Bacteria and virus have a tendency to attack in weakened areas of the body. Pneumonia, for exa mple, is more likely to attack when the body is weakened. With MMS the immune system can fight back and often overcome the infections or other conditions that have been caused by the weakened condition. This can in turn help other diseases to clear up. For those people who would like to overcome any bad condition not caused by bacteria or viruses , the book Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M. D. can give you many important insights into the causes of such conditions and how to overcome them. Remember, chlorine dioxide is the most powerful killer of pathogens known to man . When used by the immune system, it is still the most powerful killer of pathogens and the most powerful detoxifier known. Two days of supplying the immune system with 22 drops a day of MMS can be as effective as 35 intravenous chelating drip treatments and more. (MMS can also be used intravenously either with drip or direct injection, see Chapter 13. I would suggest that chela ting clinics use MMS with IV ’s as they can then be of real benefit. ) MMS is not a chelating solution. MMS is or to be more correct, the chlorine dioxide generated by MMS is an oxidizer. It oxidizes the heavy metals and poisons instead of c helating them. I say all this with only the best intention. I have plenty of axes to grind, but I do not do this for any other reason than mankind must have this amazing Miracle Mineral Supplement. I am not selling anything. (Well maybe this book, but a ny profit will go towards helping the people of Africa overcome the diseases there.) I tell everyone exactly how to make MMS in their own kitchen . I even suggest places that you can buy the chemical and I give complet e details for you to make it. My only intention is to see that mankind gets the discovery. It is too important for me to have any other agenda. You can even make it and sell it on the Internet or to your neighbors. But more important, you can make it a nd save lives. Just follow the directions here and give it to anyone who has some terrible disease. You can be of help to many, many people. Look around you, there are always those who need it. You can help old people with their health problems and you ng people, too. If you sell it on the Internet, just don’t make any claims. If you give it to someone and they get well, you can tell that story on the Internet. I have from time to time been accused of treating diseases without a license. Some docto rs have climbed on their high horse and said that I was putting lives at risk. I have always answered that they have one hell of a nerve being"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 25 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century critical of simply giving a mineral solution that is not a drug. Any medical doctor is to some extent a part of the medical system. They either approve of Big PHARMA or they go along with them. Each year in the United States more than 975,000 people die of medical drug causes. More people die from that than any other cause of death. That’s 975,000 deaths that should not have occurred. When I mention medical drug causes I am talking about those who died because they were given the wrong drug in the hospital or a clinic. Others were given an overdose or those who had an ADR (adverse drug rea ction). There were also others who had a drug taken away too quickly, or who died from drug side effects (many). Why do you think that when they advertise a drug on TV that they required to mention the drug’s side effects. One of the things that they say is, “Serious or fatal reactions have occurred.” The fact is that the majority of drug deaths could have been prevented. Yet it continues year after year while the government agency (the FDA ) will spend millions st opping a health food item that might have caused one death. Drugs make money for the drug companies and for doctors. They (Medical people) feel that they must attack any item that might take the place of a drug and reduce their income. The government statistics agency has provided the causes of death in their statistics, giving 699,697 for heart disease and 553,251 a year for cancer . They do not mention one single death caused by medical prescription drugs and their statistical research shows none. When a person with cancer dies from being given the wrong drug, the government simply reports it as a cancer death. The drug death is included in the report, but not in the government statistics. Gary Nul l PhD who researched much of the report “Death by Medicine” was able to dig out the true statistics because the data is available and it cannot be suppressed. Refer to the references given at the end of this chapter. The people in the USA are spending b illions of dollars on medical treatments and we could have the best medical treatment on the planet, but it has not even come close. And then there are those doctors who are so scared they will lose revenue that they feel that they must attack the MMS. So let me say this. Since we are not talking about a drug, why attack it or me? Why not take a day or two and check it out? Try it. See if it works. It’s simple. Does it work or doesn’t it? Don’t take my word, or someone else’s word, try it yourself . As I mentioned previously, the entire country of Haiti would now be malaria free if medical doctors had not put a stop to our work there. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 26 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Warnings: (1) Do not allow children to use MMS unsupervised. (2) Do not allow MMS to set in direct sunlight even if it is in a colored bottle as it will create pressure in the container which could rupture and cause severe burns. MMS that has set in direct sunlight can cause very painful burns. (3) Never allow full strength MMS to remain on your skin for more than 2 0 seconds as it can cause mild burns. In the case of a brown recluse spider bite , use only diaper rash ointment (Desitin) or other diaper rash ointment containing at leas t 40% zinc oxide. I mention this as some people have tried to use MMS for brown recluse spider bites and it had very little effect on the poison. Desitin contains 40% zinc oxide. It will kill most of the poison and reduce the pain and itching of a brown recluse spider bite in less than one day. I say this after seeing dozens of people treat their bite with this diaper rash ointment. Black Widow bites : As long as we are talking about spider bites let me mention a remedy for Bl ack Widow bites. Slice open a stem of freshly cut Aloe Vera leaf and put the open slice part against the bite. Use a piece about two inches by two inches. Then tape the Aloe Vera leaf over the bite with tape holding it tight against the bite and excludi ng most of the air. Leave it for at least 12 hours before putting a fresh piece on the bite. Most or all of the bite poison will be gone in 12 hours. Insect bites, mosquitoes and other bugs not particul arly poisonous but irritating. A really heavy mosquito bite can be very uncomfortable for several hours. Use MMS as if you were going to drink it. Put 10 drops in a glass and add a full teaspoon of citric acid . Wait three minutes ; then put the solution full strength (just the drops and vinegar ) directly on the bite. Rub it in with the tips of your fingers. The itching from the bite will be gone in about 5 minutes and the bump will begin to diminish immediately . You do not need to wash this solution off. Once you have added the vinegar to the MMS you have negated its ability to burn your skin. Once vinegar has been added the alkalinity of the solution has been destroyed. However, when usi ng the solution in larger areas of the body than a small insect bite always add about 1/2 cup of water to the 10 - drop solution that you make mix . Using MMS on the Outside of the Body : Please read this carefully. It is poss ible to cause problems on the outside of the body when using MMS in too strong of a solution. When adding six to ten drops in a glass with ½ teaspoon of citric acid solution with the exception of insect bites in a small area of the b ody, always add over ½ glass of water before putting on the outside of the body or in the hair. Never add the 10 drops mixture to any kind of body lotion. When the MMS solution is too strong on the outside of the body, it can weaken the cells and make t hem more susceptible to bacteria and"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 27 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century infection . On the other hand, when used in a weak enough solution, like adding the ½ glass of water, it can help a great deal. For jock itch and that sort of thing, after apply ing some body lotion then spread the solution of MMS from the ½ glass of water with your finger tips. Sores on the head : Follow the instructions for the insect bites above, but be sure to add ½ glass of water to the 10 - drop so lution of MMS citric acid or lemon juice. When combed into the hair with enough solution to penetrate to the scalp it will cure most head sores in a few hours. If you use it daily it will make a healthy scalp, but it also makes you a blond. In other words once or twice a month is okay, but when used daily you begin to notice that your hair is bleaching blond after a few days. (It is a very nice blond.) However if you rinse it out in 2 to 5 minutes it will not blea ch at all and it will keep your scalp very healthy. Prevention : Information has already been presented that MMS improves the immune system. The fact is that the MMS is a super preventative for almost any disease known. It’s my opin ion, after observing hundreds of people taking MMS; it will prevent most cancer , including breast cancer. But not just cancer, any disease that the immune system can attack can be prevented or aided in prevention by supercharging the imm une system with MMS. I would appreciate email letters from anyone noticing information concerning all aspect of the MMS, either pro or con. Note: If you cannot afford health insurance, you definitely should be taking MMS every day. When your problem d oesn’t clear up right away: Many people call and say, “I’ve been taking 12 drops twice a day for weeks, but when I go to 14 drops I have diarrhea badly.” I always reply that chlorine dioxide is the strongest oxidizer known. And that is all it is. It onl y oxidizes and nothing else. So if your body has a lot of unhealthy gunk deposited in critical areas that is making you sick, or if it has poisons such as heavy metals deposited, or if there is a heavy load of bacteria growing somewher e, or any other unhealthy condition it will continue to work on that stuff day after day. After all, you are only using a few drops each day, and those few drops only contain a couple of milligrams of chlorine dioxide. You may have thousands of times mor e stuff that needs to be oxidized than a few drops can handle, but it is working on it. And the fact that you get sick or have diarrhea when you take a heavier dose proves that it is oxidizing the stuff and your body can only throw off a certain amount ea ch day. If you give it more to throw off than it can do without getting violent, then it will get violent. Just keep the dose up just under the nausea level. You will finally get there, but know that it is working as long as it makes y ou sick when you take too much. When it quits making you sick, you will be well. Some diseases allow much heavier loads of"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 28 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century bacteria and virus. It can take a while. Don’t get discouraged, keep at it. Bird Flu, Pandemic and other Mass Hysteria : For over 100 years chlorine dioxide has been used to sterilize hospital floors, benches, and equipment, and to purify water, and for sterilizing meat. During that time no pathogen has ever developed any kind o f a successful resistance to chlorine dioxide. Due to the nature of chlorine dioxide it is doubtful that any pathogen ever will. Several doctors have mentioned that the very nature of microorganisms’ structure eliminates the possibility of ever developin g a resistance to the oxidizing powers of chlorine dioxide. It’s like trying to develop a resistance to hand grenades or dynamite. The explosion is too violent to resist. It is doubtful that any of these new mass hysteria or germ warfare diseases will b e able to resist chlorine dioxide, that is to say, MMS. Chlorine dioxide was used to kill Anthrax during the 2001 Anthrax attack. Now anyone can use it in the body as well. Be sure to keep some present in your medicine cabinet . One other point, you can bet that the pharmaceutical companies will soon find an inoculation for bird flu. They will then want to inoculate everyone in the world, especially in the U.S. They will say they want to save us, but all they really want is to make billions of dollars. Diabetes , ALS, and many other diseases of which they claim they don’t know the cause: There are a number of viruses that might be considered exotic. They really aren’t, but unless you are a doctor you won’t hear much about them, but you should, because they are abundantly present. The Coxsackie B virus, according to much of the present medical literature, causes up to 1/3 of the heart attacks. It causes the heart to become inflamed. The heart doesn’t work very well when inflamed. It is also reported that this virus causes the pancreas to become inflamed thus causing type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When MMS is taken it has a tendency to lend the i mmune system some ammunition. Killing the Coxsackie B could cause the heart to palpitate for a short while. Go slow and take small doses. Then for ALS (Lou Gehrig disease) there is medical literature indicating the echo virus – 6 and – 7 is most likely the cause. If that is so, then there is a chance that MMS can help cases of ALS. In which cases I would start at one or two drops every two hours and increase the number of drops up to 6 to 8 drops every two hours for as long as one is awake and up out of bed using, of course, the citric acid activator and three minute wait before adding the juice or water and drinking the solution. The idea is to keep the body as saturated as possible with the chlorine dioxid e. Of course there is no guarantee, but up to this time there has never been even a slight glimmer of hope. If you are diagnosed with ALS you have 2 to 5 years and that’s all. They had stuff that they claimed slowed it down a bit, and of course, they go t a lot of money for"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 29 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century it, but there never was any real data indicating the ALS was slowed down. Trying MMS just may work. Nothing else does. So it’s worth a try. Curing diseases with drugs . Can it be done? No. The only thing that ever heals the body is the various mechanisms of the body. Healing is controlled by the body. NO drug or no nutrient can heal the body. NOT ONE! There are things that the body can use to aid in the healing, but in the final analysis, the body always does the healing. Drugs occasionally help the process, but normally the body needs nutrients instead of poisons, which all drugs are to a greater or lesser extent. MMS is the same. It cannot heal or cure the body of anyt hing. It may or may not kill pathogens in the body without the body’s control. However, once the germs or pathogens or poisons are destroyed, healing can take place at a much faster rate. This is why healing in so many parts of the body seems to happen so much quicker. It is not that the MMS has healed anything. It cannot. But it can clear the way for healing to take place. Overcoming cancer and many other terrible diseases. Be sure to read this paragraph . MMS seems to be effective against most diseases, but some diseases require much more MMS than others. Normally the answer is if you are not getting improvement, take more MMS. This means that you should start off with 2 drops, using the lime or vinegar or citric acid and the 3 minute wait as always then add juice or water and drink. Continue to increase the number of drops twice a day, if you can. Go to 3 drops, then 4 drops, then 6 drops and s o on until you reach 15. Stay at 15 drops a day for several days, and then do it twice a day. Then, if you do not notice improvements increase the number of drops. Always reduce the number of drops if you feel nausea , but continue to i ncrease the number of drops, keeping below the nausea level as much as you can. Increase up to 20, or 25, or even as much as 30 drops twice a day, for a serious condition. Be very careful. If you feel nausea , reduce the number of drops. Do not remain at high, 20 - 30 drop levels unless you really see an improvement in the condition you are trying to handle. When the condition is overcome, be sure to drop back to only 6 drops a day for maintenance. However, if you do get nausea , vomiting or diarrhea do not be worried. Many times the body needs to get rid of something. Many times a health expert or doctor may advise you that you need to get yourself cleaned out. Well, if you need it, the MMS is going to do it. It’s no t a bad sign. Antidote for too much MMS : For someone who has taken a large dose of MMS and is then nauseous , it is possible to drink a glass of cold water which may handle the nausea . If not handled add 1000 to even 5000 MG of vitamin C ."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 30 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Bicarbonate of soda also acts as an antidote. Use a level teaspoon full of bicarbonate or take an Alka - Seltzer tablet in a glass of water. If you us the vitamin C do not us e the bicarbonate of soda or Alka - Seltzer. Use either one but not both. Overdose of sodium chlorite : Anyone who has consumed more than ½ teaspoon of the miracle mineral should immediately begin drinking water, as mu ch as possible. It is possible to drink as much as several tablespoons of MMS right straight from the bottle, but this would make one very sick. If this occurs begin to drink as much water as possible. It is best to add ½ teaspoon full of bicarbonate of soda to each glass of water. Be sure to see a doctor or emergency poison clinic and explain you have taken sodium chlorite solution. Training : You have read this book and hopefully you now know how to use the MMS. BUT if you make up some MMS for others, YOU must train people to use it properly. Do not expect that you can rely only on the directions on the bottle. No, no, no and no! People must be trained to use the MMS. If you give someone a bottle, sit down with them and actu ally do a training session. Have them drop two to six drops of MMS in an empty glass, add 5 drops of lemon , lime or citric acid solution for each drop of MMS that they use. Wait three minutes, add ½ glass of apple juice , then you drink a dose and have them drink a dose. Please, believe me, this is the only way it works. People must be shown. In the past eight years every mistake in the world has been made, a nd many of the mistakes simply keep it from working. I already told you about the lady that took 30 drops the first time. She was sick for three days. I told one other lady that she must put six drops in an empty glass and add ½ teaspoon of vinegar , wait three minutes and add ½ grass of apple juice . She promptly went home and added six drops of MMS to ½ cup of full strength vinegar. She later told me that before she finished drinking that ½ cup of vinegar sweat was running off her forehead and down her neck. The vinegar got in her eyes and she could barely see. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Some prepared it the night before (never allow more than ½ hour between mixing it and drinking it), and some tried it in their coffee (never do this). Almost no one gets it right without at least one session of training. It’s too simple. Everyone expects it to be more complex. So please, please, train each person to whom y ou sell or give a bottle to. Not to do so means you are asking for failure and it is unfair to them. Also, don’t think that most people will be able to do it right and only a few will fail. Not so! Most will fail, in one way or another, if not trained.

Follow the instructions and you can save lives and watch people get better. Benefits that happen with in th e body when someone takes MMS. These are the things that I have observed over the past 10 years. Some of it is my opinion; however, I have discussed all of the following information with medical doctors who have agreed with me. But then, some of that wa s their opinion as well. So this is what appears to be happening in the body when MMS is ingested after using the various activators listed in this chapter. The first thing that the MMS does is destroy anaerobic microorganisms including viruses , bacteria , fungus, molds , yeast , and parasites . These are the disease causing organisms. There are many reasons to believe that this is what happens. This generally hap pens between 4 hours and 4 weeks, but in less than one week in most cases. This includes all forms of infection and other microorganisms. Also blood diseases such as leukemia. Secondly , the MMS oxidizes the heavy metals within the b ody. I believe this because there have been a number of tests where the hair roots were checked before and after taking MMS. Afterwards, the heavy metals were gone. That includes mercury , lead, and several other metals. Unfortunately , hair root testing is not totally accurate, but it is a good indication. Oxidation of the heavy metals is not the same process as chelating, but the results are the same. When a heavy metal is oxidized it is neutralized and is simply washed out of the body. Thirdly , the MMS is carried throughout the body and where it neutralizes foreign matter that is generally poisonous to the body. When oxidized, these poisons are neutralized and merely wash out of the body. Almost all poisonous material will be acidic in nature, thus it allows the MMS to recognize it. These poisons will all be attached at various locations and they will be hindering the function of the body. As they are oxidized they will no longer stay attached and will be wa shed out of the body. Fourth , most forms of poisons from snakes and other venomous animals are oxidized when adequate amounts of MMS are taken. Most food poisons found in restaurants or in your refrigerator are oxidized, which is why one should take a nu mber of doses when feeling the effects of food poisoning. Fifth , the poison generated in burns, particularly type 3 burns when covered"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 32 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century immediately with MMS, or even within hours, is neutralized by the MMS.

For empty bottles if you make your own see that last part of chapter 17. For emergency use today, you could buy a bottle of Stabilized Oxygen from a local health food store. Make sure it is made from sodium chlorite. Normally Stabilized Oxygen is 1/8 strength of MMS. So when the instructions in this book call for starting w ith 2 drops of MMS, you will need 16 drops of the Stabilized Oxygen. For treating any kind of a condition you will need to reach 120 drops a day. Don’t forget the lemon or citric acid , or vinegar activator . The bottle isn’t going to last very long. For just maintenance to keep your immune system up and in good shape you will need at least 48 drops a day. It still isn’t going to last long as most such bottles are one ounce o r less. Buy MMS from Canada or one of the other suppliers listed on the MMS Web Page for $20 a bottle. It will last you two years if you use a 6 drop maintenance dose twice a week.

Here is something your doctor will never tell you, there has been a medical test for cancer that is 99% effective for more than 25 years. It is more effective, less dangerous and cheaper than all other medical cancer tests. It’s called AMAS cancer test. You don’t have to go to a doctor; the test is available on the Internet.

That is, if you start out at say one drop or even 1/2 drop and it does not make you nauseous and then you begin to increa se the drops twice a day once in the morning and once in the evening. That is if 1/2 drop doesn't make you nauseous in the morning, then in the evening or late afternoon try one full drop. Then the next morning take two drops and in the evening 3 drops. Sooner or later the number of drops is going to make you nauseous. You then take a drop or two less the next dose for a time or two and continue to increase the drops. You are always looking for the nauseous point, taking less for a time or two and atte mpting to take more."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 34 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century You will be able to know if it is going to help you if you can continue to pass the nausea point and increase the drops. What is happening is that when nausea hits, some of the cancer has been destr oyed and it is now a poison that the body can clear out. Being able to clear out this poison is a part of it. The body can clear this poison out but it might generate some nausea in the process, or diarrhea or even vomiting. That’s not bad. The idea i s that as the cancer is destroyed the body must clean out the poisons. As the cancer is destroyed the body can tolerate more and more drops. That’s the indicator, is the body being able to tolerate more and more drops? If you find that you finally can i ncrease the drops without getting nauseous it is an indicator that the body is doing its job. In the case of cancer, you have got to work at it. You start out slowly but increase quickly. At first you might just take the drops twice a day, but as you find you can do it twice a day without nausea, then increase to three times a day, and then four, and even as much as five times a day. Also, if say, 5 drops are making you nauseous try 4 or 3 drops and, if say, 3 drops does not make you nauseous go to 3 drops but take 3 drops as many times a day as possible. As soon as you can tolerate 4 drops then go to 4 drops several times a day. Keep increasing the drops as fast as you can tolerate them. What would indicate that y ou are not getting well is if the body got nauseous every time you take a dose no matter what amount of dose it is, and the body never seems to be able to increase the doses without nausea . If you can take say two dro ps at a time without nausea and you get nausea when you go to three drops, you may have to tolerate the nausea for a short time, but if the nausea always occurs when you take three drops, it shows that you are not gaining on the cancer . That can happen if the cancer is growing faster than the MMS is killing it. There is, however, always hope. One way would be instead of increasing the number of drops, increase the number of times that you take drops during the day. Read below. There ar e other items that can help. Never, however, in any case stop taking the MMS. So if there is an indication that one is not improving, then I suggest the following direction. Purchase some Indian Herb from Kathleen in Texas. It costs $60 a vial and that i s plenty. Phone 806 647 - 1741 she has a thousand letters from people who have been helped. She and her father"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 35 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century have been selling the Indian herb for over 60 years. When you get this herb use it with the MMS to get the best results. The AMAS cancer test listed above gives anyone a fantastic advantage. One can do a test, use the MMS for several weeks or a month and then do a second test to see how much improvement has taken place or to see if any improvement has happened at all. When I men tion drops of MMS I always mean add 5 times that many drops of lemon , lime , or citric acid solution, wait three minutes and then add 1/3 to 2/3 glasses of water or juice and drink. Never use MMS witho ut the addition of lemon, lime, or citric acid or in an emergency if you have no citric acids, use vinegar . Use only apple , grape , cranberry or pineapple juice without added vitamin C or ascorbic acid or see #6 below for overcoming the taste. End Cancer Protocol. 2. The Standard MMS Protocol also for children The health of you mouth is ex tremely important. Please see the first part of this chapter under the heading “How to use MMS for personal Health” if you are serious about getting well you must follow the data give there. Note: When following the instructions below, keep this paragrap h in mind. Always activate the MMS drops with one of the food acids, either lemon juice drops, or lime juice drops, or citric acid solution drops (to make citric acid solution add 1 level tablespoon o f citric acid and 9 tablespoons of water. Store it in a bottle with a lid.) Always use 5 drops of one of these food acids to each one drop of MMS, mix in an empty dry glass and wait at least 3 minutes, then add 1/3 to 2/3 glasses of water or juice and drin k. (You can expand the 3 minutes out to 10 minutes, and after adding the juice or water you can wait up to an hour before drinking.) 1. All protocol for taking MMS in the Americas starts with one or two drops. Never start with more than one or two drops. P eople who are very sick and/or sensitive should start with ½ drop. Activate the drops as given above. 2. If you do OK and do not notice nausea on the first dose, increase by one drop for the second dose. If you notice nausea reduces the a mount of"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 36 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century MMS for the next dose. Do two doses a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. Continue to increase by one drop each time you take a new dose. When you notice nausea, reduce the dose by one drop, or bad diarrhea reduce by 2 or 3 drops. Usua lly reduce for one or two times before going back the amount that it took to make you nauseous . Note: If you notice diarrhea or even vomiting that is not a bad sign. The body is simply throwing off poisons and cleaning itself out. Every one says that they feel much better after the diarrhea. You do not have to take any medicine for the diarrhea. It will go away as fast as it came. It will not last. It is not real diarrhea as the body is just cleaning out, and it is not caused by bacteria or virus. When the poison is gone, the diarrhea is gone. 3. Continue to follow the procedure given in 2 above. Until you reach 15 drops twice a day without nausea . At that point increase to 3 times a day. Stay at 3 tim es a day for at least one week and then reduce the drops to 4 or to 6 drops a day for older people and 4 to 6 drops twice a week for younger people.   . Note: Once you have completed step 3 above most of the viral, bacteria , mold , and yeast load will be gone from your body. Your body will be clean. You no longer have to worry about feeding the microorganism load. You can base you diet on nutrition, rathe r than not feeding the load. The diabetes will be gone, thus you no longer need to worry about sugar. You won't have to worry about the pancreas over reacting thus giving you a shock of insulin. Instead it will give you just enough insulin to knock the blo od sugar lever to the right level (You won't feel sleepy after eating a candy bar). Your body will then be able to easily adsorb vitamins and minerals and many other nutrients it might have been missing up to this time. You should feel better as time goes by. Do not quit taking the MMS. For Children: The protocol for children is essentially the same. One should usually start at 1/2 drop. Just make a one drop drink and pour out 1/2 of the drink before giving it to the child. Then increase from 1 to 2 to 3 drops as given above, but do not go beyond 3 drops for each 25 pounds (11.4 kg) of body weight. With a baby start with 1/2 drop and increase to one drop up to 2 drops, but no more. So if you give 1/2 drop in the morning wait until the aft ernoon before giving 1 drop and then the next"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 37 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century morning for 2 drops. If the baby or child becomes nauseous wait an extra hour or two before giving another dose and also give a smaller dose. Give smaller doses until the baby or child can t olerate more, but do not stop giving doses. End Standard Protocol. 3. Clara's 6 and 6 Protocol The health of your mouth is extremely important. Please see the first part of this chapter under the heading “How to use MMS for personal Health” if you are serious about getting well you must follow the data give n there. For people who have pain, flu, colds, pneumonia, or other diseases that are not generally considered incurable and physical pains that have been present for some time. When people are very sick and in bed they should use the standard protocol #2 above and start out with a tiny dose. I've named this new protocol Clara's because she was the first to really apply it consistently. You may have read the last ch apter in the second edition of this book. You will recall that there were a number of success stories about Clara treating people in her home. Since then I have rented an office from Clara and her mother, I have seen quite a few more people come in. Last night 12/14/07 a lady about 65 years old and her husband arrived to buy some MMS and Clara always gives them a 6 drop dose, has them wait one hour, and then she has them mix the next dose to make sure that they have it right. Then she has them wait a few minutes up to an hour before they leave.   . Both the right hand and the right foot of the lady that came in last night were completely paralyzed . She came in with a walker but she could not hold on to the walk er so her husband had to hold her to the walker. It was a chore getting in the door. Clara gave her a 6 drop dose with 30 drops of citric acid as the activator , she waited the 3 minutes as always and then added 1/2 glass of water and handed it to the lady. The lady lifted the glass with some difficultly to her mouth with her left hand as her sciatica (lower back pain) was also paining her. Within 40 minutes she was starting to feel a reduct ion of pain in her back and some tingling in her hand. At 60 minutes she could slightly move several fingers. Clara handed her another 6 drop identical drink. As we waited for the second hour to pass, Clara called me in from the office. The lady was"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 38 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century ex ercising her hand. She had complete mobility in her hand and she had her shoe off and was exercising her toes. In fact she was exercising her entire foot and she could move her toes and other muscles better than most people I know. When she left, she wa s still using the walker, but her husband didn't have to help her and her lower back pain was gone. I could see that she would be walking without that walker in a few days. This is not unusual. It happens around here all the time.  So this is \"Clara's 6 and 6 protocol\" using MMS. It is simple. It's for most conditions such as flu, colds, pneumonia, physical pains either immediate or chronic, and most other home sicknesses. Step No. 1. Put 6 drops of MMS in a glass and add 30 drop s of 10% solution of citric acid , or 30 drops of lemon juice, or 30 drops of lime juice. Shake the glass so that the acid and MMS are mixed and wait at least 3 minutes. A little longer is OK in case you walked away and forgot. 10 or 15 minutes would be OK as the solution remains at about the same strength. Then add about 1/2 glass of water to the solution and drink. You can also use a juice that does not have added vitamin C . U se apple juice , grape juice, pineapple juice, or cranberry juice. . Step No. 2. Wait one hour and do exactly the same thing as in step No. 1. Normally the person will experience some relief within two hours of taking the first dose especially if he goes ahead and takes the second dose. Of course, here is no guarantee. If the person does or does not experience relief he should go to 7 and 7 th at is a 7 drop dose and in one hour a second 7 drop dose, but he should do this only if he did not get sick. By getting sick I'd mean that he was nauseous for more than 10 minutes or he vomited, or he had diarrhea. In the case he did ge t sick you should not increase to 7 and 7, but rather again do 6 and 6. If he was very sick it would be best to drop back more, such as 3 and 3, but that seldom happens. Normally do 6 and 6 until one can tolerate it without being nauseous, and then begin increasing to 7 and 7, etc. For flu and pneumonia and bad colds and other diseases that can be life threatening do this same process two or even three times a day until you are feeling well. Do not give the flu a chance to get a foot hold . . "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 39 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Once the flu is gone, one should begin increasing drops towards 15 and 15 or you could revert to the Standard protocol as given above and increase as quickly as reasonable to 15 drops and then increase to 15 drops twice a day or 3 times a day for one we ek as explained below. The general goal of the number of drops that anyone should take is 15 drops 2 or 3 times a day and of course, less for children . For children normally it would be 3 drops for each 25 pounds (11.4 KG) of body weig ht. This number of drops, 15, would be OK twice a day for a grown up that weighed 150 pounds (68.1 KG) or less and 15 drops three times a day for a grown up weighing over 150 pounds. This is not an exact number. One should evaluate his own case and how h e feels to decide the number of drops. This number of drops pretty well ensures that one's body is completely free of pathogenic microorganisms and heavy metals. Once one has reached this goal for a week, he should drop back to a maintenance level of one 6 drop dose twice a week. (In all cases when drops of MMS are mentioned we also mean that 5 drops of lemon , or lime , or citric solution is added for each 1 drop of MMS and one then waits 3 minutes before adding water or j uice and consuming it.)     . Of course, the goal of it all is not being sick. So take 6 drops twice a week. If you feel the flu coming on, then do the Clara 6 and 6 protocols as described above. You will have the flu for no more that 12 to 24 hours and usually less than 6 hours after taking your 2nd dose. However, never give the flu a chance. The best way to kill the flu is to take 2 or three drops every hour all day long until you know the flu is gone. The 6 drops twice a week keeps your immune system strong and the pathogens weak. You probably remember from school that there are always pathogens in your body. The 6 drops keeps them at bay. End Clara’s Protocol. Special Note by the Author: It’s be en mention elsewhere in this book; I did not invent this technology. If you will go to chapter 22 you will see that Chlorine Dioxide has been used in the body by many others for a period of 20 years or more. I merely brought it to the public when it woul d never have been brought otherwise. Over a period of 12 years, I have had a more widely and diverse experience with it than any other person. I admit that I thought at first that I was the inventor. I did invent it, but I was the second or third invent or, or maybe even tenth inventor."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Curing Diseases  Chapter 10  Page 40 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Others were already using it on a very limited basis, and for many years. I carried it on over a much wider area to the public. So anybody who wants to say that I was not the first inventor, I will have to agree with the m. I don’t know who invented the use of chlorine dioxide in the human body. The area is clouded as it has been used for many years by many different researchers. And sodium chlorite has been used by hundreds of researchers in the body without ever reali zing that they were actually using chlorine dioxide. It may be that none of them realized it was chlorine dioxide the one causing the results that they were getting. In each case their research was limited to only several diseases or several types of dis eases. So as far as patents are concerned I could not claim first use and thus could not obtain a patent. (Of course, I did not want and do not want a patent). All I ever wanted was to see this Miracle Mineral used throughout the world and that is indee d happening. "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Treating Burns  Chapter 11 Page 41 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century C hapter 11 Treating burns The MMS solution has an amazing ability to treat burns. There is some kind of a chemical created in a burn that is neutralized by MMS. A burn is best treated by M MS immediately after the burn, but it can still help even hours later. When a burn happens, no matter how bad, one should squirt the MMS full strength straight out of the bottle all over the burn. Do not use the vinegar in this ca se. Using the tips of your fingers, very lightly with a feather touch make sure it is spread completely on the burn. LET I T REMAIN THERE for only 30 seconds to a minute. Do not allow your fingers to press on the burn in any way. If you had a paint brus h handy, that would be best. But don’t spend any time looking for a paint brush. The sooner you get the MMS on the burn the better. The acidic chemical in the burn is neutralized by the alkaline solution of the MMS. The pain stops immediately, within se conds. Wash the MMS off with water . When treating a burn, make sure you leave it on for at least 30 seconds. Count slowly to 30 before washing it off. You absolutely must wash it off or the burn will become worse . If you do this correctly, the burn wi ll heal in about ¼ the ordinary time for a similar untreated burn. You may need to treat the burn two or three times or more. The MMS must be washed off with water within 30 to 60 seconds. If water is not available do not use the MMS until you are sure that something is available to wash the burn off. Any drinkable liquid will do for washing the MMS off of the burn if there is no water available. Sunburns can also be treated. Use a cloth very lightly or with the tips of your finge rs very lightly spread the MMS full strength on the sunbu rned area. Use plenty of the MMS so that it spread s quickly and easily. Leave the MMS on for 30 to 60 seconds and then rinse off with water. It must be rinsed off completely. Do not leave it on. Waiting more than about 5 minutes will make it worse. If you rinse it off, the pain vanishes immediately. If you have a hard time following directions or if you cannot understand “Wash it off” please do not attempt this action. It must be rinsed off of the burn within 5 minutes . MMS is a miracle with burns when used right. It will stop the pain and save lives, and make the burn heal much faster, but if you do it wrong, (in other words if you don’t wash it off) it only makes it worse.

Well those umbrellas don ’ t keep the reflected sun from burning you, and he was burned very badly. Unfortunately, he did not come back from the beach that day, so I was not able to treat him until the next day. I put full strength MMS into a two ounce spray bottle and sprayed his body everywhere there was red areas. The red covered most of his body. We left it on for one minute and then he showered. When he c ame out of the shower he said, “ I can ’ t tell you how much better that feels. He was flexing his shoulders and other muscles where he could not flex before without much pain. After several hours he complained that much of the pain was back. I sprayed his complete body again, but this time we made sure that there was complete contact by very lightly rubbing the solution on with finger tips and then he waited 5 minutes before taking the shower. This time when he came out of the shower he said that all the pain was gone and this time the pain did not return .

I can’t prove that at this time, but I believe it. The thing that kills older people is a poor immune system. As you get older, your immune s ystem goes bad. MMS changes that. When one is taking the MMS on a regular basis his immune system becomes supercharged. There is little to nothing that can get by the immune system in that case. Our dark field microscope has shown that the longer one continues to use the MMS the more supercharged the immune system becomes as far as white blood cells are concerned. After treating hundreds of people for six years, it is my opinion that no disease known to man that is caused by pathogens (viruses , bacteria , parasites or other micro organisms) can withstand an immune system being treated daily with MMS. One might need to increase dosing on occasions when the flu season is e xtremely bad or other diseases are around. The body seems to recognize flu bugs. For a person taking the MMS it then tends to react as it always has when flu hits, except for one thing: The reaction usually lasts less than 24 hours, and on rare occasio ns as much as 48 hours. The flu is 1/10 as severe as when one is not taking the MMS. Most diseases will never occur, but some do show up as a mini disease that is gone in hours. Colds come and are fully active, but they are usually gone in an hour or tw o. When taking the MMS as a maintenance dose the diseases that usually kill older people simply won’t get to you. However, it will be your job to keep yourself in good condition otherwise. If you remain a couch potato, you will probably still last a lit tle longer, but nature’s old rule, “If you don’t use it, you lose it” will probably always be in play. The MMS gives you the tools to live a great deal longer, but it will be up to you to make that happen. That includes taking other nutrients. When the MMS kills off the pathogens your body is still going to need the proper nutrition to remain healthy. That means the proper balance of vitamins, minerals, proteins, and oils. Old age is normally a mass of deficiencies of "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"MMS and Longevity  Chapter 12 Page 44 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century various nutr ients. The MMS kills off the diseases and neutralizes the poisons, but the deficiencies can kill you all by themselves. Staying young or just remaining alive, you got to work at it.  "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"MMS Intravenously  Chapter 13 Page 45 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Chapter 13 MMS Intravenously There is more data to report this time concerning using MMS intravenously (IV ). You may or may not be aware that up to several months ago no one had ever used MMS by IV after being activated by citric acid or vinegar or any other acid. Although a hundred thousand infusions of sodium chlorite had been done in hospitals and clinics throughout the world only raw inactivated sodium chlorite solution had ever been used. Of course that was because no one has ever thought to activate it during those times. After talking to many lyme disease victims who were not getting well by simply taking MMS by mouth and after talking to a few who had not notice much help even by IV I bega n to feel really worried. Also I talked to several people who were not getting very much results with morgellans disease and that worried me even more. If these two diseases cannot be cured, then curing all the other diseases is not going to be enough. There are literally millions of people who have these two diseases and the number is rapidly approaching epidemic proportions. The public doesn’t hear about this because it is simply being either ignored or suppressed. Thousands of people have either e mailed me or talked to me on the phone. I get reports from a cross section of the US and the world. We can’t ignore these diseases and the dozens of similar diseases that are all traceable back to government laboratories in the world. If we do, they wil l kill us. Most people are not worried at this time except for those who get the diseases or when a loved one gets a disease. Some people think that they must be bitten by a tick, but not so. There are many ways to get these diseases. Most people repor t no tick bite. So based on the fact that something has got to be done I started thinking about using MMS IV after activating it with one of the food acids. As you have already learned this creates up to 1000 times more chlorine dioxide tha n inactivated MMS. Of course we know the tremendous advantage this gives us when taking MMS by mouth but the diseases that don’t seem to clear up by mouth are lyme and morgellans disease and other “created” diseases. I reasoned that norma lly the activated MMS had to travel into the digestive system and thus get into the blood in the stomach walls. The chlorine dioxide there is picked up by the red blood cells in the stomach lining and carried thought the body. The question that kept comi ng to me was, “That’s good for "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"MMS Intravenously  Chapter 13 Page 46 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century the red blood cells, but what about the blood plasma?” The plasma is the liquid that carries the red blood cells around. Does the chlorine dioxide also somehow get into the blood plasma from the stomach, because if it doesn ’t, that could be one reason why the MMS doesn’t seem to be doing the job with lyme and morgellans diseases. Well, I had to find the answer to that question, or at least to the question: “Will MMS be more effective by IV if it is activat ed? ” I couldn’t afford to have tests does with lab rats thus I decided to go ahead and be the lab rat. I talked it over with Dr. Romero and he was dubious about me doing the tests but when I said that I would do it anyway, at home if necessary, he agreed to watch over the tests, because he knew I wasn’t kidding. I hired a nurse who could do IV work and we started tests a few days before Christmas 2007. The question was, would I get the same reactions by activated IV as we get by mouth, or would it be something different. I hoped it would be different, because if it was the same, then doing activated IV might be the same also and thus not much improvement. Making a long story short as I can, I finally tried 1 drop of MMS activated with 2.5 drops of 10% citric acid solution in 150 ml of saline IV solution. Well the first thing that happened was nothing, and that was strange as several doctors had said that the citric acid would burn like th e devil in my veins. But there was no burning or other feeling except for the needle prick going in. There was nothing! I began to be disappointed, but who could expect something from one drop, not even fully activated (I used 2.5 drops of acid instead of the normal 5 drops. That’s actually equivalent to ½ drop of MMS). An hour passed and I decided to go home. Then on the way home, at about 1.5 hours after the infusion, it hit me. I began to get colder and colder and then began to shiver. I was fre ezing and also experiencing nausea . I was sick, but quite elated. Something different was happening and this had never happened before. I called my friend Dr. Hesselink , who wrote Chapter 22 in this book and wh o has been doing oxygen therapy for many years and he assured me that it had to be a Herxheimer reaction. (That’s a reaction as the result of destroying something in the body that releases a poison.) That could only be because the chlorine dioxide is goin g deeper into the body tissues. I had been taking 30 drops of MMS with absolutely no results, so the activated IV had to be going deeper to destroy further microorganisms in order to make the Herxheimer reaction. So I continued. The same amount of activated MMS didn’t create any reaction the next day. So I tried activation with 5 drops food acid and 1 drop MMS. I again got the Herxheimer reaction and when I did it again, the reaction did"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"MMS Intravenously  Chapter 13 Page 47 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century not occur. I continued this way until I got to 4 drops. Each time getting the reaction on the first increase and then not getting it the second increase. I was amazed that there never was the slightest bit of pain in my veins, but I did have a pain in the back of my hand when the needle was not put in correctly. Then Christmas came and there was too much activity. I had to stop. Then at the first of February I began to do the tests again. I started and went to 4 drops much quicker this time and then a standard thing that often happens, a body surviv al mechanism kicked in and my veins started knotting up and refusing the solution. There are standard ways of overcoming this mechanism, but we did not have any of the drugs required. So I again stopped until the drug can be obtained. I later found that the drugs that prevent the veins from knotting up are Heparin and Procaine. Don ’ t use them until you know exactly how much to use. And that leaves us at this point. I may have to publish this book before we have the answer, but my opinion at this time is that it will probably have a very good effect on lyme and morgellans and might even kill them. If the chlorine dioxide is getting to where they are hiding, it is going to kill them. It is already proven that chlorine dioxide kills the diseases, it’s just that these laboratory generated diseases seem to be able to hide in places that antibiotics and MMS by mouth cannot reach. There is one other thing you should know. One lady that has had lyme extremely bad and terrib le sick decided without my knowledge to use MMS activated by IV . She mixed up 16 drops with 75 drops of food acid. She waited the three minutes and put it in 200 ml of saline solution. Then a nurse friend did the infusion for her in an hou r’s period of time. She became very sick the next day. The skin on her face, which had become very old and wrinkled looking, completely peeled off, leaving her face looking very young again. The lyme had apparently infiltrated her skin and when killed i t also killed the skin as well. So she took 4 times as much activated MMS as I did and she lived through it. In fact she felt much better, but the lyme was not gone. However that was only one treatment, who knows how much good continued treatments would have done. By the way, even that much food acid did not cause pain in her veins. This lady then went back and did two more infusions of 16 drops with the added 75 drops of citric acid solution in the 200 ml bag of IV solution. This time she became quite sick again. She had diarrhea, nausea , and vomiting. Then most of the rest of the skin pealed from her body. It was extremely painful, but she felt much better when the ordeal was over. I would ne ver suggest this course of action. It’s dangerous and not necessary in my opinion."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"MMS Intravenously  Chapter 13 Page 48 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century One should start at low levels of MMS and increase slowly to 16 drops or more. So you see, my evaluation that MMS activated and intravenous will probably kill the disease s is based on this lady’s results as well as what I learned about myself. So I’m just reporting the continued research at zero money. It needs to be done. It’s not the way things should be done, but then we wouldn’t even have MMS if things were done the way that they are supposed to be done. Please understand, I’m not bragging or complaining or anything else. I just feel that the public should know what our great government and other great rich and wealthy philanthropists are not doing nor helping with . I have often asked them for help. I hope you understand. The lyme and the morgellans disease are increasing throughout the world. There are many diseases with names I can’t pronounce and many diseases not yet named. It started in t he US and has spread throughout Europe, Asia, and most of the other countries. It is far worse than most people realize. Something has to be able to control it. I’m not the only person out here saying this, there are many others. I don’t want to say it . I don’t want to be considered a kook. I don’t want to be a hero. I’d rather go prospecting in the jungle as that gives me the most pleasure. But as the saying goes, somebody’s got to do it. Well, we will soon see. In the mean time read the rest of this chapter. It tells what has already been done by IV . Twenty ml push method. MMS has been used intravenously with faster results than by mouth. Six to 18 drops of MMS in 20 milliliters of sterile injection solution bo ught from a pharmacy in a foreign country for injection purposes was used. It was a glucose solution. The injections were done in the veins of the arms . The injections must be fast at about 20 seconds for the 20 ml solution. The reason is if you do it too slow it burns the vein, so get it in fast. The injections were done one or two per day for up to three days. More days might be okay, but that is all we d id. All injections were done under a doctor’s supervision by nurses . Do not try this yourself or without a doctor. Using the push described here 25 people were treated who claimed to have AIDS . Five people called back and said that they checked negative for AIDS.

Seven drops of MMS in a bottle of 250 ml of gluc ose drip solution was used for the first treatment and 22 drops of MMS was used in a bottle of 250 ml of glucose drip solution the second treatment the same day and continued at 22 drops for up to 30 days in a row. The drip speed was adjusted for about tw o hours for the full 250 ML. The results were spectacular. All drip solutions were done by nurses familiar with the process under doctors ’ advice . Do not try this. Keep a blood pressure machine handy with many tests at the very beginning. If the blood pressure drops more than 20% stop the action. Give fruit juice to bring up the pressure. If you are using saline solution change to glucose solution to keep the blood pressure up. The blood in the veins and drip solution itself acts as a neutral solutio n which adjusts the alkalinity of the MMS downwards, thus causing it to begin releasing chlorine dioxide. It is carried throughout the body getting to places that it would not otherwise get. After adding the MMS we always waited 1 hour before beginning t he process. The reason for this was to allow some chlorine dioxide to be generated. When using IV the drops should always be adjusted to the maximum amount of drops without causing the patient to be sick. A normal person does not become sick with 22 drops of MMS in a glucose 250 ML IV solution. Normally, an AIDS patient will become very sick at this level of drops. Thus one should start with 2 to 5 drops and increase by a couple drops each treatment. Should the patient become nauseous during the treatment or immediately after, on the next treatment one should use 2 drops less. Then begin increasing the drops until the patient can take 22 drops without becoming nauseous. Continue at 22 drops increasi ng to 22 drops twice a day until the patient tests negative for AIDS. At any time the patient becomes nauseous the treatment should be stopped immediately for that treatment . But do not stop the treatments. Just use a couple drops less the next treatmen t. A couple of doctors have suggested that one never use more than 250 ml of solution at a time. It may cause the lungs to take only water if using more ml in an infusion. Thousands of infusions have been done with sodium chlorite at the same strength a s given here without problems. Remember, no food acids were use in any of these infusions. You must know what you are doing. Be very careful to not get any air into the injection tubing as air in the veins can kill a person. Nausea is not a bad sign. It indicates the MMS is working. But if the patient feels really bad, he can drink a glass of water to which 1000 MG of vitamin C has been added.

Chlorine dioxide is a gas that is dissolved in water when in the body. Chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been used as disinfectants for more than a hundred years and there is little doubt that they simply destroy pathogens of all kinds. Both have been used in water purification systems for more than 50 years. In recent years, in water purification systems chlorine has been used less and chlorine dioxide a great deal more as it has many benefits over chlorine. Chlorine dioxide is used extensively in water purification systems throughout Europe. Although chlorine dioxide is somewhat more expensive than chlorine, its many benefits over chlorine has resulted in it being more extensively used in water purification systems than chlorine. In 1998 The American Chemical Society, Analytical Chemistry Division said chlorine dioxide is the most powerful antimicrobial agent known to man. Chlorine dioxide kills pathogens by oxidation, a completely different chemical reaction than that of chlorine (chlorination) and oxidation results in no harmful chemicals. A 10 - ppm drink of chlorine in juice will cause a healthy person seve ral hours of nausea , while a 10 - ppm drink of chlorine dioxide causes no nausea at all for a healthy person, and yet it is more efficient in killing pathogens than chlorine. None of the functions or elements of the human body including friendly aerobic bacteria are affected by chlorine dioxide in diluted solutions of 50 - ppm or less. On the other hand, solutions of 0.1 to 1 - ppm seem to induce a spectacular immune response reaction attacking anaerobic bacterium, viruse s , parasites , fungus , harmful molds , yeasts and other pathogens . Without realizing it, hundreds of thousands of Americans have been drinking diluted solutions of chlorine dioxid e for more than 100 years in various health waters sold to the public. Diluted solutions of salt treated with electricity have been sold as “health water” under various names such as “Willard Water” which is still being sold. Most of these waters contain low levels of chlorine dioxide as a result of the electrolytic treatment. The chlorine dioxide concentration in such water was very low and thus was never strong enough to do a thorough job of killing pathogens in the body, however the benefits claimed fo r these health waters were more than likely caused by the chlorine dioxide as there is no other element in the water that would seem beneficial. Other health drinks have been sold that contain various chlorine derivatives. Stabilized Oxygen"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Chlorine Dioxide and Blood Chemistry Chapter 14 Page 52 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century which is a dil uted solution of sodium chlorite when diluted further with water very slowly gives off chlorine dioxide. The MMS is just a stronger solution to which a food grade acid has been added. The acid such as vinegar or citric acid often used in soft drinks reduces the solution to an acid condition but still within a food range which releases up to 1 ppm chlorine dioxide, a level of concentration that is sometimes found in processed food but is 100’s of times that which is produced in Stabilized Oxygen. Because of the acetic acid in the vinegar , or citric acid , when added to a sodium chlorite solution, the solution begins to release chlorine dioxide on a line ar timed basis for up to 12 hours. Stomach acid does not tend to significantly change this timed release. The amount of salts and vinegar or citric acid is calculated to release one milligram of chlorine dioxide per hour. An hour is the amount of time t hat it takes one milligram of chlorine dioxide to deteriorate into table salt and other harmless chemicals plus one very useful chemical. The production of chlorine dioxide and its constant deterioration into table salt and chemicals brings about a lessening level of chlorine dioxide in the body for approximately 12 hours at which time all chlorine dioxides deteriorate leaving no trace and nothing that is deleterious to the body. Thus the poison index after that period of time is zero . Hospitals and laboratories have used chlorine and chlorine dioxide for more than a hundred years as a disinfectant for cleaning floors, benches, and tools. No pathogen can resist them and no disease, either bacterial or virus has ever developed a resis tance to chlorine dioxide. The human body has very few mechanisms that can differentiate between oxygen and chlorine dioxide. Since red blood cells cannot tell the difference, strong evidence indicates as the MMS enters the stomach, absorption mechanisms in the stomach walls allow the red blood cells to absorb the chlorine dioxide and carry it to various areas of the body where oxygen ions are normally taken. The natural pH of the human body is approximately 7. At pH 7 chlorine dioxide, in the absence of light, is fairly stable for a few minutes. However, disease pathogens are essentially all anaerobic and have a different fingerprint than that of friendly aerobic bacteria as do malaria parasites . As mentioned above, the red blood cells readily absorb the chlorine dioxide and once in the cell they attack the malaria parasite because the surface of the parasite has a lower pH than the blood. Chlorine dioxid e is an extremely high explosive and it is so volatile that it cannot be transported. The only way that chlorine dioxide can be utilized is for it to be generated on site and used as it is generated, or generated in situ (in pl ace). It is the volatile nature of chlorine dioxide when it contacts pathogen that makes it so effective both in water systems and within the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Chlorine Dioxide and Blood Chemistry Chapter 14 Page 53 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century human body. As doctor Hesselink has pointed out in chapter 22 of this book, the very nature of the malaria parasite prevents it from ever developing a resistance to chlorine dioxide. However, we also believe that the volatility of chlorine dioxide also helps prevents pathogens from developing a resistance to it. It’s sort of like trying to develop a resistance to hand grenades. You just can’t do it. Normal levels of oxygen in the blood cannot destroy all of the pathogens present under disease conditions, however, when chlorine dioxide is adsorbed with t he oxygen it is a different story. When a chlorine dioxide ion contacts a harmful pathogen it instantly accepts five electrons from the pathogen, or it might be more descriptive to say that it instantly tears off five electrons. An extremely fast chemica l reaction is in essence an explosion, and this is exactly what happens on a microscopic level. The damage to the pathogen is a result of losing electrons to the chlorine dioxide ion and the release of energy. The pathogen, basically, is oxidized by chlor ine ions and as a part of the action the chlorine becomes a harmless chloride (table salt ). Two atoms of oxygen are released as ions from the chlorine dioxide ion but the oxygen has little effect ot her than to attach to hydrogen ions making water or attach to a carbon ion to make carbon dioxide. It is the process of the chlorine dioxide ion oxidizing pathogens or other harmful chemicals that is beneficial to the body. Although the two oxygen ions of the chlorine dioxide ion are released, their charge level does not result in oxidation. The same process continues throughout the body where chlorine dioxide ions contact pathogens. It does not attack beneficial bacte ria or healthy body parts, as their pH is not below 7. It will also oxidize diseased cells, such as infections or cancer . In the event that the chlorine dioxide does not contact a pathogen or other poison, it deterio rates into table salt and hypochlorous acid that is useable by the body. A scientific paper published on the Web by Lenntech Company (see the end of this chapter) explains the oxidation reaction strength of chlorine dioxide as oppose d to many other oxidizers. Chlorine dioxide is the weakest oxidizer of them all. However it has the greatest oxidation capacity of all the oxidizers with the ability to accept 5 electrons. Ozone as a comparison is the stronge st oxidizer of them all and oxidizes everything in its path that is capable of being oxidized, but it can accept only 3 electrons. Chlorine dioxide being a very weak oxidizer oxidizes only microorganisms, heavy metals, and diseased body cells that are easi ly oxidized. It does not have the oxidation strength (electron potential) strong enough to oxidize healthy body cells, or aerobic beneficial bacteria . However, when contacting items within its oxidation potential range, it has the abi lity to accept more electrons that any of the other oxidizers, and thus it is extremely effective. "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Chlorine Dioxide and Blood Chemistry Chapter 14 Page 54 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century The lymph nodes, for example, are one of the areas where the blood normally releases oxygen to oxidize various poisons in the node and then it carries the o xidized poisons away to the liver. The red blood cells carry the chlorine dioxide ions the same as oxygen and thus chlorine dioxide ions are also released in the lymph nodes. The chlorine dioxide ions are inert to normal cells but they wi ll destroy disease pathogens found there. A minute amount of naturally produced chlorine dioxide is found in the human body and one of the chemicals that chlorine dioxide helps to create as it deteriorates is myeloperoxidase a chemica l that the immune system needs. The immune system uses this chemical, myeloperoxidase, to generate hypochlorous acid. The body uses hypochlorous acid extensively to kill parasites , bacteria , fungi, viruses , tumor cells, natural killer cells, and to destroy some waste products under normal conditions. However, diseases and body conditions can result in a deficiency in the hypochlorous acid needed to destroy the pathogens that a re present. This is due to a medical condition known as myeloperoxidase deficiency. In the case of many other diseases there are other immune system reactions that can overcome the diseases, however in the cases of malaria and other ext reme diseases, there is not enough hypochlorous acid to kill the parasites or pathogens, nor are there any other immune system reactions that can destroy them. Thus the hypochlorous acid created by chlorine dioxide as it deteriorates in the body is probab ly another mechanism by which malaria and other diseases are destroyed. In the case of the MMS, when taken by mouth by a malaria victim after adding vinegar and juice, all malaria symptoms including chills, fever , aching muscles and joints, headache, nausea , and other symptoms are gone within four hours in 98% of all cases. The other 2% are symptom free within 12 hours. Although some malaria victims are sick from other diseases, we have never found a case in which the malaria parasite was not destroyed. To this date, July 1, 2006, more than 75,000 malaria victims have been treated with no serious side effects reported. Since normally two deaths per each 250 - m alaria victims is expected, and zero deaths were reported in the 75,000 cases treated, we must assume that 300 lives have been saved and that the MMS is doing its job. In February of 2006 clinical trials were conducted in a prison in the country of Malawi East Africa . The results were a 100% cure rate of all malaria victims treated in the prison. Several months later , in the same year , the Malawi government made its own separate clinical trials. They reported with the same results.

The remaining 40% were judged free of AIDS in four to 30 days. Most of the AIDS victims treated were those that were sent home from the local hospital to die as the hospital could do nothing for them. Unfortunately, AIDS blood tests could not be made as the money and facilities were not available, however, all victims were known AIDS victims and the majority went back to work or to their lives with no AIDS symptoms left.

MMS consists of 28% sodium chlorite p owder dissolved in distilled water. (Since Sodium chlorite powder is only 80% sodium chlorite and cannot be manufactured any more pure than that, the actual percentage of sodium chlorite in MMS is 22.4 %.) (When mixing use 28% sodium chlorite powder by w eight and 72% distilled water). Sodium chlorite powder is 80% sodium chlorite and 19% is table salt (sodium chloride ) and less than 1% of several other sodium chemicals that are considered nontoxic. Be careful her e. Do you see why a 28% sodium chlorite powder mixture is only 22.4% actual sodium chlorite? If you don’t, read it again. The powder is only 80% sodium chlorite. The characteristics of sodium chlorite are important. It is a hazardous material for the purpose of shipping. It comes in white or slightly yellow flakes. A hundred pounds is shipped in a metal drum 14 inches in diameter, and 27 inches high. Smaller amounts usually come in plastic jars. It can cause fires if it contacts organic materials a nd a spark. 2. A maintenance dose of MMS is six drops from the green bottle with the white bottle cap as given in Chapter 10. All drops mentioned in this book and on this page are drops as given in Chapter 10. 3. A full dose to overcome diseases is 15 to 18 drops from the green bottle with the white bottle cap, also shown in chapter 10. For disease normally a full dose is given twice within two hours each day until the disease is gone. See protocols at the end of chapter 10. 4. When using Stabilized Oxygen at the standard 3.5% to make MMS (using vinegar ), use eight times the number of drops as is specified in the various recipes listed in this book. If you are using a standard eye dropper as shown in Chapter 10 use 12 times the n umber of drops as is specified in the various recipes listed in this book. 5. One drop of MMS contains nine milligrams of sodium chlorite 6. When 6 drops are mixed with ½ teaspoon of vinegar in a dry clean glass, one milligram of chlo rine dioxide will be generated in three minutes. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Overview of the use of MMS and Main Points Chapter 15 Page 57 The Mir acle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century The solution will not become much stronger than one milligram as the chlorine dioxide near the surface of the liquid goes into the air. You can make it stronger by putting a lid on the solution preventing much of the chlorine from escaping. 7. When ½ glass of apple juice , grape juice, or pineapple juice is added to the mixture given in number 6 above, and the drink is consumed , o ne milligram of chlorine dioxide will be generated each hour for approximately 12 hours within the human body. 8. Chlorine dioxide , generated by MMS, is the most powerful killer known to man of microorganisms, such as, viruses , bacteria , parasite, molds and yeasts. Chlorine dioxide has been known and used for over 100 years as a sterilizer for hundreds of uses in hospitals and the food industry. No other chemical or drug has an equal effect. Adding vinegar to sodium chlorite creates the same power to kill microorganisms in the body. 9. Do not allow MMS to set in direct sunlight . It creates high pressure and has been known to blow t he lid off. The liquid after contacting sunlight becomes very strong and will create burns if not washed off immediately. In the case of contact with eyes , flush with water for several minutes. 10. Any dose of MMS requires ¼ to ½ teaspo on of vinegar or citric acid with the exception of intravenous use. Without vinegar or citric there is very little benefit. Normally, do not use vinegar or citric when used intravenously. The blood will accomplis h what the vinegar would do otherwise, but it does it more slowly. 11. Any vinegar is okay to use, but must be 5 - 6% acetic acid . 12. Any sodium chlorite for use in laboratory or for use in water treatment for humans is acceptable for making MMS . (When using 15 drops and then adding juice to drink, the amount of impurities in 15 drops is insignificant when considering the maximum allowable daily impurities that might be allowed for a human being to consume.) 1 3. Sodium chlorite is used throughout the world to generate chlorine dioxide for water purification , for bleaching of paper pulp, for bleaching of cotton, and hundreds of other uses in industry.

Sodium chlorite was fi rst used for treatment of humans in 1926 at Germany by Dr. William F. Koch, MD, Ph.D. It has been use in the U. S. since 1930. 15. Since 1926 it has been considered by those who use sodium chlorite that it is Stabilized Oxygen and that it furnishes oxyg en to various parts of the body. That is a mistaken idea. No useable oxygen is available from sodium chlorite. But Chlorine dioxide is also an oxidizer. It is a weaker oxidizer than oxygen and cannot oxidize health body cell s, but equal quantities as oxygen can oxidize a much greater amount of material that can be oxidized. 16. Vitamin C that is used in juices as a preservative will completely prevent the MMS from working. Do not use juices from off the s helf unless you are sure no vitamin C has been added. Some pure apple juices do not have added vitamin C. The natural vitamin C in juices is not a problem. 17. Orange juice will prevent MMS from working. It prevents the chlorine dioxide from being generated. 18. Apple juice, cranberry juice, grape juice, and pineapple juice are okay to add to the MMS drink after the three minute wa it if the juices have not had vitamin C added. The best idea is to use fresh juices that you know do not have vitamin C added. Most other juices prevent the MMS action that is necessary. Very few manufacturers do no t use vitamin C as a preservative. Read the label very carefully. If vitamin C has been added do not use the juice. 19. Shelf life, if the bottle has not set in the direct sunlight , is two to four years if the bottle is dark glass o r plastic. Clear glass or plastic is okay for a short period of one or two days. If the bottle sets in the direct sunlight it will last only about an hour even when if it is in dark glass or plastic. 20. Full strength MMS is alkaline at a pH of 13. It can cause a slight burn if not washed off of the skin in less than a minute. Flush with water. When vinegar is added to the drops of MMS the pH is then 4.5. When apple juice is added after thre e minutes the pH matches the apple juice exactly, which is approximately 4.8. The other juices mentioned in this book are similar. Use only apple juice, grape juice, pineapple juice, or cranberry juice that has not had extra vitamin C added. 21. MMS can be used to purify water. Use 4 drops per gallon when in the jungle or in the woods. Wait 8 hours after adding the drops.

The gallon of water with activate d MMS is safe in less than an hour. 22. Sodium chlorite powder is hazardous. It cannot be allowed to come into contact with heat and organic materials at the same time. It can causes fires. The liquid made from the powder is not hazardous, but if it i s allowed to dry out and become a powder again it will be hazardous. See chapter 17 for information on buying sodium chlorite.

That should last you and your family for a couple of years. MMS is light sensitive so you must bottle it in a very dark glass or plastic bottle, or in dark opaque plastic. Dark green, blue, or brown transp arent plastic is okay. The light that goes through these dark colors will not harm the MMS. Don’t worry about the MMS being out in the daylight for a couple of days. However, never allow it to set in the direct sunlight . Sunlight w ill ruin it in an hour even when it’s in a dark plastic bottle. The reason that we use 12.6 ounces is because that’s how many ounces of MMS 100 grams of sodium chlorite will make. The reason for that is 100 grams of sodium chlorite is the easiest amount that you can purchase. Many chemical supply houses sell 100 grams for about $30. Five or six pounds can be purchased at laboratory chemical supply shops for $300, but if you are serious bulk quantities of 100 pound barrels sell for about $275 to $700 at different industrial chemical companies. (See Chapter 15 for data on buying sodium chlorite.) An update from a reader tells me that a 110 pound barrel sells for $224.40 at the Los Angeles Chemical company. But they have a $300 minimum thus he bought two barrels. However, if worse comes to worse, and you really need to do something immediately to cure some problem or you just want to prove it works there will certainly be at least one health food store near you that carries Stabilized Oxygen. Buy some of that and use eight times as many drops as is given in this book as a dose. The dose that they suggest on the bottle isn’t enough to cure a mouse. (Or if you just want some MMS exactly to my formula and don’t want to fool around, buy a bottle from my fri end in Canada, it’s just $20 for a bottle that will last you for 2 years. See the end of Chapter 8). Or see my Web Site miraclemineral.org for a number of suppliers in the US. If you are using a regular eye dropper then the drops are much smaller than from the bottle mentioned in this book so you should use at least 16 times the drops given in the instructions in this book. (That is if you are using the standard 3.5%, Stabilized Oxygen from the health food store ) . I hope you understand that MMS at 28% plus is 8 times stronger than the Stabilized Oxygen however, they also provide a standard dropper with small drops so "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"How to Make MMS in Your Kitchen Chapter 16 Page 61 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century use 12 drops of Stabilized Oxygen for each single drop of MMS that you would use. Do everything else told here, that is add the vinegar or citric acid or Lemon or lime wait 3 minutes, add apple juice and drink. The bottle is gone in a week or two. On the other hand, expect most diseases to b e cured in that amount of time. Also keep in mind that there are a few groups that sell Stabilized Oxygen that isn’t really Stabilized Oxygen, but rather some other chemical that they think is better than sodium chlorite. Do not expect other chemicals to work, because they will not. In the last several years different companies have offered various strengths of sodium chlorite solution thus making different strengths of Stabilized Oxygen. One group sells it at 25% which is close to the MMS which is 28%. If you did get the 25% strength it would be okay to just use all of the recipes and drops as given in this book. See the end chapter 1 7 for directions on how to find and buy sodium chlorite and also see chapter 17. It’s harder to get now - a - days because of the terrorist problem. What you will need to make 12.6 ounces of MMS : 1. You will need at least a 15 ounce bottle. It can be clear plastic if you do not intend to keep the liquid in the bottle for more than a couple of days. This is OK if you ar e waiting to transfer the liquid to dark bottles or containers. Just be sure that you do not leave the liquid MMS in the clear bottle. You could actually get away with leaving it in a clear bottle if you kept the clear bottle in a closed tight cabinet. Don’t leave it in a refrigerator as refrigerators are opened to the light too often. 2. At least one quart of distilled water . Do not use any other kind of water. It’s okay to used purified water if it says, “For all distilled water purposes.” Do not us e spring water of mineral water unless it is an emergency and you can’t wait. 3. A plastic pitcher that has a good pouring spout. 4. A one quart pan or larger that can be heated. Do not use metal including stainless steel . Use glass or Co rning Ware or a new Teflon coated pot that does not have any scratches through to the metal. 5. Some kind of fairly accurate gram scales . Should be accurate to 1/10 gram. An electronic postal scale will do. Postal spring scales would"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"How to Make MMS in Your Kitchen Chapter 16 Page 62 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century be okay if you had so me accurate weights to adjust the scale with just before you use it. 6. A black marking pen . Be sure you have one on hand. 7. Some small bottles to put the MMS solution in after you make it . Many pharmacies have small brown bottles with droppers. It’s oka y to use these bottles so long as you never allow the MMS solution to get up into the rubber bulb. If you tip the bottle over, remove the dropper and wash it out with water making sure the bulb is washed thoroughly. 8. You will need at least 100 grams of s odium chlorite . When buying this chemical make sure it is chlor ite that you are buying and not chlor ide . Chloride will not work. You will notice that the sodium chlorite comes in flakes, either white or slightly yellow. When buying sodium chlorite don’t tell them what you are using it for. Tell them it is for water purification tests. The first thing that they will tell you is that their chemicals are not for internal use. That is not something to wo rry about. That is what all the sources of sodium chlorite specify, even those that sell their chemicals for public water systems. Remember, when you add distilled water you are diluting the chemical. Then when you use only 12 drops and you dilute that w ith ½ glass of water or juice, any impurities are also diluted. By the time you have done that much dilution, the impurities are always way below the maximum allowable impurities per day that you can afford to put in your body. The sales people are alway s worried about being sued, so they will always try to talk you out of buying the chemical, or even refuse to sell it to you if you tell them what you are going to use it for. (See chapter 1 7 , second half of chapter, for information on buying sodium chlori te.) Checking the sodium chlorite powder to make sure it is real. I worry that someone might try to fool you into thinking some other powder is sodium chlorite in order to make you fail at curing someone, or just some clerk might be too dumb to sell you the correct powder. So here is how you check to make sure that you absolutely have the correct powder. First you must buy the strips that test for chlorine from any swimming pool store. Cost is $6.00 to $12.00 for 50 test strips. (1) When you open your package the sodium chlorite must be flaky. Several companies have sold sodium chlorite that is not flaky in the last couple of years. If there is no flakes assume that you do not have sodium chlorite, but go ahead and do the other steps given here. If the chemical passes the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"How to Make MMS in Your Kitchen Chapter 16 Page 63 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century following tests it is indeed sodium chlorite and they, for some reason, ground the flakes before you got it. (2) Crush up a few of the flakes into powder. (Do this by putting the flakes into a tablespoon and crushing with a second spoon). (3) Put ½ teaspoon of the crushed powder into an empty glass and add three level teaspoons of distilled water. Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved in the water. You could warm slightly to aid in dissolving or you could heat th e three teaspoons of water before adding to the powder. (4) Now drop 10 drops of this solution into an empty glass. Add ½ teaspoon of vinegar . Any vinegar will do as long as it says “5% acetic acid ” or “5% acid ity.” Wait three minutes. (5) Wet a pool chlorine strip with this solution. It should read at least 1 ppm chlorine present. It is actually reading chlorine dioxide (pool chlorine strips can’t tell the difference). (6) Now wet a second pool chlorine indi cator strip with the original solution from which you took the 10 drops. This solution should read no chlorine present (because you haven’t added the vinegar to that solution) or less strength than the above (5) test. If your powder fa ils either step 5 or step 6 you do not have sodium chlorite powder. Someone is fooling you or they have made a mistake. Run the test one more time to make sure. If it doesn’t pass the test, don’t use it. Don’t accuse anyone. Don’t upset anyone. Just ask for some real stuff. If your powder is okay, follow the steps given below . Making the MMS solution : The MMS solution is 28% sodium chlorite powder. The 100 grams is 28% of 357 grams. That is 12.6 ounces. If you buy a bottle of 100 grams, you sho uld just check that it indeed has 100 grams in it before adding it to the solution. One hundred grams is 3.54 ounces. Step 1: Verify that 100 grams or 3.54 ounces is contained in your bottle of sodium chlorite. Step 2 : Measure out nine ounces of dis tilled water and add it to your heating pot. Be very careful to get nine ounces exactly. Step 3 : Now dump the 3.54 ounces (the 100 grams) of sodium chlorite into the 9 ounces of water in the heating pot. The heating pot should not be on"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"How to Make MMS in Your Kitchen Chapter 16 Page 64 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century the fire yet. Put the heating pot on the hot plate and stir until dissolved. Once the whit e flakes or powder is dissolved immediately remove it from the fire. It should never be heated to the boiling point. It should only be warm when the sodium chlorite is finally d issolved. Never go away and leave it heating. It dissolves fast. Stay and stir until dissolved. Step 4 : The liquid should be yellow and clear. Pour into the pitcher and then use the pitcher to pour into your plastic container with a lid. Put the lid on and set aside to cool. Warning: when the MMS is spilled on a table or on the floor it must be cleaned up with plenty of water. Never allow it to dry. The white powder is very flammable when dry. Step 5 : Purchase a dark colored bottle or a number of small colored bottles and transfer from your original bottle if it is not a dark bottle. Make up labels with the data for use on them taken from the label at the end of chapter 17, and glue the labels on the bottles. You can use your computer for mak ing the labels. The MMS lasts for several years. It should have maximum data on the label for someone a couple of years from now who might want to use it. For example, if a hurricane damaged much of your home and help was days away, if the bottle had pr oper information it could be used to help you or save your life. If it was just a dark bottle with no label, no one would know to use it.

Be careful because we still get people who mistake sodium chlor ide for sodium chlor ite. They sound similar, but they are quite different, so use only sodium chlorite. Us e this same process duplicated exactly to produce 13 bottles or 1300 bottles. Bottling 13 plastic bottles that contain 5.5 oz Each of MMS Note: The MMS in a four ounce bottle actually weighs 5.5 ounces, because it is much heavier than water. Please do e verything exactly as I say. Once you have bottled 300 - 500, bottles then, if you must, change to what you consider a better way. But at first, do it my way. You are not playing. People’s lives can depend upon you doing it right. Read these instructio ns several times, and then read each step as you do it. There is data on plastic bottles at the end of this chapter. We ask, if you do your own bottles that you label them so that people can know what they are and how to use them. Someday there will be a bottle sitting on a shelf for several years and a sick person will look at it. If he knows how to use it, it may save his life. What you will need . Please get all the items that I mention here for the first 13 bottles which will contain 6,059 doses of MMS at six drops per dose. 1. One plastic temporary holding bottle is need for each group of 13 bottles you intend to make. Use 64 ounce juice bottles. Go to the store and buy at least two 64 ounce juice bottles. Dump the juice into some other contain ers and rinse the juice bottles out. Save these juice bottles to use over and over. Buy juice bottles that have easy hand holds. Do not try to use extra larger bottles, they are too hard to handle. 2. Enough distilled water for all the MMS that you a re going to make. You can use purified water if it says, “For all distilled water purposes.” Do not use any other kind of water. Do not use spring water or mineral water unless it is an extreme emergency. "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 66 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . 3. A plastic pitcher that has a small pouring sp out. Use the tall pitchers. Check the spout to see that it will pour into the MMS bottle easily. Or use a coffee maker glass pitcher for pouring the MMS into the bottles. If you intend to do more than 13 bottles then invest in a larger container such as one of the containers used to place a 5 gallon plastic jug upside down in to dispense drinking water. These containers have a valve at the bottom that works very well for filling the bottles. Do not use a funnel for pouring into the MMS bottle. It uses up too much time. Fill each bottle to the top. Do not leave any air room in the top of the bottle. This is so it won’t splash during shipping and worry the postal workers, or even worse the airline workers. 4. A four quart pan that can be heated to be used for dissolving the salts. Use only glass or Teflon coated steel . The Teflon coat must not be scratched through to metal. Do not use stainless steel or aluminum. You could make a poisonous MMS if you use metal for dissolving the Salts. That would be a disaster. If you use stainless steel you will notice that the MMS discolors the metal. That’s because it is dissolving the steel out of the other metals. Do not bottle such a solution. Corning Ware is also okay to use. 5. Fifte en four ounce colored empty bottles. Remember, it takes 5.5 ounces of MMS to fill a four ounce bottle. Use the flip spout caps. Tighten these caps hand tight only, but very hand tight. See further data. See the label at the end of this article and see data for ordering bottles at the end of this article. 6. Fifteen flip spout caps that fit the bottles. See data for ordering bottles. 7. Several super glue tubes. For gluing the lids on the MMS bottles. 8. A can of 3M Super 77 Multipurpose Adhesive bought from the hardware store for about 10 bucks. Do not buy any other adhesive. Do not buy any other 3M adhesive. If you do you will just make a mess and waste some bottles. 9. A can of Shellac. This is for spraying the labels to prevent problems in damp environments. This is necessary, otherwise in a few weeks or days the bottles become a mess. Spray the labels before they are cut out. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 67 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . 10. A cardboard box approximately two feet high. Cut a slot into the top of the box so that the MMS bottle will lie in the slot, but not fall through. Put a mark on the box near the top of the label where it will stick onto the bottle. This is so th at when you are putting labels on the bottles that you get most of them in approximately the same area of the bottle. 11. Thirteen labels. Make the labels on a computer, eight at a time on letter size paper (8 - 1/2 X 11) and cut them out with a razor kni fe and a straight edge. After you cut them out spray six labels at a time and stick them on. It takes less time than it takes to remove labels from their backing. Also it is very hard to find the right labels that your computer will print each label exa ctly in the center of the label. It’s much easier to just print 8 labels on a page and cut them out with a razor knife. Buy special paper for the labels. Get glossy paper from an office supply store, or order special labels, but ordering labels can be ex pensive. 12. A box of one quart freezer bags should be Zip Lock. 13. You will need one fairly accurate grams scale. Don’t use a cheap spring postal scale. Use a more expensive electronic postal scale or other accurate scale. It should be accurate to 1/10 gram. 14. You will need 632.8 grams (that’s 22.4 ounces or 1.4 pounds) of the sodium chlorite to make your 13 bottles of MMS. 15. A black marking pen. Be sure to have one on hand. Notice the freezer bags filled with sodium chlorite and the flip spout lids in the bowl . "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 68 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . The procedure: The MMS is 28% Salts by weight. The Salts ar e a powder that is dissolved in distilled water. So keep in mind that the MMS will be 28% Salts. This is what makes it so much heavier than water. Do not make a mistake here. People’s lives depend upon it. Just follow the instructions below and you wi ll get it right. Step 1 . Fill one freezer bag with 632.8grams of salts. (This is the point where you fill one bag for 13 four ounce bottles, or you fill more freezer bags for more bottles.) Zip the bag or bags closed and store in a clean dry place at r oom temperature. Mark on the bag(s) “632.8 Grams of Sodium Chlorite” and put the date. This is a temporary step, but who knows what might happen to make you forget what is in the bag. Step 2 . Measure out 1,627.2 grams of distilled water (that’s 57.6 oun ces) and put it in an empty juice bottle and mark the level with a black marking pen. (When this amount of water is added to 632.8 grams of standard 80% sodium chlorite salt you will have 80 ounces of MMS). If you are making more than 13 initial four oun ce bottles you will be using this same amount of distilled water for each group of 13 four ounce bottles. So once you have marked on the juice bottle, then use that juice bottle to fill your other juice bottles. Step 3 . Put the four quart nonmetal heat ing pan on the burner and pour the distilled water from one of the bottles in which you have 57.6 ounces of water into the pan. Do not let it boil. Keep the temperature well under boiling. One hundred fifty degrees is plenty hot. Step 4 . Once the wa ter is warm, dump the contents of one freezer bag made in Step 1 into the heating pan with the water. Stir it constantly until all of the salts are dissolved. The solution will be slightly yellow and foggy. This is normal. The pan will be less than ½ f ull. Remove the heating pan with the solution from the burner. This solution now weighs 80 ounces. The solution will turn clear but yellow within several minutes, but so long as all of the salts have been dissolved you can proceed to step 5. Step 5. Se t the 64 ounce juice bottle into a plastic container or another non metallic pan. Use the large funnel. Pour the contents of the heated pan into the 64 ounce juice bottle. Although the solution at this time weighs 80 ounces it will fit into one of the 6 4 ounce juice bottles. The additional pan is to prevent you from spilling the MMS. Keep in mind that if the MMS gets spilled it makes a mess. If it dries, it makes a white powder that will burn or"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 69 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . explode. There is not enough to cause damage from explo sion, but if it starts a fire there could be a lot of damage. Do not spill the MMS. If you spill it, wipe it up and then wash the spot with plenty of water. Step 6 . Write on the bottle “MMS” and the date created with the black marker pen. Leave room f or the next time you use the bottle. Remember, you cannot leave the MMS in the clear bottles for very long. Generally not longer than one week. The light, even just room light begins to deteriorate the solution in the bottles. This step is just a tempo rary step in the process of making MMS. Note: Do not put labels on empty bottles. Wait until the bottles are full and closed before adding labels, because any spilled solution ruins the label. Step 1. Take the 64 ounce MMS juice bottle and open it . Using the plastic pitcher with the small pour spout, or the coffee maker pitcher pour in enough MMS to fill about five MMS bottles. Don’t meas ure this; just pour it 1/4 full or so. Step 1A. Alternately, pour the entire contents of four or five 64 ounce MMS juice bottles that now have 80 ounce contents into the water cooler unit described in 16 above. Use the spigot to fill 12 to 20 green bott les. It’s best not to have more than that number of bottles without lids at one time. Step 3. Install tops on each of the green four ounce MMS bottles. Do this by holding each cap on its side and dropping 2 drops of super glue on the threads of the ca p and then turn the cap onto the bottle. Tighten the cap as The bottle is being filled from a coffee maker pitcher. Notice the clear but slightly yellow MMS liquid.

A towel works best, do not use pliers. After an hour, the caps should be impossible to remove by hand. Caps closed by using pliers usually are too tight and they begin to leak. Step 4. After the top is tightened on each bottle , grasp the bottle in your hand and squeeze it as hard as you can. Look for leaks. Drops of liquid will drop off the bottle normal ly if there is a leak. In rare cases a fine spray or stream might come off the bottom of the bottle. You need plenty of light to see the fine spray. Normally there will only be one or two leaking bottles per 100 bottles, but it is important that you fin d any leaks as one bottle can foul up an entire shipment. Step 5. Keep the bottles in a clean dry place. It is ok to keep bottles at normal room light but do not allow them to set in the sun. Step 6. Adding the Labels: (See “Making the Labels” below) T ake six labels and lay them face down on a sheet of newspaper. Spray the labels with 3M Super 77 adhesive. Don’t attempt to do more than six at a time as the adhesive tends to dry and if you use more than six the last labels will be too dry to stick. If they do dry, re - spray those that have dried before attempting to stick them on the bottles. Step 7. Place one of the filled bottles in the slot on the cardboard box that you have already prepared. (See item #9 under “What you will need” at the beginning of these instructions) Pick up a single label that has been sprayed with adhesive, hold it over the bottle near the mark that you have made, adjust it by eye to be straight, and press it down on the bottle. Smooth the label on the bottle with your hand. Be sure to smooth it down tight. Step 8. Do steps 7 and 8 on all of the bottles, doing six at a time. Step 9. Preparing the bottles to be shipped : Using a one quart plastic freezer storage bag, place two green MMS bottles in the bag laying them down in the bottom of the bag. Wrap the top of the bag around the two bottles, close the zip lock making sure it is tight, and place a rubber band around the bag and bottles to hold them in place. Now put the bottles in the bag into another bag and close it . If they leak in shipment the liquid will hopefully remain in one of the bags. Step 10. Do Step 9 until all bottles to be shipped are ready. This prevents problems of leaking bottles when shipping. A single leaking bottle can stop an"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 71 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . entire shipment pr eventing the treatment of hundreds of people. It could even result in the post office stopping future shipments. Be very careful. Step 11. Have them boxed for shipping . Unless you are very good at doing shipping, do not try to box them yourself. Ke ep in mind this shipment is of utmost importance. Don’t take chances. When at the shipping store don’t take chances to save money on the packaging. Have it done as best as possible. From the shipping store take the box to FedEx or DHL for shipping. M aking the Labels: 1. Most draw programs have provisions for making labels. Otherwise you can buy a cheap label program. Normally you would use the program to set up a single label as shown with this literature and then the label program will automatical ly make a number of labels depending upon the labels that you select. In this case select a label that has eight per page. That will give you approximately the correct size of label when cut out. Or duplicate the label given below. 2. Buy good paper. Pay $8 to $10 a ream. Don’t use photo paper. Photo paper is very expensive and not suitable as it is too thick. Buy a special paper at any office supply store that has a glossy surface, but is standard paper thickness. Print the labels on the computer. After the computer ink has dried, before you cut them out, spray them with shellac so that they are soaked, but spray them only once. 3. Cut them out with a razor knife using a ruler as a straight edge. Do not spray on the adhesive until after you cut out the labels. 4. An alternate method would be to have labels printed professionally . Buying the Bottles and Caps : When searching for plastic bottles the key words anywhere in the world are pet plastic bottle s. Pet really stands for polyethylene terephthalate, but no one ever uses the actual words. Everyone uses the words pet plastic bottles. So use pet plastic bottles for your search word and that will show you hundreds of companies sell plastic bottles. Be sure to always buy dark plastic as light will cause the solution to deteriorate. The plastic can be “seen through” so long as it is very dark."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 72 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . Dr. Ron Neer a (dentist) decided he wanted to do something to help spread MMS around the world so he found t hat the New York SKS Bottle Company was charging unreasonable prices to ship the bottles out of the country and then he found that he could get the bottles cheaper than SKS was selling them for and cheaper than any other place I could find. So below is hi s phone number and web site. Check him out. Remember one thing he sells both the bottle and the cap and his prices reflect bottle and cap. Any other bottle company will always list the price without the cap. These caps are important as they are an ap proved type for shipment by the Department of Transportation. The DOT states that the caps must have a seal so that the bottle won’t leak even if the cap comes loose. They are not more expensive; they are just built differently. So if you want to make s ome MMS no matter how many bottles you buy, you will find Dr. Ron has the best prices, but go ahead and check that out; just remember, the prices include both bottle and DOT approved cap. This is a dispensing cap from which you can count the drops. (The 4 ounce bottle holds 5.5 ounces of MMS because the MMS is heavier than water.) I have listed him here in my book because I want you to make MMS. I want you to have the experience. I want thousands of people to know how to do it and to be doing it.

The label printed above is just a suggested label that you could use. Notice how it is worded. Most of the sellers of MMS are now using this label. Buying larger amounts of sodium chlorite. It comes in 100 pound and 110 pound steel barrels. If you want to do a little more, like make up 100 four ounce bottles to sell and give to your family and neighbors, you will need at least 10 pounds. As you can see from the prices, buying a 100 p ound barrel will cost you less than trying to get 10 pounds. The problem is you need a company to buy 100 pound barrels as a general rule. Some of these companies listed on the Internet will sell to individuals. Of course, you can make up your own compa ny and that will work in many cases, but there are those companies that require your company state or city resale number. You might be able to find a local business that will receive the sodium chlorite for you and let you use their name for this purpose or just order it for you. Alternately, you could just buy a resale number from your city. Finding industrial sources for 100 pound drums is a little harder than buying lab supplies. Go to Google and put in “Drinking water chemicals,” or"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Making 13 or 1300 bottles of MMS Chapter 17 Page 74 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . “drinking water treatment chemicals.” Of course, use Google for the country you are in. Most countries will have sodium chlorite for water purification . Or look up NSF on the Internet or NSF/ANSI Standard 60. This is an association which many companies sell sodium chlorite. Just start calling the various companies that sell sodium chlorite for water purification. You will eventually find one that will sell you the 100 pound barrel between $250 and $400. Then it will cost you about $150 shipping because it is a hazardous chemical. But remember, with that barrel of 100 pounds you can make 186,000 doses. That is approximately 1/10 cent per dose depending on the amount you paid. At a last minute decision, on my way south to the first edit ion of this book, I managed to buy a 100 pound barrel of sodium chlorite from the Los Angeles Chemical Company of Los Angeles, California for the price of $278.00. The lowest price so far. I picked this barrel up at their Las Vegas division. Since I pic ked it up myself there was no shipping cost. They will not sell to an individual. You must be registered with them as a company. I formed a small company in a Nevada town and then called them to order a barrel. They put my company in their data base wh en I called them up. They then ordered the barrel for me and told me it would be available at their location in Las Vegas the next week. There was no problem. I paid for it with my personal credit card at the time I picked it up as I had not established credit with them. Buying Sodium Chlorite Further Data My suggestion is that you get an extra supply of sodium chlorite if it is at all possible. The government will be acting at the request of the drug companies to limit the sales of sodium chlorite. Once sodium chlorite swings into use as MMS it will eat into the profits of the drug companies. They will fight. They can’t win, but you can believe that they will try. You can help this program simply by buying 100 pounds and storing it. Buying sma ll amounts of sodium chlorite (100 grams up to 5 pounds). There are a few chemical supply companies that supply chemicals to chemistry students. These along with other chemical supply companies for laboratories are the easiest to do business with. Norm ally you can order over the Internet. Just use Google and put in “sodium chlorite”. Or if you just want Stabilized Oxygen put in Stabilized Oxygen. Or put in “laboratory chemicals” and “sodium chlorite.” The companies listed below are in the USA.

Chapter 18 The Humanitarian Project I will work with any humanitarian project anywhere that needs my help to bring about the goals listed below. If you have the where - with - all, please get in touch with me. The profit from this book will be spent as needed for distribution and any leftover will be spent for distribution of the MMS in Africa . A certain amount of humanitarian work has already been done, but it is not enough. It isn’t even a drop in the bucket. Much more has got to be done to change Africa and thus changes the world. Why change Africa ? The facts are the industrial nations spend untold billions of humanitarian dollars in Africa each year. It’s untold because no one knows how much, but it is tremendous. Go to any city in Africa and you will see numerous nonprofit NGO’s (Non Governmental Organizations) there spending money doing humanitarian work. The Red Cross is there, the World Health Organization, World Visio n, USAID, Doctors Without Borders, Global Fund, City of Hope, and dozens of others exist in almost every city in Africa. Why all the money spent? Why are they so far behind us? Africa is right on the equator. It is mostly warm and a very good environment for disease. Just malaria alone sickens 500,000,000 people each year. When people are sick, they can’t work. They can’t plant the crops, or harvest them when the time comes. They can’t build houses or produce wh eel barrows. In other words, with sickness, nothing much gets done. It isn’t that they are lazy, nor is it because they are uncivilized. It’s simple, w hen 500,000,000 people get sick, you have that many who can’t work, and it then requires almost that m any to take care of them. It takes much of the resources to just take care of those who are sick. When I was young I always heard that Africa was so far behind us because they weren’t civilized or because they are always fighting, or be cause they are lazy. But the fact is, as I stated in the above paragraph, when you are sick you simply can’t work. The situation is that their country has problems that the rest of the world has never had. As part of the human race it is our job to help them solve those problems. If you don’t feel sorry for them, that’s okay, and if you don’t feel responsible for them, that’s okay. But the fact is, we, as "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project Chapter 18 Page 77 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . part of the human race cannot afford to ignore them. The disease that will kill the entire human race may be fermenting there now. Or the man that saves the human race may be being born there now. One thing is certain; the human race cannot afford to not confront either of these possibilities. If the human race is to survive on this planet for any reasonable time, we cannot let any problem go unchecked. When you hear someone talking about any country or continent taking responsibility for their own situation, you should stop and think. We are the people of Planet Earth. It’s up to us to take resp onsibility for our own situation and that includes the fact that we must solve the African problem if we expect to feel safe at all. It’s amazing, but we can cure the majority of the poverty in the world merely by furnishing a cure for malaria . That won’t cure all of the poverty, but a whole lot of it. Then if we can cure AIDS , we will also cure a lot more poverty. This money that would then ordinarily would go to Africa could stay here to build a spac e program, or greater roads, or more training for our poor. And one more thing, if we treat all of Africa the human race will be taking one giant step towards survival. If we don’t work to help one another in this way, the human race will eventually cease to exist on this planet. Since this planet came into existence there has been more than 50 catastrophes that would have destroyed all of mankind had we been here when they happened. We are here now, and such a catastrophe is over du e to happen again. One of the places that the money that we will save when we don’t have to spend billions on Africa can go toward s preparing for the next catastrophe. If we don’t, the human race is condemned to extinction. The next catastrophe will happe n; there is no doubt of that. It’s impossible to think that it will not happen; it’s just when will it happen? It could easily be tomorrow, or it could be 25,000 years from now, but it will happen. If we are not ready, that’s the end of the human race. There are a lot of reasons to help those who really need it in the world, but probably the greatest reason is the benefit that the helper receives. When an individual has no reason for helping or aiding others, he is that way because he is solely inter ested in himself and his immediate family and goals. Do you see that not only narrows his play field and his interests, but it narrows his thinking. When hard times come, his thinking will still be narrowed. He won’t have the broad prospectus that might be required for survival. And that’s only a small part of it. When one begins to think about others the mental area in his mind broadens. His interests broaden his enjoyment of life"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project Chapter 18 Page 78 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . changes. He understands others better, and thus his life is easier be cause of it. A person who remains interested in only his family and his goals only knows his small area of the world. His world is very small. When he becomes interested in others and their problems his thinking broadens greatly. The world that exists within his mind expands. He has more data that he can include in his thinking and his problem solving. Life for him is better and life for humanity is a bit better because of his broadened outlook. This is a reason for helping mankind, and anything you do for others is helping mankind. Your life will be better because of anything you do in that arena. There is now little doubt that the MMS can cure most of African diseases. Once the diseases have been mostly cured, Africa will need to be put to work including those in the small villages. I have talked to a number of chiefs and other leaders and they have agreed that the work plan I have and one that I used in Orange County California back in 1956 will mostly work in Africa. Implemen tation will cost, but the program will eventually pay for itself and make money and it will put Africa to work. Anyone wanting to know more about this program please contact me. If you still don’t believe in the MMS, give it a try. Buy some Stabilized O xygen sold at thousands of places and follow the instructions in this book. If it scares you to take it, try giving it to your dog first. It won’t hurt him and you will have more confidence in taking it or giving it. Just remember, his body is smaller th an yours, so give him a smaller proportion. If he weighs 1/10th as much as you, give him 1/10th the amount you would take. But regardless of how you test it out, please do it. You just might be the one that makes the difference, and the life you save may be your own. I suggest that you buy at least one bottle from one of the suppliers listed on the MMS Web Site miraclemineral.org it’s only $20 and it will last you a year . My friend in Canada at www.health4alli nfo.ca has agreed to furnish enough MMS to treat a whole country in Africa . He will furnish it as needed in any Africa country that will accept it. The only problem is, he cannot also furnish the money to distribute it to the African country. We need someone to step up to the plate and furnish the money. The first country will cost about three million dollars. The next country will be a small fraction of that, but there will be numerous expenses including training people to use the MMS. Many people will want to come and be trained. We will need to accommodate them as it will be the best and cheapest way to get people trained to treat the rest of Africa."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project Chapter 18 Page 79 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . There may be other humanitarian organizations that will come along and help, but we cannot depend upon them. So far they have refused to even admit that we exist or that the MMS exists. I have written to Bill Gates foundation many times and always receive polite letters of refusal. That’s better than most. Usually I don’t even get a polite letter of refusal. To begin to cure malaria and AIDS in any country , one program would go as follows: To this point I have found large amounts of Africans who cannot contribute money t oward their own health. Furthermore, many of them do not trust the drugs that are supposed to cure them enough to spend the little money that they have on them. Thus, in the beginning our treatment must be free or it simply won’t happen. Once we have pi cked a country that will accept us we will need to buy a compound from which the operation can be conducted. Several clinics would be set up in the local area where anyone could come for a dose of MMS. Then a number of vehicles would be purchased. There would be one MMS trained member for each vehicle. Local individuals would be hired, two for each vehicle. In the beginning they would be trained by the MMS members. The vehicles would travel out to the villages delivering the MMS solution and training the village chief and other members how to dispense the MMS solution. Local people work in Africa for $30 to $40 a month. They would be trained quickly to deliver the MMS solution and to train the villagers. Then probably in each cou ntry a manufacturing plant would be set up in the MMS compound. This would save a great deal of cost as the main cost so far has been shipping of the solution. The actual cost is less than one cent per dose, but the shipping increases the cost considerab ly. As more people were trained more delivery cars would be purchased. Each car would have a route to follow. There would be trained people in each car to continue to make sure that the villagers know how to use the Solution. With the proper money, t he expansion of cars and trained people would go fast as it takes only about three weeks to train an individual in the dispensing of the MMS solution. The average country of Africa should take a little more than a full year to get the MM S solution delivered to the people and responsible individuals properly trained. It is hoped that after the first two months working with the locals, that extra individuals can be accepted from other countries for training. Thus, other countries can beg in programs to get the MMS solution to their people."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project Chapter 18 Page 80 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . A great deal of money is needed, but it will be billions less than Bill Gates has in mind to give to research organizations that Africa will never see . Of course many other organizations and countries will read this book and begin their own programs; at least I hope they will. The human race certainly needs them to. We can’t fail if you, the reader, take some interest. Come to Africa, or set up a discussion gro up as to how you can help, or make some MMS and see that the old people and sick people in your neighborhood are treated. That alone could make the difference. Or just see that plenty of people get this book. Send me a letter or email and let me know ho w you are doing. There is a point, I don’t know how many people need to know, but a point can be reached which I call the point of no return. If we reach that point, the window can no longer be slammed in our face. That is when enough public individuals have learned the data, have used it, and know it works. Believe me; a few individuals won’t do it. It will take millions who know that it works. Please join us. Either use it, or just accept the idea that the public deserves to know. Get as many peop le to download the free e - book The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Part I and then purchase part II if possible. And when you successfully use the MMS to help someone or yourself, broadcast it widely. We MAY only have a few months. You proba bly have less than 12 months to get it to the public. The elimination and prevention of suffering, misery and death of millions depends upon you. ( Sorry to be so dramatic, but that is the fact.)

One more thing, this is now the end of July, August 1, 2007. A fair number of organizations and people were expecti ng great changes to take place in July. They were expecting our government to change and for freedom to return. They were expecting help from above. Some were expecting help from God and others were expecting help from higher beings who were on their wa y here. I had a number of phone calls and several emails telling me not to worry. I could soon publish my book and everything would be alright. One group said a space ship was being set in orbit right now. I’m 75 years old. The message in the above pa ragraph has been given to me many times during the past 68 years. So let me give you, the reader, a message. I’ve had this message for more years than most of you would believe. It’s this: Mankind is going to have to save mankind. No wonderful help fr om above is ever coming. No wonderful beings of light or any other"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The Humanitarian Project Chapter 18 Page 81 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . great being is going to arrive and save us. If we get saved, we are going to have to do it. God is not going to save us. Remember the old saying, “God helps those who help themselves.” Well look at it. In the 20 th century more people were murdered and killed than all the centuries before. God didn’t save those hundreds of millions of people who were shot, or burned, or blown to bits. We are just going to have to save ourselves. Well, do as you wish, but promise me that every time you pray, you will go out and either give this book to someone, or better still, sell it to someone, because if they buy it, they will read it. In that case you really will be doing somethi ng to help ma nkind. One more thing I wanted to mention. Please learn to make the MMS and save some of the sodium chlorite powder somewhere, at least for your family. It won’t always be available. On the other hand, make lots of it and sell it when you can. Make some money, because there will be a big demand for it eventually, and if you have it you will be able to sell it. Few people realize at this time that when most of the people in the US can either make it or get their hands on it, most of the power of the FDA will be broken. The FDA bases most of their power on their ability to stop things that will decrease the income of the major pharmaceuticals. But with the MMS available to the people eventually most of the drugs will not be needed. Th at may take a while, but it could happen. See Chapter 23 if you have doubts "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Research Needed  Chapter 19 Page 82 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century . Chapter 19 Research Needed Of course research is need, billions of dollars worth of research. This is the most effective medicine that has ever been inv ented up to this time. We must know what is the maximum dose for every kind of disease that exists. We must know when to use it intravenously and when not to. We must know when it will cure cancer and when it will not. We must know if there are any bacterial diseases or virus diseases that it is not effective against and why. We only know, at this point, that it cures many things. The amount of knowledge is a tiny bit of what we should know. Anyone interested in research should contact me. Up to this point I have the most experience with the MMS , however, there is no doubt that many medical men will know more about it than me after I describe what I know to them. Medical men and alternate medicine people need to begin working with it, as many lives can be saved and much suffering can be alleviated. I am definitely willing to tell all I can to anyone doing research. The drug companies have a great deal of technology that could be used with the MMS. One important research woul d be to develop carriers that can carry the chlorine dioxide deeper into the body before it is released. Thus possibly getting to some of those incurable diseases that have not been touched so far (as far as we know). However, the chances of getting the drug companies to do such a thing are very slim. Their thinking has always been to make the patient feel more comfortable by eliminate some or most of the symptoms, because that will never cure the patient and thus you can continue to sell the drug for a long time. I suppose we couldn’t keep them from improving the formula if they decided to do so. But they don’t deserve to do so because they will sell the results as some sort of drugs for hundreds or thousands of dollars. We’ll see how that works out. I know that there are those who are doing a certain amount of research at this time. I hope they will keep it up and maybe help inform the public. If you have read Chapter 13 you do know that there is some research going on or maybe by the time this boo k is published that phase of the research will be completed. "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Basic Details for use of the MMS Chapter 20 Page 83 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century   Chapter 20 The Basic Details for use of the MMS The solution does not become the Miracle Mineral Supplement until you add 5 drops of one of the food acids for each drop of MMS from the bottle. The food acids consist of lemon juice, or lime juice, or 10% citric acid solution or in emergen cy vinegar , and until you have waited three minutes, and until after adding the fruit juice or water for drinking. Then drink immediately. (A longer than three minute wait, up to 10 minutes is OK .) After adding the fruit juice one can wait up to 1 hour before consuming. Lemon Juice and lime : Lemon juice or lime juice can be used. Generally use 5 drops to each one drops of MMS. Citric Acid : I believe at this time that citric acid is the most eff ective, but we need more data. Mix the citric acid 1 to 10 with water. That’s a 10% citric acid solution. One way to make it is to use a level tablespoon full of citric acid in a glass and then add 9 tablespoonfuls of water. When using this 10% citric acid solution, use 5 drops for each one drop of MMS. Vinegar: Any kind of vinegar is okay as long as it says at least 5% acetic acid . Use 5 drops for each drop of MMS, but Lime or lemon or citric acid is preferred. Juice: Use Apple juice, grape juice, pineapple juice, or cranberry juice. The juice must not have Vitamin C added, it prevents the activation. Read the label carefully, or make fresh juice. Orange juice : Do not use orange juice or other citrus juices . They prevent the activation. Please read Chapter 10 carefully. How much to use: (1) For maintenance use six drops MMS with one of the food acids mentioned above. Young people can use it twice a week, but older people (over 60) should use 6 drops every day. "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Basic Details for use of the MMS Chapter 20 Page 84 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century ( 2) For most diseases especially liver diseases, and including other problems: Start with two drops or less if one is very sick. Give the first dose, wait one hour and give a second dose. If you don’t notice an increase in nausea , go to three drops four hours later. The next day start with three drops in the morning and give a secon d dose in one or two hours. Then go to four drops in the after noon or evening before bed. Continue increasing the drops each morning doing a second dose in about one hour and a single dose in the afternoon or evening until you are taking 15 drops three t imes a day. See the protocols at the end of chapter 10 and follow them. Vomiting and diarrhea are a part of getting well in many cases. If you r body needs either one of them, it will do it. However it is always very short lived. You r body knows. Do not allow yourself to continue with Number of drops that might be required: Don’t go over 15 drops twice a day for at least 2 weeks, but if nothing seems to be getting better after two weeks increase the drops. When nothing is happeni ng and you are not well, increase the drops of MMS and always use the appropriate amount of acid drops and the 3 minute wait. (3) For malaria and other parasite diseases use 15 drops the very first dose. Wait one to two hours and give another 15 drops. Do the same the next day. Continue for 3 days. Check for parasites . If parasites are present, continue up to three months. All parasites will be dead long before three months. Remember; always us e the vinegar , wait, and juice. In most cases parasites including worms will be dead in three days. Malaria normally clears up in 4 hours or less. ( 4) Snake bite; take at least 15 drop doses every ½ hour for two hours, and then every hour for two hour s, and then every two hours. Continue every four hours until you are out of danger. As usual, use the vinegar , wait, and juice. Do not cut a snake bite in any case. Be sure to see a doctor, but do not allow him to cut the snake bite. It’s okay to use a suction device on the bite. Cutting spreads the poison too fast. (5) Burns, 1 st , 2 nd , or 3 rd degree burns : Do not use vinegar . Squirt the MMS directly on the burn full strength from the bottle. Make sure it cover s the burn. Wait no longer than 60 seconds and then wash the MMS off with water. It’s very good to use to stop pain and burning for sunburns, but WARNING, do not leave on more than 6 0 seconds. It must be washed off. Most any drinkable liquid is okay to use to wash off in extreme emergencies.

(6) Food poisoning: Take 12 drops for the first dose and 6 drops every ½ hour. Be sure to us e the vinegar , wait, and use about 1/4 glass of juice or water. (7) Children: For a baby use 2 drops. For older children use three drops per 25 pounds of body weight. Start out with less for a baby like two drops or even one, then work up to three drops in a few hours if needed. Same with children except with malaria and parasitic diseases. In that case use the full amount to start with which is 3 drops for each 25 pounds of body weight. If th e parasitic disease is not handled in several days use as much as twice the figures given here. (8) Animals, use with any sick animal: For smaller animals use three drops per 25 pounds of body weight. For horses and other larger animals, use one drop fo r each 25 pounds of body weight. Use an appropriate amount of vinegar , wait, and normally use water added instead of juice. Most animals will go ahead and drink, but you may have to force feed the animal. In that case a turkey baser w ith a large squeeze bulb bought at most grocery stores works fine. If there is a question use smaller doses at first. The Miracle Mineral Supplement Contents is bottled at 28% sodium chlorite powder and distilled water. It is a clear slightly yellow s olution. Small amounts appear totally clear with no yellow showing. Sodium Chlorite Powder is only 80% sodium chlorite. The balance is mostly table salt with less than 1% other nontoxic sodium chemicals. The amount of sodium in a ny dose is not enough to consider harmful to any diet. Because sodium chlorite powder is always only 80% pure sodium chlorite the actual amount of pure sodium chlorite in the MMS solution is 22.4%. Sodium chlorite in a six drop dose: There are 54 mg of sodium chlorite in a six drop dose of MMS and about 10 mg of salt. Not enough to count during any one day. Sodium dioxide is also generated. There is one to two milligrams generated initially by the vinegar , and then one to two mg pe r hour is generated as the chlorine dioxide degenerates into table salt and water. Chlorine dioxide : 12 drops of MMS with the added vinegar generates from 1 to 2 mg of chlorine dioxide. When it is diluted with ½ glass of juice there is less than 1 ppm in the solution. (There are still 1 to 2 milligrams that goes into the body, but 1 ppm is less than what is acceptable in some foods by FDA guidelines). The MMS solution the n continues to generate 1 to 2 milligrams"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Basic Details for use of the MMS Chapter 20 Page 86 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century per hour of chlorine dioxide for up to 12 hours in the human body. Chlorine Dioxide : The American Chemical Society, Analytical Chemistry Division stated in 1999 that chlorine dioxide is the most powerful killer of pathogens known to man. Chlorine dioxide is used in many industrial processes. It has been used to sterilize food products such as red meat and poultry for over 50 years. It is used in hospitals and clinic s as a sterilizing agent. Buying Sodium Chlorite: See 2 nd part of chapter 16. Formula for Sodium Chlorite: NaClO 2 . Na=Sodium Cl=chlorine and O 2 =Oxygen (The O 2 in all cases here merely indicates that two atoms of oxygen exist. It i s not an indication of the charge.) The actual charge on the oxygen is - 2 (minus two) which leave the oxygen in the neutral condition. It’s the same charge as the oxygen in carbon dioxide. It can’t be used for oxidation. Formula for Chlorine Dioxide: Cl O 2. You can observe that just the Na (sodium) has been removed to make the chlorine dioxide. The O 2 is two oxygen ions with a charge of two electrons each. That is considered minus two ( - 2) because electrons have a negative charge. Oxyg en ions at this charge cannot oxidize anything and thus are not available to the body for oxidization. The Cl stands for chlorine which is a chlorine ion in this case with a positive charge until it oxidizes and destroys something in which case it winds up with a negative charge as well. It then is a chloride which is the same as chloride in table salt . It cannot do further reactions. Formula for Oxygen: O 2 that means that an oxygen molecule consists of two oxyge n atoms that are bound together. The oxygen enters the body for the purpose of oxidation in the elemental state. When it oxidizes various items in the body it releases energy creating the warmth of the body. During the oxidization process the oxygen ato ms are charged to - 2 (minus two) electrons. They are then oxygen ions . They have reached their neutral state. In the neutral state (minus 2 electron charge) they cannot be used by the body. In this state they form carbon dioxide and are expelled from the body as one breathes out. They are then recharged by green trees and other green plants. The oxygen ions that are attached to chlorine dioxide, like carbon dioxide, have a minus two electron charge and thus are neutral. The body cannot use them. They either form carbon dioxide or they become part of the water of the body. Oxidation : In the old days of chemistry, it was thought that oxygen was the only thing that oxidized metal, other chemicals and things. But as a better understanding of chemistry came about it was soon learned that any element"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The Basic Details for use of the MMS Chapter 20 Page 87 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century or ion or molecule that brought about an exchange of electrons was basically the same oxidization process that oxygen created. Oxygen accepts electrons fro m other elements or molecules and at the same time causing the release of some energy in the form of heat. That’s oxidization. Well so do many other elements, molecules and ions accept electrons or create an exchange of electrons and rele ase energy. Oxygen can accept 2 electrons at which time it becomes neutral and can accept no more electrons . However, a chlorine dioxide molecule can accept 5 electrons. Thus it also oxidizes, but with much more whamo. Oxygen when neutralized by a min us two charge normally leaves the body as carbon dioxide. That means that carbon dioxide has two ions of oxygen, but neutralized oxygen. The two oxygen ions are then charged back to their elemental state by green plants and the sun , again making them available to create oxidization in the body. Chlorine, itself, is also an oxidizer, but it oxidizes by chlorination, that is, it not only exchanges electrons, but it combines with whatever it is oxidizing making many new compounds. Some of these compounds are cancer causing.

I almost didn’t write this chapter because this book is about MMS, but this information is something that everyone who is interested in health should know. It also gives a little more data about the FDA . Let me first make a few statements that are undisputable facts, provable in court of law and by a hundred different sources including the Internet. The data I am going to tell y ou is absolutely undisputable, yet most people ignore it. The first thing you should know is that most of the FDA experts are also on the payroll of the pharmaceutical companies. You would think that would be agai nst public policy. But no, it seems that they have the right to moonlight just like anyone else, even if it is counterproductive. Should you want the facts on this, read the book Deadly Medicine by Thomas Moore. Secondly, in 1992 the FDA started a public campaign to deny the America people the right to purchase vitamins without going to a doctor and obtaining a prescription. They spent millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money pushing this cause, but it didn’t work. Worse than that, it b ackfired against them. Not just thousands but millions of American people arose up against this attack on our liberty and wrote their congressmen. In August of 1994 congresses fixed their wagon on this score attempting to do it permanently, but that evide ntly wasn’t possible. A law was passed unanimously by both houses and signed into law by the president. Did you see that? Unanimously. That’s what the America people can do if they really try. (All of this is now a matter of public records). The law was called DSHEA (The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994). This law attempts to guarantee the American people free access to vitamins and other essential nutrients and to the educational data concerning these nutrients. The reason why th e educational data was included is that the pharmaceutical companies had been campaigning to prevent any and all claims of health benefits concerning vitamins from being published. Do you see? They would have even prevented book s from being printed"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 89 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century telling us about vitamins . They spent not just millions but billions on this idea. Now we have a law to protect us. The Constitution should have been enough, but we need all the help we can get. But that still wasn’t enough. T he pharmaceutical companies banded together to form a cartel at the international level. They started a worldwide campaign to ban all data concerning the health benefits of vitamins and minerals and other natural substances from being distributed anywhere in the world. They approached the world through the United Nations Food Standards Commission. They thought that they could force the industrial nations and the world to accept vitamins as prescription medicine. Disguised as a consumer protection initiative, this concept was to be recommended to the UN General Assembly. There were to be trade sanctions on any countries that refused to accept vitamins as prescription medicine. That was the year of 1997. The main actor in this pharmaceutical vitamin cartel was the German government. Germany exports more pharmaceutical products than any other nation. They might have succeeded except for one doctor, Matthias Rath, M. D. On June 22, 1997, he gave a spe ech to an audience in Chemnitz, Germany. He exposed the cartel and their intentions in that speech and connected them to the pharmaceutical companies who were profiteers of World War II and even the Holocaust. As a result of this speech and several other speeches and hundreds of thousands of protest letters, the idea was so controversial by the time it was to be presented to the UN General Assembly that they did not succeed. Even bigger than that, May 20, 1999 these multinational pharmaceutical companies admitted to forming a “Vitamin - Cartel” to fix the prices of raw vitamins and materials. They defrauded hundreds of millions of people worldwide of more than 100 billion dollars. They were fined about one billion dollars. The U .S. Justice Department declared that they were the largest illegal cartel ever uncovered. This tiny fine in reference to the total amount they bilked from the people of the world was inconsequential. Are you starting to see? The pharmaceutical companies have no conscience. They will do anything to prevent a loss of money or to make money. They care not how many deaths that they cause. The pharmaceutical companies through the FDA have suppressed dozens of disc overies concerning cures for cancer , heart disease and many other diseases for more than 50 years. I know that you probably think that is crazy, but so would you think that about the above information if it were not so m uch a part of the record. There is nothing that I have said above that can be disputed. It’s all a matter of record. It all happened just as stated above and can be investigated by any high school"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 90 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century student and proven to be facts. The proof of the suppre ssion of the discoveries of cures for cancer and other diseases are slightly more covered up at this time, but still quite provable. The FDA has depended upon the incredibility of what they have done and the indifference of the public to maintain their fa rce. One other story of facts. The amino acid Tryptophan was sold in health food stores throughout the US as an a id for sleep. It really worked and thousands of people bought it as opposed to several drug sleep aids. Try ptophan replaced several millions of dollars that the drug companies were no longer able to sell. Then guess what, Tryptophan evidently caused the death of one person in the US and several in Japan. The FDA immediately took it off the shel f of every health food store in the US. This amino acid is manufactured in Japan and it was found that somehow an impurity had gotten into the amino acid jar. Although the problem was fixed and acceptable purity rules were put in place in the Japanese ma nufacturing plant, it was never allow back in the US. It was later found that American FDA agents had visited the Japanese Tryptophan plant before the impure jars of Tryptophan were shipped. So now drug companies that sell sleep drugs make millions of dollars selling the drugs that replace the Tryptophan. Do you see? One person dead from amino acid impurities and America can no longer have Tryptophan, but hundreds of thousands of people are dead from drugs and that is completely acceptabl e. Am I the only one that sees something wrong with that? It can now be shown to any researcher that every person in America is in some way personally touched by suffering and death as a result of the FDA ’s betrayal of the American people. But worse than that every person in the world is to some extent affected by the suppression of data for the cure of many different diseases. The indifference results mostly from realizing that one can really do nothing to change the status quo. But now that can be changed simply by everyone informing his relatives, friends and neighbors of this book. You may think that law I mention earlier in this chapter the DSHEA of 1994 has protected us. Well, not so. As soon as it was out of the public eye the F DA has been at it again to get congress to pass a law saying that all supplements must be approved by the FDA before sales in the US. Now the FDA has publicly stated that they intend to shut down 50% of the supplement business in the US usi ng this new law. Now with 970,000 drugs related deaths each year and not even one single supplement related death per year in the entire health food field the FDA is going to limit our right to have supplements unless they approve of them. They are not f ooling around. They"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 91 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century have stated their intention to enforce this new law with vengeance. Congress has betrayed the America public once again. The DSHEA law will be useless with this new law. They were informed of the damage this law would cause. There i s only one reason why they will agree to this law in both the house and senate. They are bought and paid for. These laws are in the works in both the house and the senate and are scheduled to be law in 2010. So far all congressmen and senators have been in favor. About the FDA suppression of cures: I am going describe two of the more important suppression incidents below and then tell you where you can check my data for accuracy. Be advised, however, I am only hitting the top of the iceb erg. There are many more cases that I do not have time and space to cover. You can also see why I moved out of the country to publish this book. Now you are going to say, “But the constitution of the U.S. allows you to publish anything.” Well, the FDA doesn’t care about that. They arrest such authors and scientist inventors and charge them with almost anything. But they don’t care. They can keep an author in jail for a long time on trumped up charges. The judges in that area of the law are FDA judge s. They keep saying that if the author will withdraw his book or say his cure doesn’t work they will withdraw the charges. By the time the author has spent all his money on lawyers he often gives in. Dozens of cures have been lost because the inventor or author just was too tired of fighting to go on, and he died of a heart attack, or he did spend years in jail. Actually, it’s a lot worse than just that. They seize property and destroy businesses. They often take everything that is in a business including the car and bank account. Many times they do it without a search warrant. They destroy a person’s life. During the trial they have their own judges who will not allow any reasonable defense. A hero who has spent his life helping peo ple and searching for a cure to one disease or another can find himself in prison for years. These incidents are a crime of the worst kind against humanity. They destroy the business and a person’s whole life to suppress a cure. They do it in the name o f public safety and no one can stop them. You ask why they do it. They do it for the billions of dollars that the pharmaceutical companies will make if the cure is not given to the public throughout the world. It often scares clerks about their jobs. If a cure is found for cancer , thousands of jobs will be lost. Radiation therapy jobs will be lost and chemotherapy drugs will no longer be manufactured. Hospitals will go out of busine ss. But millions of lives will be saved and untold suffering will be stopped. Would you rather save the jobs, or stop the suffering and then have those people retrained for other jobs?

If everyone will send this book to at least two people, or at lease see that at least two people download the free e - book P art 1 from www.miraclemineral.org, the America people will have a cure that will eliminate more than 50% and as much as 80% of the drugs consumed by mankind at this time. In the long - run millions of lives will be saved and the suffering that will be stopp ed is incalculable. If you have read this book you know that this is true, and if you don’t know that it is true then give MMS a try. It cures cancer when used properly or used with other know cancer cures such as the Indian Herb mixtur e. And as I have said all profits from the book will be used by me to distribute this book in the world or in Africa to bring this cure to the African people. I have got to be careful with what I say, or they will prosecute me on someth ing like this.

For more than a hundred years there have been two basic theories of cancer. The other theory has been suppressed. Live s have been destroyed, people have been jailed and sent to prison, and books have been burned. Every conceivable disgus t ing thing that can be done has been done to prevent the second theory of cancer from ever coming to scientific light or becoming known to the public. Funny things, all of the demonstrated cures of cancer have been based on the second theory, or similar concepts. More than two dozen or more of those cures have each had more than one thousand documented cases of complete cures from cancer , some of them more than 10,000 documented cures and several more than 100,000 cases recorded. So let me tell you in a few nontechnical sentences the difference between the two different theories of cancer . The present theory of cancer is that healthy body cells for some unknown reason mutate into cancerous cells. The general idea is that the unknown reason is aging, poor diet, heredity, a bad condition that slowly mutates into cancer, or something along those lines. Using this theory, billions of dollars have been spent on research and millions of men, women and children have suffered and died for more than 100 years while no significant improvement in cancer treatment has happened. That’s 100 years without an answ er or even a real improvement. Of course there are a lot of scientists that would like to argue against that. There was what they call a great improvement in the chemotherapy chemicals in about 1948 but there is still more people dying of cancer than ever. There is no indication that"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 93 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century chemotherapy increases one’s chances of living. Does that seem like a poor picture to you? The same treatment for over a 100 years and no real change in the treatment for more than 100 years and th ey still use it and research it, and still a higher percentage are dying of cancer than ever before. The second theory which is the unaccepted theory of cancer is that cancer is caused by a very unusual virus that chang es its size and shape from a virus to a bacterium and back to a virus again. There are a lot of technical terms I am missing, but that’s the basic concept. This second theory is called pleomorphism. Research into this theory is not allowed. You may say , “I thought America was a free country.” Well, that’s so, but not to those who want to do research into this particular theory of cancer. No money is available for such research, and those who try hit a blank wall. Nobody cooperates with them. Their c olleagues won’t talk to them anymore. The FDA , FTC and the AMA put every possible stop in their way that they can find. Let me say again, all the suppressed cures that have worked have been based on this very unusual virus theory or simila r concepts. Please, please, please, don’t believe me. Go to the Internet and dig deep enough to find the facts. The facts are there, and when you have facts you can prove them. There is always proof somewhere there, often hidden but re coverable. We ne ed millions of more people who know the facts. They don’t have to be technical; they just need to know what is really going on. So let me tell you one book to read to get you started. It’s The Cancer Cure that Worked by Barry Lynes and John Crane. They give references and tell where you can go to get the actual records. In this book we are talking about MMS. So far many people have stated that after taking the MMS that their cancer went away. MMS kills viruses a nd bacteria . It has been established for 100 years that chlorine dioxide kills viruses and bacteria. We have not proven that MMS will attack mutated cancerous cells. But what has happened is that skin cancer including melanoma dries up and flakes off like the scab of a sore . It doesn’t look like the cancer was attacked; it looks more like the cancer just quit growing and the body simply healed the area. That’s what would have happened if the virus were killed. Well, we don’t know do we? Yet. Here is one more thing that the FDA really doesn’t want you to know. Heart attacks have nothing to do with cholesterol levels in your blood. The AMA and other medical research oriented groups have not produced a single study that proves that people with high levels of cholesterol have more heart attacks"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 94 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century than those with low levels. They have proved, however, that they can sell billions of dollars of cholesterol lowering drugs. Dr. Matthias Rath has shown that the basis of heart attacks is vitamin deficiency, mainly vitamin C . Get his books. Believe me. He has proven it. Vitamins prevent heart attacks, not cholesterol lowering drugs. Dr. Matthias Rath points out that th ere are several thousand miles of blood veins in your body. Those don’t clog up and cause problems. If cholesterol in the blood was causing problems, it would cause problems throughout the body. Only the ten inches of veins right at the heart are affected by cholesterol. Now why would that be? It’s because those veins at the heart are smashed flat at every heart pump, like 70 or 80 times a minute, millions of times a year. They fail not because they are clogged, but because the walls of the veins cannot take being flattened so many times, and they crack. Vitamin C is what causes the walls of blood vessels to be strong. Scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency, and heart attack is part of the same problem. The deposit on the walls of those particular veins is only to increase the strength and prevent the veins from being totally flattened and not for the purpose of clogging the veins . When the vein cracks it stays flat instead of opening again and that is what is causing heart attacks. Vitamin C is what prevents heart attacks. Read Dr. Rath’s books, and be sure to buy some vitamin C. The pharmaceutical companies definitely don’t want you to read his books, because you won’t buy their cholesterol drugs. Cholesterol is the body’s response to a deficiency of vitamin C . The body seeks to strengthen the walls of the blood vessels and prevent them from cracking by depositing the cholesterol. I should mention that Dr. Rath wo rked with Dr. Linus Pauling for many years. Dr. Linus Pauling agreed with Dr. Rath’s findings and they worked together to further verify and understand the use of vitamins in the body. Dr. Linus Pauling was the only man in history to receive two unshared Nobel prizes in the medical field. His agreement and help with these findings adds a great deal of credence to them. Modern medicine insists on treating the symptoms and refuses to find the cause, because if they find the cause they will cure the proble m. If they cure the problem, they will not be able to continue selling drugs. It’s sorry, but the fact is that it is all based on money. Let’s first talk about Dr. William Frederic Koch. Dr. Koch developed a medicine from herbs which he called glyoxylide. He cured his first cancer patient in 1917 and thousands thereafter when you count what he did and"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 95 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century what the other doctors did using his medicine. What do you think the conventional treatment for cancer was at that time? The treatment that had at that time already been in use for many years began more than 100 years ago. I’ll bet you couldn’t guess what it was in a hundred years. Well amazing as it may seem, it was x - ray and radium radiation, the same as it i s now. One hundred years and they are still using the same treatment and guess what, more and more people are dying from cancer. Does anyone see anything wrong with the picture here? Don’t you think at some point or the other those responsible would say , “Maybe we ought to do a little research into an alternate idea?” No, they just go blithely on researching the same basic theory. It is the result of the pharmaceutical companies only making money available for certain kinds of research that they know will get nowhere. Dr. Koch said that you don’t want to kill the cancer cells; you want to remove the virus that is causing the cell to be sick and thus allow the cancer cell to return to norma l. The FDA and FTC attacked Dr. Koch for years. He was driven from the U.S. and traveled to Brazil where he had phenomenal success treating advanced rheumatoid arthritis , insanity, diabetes, case s of advanced cancer , and even leprosy. The FDA was extremely alarmed and demanded that he return to the U.S. Later when he did return he was arrested on trumped - up charges. Two trials were held and both times the jury acquitted Dr. Ko ch despite the fact that the judge would not allow a single cured patient to testify. The trials went on from 1942 to 1946 and cost the government more than $10,000,000 which is the equivalent to $100,000,000 in present day money. They could not prove th at Dr. Koch’s technology did not cure cancer, but by this time none of his herbs for his cure were available in the U.S. Colonel Charles March took over as head of the FTC and attempted to stop the attacks against Dr. Koch , but he met with a sudden and questionable death. Deaths of that nature in those times seem to happen to a number of people involved with alternate medical treatment. That is not to say that such deaths do not happen now, because they do. A very good friend of mine , who discovered several cures for several important diseases went home about 5 years ago and a bomb in his apartment, blew both of his legs off. He lived, but the idea that they don’t stop people now days is a lie. Although the FTC could not legally sto p Dr. Koch from selling his medicine to doctors, they gave him a cease and desist order from advertising in any way to doctors. This prevented doctors from knowing about it and from using it to treat cancer patients a nd other diseases. It is estimated that in excess of 100,000 patients were cured of cancer between the years of 1917 when Dr."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 96 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century Koch cured his first cancer patient until 1951 when the FTC ordered him to stop advertising to doctors. His laboratories were un able to stay in business without the sales. Recently there are those who have attempted to duplicate his formula, but he and most of those who knew the details are now dead. Basically this cure for cancer and many other diseases has been lost. Do you se e why the MMS is so important at this time? It is a medicine that can be used by anyone and everyone can know the formula. Once out, and once it has been tested widely by the public, none of the alphabet soup agencies (FDA , FTC, AMA mostly ) will have any way to stop it, and the pharmaceutical companies will be up a creek. It will be the dawning of the end of the tremendous cash flow for drugs that treat only the symptoms. If my strategy works and it does get to t he public, it will be the beginning of many books of the same nature by others. The end of the tremendous suffering of mankind at the hands of medical and pharmaceutical people for money is in sight. With the Internet and modern technology, normal people can now know more than doctors used to know. We can no longer be kept in ignorance about medicine. The dawn of the age of information has already happened, but this is the dawn of the age of medical information to the average person. I hope it is. It is if you help. Had Dr. Koch ’s cure been used by all doctors, literally millions of people would not have suffered and died. They would have lived happy lives. The other cancer - cure that I wanted to mention is the o ne developed by Royal R. Rife of San Diego, California. He started research somewhat later than Dr. Koch , but in the same era. His research started in 1920. He began by inventing a microscope that was quite different from the best st andard microscopes. His best microscope had a magnification of 30,000, although his first ones were not that powerful. The problem was that in the scientific field it is well known that the most powerful non electronic microscope had only 2,500 powers. The theory of light prevents anything more powerful than that because at that power the light waves theoretically cannot be amplified any more. Rife, however, had his own theory of light microscopes. The electronic microscope cannot be used with small vi ruses because the light frequency that it uses destroys the virus. Rife built many really tremendous microscopes over his lifetime; each new one was better than the one before. His microscopes were duplicated and some still exist to th is day. They were so powerful that they could reveal the viruses that caused cancer . The microscopes used several different light sources of different frequencies. His microscope used the heterodyne principle of light frequency. That’ s where one frequency is converted to another frequency. This principle has been used in radio"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 97 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century frequencies for many years and still is. Rife just learned to use it with light frequencies. No reason why he shouldn’t, but his microscopes were destroyed an d his books and plans were burned. Despite that fact literally hundreds of doctors used Rife’s microscopes to identify and verify cancer. The other thing that Rife did, after identifying the cancer virus, was design a device that kille d the cancer virus in place? The theory that he used was simple and scientific. He used the theory of radio antennas. It is not a hard basic theory to understand. Each different frequency will cause a flow of electrical current in an exact precise leng th of metal. So if you have a wire of the right length connected to your radio, you can pick up the frequency that causes an electrical flow of current in that wire. You don’t see the wire anymore in modern radios, but it’s there somewhere. So Rife figu red, “We know that those little fellows can conduct electricity, so why not make a radio antenna out of them.” He decided that all he needed to do was measure their size and then calculate the frequency that would cause an electrical current to flow in th em the same as a TV or radio antenna. If he could cause an electrical current to flow in them that would kill them. A special Research Committee of the University of Southern California oversaw his laboratory work until the end of the 1930's. Follow - up clinics conducted in 1935, 1936 and 1937 by the head of the U.S.C. Medical Committee verified the results that he was getting. Independent physicians, utilizing machines that were duplicates of Rife’s machine, successfully treated as many as 40 patients p er day. A number of doctors continued to treat patients for up to 22 years, but the pressure became too great. When authorities found a machine in operation they either destroyed it on the spot or confiscate it for evidence. Rife determined the precise frequency for herpes, tuberculosis, and other illnesses as well as cancer . His work was in Science magazines, medical journals, and later the Smithsonian Institution’s annual report. Thousands were cured during the 1930's, and then the authorities struck. Rife began working with John Crane, and engineer. Rife’s life work was in John Crane’s lab when the authorities hit it. They destroyed everything, burned books and jailed John Crane. After that there were continuous problems with th e authorities. The University no longer backed Rife and he simply had to quit. Today there are numerous people throughout the world that have Rife frequency generators. Many do not work as they do not duplicate Rife’s work closely enough, but many do w ork and cancer and other diseases are still cured with these frequency generators. There are even a few people who have his microscopes or good duplicates of his microscopes. They still work. "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 98 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century T he question is how were these people stopp ed when they were curing people? How was the truth covered over so easily? There are two reasons. Both were greed. There were scientists who did not want their theories of cancer and other diseases questioned and there were the pharma ceutical companies who did not want their incomes decreased. Billions of dollars can exert huge amounts of pressure. The medical laws of this country have been shaped by the pharmaceutical companies. They have spent billions of dollars with at least two lawyers in Washington, D.C. for each representative and each senator. It all boils down to money, but the criminality of it is beyond belief. Millions suffer and die so that they can make money, and there was another reason. M any of the medical scientists were pushing their own favorite concepts that made then well known and they were mostly in with the pharmaceutical companies. That also boils down to money. Hundreds of very important industries exist in the United States th at do not spend billions of dollars influence Congress on making laws. There is no acceptable reason for the drug companies to be spending that huge amount of money to influence congress, but they do. You can check my accuracy in these statements by goin g on the Internet and reading some of the thousands of documents that are available. Just go to Google or one of the other search engines and put in the various names of the people I have mentioned or just put in FDA Suppression. The Inter net documents then point you towards the actual documents. The proof is all there. The FDA likes to dispute it, of course, and there is no money to dispute them. They have the billions to say you are wrong. In court, you don’t have a chance to prove te chnology. They always bring up points of law and one never gets to the crux of the matter which is that the present technology is wrong. There is simply no proving anything. But the fact is, anyone who wants to dig can prove the points I give here, but smart lawyers won’t allow it to be brought up in court. This book about the MMS might be able to change some of the suffering and overcome some of the power of the pharmaceutical giants. If it is distributed widely enough, that will happen.

Ta ke the time to verify it. It’s important to you and your family. One other thing you should know. There are no incurable diseases. Along with the MMS there are cures for every disease known. They are suppressed. Many were discovered years ago and now set unused. The stories and lies about the “Quacks” have prevented alternate medicine from using many of them and books have been burned. Why was it necessary to burn books and destroy microscopes and other valuable equipment if there was nothing that w ould work? By their actions they have proved something of value was there. With the public’s help we can make this a better world where there are no incurable diseases. The answers are there, all we need to do is to prevent our government from suppressi ng the answers. The public has the power and we can do it. The MMS is not the only cure for many diseases, but it will give you a lot more confidence to see the MMS work. Your first step is to use some of it and see that it works. The second step is to start telling your neighbors and everyone you know. That’s all we need. The world will change. Help us defeat the FDA . You may not believe it, but the FDA has been suppressing all real cancer cures, and information conc erning how vitamins prevent heart attacks and all other information or products that may in any way reduce the income of the large pharmaceutical medical drug companies. Please don’t take my word for it; become i nformed. Read the data available on the Internet. Just go to any search engine and put in “FDA Suppression.” There is tremendous documentation starting back in the 1930’s. They often put authors in jail and tell them that they will withdr aw the accusations if the author will withdraw his claims. Once the author has lost all of his money and is tired of fighting he gives up. There are hundreds of medical facts that are suppressed right now that would save thousands of lives. There are ma ny records of people who have died under very questionable conditions when they have tried to inform the people. Please don’t write this off as a bunch of crazy conspiracy nuts. Your life and the life of thousands are at stake. Isn’t that important enou gh to at least try it once on someone, or on you? Spend a couple of hours. Why do you suppose drugs in this world, especially in America, almost always treat symptoms? That’s no secret about drugs only treating symptoms, most"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Heart Attacks, what Causes Them and the FDA Chapter 21 Page 100 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century people know that already. A sk any person interested in health. Medical drugs treat symptoms and all of the medical research by pharmaceutical companies is directed towards treating symptoms, and not towards finding the cause of the problem. Well, the reaso n is that if you find the cause of a disease or health problem you can usually cure the problem. In that case you cannot continue to sell the drug over an d over until the person dies. Billions of dollars are involved. Treating symptoms does not cure or c hange the problem. Why do you reason that there has been no significant advancement in Cancer technology in 100 years? With one or two minor exceptions the same treatments are still used, more than 100 years later. The world has advance fantastically in almost everything but cancer treatment and other disease treatments. They refine the treatment, make the drugs more pure, make the needles better, make the X - ray machines better, make the records better, and make the timers better that t ime the treatment, but the treatment itself does not change. There is only one way that they could keep the same treatment for 100 years and that is to suppress every new concept that ever arose. They have their own judges, their own laws, and they simpl y stop any real improvements. The pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars with at least two lawyers for each Congressman and each senator and many law offices in Washington, DC. They have tried again and again to supp ress vitamins. I don’t have time to cover all of the data here. Please become informed on this subject. The data and the proof are available. The truth cannot be suppressed. Just read the thousands of documents available on the Internet. They spent b illions influencing Congress on the pretension of public safety to prevent us from even having printed literature on vitamins. Do you imagine that we would be much safer if we didn’t know about vitamins? (I mentioned this before earlier in book 1, but i t is important enough to mention again, and possibly you didn’t read book 1.) Now, the MMS is such a simple cure that it need not be relegated to doctors. The public at large has the ability to treat themselves. This means that the FDA is going to have a much harder time at suppressing this one. The public, the sick and suffering have this one short window that will be open, we don’t know for how long. But this time the FDA cannot suppress a couple of doctors or arrest the author of a bo ok. (They can’t find me.) Luckily I am not tied to some expensive lab, and I can move around. But they don’t have to find me to stop it. The billions of dollars behind them will definitely try, because ultimately a great part of those billions are lost if the MMS becomes well known.

By Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD Copyright © August 7th, 2007 DISCOVERY Jim Humble, a modern gold prospecting geologist, needed to travel to malaria infested areas numerous times. He o r his coworkers would on occasion contract malaria. At times access to modern medical treatment was absolutely unavailable. Under such dire circumstances it was found that a solution useful to sanitize drinking water was also effective to treat malaria if diluted and taken orally. Despite no formal medical training Mr. Humble had the innate wisdom to experiment with various dosage and administration techniques. Out of such necessity was invented an easy to use treatment for malaria which was found rapidly e ffective in almost all cases. [1] References: 1. A Possible Solution to the Malaria Problem? Humble J Libertarian Times, May 9, 2005 MATERIALS AND METHODS The procedure as used by Mr. Humble follows: A 28% stock solution of 80% (technical grade) sodi um chlorite (NaClO2 ) is prepared. The remaining 20% is a mixture of the usual recipients necessary in the manufacture and stabilization of sodium chlorite powder or flake. Such are mostly sodium chloride (NaCl ) ~19%, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) <1%, and sodium chlorate (NaClO3) <1%. The actual sodium chlorite present is therefore 22.4%. Using a large caliber dropper (25 drops per cc), the usual administered dose per treatment is 6 to 15 drops. In terms of mi lligrams of sodium chlorite, this calculates out to 9mg per drop or 54mg to 135mg per treatment. Effectiveness is enhanced, if prior to administration the selected drops are premixed with 2.5 to 5 cc of table vinegar or lime juice and allowed to react for 3 minutes. The acidified solution is then mixed into a glass of water or apple juice and taken orally. This can be taken on an empty stomach to enhance effectiveness"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD Chapter 22 Page 104 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century but this often causes nausea . Nausea is less likely to occur if food is present such as one hour after meals. The vinegar (5% acetic acid ) or lime juice (6 to 9% citric acid ) neutralizes the sodium hydroxide and at the same time converts a small portion of the chlorite (ClO2 - ) to its conjugate acid known as chlorous acid (HClO2). Under such conditions some of the chlorous acid will oxidize other chlorite anions and gradually produce chlorine dioxide (ClO2). C hlorine dioxide appears in solution as a yellow tint which smells exactly like chlorine. BENEFITS: I first learned of Jim Humble's remarkable discovery in the fall of 2006. That sodium chlorite or chlorine dioxide could kill parasites in vivo seemed immediately reasonable to me at the onset. It is well known that many disease causing organisms are sensitive to oxidants. Various compounds classifiable as oxides of chlorine such as sodium hypochlorite and ch lorine dioxide are already widely used as disinfectants. What is novel and exciting here is that Mr. Humble's technique seems: 1) easy to use, 2) rapidly acting, 3) successful, 4) apparently lacking in toxicity, and 5) affordable. If this treatment continu es to prove effective, it could be used to help rid the world of one of the most devastating of all known plagues. [1, 2] Especially moving in me is the empathy I feel for anyone with a debilitating febrile illness. I cannot forget how horrible I feel when ever I have caught influenza. How much more miserable it must be to suffer like that again and again every 2 to 3 days as happens in malaria . Millions of people suffer this way year round. 1 to 3 million dies from malaria every year most ly children . Thus motivated I sought to learn all I could about the chemistry of the oxides of chlorine. I wanted to understand their probable mechanisms of toxicity towards the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium species). [3] I wa nted to check available literature pertaining to issues of safety or risk in human use. References: 1. Current status of malaria control.

I had taught at numerous seminars on their use and explained their mechanisms of action on the biochemical level. Oxidants are atoms or molecules which take up electrons. Reductants are atoms or molecules which donate electrons to oxidants. Low dose oxidant exposure to living red blood cells induces a change in oxyhemoglobin (Hb - O2) activity so that more oxygen (O2) is released to tissues throughout the body.

Taken internally, intermittently and in low doses many oxidants have been found to be powerful immune stimulants. Exposure of live blood to ultraviolet light has similar immune enhancing effects. These treatments work th rough a natural physiologic trigger mechanism, which induces peripheral white blood cells to express and to release cytokines. These cytokines serve as an alarm system to increase cellular attack against pathogens and to down - regulate allergic reactions. Activated cells of the immune system naturally produce strong oxidants as part of the inflammatory process at sites of infection or cancer to rid the body of these diseases. One such natural defe nse oxidant is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Another is peroxynitrate ( - OONO) the coupled product of superoxide (*OO - ) and nitric oxide (*NO) radicals. Yet another is hypochlorous acid (HOCl) the conjugate acid of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO).

[4, 11, 12, 13, 28] All bacteria have been shown to be incapable of growing in any medium in which the oxidants (electron grabbers) out - number the reductants (electron donors). [29] Thus oxidants are at least bacteriostatic and at most are bactericidal.

Chlorine di oxide has been similarly used. [15] Hypochlorites (ClO - ) are commonly used as bleaching agents, as swimming pool sanitizers, and as disinfectants. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as well as ozone (O3) are e ffective disinfectants for public water supplies and are often used for that purpose. [9,14] Sodium chlorite (NaClO2 ) solutions have long been used as mouth washes to rapidly clear mouth odors and oral bacteria . Acidif ied sodium chlorite is FDA approved as a spray in the meat packing industry to sanitized meat. [1, 2, 8, 10, 26] Farmers use this to cleanse the udders of cows to prevent mastitis, [5, 6, 7] and to rid eggs of pathogenic bacteria. Chlorine d ioxide kills many viruses . [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] Acidified sodium chlorite is even useful to sanitize vegetables. [3] Some work has been done using dilute solutions of sodium chlorite internally to treat fungal infecti ons, chronic fatigue, and cancer . Little however has been published in that regard.

OXIDATION - REDUCTION POTENTIALS IN BACTERIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY L F Hewitt, 6th Ed, E. & S. Livingston Ltd., 1950 MALARIA IS OXIDANT SENSITIVE >From November 20 06 through May of 2007 I spent hundreds of hours searching biochemical literature and medical literature pertaining to the biochemistry of Plasmodia. Four species are commonly pathogenic in humans namely: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae. What I found was an abundance of confirmation that, just like bacteria , Plasmodia are indeed quite sensitive to oxidants. [15] Examples of oxidants toxic to Plasmodia include: artemisinin [16, 27, 36, 41] , atovaquone [48], menadione, and methylene blue [29,47]. Also like bacteria and tumor cells, the ability of Plasmodia to live and grow depends heavily on an internal abundance of thiol compounds [38, 55]. Thiols are also known as sulfhydryl compounds (RSH ). Thiols as a class behave as reductants (electron donors). Thus they are notoriously sensitive to oxidation and they are rapidly reactive with oxides of chlorine. This includes sodium chlorite (NaClO2 ) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) the ve ry agents present in Mr. Humble's solution. The"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD Chapter 22 Page 109 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century products of oxidation of thiols using various oxides of chlorine are: disulfides (RSSR), disulfide monoxides (RSSOR), sulfenic acids (RSOH), sulfinic acids (RSO2H), and sulfonic acids (RSO3H). None of these c an support the life processes of the parasite. Upon sufficient removal of the parasite's life sustaining thiols by oxidation, the parasite rapidly dies. A list of thiols (RSH) upon which survival of Plasmodium species heavily depend includes: lipoic acid & dihydrolipoic acid [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11], coenzyme A & acyl carrier protein [6, 9, 12, 39, 43], glutathione [4, 19, 26, 32, 35, 37], glutathione reductase [33, 34, 42], glutathione - S - transferase [24, 30, 49, 50, 52, 53], peroxiredoxin [40, 56, 57, 58 , 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67], thioredoxin [20, 21, 22, 25, 44, 64], glutaredoxin [31,45], plasmoredoxin [28], thioredoxin reductase [23, 46], ornithine decarboxylase and falcipain [13,14,17,18,51,54].

[8, 13] They accomplish this by ingesting hemoglobin into an organelle known as the \"acid food vacuole\". [3, 16] Incidently, the high concentration of acid in this organelle could serve as an additional site of conversion of chlorite (ClO2 - ) to the more active chlorine dioxide (ClO2) right inside the parasite. Next falcipain (a hemoglobin digesting enzyme) hydrolyzes hemoglobin protein to release its nutritional amino acids. [4, 5, 6, 2 6, 27] A necessary byproduct of this digestion is the release of 4 heme molecules from each hemoglobin molecule digested. [1] Free heme (also known as ferriprotoporphyrin) is redox active and can react with ambient oxygen (O2), an abundance of which is alw ays present in red blood cells. This produces superoxide radical (*OO - ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxidant toxic species. [2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20] These can rapidly poison the parasite internally. To protect itself against this dangerous side - effect of eating blood protein, Plasmodia must continuously and rapidly eliminate heme. [18, 22] This is accomplished by two methods. Firstly, heme is polymerized producing hemozoin. [19, 21, 23, 24] Secondly, heme is metabolized in a detox ification process that requires reduced glutathione (GSH). [17, 25] Therefore any method (including exposure to oxidants) which limits the availability of reduced glutathione will cause a toxic build up of heme inside the parasite cells. Since sodium chlor ite and chlorine dioxide readily oxidize glutathione heme detoxification is inhibited. As these are the exact agents used in Mr. Humble's treatment, the observed effect of killing Plasmodia should be expected. References: 1.

Quinine, chloroquine, mefloquine and other quinoline antibiotics all work by blocking the heme detoxifying system inside the trophozoites. [1, 2, 3 , 4, 5] Many Plasmodial strains against which quinolines have repeatedly been used have found a way to adjust to this"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD Chapter 22 Page 118 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century treatment and to acquire resistance. Recent research has shown, however, that the mechanism of this acquired resistance amounts to a mere upregulation of glutathione production and utilization. [6, 7, 8, 11, 19, 21, 22, 23] Recent research has also shown that oxidizing or otherwise depleting glutathione inside the parasite restores sensitivity to the quinoline antibiotics. [10, 12, 13, 15, 1 6, 18, 20] Therefore, some protocols combining the use of oxidants with quinolines are already showing signs of success. In this regard let us consider that no amount of intraplasmodial glutathione (GSH) could ever resist exposure to a sufficient dose of c hlorine dioxide (ClO2). Note that each molecule of ClO2 can disable 5 molecules of glutathione. 10 GSH + 2 ClO2 - > 5 GSSG + 4 H2O + 2 HCl Living things possess a recovery system to rescue oxidized sulfur compounds. It operates through donation of hy drogen atoms to these compounds and thereby restores their original condition as thiols. [9]2 [H] + GSSG - > 2 GSH A key player in this system is the enzyme glucose - 6 - phosphate - dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Patients with a genetic defect of G6PDH, known as glucos e - 6 - phosphate - dehydrogenase deficiency disease, are especially sensitive to oxidants and to prooxidant drugs. However, this genetic disease has a benefit in that such individuals are naturally resistant to malaria . They can still catch m alaria, but it is much less severe in them, since they permanently lack the enzyme necessary to assist the parasite in reactivating glutathione. [14, 17] Furthermore, G6PDH is profoundly sensitive to inhibition by sodium chlorate (NaClO3), another member of the chlorine oxide family of compounds. Sodium chlorate (NaClO3) is a lesser ingredient present in Jim Humble's antimalarial solution. Some sodium chlorate should also be produced in vivo by a slow reaction of chlorine dioxide with water under slightly alkaline conditions. The Plasmodia may attempt to restore its glutathione that is lost to oxidation. However, this will be difficult or impossible if G6PDH is inhibited by chlorate. Rerences: 1.

Other mechanisms of toxicity of the oxides of chlorine against Plasmodia should also be considered. Oxides of chlorine are generally rapidly reactive with ferrous iron (Fe++). This explains why in cases of overdosed exposures to oxides of chlorine such as sodium chlorite (NaClO2 ) there was a notable rise in methemoglobin levels. Methemoglobin is a metabolically inactive form of hemoglobin in which its ferrous iron (Fe++) cofactor has been oxidized to ferric (Fe+++). Many enzymes in liv ing things employ iron as a cofactor including those in parasites . [8, 9, 10] Thus it is reasonable to expect that any damage to Plasmodia caused by oxides of chlorine is compounded by conversion of ferrous cofactors to ferric. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] References: 1.

[2] When these are lacking pathogen s quit growing and die. [1] Polyamines are also sensitive to oxidation and can be eliminated by strong oxidants. When oxidized, polyamines are converted to aldehydes, which are deadly to parasites and to tumors. Thus any procedure whic h is successful to oxidize polyamines doe’s double damage to the pathogen. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is known to be especially reactive against secondary amines. This includes spermine and spermidine, the two main biologically imp ortant polyamines. References: 1.

So far, at least anecdotally , the dosages of chlorine oxides as administered orally per Jim Humble's protocol have produced no definite toxicity. Some have taken this as often as 1 to 3 times weekly and on the surface seem to suffer no ill effects. To be certain if this is safe, more research is warranted for such long term or repeated use. The concern is that too much or too frequent administration of oxidants could excessively deplete the body's reductants and promote oxidative stress. One useful way to monitor this may be to period ically check methemoglobin levels in frequent users. Sodium chlorite, as found in municipal water supplies after disinfection by chlorine dioxide, has been studied and proven safe. Animal studies using yet higher oral doses have also proven safe. One case of extreme overdose in a suicide attempt caused nearly fatal kidney failure and refractory methemoglobinemia. Special precautions must be employed in cases of glucose - 6 - phosphate - dehydrogenase deficiency disease, as these patients are especially sensitive to oxidants of all kinds. Nevertheless, oral sodium chlorite (NaClO2 ) solutions may yet be found safe and effective in them, but probably will need to be administered at lower doses. MORE RESEARCH It is hoped that this overview will s park a flurry of interest, and stimulate more research into the use of acidified sodium chlorite in the treatment of malaria . The above appreciated observations need to be proven more rigorously and published [8]. The biochemistry most l ikely involved suggests that other members of the phylum Apicomplexa should also be sensitive to this treatment. This phylum includes: Plasmodium, Babesia, Toxoplasma [2], Cryptosporidium [3], Eimeria [4], Theileria, Sarcocystis, Cyclospora, Isospora and N eospora. These agents are responsible for widespread diseases in humans, pets and cattle. Chlorine dioxide has been proven to be cidal to almost all known infectious agents’ in vitro using remarkably low concentrations. This i ncludes parasites [1, 6, 7, 9, and 10], fungi [5], bacteria and viruses . The experiences noted above imply that this compound is tolerable orally at effective concentrations. Therefore extensive r esearch is warranted to determine if acidified sodium chlorite is effective in many other infections. We may be on the verge of discovering the most potent and broad spectrum antibiotic yet known. Special thanks go to Jim Humble for his willingness to shar e his discovery with the world."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Thomas Lee Hesselink, MD Chapter 22 Page 124 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century References: 1.

Well, read this: I’m an elementary school teacher in Hermosillo Mexico in the state of Sonora. My name is Clara Beltrones. I first started using the MMS on May 25 of this year (2007) . My youngest daughter’s tonsils became sw ollen with white spots on them. I took her to the doctor and he prescribed penicillin and anti - inflammatory drops which I gave to her when we returned home. Within ½ hour her whole body started to swell with spots similar to those on her tonsils and she had problems breathing. I took her back to the same doctor who gave her a shot to bring the swelling down. I brought her home and in an hour nothing had happened. So I called Jim Humble and he said give her one drop of MMS and then another drop an hour later. In the first 15 minutes of the first dose , the swelling of her body went back to normal. I took her back to the doctor as I wanted him to see what was going on in her body. The doctor asked what I gave her, because the tonsils were half way down and the spots were gone. I decided not to say anything to the doctor. I came back home and gave her the second drop. This happened during the morning and by that afternoon , she was back to normal except she had a runny nose. The next day she was comple tely clear. Even though I saw it work on my daughter I was still disbelieving of the MMS. However, on June 17 my aunt Patty Velez and her daughter Patty Souza came to see me and I thought to give it to them just to try it out. I then gave both of them six drops of MMS with the necessary lime drops and the 3 minute wait. When they drank it they both mentioned that they felt tingling in their whole body for about fifteen minutes. We waited an hour and they took a second dose of 6 drops. At that time they went home. The next day I called to find out how they were doing. They pointed out that the daughter, Patty Souza, had not had her period for six months, plus she had not yet developed breasts. She had a large chest, but no breasts ha d shown. Yet, that morning breasts about the size of a small lime had begun to develop. At that time I suggested the daughter take another dose on Thursday which was 4 days later. When I called on Thursday she mentioned that her large ch est had formed into full size breasts and she now had her period for the first time in six months. She now says that she feels less nervous and that "},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventure of a Grade School Teacher in Mexico Chapter 2 3 P age 127 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century she is losing a lot of the weight that she needs to lose. She was taking pills from a psychiatrist for dep ression which she no long feels that she needs to take. Her mother also experienced change. She said that she felt much energized and for the first time she was able to sleep through the whole night. She mentioned that she was taking pills prescribed by a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety and pills to go to sleep and pills to wake up in the morning. The first night she was able to sleep and did not take the pills. The second day the back pain and leg pain that she had been experiencing for many ye ars was gone. She also stopped taking the pills for depression and anxiety because she no longer needs them. She is a nurse and understands the need or no need for such pills. It’s now two months later and both the mother and daughter are still doing we ll. On June 26 my daughter Alejandra age 5 woke up very swollen in her entire body. She could hardly see out of her eyes . She had a pain on her lower right side of her stomach and she was throwing up because of the extreme pain. I took her to the emergency room and they admitted her and did a blood test , urine test, and X - rays and all came out positive to acute appendicitis. They began to program her for an operation immediately as an emergency. I decided to see ab out having her operation at a local private hospital. They started doing the paperwork for the transfer; in the meantime she was in observation. I went to the car, got my bottle of MMS and a lime that I had thought to bring in the car in case I might need it, and prepared her a 6 drop dose. I had her drink it like she was drinking a glass of water. The doctor noticed that the swelling on her body began to reduce and the pain was almost gone in about 20 minutes. So they kept her in obse rvation and after 3 hours of paper work and observation there was no longer any swelling or pain. So the doctor asked me if I gave her anything and I said nothing. He asked several times but knowing doctors I decided it best to say nothing. The doctor d ecided to have another set of tests. The blood test, urine test, and the X - rays all came out negative for appendicitis. I asked for the results of the tests, but the doctor would only allow me to have the second set of tests which I now have at home. Wh en we came home she had a severe pain in her stomach and she run to the restroom and had much water and green stuff come out. That was the end of it. I did not give her a second dose. On July 6 I visited Liz Chan who complained of back pain, leg pain, and that she has not been able to sit down because she gets cramps in her legs. She has had the cramp problem since she was 18 when she had her tonsils removed. At that time she began having rheumatoid arthritis and varicose veins. So I decided to give her six drops with the lime and 3 minutes wait and then a similar dose after one hour. After the first dose in about 15 minutes her lower back pain went away and she was able to sit down and stand up"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventure of a Grade School Teacher in Mexico Chapter 2 3 P age 128 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century with no problem. The next morning she called and said she had no pain and she was able to sit up with no problem. She was amazed with the results. On the third day of taking the six drops each night her varicose veins were still the same size but th e pain was gone. She felt a lot of energy. On August 8 she told me she had lost 10 pounds of weight and on August 9 th she got diarrhea for a whole day and I had her take lemon aid and salt to overcome any dehydration. On August 10 she w ent camping and she was able to walk over 4 miles without pain or tiring. During the process she noticed that the fungus that had been on the bottom of her foot for over 5 years had disappeared. She also feels that her skin is in much better condition. Also she has noticed that all cramping before her period is now gone. Martha, a lady that owns a small grocery store near my house one morning complained about a pain in the neck caused by lying wrong. I had her come to my house and gave her the two si x drop doses at one hour between each dose. The pain in her neck went away on the first dose. Now she keeps a MMS bottle in her store and treats people in the neighborhood and those who bring products to the store. For example, one person who had a toot h ache she had him wash his mouth with 15 drops of MMS, activated with lime , the 3 wait and with water added. The pain went away immediately. She began treating her mother who suffers from emphysema. The disease was so bad that the docto rs could give her no hope. She also has rheumatoid arthritis . When I saw her the first time she was laying with oxygen and not able to move. On the first dose of 6 drops she vomited white stuff. With the second dose after an hour s he felt OK and went to sleep with no need for oxygen. The next day she felt so good that she wanted to go outside. She was able to get up from bed with no help. There was still pain but it was less than 50% of what it was according to her evaluation. O n the third day it was raining and yet the pain was even less and she was able to walk around the house with the help of a walker. She takes the 6 drops every night and now she plans to start increasing the number of drops. It is now 8 days later, and sh e has said what she likes about the drops is that they make her vomit a lot of mucus every other day and that she always feels much better after vomiting. Now she only uses oxygen now and then. Martha (the daughter) personally takes drops every time she feels nervous and anxious and that calms her down right away. My mother suffered from both acid reflux and hemorrhoids which caused her lower intestines to become inflamed for many years. The first time she took the MMS she took a full 15 drops wit h the vinegar instead of lime . She said she felt nothing from the drops, but the second day she got diarrhea and she took another 15 drops. She vomited for about 3 hours and the only thing she took was lemonade with sal t to hydrate her body. She felt very week. The"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventure of a Grade School Teacher in Mexico Chapter 2 3 P age 129 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century third day she didn’t take any drops but she felt good with a lot of energy. She was afraid to eat, but she did eat a little fruit for breakfast and nothing for lunch. At dinner she went ahead and had a stak e with a lot of salsa. She had no problem with digestion and she noticed no burning problem. After that she took 6 drops for about 2 months and one day she decided that she needed to clean herself out. She then went to 10 drops and then to 11 drops and t hen she began vomiting bright orange material and she felt weak and remained in bed with diarrhea. The next day she took 12 drops and after an hour she threw up dark green material only 4 times that day. Finally the throw up material was orange again and she began feeling better and had one meal. On the third day she awoke feeling really great with lots of energy and has been feeling good ever since. She continues to take the MMS and she has lost 6 pounds so far. Her stomach is much smaller in size now . There’s one other case I would like to tell you about. My son, Carlos, who is 12 years old has had Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) all of his life. I have always paid to have him attend special schools. This year the tuition is $2000 US. A cost no t easily obtained in Mexico. The"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The MMS Adventure of a Grade School Teacher in Mexico Chapter 2 3 Page 130 The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century ADD often comes with poor conduct and poor social abilities. And that was especially in the case with Carlos. It was hard for me, his mother, to keep him doing his chores. He did not get along with the other children and he was what I considered a continuous problem. And then one evening a couple of months ago I started him off, the same as everyone else, with a 6 drop dose, of course with the lemon juice, three minute wait and the n added juice. He took the second similar dose one hour later, and has been taking 6 drop doses every evening. After about two weeks his attitude began to change. He began being nicer to me, and to the other children. There has been no fighting inciden ts and Carlos has become a very well behaved child and seems quite appreciative of other people. He hasn’t started to school yet, but I am anxious to see how his grades will be. -- I hope you have as good results as I have had. Clara Beltrones. Note fr om the Author: As you can see here Clara has been using a little different protocol than I have suggested in this book in that I usually suggest starting at 2 drops of MMS or less. However, it is hard to argue with success. Clara has now treated more th an 45 people using the six drop first dose and she always waits an hour before giving them a second dose. In discussing the cases with her, she almost always noti ces quite a bit of burping with in 15 minutes or so. Most of the people here in this desert c ity of Hermosillo vomit white or colored mucus within the first several hours, often after they go home from taking the t wo 6 drop doses. She always warns them that they will probably vomit at first and so far they have all agreed to go ahead and take the 6 drop doses. All the cases that Clara has treated has reported feeling really great, or better than they have felt for years. There has been a positive result from everyone, and many of them have gotten positive results with their loved ones. If you look at protocol number 3 at the end of Chapter 10 you will notice that I have added the 6 and 6 protocol. This protocol seems to work very good in many cases. Please read the protocol and use it when it seems warranted. Good fortune and Good luck.
