For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? 4 For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 5 But ye say, It is an offering by It is an offering by It is an offering by It is an offering by which ye may be profited by me which ye may be profited by mewhich ye may be profited by me which ye may be profited by me; 6 And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
