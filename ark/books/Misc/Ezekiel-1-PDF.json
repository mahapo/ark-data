Whereas 1:10 had ascribed f our different faces to each of the cherubim, the plain reading of the Hebrew here points to four identical faces for each cherub, with each cherub having a different set. Whereas 1:10 had followed a human - lion - bull - eagle sequence, 10:14 lists them as cheru b - human - lion - eagle. This reordering raises two questions. Why was the bull face displaced, and how is the cherubic face to be perceived? Any answer to the first is speculative. . . . While we cannot be sure how the ancients perceived true cherubic faces, some evidence suggests that they were not human. On the other hand, the contradiction at least in the order of faces is more appar ent than real. Since the inaugural vision came to the prophet from the north, the frontal view (south) would have had a human face, with the other three being arranged as follows: 1   1 Daniel Isaac Block, The Book of Ezekiel, Chapters 1 – 24 (The New International Commentary on the Old Testament; Grand Rapids, MI: Wm.

Why the present enumeration commences with the cherub instead of the human face is unclear, but it may reflect the vantage fr om which the prophet observed the chariot. In order to witness the kābôd lifting from cherubim inside the temple, he must have been standing at the front of the building, perhaps at the eastern gate of the inner court. From this viewpoint, he naturally beg an with the creature facing him. Beyond these changes, the description of the chariot agrees with the earlier account and requires no further comment. 2 Comments on the four faces and their relation to the zodiac: Philip Carrington, The Primitive Christian Calendar: A Study in the Making of the Marcan Gospel (Cambridge University Press, 2016; originally published 1952) , p. 66 See Maunder, As tronomy of the Bible, 166 for basically the same information.   2 Ibid., 325."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Carrington quotes Franz Boll in the above , whose book is perhaps the ma jor resource for an astronomical approach to the book of Revelation.

But he wasn ’ t a biblical scholar, either. Conseq uently , I agree with Thompson ’ s criticism of Boll at the above URL – and hence other astral - theological interpreters of Revelation.

In other words, scholars like Boll and Malina drastically overstat e their case to the neglect of what John was doing in Revelation. Nevertheless, the other side of the coin is also flawed – that interpreting Revelation has nothing to do with astronomical events and objects. It very obviously does in certain instances. It ’ s not an either - or choice. "}]
