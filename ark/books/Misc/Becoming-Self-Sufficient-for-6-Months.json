[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Becoming Self-Sufficie nt for Six Months by Pande mic Flu Information Contributor “Dr Dave” Revised June 17, 2007 INT RODUCTI ON Although this document is s omewhat speculative in nature, it contains a variety of pragmatic cautionary statements, health advi sories, and domestic survi val tips that have been derived fro m authoritative scient ific and e mpirical sources. Ordinarily, I would pro vide an appropriate fo otnote citation whenever I state a fact that is not con- sidered general knowledge within a particu lar field of study; however, time constraints and confidentiality is sues have not permitte d that particular aca demic exercise. You will notice that this documen t tends to focus primarily on how to prepare for, and cope with, the econo mic impact of an infl uenza pandemic. Ce rtainly, the impendin g pandemic provided the initial motivation fo r this writing, but the need for personal self-sufficiency is certainly not restricted t o pandemics. I ndeed, most of the advice in this document could be adapted to a variety of situati ons in whi ch the production or distribution of goods and services becomes disrupted for more than a day or two. Con- sidering how vulnerab le we are to disaster s, both natural and man-made, and consid- ering that each disaster may have economi c consequences that could affect your fam- ily’s well-being, it si mply makes good s ense for every househol d to prepare to b e self- sufficient for a certai n duration of time. Th e greate r the level of self-suf ficiency yo u can achieve right now, the lower the impact of an econo mic disruption or eme rgency. THE PAN DEM IC SC ENAR IO There are 144 known strains of avian influenza. H5N1 is merely one of them, and many more strains of flu come from ma mmals, su ch as pigs, horses, a nd monkey s. Historically, the global flu pand emic rate i s at least three per century (ther e were 10 recorded pandemics in the last 300 years), so it is re ally not a matter of if the next pandemic will occur, it is simply a matter of when . Do bear in mind that thi s particu- lar strain of flu is n ot like an ordinary se asonal flu that affects us during the winter months, ki lling an average of 36,000 Americans each year. H5N1 is much deadlier, both to bir ds and to humans. As of toda y, June 17 th , 2007, the mortality rate in hu- mans has reached 75%. The H5N1 virus has k illed bi rds in at least 56 countries and it has killed humans in at least 11 countries. It has also evolved into at leas t 6 distinct sub-strains, or clades, each of which has infected and killed human beings. Unfortunately, no vaccine can be develo ped until the genetic material of H5N1 evolves, or reassorts, into a clade that ca n be readily transmitted from hu man to hu - man. Even then, after a vaccine is successfully produced (a pro cess that takes about six months from start to fini sh), it will n ot be immed iately avai lable t o th e general public. Since global flu vaccine production capability is only about 500 million courses per year, the first several mill ion will undoubt edly be distributed exclusively to politi- Becom i ng Se lf -Suf fic ient f o r Six Mo nth s pag e 1 © ClarkWardOrange Visit Our EBay Store ClarkWardOrange “ Click Here \" Visit Our EBay Store ClarkWardOrange “ Click Here \""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cal leaders, military personnel, and civilians who ho ld mission- critical jobs in such fields as m edicine, la w enforce ment, and pub lic utilities. Therefore, you might not be able to vaccinate your family until after th e pandemic has passed . To complicate mat- ters, Tamif lu , the drug that is given to patients wi th severe flu, is difficult to obtain and is not effective unless it is administered within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. So, get you r Tamiflu A.S.A.P. After the pandemic starts it will be too late. When H 5N1 does eve ntually evolve into a cl ade that is easily transmitted from person to person, it is expected to lose some of its lethality, but it could still be far deadlier than any flu the world has ever experienced. Many epidemiolog ists estima te that 50 % of the glob al populati on will bec ome sick with the flu and that 10% of the flu patients will die. This would result in 300 mill ion deaths worldwide. In the United States alone, that would be approxima tely 15 millio n deaths . Even if only 33% of Americans become ill and only 1% die, that would stil l be a loss of 1 milli on people. Although nobody can predict when the H5N1 virus will finally give rise to a severe pandemic, the World Health Organization beli eves t hat it is ju st a matter of time. This is be- cause migr ating birds continue t o spread th e virus to domesticated birds, and because there are million s of people all around th e world (including the U.S.A.) who live in close proxi mity to domesticated birds. Th ese factors create a recipe for disaster, since it gives the virus numerous oppo rtunities to perform the genetic reassortments neces- sarily for effective human to human transmission. In addition to the ri sk from infected bird s, there is a growing concern o ver H 5N1’s potential t o infect a variety of m ammals–not just hu mans. The re are confi rmed cases of dogs and cats, both feral and domesticat ed, that have died of H 5N1. The reports about cats is especially disturbing because cats have never had flu before. So, if it is true that the virus is capable of spreading to a variety of mammals, this could indicate that the much-feared genetic reassortments are takin g place and that human to hu - man transmission is now inevitable. Y ou shou ld als o bear in mind that thousands of people hav e died from “flu-like” illnes ses, but were never tested for H5N1, and there are cases that were confirmed pos t mortem , but did n ot test positive initially; there- fore, it is impossible t o know just how far this flu has already spread. The infection and death rates from the 1 918 “Spanish Flu” su ggest that over the course of a severe pandemic lasting severa l months, at least 33% of the global popula - tion will ev entually become ill with the flu. Therefore, we could expect that H5N1 will make one-third of the world’s labor force t oo sick to work for at least two weeks per person. I n addition to the hour s lost to employee il lness, the g lobal labor force could certainly s uffer from an indefinite period of voluntary absenteeis m, as healthy people begin to practice “soci al distancing” in an attempt to avoid contact with thos e who ma y be infected. There co uld also be a subs tantial number of otherwise healthy workers who must remain at h ome for weeks or m onths to care for sick family members; and, if schools an d day-care centers are obliged t o close their doors, a lo t of workin g parents would have no choice but to remain at home with their children indefinitely. Beyond the se temporary labor problems, su bstant ial as they may be, it is likely that at least 100 million workers around the world will die from the next flu pandemic, in - cluding tho usands of people who hold jobs that affect your family’s lifestyl e.

Therefore, when any such disrupti ons do occur, you will certainly want yo ur family to b e prepared with the resources and knowledge for coping as com fortably as possible for as long as necessary. How long is really necessary? If we are really lucky, it could be only a few weeks, but it will probably be several months. Although i n a typical flu patient the very worst s ymptoms may come and go within a matter of a few days, it could take many w eeks for the flu to make its way through an entire community–a nd that is just for t he first wa ve. Flu pan demics typ ically occu r in two or three global waves, stretched out over a year or more. Consequen tly, people who did not become s ick from the first wave would still be at risk of getting the flu during any subsequent w aves. It is important to note that a pandemic w ave does not have a clearly defined beginning or end. A wave is merely a period of time during which a whole lot of people b ecome s ick m ore or l ess simultaneo usly. Between waves, however, many people will still be recoveri ng and m ore people will become sick. Un- fortunately, it is the human interaction betw een the waves that is largely responsible for generating subsequent waves. You see, as flu cases diminish, people will let down their guard and begi n to return to their old routines, even though the flu is still pre- sent in their communities. This unguarde d behavior is what tends to cause the next wave. In addition, the virus may continue to mutate, possibly acquiring the ability to reinfect and kill peopl e who had previously survived it. Since there will b e no time p eriod during th e pandem ic in which it will b e completely safe to expose yoursel f to others, the only sure-fire way to prevent infection will be to isolate you r family in your home and wait it out; and, s ince each wave could easily la st two or th ree months in any give n community, wi th a month-long recovery p eriod after each wave, you might feel compel led to isola te your family for one full year. While you may not find it absolutely necessary to comp letely withdraw fr om society for such a long time, you may h ave to co pe with seve ral months of econom ic disruptions during the pandemic and several more months of di sruption afterward. Even conservative pandemic predictions assume that most co mmunities will experience limited availabil- ity of com modities a nd services for at leas t a couple o f weeks. Mainstream predictions, however, assume that there will be varying degrees of nation-wide economic disruption lasting several months which wi ll only bec ome worse as time go es by. These disrup- tions will b e foll owed by a lingering global recession la sting over a year. Although it is improb able that a ny town in the United States would have to cope with a total and simultaneous collaps e in the distribution of food, medicine, utilities, and public services for more than a few weeks at a time, it is highly l ikely that every com- munity w ill have to adjust to sporadic and repeated disruptions over a period of sev- eral months. Some di sruptions may be in termittent, but some may linger for quite a while. However, since you can not know in advance which goods or services will be unavailable in your town, or for how long you might have to get by without them, it would be p rudent to prepare for complete an d total independence and self-sufficiency within your own home for the minimum duration of a global pandemic, which is esti- mated to b e at least six months. That leve l of prepara tion would reduce the impact of the disruptions and would provide a great me asure of comfort for your entire family.

Then ask yourself which food items in yo ur kitchen you can easily do without and which items you would really li ke to have on a regular basis. For example, if you could not purchase milk or bread for a week or two, how would th at affect yo ur family? What if you could not purchase milk or bread for seve ral weeks? What if th e prospect of going to a grocery store was too risky to even consider? Food shortages should be anticipated, but even if there were plenty of groceries on the sto re shelves, during a pandemic you would want to a void close co ntact wi th others, so going t o a grocer y store might pose an unacceptabl e health risk, both to you and th e folks back home. Consider this: you could physically distance yourself from others and dress appropri- ately, wearing an N10 0 respirator and nitrile gloves while shoppi ng, yet the possibil ity exists that you will unknowingly bring the fl u virus ho me from the market. It could be on your groceries. This is because the it ems in your grocer y b ags were h andled by humans, and in a severe pande mic at leas t 33% of those huma ns will eventually get the flu. By the way, an infected person can spread the flu a day or two be fore symp- toms appear, so how would you know if sick shopper or a soon- to-be-sick retail clerk coughed or sneezed o n one your grocery items before you arrive d? Simpl y put, you ca n not know, and since t he influ enza virus can ea sily survive on the exterior of a package for 48 hour s or more, you would be compelled to sanitize or quarantine everything you bought before bringing it into yo ur home. Clearly, at some point in time shopping will be an activity to avo id until long after th e pandemic has passed, so you need to get busy right now and begin stocking up. He re is a practical way of going about it: ♦ Set a calor ic goal for your household that is based upon the basal metabolic rate and anticipated energy expenditure of each person. For example, an active family of four, with a combin ed weight of 570 pou nds, will n eed 1,460,0 00 calories for six months. T his caloric goal assum es that eac h person will burn 14 calories p er day per pound of body we ight. However, to merely maintain any given weight, a sed- entary person will on ly need ab out 11 calo ries per da y per pound of body weight. So, a sedentary family of four that has a combined weight of 570 pounds wi ll only require 1,144,000 calories for a s ix month peri od of time. Just for reference, both the United Nations and the World H ealth Organization have based their emer- gency food rations on a 2,100 calorie per day diet, but this assumes physical labor. ♦ Develop and maintai n a food s torage sho pping list or inventory sheet that will help you focus on buying products that co ntribute to your nutriti onal goals. ♦ Be sure that you can provide each person with 25 to 30 grams of fiber and 50 to 70 grams of protein per day. Try not to worr y too much about fats and carboh ydrates. If you are careful about the calories you consume, they will all get burned up any- way. Instead, try to stock up on foods you will actually eat. ♦ Establish a deadline for purchas ing your e mergency food and stick with it by buy- ing at least an extra week’s worth of groceries every time you shop. ♦ Stock up heavily on f oods that a re part of your normal diet, but which require no refrigerati on and are easy to prepare witho ut the aid of modern appliances. ♦ Check the expiration date of each item befo re you put it into your shopping cart, so Becom i ng Se lf -Suf fic ient f o r Six Mo nth s pag e 4 © ClarkWardOrange"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you do not buy food that will be out of code in less than 7 or 8 mon ths. ♦ For canned goods, select sizes that your fa mily will eat in one meal. In the event of a power failure during mild weather, yo u will not be able to preserve leftovers. ♦ For maximum shelf lif e, store your food in a cool, dark place and rotate your stock. ♦ Protect your food from insects and rodents. ♦ When you are no lon ger able to shop nor mally, consume the perishable items in your refrigerator first, followed by the item s in your fre ezer. Only when these two sources are depleted should you consume yo ur emergency food. As you begin to purchase food f or your si x month emergency su pply, you need to be aware of how much it costs to buy 8,000 cal ories of food (one day of meals for an a ctive family of fo ur). I f you are not co nscientious ly acquiring high calorie foods, y ou may be surprised at just ho w expensive it can be to stock u p. On the other han d, it can b e really chea p. For exa mple, at S am’s Club, you can purchase a 9 pound box of Quaker brand oatmeal for about $6.88. Each box contains 100 servings and each serving pro- vides 150 calories. That works out to about 7¢ per 15 0 calorie serving. By contrast, a 15 ounce can of green beans contains onl y 70 calories. So, if you can still purchas e green beans for 50¢ per can, it will cost you $1.07 for 150 calories’ worth. Therefore, to purchas e 8,000 calories’ worth of these two products, the oatmeal will cost less than $4, but the green bea ns will cost over $57. Of course, nobody wants to live entirely on oatmeal or green beans, but if the budget for your e mergency food supply is limited, you will need information on the cost per day of your food choices . You might be interest ed to know that there are quite a few food items that can supply a family with 8,000 calories for a very low cost. When purchased in large quantities, white rice, pasta, lentils, sugar, peanut bu tter, who le wheat flour, ramen, popcorn, and tortilla chips can each supply 8,000 calories for less than $3. In the ra nge of $3 to $4 for 8,000 calories, you can al so buy corn meal, brownie mix, canola oil, split peas, brown sugar, peanuts, and oatmeal. When vi ewed from this perspective , a family of four could easily acquire a one month supply of fairly basic emergency foo d for unde r $100, so s ix months should not b e out of rea ch. Now, if your emergency supply budge t can go as high as $10 per day for a family of four, you can also in clude such desirable foods as Bisquick, sa ltine crackers, graha m crackers , walnuts, red beans, chocolate, Doritos, muffin mixes, pancake mix, strawb erry jam, pinto beans, vanilla wafers, Oreos, mayonnaise, honey, Nestle’s Quik, an d powdered milk. These dai ly costs are based upon actual purchase prices from Sam’s Club, Wa l-Mart, Dominick’s, J ewel, and Walgreen’s in northern Illinois d uring the summer of 2006. Although a carefully stocked refrigerator can easily store 100,000 calories’ worth o f food, you should probably not include any refr igerated items as part of your emergency food supply. Unless you can quickly repl ace the items you consume, your stockin g levels will always be unreliable, varying from day to day. Inste ad, you should merely consider your cold sto rage foods as “bonus” items. On the other hand, you may wish to start thinking about how you can maintain a certain stocking level of high-value foods that can remain frozen for several months, like butt er, meat, and nuts. Of course, without a reliable generator and a good s upply of fuel, your cold storage foods are at risk of spoiling during a prolonge d power fa ilure, but the longer you can get by on the food in you r refrigerator and freezer, the lo nger your e mergency food supply will last.

Toilet paper and toothpaste should come to mind, a s should v itamins, m edications, and feminine hygiene products. In fact, the list of commodities that you will want to have is probably quite extensive; but, just like the prob lem with groceries, the problem with household supplies is going to be the unpredicta ble impact of the pandemic on product availabil ity. Even if you are willin g to go shopping, and even if you are will- ing to sanitize or quarantine the products that you buy, you really do not know ho w the pandemic will affect the pro duction or distribution of the things you need.

Fortunately, most of these items are not perishable, a nd many are compact, so you m ay wish to consider obtaining a one-year supply of every household commodity that your family will want to have, both during and after a pandemic.

[A cytokine storm is an especiall y lethal medical phenomenon. In brief, if the immune system of a healthy, young adult over-react s to a stro ng flu vi rus and sends too many cytokine cells into the lungs, it will lead to rapid inflammation of the lungs and death by suffocation. The cytokine storm was the leading cause of death during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic and is presently the leading cause of death for victims of the H5N1 vi rus.

No w, imagine that shortly after the electricity goes out, your community is u nable to pump clean water to your home. Since a ny given utility is often dependent upon the servic es of one or more other utilities, if your town lost electricity it would eventually los e its public water supply, too. This is be- cause mun icipal water filtration systems a nd distribution pumps need elect ricity, and their back-up generators will eventually run ou t of fuel. So, if your town lost both electricity and water, how woul d they process raw sewage? Eve n if your home had an alternate source of water, such as a well or a stream, would you still b e able to us e your toilets if the local sanitary district could not accept you r sewage? And wha t about garb age pick-up or natura l gas? At what point would these services stop? Over a period of time, disruptions in supply chains and staffing could make it impossi- ble for uti lity companies and public services to operate normally. Of course, your community may be fortunate enough to experi ence onl y sporadic disruptions; however, it may very well have to endure a complete shutdown of one or more utili ties or ser- vices for an extended period of time.

So, unless you are prepared to be completely self-sufficiency fo r wa ter, h eat, light, sanitation, and perso nal safety–all at the same time for at least a month or two–yo ur home could become qu ite unlivable. Apart from the pre ssing need to keep your family warm, clean, and well-fed, yo u should also think about how to keep them safe.

CO OK IN G WITH OU T YOUR K ITCH EN If you have no utilities and no way to prepare hot meals without the aid of your kitchen appliances, you may have to survive on cold, ready-to-eat foods. In itially, tha t may not prove to be much of a problem, bu t unless you have invested heavily in ready- to-eat foods, you will eventually run out of things you can serve without co oking. For economic reasons, em ergency food supplies ar e often built around large quantities of low-cost grain products that can tolerate lo ng-term storage. Thes e are ite ms such as beans, oatmeal, pasta, lentils, s plit peas, wh eat, and rice–all of which must be cooked. You may e ven discover that half of your e mergency food calorie s are locked up in dry grain products. This should not present mu ch of problem, ho wever, because with a good camp stove and a decent supply of cooki ng fuel, you can avail yourself of all those grains and prepare hot food for every meal. Fortunately, cookin g with camp stoves is cheap and easy, so there is reall y no excuse for serving cold food, even in a prolonged emergency situation. H ere are some tips fo r cooking without modern appliances: ♦ Acquire at least one c amp stove that burn s Coleman li quid fuel a nd a second stove that burns propane. Propane camp stoves are very safe for indoor cooki ng, but they cost a lot more t o operate t han liqui d fuel stoves. Save the propane stove for use when the weather is bad or when it is simply not safe to coo k outdoors. ♦ Some camp stoves are dual-fuel capable, which means they can b urn both Coleman liquid fuel and regular unleaded gasoline. These stoves are inexpensive, so you might think about bu ying two or three and saving one for use as a back-up. ♦ Measure the rate at which your stoves consume fuel, then acquire a 6 month sup- ply for each one. Plan for an average of 20 minutes of cooking time for each meal. This rate of consumption will all ow you to boil large kettles of pasta or beans. ♦ If you can not find Coleman l iqu id fuel, you can still s tore enough cooking f uel for a dual-fuel stove for months: fill up a couple of 5 gallon gas cans. A 10,000 BTU burner, operating for an hour each day, will only use a bout two gallons per month. ♦ Although Coleman li quid fuel i s highly refined and has chemical stabilizers for long-term storage, you still need t o rota te your stock to keep it fres h. ♦ If you become sick, your family members will have to cook for you, so whi le condi- tions are s till normal , be sure t o have everyone become famil iar with the stoves. Show them how to setup, light, cook, clean, re-fuel, and store each stove. ♦ Have at least two manual can openers for all those ca nned goods.

If you do, you will surely want prot ection. From a practical perspective, there is really nothing that can provide a 100% gu arantee that you will not get the flu while you are out in public, but there are a few re asonabl e steps you can take that will help you defend yourself. Before you even step out to get the mail, put on a pai r of dispos able gloves . You hav e probably heard this b h So, if you do come into contact with somet hing that i s contaminated, and i f you then touch your nose, your mouth, or your eyes , you can introduce that very contaminant directly int o your body. You may pick it up from “who-knows-where” and it may go right from your hand to your face and make you sick. That is why hand washing is so important. Really, you absolut ely must put on a pair of disposable gloves before you come into contact wit h any obje ct tha t ha s the remotest possibility of being contami- nated. This includes such everyday things as shoppi ng carts, doorknobs, gas pumps, mail, money, gro ceries, newspapers, pets, an d people–in fact, any object that you have not personally quarantined or sanitized. Apart from frequent h and washing and the religious u se of d ispo sable glove s, the most important thing you can do to protect y T contain the virus. Sin ce viruses are transm itted easily from person to person through the aerosol cocktail of saliva an d mucus that is ejec ted by coughs and sneezes, it is essential t hat you filter out these contaminat ed airborne droplets before they get into your lungs. That is where the respirator co mes in. A respirator is a passive air filter that you wear over your nose and mouth. The most common on e may be t he disposa ble N95, w hich is a th ing much protection against the flu. The reasons are as follows: most N95 disposable respirators have a “one size fits all” design , so the perimeter fit is poor; the cheapest N95 respirators lack an exhalation valve, so the peri meter fit i s disturbed when yo u exhale; the filter degrades from the water vapor that you exhale; and, the designation of “95” mea ns that onl y 95% of the particles that are 0.3 mi crons or larger will actually be filtered out. That allows 5% of the pote ntially infected particles to pass by the filter and enter your mouth or nose. Given these flaws, you should not rely upon N95s fo r protection. What you really need are N 100 disposables and P100 reusable h alf-masks. Use the disposable N 100s for limited service when the transmission risk is low, and use the P1 00 half-ma sks for extended service in close quarters. If you must care for someone w ho has the flu, you will also n eed a face shield to protect your eyes from direct cont act with a nything th at is ejecte d by a cough or snee ze. For additional pro- tection, have unvented N95s or simple ear- loop medical masks for the patient to wear.

The in- tent of this action is to activate a social di stancing plan that will reduce the rate of flu transmission and the reby prevent the collapse of the electric grid, fuel distribution, food production, public water, commodity supply cha ins, banking, law en forcement, medical care, the stock market, and society as w e know it. I n tandem w ith planned school closi ngs, the CDC has pro posed a variety of social distancing ideas. [Social distancing can take many forms, incl uding the modification of social greetings to exclude handshaking, huggin g, and kissing. It cou ld also extend to the temporary suspension of any activity that brings large groups of people toge ther, such as sporting events, carnivals, plays, concerts, et cete ra. For the full mitigation p h .] weeks if you only have nough food for the first two? Clearly, yo u need more. Yet, if you go sh opping, yo u For ose of you who really are in tent on se eing your children survive this pandemic, Unfortunat ely, the C DC has failed to suggest how to endure a twelve week period o f social dista ncing and school clos ures. Ther e seem s to be a certain degree of disconnect here, because their r ecommendation for st ocki ng up on food and water re mains at two weeks. So, how do yo u keep your kids safely at home for twelve e might bring the flu home in your groceries. To make matters wo rse, this plan to close schools for twelve we eks merely addresses mitigation for the first wave of the pan- demic. It does not include any recommendat ions for coping with subsequ ent waves. Another potential flaw in the C DC’s mitigation plan is the effect it m ight have on the virus. For example, if the first wave is prot racted o ver a period of ten or twe lve weeks, rather tha n be permitted to run its normal course ov er a span of only fou r to eight weeks, the virus will have a mu ch larger wi ndow of opportunity for evolving and reas- sorting into a form that can reinfect people who had previously survived it. The net effect of this could be the inadvertent gene ration of a second pandemic-causing virus and the emergence of a second global pande mic, even before the fi rst one died out. Certainly, this new m itigation plan offers us m ore hope for survival than anything the CDC has offered previously, but it gives no direction for stocking your sh elves or for staying warm. Y ou have to do that yourself. It does, however, sanction an action that we already k new was n ecessary: to get your k ids h ome and k eep them h ome. th twelve weeks away from school will not be enough. What you really need is a plan that will keep your entire family complete ly out of harm’s way until all danger has passed. So, start wi th six months’ worth of supplies , increase i t to a full year if you can, and then evaluate your situation to be sure that you really will be comp letely self- sufficient for as long as it takes. After all, if the global case fatality ra te is much more than 5%, we may have to live in rustic, 19 th century con ditions for a couple of years.
