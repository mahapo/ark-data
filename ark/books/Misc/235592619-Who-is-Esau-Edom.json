INTRODUCTION The title of this book poses a question which may well prove to be the most important question in understanding the B ible, history and world events. Who is Esau - Edom? Esau was the firstborn son of lsaac who was the son of Abraham, with whom God had made a special covenant with. The Bible story tells us that Esau would have a des tiny unique and separate from that of his twin brother Jacob. The dissimilar and conflicting destinies of these two individuals would affect the course of history to the present day. This material presents the “ strong meat ” of God ’ s word which is intende d to edify and nourish strong Christians (Heb. 5:12 - 14). It thus is specifically intended for those who have advanced to the stage of understanding the racial perspective of the Bible. In revealing the mysteries of Scripture surrounding Esau - Edom, this boo k deals with history, prophecy, ethnology, providence, symbology, and eschatology. 1 This book traces the life and destiny of Esau and his descendants, the Edomites, and their relationship to Jacob - Israel, to God, to historical and current events, and to other races, plus their place in prophecy and judgment. A main goal of this material is to reveal the plans and ways of God regarding the role of Esau and his descendants in the world. Thus, this book may well provide the definitive answers to some of t he world ’ s most perplexing questions. 1 Eschatology gives a presentation of ideas regarding the ultimate condition of the world and of man as is represented in Scripture. Broadly, it includes also ideas regarding events leading to the end."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Legacy of Esau - Edom? 5 ----- 1 ----- THE LEGACY OF ESAU - EDOM To help answer the question of who is Esau - Edom, the first necessary step is to examine the racial and genealogical history of Esau and his descendants. Life and History of Esau Esau was the first born of Isaac, and thus was heir to the birthright derived from the direct racial lineage of Adam to Noah to Abraham. Thus Esau was racially an Adamite, a Semite, and a Hebrew - the racial stock of the white race. Just as “ Esau despised his birthright ” (Ge n. 25:34) when he sold it to Jacob, he also despised his race by marrying strange women outside of his race. Esau married the daughters of Canaan or Canaanites (Gen. 28:6; 36:2), the daughters of Heth or Hittites (Gen. 26:34; 27:46; 36:2), the daughters of Ishmael (Gen. 28:9; 36:3), the daughters of the Hivites (Gen. 36:2), and had intermarried with the Horites (Gen. 36:19 - 21; Jasher 30:28). These interracial marriages “ were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah, ” Esau ’ s parents (Gen. 26:35). The descendants of Esau from these marriages became known as “ Edomites ” or as “ Edom ” (Gen. 36:1, 9). The Edomites also possessed some Israelite blood by intermarriages as in the case of Solomon (1 Kings 11:1). Esau and the Edomites dwelt in mount Seir (Gen. 36:8 - 9), whi ch God gave to Esau for a possession (Deut. 2:5, Joshua 24:4). This land was also known as “ Idumea ” (Isa. 34:6). The land of Edom, mount Seir, lied south of "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 Who is Esau - Edom? the Dead Sea, stretching south to its seaport at Elath (Deut. 1:2; 2:1, 8), and included the ravine known as Petra.   A map showing the extent of the Israel Kingdom at the time of David ’ s death (c. 1000 B.C.), and the location of the land of Edom which David had conquered. After the conquest of J udah by the Babylonians, some of the Edomites who had mixed with the “ Jews ” in their land, resettled with them in Judea (Jer. 40:11 - 12). Two centuries later all of Edom was driven out of Mt. Seir. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Legacy of Esau - Edom? 7 The Edomites were driven from Petra westward by t he Nabatheans in 312 B.C., and before the middle of the second century B.C. they were occupying, not only southern Judah, but also Hebron and the country to its north as far as Bethzur (1 Mac. 4:29; 5:65). 1 The Nabatheans now occu pied Mt. Seir and the Edomites were driven into the old territory of Judah. The Maccabean family (a remnant of the true Judahites) had ruled Judea from 166 to 37 B.c., and under Judas Maccabee (I Mac. 5:3), recaptured the city of Hebron from the Edomites i n 164 B.c. During the time of John Hyrcanus (135 - 105 B.C.), the nephew of Judas, the Judahites were again faced with the hostility of the Idumeans. Hyrcanus confronted the Edomites causing a decisive change in the relations between the two factions: John Hyrcanus conquered the whole of Edom and undertook the forced conversion of its inhabitants to Judaism (Joseph., Ant. XIII, 9, 1). Thenceforth the Edomites became a section of the Jewish people. 2 Thus, at this juncture of time the Edomites “ were then inc orporated with the Jewish nation, and their country was called by the Greeks and Romans ‘Idumea’ (Mark iii. 8; Ptolemy, “ Geography, “ v.16). ” 3 But the tide turned in favor of the Edomite faction when Julius Caesar made Antipater, an Edomite, Procurator of J udea in 47 B.C. When Antipater was killed four years later his son Herod gained power but was rejected by the Judahites. Herod shrewdly gained the support of Rome. With a Roman army at his heels he returned to Palestine, and after a six - month siege he capt ured Jerusalem, and became king of Judea in 37 B.c. 1 John D. Davis, A Dictionary of the Bible, (1934) p.332. 2 Encyclopaedia Judaica, Vol. 6, (1971) p. 378. The New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia (1977) p. 589, reiterates the same account. 3 The Jewis h Encyclopedia, Vol. V, (1904), p.41."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 Who is Esau - Edom? Herod was a shrewd and unscrupulous tyrant, and was despised by the Judahites because he was an Idumean and not one of their own stock. Herod hated the people of Judah and one of his first ac ts was to execute forty - five of the leaders of the old aristocracy to eliminate any rivalry for leadership. Having secured the kingship, Herod next destroyed the priestly line of Hyrcanus, the last being Antigonus, who taunted Herod with his Idumean origin , and asserted that the kingdom should fall “ on one of the royal family.,,4 Finally he murdered Aristobulus, the last of the Aaronic high priests. Herod then sought to affiliate himself with the high priesthood through marrying Mariamne, Aristobulus ’ siste r and the daughter of a high priest. Herod even rebuilt the Temple as it was in ruins from repeated sieges, part of which Herod was responsible for by his attack upon the city. The Temple of God became in a sense Herod ’ s temple. We thus find that in the years just before the time of Christ, Judea was controlled by an Edomite faction, who usurped the Judahite name, land and heritage. Under Hyrcanus, the Edomites were forced to be part of Judean culture; but under Herod the Herodian faction had control over the Judean ’ s culture and way of life. Confounding the matter is the fact that some Judahites had intermixed with Edomite, Canaanite and other alien stock at the time they returned from the Babylonian captivity (Ezra 9:1, 2; Neh. 13:3, 23 - 25). These mixedb lood people were also hostile toward the Judean Israelites. The land was not the Kingdom of Judah, but the nation of the Jews (Judeans). Historically the Edomites became known as “ Jews, ” a term derived from “ Judea, ” which was derived from the name “ Judah , ” being the royal line of Israel, though they were never of Judah or Israel. 4 Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XIV, Chap. 15, Para. 2."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Legacy of Esau - Edom? 9 During Titus ’ siege of Jerusalem (66 - 70 A.D.), “ 20,000 Idumeans appeare d before Jerusalem to fight in behalf of the Zealots who were besieged in the Temple. ” s About 97,000 inhabitants of Judea were taken captive, and an unknown number had fled either before or during the siege. This is the last mention of the Edomites as a people in history. Yet Bible prophecy indicates that Edom would be an enemy of Israel in latter times. We find that their only connection to a present day people and religion is with the Jews and Judaism. We thus need to trace back the origin of the Jews t o see who they are and how they fit into the puzzle of who is Esau - Edom. The Origins of the Jews The Jews of today fall within two main types - the Sephardic Jew and the Ashkenazi Jew. The Sephardim are also know as “ Spanish Jews ” and constitute about 5% of the Jews in the world. The Ashkenazim are the “ East European Jews ” which were found in Poland, Russia, Germany, and Western Asia. This group of Jews make up 90% of the so - called “ Jews ” in the world. Many reference and historical sources have unequivoc ally identified that the bulk of the Ashkenazi Jews were derived from a people known as Khazars (or Chazars in some texts). The original Jewish Encyclopedia of 1905, revealed that the main stock of the Jews came from this Asiatic people known as Chazars or Khazars: CHAZARS: A People of Turkish origin whose life and history are interwoven with the very beginnings of the history of the Jews of Russia .... Historical evidence points to the region of the Ura ls as the home of the Chazars.6 5 The Jewish Ency clopedia , Vol. V, (1904), p.41. 6 The Jewish Encyclopedia , Vol. IV, (1905), p. 1."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 Who is Esau - Edom?   Map Showing the Distribution of Religions in Europe in the Tenth Century, A.D. Indicating the Extent of the Jews as C hazars. From: The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. IV (1905) p. 2. The Khazars were a nomadic people who had no traces of Hebraic culture. They had been following a pagan and sex - oriented religion until they had officially embraced Judaism in 740 A.D., while r ejecting Christianity ’ and Mohammedism. The Jewish author and historian, Arthur Koestler, also concludes that the majority of east European Jews - and hence of world Jewry - is of Khazar and not of Semitic origin. In the beginning of his book he states: “ ... t he large majority of surviving Jews in the world is of Eastern European --- and thus perhaps mainly of Khazar -- origin. If so, this would mean that their ancestors came not from the Jordan but from the Volga, not from Canaan, but from the Caucasus; ... and th at genetically they are more closely related to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ” 7 7 Arthur Koestler, The Thirteenth Tribe, Random House, 1967, p. 17."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" The Legacy of Esau - Edom? 11 Koestler then de votes the remainder of his 255 page book to prove this premise. For instance, a record of a letter by a Khazar King shows that he traced his people to Noah ’s son . J apheth, not Shem, and to “ Japheth ’ s grandson, Togarma, the ancestor of all Turkish tr ibe s .”8 The Khazar government was destroyed by the Slavs of Russia in 1016 A.D. Around 1200 A.D., the land was invaded by the hordes of Genghis Kahn. These two events caused large numbers of Khazars to migrate to Poland and western Russia forming the cradle of Western Jewry. “ There is an abundance of ancient place names in the Ukraine and Poland, which derive from ‘ Khazar ’ or ‘ Zhid ’ (Jew). ” 9 As the Khazars left their homeland of Khazaria and migrated north and west, they lost their name and became known as J ews. Their Yiddish language and alphabet is not that of the Israelites (Phoenician - Greek style), but an amalgamation of Aramaic, medieval German, Slovak and Russian dialects. The best historical evidence therefore, shows that the Jews are not descended d irectly from the Israelites of the Bible but derive much of their ancestry from the Khazars and other people of Turkish - Asiatic blood. The Khazars are also of Edomite stock and both stocks make up the present day Jews, as the historian H. G. Wells states, “ ... the ldumeans (Edomites) were ... made Jews, .. anda Turkish people (Khazars) were mainly Jews in South Russia .... The main part of Jewry never was in Judea and had never come out of Judea, ,10 According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, the original stock of the Khazars came from the land of Edom: 8 Koestler, op. cit., p.72. 9 Ibid., p. 145. 10 H.G.

Hasdai ibn Shaprut, who was foreign minister to Abd al - Rahm an, Sultan of Cordova, in his letter to King Joseph of the Chazars (about 960), ... speaks of the tradition according to which the Chazars once dwelt near the Seir Mountains The “ Seir Mountains ” are none other than the original land of Esau - Edom - ” Thus dwe lt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom ” (Genesis 36:8). Seir was a mountain range south of the Dead Sea and was also known as the “ land of Edom ” (Gen. 36:21). The Seir mountains were the home of the Edomites for nearly a millennium.12 Thus, it should be no su rprise that migrants from that land would recall the name of their original homeland. If the Khazars did originally “ dwell near the Seir Mountains ” then the Khazars, and thus world Jewry, are racially of Edomite stock. But how and when did Edomites get t o Khazaria? There is evidence that in the 6th century B.c., some of the Edomites fled their homeland of Seir and migrated north: “ After the fall of Jerusalem, in 586 B.C., the Edomites began to press northward (Ezek. 36:5). ” 13 The extent and ultimate des tination of this northward trek is not found in history but it is likely that it brought some Edomites to the region of Khazaria. The Edomites were also cast out of Palestine and dispersed in different directions in 70 A.D., when the Romans sacked Jerusale m. Many thousands of these people are known to have migrated northward to Asia Minor and around the Black Sea region.14 11 The Jewish Encyclopedia , Vol. IV, (1905) p.3. 12 “ The Edomites arrived in Edom or Seir at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 13th century B.C. ” Ency.

The .I cws of today are such a people. In fact the Jews themselves tlssert they are mongrels because of: “ .. . the original mixed ancestry of the Jews and their subsequent history of intermixture with every people among whom they have live d and continue to live ... ,,15 The anthropologist, Prof. Carleton Coon, has also demonstrated the admixture of the different Jewish types with other races. He explains that while the ‘ Jews ’ cannot be classed as a ‘ race ’ pe r se, they are an ethnic group. “ ... the Jews form an ethnic group; that like all ethnic groups they have their own racial elements distributed in their own p roportions; like all or most ethnic groups they have their “ look, ” a part of their cultural heritage that both preserves and expresses their cultural solidarity ... they have developed a special racial sub - type and a special pattern of fa cial and bodily ex pression.,,16 When we talk of the racial mixtures that brought about the Jews of today, we must highlight the events surrounding the Babylonian captivity of Judah. The remainder of the Judah nation, which included some of the tribes of Benjamin, Levi, and Simeon, was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. But at the same time Edom was also put under Babylonian rule causing some of the Edomites to be brought to Babylon (Jer. 27:2 - 7). When Persia overthrew Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree (538 B.c.) allowing the Judahites to return to their land and rebuild the temple (Ezra 1:1 - 5). However, only about 50,000 returned to Palestine (Ezra 2:64 - 65). Some of them had apparent ly departed to their kinsmen in 15 Ashley Montagu, Man ’ s Most Dangerous Myth , (1974) p.375. 16 Carleton S.

However, many of the Judahites and Benjamites preferred to remain in Babylonia becoming a part of the indigenous pop ulation. Those remaining had intermarried with the Babylonians and Edomites that were in the land and adopted their religion and law - the Babylonian Talmud - which became the foundation for Judaism. These then became the Babylonian Jews - ” Then many of the peo ple of the land became Jews ” (Esther 8:17). Although they are called “ Jews, ” a term which is derived from the word “ Judah, ” these people are not true Judahites but became a mixed or hybridized people, consisting of Edomites, Hittites, Canaanites, Judahit es, Babylonians, Ishmaelites, Huns, Khazars, etc. When they migrated to other lands throughout the centuries, they retained their “ Jew ” or Judahite identity but brought with them the religion of Babylon. The Jews bear the features of the races Esau int ermixed with. Because of the Jews ’ mixed ancestry, history is sketchy as to their origins from Japheth, Esau, or other people in the Bible. However, identification of these persons or tribes can also be ascertained by the characteristics, prophecies, etc ., revealed about them in the Bible. Since Esau - Edom is one of the more predominate figures in the Bible we will endeavor to ascertain his identification and place in historical and current events by these means. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"All The World ’ s A Stage 1 5 --- -- 2 ----- ALL THE WORLD ’ S A STAGE World Events & Problems There is a great deal of confusion as to the nature of world events. There are mysterious political changes, sudden international conflicts, wars, peace talks, financial upheavals and disasters, government corruption and oppression, problems with churches and schools, a change in moral values, and talk of a new world order. Much of what has happened, and much of what is happening in the world is being misconstrued and misunderstood by ministers a nd politicians, statesmen and writers, teachers and historians and all for the same reason. This book is intended to shed some light on why most are in ignorance about such things which are or have occurred in the world. In order to help us understand cer tain historical and current events in the world , • let us reflect back on what the great English playwright William Shakespeare once stated, that “ All the world ’ s a stage, and the men an d women in it merely players.” This statement is based on an obvious observation, that certain people and nations appear to be acting out a prescribed role in history, as though it were planned in a play. It is as though some persons or races or nations were assigned a character role and are destined to follow this role ass igned to them while on the earth."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 Who is Esau - Edom? The Script The statement by Shakespeare also has a divine significance to it and a definite Scriptural basis, as much of what has happened in the world has been acted out in accordance to God ’ s word and His plan for the world. It is not by accident that certain things happen the way they do or that certain people act the way they do. The plans of God and the providence of God revealed in the Bible are at work in the world. Thus, the Bible is act ually much like a script for a play. It is a writing or type of manuscript from God about certain people and events. It should be noted that the word ‘ scripture ’ means “ anything written. ” Webster says it comes from the Latin word scribo - meaning to write. The word script comes from the same Latin word and means the same thing. The word ‘ scripture ’ as used in the New Testament is the Greek word graphe (Strong ’ s # 1124), and is derived from the word grapho (#1125), which means: “ to wr ite, or describe by writi ng.,,1 Thus, in Scripture God is describing things, through his messengers, by writing. The Bible then, is much like a script for a play. It describes and contains in its writing those things essential to any production or play to be acted out on stage. T he Bible, being like a script, contains the following attributes of a script: -- It has a story or stories to tell. -- It has an author, which is God. -- It tells of and describes certain actors or characters and their role in the story. The characters in this Script (Bible) are individuals, nations or peoples. Some have short roles, others long and continuing roles. 1 Strong ’ s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Legacy of Esau - Edom? 1 7 -- It describes certain scenes or events that have or will or are currently transpiring on stage. -- The stage is, as Shakespeare stated, the world or the earth. This is where everything takes place, or where all acts and scenes are performed. -- It has a theme or themes which the stories and events revol ve around. So the Bible is God ’ s Script or writing of what is to transpire in the world and identifies the characters involved. The confusion and misunderstanding so many are having with what is going on in the world today is that they don ’ t know who the main characters are or their roles in the script. For instance, imagine yourself watching a play on stage and one character who you believe to be a servant is actually a nobleman. And the actor who appears to be the hero is playing the role of a thief or v illain. One character enters on stage and you don ’ t know what role he is following and are unable to identify him as one o f the characters in the script. You can see how all the events transpiring on stage right before your eyes make no sense, and any att empt to interpret what is happening and what the play is about could only lead to erroneous conclusions. Even with the script in front of you the story still would be misconstrued if unable to ident ify the characters in the play. This same situation exist s with many events in the history of the world and how they relate to the Bible. God had chosen certain characters or people to act out certain roles and be part of certain events in the world. Without knowing who these characters are, not only are the eve nts that take place in the world confusing and misconstrued, but it will close much of the Bible to true understanding. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 Who is Esau - Edom? It is critical we understand who the characters are and t heir proper role in the Script. To help clear up t he confusion we will attempt to identify one of the main characters in God ’ s Script - that being Esau or Esau - Edom. We can identify who is Esau - Edom by reading in the Script (Bible) what was written about him, what he was to be doing on stage (earth), what his role was to be (predestination), and what characteristics and attributes were assigned to this actor (prophecy) by the author (God). We then need to compare all this to historical and current events and see if any of the persons or nations involved fi t the role of Esau - Edom or possess any of his attributes. Just like when we see a creature who has a flattened scaly tail, who cuts down trees with its teeth, has thick brownish fur, prodigiously builds dams, has aquatic habits, and is warm - blooded we can identified it as a beaver. God had assigned these roles and characteristics to the beaver and they are permanent marks of its identification. In like manner, the Script of God reveals certain roles and characteristics surrounding Esau - Edom by which w e can identify this people. From the foregoing chapter, we have one good clue as to who may occupy the character of Esau - Edom, that being the Jewish people. The following material will help to verify this. If we know that one of God ’ s actors, such as Esau - Edom, is to perform a certain act or possess a certain characteristic, then when we see someone doing the act or expressing the characteristic, we have identified the actor on stage or in the world. No student of history or modern affairs can appreciate the si gnificance of world events without the knowledge of who is Esau - Edom and their connection with Jewry."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Characteristics of Esau - Edom 1 9 ----- 3 ----- THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ESAU - EDOM As with any script the Bible reveals certain traits, attribute s and characteristics of the various actors or characters it talks about. We can thus find in the Bible some attributes and characteristics of Esau - Edom, which will help identify who this actor was in history and perhaps in the world today. There is much e vidence showing that the seed of Esau may safely b e identified with modern Jewry. Edom ’ s Symbolic Name The first revealing attribute associated with Esau - Edom in Scripture is that of a color association with his name. Esau - Edom is symbolically associated with the color red. Esau was actually born with this attribute, as is describ ed in the account of his birth: And the first [Esau] came out red , all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.1 Here we find that Esau had the physical attribu te of being red and hairy, which is contrasted with Jacob ’ s appearance who “ was a plain man ” (Gen. 25:27). The red color of Esau was to be a sign that he would later sell his birthright to Jacob for some red pottage. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pra y thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: there fore was his name called Edom.2 1 Genesis 25:25 2 Genesis 25:30"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 Who is Esau - Edom? The word ‘ Edom ’ actually means “ red, ” 3 just as the name Esau signifies red. This character thus represent s the color red. When we look at the meaning and symbology associated with the color red in both Scripture and secular history we have a better understanding of the nature and identity of Esau - Edom, and who he is to be identified with. Here are some illust rations: • Red is representative of blood and bloodshed (2 Kings 3:22; Isa. 1:15 ). • Scarlet or red is symbolic of sin in general (Isa. 1:18). • The red horse of the Book of Revelation signifies war and the ability to cause wars (Rev. 6:4). Esau was to be war - like and live by the sword (Gen. 27:40). • The anti - Christian, satanic system which ruled Rome was identified as a red dragon (Rev. 12:3). Jews are the most antichristian people on the face of the earth. • The great beast of Mystery Babylon which wa s to spread abominations and death to the whole earth is scarlet or red in color. And the woman on the beast controlling it is dressed in scarlet (Rev. 17:3 - 4). Jews are the major promoters of the Babylonian religion called Judaism. • The banking industry , which is a part of red Babylon ’ s economic control over Christendom, is led by the Jewish banking family of Rothschild, which means “ red shield.

This hatred by God towards Esau is an attribute that the human heart cannot accept or embrace, and therefore many will try to explain it away. Thus scores of theologians have avoided this truth of Scripture or have whitewashed it into something more appealing to human nature. God not only hates Esau - Edom and is against these people, but refers to them as “ the people of my curse ” (Isa. 34:5). This curse is not just on Esau but also his “ seed ” and his “ brethren. ” But I have made E sau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he is no more.9 Among Esau ’ s brethren were the Amalekites which were descended from one of Esau ’ s grandso ns (Gen. 36:4, 12). It was these Edomite kinsmen whom God had sworn “ war against from generation to generation ” (Exod. 17:16). God ’ s hatred of Edom is not a temporary thing but is perpetual. The doctrine that God loves everyone does not stand up in light of what the Bible has to say regarding God ’ s merciless position towards the race of people called Edom.10 Although the churches have tried to alter God ’ s true nature, we find that throughout the Bible God ’ s position tow ards Esau - Edom does not change: 9 J eremiah 49:10. 10 The God of the Bible says “ I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I w ill have compassion ” (Rom. 9:15).

Their way of life was to be a consequence of their inborn characteristics. The Bible des cribes Esau as being “ a cun ning hunter, a man of the field ” (Gen. 25 :27). This reveals the nomadic c haracteristics of Esau as opposed to the more domest icated a nd home - settled nature of Jacob who would be “ dwelling i n tents ” or in houses and communities (G en. 25:2 7). Fenton says Jacob would be “ a stayer in the tent, ” thus I ndicating he would not live a wandering nomadic life but have a permanent home or land. But a hunter ’ s life is one of uncertainty and hardship always wandering to and fro, never having a settled existence. Like the legendary “ Wandering Jew ” the Edomites are cursed to be continually roaming the earth without end. The Jew has been a wanderer and a nomad nearly all of his existence. The greatest extent of a Jewish nation was the Khazar king dom. Arthur Koestler, speaking of the Khazars, says that they were a “ nomadic people, ” and that comp ared to other nomadic empires, “ it occupies an intermediary position in size and degree of civilization. ” 15 Esau ’ s dwelling was to be “ far away from the fe rtility of the earth ” (Gen. 27:39 - N.A.S.V, Moffatt Trans., et al.). Like the Jew, Esau never had a home in a rich and fertile land. The Edomites original nation, Mount Seir, was a rocky and calcareous country, and God la ter made it even more desolate.

In fact, any attempt by Edom to build up its nation or cities would fail: Whereas Edom says, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places ; Thus says the Lord of hosts, They shall b uil d, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and The people aga inst whom the LORD hath indignation for ever. 18 17 Ezekiel 35:2, 3, 4, 9 18 Malachi 1:4 The Wande rin g Jew, as portrayed by the Jew Nahum Zemach in the drama “ T he Eternal Jew ” in the Hebrew Theater, Moscow, 1922.

The Jews, however, are a parasitic people, who roam the civilized world seeking a hos t nation they can subsist on and prosper at the expense of others while contributing nothing. To quote the Jew Samuel Roth: Our major vice of old, as of today, is parasitism. We are a people of vultures living on the labor and the good natur e of the rest of the world....

Their inclination is towards occupations of a more parasitic nature, such as lawyers and bankers. The genius of the Jew is to live off people; not off land, nor off the production of commodities from raw material, but off people. Let other people till the soil; the Jew, if he can, will live off the tiller. Let other people toil at trades and manufacturers; the Jew will exploit the fruits of their work. That is his peculiar genius. 20 Due to this inherent characteristic of the Jew, there is no such thing as a Jewish civilization or even a Jewish nation. Wherever Jews exist in a large concentration, that area becomes run down and desolate like a ghetto. In fact, the word ‘ ghetto ’ is synonymous with the Jews: ghetto, section of a city in which Jews lived. In the early Middle Ages their segregation in separate streets or localities was voluntary .... The reason general ly given for compulsory ghettos was that the faith of Christians would be weakened by the presence of Jews. 21 Regardless of the living conditions that existed in a ghetto, when the Jews inhabited them they never got better but only worse.

The signs of their peculiar characteristic of desolation is readily seen: The Jewis h idea has a tremendous infiltrating force and a serious degenerative power.

Nothing more accurately describes the characteristics of the Jews and the effect they have had on other peoples in the past two thousand years. They continually do ungodly works producing no good fruit. Some of the bad figs of Judah remained in the city of Jerusalem after the captivity by Nebuchadnezar (2 Kings 25:22). These post - captivity inhabitants of Jerusalem wer e joined by Hittites, Egyptians, Edomites, etc. When the good fig people of Judah, Benjamin and Levi returned to the land, many fell under the influenced of the bad figs. Edom ’ s poisonous sap, infused into the rebuilt nation of Judah, made it sterile for ever, so that it bore no fruit or figs. These people are thus represented in the drama of the barren fig tree which Jesus cursed saying: “ Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever ” (Matt. 21:19). Thus this fig tree, like the “ Jews ” it represents, wa s to be forever fruitless. Jesus had referred to these bad figs and their distinguishing characteristics on several occasions.

This land is significant from an historical and bib lical perspective since it is the “ land of the Bible ” and was the ancient site where Israel once lived. But what is its significance today? There are many references to the ancient “ high places ” in the Old Testament. The “ high places ” were sites of preem inence in the land such as centers of worship, places of sacrifice, offerings and prayer, and sanctuary sites (1 Sam. 9:12 - 14; 1 Chron. 16:39; 1 Kings 3:2 - 4; Isa. 16:12; Lev. 26:30,31; Amos 7:9). Jerusalem was a “ high place ” (Micah 1:5) as was Gibeon (1 Ch ron. 21:29). These high places in Palestine were thus the center of attention and the most important areas of the land. While these places were the center of attention during biblical times, the events surrounding the Jewish occupation of Palestine has a pparently led many to believe they are still relevant today as in the days of old. How does the Jewish occupation of Palestine help in the identification of Esau - Edom? Let ’ s reflect upon the biblical maxim that what is popular among men is not representa tive of the ways of God (Isaiah 55:8). The common or popular doctrine among men is that the Jews are Israelites, and as such they must return to Palestine to fulfill Bible prophecy. This erroneous concept has become known as “ Zionism, ” which has developed into a political movement for the benefit of the Jew. Although the term "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Ancient High Places 33 “ Zionism ” is derived from the biblical word “ Zion, ” we must distinguish between what the Bible says about Zion from I he popular concept known as political Zionism. The Bible and Zion Zion, or mount Zion, was the highest of several hills on which Jerusalem was built, and thus represents the greatness a nd majesty of Jerusalem. Zion was originally a Jebusite s tronghold which David had captured and wa s thus called the “ city of David ” (2 Sam. 5:7; 1 Chron. 11:5). It was here at mount Zion that David brought the Ark of God (2 Sam. 6:12 - 18). Zion was the seat of David ’ s rule, it was where his house or palace was erected and where the Tabernacle was first set up. Zion thus became a sacred site and regarded by God as “ my holy hill of Zion ” (Psa. 2:6), and called it “ Zion, my holy mountain ” (Joel 3:17). The gates of Zion were loved by God more than all others in Israel (Psa. 87:2), and it is the place where God dwells (Psa. 9:11; 68:16; 132:13; Joel 3:17,21). Zion was thus the highest and most sacred of the “ ancient high places. ” Prophetic Zion - - Much is spoken of Zion within the area of prophecy. The term Zion is frequently used as the title for Jerusalem a s a whole in its quality as a holy city (Isa. 8:18; 10:24; 30:19; Psa. 48:2, 11 - 12). In Isaiah 52:1, Zion is used in a prophetic sense and is compared to the “ new Jerusalem ” of Revelation 21 :2, 27, as the “ beautiful ” city in which the unclean and ungodly a re not allowed to enter. It is in the land of this prophetic Zion or Jerusalem which God has promised to gather together His people Israel. “ I will take you [Israel) one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion ” l 1 Jeremiah 3:14"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 Who is Esau - Edom? Location of Zion - The Zion or Jerusalem of prophecy was also to be in captivity (Isa. 52:2), it was to be in pain and trouble and thus needing to be “ delivered ” or “ redeemed from the hands of its enemies ” (Micah 4:9 - 10). This Zion is thus not some heavenly abode or spiritual city. It is to be a physical place on earth. An indication of where this gathering of the Israel people would be was revealed in a prophetic pr omise to David, where God said: “ Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more. ” 2 Note that this planting of Israel is something God “ will ” do, not has done. To help identify where this place of regathering would be, we need to ask , where was David when these words were spoken to him? He was sitting in mount Zion of old Jerusalem! Thus God was not referring to that geographical area as the land where He would plant Israel. God said He was going to plant Israel in another place, and was not going to bring them back to the ancient high places in Palestine, for once they were planted in this new pl ace they were to “ move no more. ” That there would be a new Zion is indicated by the phrase “ daughter of Zion ” (Isa. 1:8; Isa. 62:11; JeI. 4:3 1; Lam. 1:6; Mic. 4:8, 10; Zeph 3:14; Zech. 2:10, 9:9). This was to be the successor of the old Zion and therefore was not the old city of Jerusalem . Based upon the biblical identification of the white European people as being God ’ s true and literal Isra el people, the nation of America has often been recognized as this Zion of prophecy or the new Jerusalem. The biblical proofs are overwhelmingly in favor of America and not Palestine as this Zion where Israel is to be placed or gathered. The following are some of these proofs: 2 2 Samuel 7:10 and 1 Chronicles 17:9, see also Isa. 49:20."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Ancient High Places 35 • The land Israel was to be gathered into is described as a “ wilderness ” or an undeveloped land, but with their arrival “ it shall bloss om abundantly, ” as God gives it “ vineyards ” or abundance (Isa. 35:1 - 2; Hos. 2:14 - 15). Palestine was never a wilderness and it never blossomed abundantly. God was to make Zion ’ s “ wilderness like Eden ” (Isa. 51:3). This is exactly what happened in America wh ich had attained great material blessings and the highest living standards. • Zion was to be a land from sea to sea (Zech. 9:10; Psa. 72:8).

Ameri ca is the only nation that was ever legally established as a Christian nation. • Israel ’ s restoration was to take place in a land “ afar, ” or “ very far off, ” where they would “ Look upon Zion ” (Isa. 33:13 - 20; Jer . 30:10). Since this was spoken in Palestine it could not include Palestine . • Zion was to be bountiful in produce and resources, as indicated by its “ wheat, ” “ oil, ” “ flocks, ” “ herds, ” “ corn ” and a land “ as a watered garden ” (JeI. 31:12; Joel 2:15 - 19, 23 - 26). This is a good prophetic description o f America, while Palestine is rather barren in such resources. • The New Jerusalem was to “ be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein ” (Zech. 2:4). Old Palestine is full of walled cities. • The New Jerusalem was to be a very large land, as indicated by the need for an angel to measure it, with its length arid width being 12,000 furlongs (Zech. 2:1 - 2; Rev. 21:15 - 16). This could hardly be referring to little Palestine.

The modern ter m Zionism first appeared at the end of the 19th century, denoting the movement whose goal was the return of the Jewish people to Erez Israel [Palestine]. It was coined by Nathan Birnbaum [a Jew] in his journal Selbstemanzipation (April 1, 1890).3 The ter m ‘ Zionism ’ as used by Birnbaum was intended to express a political orientation toward Palestine, as he spoke of a “ national - political Zionist party. ” This concept was different from the prevailing philanthropic approach. Before this time it was thought pr actical that the Jews, being a scattered and integrated people, should have a homeland of their own, and humanitarian pleas were made in this regard. It was at this time that some theologians started supporting the idea as being a fulfillment of Bible prop hecy.

Thus saith the Lord God; Because the enemy [Idumea] hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession.

If Palestine was destined to be possessed by Edom, then the Jews must be Edom, and through their Zionist plans are fulfilli ng prophecy about Edom, not about Israel. The Zionist Jews have hidden their Edomite identity and true role in Palestine by claiming they are Israel returning to Zion. However, the prophecies concerning Zion and New Jerusalem had already been fulfilled i n America even before the word “ Zionism ” was coined by the Jews in 1890.

God “ forsook the tabernacle o f Shiloh ” (Psa. 78:60). With the Babylonian captivity of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple of Solomon in 586 B. C ., God had fo rsaken the old city of Jerusalem and will never rebuild His temple there. I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city (Jerusalem] a curse to all the nations of the earth. 25 Jeremiah was nearly put to death for giving this revelation of God against Jerusalem. Christ also said Jerusalem was to be left desolate (Matt. 23:37 - 39). God has thus abandoned the ancient high places in old Palestine. When Israel inhabited the land it wa s described as “ a land flowing with milk and honey ” (Exod. 3 :8, 17; Lev. 2 0:24). Ancient history identifies this land as being rich and fertile and as part of “ the fertile crescent. ” Look at it today. It is a wasteland, barren and desert - like.

In the play Julius Caesar there was a conflict between Caesar and his conspirators - Brutus and Cassius. In the story of Cinderella, we find a conflict between the title character and her wicked step - mother. Without this conflict and opposition the entire plot becomes pointless, as it gives life and meaning to the events and actions of the characters. Some manner of conflict or struggle is actually expected, just as they exist in nature, in our lives, in history, and in stories, usually in the form of the age - old conflict between good and evil. Today even the casual observer to the events that are transpiring in the world can perceive the existence of a conflict or struggle between ideologies, philosophies, laws, religion, governments, etc., which produce the trouble, misfortunes and adversity in the world. However, it is not apparent to most who the actors or individuals are at the forefront of this conflict in the world, or why the conflicts and adversity exist. God has written a Script for the world which identifies the two main characters who would be involved in an age - long struggle or conflict - that being Esau and Jacob. This is a constant theme throughout the Script. So let ’ s look at the Script and see what it has to say about them.

And she went to inquire of the LORD. 23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the el der shall serve the younger.1 Here we find that this conflicting and antagonistic relationship between these two characters, Jacob and Esau, was ordained by God even before their birth. Rebekah was barren and it was God who had allowed her to conceive, fo rming Esau and Jacob in the womb along with their unique and differing characteristics. God purposely made these two characters different and contrary to one another. The contrasting differences between Esau and Jacob were represented by their struggle o r conflict in their mother ’ s womb. This was to set the stage for generations of conflict and antagonism between Esau and Jacob who were regarded by God as two different nations or racial groups (some translations say, “ two rival races ” ). They thus were to be separate peoples, each with their own separate character roles and destinies - “ two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels. ” Their struggle also represents the struggle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world.

This conflict and struggle was a characteristic that was to exist between the descendants of Esau and Jacob - that is to say, a permanent and continuing conflict between “ two nations ” or races of people. This then brings the matter within the scope of International Law , and our conflicts today lie within this international sphere. So strong is this them e that it becomes a principle itself. Throughout the Bible the nations of Edom and Israel were in conflict with one another. The struggle between Esau and Jacob in the womb was thus a sign of what was to .. come in the world on an international level. It was to set the stage for a continued conflict between the ideologies, laws, philosophies, governments, religion, and status of the descendants of these two characters. The Jew vs. The Christian The evidences of the God - ordained conflict and struggle bet ween Esau and Jacob can be followed down through history to the present times. World conflicts, wars, persecutions, and social struggles are a result of two different systems generated by the two different peoples (nations) descended from Esau and Jacob. While there are differences among any two races or nations, among no other two has such an antagonistic and conflicting relationship existed as between the Jews and the white Christian people. Throughout history these two peoples have been at odds with on e another. Their manner of law, government, religion, and ideologies are diametrically opposite to one another.

Hysteria and neurasthenia appear to be most frequent. Some physicians of large experience among the Jews have even gone so far as to state that most of them are neurasthenic and hysterical.13 Dr. Alexander Pilez , world famous psychiatrist from Vienna, states in his outstanding work, Wiener Klinische Rundschau , page 888: “ Cases where acute psychoses lend to idiocy and lunacy are of particular frequency with the Jews. ” By contrast, there are no hereditary diseases which exist exclusively within the white race, and the Negro race has only one - Sickle Cell Anemia. As a highly mixed and mongrelized people the Jews would be more prone to diseases than pure races. The same is true with hybridized plants and animals. This woul d include diseases of the mind. “ Idiocy and imb ecility are found comparatively more often among Jews than among non - Jews ... The Mongolian type of idiocy is also very frequently observed among Jews ... Among the Jews the proportion of insane has been observed to be very large ... Jews are more liable t o the acute psychoses of early age than are Gentiles.,,14 The Jewish Encvclopedia also states the causes of these mental disorders in Jews is due to “ the neurotic taint of the race, ” “ a racial characteristic, ” and “ consanguineous marriages. ” This high pro portion of insanity, idiocy, imbecility and lunacy in Jews helps to explain why the Talmud is a collection of imbecilic ramblings of insane minds.

The Jews and white race are clearly two different characters in God ’ s Script acting out the different roles of Esau and Jacob. They are two manner of people, spi ritually, morally, mentally, and biologically; causing natural conflicts between them which are not “ reconcilable. ” Esau ’ s Hatred of Jacob The conflicting and antagonistic relationship between Esau and Jacob was magnified and intensified when Esau “ sold his birthright to Jacob ” for a mere bowl of pottage (Gen. 25:33). Jacob then had the legal right to receive the blessings of the inheritance which he received from Isaac by pretending he was Esau. When Esau realized what had happened and that Jacob now po ssessed the blessings that could have been his, “ Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing ” 15 This hatred was now to be an attribute and earmark of the character Esau - Edom. Throughout the rest of the Script this attribute does not change or subside. It is clearly revealed by Scripture that Esau - Edom would be a perpetual adversary of Jacob - Israel, as it is written: “ The children of Esdu hated the sons of Jacob, and the hatred and enmity were very strong between them all the days, unto this day ” (Jasher 58:28). Thus the descendants of Esau would hate and despise the entire race descended from Jacob. Esau ’ s hatred o f Jacob was exhibited when “ Edo m refused to give Israel passage through his border ” (Num. 20:21 ). During the eighth century B.C ., the prophet A mos distinctly rebukes Edom for her cruelty and anger towards Israel: Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all p ity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever.16 15 Genesis 27:41"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"World Conflict and Adversity 59 Some 200 years later, t he prophet Ezekiel also offers c ondemnation against Edom or ‘ mount Seir ’ (the Edomites), because of their perpetual hatred for the children of Israel: Because thou [mount Seir] has had a perpetual hatred , and has shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end.17 Mount Seir, representing the nation or race of Esau - Edom, or the Edomites, has had a perpetual hatred for the children of Israel down through history. All throughout the Bible the Edomites had shown their hatred and opposition of God ’ s chosen peop le Israel. This was a characteristic of these pe ople which they would not lose. Hatred by Edom ’ s Descendants Nowhere in Scripture is such hatred and animosity to be found as that which Esau - Edom had for Jacob - Israel. The question is, where in history can you find this manner of hatred of one group of people by another. The parallel is clearly revealed in the hatred which the Jews have for the white Christian people. The most obvious evidence of the “ perpetual hatred ” Jews have towards the white Christian people is found in their own Talmud. In this work of hatred and perversion, the Jewish rabbis and sages throughout the centuries have expressed the Jewish attribute of hate towards white Christians.18 The following are some excerpts from the Talmud which demonstrate Jewish hatred of Christians: 16 Amos 1:11 17 Ezekiel 35:5 18 Some of the terms used in the Talmud and other Jewish writings for Christians are: goy, goyim (meaning cattle), gentile, min, minim, minuth, heathen, Cuthean, Akum, idolaters, No khri, and Notsrim."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 Who is Esau - Edom? • It is allowed to cheat a gentile and take usury of him (Baba Mezia 61a, Abhodah Zarah 54a). • The goyim [Christians] are regarded as unclean (Scha bbath 145b, Abhodah Zarah 22b). • It is not allowed to rob a brother Jew, but to rob a gentile is allowed ( Baba Mezia 61a; Sanhedrin 57a). • The goyim are not like men but are as animals (Kerithuth 6b). The seed of a goy is worth the same as that of a beast (Kethuboth 3b; Baba Mecia 114,6). • A Jew must not ent er the ho me of a Christian (Gittin 62a). • The goyim are not to be cured or helped when sick, even for money (Abo dah Zarah 27b; lore Dea 158,1). • It is permitted to deceive a goy (Babha Kama 113b). Jews must try to dec eive Christians (Zohar I,160a). • A Jew may lie and perjure himself to condemn a Christian (Babha Kama 113a - 113b). • A Jew shall not do injury to other Jews, but the law does not prohibit injury to a goy (Mishna Sanhedryn 57). • Those who do good to the Christian ... will not rise from t he dead (Zohar 1,25b). • All the festivals of the followers of Jesus are forbidden, and we must conduct ourselves towards them as we would towards idola ters (Abodah Zarah 2a, 78c). • Do not save a goy in danger of death (HilkkothAkum, XX,I). • When a Je w and a goy come to court, you must absolve the Jew and take his side as far as possible according to Jewish law. If, however, the Jew can be absolved according to gentile law, absolve him (Babha Kama 113a). • A Jew may keep anything he finds belonging to the Akum [Christian], to return it is a sin (Choschem Ham 266,1). The Talmud clearly represents an underlying Jewish object of hatred towards Christians. It teaches Jews to be against the “ goyim ” in every aspect of life, while working to destroy the Chri stians ’ religion and undermining their culture and society. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"World Conflict and Adversity 61 This hatred of Christians, as taught by the ancient rabbis, has continued to succeeding generations and is prevalent in the words and feelings of Jews to this day. Elie Wiesel , the Nobel Prize winning Jewish author and world famous “ holocaust survivor, ” promotes hatred of white people by Jews. In one of his books he stated: “ Every Jew, somewhere in his being, should set apart a zone of hate - healthy, vi rile hate - for what the German personifies and what persists in the German. To do otherwise would be a betrayal of the dead. ,,19 It is indeed interesting that the same enduring hate Edom had for Jacob, the Jews have towards Christians. It is also ironic t hat Jews, who have all this hate in them for Christians, have gone to great lengths to convince the world that they are completely innocent of such an attribute, and it is the Christian who hates the Jew. Edom ’ s Hatred of Jesus Christ The prophecies of C hrist ’ s birth were well known to the people at that time. He was to be the King over all the earth (Zech. 14:9; Dan. 7:13), the Messiah (Dan. 9:25), the redeemer of Israel (Isa. 59:20; 62:11), and would be of the House of David (JeI. 23:5). The Script also reveals that Christ had enemies from the moment of His birth: Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews [Judean s]? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

Why was this Herod “ troubled ” about the birth and arrival of the Messiah, Jesus Christ? First we find that Herod was not of the same racial lineage as Christ: “ Antipater, an Idumean by birth, was made by Caesar procurator of all Judea; and his son , commonly called Herod the Great, was, at the time of Christ ’ s birth, kin g of Judea, including Idumea. ” 20 Herod, lik e his father Antipater, was an “ Idumean ” or Edomite by birth. Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews , also esteems Herod as an “ Idumean ” ( Book. XIV, Chap. XV, Sec. 2, p.438 ). Herod had talked in “ secret ” to the wise men telling them to “ diligently search for the young child, ” and when they found him to come back and tell him so he “ may come and worship him also ” (Matt. 2:7 - 8). This was act ually a ruse so that Herod could kill Christ. When the wise men found Christ they were “ warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod , (Matt. 2:12). Thus they did not return to Herod with the information of Christ ’ s location, which made Herod the Edomite furious: Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had dil igently inquired of the wise men.21 Herod the Edomite had such a hatred for Christ and what he represented, that he had ordered a mass execution to make sure Jesus would be killed. Had not “ the angel of the Lord ” instructed Joseph to flee to Egypt with J esus, Herod would have s urely succeeded in killing him. Other enemies of Christ included the Pharisees, who were promoting and following the religion of Babylon which 20 The Popular & Critical Bible Encyclopedia , vol. ii, p. 852 (1908). 21 Matthew 2:1 6"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"World Conflict and Adversity 63 d e v e loped into the Talmud - the basis of Judaism.22 Thus, th e Rabbis and Jewish Talmud have picked up where Herod an d the Pharisees left off in their ons laught of hatred against Jesus Christ - the Redeemer of I srael. In the Talmud, Jesus is referred to as a sorcerer, idolater, seducer, blasphemer and a fool. It says he committed bestiality, sexual pe rversion, and performed mag ic. It assigns four deaths for J esus -- - stoning, burning, decapitation and strangulation. The Jews ’ assault against Christ and Christianity is historic, as admitted by the Jew Bernard Lazare: The Jew .. .is not content merely to destroy Christianity , but he preaches the gospel of Judaism; he not only assails the Catholic or the Protestant faith, but he incites to unbelief , and then imposes on those whose faith he has undermined his own conception of the world, of morality and of life. He is engaged in his historic mission, the annihilati on of the religion of Christ. 23 Like Herod, the Jew has an h ereditary hatred for Christ and Christianity, and this is c learly expressed in the Talmud a nd other Jewish works. Despite this fact, the organized c hurch world cannot or will not acknowledge that the decline of their Christian nation is proportional to the number and influence of the Jews allowed to exist in it. Anti - Semi t ism The term “ anti - Semitism ” has been used by the Jews to counter and conceal God ’ s natural order and plan in the world - -- an order which has assigned to the Jew the role of aggressor, h ater, destroyer, seducer, invader, and corrupter. By simply calling one ‘ anti - Semitic ’ the Jews attempt to put 22 The Jews admit that “ the Pharisees and the Rabbis ” were the same kind of “ teachers. ” Rabbi A.

In other words, it is those Arabs or those Palestinians, or the Germans tha t are the haters and aggressors, when in fact it is the Jew. Writing in The American Hebrew , Jesse H. Holmes stated: It can hardly be an accident that antagonism directed against the Jews is to be found pretty much everywhere in the world where Jews and no n - Jews are associated. And as the Jews are the common element of the s ituation it would seem probable ... that the cause will be found in them rather than in the widely varying group s which feel this antagonism.24 The result of this name - calling tactic is to focus the attention on the effect of the conflict, and not at its cause. The cause is always some obnoxious trait of the Jew that precipitates conflict and action against the Jew . The Jews then say that it is “ anti - Semitism ” or unwarrante d “ J ew - hatred. ” Yet the hatred or action against the Jew is a natural response. Writ ing under the chapter title of “ Jew Hatred as a Natural Instinct , ” Samuel Roth states: Anti - semitism [Jew - hatred] is so instinctive that it may quite simply be called one of the primal instincts of mankind, one of the important instincts by which the race helps to preserve itself against total destruction. I cannot emphasize the matter too strongly. Anti - semitism is not, as Jews have tried to make the world believe, an active prejudice. It is a deeply hidden instinct with which every man is born. He remains unconscious of it, as of all other instincts of self preservation, until something happens to awaken it. Just as when something flies in the direction of your eyes, the eyelids close i nstantly and of their own accord. So swiftly and surely is the instinct of anti - semitism awakened in man . . . . There is not a single instance when the Jews have not ful ly deserved the bitter fruit of the fury of their persecutors.2 24 As quoted in, The International Jew , The Dearborn Publishing Co., 1920, Vol. IV, p. 222. 25 Samuel Roth, Jews Must Live , (1934) p. 64."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"World Conflict and Adversity 6 5 The Jew, like Esau, has revolted against God ’ s order, and all are justified who do act against the Jew in this regard: “ Thus it would seem as if the grievance of the antisemite were well founded; the Jewish spirit is essentially a revolutionary spirit, and consciously or otherwise, the Jew is a revolutionist. ” 26 What we actually have in the worl d is Esau, who is the hater and aggressor, trying to conceal from the world his identity and innate attributes. If Esau ’ s true identity and t raits become publicly known, he would once again be powerless in the world. The Jews have inherited these attribute s of Esau and frantically try to silence anyone who would reveal them. The anti - Semitic charge, along with the “ hate laws, ” is a tool the Jew uses in defense of his offensive, hostile, revolutionary and anti - Christian nature. If it can be insinuated that one charged with anti - Semitism is the hater and aggressor, an emotional response of the masses can be directed against that individual, forcing him into either silence or loss of status in society, business or politics. Ever since the Jew s invented the l ibel charge of “ anti - Semitism ” in the 1880 ’ s,27 it has been built up with Jewish money, organizations, propaganda, and lies (e.g., the Holocaust), so that now the word is like snake venom which paralyzes one ’ s nervous system .

The end result is that those who f ear being labeled “ anti - Semitic ” will never be effective in exposing the root of the problems in the land. No such fear existed in Jesus Christ who boldly spoke against the Talmudic Pharisees face - to - face in public gatherings. He specifically pointed out t heir char acteristics, stating they were “ hypocrites, ” “ a generation of vipers, ” “ full of dead men ’ s bones, and of all uncleanness, ” “ blind guides, ” “ a wicked and adultero us generation, ” “ full of iniquity, ” “ serpents, ” “ murderers, ” and “ of their father the devil. ” Because of Christ ’ s exposure of the traits and ways of these Talmudic Jews, they could not easily continue in their ungodly practices.

Edom ’ s ro le in the Script calls out for this hatred to be acted out in the world. They cannot and wi ll not deviate from their role. Most see what is happening in the world but can offer no logical reason as to why there would exist this continual conflict, strugg le and hatred between the Jew and those of the white race.

The Hebrew word used here is “ ruwd ” (Strong ’ s No. 7300) and means to ramble or tramp about, be free, disconsolate, - -- have the d ominion, be lord, mourn, rule.6 This verse is thus saying that there will come a time when Esau will be unhappy with the yoke of Jacob about him and will ramble and tramp about until he gains the position of rule or dominion.

With two peoples that are so opposite in character as Jacob (the white race) and Esau (the Jews), one must predominate over the other. They can ne ver have mutual agreement or equal status. If the laws, religion, government and morals that are characteristic of Jacob are followed in the land, then those of Esau are rejected. Esau will, by the nature of his character, be under the subjection of Jacob. And so it was with the Jews in much of European and American history. The Jews, because of their contrasting customs and religion were under specific regulations in white Christian nations. As one history boo k illustrates: Their [the Jews ’ ] religion set them apart from the rest of the population of the country.... The whole of ordinary life was conducted on the supposition that men were members of the same religious body. The Jews did not fit into this framework and so had to live a life apart. They were allowed to live only in certain wards of the larger towns, which were known as “ Jewries. ” They were required also to wear a special dress or a badge of yellow cloth on the breast. They were considered to be living in the country not by common right but by special consent of the king and under his protection. They were subject, therefore, not to the common law but to special regulations made for them by the king or his officers.7 Such was the case regarding the status of the Jew in much of Europe where th ey were subject to the rule of the white race. In early America Jews could not vote, hold public office, be a witness in court, and were socially regarded as a subordinate class of persons.

Our debauched society is evidence to this as Henry Ford stated: It is true that there is a distinct “ Jewish idea ” in busin ess and professional life which has eaten away the traditional principles of honor on which Anglo - Saxon life was erected. Every Jew know s that, every non - Jew knows it. ...

The Jews have long been adept at the primary means for putting other people under economic bondage via ba nking, money lending and usury. The use an d control of usury - -- the loaning of money at interest - -- is a powerful tool for gaining financial dom inion over others. Not only is “ the borrower servant to the lender ” (Prov. 22:7), because of the debt he owes, but he must also pay more than what he borrow ed. By making one ’ s ability to pay off a debt more difficult, the lender can take possession of property put up as security. The Jewish Talmud allows the use of usury by recognizing severa l different modes of obtaining “ increase ” or interest from money l oaned.10 The Bible however prohibits any and all increase, interest, o r gain when there is a loan of “ money, food or any thing ” (Deut. 23:19; Lev. 25:37). The Jews follow not the Bible but the Talmud as their code to A drawing from the Sachsenspiegel, 1220 A.D., depicts a Jew (left) lending money to a German farmer, while taking his horse as security. Much of Christian property fell into the hands of the Jewish moneylenders when borrowers were unable to pay off the loan along with the usury. 10 See: The Jewish Encyclopedia , (1905) Vol. XII, p. 389.

The word Jew became synonymo us with moneylender and usurer. The real key to the Jews ’ economic rule over nations, and the making of usury and credit more effective, is their International Banking Dynasty. This scheme began in England when the Jews, led by Rabbi Manasseh ben Israel, were al lowed to return to that nation in 1657, by conspiring with Oliver Cromwell. 12 With their foot in the door, the international Jews approached William of Orange and promised to help place him on the throne of England, in exchange for helping them secure a ch arter to establish a Bank of England. A Jew named Jacob Henriques was instrumental in this endeavor. William and Mary accepted the crown in 1689, but to justify the bank charter, wars between France and England were now instigated: The constant wars whic h followed William ’ s accession had compelled the king to borrow large sums from the London 11 Samuel Roth, Jews Must Live , (1934) p.123. 12 The Jews were expelled from England in 1290, by King Edward I.

The second result was the organization of a company for the management of this colos sal debt - the Bank of England.13 The Jewish merchants secured t he bank charter in 1694. From that moment on Esau - Edom had financial dominion over all of Britain. As directors of the Bank they could regulate the gold standard, consolidate the national debt, and even impose direct taxation on the people as a means to s ecure loans.

James Madison stated that democracies were a very poor form of government and had always been “ spectacles of turbulence and contention, ” and were “ incompatible with personal security or the rights of property. ” 21 Democracies operate by “ mobocracy ” or mob rule.

They were carried into Babylon and were brought back to be condemned and rejected by Christ.

This is why there is no difference between the Pharisees, who were adamant foll owers of the Tradition of the Elders , which became the Babylonian Talmud , and the Jews of today.16 Edom ’ s Motive to Kill Israel Just as with any villain or murderer in a play or story, there is a motive or reason why Esau - Edom has been trying to kill J acob - Israel all these years. When we look at the scenes and events in the Script, we will find some underlying motives why the Edomite Jews want to kill and destr oy the Christian Israel people: 15 Matthew 23:31, 35 16 “ The apogee of Ph ari sa ism is the T almud of Babylonia, ...

Esau wants the dominion and the blessings back, and his envy and anger for Jacob possessing them in his stead had motivated Esau to destroy Jacob. Now Edom must destroy and kill Israel for it is the only way to get the r evenge for Esau. • Jacob - Israel ’ s birthright and blessings include a status of dominion in the earth with God as their head. This dominion conflicts with the Edomite Jews ’ plan of one - world dominion. If Esau cannot have dominion according to God ’ s plan, he will have it according to his plan. The two dominions cannot co - exist. If all Israelites can be killed, then God ’ s plan for Israel to have dominion in the earth under Him cannot be fulfilled. • If Esau could have killed Jacob as he originally planned (Gen. 27:41), then as the only surviving heir Esau would have regained the birthright. Similarly, If Esau would have died when he still had the birthright, the birthright would have fallen unto Jacob as the next oldest or only surviving son of Isaac. Becau se of this law of inheritance, the Edomites in the world today believe that if they can kill off every Israelite, they can regain the birthright and its blessings as the only surviving heir. • The Edomites, who are composed of Esau mixed with Canaanite p eople, also contain a significant intermixture of the Judahites from Judea and the Babylonian captivity. There are also Israelites who married into the Edomites. These offspring from the Adamic race had a right to the birthright but now as mongrels can nev er again claim that heritage and thus lament over their hopeless fate. These descendants are now a part of Edom and out of anguish and envy they desire to kill their pure - blooded brethren. Esau - Edom may have other motives to kill off God ’ s people Israel but none are truly well - founded on the law.

Esau ’ s motives for killing Jacob are all part of a plot in God ’ s Script. This is why we often see aggressive ’ and harmful actions being staged against the white race -- - the possessors of the birthright . It now becomes clear that the birthright plays a central role in understanding many of the conflicts, wars, adversities and problems in the world. When Esau he ard that Isaac had given Jacob the blessings of the birthright, “ he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry ” (Gen. 27:34). This is exactly what the Jews do when they hear someone say they are not Israel, which means they do not have the birthrig ht. They cry out bitterly against them with wails of “ anti - Semitism . ” Meanwhile, these Edomites seek ways to kill t he real heir to the birthright. Many throughout history have recognized this peculiar characteristic of the Jews to destroy Christians but could never supply an adequate explanation as to why. Without understanding who the characters on stage are and how they relate to the birthright, the play being acted out in the earth becomes qui te confusing to most observers. Edom ’ s Treachery Against Is rael Edom ’ s desire for revenge against Jacob was revealed by Edom ’ s desire to see Jerusalem destroyed when Israel possessed it, as revealed by the writer of Psalms: Remember, O LO RD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof. 17 The word ‘ raze ’ means “ to tear down completely; level to the ground; demolish. ” 18 When Jacob - Israel was at its 17 Psalms 137:7 18 Webster ’ s New World Dictionary , Collins & World Pub.

This philosophy was revealed in the Jew Adam Weishaupt , whose basic “ Illuminati ” creed was, “ Destroy civilization; whatever is, is wrong. ” Thi s concept paved the way for Illuminati Jews to organize the bloody and destructive French Revolution. In the Bible the Edomites, who were fewer in number than Israel, had not the ability or might to take out their revenge against Israel and Judah until they were weakened by a civil war between them (734 B.C.). Judah had suffered the loss of 120,000 men in one day (2 Chron. 28:6). Another 200,000 of Judah ’ s inhabitants were taken captive by Israel along with much of its goods as a spoil (28:8). The Edomit es took advantage of Judah ’ s weakened co ndition and in their vengeance “ had come and attacked Judah, and carried away captives ” (2 Chron. 28:17). Thus, when Judah was torn by the ravages of civil war, it was Edom who had rushed in and ransacked the land an d took the inhabitants into captivity. The ways and characteristics of the actor Esau - Edom do not change, and thus this treachery against God ’ s people can and did reoccur again in another act and another scene of the Script. The scene was America , the t ime was the 1860 ’ s, the act was the American Civil War. Here was a war not only planned and instigated by Jews, such as the Rothschilds, but both sides were financed by Jewish banks. When the Southern states laid devastated in the aftermath of the war, the Jewish - Marxist plan of reconstruction was established to further destroy the white rule and culture. The South was put under military government and whites were deprived of their rights, their Constitutions, and their property. Entire plantations were destroyed, burned and pillaged to deny the white Southerners their inheritance.

Another episode of Edom ’ s treachery and revenge occurred when Judah was undergoing its fina l siege from Babylon. After the enemy armies had captured Jerusalem in 586 B. C ., Edom had treacherously participated in its destruction. Rather than render aid when the enemy was upon God ’ s people, Edom, out of revenge, invaded Jerusalem and took part in t he plunder of the stricken city. This violence of Edom upon Judah was condemned by God: 10 For thy [Esau ’ s] violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. 11 In the day that you stood on the other side, i n the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou was one of them. 12 But you should not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger ; neither should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress. 13 You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, yo u should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; 14 Neither should you have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither should thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.19 19 Obadiah 1:10 - 14"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"10 2 Who is Esau - Edom?

Ed o m ’ s nature was not to change in its desire to take advantage of all opportunities for the destruction of the white Christian peoples, their culture and civilization. Why? Because of Esau ’ s animosity, jealousy and hatred of Jacob for possess ing the birthright he once had. This mode of treachery of Edom again surfaced during World War II. When Germany had been defeated at the end of the war, and the Allied forces had Suppressed its military and rendered it defenseless, it was the Edomite Jews of the Red Soviet Union that had poured into the nation to rape, plunder, destroy and kill Germans. As with Judah, the Edomite Jews “ shed the blood ” of Germans “ by force of the sword in the time of their calamity . ” This act was a typical Edomite style of revenge upon God ’ s people (Germany).

Over 250,000 men, women and children were slaughtered by orders of Jew controlled Churchill (England) and Roosevelt (America ). The persecution and destruction of white Christian people by Jews is not a recent thing but reaches far back into history. Writing in the April, 1921 issue of the Hebrew Christian Alliance Quarterlv . the Rev. M. Malbert stated: “ I am going to show that real religious persecution is uniquely Jewish... In the time of Justinian, in the sixth century, the Jews massacred Christians in Caesarea and destroyed their churches. When Stephanus, the governor, attempted to defend the Christians, the Jews fell on him and slew him. In 608, the Jews of Antioch fell upon their Christian neighbors and killed them with fire and sword... About 614, the Persians advanced upon Palestine and the Jews, after joining their standard, massacred the Christians and destroyed their churches. Ninety thousand Christians perished in Jerus alem alone. ” 22 Perhaps the greatest act of revenge, treachery and hatred perpetrated by the Jews was their destruction and takeover of the white - ruled and Christian nation of Russia. Here we have a premeditated and cold - blooded plan to destroy the white govern ment and people of this nation. Russia as a nation had been populated and ruled by the “ White Russians ” since about 900 A.D. These hardy settlers, being of Germanic and Scandinavian descent, set about to establish a dynasty rich in art and culture.

With the Red Bolshevik Revolution the Jewish revolutionar ies had destroyed this stable civilization in a few days. The Jews were free to release their ingrained hatred through mass murders of helpless White Russian victims. Christians were dragged from their homes, tortured and killed. Some were chained to the f loor and hot lead poured into their mouths. Many were tied to horses and dragged through the streets of the city. Pregnant Christian women were chained to trees and their babies cut out of their bodies. Russia became like a slaughter house with corpses l ying everywhere. The bloody massacres continued on and off through the decades of the Red rule of the “ Soviet Union . ” The Russian author, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, relat es that some sixty - six million “ real Russians ” have been murdered since the Bolshevik Rev olution at hands of the Yiddish revolutionaries. Before the Revolution, Russia was about 75% white, today the bul k of the population is Asiatic. The Jews took another opportunity to massacre helpless Christians during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930 ’ s. The Jew Rosenberg (Moses Israelsohn) headed murder teams called the “ World Revolutionary Movement Purification Squads. ” Their “ purification ” consisted mainly of massacres of priests, nuns, choirboys, women and children. Madrid officials estimated that one tenth of the population of Spain was murdered by the Communist Jews by 1939. In the fall of 1939, the Communist Jews had plotted the mass murder of Poland ’ s leading class. The Communist Jews had dossiers of all who might lead the Polish people to resist , and who had been exposing the Jewish - Communist threat.

This is a violation of Jewish law, which prohibits “ animals ” from being buried. These millions of Christian refugees lay where they fell during these terrible Red Communist expulsions, and nev er received a Christian burial. One act which has clearly revealed the treachery of the Jews was their unprovoked sneak attack on the American ship U .S.S. Liberty on June 8, 1967. The Jews viciously bombed, napalmed, machine gunned, and torpedoed the ship killing 34 and wounding 171. This was an act of hate.

Abortion & Ritual Murder We need to mention some other acts of revenge that have been perpetrated by Jews to bring about the revengeful death and destruction of the white Christian people. One such act is the practice of abortion, which conforms quite well with t he Jewish ritual of child sacrifice to idols such as Molech. The Talmud recognizes such an atrocity as normal -- - ” giving one ’ s seed to Molech is not idolatry ” "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Edom ’ s Revenge 107 ( Sanhedrin 64a). Molech was a god of the Canaanites and Babylonians, and Babylon is the bedrock of the Jewish Talmud and Jewish tradition. This deity was the center of child sacrifice. The Talmud teaches that the extermination of Christians is a neces sary sacrifice ( Zohar II, 43a). It is not surprising to find that the m ajority of abortion clinics are run by Jews or have Jewish doctors in them. Nor is it surprising that Jews are the promoters of abortion, as a majority of Jews favor the “ right ” of women to have abortions. Worldwide it is estimated that over 35 million whi te children have been sacrificed by the Jewish - instituted and promoted plan of abortion. The Jews have long been pressuring legislatures and courts to “ legalize abortion. ” In America this was achieved by judicial usurpation over the rights of the states when the Jew, Justice Blackmun speaking for the U .S. Supreme Court in 1973, claimed to make abortions “ legal. ” 23 The opinion of Blackmun was based in part on the medical ethics and standards of another Jew, Dr. Edelstein. Abortion has become an overt mea ns of child sacrifice which Jews have instituted under their de facto law. A more covert means of child sacrif ice has been by their infamous “ ritual murders, which Jews have been accused through the ages. ” In this practice “ the blood of the sacrificed gent ile (child) is mixed with flour to make the unleavened bread eaten at Passover. ” 24 (For a history and expose on this subject see “ Jewish Ritual Mur der ” by Arnold S.

Jews have dominated the motion picture industry from its ve ry inception. Movies and TV shows which show interracial marriages in a favorable light are either written , directed or produced by Jews. It was Marxist Jews who were behind the anti - white “ civil rights ” movement in America to breakdown the natural barri er between the white and colored races. It was the Jew Joel Spingarn who had founded and headed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909. After his death his son Arthur headed the NAACP until 1965. The Vice President was anoth er Jew, Rabbi Solomon. In 1965 another Jew, Kevie Kaplan, took over the organization. Two long standing Jewish lawyers for the NAACP were Andrew D. W einberger and Jack Greenberg.28 28 Weinberger and Greenberg had filed briefs of amici curiae in the U .S. Supreme Court, on behalf of the NAACP, to strike down a Virginia statute which prohibited interracial marriages, in the case of Loving v. Virginia , 388 U.S. 1 (1967). Two Jewish lawyers, Benard S.

God had established the white race, as He did with Adam (the first white man), to be separated from other races and to have rule and authority in the earth. It has been the Jews ’ role as Esau - Edom to destr oy God ’ s order of things by getting the white race to ignore the natural barriers of distinction between races. The Jew thus runs to the aid and support of the Negro and colored races to elevate them while lowering the status of the white man. With the leg al, political and social distinctions between races eradicated, whites can be more readily amalgamated into the colored races, as th e Jew Israel Cohen once stated: We must realize that our party ’ s most powerful weapon is racial tension . By propounding int o the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites, we wi ll endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of t he Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.29 It has been a tactic of the Jews to incite the colored races against whites. The Jews promote “ equality ” for blacks and other minorities but deep do wn care nothing about their welfare. Their aim is the equalization of races so that the dominion and sovereignty of the white race will be destroyed. Further, miscegenation will eventually produce one mongrelized race making the Jewish goal of a one - world order possible. As Rabbi Abraham L.

All of this activity and control remains rather concealed from the people due to the Jewish control over the media. As t he Jewish author Alfred Lilenthal had written: The most effective component of Jewish connection is probably that of media control. It is well known that American public opinion molders have long been largely influenced by a handful of powerful newspaper s, including the New York Times , the Washington Post , and the St. Louis Post - Dispatch - - - owned respectively by the Sulzbergers, Meyers, and the pulitzers, (all Jewish families).31 The media is now used to hide the birthright from its heirs. The Adamic Bir thright and the Abrahamic Covenant were a blessing and a promise for the heirs of the Adamic race. They included a promise to be prosperous, rich in material wealth, to be a “ great nation ” and that the heirs would have a right to “ dominion ” in the world. T his blessing was bestowed upon Esau by birthright. But Esau sold that birthright to Jacob and with it all its promises and blessings. It is thus out of jealousy and revenge that Esau desires to see the destruction of Jacob ’ s blessings - -- his culture, civil ization, government, industry and relationship with God. Esau gave up title to the Adamic birthright and is now trying to reclaim it by deceiving the whole world into bel ieving he is the chosen of God. It is a genetic function of the Jew ’ s existence to d o the works of their ancestor, Esau, by destroying the white Adamic race. Over 400 million white people have been wiped off the face of the earth in the last 300 years by Jews. They are used by God to perform in that manner whether they like it or not and whether they know it or not.

Exit Esau - Edom In this final act of God ’’ s Script for the world we find appearing on center stage the same two characters which first made their appearance in Genesis 25 -- - that be ing Esau and Jacob. The end of the script reads just as most would expect and hope - -- with justice and a happy ending. Here we find God ’ s people (Israel) being delivered from the hand of their enemy (Edom ) who ends up being destroyed: For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as you have done, it shall be done unto you; your reward shal l return upon your own head.

In this scene the character Esau - Edom makes his final exit off stage, which means he is forever eliminated from the world scene (see also Isa. 34:5 - 6). The Book of Jubilees says that when Esau would gain dominion over Jacob, Esau w ould “ commit a sin unto death, and all thy seed shall be rooted out from under heaven ” (Chap. 26:35). Here then we have the extermination of an entire race or group of people - the Edomites. Today this is often called “ genocide. ” The Bible actually prophes ies the genocide of Esau - Edom! Knowing this, we must again put ourselves in the role of Esau to understand what is happening today. If your role called for your destruction would you not want to c hange or circumvent that scene? Why is it that the Jew is running around trying to get laws passed, internationally and nationally, to prevent any acts that could be construed as leading to or causing genocide? If your life was on the line w ould you not be doing the same? The Jews have instigated and promoted t he genocide treaty, the genocide convention, genocide laws, and even have invented the very word and meaning of “ genocide. ” In late November, 1944, a book was released titled, Axis Rule 1 Obadiah 1:17, 18"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"116 Who is Esau - Edom? in Occupied Euro pe , authored by a Polish Jew and lawyer by the name of Raphael Lemkin.

Raphael Lemkin ’ s new c rime, and his new word for it, ‘ genocide, ’ achieved dizzying success. Less than a decade after he first fabricated it, enough States represented in the United Nations Organization came to ratify the Convention which incorporated it as a new international crime, and most of them surrounded it with enabling legislation to make it the law of their lands as well. All this was achieved by 1951 (ibid., p. 13). To show the world that this new crime of genocide is a potential threat, the Jews found it necessary to fabricate the monstrous lie of their holocaust story where 6 million of their race were allegedly killed by Nazi Germany during World War II. This worked effectively to play on the sympathy of most people especially when it is presented in a dramatic a nd emotional manner. The Jews have established several groups and organizations to spread their biased propaganda and to monitor acts they believe may threaten their extinction. One such group, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, dedicates its energies to “ Holo caust studies. ” It also tracks down “ Nazi War Criminals ” worldwide so they can be tried and executed through their kangaroo court in Israeli or the U.N.

It is because in Go d ’ s Script for the world the Jews are scheduled to be exterminated, and that impending reality is why they are so paranoid about “ genocide. ” It would seem the Jews are fearful of receiving the retribution they know they deserve.

Jacob as God ’ s Tool of V engeance There is more to this story of Edom ’ s demise revealed in the Script that must be considered, and that is the means by which Edom is destroyed. It is Jacob that God will use to destroy and kill Esau - Edom. In Obadiah ’ s prophecy it says that “ Jacob shall be a fire. ” (Obad 18). This is not a purifying or refining fire but a consuming and destroying fire. This fire will both “ kindle ” and “ devour ” the “ house of Esau ” which is regarded as “ stubble, ” a substance which can be easily burned up and destroye d. Like stubble, Esau ’ s very nature is a catalyst that brings about his own destr uction. It is interesting that the Jews have chosen the word “ holocaust ” meaning the whole of something which is burned . The whole house of Esau is described as being burned up - a true holocaust is about to occur. The Jews cry “ never again ” in reference to the Holocaust story, but that fact is it has not yet happened. This destruction will happen to the Jews and at the hand of Israel, the whit e race, as verified by Ezekiel: T herefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom , and I will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword . And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in Ed o m according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.6 Here is another prophecy involving the destruction of Edom at the hands of Israel. This prophecy, from both Obadiah and Ezekiel, was given at about the time of the Babylonian captivity of Jerusalem (586 B.C.).

This presents the ultimate shock and horror to those of the worldly mind set, for this is the one thing above all things that the world has been conditioned into believing must never happen. Even the slightest infringement or harm of a Jew by a white person brings cries of “ persecution, ” “ anti-Semitism, ” and th e remembr ance of the Jewish “ holocaust. ” This is another case where the worldly perspective is opposite and contrary to what God has planned for Esau in the earth. Esau has deceived and influenced most of the world that this plan of his destruction by Ja cob (the white race) is evil, that it should never occur, and all measures must be take n to assure it never can occur. The story of the Holocaust was invented by Esau (the Jews) to give life and meaning to this worldly perspective of genocide. They try t o say that genocide almost happened! White people (i.e., Germans) almost exterminated the Jews and we must never allow such conditions to ever exist again which could precipitate another holocaust of Jews. This is what the world has been taught and believe s. The Edomite - Canaanite Jews have fabricated the 6 million Jewish holocaust story to direct the world away from their inevitable prophetic fate. They are saying that this portion of God ’ s Script mu st never be acted out on stage. P opular thought and opin ion finds the plans of God in this regard absolutely repugnant, because God does not recognize the right of the Jews to continue to exist. Thus no preacher or theologian would dare speak the truth regarding the Jews or the ways of God.

There is not one verse in the Bible that tells us the inherently wicked Edomite - Canaanite people will be saved . Rather they are to be exterminated. Fifteen times in the book of Psalms alone God says He will destroy the wicked; not once does He say they shall be accepted in His Kingdom. The antichrists of this world are to be destroyed, and Jews are devoted antichr ists as i ndicated by their own “ fruits. ” The idea that God would sanction genocide should not be regarded as something new and unique, for God had commanded Israel to kill off and “ utterly destroy ” the seven other nations or races which were in Canaan (D eut. 7:1 - 2). This would have been a genocide of these seven races had the Israel ites carried out God ’ s command. The Edomites also find a parallel with the “ tares ” in the parable of the tares and the wheat. The tares were planted in the field, or the worl d, along with the wheat and allowed to exist with them until the time of harvest. At harvest “ the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world ” (Matt. 13:40). The tares are revealed as the “ wicked, ” just as some day Ed om shall be called “ the border of wickedness ” (Malachi 1:4). The Jews are running around like chickens with their heads cut off because some of them realize that “ the t ime of harvest ” is approaching. Edom was a cause of Jacob ’ s troubles.

He then “ took the valuable garments of Nimrod ” and fled from his men (Jasher 27:4 - 11). This exhausted Esau, and so when he “ came from the field, and he was faint ” (Gen. 25:29).

When he killed Nimrod and took his garments, Esau assumed another b irthright, that of Nimrod and his Babylonian rule, one which could 7 See Martin Luther ’ s book, The Jews and their Lies. 8 The Jewish Encyclopedia , vol.

The Script of God reveals many interesting parallels between Red Edom and the Red beast system of Babylon. As indicated they both have the color identification of red. There are also similarities between their prophecies and judgments. These need to be examined for t he sake of further identifying who and what Esau - Edom is. The following are some of these parallels: --- Burned and destroyed by fire: In Obadiah 1: 18 Esau is devoured by the flame of Jacob. Babylon will also “ be utterly burned with fire ” (Rev. 18:8). --- Be overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah: Both Ed om (J er. 49:18) and Babylon ( Jer . 50:40) are to end in destruction “ as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah. ” --- Habitations made desolate: Edom shall have its habitations made “ desolate ” by “ the least of th e flock. ” (J er, 49:20). This exact same judgment is given for Babylon (leI. 50:45). --- Dominion over, and war against, Israel: As shown, Edom was to gain dominion over, and afflict Israel. The system of Babylon also is to have dominion over God ’ s people a nd make war against them (Dan. 7:21 - 25; Rev. 12:17; 13:7; 17:6). --- Has a covert reign over the world: The final stage of rule of Babylon is a “ mystery ” (Rev. 17:5). Edom is also exalted very. “ high, ” which involves “ hidden things ” (Obad. 1:3 - 6). --- Isra el to destroy and be delivered from: Both Edom (Obad 1:16 - 18) and Babylon (Rev. 18:4) are what God ’ s people need deliverance from. This deliverance comes by God ’ s people destroying its oppressor (Dan. 7:26 - 27; Rev. 18:6). Who is it today that is promotin g the Babylonian system?

Jeremiah spoke of that period of time as a time of “ travail ” and as the “ time of Jacob ’ s Trouble , ” from which he was promised to be saved and delivered. These are the wo rds of prophecy concerning Israel and Judah : For thus says the LORD: I have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. Ask now and see whether a man does travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

For it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off their neck , and I will tear off their bonds, and strangers shall no longer make them their slaves .9 Here again we see that a yoke will be upon Jacob. The yoke is bondage and servitude to another race which has a dominion over Jac ob. When Esau broke the yoke of Jacob off his neck he was to gain dominion and place a yoke upon Jacob. It is this yoke of Esau which God has promised to someday break off Jacob ’ s neck. God prophesied of Israel that He would “ break the bars of their yoke a nd deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them ” (Ezekiel 34:27).

Every nation that has become a willing partner of the Jewish - controlled United Nations has surrendered its military to its edicts. Every nation that has its monetary system depen dent on a centralized Jewish - controlled bank has surrendered its “ purse ” into the hands of the Jews. The people of those nations have lost their liberty and have the “ yoke ” of Esau - Edom upon them. It will be by a “ miracle ” of God that this yoke will be re m oved and the people delivered. A further revelation of the process and nature of Jacob ’ s final deliverance from his enemy Esau is found in the Apocrypha of the Bible: Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunder of the times [ ages]? or wh en shall be the end of the first age, and the beginning of the age that follows? And he [the Lord] said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob ’ s hand held first [or from the beginning] the heel of Esau.

Everything in Scripture has a meaning or purp ose. The heel represents the end and the hand the beginning of man.

Jewish Talmudism owes its existence today to the indifference with which it is regarded.... The Jew is prejudiced against the Bible, do ing what he can to destroy public honor of the Book . 11 The Christians do not see the Jews as the antichrists they are, but rather as Bible followers and “ God ’ s chosen people. ” This condition will change with Jacob ’ s deliverance: So you will again disti nguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him. 12 It should go without saying that if the white Christian people all knew that the Jew is the wicked one, is not an Israelite, and does not serve God , it would be the end of the Jew, and Christians would be delivered from the Jew ’ s corrupting influence and yoke of bondage.

Edom is thus much like the rich man in Christ ’ s parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19 - 3 1). The yoke and the adversity of the Edomite Jew has been brought upon us (Israel) due to our own actions of transgressions against God. Likewise, when Solomon had severely violated God ’ s “ covenant ” and “ statutes, ” God had “ raised up an adversary to Sol omon, Hadad the Edomite ” (1 Kings 11:6 - 14). The form of remedy or deliverance from this state is outlined in Deuteronomy 30:1 - 4; 2 Chronicles 7:14; and Jeremiah 3:12 - 13. God is not only the author of the Script that is being followed in the earth, but is director and producer, and in fact owns the stage and all characters and props on it. As the Psalmist says, “ The earth is the LORD ’ s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein ” (Psalm 24:1). Yes, all the world is much like a stage, and the stage is now being set for Esau ’ s destruction and Jacob ’ s deliverance.

This material has dealt with one of its main themes - that being the conflict between good and evil, right and wrong, lawful and lawlessness, the ways of God and the ways of man. While this theme is fundamental and can be seen by most in the world, it has not been clear who the ch aracters are involved in the conflict. There is one thing that is unmistakably evident regarding the Bible, and that is it deals with and is about a particular race of people -- - the direct descendants of Adam later called Israel. They are the main charact ers in God ’ s Script. Esau - Edom is a secondary c haracter in this Script. Only when we know and identify the white European people as the Israel people, and the Jews as the Edomites, do things in the world make complete sense. When the roles of Jacob and E sau are identified, we see that everything is happening ex actly as written in the Script. The problem the world has been plagued with is a case of mistaken identity and unknown identity regarding the roles God has assigned to Esau and Jacob. The Edomites do not like the role they have been assigned and fear being found out for who they really are. They thus have been trying to rewrite the Script to keep white Christians from discovering their identity and heritage and that of the Jew. Thus it is believed that Esau (the Jew) is Jacob (God ’ s chosen people), and Jacob (the white race) is just a “ gentile. ” "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 Who is Esau - Edom? No one can deny that the Jews are a most unique and unusual people which stand out in history and current events. That uniq ueness exists in part because of their Edomite heritage. No other people fit the characteristics and follow the role of Esau - Edom so completely as do the Jewish people. The Jews follow the role that their ances tors the Edomites had followed. The Jews, ho wever, also have a lineage with the other individuals and tribes they have intermarried with. This includes Hittites, Canaanites, the descendants of Japheth through Togarmah, Magog, and Ashkenaz, and the descendants of Ham through Canaan, as well as some I sraelites and Judahites that have mixed with t hem through the course of time. While heredity, migrations and racial backgrounds do show who the Jews are and are not, the real test is the “ fruits ” of their words and deeds (Matt. 7:16 - 20). If Christians wo uld only accept this simple test Christ provided us and apply it to the Jews, they would readily see they are not the people which they think they are - -- the Israelites. They are instead the rejected and cursed of Judah, mixed with the cursed line of Esau , along with other peoples, and that cursed lineage compels them to act the way they do. Their fruit identifies who they are and who they are not, just as their odd and unpleasant facial features attest to their hybridity (which is als o a curse placed upon the Jew). Unlike the blessings upon God ’ s chosen people, the curses upon a cursed and rejected people (whether spiritual or physical in nature) prevail regardless of what races they intermix with. We now have 2,000 years of history showing consistent un godly behavior patterns of a cursed people called “ Jews, ” which should be proof enough for anyone to show that they are not the blessed children of God. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Epilogue 129 All of this has indeed added to the confusion over the identity of the mode rn - day Jew. The modern - day Jew faces an identity crisis which even they acknowledge. In a sense the “ Jews ” do have a heritage in the Bible, and yet they do not. As mongrels or hybrids, the Jews do have some biological roots extending back to Abraham and th e Judah people. But as mongrels, they can never possess the birthright or claim true heritage of the original or pure Adamic race. For it is written: A mongrel shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not en ter into the congregation of the LORD.1 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.2 Mixed Adamites, those possessing both Adamic and non - Adamic blood, can no more be a part or heir of the A damic race than one who is entirely of another race. The law will not allow the Jews to inherit the birthright or the kingdom regardless of the fact that they have Adamic blood in them. As mongrels the Jews cannot represent the Adamic line or the Israelite people, and thus cannot rightly be called Israelites , as the Jewish Almanac states: Strictly speaking, it is incorrect to call an ancient Israelite a “ Jew, ” or to call a contemporary Jew an “ Israelite ” or a “ Hebrew. ” 3 A cursed and rejected people, such as the Edomites and some of the Judahites of Christ ’ s time, do not have God within them. As Christ said “ If God were your Father, you would love me ” (John 8:42). Can you think of anyone that hates Christ more than these people kno wn as Jews today? 1 De uteronomy 23:2 2 Nehemiah 13:3 3 Richard Siegel and Carl Rheins, The Jewish Almanac , New York: Bantam Books, Inc., 1980, p. 3."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 Who is Esau - Edom? The Edomites were a mixed and rejected people throughout the entire Bible. The Jew can only claim to be of those lines from Adam that were either rejected by God or who had violated the law through interracial marriages. Conspiracy and Conflict Conspiracies are as “ old as the hills. ” God ’ s people have often been the target of conspiracies (Psa. 83: 3). It should by now be seen why talk of an “ International Jewish Conspiracy ” makes no sense to the general public. They don ’ t see or understand anything of the kind because they do not know the identity of the characters in God ’ s Script - -- the Bible -- - or t heir roles in that Script. Why would Jews, which the entire church world holds up as the apple of God ’ s eye, want to ha rm or destroy white Christians? Through the various organizations, movements, political parties and masonic orders, which Edomite Jews have either established or infiltrated, a definite program has been designed to prevail over or h arm the white Christian people. As heirs of Esau, the Jews are also destined to act according to an assigned role. Thus Jews need not be part of a conspiracy to dominate the world, or to harm or vex Christians, or to destroy their civilization. The Jews, or some of them, are used by God to execute His plans in the earth. Jews follow this role in God ’ s Script and have been doing these things and will continue t o do them whether or not they have any specific plans against God ’ s people. A lion kills to eat because God had assigned such attributes to its ancestors when He created them. Lions cannot help what they are or what they do, they act in such a manner bec ause it is ingrained within their constitution to do so.

They cannot deviate from hating or doing ungodly and destructive things anymore than a lion can refrain from killin g, for it is their way of life. Another factor that exists in the subversive role of the Jews, and why conspiracy theories e xist, lies in the nature of the curses they possess. The very presence of a cursed people can cause nega tive and harmful effects to God ’ s people. For this reason God told Israel not to intermix with any cursed people, such as the Midianites or Canaanites, nor allow them to dwell in their land. Such people would be a “ snare ” and a “ vex ” to Israel due to their cursed nature. This works as a silent conspiracy against God ’ s people, and the Jews have exhibited this trait within Christian circles. A Divine Plan for Evil Nearly all of Christendom is united in the belief that all of the ills and troubles of this world are the result of an invisible, spiritual devil or satan, which is in competition with God for control of this world. We must always remember to mistrust the obvious and that which is popular, for such things are often the opposite of what they appear. The Bible supplies us with scores of illustrations in support of this hypothesis. Many biblical messages reveal that the popular belief and ways of the people are contrary or opposite to the ways o f God. As Jesus Christ stated: “ For that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God ” (Luke 16:15). Likewise, that which is exalted by man, God will make low, and that which is o f low degree, God will exalt.4 There is perhaps nothing that is more highly esteemed and exalted by 4 Luke 1:52 - 53; Luke 10:15; James 1:9 - 10."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 Who is Esau - Edom? the church world than these God - cursed heathen mongrels called ‘ Jews ’ today. The re could be no greater evidence that these Jews are not God ’ s people than the universal belief that they are. Thus the organized church world, which has been in-fluenced by Jewish indoctrination, had to have a scapegoat for certain evil things that happe n. They teach that our adversary is either something spiritual, such as an invisible devil, or is something yet to come, such as the future antichrist. In other words, our foe is something we cannot fight against because it is not physical or not yet physi cally here. The result is that the Jew, our real physical enemy, the one we can fight, or expel out of our land, or kill, is free to assail us at will because the Judaized churches say they are “ God ’ s Chosen People. ” The Jewish author Maurice Samuel once stated, “ there are essentially two peoples as spiritual forces in the world - -- Jews and white Christian people. ” 5 What we see occurring in the world is not a conflict between God and a supernatural devil which Judaized theologians promote. The Jews know th at as long as Christians believe that imaginary spooks, devils or satans are the “ evil forces ” which are to blame for their problems, conflicts, wars, etc., they will never see that it is the Jew who God has assigned as an evil force here and now. The resu lt is that Christians will never lift a finger against the menacing Jew as their Eur opean ancestors had often done. Our adversary is whoeve r God assigns to that role (1 Kings 11:14 - 25), or who He has made with an evil, ungodly disposition.

Yes, the evil, destructive and hostile Edomite Jews were made tha t way by God: I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things (Isaiah 45:7) . Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you (Jeremiah 18:11). Behold, I have cre ated the smith who blows the coals in the fire,... and have created the was ter to destroy. (Isaiah 54:16). The LORD has made all things for himself: yes, even the wicked for th e day of evil. (Proverbs 16:4). Evil, wicked persons are a part of God ’ s plan for this world, persons who would be against His order, His law and His people. No supernatural devil exists in this plan. Rather, the “ evil force, ” which we now so prevalently see, is caused by the negative and ungodly traits of the Edomite Jews degradin g and debauchin g society and all that is good. But could we not preach the word of God to these wicked Edomite - Canaanite Jews converting them to righteousness? No, for God says they are b orn that way and will not turn: The wicked are estranged from the womb; They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. ( Psalm 58:3 - 4 ). These Edomite - Canaanites are born with ungodly traits. God didn ’ t tell Joshua to convert them, He told Joshua to slay them. God promises their destruction not their conversion (Psa. 58:10). Even if raised in a righteous environment the Edomite wil l still be wicked (Isa. 26:10). Thus Esau - Edom and his Canaanite brethren are not an extinct and no longer existing people. They are in the world today, and they are still at their an cient task of defying God and attempting to corrupt and destroy God ’ s true Israel people. They are still in God ’ s Script acting out their role in the world.

APPENDIX The following excerpts are taken from the well researched book entitled, A Short Study of Esau - Edom in Jewry , by Mr. C . F. Parker.1 Pg. 17 - -- “ Articles in the National Message identifying the seed of Esau with modern Jewry hav e caused a certain amount of perplexity to those who have been accustomed to regard the Turk as the progeny of Jacob ’ s twin brother. This latter identification is based upon no historical evidence. Our rendering of ‘ Ottoman ’ is from ‘ Osman ’ (the founder of the Ottoman dynasty), which allows no philological connection with ‘ Teman ’ of Obadiah, who according to Genesis xxxvi, 11, was the grandson of Esau. There is an abundance of evidence showing that the seed of Esau may safely be identified with modern Jewry . ” Pg. 18 - -- “ Throughout the Bible story runs a constant theme of an age - long struggle between Jacob and Esau. So strong is this theme that, in effect, it becomes almost a principle in itself; even before the birth of these twins we read of what is int erpreted as being a pre - natal struggle, eventually continued not only in the lives of the two sons in maturity, but also in their posterity through the ages. ” Pg. 20 --- “ Josephus... records (Ant. III, ii, 1) that the Amalekites (of the seed o f Esau) oc cupied the strong holds of Gobolitis and Petra, and ‘ were the most warlike of the nations that lived thereabouts, ’ stirring up all manner of opposition among the desert tribes against the people of Israel. ” 1 The Covenant Publishing Co., London, 2nd Edit ion, 1949."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Appendix 13 5 Pg. 24 - -- “ ...the Herodians (being Idumeans), who, in prophetic allegory, symbolize the present unregenerate world - order which, first by means of the League of Nations, and now through V.N.O., has aspired to a self - assu med Messianic role, despising the real Messiah. ” Pg. 26 --- “ Since the breaking of their nation, the Jews have continued to absorb proselytes from all races, until now there is no such thing as a representative Jewish type. The ancient monuments which po rtray Hittite profiles confirm the infusion of Esau - Hittite blood into the nation, with other additions, almost to the point of erasing the original Israelitish features. ” Pg. 35 --- “ Central European Jewry may therefore be safely identified not only as the offspring of the broken House of Judah, but also as the literal progeny of the Esau - Edomites who desecrated the later Judahite nation. This is a fact of profound significance and seems to offer an explanation of the many contradictory elements in the h istory of the modern Jewish people. ” Pg. 41 - -- “ The Edomite element may, for all we know, be a minority among the Ashkenazim, among whom we must also ‘ allow for the existence of a proportion, as indicated by anthropological and historical data generally , of people who might claim descent from Judah. Ashkenazic Jewry is thus comprised of three elements of not exactly known proportions: (a) those of Judahite descent; (b) those of Idumean origin; (c) proselytes of other origins. ” Pg. 43 - -- “ Within the mo dern Jewish people are ... an alien element, among which are the Idumean - Hittites, masquerading as the true seed of Abraham and seeking to expel the direct descendants of Jacob. ” "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"136 Who is Esau - Edom?

As an evil power, he has used the evil we have legalized -- - usury -- - to gain control of world finance and to remove Israel - Britain from control of it.
