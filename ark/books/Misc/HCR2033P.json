and 7 Whereas, the Constitution of the United States provides for 8 enumerated powers of the federal government; moreover, the Tenth Amendment 9 specifies such enumerated powers as negative rights of the federal 10 government, while protecting vast unenumerated powers for the state 11 governments, stating, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by 12 the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the 13 States respectively, or to the people\"; and 14 Whereas, Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the United States 15 Constitution empowers state legislatures, including the Legislature of the 16 State of Arizona, to prescribe the \" Times, Places, and Manner\" of 17 conducting elections; and 18 Whereas, the definition of \"manner\" is at the sole discretion of the 19 Legislature; and 20 Whereas, Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the United States 21 Constitution empowers state Legislatures, including the Legislature of the 22 State of Arizona, to direct the manner of appointing electors for 23 President and Vice President of the United States; and 24 Whereas, Article IV, Section 4 of the United States Constitution, 25 known as the \"Guarantee Clause,\" guarantees each state a republican form 26 of government, the foundation of which is self-governance through free and 27 fair elections accurately reflecting the will of the people; and 28 Whereas, the fifteen counties within the State of Arizona conducted 29 an election on November 3, 2020 for federal offices, including selecting 30 electors for President and Vice President of the United States; and 31 Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Arizona has exercised its 32 authority to establish election administration procedures for the state 33 under Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) title 16, commonly known as the 34 Arizona Election Code; and 35 Whereas, title 3, section 2 of the United States Code further 36 empowers state legislatures to appoint electors if the election failed to 37 produce a clear winner of an election due to tampering; and 38 Whereas, the A.R.S. section 16-121.01, subsection B, paragraph 2 39 specifies conditions to be a qualified elector and disqualifying factors 40 from being such, including \"That the registrant has not resided in this 41 state for twenty-nine days next preceding the election or other event for 42 which the registrant's status as properly registered is in question\"; and 43 Whereas, the Arizona Election Code requires that all persons voting 44 in an election must be registered to vote twenty-nine days before an 45 election by law, and voter registration was extended by the federal 46"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HCR 2033 - 2 - judiciary to October 23 in direct conflict with A.R.S. section 16-101, 1 subsection A, paragraph 3, a violation of the separation of powers;

and 5 Whereas, pattern analysis of early v oting ballot return envelopes 6 revealed that of 34,448 such ballot return envelope images there were 7 2-copy, 3-copy and 4-copy duplicates originating from 17,126 unique voters 8 while no duplicates were reported in Maricopa County's canvass report; and 9 Whereas, Maricopa County reported 1,455 ballot envelopes having no 10 signatures, yet they were counted contrary to A.R.S. section 16-547, 11 subsection A, which requires the following: \"I declare the following under 12 penalty of perjury: I am a registered voter in [fill in the county name] 13 county Arizona, I have not voted and will not vote in this election in any 14 other county or state, I understand that knowingly voting more than once 15 in any election is a class 5 felony and I voted the enclosed ballot and 16 signed this affidavit personally unless noted below\";

and 23 Whereas, the requisite chain of custody for twelve Maricopa County 24 early voting ballot transport statements was broken by missing one sealed 25 signature; and 26 Whereas, the requisite chain of custody for fifteen Maricopa County 27 early voting ballot transport statements was broken by missing one 28 received signature; and 29 Whereas, the requisite chain of custody for fifteen Maricopa County 30 early voting ballot transport statements was broken by missing two sealed 31 signatures; and 32 Whereas, election day poll workers and observers testified to 33 observing discrepancies in ballot handling, that ballot chain of custody 34 was breached in case after case, that poll watchers and observers were not 35 allowed to be on site or close enough to observe whether poll workers were 36 following proper identification processes, that poll workers were made to 37 stay seated or in a particular area far away from where voting activity 38 was occurring, that poll workers were reprimanded for asking questions and 39 that poll workers observed bias in voting; and 40 Whereas, some voters were made to vote a provisional ballot while 41 others were instructed to simply retrieve proof of residence, showing 42 improper and biased voting center activity when, in certain circumstances, 43 workers were instructed to call the Elections Department for voter 44 authorization as opposed to following standardized protocols applicable to 45 all voters;

4 batches and trays of ballots by the thousands in one 4-5 hour shift were 5 carried to rooms and offsite where they were not overseen; workers in the 6 ballot processing room were allowed to retain their personal purses and 7 backpacks and were observed rummaging through them, presenting opportunity 8 for ballot tampering; ballots were moved to rooms where there were no 9 independent ballot watchers; signatures on absentee ballots did not match 10 and thousands more in a 4-5 hour period were not verified before being 11 counted or \"run through\" electronic signature adjudication, which alone 12 could comprise hundreds of thousands of ballots in Maricopa County, in 13 which 1.875 million out of 2 million were cast by mail; there was 14 inadequate and improper oversight in which only one independent ballot 15 observer from two different parties was assigned to observe the ballot 16 processing activities of 90 tables at one time and from a distance; and 17 Whereas, election observers witnessed the following: computers and 18 laptops with internet connection capability in the tabulation centers; 19 over-votes for candidate Trump were not counted even when voter intent was 20 clear;

and 29 Whereas, evidence was presented that individuals were permitted to 30 vote in violation of A.R.S. section 16-122, which states, \"No person shall 31 be permitted to vote unless such person's name appears as a qualified 32 elector in both the general county register and in the precinct register 33 or list of the precinct and election districts or proposed election 34 districts in which such person resides, except as provided in sections 35 16-125, 16-135 and 16-584\"; and 36 Whereas, the Arizona Election Code authorizes poll watchers, 37 selected by candidates and political parties, to observe the process of 38 canvassing absentee and mail-in ballots in certain counties in the state, 39 but the watchers were not allowed to meaningfully observe the 40 precanvassing and canvassing activities relating to absentee and mail-in 41 ballots;

and 11 Whereas, the Arizona Legislature has the duty to ensure that no 12 citizen of this State is disenfranchised, to insist that all elections be 13 conducted according to the law and to satisfy the general public that 14 every legal vote is counted accurately; and 15 Whereas, mathematical modeling evidence was presented to the Panel 16 to explain how the slope of tabulation for the presidential candidates 17 could only be explained by a vote count of 130% of one party's registered 18 voters, revealing the violation of \"one person, one vote\"; and 19 Whereas, on November 30, 2020, the Panel was shown evidence that, 20 while tabulation of votes using vote tabulation equipment was intended, 21 through extraordinary means fractional vote calculation occurred, awarding 22 more than one vote to one candidate and less than one vote to another; and 23 Whereas, evidence related to the matching of signature records made 24 by voters predating the election to those found on paper ballot envelopes 25 was provided; and 26 Whereas, evidence was received by the Panel that votes for candidate 27 Trump were intermittently, and in some cases immediately, assigned to 28 candidate Biden, and votes for candidate Trump were not tabulated; and 29 Whereas, the Arizona Senate Forensic Audit revealed key 30 cybersecurity failures of the system necessary for electronic tabulation 31 of votes, including the failure to perform basic operating system patch 32 management and the failure to update antivirus definitions, despite the 33 claim that the system was not configured to access the internet nor 34 capable of accessing the internet, which represents a significant security 35 risk as reported by the Senate's qualified cyber forensics analysis 36 provider;

and 12 Whereas, there is clear evidence of intentional remote overwriting 13 of the security logs by the Elections Management System Administrator 14 (EMSADMIN) Account where on February 11, 2021, 462 log entries were 15 overwritten, on March 3, 2021, 37,686 log entries were overwritten and on 16 April 12, 2021, 330 log entries were overwritten as reported by the 17 Senate's qualified cyber forensics analysis provider, all in direct 18 violation of 52 United States Code section 20701;

and 25 Whereas, Maricopa County records reveal a failure to maintain chain 26 of custody and properly document ballot retrieval and transport, which 27 makes it impossible to verify the origin of the ballots counted in the 28 election under scrutiny; and 29 Whereas, Arizona statutes set out specific requirements for secure 30 ballot retrieval and chain of custody procedures of the transfer of voted 31 ballots from drop boxes and vote centers; and 32 Whereas, Maricopa County officials violated Arizona statutes and do 33 not have the required chain of custody for at least 740,000 ballots;

and 40 Whereas, the Arizona Legislature understood the need for ballot 41 chain of custody and included that requirement in A.R.S. title 16; 42 moreover, the Secretary of State, Governor and Attorney General agreed on 43 the requirements for voted ballots deposited in Early Voting locations in 44 the 2019 Elections Procedure Manual (EPM);

and 4 Whereas, of the 1,895 Early Voting Ballot Transport Statements 5 (EVBTS), eighty percent have defects that violate Arizona statutes; and 6 Whereas, violations of Arizona statutes include documents with no 7 record of the number of ballots retrieved and documents that reveal a 8 failure to assign two couriers for each ballot retrieval; and 9 Whereas, the Maricopa County Recorder, who is responsible for 10 enforcing the chain of custody of all ballots, failed to enforce the 11 counting of ballots and record the number of ballots retrieved from each 12 ballot drop box location. Arizona law was disregarded by the Maricopa 13 County Recorder's Office, specifically the EPM requirement that when the 14 secure ballot container is opened by the County Recorder or officer in 15 charge of elections or designee, the number of ballots inside the 16 container shall be counted and noted on the retrieval form. These 17 violations of Arizona statutes are so egregious and so widespread that 18 they demand referral to the Arizona Attorney General's Office under the 19 Arizona Election Code, which states, \"An officer of an election who 20 knowingly fails or refuses to perform any duty required of him under this 21 chapter is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor unless another classification 22 is specifically prescribed\"; and 23 Whereas, 1,514 EVBTS forms out of a total of 1,895 forms have no 24 ballot counts and 48 out of 1,895 unique EVBTS forms have either one 25 retriever signature where two are required or have no signatures at all; 26 and 27 Whereas, 23,344 voters voted via mail-in ballot even though they 28 show in the Melissa Commercial Database as having moved and no one with 29 the same last name living at the address of record for the voter; 2,382 30 voters voted in person even though they show in the Melissa Commercial 31 Database as having moved out of Maricopa County; 2,081 voters moved out of 32 state during the 29 days before the election and were given a full ballot 33 instead of a presidential-only ballot; and 255,326 early votes show in the 34 VM55 that do not have a corresponding EV33 entry, in total showing that 35 the margin of error far exceeds the margin of victory by candidate Biden; 36 and 37 Whereas, there is additional evidence of similar crimes of 38 compliance and manipulation of votes in Pima County and of \"ballot 39 harvesting\" in violation of A.R.S. section 16-1005 in Yuma County; and 40 Whereas, the State of Arizona's general election results were 41 certified on November 30, 2020 when the Arizona Secretary of State, the 42 Governor of the State and the Attorney General of the State prematurely 43 certified results of the November 3, 2020 election even while a hearing 44 was underway revealing election discrepancies and fraud, herein 45"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"HCR 2033 - 7 - enumerated, knowing that such action would deprive one or both candidates 1 due process in the ongoing litigation regarding presidential electors. 2 Therefore 3 Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, 4 the Senate concurring: 5 1. That the Members of the Legislature recognize that lawful voters 6 expect that election officials and state legislators will do their duty to 7 ensure that lawful votes of the people as cast are honored and not diluted 8 or debased by acts classified by the Arizona Legislature as criminal acts. 9 2. That, in the words of constitutional expert Alexander Hamilton 10 in Federalist 68, \"Nothing was more to be desired than that every 11 practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. 12 These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally 13 have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, 14 but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper 15 ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by 16 raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? But 17 the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort, with the most 18 provident and judicious attention.\" 19 3. That when a state legislature exercises this plenary power to 20 determine the manner in which electors are chosen, that power is governed 21 solely by the federal Constitution, the jurisprudence memorialized in 22 Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 137 (1922) (function of state legislature 23 in carrying out a federal function derived from the United States 24 Constitution \"transcends any limitations sought to be imposed by the 25 people of a State\") and that no state constitution, state law or state 26 court can alter or constrain that grant of power. 27 4. That the appointment of these electors is thus placed absolutely 28 and wholly with the legislatures of the several states, that this power is 29 conferred on the legislatures of the states by the Constitution of the 30 United States and cannot be taken from them or modified by their state 31 constitutions; and that whatever provisions may be made by statute, or by 32 the state constitution, to choose electors by the people, there is no 33 doubt of the right of the legislature to resume the power at any time, for 34 it can neither be taken away nor abdicated, the jurisprudence memorialized 35 in McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 34–35 (1892). 36 5. That the legal doctrine E x Dolo Malo Non Oritur Actio, a right 37 of action cannot arise out of fraud and that \"No court will lend its aid 38 to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. 39 The maxim lies at the foundation of a general rule of public policy, the 40 rule that the courts will not sustain an action which arises out of the 41 moral turpitude of the plaintiff or out of his violation of a general law 42 enacted to carry into effect the public policy of the state or nation.\" 43 Marshall v. Lovell, 19 F.2d 751, 755 (8th Cir. Minn. 1927). 44 6. That substantial irregularities and violations of A.R.S. title 45 16 elections law are specifically classified as criminal behaviors. 46"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"HCR 2033 - 8 - 7. That significant irregularities associated with the illegal 1 practice commonly known as \"ballot harvesting,\" a class 6 felony criminal 2 offense under Arizona law, affected mail-in balloting, precanvassing and 3 canvassing and occurred during the November 3, 2020 election. 4 8. That there was infringement on the Legislature of the State of 5 Arizona's authority pursuant to the United States Constitution under 6 legislative plenary power and the \"Supremacy Clause\" to regulate 7 elections. 8 9. That the selection of presidential electors and other statewide 9 electoral contest results in this State involving federal offices is in 10 dispute. 11 10. That, based on the clear and convincing nature of the evidence 12 cited in this Resolution, there remains an irreconcilable controversy that 13 cannot be resolved with the declaration of a clear winner, and as such is 14 irredeemably compromised. 15 11. That the Office of the President of the United States is in 16 fact the Chief Magistrate of these United States, charged with the duty of 17 care under the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution as such to maintain 18 impartial and fair elections. 19 12. That Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the United States 20 Constitution provides, in relevant part, that \"Each State shall appoint, 21 in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a Number of 22 Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to 23 which the State may be entitled in the Congress.\" (Emphasis added.) The 24 Supreme Court has described the constitutional authority of the state 25 legislatures to determine the manner of choosing electors as \"plenary.\" 26 See McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 35 (1892); see also Bush v. Gore, 27 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000). 28 13. That the Supreme Court of the United States has even noted 29 that, \"whatever provisions may be made by statute, or by the state 30 constitution, to choose electors by the people, there is no doubt of the 31 right of the legislature to resume the power at any time .\" McPherson, 146 32 U.S. at 35 (emphasis added, quoting with approval Sen. R., 1st Sess. 43rd 33 Cong. No. 395); see also Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 104 (\"The State, of 34 course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, 35 can take back the power to appoint electors\"). 36 14. That the Members of the Legislature hereby notify the President 37 of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of 38 Representatives and the Members of Congress from the State of Arizona that 39 it is the justifiable position of the Arizona State Legislature that we 40 set aside the results of the Maricopa, Pima and Yuma County elections as 41 irredeemably compromised and reclaim the 2020 Presidential Electors due to 42 the irredeemably flawed nature of these elections that prevent the 43 declaration of a clear winner of said presidential electors. 44"}]
