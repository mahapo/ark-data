The Illuminati is a subject much more complex than so-called Internet Conspiracy Theory, or a Dan Brown plot. Having said this, some may have found the information contained in the previous books of the Confession of an Illuminati series, not always easy to follow, due to the incredibly difficult nature of esoterica, and Freemasonry. For this reason, I recommend viewing such literary works more as manuals, to consult over and over again, as the information can take along time to fully digest. However, in this work , I hope to clear up a few missing links from my previous books. I introduce new info, as well as unpublished documentation and very rare articles from various authors. In this ongoing battle against ignorance, we can use knowledge as weapons of understanding against the Satanic enemy, often hidden behind the false spirituality of the so-called New Age movement. The same enemy that has the so-called intellectual establishment and academic milieu worldwide 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"under their full control. They force their liberal agenda built on lies and deceit, to help and support the Communist New World Order. Unfortunately, it never ceases to amaze me how many people still joke about the idea of a Global Conspiracy. Have they forgotten the Cold War and the immense problem of Marxism versus Capitalism in Western Society? Well, as I also wrote in Confessions of an Illuminati, Volume II: The Time of Revelation and Tribulation Leading up to 2020 , the general public must comprehend what is really going on behind this veil of illusion, and only then will we understand the years before and after the great changes of 2020, indicated by many in Illuminati circles as the possible turning point towards a wider, and much tighter implementation of the New World Order on a massive scale. There are many who believe this will be the time of disclosure concerning a possible “alien reality,” a truth which will undeniably revolutionize and forever change our society and mankind. In the last few years, a series of videos surfaced on the internet showing what some describe as UFO’s, others as angels and demons, flying over the Temple Mount and the Old City of Jerusalem. Of course, many of these sightings could be a hoax or military objects, but what is really happening behind the scenes in regards to one of the most controversial places on earth is a mystery worth discussing. The Hebrew prophets all proclaimed that in the last days, the exiles of Israel would return to the Promised Land and that later the Temple would be rebuilt. “ Then the nations will know that I the Lord make Israel holy when my sanctuary is among them forever.”(Ezekiel 37:28 ) These phenomenal end-time events are unfolding before our very eyes and The Temple Institute , which is the organization leading the Jewish movement for the construction of its new Jerusalem Temple has already made detailed plans, and provide regular updates concerning various “preparatory” activities. So far, the information that has been disclosed paints a striking picture. Some examples include the “Last Spring,” announced in 2015, which will be the altar for the future Temple when completed, that is identical in size and characteristics to that which existed at the time of Jesus. Then there is the work of the famous architect Shmuel Balzam , who is developing the blueprints for the Temple’s Sanctuary. The best goldsmiths of Israel are also faithfully reproducing copies of the furniture and tools used during that sacred period (shovels, basins, trumpets, crowns, cups, censers, candlesticks, and more). They are preparing clothes and ornaments true to tradition, and in 2013, the “Committee for the Veil” was created with a team of Jewish women who 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"are weaving a veil that will adorn the temple. In recent years, extensive studies have been made by interested parties in the Jewish community to replicate, with extreme accuracy, the sacred rites of their ancestors. Thanks to sophisticated DNA studies, scientists have been also able to trace the male descendants of Aaron. These are the only men said to be able to exercise the priestly office in their religious tradition, as well as to revive the famous Ritual of the Red Heifer ( in Hebrew parah adumah ). This is also known as the Ritual of the Red Cow , where a red cow is brought to the priests as a sacrifice, as according to the Hebrew Bible, and its ashes are to be used for the ritual purification (as prescribed in Chapter 19 of the Book of Numbers ), and deemed suitable for service in the third temple. After centuries and centuries, the Temples re-appearance is considered a sign in anticipation of the next coming of the Messiah. In short, we are closing in on the so-called end times ... and every little detail, if properly interpreted, reveals even more disturbing truths. The so-called Liberals, Socialists, Marxists, Communists, and Progressive idiots, are ruining the planet with their sick and perverse ideologies, born in the secretive world of deviant Masonic Lodges infiltrated by Jesuits, and often sponsored by Labor Zionists and liberal Jews. Labor Zionism or Socialist Zionism is the left-wing of the Zionist movement. It was Karl Marx himself who described them once as “useful idiots,” the very people who carried the Marxist ideals he helped to create. Democrats and similar left-wing affiliations, who were once known universally as liberals, who in recent years, I've heard referred more and more to as “Progressives”, are being used in US politics to express something more radical than social liberalism, that appears, in fact, more like Marxism. A top communist defector Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa , the highest-ranking official to ever have defected from the former Soviet bloc, stated back in 2012, in an article for PJMedia, that any doubt that the Democratic and the Communist parties had secretly joined forces was erased for him in 2009, “when Van Jones, part of a left fringe of declared Communists, became the White House’s green jobs czar. This unprecedented “alliance” between the Democratic Party and the Communist Party, was also reflected earlier in the CPUSA’s endorsement of Barack Obama for president in 2008, and the party’s continued support for Democratic Party policies. So the Communist conspiracy to take over the world secretly continues in their mission to destroy Christianity, but 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"many people, even my own mother, don’t believe they exist. In the meantime, Mondialist’s with a Communist twist continue to dissolve independent sovereign states, abolish private property, prevent the private accumulation of capital by increasing taxes, abolish most civil rights with the excuse of terrorism, support internet censorship to squash all dissent, and to impose of course, a uniform doctrine and code of behavior for all of humanity. This whole mess, ultimately, is the product of the decline of the Western Initiatic System, that I will be discussing in this book, and that we are trying to fight with the Ordo Illuminatorium Universalis. This is the small initiatic Order I currently preside over as Grand Master, that has been interwoven in the past, as some of you may know, with the infamous branch of the P2 lodge in Monte Carlo. However, after a series of meetings that took place between the 12th and 13th of July 2008, the situation changed, and the Order is now based in Italy where an officially recognized political association in 2013 was created, and a traditional Masonic body in 2016 (i.e. the Strict Templar Observance ). The outcome of the meetings that took place in Nice in the summer of 2008 became the event that settled the future course of the main Knights Templar branches in Europe , including the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (O.S.M.T.H.), operating under Count Fernando Pinto de Sousa Fontes , the Priory of Sion at the time in the hands of Gino Sandri, and they also helped the further establishment of the Ordo Illuminatorium Universalis (O.I.U.) , born officially in 1999 within the Masonic Executive Committee (MEC) of the Principality of Monaco. I would also like to write briefly about my upcoming publication in the English language called Invisible Master, my next book with CCC Publishing. This project was actually called, Confessions of an Illuminati Volume 4 , in the Italian language . Of course, the decision made by CCC Publishing and IPG distribution to change the title and possibly market it in a different way from the Italian edition has only changed the outwards aspect of this extremely important book, that I would prefer you consider for your studies as a continuation of my Illuminati Confessions series. In comparison, Volume 5 should be viewed by my readers as an additional essay dedicated to some of the most important topics touched during my exposure, a sort of synthesis with added info of great importance, that I will try to present in an easier way, to possibly satisfy an even wider 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"audience that should understand that we are fighting the most important battle of our time, against a seemingly unstoppable Satanic enemy. The Western Initiatic System discussed in volume 5, which created Freemasonry and the Illuminati, was originally formulated back in Ancient Greece when they blended the Mysteries of Eleusis, Samothrace, Orpheus, Dionysus, and in Ancient Rome and across its empire, the Mithraic and Isiac Traditions. These systems of thought and religion, effectively combined much older mysteries and esoteric traditions, with the rationalism of Philosophy, which constituted the real genius of such traditions, and their subsequent mystery schools. Greek initiates were strongly present in Alexandria, in the last period of Egyptian history known as the Ptolemaic period. They brought with them the Greek Initiatic System of the Mysteries, which was then incorporated by the ancient Egyptian priests into their far more ancient Atlantean traditions, thereby giving a new, coherent structure. This was for most Illuminati groups the real birth of the Hermetic Theurgic tradition (Theurgy means \"divine- working\"). Sumerian and Egyptian magic also found their place in the ancient Greek mysteries and the Western Initiatic Tradition, or Western Initiatic System. So let’s try to understand where the origin of Freemasonry is found in all this, and where Satanism and Black Magic come into the equation, gradually ruining what was considered, and is still considered by many, including the author, a respectable tradition. In order to accomplish our mission, we need to understand if the extended Masonic history told in the Rites of Freemasonry, that goes back hundreds, even thousands of years, is just a sequence of fabricated tales, or is this fraternity truly as ancient as they often claim they are? Did they really begin with the historical builders of the Temple of Solomon? Did they have their roots or influence from Sufi mystics? Did they evolve from the Knights Templar? Or did this fraternity originate from the frequent guilds of Craftmasons that originate in Ancient Rome? There are many myths in this elaborate heritage, although most sensible thinkers and skeptics alike, believe that Freemasonry is only three hundred years old, but on the contrary, it represents something much 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"older. The official contemporary day of the establishment was set in June 1717, when the Grand Lodge of England was supposedly fashioned, even if there are contemporary Masonic historians who are now contesting this supposed truth. In a recent Conference held by Quatuor Coronati Lodge No. 2076 , a Masonic lodge in London dedicated to Masonic research, at Queens College, Cambridge, in England, Andrew Prescott and Susan Mitchell Sommers, proved conclusively that the Grand Lodge of England was not founded in 1717, but in 1721. Profs. Prescott and Sommers discovered detailed minutes of the creation of the GL of England in 1721, at the back of the Lodge of Antiquity minute books. It was a large and well-organized event. John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu was the first Grand Master, not Anthony Sayer (c.1672 – 1741). However, the origin of this enigmatic order is fairly ambiguous and is definitely shrouded in mystery, as is everything connected to the Western Initiatic System and related mystery schools. It is a common error today, to believe at the time of Edith Starr Miller, Lady Queenborough (1887-1933) , author of the controversial Occult Theocrasy , “that the English Grand Lodge is an independent body which was formed in 1717.” Edith Starr Miller who was a British blue blood on par with Princess Diana, might have been stupidly \"anti-Semitic,\" and at times “anti-Masonic,” who erroneously thought that all Freemasons are occultist involved in Luciferian inner circles, but she did correctly explain back in the early 30’s, in regards to the origins of the Premier Grand Lodge of England that: “Logic deduction will show that owing to its formation is the result of Rosicrucian effort, it always has been, and still must be, subject to the direction of its esoteric parent body, i. e. ROSICRUCIANISM or Manichean and Socinian Gnosticism. Childish as may be the claim of English Grand Lodge as to its autonomy and independence, yet it has been most successfully defended by scores of English writers who attacked Masonic Societies and their subversive activities against state and religion. According to the English Grand Lodge was always exempted from such groups.” Edith Starr Miller 1887-1933), was spot on and correct regarding the connection to English Freemasonry with Rosicrucianism, even when she stated: “It is time to put an end to this legend. English Grand Lodge, the body which claims to represent English Freemasonry, is as much the child 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"of Rosicrucianism today as it was in 1717 and has no more power or wish today to rebel against, or deny its parent than it had then.” So, why is it in 2018, English Freemasons continue to hide their secret links to Esoteric Rosicrucianism and powerful groups like the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia , or the more recent Order of the Rose Cross (ORC) . Why are they still hiding their occult roots in favor of a social club kind of approach? Regarding Esoteric Rosicrucianism , Edith Miller tells us that: “This Esoteric body, mainly Cabalistic in its direction, always has been and is in truth international.” Miller also described how Rosicrucianism linked with the birth of the Golden Dawn and later the infamous Ordo Templi Orientis: “Has penetrated every association, society or organization just as did the Illuminati of Bavaria at the Wilhelmsbad convent of 1782. In the particular Gnostic Rosicruciana in Anglia, briefly sketched here, we see internationalism clearly depicted. At one time it was personified in Kenneth Mackenzie who, initiated and illuminized by the German Rosicrucian adepts, was later the connecting link between German, English and French Gnosticism, the latter represented at the time by Eliphas Levi (A. L. Constant). Nearer to our own time, William Wynn Westcott is the connecting link of this international Rosicrucian- gnosticism. Prominent Grand Lodge and Royal Arch Mason, he was also Supreme Magus of Rosicruciana in Anglia and Knight Kadosch etc. His connections with John Yarker, as also with the French hermeticist Papus and with the theosophist, Blavatsky, were of an esoteric kind, but most important of all were his close relations with his brother Rosicrucian MacGregor Mathers and the German Theodore Reuss. For it is, we know, William Wynn Westcott, the respected English Grand Lodge, and Royal Arch Mason, Supreme Magus of Rosicruciana in Anglia who, together with the Cabalist MacGregor Mathers, created the Rosicrucian branch known as the Order of the Golden Dawn. With Theodore Reuss, he was closely associated with the foundation of the Ordo Templi Orientis which from Reuss and Karl Kellner's manuscripts is known to be phallic. How far the reciprocal conferring of degrees in their respective orders between John Yarker, W. W. Wescott, Theodore Reuss, Engel,and Papus is a case of interpenetration remains to be determined. John Yarker was the head of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of the Rite of Swedenborg, etc., Wm. Wynn Westcott, the Supreme Magus of Rosicruciana in Anglia, Theodore Reuss and Engel, heads of the German 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Illuminati and Ordo Templi Orientis, and Papus, head of the Martinists. We are fully aware of the Gnostic practices of these different rites but the student bent on a certain type of research will find interesting and instructive the study of the political activities of the different bodies mentioned.” Shortly after Edith Starr Miller completed her revealing book, Occult Theocrasy, she died suddenly in Paris on January 16th, 1933, at the age of 45. One year earlier she filed for separation from her husband citing cruelty, but she had been in good health. Even the Grand Lodge of Canada records that she died \"under suspicious circumstances\". Miller's sin? Well, she wrote that the Jesuit-Jewish-Masonic-Illuminati-Bolshevik conspiracy theory (and the secret societies that support it), was to empower the super rich by controlling education and the mass media. She felt such aims were Satanic in origin, but she clearly focused too much on the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy so popular in her day with people like her husband, a member of the British Occult Theocracy, Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough, GBE (1861 –1949) , who was not only the treasurer of the League of Nations, but also a member of the British Union of Fascists. Lady Queenborough and her husband were alleged pro-Fascist’s and Edith, in particular, was friendly with Brigadier-General Robert Byron Drury Blakeney (1872–1952). Blakeney was the second president of the British Fascists from 1924 to 1926 and was later active in the Imperial Fascist League, The Britons, the British Union of Fascists, and the Nordic League. However, Edith Miller’s husband, who helped secure the oil monopolies for John D. Rockefeller, might have eventually changed his mind about his wife’s literary endeavors during the making of Occult Theocrasy (that took place between 1921 and 1931) and possibly murdered her. Of course, Miller was wrong in regards to the Jews controlling everything rhetoric, as we know things are much more complex. We need to, in fact, change our limited view to understand what’s really going on. Although in her book, Miller also spoke of the Jesuits, she missed their central role. We need to change our perspective in regards to what Miller was actually trying to tell us in her work and her views in regards to the origins of English Freemasonry and its strong historic links to Esoteric Rosicrucianism. Remember, a commitment to transformation must go 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"along with a change in understanding. Change is the most Universal Law of the Cosmos for the Illuminati. As cosmic beings, we partake in the cosmic Laws and must submit to its naturalness. The more we accept the Laws of the universe, the more we can understand the principal elementaries of Creation. All true and real paths will lead to a constant change towards the better for the truth seeker. There is much fear in the world at the moment. Most fear is based on the fear of change, and we are living in a timeline of great change. Change is the enemy of the profane and the ignorant, but it sets the truth seeker as well as the real Illuminati initiate, apart from the ordinary world. The Illuminati, on the good, or the bad side of the fence, strive to see the world as it really is, and will slowly understand that the world reflects its supreme Law of change within its fold. Who are the Illuminati and what are Secret Societies ? Adam Weishaupt wrote the following: Do you realize sufficiently what it means to rule in a secret society? Not only over the lesser or more important of the populace, but over the best of men, over men of all ranks, nations, and religions, to rule without external force, to unite them indissolubly, to breathe one spirit and soul into them, men distributed over all parts of the world? . . . And finally, do you know what secret societies are? What place do they occupy in the great kingdom of the world’s events? Do you think they are unimportant, transitory appearances? ( Nachtrag von weitern Originalschriften , II, pp. 44, 51.10) The most profound lies hinder us from seeing things as they really are, and instead, we construct Māyā within Māyā of falsity within us. Māyā means \"illusion\" or \"magic\" and has multiple meanings in Indian philosophies depending on the context. In ancient Vedic literature, Māyā literally implies extraordinary power and wisdom. There are many haters of the truth out there, and most of them are brainwashed with liberal-progressive Anti-Christian propaganda. The lies are often sweet and delightful for all the fools who chose to believe them, like those we see every day in the mainstream media. Sooner or later we will turn against the liar, sending him back into the eternal wheel. Just watch Hillary Clinton's daily anger and bitterness after being defeated by Donald J. Trump in 2016, despite all the desperate pleas from her own 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"party to shut up and go away, she still continues her eternal rant, obviously consumed by sourness and bitterness, because she lied to herself and the American public during the electoral campaign, but she will never accept that. Before concluding my introduction, I would like to talk about Dharma and Karma. These concepts are often confused among ordinary people, as well as truth seekers, but they are very important for the Illuminati of the various Mystery Schools. Dharma is the perfect law of the Cosmos and its Creation in Buddhism. We are all born to fulfill some kind of Dharma, the method for completing one’s dharma is through karma. Karma is the ritual actions we perform, viewing existence itself as the major ritual each and every one of us must accomplish every day, to enter into the conclusive state of one’s dharma. By performing wrong karma, you will push yourself from completing and executing the deeds needed for you to be in accordance with your dharma. Dharma is the Cosmic Law and we as cosmic beings, just as the initiates of the various Illuminati Mystery Schools, are subdued by this Law. The treatises (shastras) of Hinduism on dharma known as Dharmaśāstra , place a great emphasis on suddha to accomplish dharma. Suddha means pure. What makes the pure, unpure is connected to lies and the karmic deeds performed in the soil of sin. You can just imagine the impurity reached by the occult elite in their quest for world domination and unlimited power. If we do good deeds, the consequences will be good for us. On the other hand, if we do bad deeds the consequences will be harmful. There is no effect without a cause or cause without effect, so the present state of the elite that dominates the New World Disorder, seems to me, pretty bad. Let’s remember that in the superior world there is a Court of Divine Justice to judge our actions, which we also call Divine Law or Divine Justice. In the pyramids of Egypt, several illustrations of the Court of Divine Justice were found. No matter what belief system you subscribe to in this lifetime, there is always someone above watching and analyzing our good and bad deeds and then applying the final sentence, which is the consequence of our actions. For example, the sentiment that an eternal hell is a place of retribution is the most popular conception of hell for Christians. Theologians call this ideal a divine contrapasso. A contrapasso is a law of Divine retribution and justice, where the punishment matches 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the crime. It is a universal conception that is not confined to Judeo- Christian religions but is also expressed in other religious traditions that have very different worldviews than Christianity, such as the Indian religions with Karma and Dharma, or the Yin and Yang in the ethics of Confucianism. For this reason, we need to reference the Ancient Greek aphorism \" know thyself\", one of the Delphic maxims that were inscribed in the pronaos (forecourt) of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, according to the Greek writer Pausanias. “Know thyself”, has become almost a slogan for all truth seekers in the West, as well as Freemasons, but still, it contains the truth of dharma. You must achieve knowledge about your Self if dharma shall prosper in your life, and refine you into the purest state reachable. As a truth seeker you are already close to this goal, take care to never build your inner knowledge upon lies. Lies will give birth to karma, actions, that take you down alleys that lead you astray from Self, and will destroy your dharma. Imagine this: You are accused of having committed a questionable deed and are confronted with it. The way you act accumulates the results of your karma in the dharmic records. Imagine this: You are obsessed by achieving something or someone, but the only way to achieve it, is to play a game of life that indicates that you cannot be altogether truthful in obtaining this goal. What will your actions be? Your actions will be recorded and remembered by dharma just as the actions of your enemy. It is your actions that bring you nearer or further away from dharma through this incarnation of your being. You are now embarking upon a path of true knowledge and understanding, a seeker of truth, who really wants to learn about the present decline of our Society, and the Western Initiatic System that caused it, without all the lies and the hypocrisy of the many disinfo agents out there confusing our minds daily.  16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Chapter One The secret beliefs and practices of Freemasons & the Illuminati The mission of Volume 5 Manly Palmer Hall (1901 –1990), who was a well-known Canadian born masonic author, astrologer, and mystic, wrote: Freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity - an outer organization concealing an inner Brotherhood of the elect. Before it is possible to intelligently discuss the origin of the craft it is necessary to establish the existence of these two separate yet interdependent orders, the one visible and the other invisible. The visible society is a splendid camaraderie of \"free and accepted\" men enjoined to devote themselves to ethical, educational, fraternal, patriotic, and humanitarian concerns. The invisible society is a secret and most august fraternity whose members are dedicated to the service of a mysterious Arcanum Arcanorum. For thousands of years, Freemasonry existed within the Western Initiatic System, transmitting in secret from one generation to the next, their secret knowledge, just as other secret societies of the Illuminati network have done again and again over the centuries. Some of this knowledge is positive, some of it negative, if not completely evil, as it contributes to the domination of the masses, immersed to this day, in ignorance and bigotry. Several of these early mystery traditions affected the latter-day mystery schools, such as the historical Egyptian esoteric teachings I mentioned earlier, the Persian Mithraic mysteries, and also the Greek mysteries. In all this, we find Hermeticism, Shamanism, Paganism, Druidism, 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Gnosticism, the Kabbalah, and Alchemy, to name a handful of beliefs, to include of course, the more secret side of Christianity, connected to enigmatic groups, such as the Essenes, who were a Jewish sect that many historians link to Jesus and the Gnostics. The latter was revived by the more recent New Age trend. Various Gnostic groups initially sprouted from west to east, all across Europe, the Middle East, and Russia, which later became the land of the Orthodox Church. This made the Gnostics disappear for a long time, before reappearing prominently at the end of the eighteen hundreds in various Illuminati sects, and Rites of Freemasonry. The Ancient Mysteries used by Jesus to perform miracles are for most Masonic Brethren, only possible thanks to this lesser-known branch of Christianity known as the Gnostics, later accused of heresy, who were profusely persecuted, and often executed by mainstream Christians. Some Masons even say the letter “G” featured in their tradition stands for Gnostics , and Gnostic Christian teachings are a subject of extreme secrecy up to this day. In the meantime, the Roman Catholic Church grew and became the dominant religion across the Roman Empire, absorbing any remnants of older pagan religions or cults within their fold. We must also keep in mind, that people lived in profound “darkness” for centuries because only the aristocracy, or the clergy of the Church, could be literate, therefore the majority of people could not read or write. The dark side of the Illuminati network had an easy job in dominating the masses, due to the ignorance of the majority of the world’s population. One particular of the resources powering the Western Initiatic System through the centuries comes from the historic Illuminati households, where we find a secretive team of priestly families who transmitted their ancient teachings, using sectarian tradition. In the meantime, they infiltrated the various avenues of typical daily life, and of course, the religion of every land, or kingdom, they entered. Only lately has this mysterious group been partly exposed, thanks to the Dan Brown frenzy of the first decade of the new millennium, but for most historians, all this talk was merely fabricated tales, or elaborate Freemasonic stories, with no truth. However, there are legends that declare the importance of specific historical places, or of peculiar families sitting at the center of the Western Initiatic System. Some are even said to be the immediate descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. That's why the bloodline of Jesus was supposedly perpetuated in secret by the aristocracy, to avoid the persecution of the church, that would have naturally accused them of 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"heresy. We can believe, or not, in the possibility of a holy bloodline within the royal families of Europe, however, the “Merovingian Mythos” seems the one that still fascinates many. Occult expert and historian Tracy R. Twyman has been investigating the enigma of the Holy Grail and Rennes-le-Chateau for a long time, and has written extensively about it in Dagobert’s Revenge Magazine , as well as other publications, like in a book from 2004, The Merovingian Mythos and the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, where Twyman claims she discovered the bloodline of the Merovingian’s stems not only from Christ and Mary Magdalene but in fact, goes back to the god-kings and queens of the antediluvian world. This is a hypothesis embraced by many Neo-Templars, and Illuminati Orders such as The Typhonian Order, previously known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis (T.O.T.O.), originally led by an old collaborator of Aleister Crowley, the late British occultist Kenneth Grant (1924–2011) , and his partner Steffi Grant, an Illuminati sect that is now led by his deputy Michael Staley . Grant, who I will analyze further on, envisioned the Merovingian bloodline as a demonic lineage. This should come as no surprise, as inside the Western Initiatic System, we often find a growing dark side of the Illuminati, that is increasingly promoting Satanism, Liberal ideology, and Atheism, as they are all corrupt with greed, power and material wealth. Scums of the earth, like Marina Abramovic, often distort the true figure of Jesus, and what He truly represents for Christians all over the world. I will go back to this point later in the book in relation to the sick beliefs of The Satanic Temple of Lucien Greaves. In the meantime, the Progressive and Liberal -Masonic cabal that controls Europe and the US Deep State, would seem to be extremely confident that their plan to create a “New World Order” is progressing very nicely, especially now with a Jesuit Pope in full control. For several decades, Marxists/Satanists masquerading as “Democrats” and “Republicans” have been gradually undermining and dismantling the United States, and so- called “Regular” Freemasonry has unfortunately done nothing to stop them.

Is it all right to join the Masons? These are questions I receive all the time from my readers. It is important that you have a correct vision about the reality of Freemasonry, its teachings, and its beliefs so that you can approach this subject with understanding and not superficially, like most conspiracy theorists tend to do. Many people who are interested in my experience, ask questions that need a clear and accurate answer, not the confusion and evasion they often receive when they ask such information to an ordinary Mason, who are often ignorant of their own tradition. They most conveniently state they cannot answer most questions, because they have sworn, under penalty of death, not to reveal their Masonic secrets. What a load of crap! An honest Freemason will always answer all your questions as the only secrecy required consists with the signs, handgrips, and words of recognition, 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"that are a means of recognizing each other, necessary in an organization which spans the entire world, and encompasses many languages. These are the only details that cannot be revealed by regular Freemasons to the outside world, but often Freemasons, when asked about their membership by a non-Mason, especially in North America, merely assure you that “Masonry is a Christian organization based on the Bible.” They further assure you that Masonry is in accordance with God’s laws. But is this really true? Do they have the ultimate truth? Why are they so secretive? Well, I will try to answer these three questions before you waste years attacking the wrong enemy on the internet, or joining the wrong form of Freemasonry in search of the Holy Grail, or even worse, being initiated into one of the many Illuminati cults that recruit within Freemasonry, like the Ordo Templi Orientis (known with the acronym O.T.O .). This is a dangerous error, even the more erudite Freemason seems to make these days, often ignoring the possible consequences of such actions. This happened for example, to the late Jeva Singh-Anand, the translator of The Secret School of Wisdom - The Authentic Rituals and Doctrines of the Illuminati , published by Lewis Masonic only a couple of years ago. Jeva enthusiastically joined the O.T.O. wishing to learn more about their Illuminati secrets, and their connections, (if any), to Weishaupt’s Illuminati. He went around the US giving speeches in their lodges, even helping them form an “Education Committee” within their US Grand Lodge, using none other than Weishaupt’s, “Owl of Wisdom” Minerval degree symbology. The “Bird of Minerva” has been a symbol of the goddess of wisdom (Athena/Minerva) for thousands of years. Hegel used it, and the Journal of the Hegel Society of America employs the symbol, and so does the Bohemian Club. In the Cremation of Care ceremony, ritualized at the Bohemian Grove, we hear the “Priest” intone: “O thou, great symbol of all mortal wisdom, Owl of Bohemia, we do beseech thee, grant us thy counsel.” However, Jeva was probably thinking he was immune to all the evil black magic present in the dark side of the Illuminati, but unfortunately, he ended up dead in his basement after committing suicide in October 2015. His wife, a practicing witch, and O.T.O. member was said by some, to be partly responsible for his dramatic ending, but we might never know the truth about this sad episode connected once again, to the dangerous para-Masonic magical order. Remember, the O.T.O. is not Freemasonry, but a dangerous 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Illuminati sect trying to undermine it , “The grand object of Masonry is to promote the happiness of the human race” said Brother George Washington, and this was 100% true until the dark forces of occultism and Satanism screwed up the whole system in the last two centuries, especially thanks to Illuminati orders like the O.T.O. This could happen because the Masonic doctrine is very accepting and open, so it created a loosely knit system of Christians, as well as pagan ideals, in its fold. Furthermore, it is cushioned with allowances for those members who wish to disagree with religious dogmas, and it embraces men of all religions since the 27th of December of 1813, when a great cloud of darkness descended on Freemasonry and the English Tradition of the Craft, with the surrender of the Tradition which was in all aspects, Christian. Earlier on in January 1813 , Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, (27 January 1773 – 21 April 1843), became Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, and in December of that year his brother, Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, became Grand Master of the Antient Grand Lodge of England. On 27 December 1813, the United Grand Lodge of England was constituted at Freemasons’ Hall, London with Prince Augustus as Grand Master. What Freemasonry Today , the official publication of the United Grand Lodge of England wrote in 2014, helps us understand why things changed in Freemasonry after 1813: Augustus had a reputation for open-mindedness and was considered the most liberal of his siblings, being something of a social reformer . He was educated abroad, entering the University of Göttingen in 1786 at the age of thirteen. He was the only one of the princes not to pursue a military career, although some commentators have attributed this to the fact that he suffered from asthma rather than his well-known liberal propensities. In opposition to the views of some of his older brothers, in particular, the Duke of Cumberland, Augustus favored Catholic Emancipation. He was also, despite his devout Christianity, a strong supporter of the Jewish community. Up until 1813, the paragraph “Concerning God and Religion” in Anderson's Constitutions, caused much dissension and controversy in the earlier days of Freemasonry, and in the formative days of the first Grand Lodge, where most Freemasons were actually Christian, even Trinitarian 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Christian as some Masonic websites point out even today. Religious dissension in modern lodges and Grand Lodges seems impossible today, but in the formative days of Freemasonry, it actually played a big part in the Craft ideology, just check out the history of The Rite of Strict Observance. After the allowances made after 1813 , when Masons focused on the non-sectarian character outlined in Anderson’s Constitutions. The second great cloud of darkness descended on Freemasonry only a few decades later, when the Grand Orient of France, which at this time made its support for the Republic official, decided incredibly in 1877, to abolish its requirement that its members believe in the existence of God, and the immortality of the soul, and for its lodges to work “for the Glory of the Great Architect of the Universe”. In theory, each lodge remained free to choose whether or not to continue respecting this fundamental landmark of Freemasonry, but in practice, all references to religion would be phased out of the rituals of the Grand Orient of France, that became the ideal place for the formation of the future leaders of Communist Russia. Masonic philosophy is very vague from this point onwards in Masonic history, and so devious in its application of their original beliefs, that it can mean almost anything to anyone, leaving as I have also outlined in volume 1 of my Confessions, the possibility of a Satanic infiltration wide open, and at the same time making Freemasonry the ideal carrier of the future One World Religion Ideology, promoted today by a Jesuit Pope and the Vatican led New World Order. This means that belonging to Freemasonry today, is profitable for a number of reasons, but often does not make you a better Christian, as the values they are promoting, especially in the first three degrees, are simply Universal values, with no particular attachment to Christian values. Of course, Freemasons can choose a Christian path within Freemasonry, but that’s not everyone’s choice. Freemasons are often informed more than the average person on community and civil affairs because contemporary Masons come from every profession imaginable. They have a vast storehouse of knowledge at their command, which they share with one another, but only a few are true Masons and true Christians at heart, as unfortunately, most have become members of Freemasonry, only to obtain favors. In fact, a helpful principle is that of extending aid to a brother Mason. Each member is dedicated to helping a needy brother wherever or whenever he is able. This is usually a good thing, but membership in a Lodge is for this reason, also very useful for those who seek political 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"office, political favor, employment opportunities and all kinds of advantages. Let me now stress, that this is not what true Freemasonry is all about. A useful timeline and the Law of Use For a more complete understanding of the subjects discussed in this book, I would like you to carefully consider the following words from an ancient aphorism in understanding the use of such “Knowledge”: “The possession of Knowledge, unaccompanied by a manifestation and expression in Action, is like the hoarding of precious metals by the miser—a vain and foolish thing. Forget not The Law of Use, in this and all other things.” Yes, my dear readers “The Law of use” is everything, so use this book to awaken others and manifest its true potential on the future of humanity, not to oppress it further.

THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN’S MINIONS These days Satanists are on the run after recent events have exposed them beyond the so-called conspiracy realm, putting them under the public spotlight like never before. Sally Quinn, the widow of The Washington Pos t’s Ben Bradlee, reveals in her new memoir, that she has practiced the occult for many years, and believes she killed three innocent people using Black Magic. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton , who even attended a voodoo ceremony in Haiti years ago with her husband, confessed that she was so frustrated about the infamous scandal surrounding her use of a private email server, that basically ruined her presidential campaign, that she was “tempted” to construct voodoo dolls in the images of “certain members” of the news media and Congress, and then “stick them full of pins.” This confirms what I have written for years in my books, and now the first edition of Volume 2 of my Confessions series, has apparently forced one of America’s most dangerous Satanic sects to close down their website, after being exposed in my book. They are called the Brotherhood of Satan, and years ago they publicly announced, on a now defunct website ( http://www.grailcode.net ) the following shocking statement: 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"One of these two so-called leaders even said they called the FBI and turned us in as being a Satanic cult. This again is actually amusing.

Many of our High clergy are Freemasons and other related Secret Society members.

The infamous Brotherhood of Satan ( also known with the acronym BOS ), whose elite is made up of deviant Masonic figures, used to publish statements like the following one on the internet, wishing to attract new recruits, and also potential Satanic allies, from other sectarian realities: The Brotherhood of Satan believes in Satan as a very real Entity and Deity, the very Oldest in Nature. The use of the Principles of Brotherhood between all Brotherhood of Satan members is the very cement of our foundation. Is the Brotherhood hiding something by its usage of secrecy in much of what we do in the Shadows? No, we are NOT. We do believe that Ancient Satanic Witchcraft has existed as a true but hidden tradition and therefore we do adhere to our traditions in a manner that is known to us as members of the Craft of Satanism. While the Brotherhood of Satan new Brotherhood generationhas its own Satanic Craft secrets likeall legitimate Dark Orders and Lodgeshave done, we still invite any Satanistor others of the Dark Arts organizations or solitary Dark Witches to ouroffline Sabbat festivals. If you wantto see what we are all about then you should attend one. Just be ready to actually experience Brotherhood Satanism first hand. The destruction of their activities with my publications is a huge success in our battle against Satanism, but this is only the first step thanks to the war we are fighting together, not only for the future of Christianity but also for the future of the Western Initiatic System that needs purification. Recently, author and researcher of weird things, Gregory L. Reece, made another shocking discovery in regards to the Brotherhood of Satan and the mysterious figure, Brother Orion. Greg, who holds a Ph.D. in Religious Studies, reveals in his book, Creatures of the Night: In Search of Ghosts, Vampires, Werewolves and Demons, that David Daniel de Paul is also the man called Orion by the controversial whistleblower William Schnoebelen (b.1949) , ex- Satanic Priest, Witch, Satanist, Ninety Degree Freemason, Vampire and more, who now heads One Accord Ministries . Schnoebelen, who confirmed for the first time in a phone conversation, the identity of the mysterious Orion to Gregory L. Reece [2] He spoke extensively about this mysterious and evil figure who he encountered over 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"thirty years ago, in his book published in the early 90’s entitled Lucifer Dethroned . This book co-authored with his wife, the late Sharon Schnoebelen, who died in 2010, makes some shocking statements. So really is Orion? Well, while the Brotherhood of Satan and David Daniel de Paul officially disavows animal and human sacrifice, Schnoebelen claims otherwise in his book, indicating Orion/ David De Paul as being responsible for a series of terrifying crimes made across the US in the name of Satan. Orion/David De Paul who also signed back in the early 70’s Sharon Schnoebelen’s certificate of advancement to the level of thirty-third degree Mason, told Schnoebelen that “blood was essential for the practice of real magick,” and that, “For the Satanist, the holiest act is to murder a Christian” preferably, “a young girl”. [3] Gregory L. Reece, after confirming the identity of Orion, asks himself if Schnoebelen misrepresented what Orion told him thirty years earlier, or if David Daniel De Paul, aka Pendragon, misrepresented what he actually believes and practices today? For William Schnoebelen also known as Bill, the victims are usually displaced thanks to corruption and blackmail of a funeral director, and the perpetrators are not prosecuted by the authorities because Satanists are usually: “pillars” of the local community – doctors, lawyers, judges, clergy and even police, often recruited and converted to the Brotherhood by “lower-level networks” like “the Masonic lodge”. [4] Maybe instead of suing people, or threatening publishers for exposing them, the Brotherhood of Satan and their “generational Satanists” should be investigated by the FBI in the Trump era. So we can finally end the perverse, and criminal practices of these sick individuals, who can no longer be tolerated in a civil society, if proven true beyond any reasonable thought. This is of course if David Daniel de Paul is indeed Orion, as Schnoebelen claims he is in Reece’s book. Of course, Schnoebelen is considered by the majority of Freemasons as just another anti-mason with wacky ideas, but in this case, we are talking about something well beyond the boundaries of the Craft, or even legality, that is in no way even remotely linked to regular Freemasonry. Think about it, what are we tolerating? 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" FIG 4 – Screenshot of the now defunct website of The Brotherhood of Satan, celebrating 11 years being out in public, before disappearing from the internet after being exposed by the author. Understanding the Metaphysics of Evil 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" To better understand the Western Initiatic System, and the real threat of Satanism, we should go over the topic of metaphysics. As the intelligence of the world expands, we begin to recognize a way of thinking that we will refer to as “ meta-science,\" based on a gradual comprehension of natural law, extending beyond the realm of matter. In an article on “Fatalism and Destiny” in The Times Literary Supplement, this thought is suggested in the form of a question. The author reaches no definite conclusions and is mainly concerned with putting aside, what he assumes to be a tendency among soldiers engaged in war, to adopt the theory of fatalism. Such theories “are strange, because they seem like the intrusion of a forgotten human nature into the rational body of our beliefs.” The soldier in the midst of exploding shells is graciously pardoned for taking refuge in fatalism, and the author wanders, for three columns, around the subject, somehow finding comfort in a distinction between fatalism and destiny , the value of which may not be very clear to the reader. The wave of interest in super-physical research and speculation that is spreading through the intellectual world has a force that seems quite different than the pretence of assuming that all attempts to penetrate the unseen mysteries of nature represent the foolishness of weak minds to be laughed out of court by the sane man in the street. People who have lost dear relations in war are not easily dissuaded, and when they make inquiry, find that belief in the possibility of receiving definite news from those who have passed on is not confined, as they had been told, to weak-minded women and fraudulent fortune-tellers, but is held as a solid conviction by a large number of the most eminent men of the time. So we may be approaching a time when metaphysics of the old-fashioned order—vague speculation about the nature of thought, and the intangible philosophies of Hegel or Schopenhauer—will make way for the development of a meta- science based on as definite a foundation of fact and acquired knowledge as the sciences concerned with the laws governing matter. Meta-science seems to indicate (even in its present stage of development) that “ no life is found, which only to one engine bound, falls off but cycles always round.” Tennyson did not stop, when he wrote the Two Voices , to work out all the consequences of this hypothesis, but amongst others, it suggests that even if no fatalism, guarantees the justice of each individual death on the battle-field, compensation, in the long run, is mathematically certain. And that view has the incidental recommendation of making the 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Free-will of humanity the ultimately dominant force in our progress through the ages. [5] The most troublesome impediment in the way of the progress of meta- science, arises from the irritation many otherwise intelligent people feel when asked to pay attention to some alleged occurrence that does not fit in with their previous knowledge. When new phenomena, arises and can be detected by suitable scientific instruments and reproduced, the irritation soon disappears, and the new discovery passes into the region of common knowledge in the so-called Academic world. But sometimes, a new discovery, though genuine, may for a time be elusive. Consider for a moment the phenomena of mesmerism , now passing into use in medical practice, though very imperfectly understood. The will of the mesmerist can be proven as often as you like, to have a definite effect on the patient, but by reason of not knowing how it operates, impatience prevents the man on the street from believing, though he might just as well disbelieve in the aurora borealis. But in truth, few subjects on which we can speculate are more attractive to the meta-scientist than the rationale of the human will. People generally do not stop to consider that it is really the original cause of almost everything that is accomplished in physical life. No house has ever been built, no machine has ever been constructed, without beginning with some human. Will is the beginning of the activities required to materialize the idea. But when it merely controls the bricklayer, (through the intermediation of wages), and materializes itself by slow degrees, people lose sight of the fact that Will has been the origin of the result. Future science has got to ascertain whether there may not be some more direct way of bringing Will to bear on matter. This brings us to the Metaphysical meaning of evil and why it is so important for the Satanists that are controlling our present reality. Evil is a parasite. It has no permanent life of itself; its whole existence depends on the life it borrows from its parent, and when its connection with the parent is severed, nothing remains. In the Divine Mind, there is no recognition of evil conditions. Such conditions have no basis in reality. They are conjurations of a false consciousness. Apparent evil is the result of ignorance, and when Truth is presented the error disappears. There is but one presence and one power, God omnipotent. But man has the privilege and freedom of using this power at his will. When he misuses it, he brings about inharmonious conditions. Evil appears in the world because man is not in spiritual understanding. He has not learned that all is 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Mind; neither has he conformed to the law of Mind, with the result that inharmony appears in his body and affairs. He can do away with evil by learning rightly to use the One Power. If there were a power of evil, it could not be changed. Evil must be overcome with good. We must dwell in the good so wholly that all the substance of our thoughts and our being is given over to the promotion of good. This is a mental process in which all negation (evil) is denied, and creative, fearless affirmation of God’s perfect good is steadfastly adhered to. [6]  The Satanic trends of the NWO and their teachings Unfortunately, every day, evil and Satanism pollute the Western Initiatic System, with the help of a vast variety of sects and groups like the Brotherhood of Satan, inspired by the darkest side of Illuminati teachings. Many of these topics have been investigated in depth in my previous writings, however, I would like to now introduce a group I have never mentioned before. I believe they are a useful example, and represent better than others, the sick and twisted reality infiltrating and transforming our lives in the Age of the Antichrist. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"They are called The Order of Nine Angles (ONA; O9A), not to be confused with angels, and are a Satanic and Left-Hand Path occult Illuminati group based in the United Kingdom, with affiliated groups in various parts of the globe. They claim to have been established in the 1960s and rose to public recognition in the early 1980s. Describing their approach as “Traditional Satanism”, it has been academically identified as also exhibiting Hermetic and Neo-Pagan elements in its beliefs (something typical of most Illuminati sects). According to the Order's own account, it was established in the Welsh Marches of Western England during the late 1960s, by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre- Christian tradition. This account also states that in 1973, a man named Anton Long was initiated into the group, subsequently becoming its Grand Master. Several academic commentators who studied the ONA, express the view that the name “Anton Long” is probably the pseudonym of the British Neo-Nazi activist David Myatt , although Myatt has denied that this is the case. From the late 1970s onward, Long authored a number of books and articles propagating the Order’s ideas, and in 1988, they began production of their own journal, Fenrir . Through these ventures it established links with other Neo-Nazi Illuminati Satanist groups around the world, furthering their cause through embracing the internet in the 2000s, spreading like malignant cancer in our society, without any possible control, well beyond the boundaries of traditional Generational Satanism . 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"FIG 5 – Baphomet According to the ONA Tradition. The ONA’s writings condone and encourage human sacrifice, a truly horrific thing, referring to their victims as opfers. The ONA outline their views on human sacrifice in a number of documents: A Gift for the Prince – A Guide to Human Sacrifice , Culling – A Guide to Sacrifice II , Victims – A Sinister Exposé , and Guidelines for the Testing of Opfers . According to the ONA’s beliefs, the killer must allow their victim to “self-select” themselves; this is achieved through testing the victim to see if they expose perceived character faults. If this proves to be the case, the victim is believed to have shown that they are worthy of death, and the sacrifice can commence. Those deemed ideal for sacrifice by the group include individuals 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"perceived as being of low character, members of what they deem “sham- Satanic groups” like the Church of Satan and even Aquino’s Temple of Set , that is equally dangerous, as well as “zealous, interfering Nazarenes”, journalists, business figures, and political activists who disrupt the groups operations. Of course, the author of this book has been on the top of their dislike list for years, and this book will not help me get off their blacklist, but this is part of the war we are fighting in these crepuscular times. The ONA explains that because of the need for such “self-selection”, children must never be victims of sacrifice, something of a change from Crowley’s a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim. Let’s also remember that the ONA “despise animal sacrifice, maintaining that it is much better to sacrifice suitable mundanes given the abundance of human dross”. The sacrifice is then carried out through either physical or magical means, at which point the killer is believed to absorb power from the body and spirit of the victim, thus entering a new level of “sinister” consciousness. As well as strengthening the character of the killer by heightening their connection with the forces of death and destruction, such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by the ONA, because they remove from society, individuals whom the group deems to be worthless human beings. Monette noted that no ONA nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner, but that members had joined the police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing. The ONA believe that there are historical precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet, at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set , who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations. [7] So what’s really going on in the murky world of one of the darkest sects operating in the Illuminati Network of today? The ONA promotes the idea that human history can be divided into a series of Aeons just like Aleister Crowley, and the Ordo Templi Orientis have been doing long before the arrival of the ONA onto the Illuminati scene. Each of these supposed Aeon corresponds to a period of time in 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"human civilization and the ONA expresses the view that the current Aeonic civilization is that of the Western, but claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the “Magian/Nazarene” influence of Judeo- Christian religion, which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order, termed the “Imperium” that seems to be another word for New Word Order. According to their teachings, this is necessary in order for a Galactic civilization to form, in which an “Aryan” society will colonize the Milky Way . Can you believe all this rubbish? It’s pretty incredible, these guys seem more out of it than Crowley’s lot ever were. They advocate a spiritual path in which the practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society, committing crimes, embracing political extremism and violence, and carrying out an act of human sacrifice . ONA members practice magick, believing that they are able to do so through channeling energies into this “causal” realm from an “acausal” realm, where the laws of physics do not apply, with such magical actions designed to aid in the ultimate establishment of the Imperium (the NWO...). The ONA lacks any central authority or structure, they instead operated as a broad network of associates - termed the collective - who are inspired by the texts originally authored by Long and other members of the Inner ONA. The group comprises largely of clandestine cells, termed “nexions”, as well as gangs known as Dreccs , artists known as Balobians , and folk mystics known as Rounwytha. With the first nexion based in Shropshire, Western England, the majority of groups have been established in the British Isles and Germany, although others have been formed elsewhere in Europe, Russia, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Academic estimates suggest that the number of individuals broadly associated with this neo-Illuminati Order fall in the low thousands. If this is true, it would mean that they are in the same league as the Ordo Templi Orientis Caliphate, despite the fact that they would probably state the contrary, to impress you. The truth is that members of this order never exceeded more than three thousand members. Often, some of the ONA members secretly collaborate with the O.T.O. and I noticed in my time in the O.T.O., that the O.T.O. guys were pretty scared of them and treated them with admiration for their supposed evil deeds. So the ONA is not too big, but big enough to influence magically, a large number of people around them, just as the O.T.O. does every day. Once, I was given an internal document of the ONA based on Hypnotism and Mesmerism apparently written by their inner circle, called the Ayin 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Quadma'ah Movement . I must admit that the document in question is useful to understand the more intellectual side of Satanism within the Illuminati and the New World Order, and clears up for the more attentive reader, that great secret of mind control and manipulation used since ancient times by the Illuminati, known in the esoteric world as Animal Magnetism [8] Animal magnetism, also known as Mesmerism, was the name given by the German doctor Franz Mesmer in the 18th century, to what he believed to be an invisible natural force ( lebensmagnetismus ) possessed by all living/animate beings (humans, animals, vegetables, etc.). He believed that the force could have physical effects, including healing. He tried persistently but without success, to achieve scientific recognition for his theories, that were embraced by the various Illuminati circles. The vitalist theory attracted numerous followers in Europe and the United States and was popular into the 19th century. Practitioners were often known as magnetizers, rather than mesmerists. For about 75 years from its beginnings in 1779, it was an important specialty in medicine and continued to have some influence for about another 50 years. Hundreds of books were written on the subject between 1766 and 1925. Today it is almost entirely forgotten. [9] Having said that, the Illuminati never forgot Mesmer’s teachings, and secretly used them to develop much more complex methods of mind control and hypnotism, influencing the study and formation of certain forms of neurolinguistics, which is the study of the neural mechanisms in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language, all techniques used in modern publicity and political propaganda. The internal document of the ONA Let’s analyze this document from the ONA internal circle. It will no doubt put into question whether Hypnotism or Mesmerism forms any legitimate or fundamental part of Occultism, and indeed I have asked myself this question many times. I finally decided to include this document in my book, as it clears up many aspects unknown to many, of the hidden links between Hypnotism or Mesmerism, and what we all define as the Illuminati. So let’s see what’s their take is on the writings called HYPNOTISM AND MESMERISM by Sepharial: 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"“The whole of the magnetic art, then known as Fascination and the Laying on of Hands , was an essential factor in the curriculum of the thaumaturgist... Scripture references to the transmission of vital energy to those sick or dying, or even death to all appearances, are numerous and well-known. The use of oil as a medium for the conveyance and retention of the vital or magnetic energy is also noticed and is commonly in use in India and other parts of the Orient at this day. Mesmerism may be distinguished in a popular manner from Hypnotism in that it presumes the existence of an effluvium which is in the nature of a subtle essence capable of being transmitted from one body to another under the direction of the Will. Paracelsus (1493/4 -1541) born Theophrastus von Hohenheim called it the Archeu s or Liquor Vitae : The Archeus is an essence, he says, which is distributed equally in all parts of the body if the latter is in a healthy condition; it is the invisible nutriment from which the body draws its strength, and the qualities of each of its parts correspond to the nature of the physical parts which contain it. . . . The Archeus is of a magnetic nature and attracts or repels other forces belonging to the same plane. The individual power of resistance will determine how far a man is subject to astral influences. The vital force is not enclosed in man but radiates around him like a luminous sphere, and may be made to act at a distance. In those semi-material rays, the imagination may produce healthy or morbid effects. It may poison the essence and cause diseases, or it may purify it after it has been made impure and so restore the health. . . . If we separate the vital force from the physical form, the latter will die and putrefy; and by impregnating a dying body with vitality, it may be made to live again. Paracelsus further states that disease may be transmitted from one person to another, or from man to animal, or animal to plant, by means of the magnetic emanations, and we have ocular demonstration that this is a belief firmly held by those nations of the East among whom it is practiced. The story of the Gadarene swine is in line with our own experience of the epidemic of crime which follows upon the death of a renowned criminal . ‘If a person dies , says Paracelsus, and seriously desires that another should die with him, his imagination may create a force that may draw a menstruum from the dead body to form a corpus, and it may be projected by the impulse given to it by the thought of the dying person toward that other so that he may also die. Such especially may be the case with a woman dying of puerperal fever, for if such should desire that the whole world might die with her, an epidemic may be the consequence of her 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"poisoned imagination.’ The suggestion, in this case, has regard to the known contagious influence of the corpse of a woman dying of puerperal fever. The point, however, is that the will of the dying person is capable of distributing such contagion. I have cited these opinions in order to show that Mesmerism, of which Paracelsus was undoubtedly the earliest known European exponent, has little in common with the beliefs and practice of the Hypnotists. The Mesmerists, or those who believe in the transmission of animal magnetism , whether we regard it as the Archeus of Paracelsus or the Odyle of Reichenbach, affirm that the emanation is most active through certain channels - e. g. the eyes, the lips, and the finger-tips. They also state that certain natural bodies, such as oil and water, are capable of holding the magnetism better than others; while vinegar is capable of augmenting the efflux and thus of increasing the transmission. Volatile spirits are, on the contrary, completely destructive of the magnetic transmission and storage. Earth and clay are excellent storage mediums or mumia as Paracelsus would call them. There is nothing singular in this if we reflect that all the forces of nature of which we have any knowledge require certain media through which to operate. Electrical energy, for example, cannot be conveyed through a length of rope or wood, but only through a natural conductor of electricity, such as steel or copper. When it is said that Jesus spat upon the ground and made clay and anointed the eyes of the man who was blind from birth, we see that use was made of the natural odylic power of the saliva, and the powerful storage medium of clay or earth. The rest is explained by the powerful will of the magician as expressed completely and decisively in the single exclamation Ephphatha! The laying on of hands for the cure of sickness is one phase of Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism of which there is abundant evidence and which conclusively proves the existence of the magnetic fluid. Touching for doing the King’s evil or scrofula was in use among our own kings until Rome discountenanced any delegation of its powers. Le Roy te touche, Dieu te guerys (The King touches thee, God heals thee) had brought new life to thousands before the Divine right of kings was assailed. Dr. James Esdaile, at one time the Presidency Surgeon at Calcutta, has left us a very remarkable series of cases which prove the surpassing value of 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Mesmerism in the medical and surgical treatment of disease. His book on Natural and Mesmeric Clairvoyance is among the best upon this subject. Incidentally, he mentions two phenomena by which I think I may claim complete justification for the inclusion of this subject in a work upon magic. The first is the dislocation of the senses. Normally each of the senses has its appropriate organ, as the eye, ear, nose, etc. They are not in themselves the only organs of the corresponding senses of sight, hearing, smell, etc., but have become specialized as such. This is shown by the fact that in natural and induced somnambulism, the whole sensorium may be transferred to the finger-tips or the pit of the stomach, or even the soles of the feet. Fredrika Wanner, better known as the Seeress of Prevorst, was a natural somnambulist, and in her trances was particularly sensitive to the presence of other persons, discriminating between them as painful or soothing to her. And on such occasions, it was found that her eyes being closed, or the senses incapable of being affected by ordinary stimuli, she could see, hear, and even taste by means of the epigastric region. Prof. Dumas is quoted by Dr. Esdaile to the same effect : It is possible that, by a singular concourse of circumstances, certain organs become capable of exercising properties and fulfilling functions to which they have hitherto been strangers and which even belonged to different organs. If rare and extraordinary facts did not inspire distrust, I could allege the singular transference of the hearing and sight, which, abandoning their usual seat, have appeared to be transferred to the stomach - so that sounds and colors excited there the same sensations as are ordinarily conveyed through the ears and eyes. Five years ago a young woman from the department of Ardèche, who gave an example of a very strange phenomenon, came to Montpellier to consult the doctors for a hysteric affection attended with catalepsy. She referred all the sensations of sight, hearing and smell to the region of the stomach, the appropriate organs being insensible to the usual stimuli . The second phenomenon to which I would call attention is the transference of the senses. In the former cases we have the dislocation of the normal centers of sensation to the region of the sympathetic ganglion at the pit of the stomach, and now we may consider the marvelous fact of sensation being transferred from one person to another. Finding a specially sensitive subject in the person of Babu Lali Mohun Mitra, a young Hindu of twenty- two years, Dr. Esdaile, after curing him 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"of a loathsome disease for which he had come to the hospital, subjected him to some experimental development. He would place his watch in Mitra’s hand and with a few passes would render the whole arm so rigid that under no bribe or persuasion or threat could the young man stir a finger to lose the watch as he was bidden. “Seeing this man’s extreme sensibility, I thought it probable,” says Esdaile, “that he might exhibit community of taste with his mesmerizer, and here is the result of the first experiment made upon him.” He had never heard of such a thing nor had I even tried it before. “One day that the Babu came to the hospital to pay his respects after getting well, I took him into a side room and, mesmerizing him till he could not open his eyes, I went out and desired the native assistant- surgeon to procure me some salt, a slice of lemon, a piece of gentian, and some brandy, and to give them to me in any order he pleased when I opened my mouth. We returned, and, blindfolding Lali Mohun, I took hold of both his hands and opening my mouth had a slice of half- rotten lime-fruit put into it by my assistant. Having shown it, I asked, Do you taste anything? ‘Yes; I taste a nasty old lime,’ and he made wry faces in correspondence. He was equally correct with all the other substances, calling the gentian by its native name, cheretea; and when I tasted the brandy he called it shrâb (the general name for wine and spirits); being asked what kind, he said: “What I used to drink –brandy”. It should here be remarked that Dr. Esdaile had cured this man of confirmed brandy-drinking as well as of his terrible disease. As to the local rigidity of the arm of the patient who otherwise had full and perfect control of his faculties, it should be remarked that the mesmerizer can not only saturate his patient with his own nervous fluid but also determine the energy to various parts of the body so as to place them in effect beyond the patient’s control. In a similar manner, local anæsthesia or insensibility can be produced at the will of the operator. When the volition can no longer act upon a part of the body, it is found that its sensibility is at the same time inhibited, which proves that volition and sensation are consentaneous. When a voluntary action is restored, sensation is simultaneously developed in the part. The nervous fluid not only follows the direction of the will but is moreover impressed with our individuality, both physical and mental. It bears the signature of our thought, it carries the healthy or diseased tendencies of our body, it is moved by our will and colored by our desires and passions. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The dictum of Lord Bacon: ‘ The human mind can be placed in communication with other minds and transmit their impressions,’ is not inclusive enough to cover the phenomena of statuvolism, animal magnetism, electro-biology, mesmerism, or by whatsoever name we may indicate the use of this mysterious agent. It is a force that can be set in motion at any time and made to operate at any distance apart from any suggestion of the effects it is required to produce. Herein it differs entirely from the “hypnotic suggestion” of the medical schools and the “auto- suggestion” which the critical writers wholly unskilled in the knowledge of Occultism bring to bear an explanation of every fulfilled prediction, every thaumaturgic effect, every case of healing which is in distinction from the known and approved methods, the clinic and pharmacy, of the medical profession. On the question of animal magnetism, either as a psychological or a therapeutic agent, the Occultist will always prefer the experience of such men as Esdaile, Gregory, and Baron Du Potet to the uninstructed opinions of the critic, however skillful he may be in his own field of research or work. Baron Du Potet, in his Manual de l’Etudiant Magnetiseur , says: ‘Nature herself discovered the secret to me. And how? By producing before my own eyes, without waiting for me to search for them, indisputable facts of sorcery and magic. And what is it determines these sudden impulses, these raving epidemics, antipathies and cries, the convulsions that one can make durable? What if not the very principle we employ, the agent so thoroughly well-known to the ancients? What you call nervous fluid or magnetism the men of old called occult force, the power of the soul, subjection, magic! An element existing in nature, unknown to most men, gets hold of a person and withers and breaks him down as the raging hurricane does the bulrush. It scatters men far apart, it strikes them in a thousand places at the same time without their perceiving the invisible foe or being able to protect themselves. But that this element should choose friends and elect favourites, obey their thoughts, answer to the human voice and understand the meaning of traced signs, that is what people cannot realize and what their reason rejects, and that is what I saw; and I say it here most emphatically that for me it is a truth and a fact demonstrated forever!’ And this is a phase of Animal Magnetism that has been repeatedly offered as the only intelligible explanation of the phenomena of sorcery 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"and as repeatedly rejected by the schools that have no knowledge either of the facts or the agent which alone is capable of explaining them. According to the experience of mesmerists, the magnetizer can communicate his fluid to a variety of objects, which thus become conductors or agents of his action to all persons with whom he is in magnetic relations. These agents are water, oil, woolen and cotton materials, trees, etc. Charles Dickens found a means of magnetizing water by means of pieces of sugar which had been subjected to magnetization, which were then readily distributed among the old country folk in Kent. Magnetized water is one of the most powerful agents that can be employed, inasmuch as it is conveyed at once to the stomach and thence distributed throughout the system, acting upon the circulation and the digestion, taking in turn, according to the immediate needs of the body, the place of anodyne, diaphoretic, prophylactic and purgative. An agent of such universal utility is necessarily not thought very highly of by those whose business it is to scare Nature into obedience by cryptic prescriptions and unnatural concoctions. Given normal health and a desire to heal the sufferer, you may take a vessel of water, and after thoroughly cleansing the hands, dip them in vinegar. Shake off the superfluous moisture by flicking the hands violently towards the ground. Continue so to do until the finger-tips tingle, with a slight streaming sensation down the forearm and hand. Now take a clean glass and pour into it some fresh cold water, which must not have been boiled or heated previously. Place the glass in the left hand with the fingers closed around it to steady it, and with the right hand make passes from above the glass downwards for a score of strokes or more. Then bunch the finger-tips above the mouth of the glass, bringing them almost in contact with the water, and impregnate it with the nervous fluid by a sustained effort of the will to that effect, letting the mind dwell the while upon the result you would obtain. A glass of water may thus be treated in from one to two minutes. Thus given to the patient it immediately goes to work and produces the most remarkable results without in any way complicating matters, as may be readily done by the administering of improper drugs, and without having any deleterious reaction, even when used as a soporific. That such an agent, so inoffensive, so natural and, above all, so efficacious and sure, should have escaped the recognition of medical men appears to me to be inexplicable, except on the grounds of complete ignorance of its properties and action. I do not pretend to explain by what magical process the mind of man is capable of acting upon a glass of water to the end that it becomes either a powerful astringent or a laxative, or an anodyne, or a stimulant. The chemical nature 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of the water remains unchanged. It is still a mechanical compound of H2O. But something has happened, and this something the will of man can determine while yet his intellect fails to understand. What I am now saying is not a tradition or an effort of the imagination. It is the record of my own personal experience. Suggestion ? How does one suggest purgation to a babe that is teething or peaceful sleep to one delirious ? The suggestion, if there is one, is directed, not to the mind of the patient, but to Nature herself, and the suggestion of an intent will is equivalent to a command. In the use of magnetized water as a purgative, no colic pains are felt either during or after the action. As an anodyne it leaves no sense of depression or lassitude behind it; while as a tonic it is not accompanied by any rise in temperature nor followed by the slightest constipation. A magnetic subject will readily distinguish magnetized water from water that has not been so treated, and I have known persons who could normally distinguish between them, though at first, I was unwilling to believe this and only convinced myself of it after trying a number of tricks to discover if there were a possibility of suggestion or fancy. But all I discovered was the fact that in some remarkable way magnetic water could be distinguished by its taste. But whatever agent we make use of for the purpose of conveying the nervous or vital fluid, it has been thought, even by those who practice magnetism, that rapport with the patient must first have been established. This, however, is not the case; though undoubtedly it is more certain in its action when magnetization by contact has preceded the use of an agent. The agent is the means of continuing magnetization, and especially of attacking diseases that are internal and deep-seated and not merely nervous or superficial. But for all that, there is. no reason whatsoever why magnetization should not be begun by means of a suitable agent. Contactual magnetism is not generally effective at once, but becomes so by persistence, the action being cumulative. So if water or any other agent is persisted with, it will bring about the desired effect. Of this I am quite certain since I have treated persons at a distance by this means alone, never having set eyes on them. Yet so wonderful is the sympathy existing throughout Nature, that I have been presently conscious of changes taking place in my own body, of pains and sickness, which had no other origin than the subtle connection of sympathy between my subject and myself viâ the agent I had employed. I know of persons who are capable of communicating their sensations at a great distance to one with whom they 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"are in close sympathy, though nothing in the nature of thought transference is observable between them. With others, there is ready communication of thought or of mental images but no community of sensation. Hypnotism proposes to secure the same results. as magnetization by mechanically- induced trance supplemented by suggestion. But while this process lends itself peculiarly to the production of phenomena, and is extremely useful for experimental purposes and psychic research, it cannot pretend to have the same therapeutic value as magnetization, inasmuch as it does nothing to reinforce nature or to supplement depleted vitality. Where insensibility is the effect aimed at it is equally useful, and as in all induced somnambulism the automatic and subconscious self is rendered alert and active, very valuable results may be produced by hypnotic suggestion. If, however, you induce the hypnotic sleep by any of the usual methods and then stand aside while a phonographic record film is set in action to voice the number of original “suggestions,” the effect will surprise many into an entirely new view of the matter, and those who do not now believe that the personal factor is at all considerable, will come to the conclusion that it is the only factor which counts for anything in the whole process. The complete insensibility to written or spoken instructions other than those which pass through the mind of the magnetizer, is in itself a suggestion which the upholders of the non-magnetic position would do well to ponder. I prefer, however, to leave the schools of the Salpétrière and Nancy to thresh out the question to its natural and inevitable conclusion. Deleuze , who followed the teaching of Puysegur, of Mesmer, Van Helmont and Paracelsus , has some excellent admonitions to those anxious to practice Animal Magnetism , which may very suitably be quoted in conclusion: ‘Persons who follow this subject may be divided into two classes. The first class comprehends those who, having recognized in themselves the faculty of doing good by magnetism, or at least hoping to succeed therein, wish to make use of it in their families, or among their friends, or with some poor patients, but who, having duties to fulfill or business to follow, do not magnetize except in circumstances where it appears to them necessary, without seeking publicity, without any motive but that of charity, without any other aim than that of curing or relieving suffering humanity. The second class is composed of men who, having leisure, wish to join in the practice of magnetism, the study of the phenomena it exhibits, to enter largely into it, to establish treatments for taking care of several patients at a time, to form pupils capable of aiding them, to have somnambulists who 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"may enlighten them to examine closely, compare and arrange the phenomena, in such a way as to establish a regular code of laws whose principles may be certain, and whose consequences, extending daily, may lead to new applications. This class is separated from the preceding by a great number of degrees which must be successively mounted before one can find oneself situated where he can command a more extensive horizon. I, therefore, advise those of the former class not to think of passing beyond their limits unless they are masters of their own time and have some preliminary knowledge. Their lot is very good; they are strangers to the vanities and inquietudes which attend new attempts, to the uncertainty which springs from the conflict of opinions and of various points of view under which things are presented to us; they taste without mixture or distraction the satisfaction of doing good. . . . As to the persons who desire to belong to the second class, I advise them to consider at first the extent of the career they will have to run. It is better not to enter it than to stop in the midst of their enterprise. In what pertains to practice, a prudent simplicity is preferable to science. In what relates to theory, imperfect notions expose us to dangerous errors. The laborer who cultivates his farm as his fathers did before him, collects every year the price of his labors. Should he give way to an inclination to pursue experimental methods, he may be ruined before he is enlightened by his own experience.’ Up to a point, this is very good advice, but it is doubtful whether any amount of advice, however sound, will deter man from making experiments and sacrificing both life and fortune to the satisfaction of that desire for knowledge which is inherent in every active and well-developed mind. As between the curative and experimental practice of Mesmerism and Hypnotism, there can be little doubt that Mesmerism, as understood by its best exponents, is more adapted to the curative method, while Hypnotism is peculiarly adapted to the development of experimental psychology. [10] To amplify and speed up the effects of mind control, hypnosis is often used. So can hypnosis be used to make someone do something against his or her own will? This question has been the source of great controversy in the past but we can now hear a professional opinion, from Dr. John Ryder Ph.D. who served as a consultant about hypnosis in Woody Allen’s film, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion , in which the character of Voltan uses hypnosis to get others to steal for him, without recalling the event. 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" So, can hypnosis be used for mind control? This is what Dr. Ryder thinks about it: ‘There has certainly been a lot of research on the subject. The CIA and KGB have both experimented with hypnosis to create the perfect spy or even an assassin. But while I have read many stories about these experiments, I've never seen any proof of their success. Much may be possible in the dark and sinister underworld of spies and madmen, but university research on the possibilities has always been limited by ethics. Could you be hypnotized and forced to do something illegal or diabolical? The general answer is that you cannot. There is a possibility, however, that if one had unlimited resources of money, power, and time, devious plans could be designed: There really were many secret experimental programs like “MK-Ultra” that used hypnosis and drugs to push mind-control to its limits. Is it possible that your friendly neighbor could have been implanted with a program to suddenly become a killer when “triggered” by the right signal? What has been documented is that if you found a subject whose personality was deviant, to begin with, and wanted to direct their minds to do something extreme like planting a bomb or commit an assassination, you may be able to guide him or her to do it—with or without hypnosis. The hypnotic trance is a state of awareness that makes a person more easily persuaded. But the art of persuasion relies on many factors. To convince a normal person to become a killer is extremely unlikely. But if you are able to use coercion—such as kidnapping and threatening the life of their child—a person could very well be able to do anything to protect their offspring. Similarly, it may be possible to convince a person that something horrific will happen unless they follow your instructions precisely. Hypnosis could be used to plant such images, feelings, and stories in an innocent person who may then give in to the pressure and commit an attack they would otherwise never consider. You may have read in the spy novels about nefarious masterminds who use so-called “mind-control” techniques to program innocents to do their bidding like so many robots. And again, while this is unlikely, evildoers may be able to recruit the types of individual whose personality already is ready, if not eager, for violence, which could presumably include combat veterans who killed many enemy combatants in active duty. Perhaps this person also has strong philosophical leanings that following orders is correct, regardless 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"of the consequences. If such a person volunteers for a covert project and enough time is spent applying all sorts of techniques to “reprogram” the subject, anything may be possible. Hypnosis could be used to promote a complete mind reprogramming and solidify a specific plan with great detail—and create a hypnotized walking time-bomb.’ [11] These words are a confirmation that Mind control can be defined as a coercive process to get an individual to think or act a certain way by impairing their ability to think independently, and the Illuminati know this very well. Rational analysis, conscious decision making, and independent judgment seem suspended when you know how to induce people in a hypnotic trance. This is a bonus for Illuminati cult leaders who, after all, do not want the members or their victims thinking for themselves. So add to mind control hypnosis and its effects, and you have an incredibly powerful weapon and a dangerous set of tools the Illuminati can use to manipulate others to do things that violate their own morals and ethics. However, the ancient Druids were not just using hypnosis when they created 'phantom armies', using their harps to focus 'harmonic force' such as the 'Lost Chord'. The walls of Jericho were probably brought down by this same harmonic force. The importance of the quantum physics research that recognizes \"Aum' or the \"Holy SPIRIT\" presaged the nature of the construction of matter, and consciousness as a penultimate reality has opened the proverbial Pandora's Box. It has done this by uniting the worlds of matter and spirit under the gaze of intellectual speculation. It has done this without the necessary moral or ethical prerequisites! [12]  51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Egyptian Sexual Energy and the Illuminati Aleister Crowley, Kenneth Grant, Sex & The LAM Current. William S. Burroughs wrote, “ In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen.” Well these words written by someone who used to be a close friend of my grandmother, known as Anne Cumming or Felicity Mason (1917 –1993) , made me reflect on the fact that it was no coincidence that my grandmother was born, similar to the infamous Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), into what used to be a successful brewing family of Victorian Middle-Class respectability. My grandmother, just as Crowley, had an indulgent life courtesy of James Grimble Groves (1854- 1914) , a member of parliament and a brewery owner. And it was thanks to my grandmother that I actually received my first introduction to the work of Aleister Crowley, described by Matthew Levi Stevens, (another old acquaintance of my grandmother), in the following way : One of the most notorious characters of his day, and is very likely one of the most influential – though still controversial – figures in the world of Ritual Magic, a veritable Picasso of the Modern Occult Revival. Self- styled ‘The Great Beast 666’ and Prophet of the Aeon of Horus – his defiant, libertarian New Age, with its Message of “Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole of the Law” – he was dubbed by the press of his day “The Wickedest Man in the World.” Aleister Crowley was, if nothing else, an adventurer – in mind, body, and spirit – and a seeker after new sensations, new insights, and new experiences. An inheritance as a young man left him free to devote himself to a life of travel and exploration, in the realms of sex, drugs, and occultism as much as the geographical. For Matthew Levi Stevens , a published author, occultural commentator, and Enochian & Hermetic magical practitioner, Crowley sought to bring forth a new approach to magic, which he felt was better suited to the fast- developing Modern Age of the Twentieth Century, and here is what Matthew Levi Stevens had to say about my grandmother, Felicity Mason: Remembering Felicity Mason, who was born 14th December 1917. Heiress, former debutante, British Intelligence Agent, occasional actress, and PR to the Italian film industry, writer, traveler, and pioneering sexual adventurer. She met William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, and Hamri the Painter in Morocco in the 1950’s, remaining lifelong friends with all 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"three.” World adventurer definitely fits both characters connected to a rather different perception of reality, as well as the controversial subject of sexuality, lived to the max, in the most unusual and eccentric way, often mixed with unusual occult techniques used for smashing the surrounding reality and reaching alien contact. Crowley once wrote in a letter to a disciple included in his book Magick Without Tears – the following statement regarding his alien beliefs: My observation of the Universe convinces me that there are beings of intelligence and power of a far higher quality than anything we can conceive of as human; that they are not necessarily based on the cerebral and nervous structures that we know, and that the one and only chance for mankind to advance as a whole is for individuals to make contact with such Beings. So, as well as a pioneer in the realms of magic & mysticism, Crowley, was also what you could define nowadays, as an alien Contactee. In 1918, Crowley was, in fact, living in the furnished rooms of a notorious building based in Central Park West, New York City, when he decided to embark on a series of experiments in order to contact “higher intelligences” with the help of his then-mistress and magickal partner, Roddie Minor aka “The Camel.” What most people don’t know is that my grandmother Felicity, rented an apartment in the same building during her time in New York, often visited by her dear friend William Burroughs. Only a coincidence? Of course “there are no coincidences” as Burroughs once said, “in the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen.” Interestingly enough, Burroughs once described meeting “little grey men” when he was only four years old, and my grandmother made sure I was one of the first kids to watch E.T. during my stay in New York in June 1982. Crowley and Minor began in that New York building, what Crowley later called The Amalantrah Workings . As author, and journalist, James Donahue reminds us, they were performances of sexual and ceremonial magick in an attempt to open a portal to other dimensions and make physical contact with other intelligences. During his evocations, Minor opened her mind with the help of hashish and opium and had visions of a king, a small boy and a wizard that introduced himself as Amalantrah. Thus the name of the project. The wizard’s message to Crowley was to “find the egg.” To anyone else, such a message might have fallen on deaf ears, but to Crowley, who only 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"14 years earlier had encountered yet another spiritual entity that dictated the words of Liber al vel Legis , best known as the Book of the Law , this message had a special meaning. A verse in Chapter Two, line 49, quotes Hadit, the energy of the Universe as declaring: “I am unique & conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned & dead! Amen. (This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as a babe in an egg.)” This symbol, Crowley determined, is that of Harpocrates, the Egyptian image of Horus the child. He is seen as the babe in the egg of blue and seated on a lily pad. The Book of the Law was delivered in 1904 as a warning to mankind. The warning was that unless we changed our course, we would bring about a premature death of our planet and consequently, deal with the harsh new Eon of Horus. While portrayed as an innocent child in one instance, the Egyptians also saw Horus as a hawk-headed god of war and vengeance. The warning was that if the human race failed to take care of the planet and shake off its dependence on enslaving religious systems, it would have to deal with the hawk-headed image of Horus. The job of Horus is to assist the human race in making contact with Lucifer, our alien progenitor. Thus the instruction by the mystical wizard to Crowley, via the woman in that New York flat in 1918, was not taken lightly by Crowley. That the world was at war at that time may have made it seem to Crowley that time was running out and that it was his personal duty to make contact with the child. Crowley may well have assumed that Horus would arrive as an alien. This would explain his intense interest in making contact through a magick ritual. Eventually, Crowley succeeded in making contact with the alien figure in his remarkable drawing, which has a strong resemblance to contemporary descriptions of the alien contacts known as the grays. It is believed that Lam was a physical manifestation through a portal created by Crowley’s magick. [13] In regards to Aleister Crowley and his connection to the alien /UFO phenomena, this is what Matthew Levi Stevens points out, in his short essay from January 2016 entitled Black to Grey Aleister Crowley, Kenneth Grant & Lam : The Workings typically proceeded with Minor acting as a medium, having visions and clairaudient communications, which Crowley would rigorously interrogate for any symbolic meaning, and then interpret. At least one intelligence may even have come through to some level of manifestation: the enigmatic being that has come to be known as LAM. Also at this time in New York, Crowley indulged his recently revived passion for painting, exhibiting a selection of his works in 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Greenwich Village under the title of ‘Dead Souls.’ Crowley was a decidedly self-taught artist, and his work is often crude, generally naive, but certainly vivid. One drawing in the show was the portrait of a figure with a large, domed head, looking remarkably like what would become the standard image of the Grey Alien in later UFO lore – except for the eyes, which are fairly narrow slits rather than the more usual reptilian ray-ban look. Crowley also included the drawing as a frontispiece, titled simply ‘The Way’, to an edition of the founder of Theosophy Madame Blavatsky’s enigmatic work, The Voice of Silence, to which he had added a Commentary, which he published the following year, 1919. The caption underneath the picture read: LAM is the Tibetan word for Way or Path, and LAMA is He who Goeth, the specific title of the Gods of Egypt, the Treader of the Path, in Buddhistic phraseology. Its numerical value is 71, the number of this book. Apart from that, there is no further commentary on the picture by Crowley – or anybody else, for that matter – until the picture passes into the hands of Kenneth Grant who was an English occultist and writer who met Aleister Crowley in the last years of The Great Beast’s life, when the ailing and wizened Magus was slowly dying from the cumulative ravages of a lifetime of excess in the somewhat unlikely setting of a guesthouse in Hastings, on the South Coast of England. After corresponding, the young Grant was invited to go and stay with the aged Crowley as a kind of informal secretary-cum- personal assistant. There has been much arguing back-and-forth and bitter wrangling over just how much Grant’s time with the Beast can be counted towards the claim that he was Crowley’s successor, particularly where the vexed matter of the title to his Ordo Templi Orientis is concerned, but that is not really of relevance here. What is of significance is that at some point before his death in 1947, Crowley presented the drawing of LAM – or the Lama as he referred to it, which he said he had drawn from life (!) – to Grant, planting a powerful magickal seed in the young man’s imagination. Drawing on his apprenticeship with Crowley, Grant would go on to form a version of the O.T.O. – which would eventually become known as “The Typhonian Order” to distinguish it from the so-called Caliphate O.T.O., which has incorporated as a copyright and legal entity in the U.S.A. – starting with his New Isis Lodge, which Grant wrote was: . . . evolved by the present writer during the years 1955-1962 . . . for purposes of traffic with the Outer Ones. – Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways (1990) The godfather of Modern Wicca, Gerald Gardner, had been part of 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Grant’s circle in London, as was occult artist Austin Osman Spare and alchemist David Curwen – both of whom had been mentors in their way to Grant – and also Surrealist painter Ithell Colqhuoun. Apart from his invaluable personal memoirs of Crowley and Spare, and some fine volumes of occult fiction, Kenneth Grant is probably best known for the nine volumes of his three ‘Typhonian Trilogies’ written between 1972 and 2002. One of the few interviews ever given by Grant, for the Skoob Occult Review in 1990, includes the following exchange: Q: What is the purpose of your books? KG: The main purpose is to prepare people for encounters with unfamiliar states of consciousness. Q: Do these include extraterrestrial encounters? KG: Yes, extra-, sub-, and ultra-terrestrial encounters. Grant has included Crowley’s portrait of “The Lama” in a number of his books, referring to him in his Outside the Circles of Time (1980) as an extra-terrestrial and praeterhuman Intelligence and also asserting that: Lam is now known to be a link between the star systems of Sirius and Andromeda. He also points out an interesting resonance with the number 71, which Crowley originally attributed to Lam in 1918: . . . I note that Jacques Vallee cites an entity calling itself 7171 who claimed to be connected with UFOs. (UFOs: The Psychic Solution, p.83). Grant also sees meaning in the fact that 1947, “[T]he year of the first massive UFO sightings”, was also the year that Aleister Crowley passed from this life . . . As a result, a Cult of Lam has evolved within the Typhonian Order – which continues since Grant’s death under the custodianship of his former right- hand-man, now successor, Michael Staley. Experimental yoga-based methods involving mantra, meditation and visualization have been developed for making contact with Lam, or the Current he represents. Doubtless, the work continues, in hope that at least some of us can be prepared, for as Kenneth Grant stated: If man is able to integrate these new experiences into his psyche he must begin NOW to think in terms at least of an extraterrestrial encounter. If he does this the rest may follow . . . the faculty of intuitive insight may be awakened and aligned with such alien concepts.” [14] A great analysis by Matthew Levi Stevens, and even if the words of the 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"lat e Grant about Crowley and Parsons opening a dimensional portal, and probably ushering in the era of the UFO, might seem for most people too good to be true, those who will rea d The Invisible Master: Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors and the puppet masters who pull the strings of Occult Power from The Alien World , and study my past work, in particular, volume 1 of my Confessions; will know this is no joke.

Born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1967, Vadge Moore was a disciple of the late Kenneth Grant , who developed an early interest in music, and an equally-strong affinity for writing and the occult, a bit like myself. However, Moore is a much darker character than I, drawn to all things Satanic and dangerous since his childhood. His heroes were people like Keith Moon, the drummer from the band The WHO, the AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, gonzo-journalist Hunter S. Thompson, and of course, the band Kiss, that for some, their true meaning is in the acronym, Knights in Satan’s Service . Vadge Moore’s internet bio says: Later, a keen attraction to the dark arts was to develop in Vadge, giving birth to a lifelong obsession with the notorious English Magus, Aleister Crowley. Always fascinated with the violent and perverse, as a teenager Vadge became involved with the early '80s hardcore punk movement, which was then growing in influence on the West Coast. Further on in his bio we also find out his connection with Satanist Boyd Rice , and the esoteric publication, Dagobert’s Revenge: Following his departure from the world of punk-rock, Vadge worked extensively with noise-music pioneer and occult researcher, Boyd Rice on the esoteric occult 'zine Dagobert's Revenge. Vadge contributed a number of articles to Dagobert's Revenge during its half-decade existence and has also provided various webzines with his occult-related work. I don’t know if Vadge Moore, who currently resides nowhere and is presently wandering the Earth, will appreciate the fact that I am inserting his old article in this book, but I find it perfectly suited to understand more about the Typhonian Tradition of the O.T.O., and how is it linked to the Merovingian Mythos, still so popular amongst the dark side of the Illuminati. Remember the words of Brion Gysin, Nothing Is True - Everything Is Permitted and here we go, or even better “Here to go” as my 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"old friend Terry Wilson titled is a tribute to Brion. Kenneth Grant and the Merovingian Mythos by Vadge Moore Our work is therefore historically authentic; the rediscovery of the Sumerian Tradition. Aleister Crowley Lincoln’s research have undoubtedly illumined certain phases of an ancient myth-cycle intimately associated with the Typhonian Current. They reveal a possible connection between a historic lineage - the Merovingian - and the Typhonian Tradition. Kenneth Grant What is the Typhonian Tradition, and how is it linked to the Merovingian/Grail Bloodline and the Priory of Sion as described in Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln and Richard Leigh’s book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail ? According to Kenneth Grant, a leading exponent of the Typhonian Tradition of the Ordo Templi Orientis, this tradition is part of a current of magical force and occult lore, dating back to Sumeria and pre-Dynastic Egypt. Originally known as the Draconian Tradition, it is a magical current “based on initiated knowledge or gnosis of the Fire Snake.” The Fire Snake is also known as the Kundalini or the Ophidian Current; the basis of all true initiation. Who is Typhon? According to Mr. Grant, Typhon is “The feminine aspect of Set; sometimes typified as the Mother of Set in her role of Goddess of the Seven Stars, of which Set is the Eighth.” Set is the brother of Osiris in the Egyptian Pantheon. Set, Osiris’ dark brother, chopped Osiris up into many pieces, leaving him for dead. Set was also the prototype for Satan. Grant writes: The word Set or Sut, means black. This indicates not only the generative nature of this god, but also his association with the night-world, Amenta, as being a god of the heavens, Set fell beneath the horizon and was recognized in later mythologies as the Lord of Hell, the Hidden Land. This god is of supreme importance in Crowley’s Cult, being not only the name of the primal creative spirit but also the formula for sexual magick . 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" FIG 7 – Left: “Typhon” (A. Kircher, Oedipus aegyptiacus) Right: “Typhon” (Le Tarot alchimique) Set was the “black god”. He was known as “he who is below.” He was banished to the underworld by his “twin” Horus for killing Osiris. The Nephilim were banished to the center of the earth for disobeying God by mating with the daughters of man and teaching them the “forbidden” arts. In this publication, the Nephilim have been identified as the Fathers of the Merovingians. Set was generally considered to be a vile, vicious god baneful to men. But there are enough aspects of this god that link him to the ancient Sumerian myths, the basis of the Merovingian mythos published in this magazine, to show that Set is to be identified with the same gods and characters that make up these Mythos. He may have been considered baneful towards some races, but not the race of the Grail. In E.A. Wallis Budge’s book The Gods of the Egyptians , Set is identified as a personification “ of the forces of the waters which were supposed to resist light and order. A number of beasts which dwelt in the water were regarded as symbols of him and of beings wherein he took up his habitation.” We will recall that the Merovingian race was sired by a water beast known as the Quinotaur. 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"This Quinotaur took the form of a sea-bull. Crowley’s personal seal was of a sea goat. Grant, writing of Crowley’s Seal of the Beast, says: “The beast is the sea-goat or amphibious monster identical with Cthulhu, the Quinotaure or Bull of the Deep.” Grant writes as a footnote; “The waters under the earth; home of the ‘ancestors’ or subconscious atavisms of the race.” Is this a reference to the race of the Grail? Grant, writing on the cross of the four corners says; “The intersection of this surface (horizontal and vertical ) represents, therefore, the gateway to another dimension, the waters beneath the earth that mirror in their uncertain depths the heights of space above the earth wherein glow the stars, the unborn or un-fleshed souls of future states of consciousness, or simply life beyond earth. The mortal world spreads east and west and the land of the invisible lies above and below it in the vertical dimensions of height and depths, north and south, Horus and Set.” This ties in with The Book of Enoch and the Hosts above and the fallen, banished Nephilim, below. This also reminds us of the twins or brother gods in Sumeria called Enki and Enlil. Enki, the infernal of the two, represents Set and Enlil represents Horus (although in this context Enlil would also be Osiris). In ancient mythologies, names and stories can be switched and one god can also be an attribute of another. It’s best to keep this in mind when studying this type of material. Set kills Osiris as Enki kills Enlil. As it has been shown in another article of this publication, Enki is associated with Cain, and Cain was a very bad boy. Enki was an infernal god that has been identified, in this publication, as siring the Merovingian race. Crowley writes, regarding his Holy Guardian Angel Aiwass, or for want of a better term, his spirit guide; “I now am inclined to believe that Aiwass is not only the God or Devil once held holy in Sumer, and mine own Holy Guardian Angel, but also a man as I am , insofar as he uses a human body to make His Magickal link with mankind...” Aiwass is the “minister” of Hoor-Paar -Kraat who is another aspect of Set. In Crowley’s Book of the Law , Aiwass puts Crowley in touch with the gods now in charge of this planet. This is significant as Crowley describes Aiwass as also manifesting as a man, not just a god. This is what we have discovered in this magazine regarding the gods of ancient Sumeria who appeared as gods, men and kings. They seem to straddle the fence of the divine and mortal worlds. Enki has been associated with Set (in Tracy Twyman’s article ‘The Merovingian Mythos: Its Symbolic Significance, and its Roots in the Ancient Kingdom of Atlantis“), who is also Satan. It is significant that Crowley identified himself as “The Great Beast 666.” In one of Grant’s 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"glossaries, we read: “Vivo: A corrupt form of OVIZ or Aiwaz, the god worshipped in ancient Sumer and identical with Set or Shaitan.” Grant, writing of the “eye of the void” of a primal African cult says: “This void was known as Elemi, a name which is said to be incommunicable. It was the equivalent of El or Al , continued in the Draconian Cults as El Shaddai or Al Shaitan, the stellar deity worshipped by the Arabs and the Jews, and by the earliest settlers in Sumer (in Sumeria the god El is also known as Ia) Alemi or Alhim became the Elohim of biblical lore. These gods or cosmic powers poured through the Veil of the Ain - the all-seeing eye - which has its human analog in the ajna chakra, concentrated in the first power zone-Kether.” The Elohim are messengers from high above, bringing “knowledge” down for mankind, similar to the Nephilim. They are also associated with Set, or the Chaldean form of Set, Shaitan. Writing of the Great Old Ones or Elder Gods from Lovecraftian lore, Grant says, “The letter M, the key vibration of the plane of the Elder Gods, is represented mythologically as the sea-goat, Makaru or as the crocodile, the beast of the waters.” Couldn’t Makaru be a form of Merovee who spawned the Merovingians, and was sired himself from a sea-bull? Tracy Twyman has already written of the connections between Lovecraft’s Necronomicon Mythos, and the Merovingians in her article ‘Dead But Dreaming: The Great Old Ones of Lovecraftian Legend Reinterpreted as Sumerian/Atlantean Kings.’ Now we come to the Qlippoth. The Qlippoth are denizens of the back side of the Tree of Life. This backside or dark side, is said to be behind the regular Sephirah of the Qabalah. They are said to be the shells or the husks of the day side of the Tree. But according to Kenneth Grant, they are actually the first, primal manifestation of all things. In terms of Lovecraftian lore, they are the Ancient Ones or Great Old Ones of the Necronomicon . They are the first primal void of Nothing before there was something. They have been considered evil by Qabalists and Occultists for centuries, only because they represent the terrible blackness of the void, and the complete destruction of what we understand as ego, which seems horrific to us. These Qlippoth reside in what is known as the Tunnels of Set. These Tunnels are behind or beneath the Day Side of the Tree of Life, as the Nephilim reside beneath the earth. As terrifying as these “beings” may seem, Grant says they are here to enlighten us, as the Nephilim were. Why is the abode of these beings called the Tunnels of Set? Grant writes; “Of Set because Set is the Seat of the powers manifest as the Tree of Life.” 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"This is what is known as the Typhonian Tradition that Kenneth Grant speaks of. Let’s review: Kenneth Grant believes that he is a part of the Typhonian Tradition or Draconian Tradition, that is concerned with the god Set who, like the Nephilim, was banished to live beneath the earth. The Nephilim are believed to have sired the Merovingian Race. Set is a god of the waters and the Merovingian race was sired by a god, the Quinotaur, that also was a beast of the waters. The denizens of the Tunnels of Set, which are behind the Tree of Life, or beneath, have been considered evil and bestial, and are known in the ancient Hebrew texts of the Qabalah as the Qlippoth. The Qliphoth, according to Grant, are actually of benefit to the initiated in order to take them to another level of initiation. Now here is the kicker: according to E.A. Wallis Budge, “Animals with red or reddish brown hair or skins were, and even red-haired men, were supposed to be especially under the influence of Set.” As is well-known to anyone reading this publication, the Merovingians were notorious for their red hair, and it was believed that this is where they received all of their powers. Crowley’s design of the Chariot card in his Tarot Deck, depicts a Knight (Templar?) holding a disk that represents the Grail. Anyone who has read The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail would know that the Templars were Knights pledged to defend the Merovingian/Grail Bloodline. Grant says, in a footnote; “It should be noted that the Graal-Bearer [represented on the Tarot card] is depicted in amber-colored armor [amber or red, the color associated with the Merovingians]. Amber or Orange appears repeatedly in accounts of UFO sightings.” Crowley, in his Book of Thoth , writes; “The Charioteer is clothed in the amber-colored armor appropriate to the sign. He is throned in the chariot rather than conducting it because the whole system of progression is perfectly balanced. His only function is to bear the Holy Grail.” Grant writes, “The bearer of the Graal [Knights Templar?] depicted on Atu VII [the Tarot card] may, therefore, be identified with the bringer to earth of the Sangraal, or blood royal, the blood which flows in the veins of the Kingly Man extolled by Crowley, although not understood by him in the sense of trans-human Intelligence. Crowley’s design for the Graal resembles as closely as may be, for a pre- 1947 representation, a shape frequently described in connection with particular types of UFO.” Pre-1947 because, as Grant says, that year was the modern explosion of accounts of UFO “sightings” around the world. I 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"am not partial to the literal belief in UFO’s. I believe, as Dr. Carl Jung believed, that these UFO sightings are a product of our unconscious veiling of an ancient human experience. Enough said. This “bringing to earth” of the Sangraal by UFO’s is the modern day equivalent of the Nephilim, the Outer Ones, or the Elohim earthling “knowledge” and siring a new race of “kingly” beings for this world. Kingly i.e., the Merovingians. The Merovingian blood is the blood of kings, the kings or gods from ancient Sumeria and beyond. The Plantard family crest is regarded as the key to the Typhonian/Draconian Current, which is the demonic lineage of the Merovingian bloodline. The Typhonian Current refers to the Dragon lineage of Satan. In his book Outer Gateways Kenneth Grant writes: “ In The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail, the authors reproduce the family crest of Clan Plantard, the contemporary representative of which was, until recently, the Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion, an Order which, according to Lincoln, dominated the Order of the Knights Templar and various other highly influential institutions which, at certain periods of history, included the Vatican. The crest which supplies the key to the Current represented by the Merovingian bloodline and the Order of Sion comprises the symbols of the Typhonian line of descent: the two bears, eleven bees, and the fleur de lys. The motto incorporated in the crest reads ‘Et in Arcadia ego.’ Arcadia=127, which is the number of the Egyptian Goddess Heqt who was typified by the ‘lower part of the back, or haunch.’ The two bears denote the Mother (Typhon) and her son (Set). The image of the bee pictures the buzzing or humming vibration peculiar to the Outer Ones, or their vehicles. Eleven is the number of Those who are Without, or beyond, the Tree of Life, thus identifying the Outer Ones.” The Outer Ones are also the Qlippoth or the Ancient Ones of Lovecraftian lore. The fact that the Typhonian Tradition and the Merovingian Tradition share the same important symbols seems to be much more than a mere coincidence . In the Typhonian Tradition, the Bear is the constellation of Ursa Major. The stars must be aligned in a specific way in order for Set to be properly invoked. To the Priory of Sion (the secret, occult organization dedicated to preserving the Merovingian Bloodline), the Bear was an animal of the Goddess Diana. According to Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince, the authors 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"of The Templar Revelation , ...the Merovingian kings, from their founder Merovee to Clovis (who converted to Christianity in 496) were ‘pagan kings of the cult of Diana’. Picknett and Prince got this information from the Dossiers Secrets of the Priory of Sion. The bees, which are a recurring symbol of the Merovingians are, in the Typhonian Tradition, represented frequently as the humming or buzzing sound that occurs before the appearance of the Great Old Ones or “beings” proper to this tradition. Grant writes “The bee, beetle, or crab, is therefore the link between the earliest manifestation of the Typhonion current and its final phases.” Also; “217 is the key number of [Crowley’s] The Book of the Law . 217 is also the number of DBVRH, meaning ‘a bee’ which is the specific symbol of Sekhet, whose name means ‘a bee.’ Sekhet is another aspect of the god Set. There are eleven bees because eleven is the number of Magick and of the Sephirah on the Tree of Life, called Daath, which is the “Gateway” to the backside of the Tree and to the Gods. Kenneth Grant’s wife Steffi Grant illustrated the cover of her husband’s book Beyond the Mauve Zone, with an image of two bees holding a crystal. As for the fleur-de-lys, in the Typhonian Tradition it represents the ‘kingly man’ that Crowley extols, and the inheritor of the Grail Bloodline. In The Vision and the Voice , Crowley is “conversing” with his Holy Guardian Angel Aiwass, who says: “For I am not appointed to guard thee, but we are of the blood royal, the guardians of the Treasure-house of Wisdom”: the “blood royal,” the Sangraal of the Holy Grail. Throughout all of Kenneth Grant’s books there are references to ideas, archetypes, and images related to the Sumerians, the Merovingians and especially to the mythos that Tracy Twyman has uncovered in this publication. There are references that I haven’t even mentioned. For instance, the bat wings discovered at Rennes le Chateau that in the Typhonian Tradition represent the inversion of the senses that lead to enlightenment and occult knowledge. I agree with Grant that Henry Lincoln’s research has “illumined certain phases of an ancient myth-cycle intimately associated with the Typhonian Current.” It seems that the farther down this road we go, the closer we get to the truth.

It was this that inspired the Tantric sects of India, and Grant intimates that the ultimate 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"origin of all this lies with a matriarchal pre-Dynastic culture in Africa. Now, considering that next to nothing is known about the historical origins of Tantra, (scholars can’t even determine if Hindu or Buddhist texts are older), Grant’s assertions are about as good as anyone’s. Unfortunately, he offers no real support; we are apparently required to accept it as the Gospel Utterance of an Initiated Teacher. The book can certainly not be called scholarly; Grant rarely identifies his sources, even for direct quotes, and when he does, it is often not helpful. He refers often to an unpublished “Initiated Tantric Comment” as substantiating his theories (which mostly seem to deal with the Magical virtues of vaginal secretions,) but we are given no idea as to its authorship or authority. One long quote, referring as it does to modern Western medical practices, makes it clear that this “Comment ” is of recent composition, but I see no reason to regard it as more than a reasonably valid interpretation of Tantric ritual. Grant claims it is the One-True-Received-From-On-High doctrine, which sounds like classic B.S.-to-the-third-power, to me. As near as I can figure, Grant takes most of his archaeology from 19th-century sources, some of which were not taken seriously even then. In his search for support, he even treats as legitimate sources, the works of “Inquire Within , ” a notorious conspiracy theorist and occult-basher of the 1920s! Grant’s theology is rather odd: he identifies the God Set with Hoor-Paar- Kraat and with Aiwass. We are also given to understand that the star Sirius is the source of the Thelemic Current. At one point he tries to connect Thelema with the fiction of the New England horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. Now, as HPL did base most of his works on his dreams, there is a case for “occult inspiratio n ”, but the table Grant produces is so superficial and unconvincing as to make one wonder just how familiar he is with either man’s work. There is not a lot of Qabalah in this book (in his later work, the alphabet-soup can take up whole chapters,) but there is one real zinger: “Twenty-six (twice thirteen), is the number of Achad Unity. ” To be fair, this is probably a typo, and it is corrected in the errata sheet of the Skoob edition (but you would think that for a 35-dollar reprint they could afford to correct the actual text, but nooo. . .) In the later chapter Grant concentrates more on the work of modern Magicians: mostly Crowley of course, but also Frater Achad, Jack Parsons, Dion Fortune and Austin Osman Spare. This is where the book is really useful as Grant actually knew most of them. He was Crowley’s secretary in 1944-5 e.v. And his friendship with Spare covered the last decade of the 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"artist-shaman’s life. Grant is Spare’s executor and is largely responsible for reviving interest in his work, an achievement not to be sneered at. The two chapters on Spare are perhaps the best in the book. In fact, Grant often seems to have a better understanding of Spare’s system than of Crowley’s, notwithstanding that he claims to be the latter’s successor. Frater ZAX of Pyramid Lodge, once remarked that Grant’s virtue was that he is almost the only biographer of Crowley who focused on the man’s Magick, rather than on his unorthodox lifestyle. This may be so, but Grant’s interpretations seem to miss more often than they hit, and in style, he often reminds one more of A.E. Waite! Most of Crowley’s remarks about Waite in the Equinox could just as easily be aimed at Grant. There is even the extensive vocabulary with words such as “praeter-human,” “transmundane, “enchiridion, ” “subserved, ” “openly-unavowed representatives” (a typo?), “efflux,” “objurgations,” “discreted,” “clepsydral horologue” (my personal favorite,) and “reification” (Grant’s favorite.) The list could go on, and will, as we consider his other books. In his Introduction, Grant declares that he has \"introduced no blinds, no deliberately misleading statements, or vague allusions to formulae that cannot be shown to be as precise in their action and reaction as their analogues in the more orthodox sciences.\" If you think this is ironic in view of my comments here, please be assured that you have seen nothing yet! Our subject has not yet begun to perplex. [15] O rgasmic secrets of the Illuminati Central to the works of Grant, and the contemporary wizards of the Western Intiatic System is the practice of sexuality, viewed obviously in a magical perspective.

This is one of the key beliefs of the Illuminati network that in this day and age has Drunvalo Melchizedek as one of its key New Age figures, and modern representatives. His website states: “According to Drunvalo he is the spirit assigned from the Galactic Center to be with the humanity from the very moment it was created. Naturally, there are 2 fractions (types of consciousness) opposed to each other in every way imaginable – the good one is called ‘The Great 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"White Brotherhood’ (from which is Machiavinda), the bad one is called ‘The Great Dark Brotherhood’ – the former is evolution (positive, progressive), the latter is devolution (negative, regressive). These two forces tend to balance each other out to allow changes to take place at the perfect time (neither too soon or too late). Our current world is 3D (3rd dimension, space and time, polarity consciousness), but viewed from a higher level (4th+ dimension) all “good and bad guys” form a unity consciousness – merely different aspects of the One Creator working in harmony. That’s why in our polarity world ‘good’ and ‘evil’ are mere lessons . [16] Drunvalo writes in an online magazine inspired by his writings, called the Spirit of Ma'at : A chakra is an energy vortex connected to the entire human energy field, and the Universal Heart Chakra is the fifth of thirteen chakras. (There is also a system of eight chakras; in that system, the heart chakra is number four.) The Egyptian system held that the orgasm was intimately connected to this fifth, or Universal Heart Chakra. First, I will explain the connection to eternal life. Most people in the world are ignorant about what happens to their sexual energy after they have an orgasm. Usually, the energy moves up the spine and out the top of the head directly into the eighth or thirteenth chakra (same chakra, different system). In a few rare cases, the sexual energy is released down the spine into the hidden centre below the feet, the point opposite the one above the head. In either case, the sexual energy — the concentrated life-force energy called prana in Hinduism — is dissipated and lost. It is similar to discharging a battery into a ground wire. It is no longer in the battery and so it is gone forever. This is what all the world’s Tantric systems that I am aware of believe, that orgasm brings one a little closer to death because a person loses his or her life-force energy in the orgasm, and is made weaker. But the Egyptians found long ago that it does not have to be this way. It is for this reason, that the Hindu and Tibetan Tantra systems ask the male to avoid ejaculating. Instead, they speak of these tiny invisible tubes where, when a student learns to control the orgasm and the flow of their sexual energy, the sperm migrates up to the higher centres. Both of these systems, and also the Chinese Taoist Tantra system, are all primarily concerned with the sexual energy flow, sometimes referred to as ‘sexual currents’. They 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"are primarily concerned with what happens as the sexual energy is moved before the orgasm, but they have entirely different views of this energy compared to the Egyptians. The Egyptians believed that orgasm is healthy and necessary, including the release of sperm in males, but that the sexual energy currents must be controlled in a deeply esoteric procedure that is unlike any other system. They believed that if this energy is controlled, the human orgasm becomes a source of infinite pranic energy that is not lost. They believe that the entire Mer-Ka-Ba or Lightbody (the field of energy surrounding and interpenetrating the body) benefits from this sexual release. They even believe that under the right conditions the orgasm will directly lead to eternal life and that the ankh is the key. The Egyptian Ankh symbolizes eternal life and eternal life is linked to the breath. The Ankh is also linked to sexual energy. How was ‘ankhing’ used to enhance consciousness and promote immortality? Essentially, one would use their awareness to move second chakra energy released during orgasm and manipulate it. Normally, this energy moves up the spine, through the top of the head, into the eighth chakra (above the physical body), and disperses outward. The ankhing technique allowed one to harness this energy at the fifth chakra and send it back down into the body where it would stay and revitalize touched energy centres. The Spirit of Ma’at has an eight-step process describing the how-tos of ankhing that is very clear: 1. The moment you feel the sexual energy about to rise up your spine, take a very deep breath, filling your lungs about 9/10th full, then hold your breath. 2. Allow the sexual energy of the orgasm to come up your spine. But at the moment it reaches the fifth chakra (located just a couple of finger-widths above the sternum), with your willpower you must turn the flow of sexual energy 90 degrees out the back of the body. It will then automatically continue inside the ankh tube. It will slowly turn until it passes exactly through the eighth (or thirteenth) chakra, one hand-length above the head at 90 degrees to the vertical. It will then continue to curve around until it returns to the fifth chakra, where it began, only this time in the front of the body. Even if you don’t understand what was just said, it will happen automatically if you get it started out the back of the body at the fifth chakra, and it will automatically come back around to the front of the body and reconnect at the fifth chakra. You just have to make it turn 90 degrees so that it begins. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"3. It will often slow down as it approaches its point of origin, the fifth chakra. If you can see the energy, it comes to a sharp point. When it approaches the fifth chakra from the front of the body, there is sometimes a tremendous jolt as it reconnects with this chakra again. All this takes place while you are holding your first breath. 4. The instant the sexual energy reconnects with its source, the fifth chakra, take in the full breath. You had filled your lungs only 9/10th full, so now you fill your lungs as completely as you can. 5. Now exhale very, very slowly. The sexual energy will continue on around the ankh channel as long as you are exhaling. When you reach the bottom of this breath, you will continue to breathe very deeply, but a change happens here. 6. It is here that, if you know the Lightbody work of the Mer-Ka-Ba, you would begin to breathe from the two poles using Mer-Ka-Ba breathing. But if you are like most people and don’t know this work, then continue to breathe deeply until you feel the relaxation begin to spread throughout your body. Then relax your breath at your normal rate. Feel every cell becoming rejuvenated by this life-force energy. Let this energy reach down into the deepest physical levels of your body structure even past the cellular level. Feel how this beautiful energy surrounds your very being and brings health to your body, mind, and heart. 7. Once the relaxation begins, slow your breath down to a normal shallow breathing. 8. If possible, allow yourself to completely relax or even sleep for a while afterward.” [17] Ok, so now we have a good inside view of Drunvalo’s philosophy, and his connection to Ma’at, or Maat, the familiar Egyptian form of the goddess of Justice. Let’s understand who this figure is for those who think she is the characterization of the fourth Aeon. It was the Aeon of Maat or “ MA- ION” that Crowley's student Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones) later came to advocate as prematurely succeeding that of Horus. Why did he do that? Kenneth Grant and his Illuminati school later confused the issue even further, by suggesting that Maat was the “daughter” complement of Horus, the son, promoting the idea of a sort of “double current” in the Illuminati, in which those two god-forms were coeval. Probably the most interesting and consequential outgrowth of this premise has been the Maatian magick of Nema, a very influential occultist, and writer, best known for her magical writings about the Ma'atian current. Nema went on writing her 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"own inspired scripture, called Liber Pennae Penumbra . A work she allegedly channeled in 1974, fifty years after Crowley’s channeled The Book of the Law , and from it, she created an independent body of magical techniques with her own ideas being featured prominently in the writings of the great “Illuminati guru” Kenneth Grant. In 1979, she co-founded the Horus-Maat Lodge . According to Donald Michael Kraig in Review of Maat Magick : Nema has been one of the most influential occultists of the last quarter century although most occultists have never read her works. What Nema has done is influence those who have been writers and teachers. They, in turn, influenced the rest of us. The late Kenneth Grant also proposed three prehistorical Aeons, of the Void, of Chaos, and of the Earth, which would have preceded that of Isis. Nema, writing in The Cincinnati Journal of Ceremonial Magick (No. VII) telescoped these three into the “Nameless Aeon,” characterized by the Egyptian god Bes. In addition, she added a “Wordless Aeon” to succeed the double Aeon of Horus and Maat, so that Harpocrates as silence would complete the cycle. Thus, the full sequence proposed by Nema is Bes – Isis – Osiris – Horus – Maat – Harpocrates .

However, Linda Falorio a disciple of Grant, described by him in a personal communication as “a high- priestess of Typhon, and a methodical one at that!” As synthesized in the words “Take what they give”, use all the techniques of the Illuminati, to encounter oneself in this new Aeonic succession. Falorio, who is well- known in contemporary Illuminati magickal circles, worked with her Magickal partner, Fred Fowler, in reifying paintings of all of the 22 Tunnels of Set, as described by Aleister Crowley in LIBER 231, and later by Kenneth Grant in Nightside of Eden. All this seems to secretly inspire, and guide, people like Drunvalo Melchizedek, who is a Consciousness “celebrity” second to none in the New Age world. 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" FIG 10 – Drunvalo Melchizedek (Bernard Perona, born 1941) 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"FIG 11 – Thelemic author and Tantrick expert Linda Falorio Linda Falorio : In each encounter in your daily life, take whatever the other gives you.

And now let’s go over the main points of this fascinating subject analyzed by occultist and Illuminati expert Linda Falorio: “Dissolve ego-boundaries via the moment of the kiss. In that ineffable moment, the boundaries between oneself and the other blur. Prolong this moment until you feel an energy and awareness other than \"yourself\" move through you. Kiss a plant. Kiss an inanimate object, such as a stone, a car, a pencil, your athamé. Kiss an animal. Kiss another human being. In so doing, you will for that moment of the kiss, merge your interior essences and learn something of the being of the other. Be warned that the other in turn will have taken away a part of you as well. The mirror: trading places. Using your imagination, stare into the eyes of another person until you have “become” that person, looking back at yourself who has thus become \"the other\". This can be very intense, even unsettling for both parties. When successful there is a flash of union with the other that is a flow of pure universal love, a reaching out and identification with them, as all love is union with that which we desire, that which we would absorb into ourselves. For the adventurous: try this with someone you don't like or someone with whom you are angry. Mirror, mirror. Gaze at your reflection in a mirror until it is no longer familiar to you until the face has become that of the other gazing back. Radiate kindness to that other in the mirror, give it your acceptance, let your love flow out to it and then return as it is again reflected back to you. Magickal Monogamy. When we seek the muse of inspiration via union with the other, we encounter this difficulty: the muse lies within us, not the other. No individual can, therefore, give us what we do not already possess within ourselves. Though, we may find in that first thrill of a new lover the spark which ignites the elusive inspiration which we seek—at least temporarily. 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Yet, if one persists in Tantric practice with one given individual, there is a deepening of power as masks are shed. Rather than becoming familiar and boring, there is a point at which the lover becomes totally mysterious, totally OTHER — and thus a transcendent channel of creative magickal force. ORGASM MAGICKS: Orgasm is energy.Voluntary rhythmic movements of body and breath build energy patterns, inducing deep primal responses in body and psyche. At the moment of orgasm, the sense of personal \"I\" enlarges its boundaries, merging with the lifestream of the universe, the mind, and body aglow with a thousand pinpricks of dancing energy and light. Orgasm creates a gate to other dimensions. Where the ordinary person merely loses consciousness of self, falling happily asleep, the Tantric adept rides the stream of orgasmic discharge into astral worlds, where s/he accesses creative realities where the power to will a thing is enough to make it so. Breathing Orgasm. In your temple or shrine room, establish a breathing rhythm. Visualize the life force around you as brilliant dancing points of light. Breathe this light into your body; allow yourself to experience the surrounding ocean of vibrating energy in which we constantly swim, and from which we derive our being. As the breathing rhythm becomes established, you will move deeper and deeper into a meditative state; your consciousness will calm, becoming lucid and clear. Experiment with each of the following practices until distinct physical sensations come through: Imagine that you are breathing in and out not through your nose or mouth, but through the bones of your legs, breathe through the bones of your arms. Breathe through the top of your skull, continuing until your mind expands, opening to the universe. Breathe through the pores of your skin, until your body feels cleansed, entirely alive and open to sensation. Breathe energy up from the base of your spine to the top of your skull. Breathe energy back down from your head to the base of your spine, your body becoming charged with energy and light as you breathe the energy current up and down your spine. Breathe energy up and out through the top of your head, then down and around your body, appearing as the brilliant blue of your protective aura, growing into the bright blue of the circle that encloses you within your sacred space, a circle that becomes brighter, more vital with each breath. Breathe through the seven vital 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"centers of the chakras each, in turn, awakening them to vibrate with living light. Body Orgasm: A Tree of Night Tantra.

Experience the blessing of Hir all-embracing love as a profound opening of the heart into stillness, silence, peace.” [19] This is simply a possibility to understand further the various components of the Western Initiatic System, and what we define as the Illuminati. Let’s also remember that Grant's images of the Great Old Ones mentioned by Linda Falorio at the end of this short “orgasmic essay”, closely resemble the traditional big-headed, tiny-bodied aliens envisioned by Hollywood producers. However, the Great Old Ones first appear as a fictional species 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"created by H. P. Lovecraft, which made their first appearance in the 1936 novel, At the Mountains of Madness . Additional references to the so-called “Old Ones“ appear in Lovecraft's short stories The Dreams in the Witch- House (written after Mountains, but published beforehand in 1933) and The Shadow Out of Time. As David Livingstone writes in his interesting expose, Transhumanism: The History of a Dangerous Idea : The Great Old Ones formed a cult in dark places all over the world, until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R’lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Someday he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him. At the time, according to Lovecraft, in his diabolical pessimism:...free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the Earth would scream with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Lovecraft derived his notion of extra- terrestrial visitors from his reading of both George Fort’s The Book of the Damned and Scott-Elliott’s compilation volume The Story of Atlantis and Lost Lemuria (1925). [20] For Livingstone, although Lovecraft referred to Theosophical material as “crap,” he “drew inspiration from The Book of Dzyan , which formed the basis of Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine , in developing the Cthulhu Mythos’ own account of pre-human or occult texts. Blavatsky claimed to have discovered The Book of Dzyan , written in the language of Senzar in Tibet, whereas Livingstone tells us in his book, it was guarded by an Occult Brotherhood. Lovecraft declared that the Great Old Ones “antedate the earth,” in The Diary of Alonzo Typer , in which he transformed Theosophy’s Venusians into aliens who flew across the solar system in spaceships to “civilize” planet Earth. Lovecraft’s The Great Old Ones equate with The Great Old Ones of the Night Time, a phrase which occurs in rituals of the Golden Dawn. Colin Low has suggested that Lovecraft’s wife, Sonia Greene, had had an affair with Aleister Crowley months before she met Lovecraft , to whom she revealed the idea of the Necronomicon, which she would have learned from Crowley. [21] Livingstone states that: “The Necronomicon is a fictional 1,200 year old 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"grimoire mentioned in Lovecraft’s stories. It was supposedly written by the “Mad Arab” called Abdul Alhazrad, who worshipped the Lovecraftian entities Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu. Alhazred was born in Yemen, a country with historically a strong Jewish and Kabbalistic community. Alhazred is said to have visited the ruins of Babylon, the “subterranean secrets” of Memphis, and discovered the “nameless city” below Irem in the Empty Quarter of Arabia, living his last years in Damascus, before his death in 738 AD. Necronomicon was translated into Greek and Latin, and despite attempts at its suppression, was finally acquired by John Dee. According to The History of the Necronomicon, the very act of studying the text is inherently dangerous, as those who attempt to master its arcane knowledge generally meet terrible ends. Crowley’s disciple Kenneth Grant, suggested in his book The Magical Revival (1972) that there was an unconscious connection between Crowley and Lovecraft. He thought they both drew on the same occult forces—Crowley through magic and Lovecraft through the dreams which inspired his stories and the Necronomicon. Grant claimed that the Necronomicon existed as an astral book as part of the Akashic records and could be accessed through ritual magic or in dreams.” [22] N ow let’s move on to analyze the possibility of contact with extradimensional entities through sexual magick. There are a number of ways the seeker in the Illuminati can attain and maintain contact with entities in other dimensions, realms, and planes of existence; and such secrets are usually the most difficult to obtain for the uninitiated. Illuminati secret cultivation and trafficking with Yidams Through the aids of sexual magic and shamanism, we find two efficient portals where the Illuminati sorcerers operate. Sexual magic should be considered more as a technique, than a procedure belonging to tantrism, since sexual magic is found within the mysteries of the gnostics, paganist circles, among the devotees of the true catholic church and a multitude of other branches of knowledge. Through the work of Theodor Reuss and Aleister Crowley in the West, the use of sexual techniques in the Great Work has received a somewhat dubious reputation, much due to the very tone of language the lectures in the VIII°, IX° and XI° degrees of the Ordo Templi Orientis which were put into writing by Baphomet and circulated 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"amongst the handful of high initiated in this order and made public by Francis X. King in the 1973 publication of The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O. In these lectures the gnostic and old-Christian mode for use of sexual substances and the energy evoked through it are presented, but little differs from the actual aim and technique used among the saddhus and other Tantrik initiated in the more than two-thousand years before the coming of the Christ in his form as Jeshua ben Joseff, who is said by the Illuminati to be a follower of such practices. The sexual magic herein presented is mainly focused on how a certain Master Azoth , a high-level representative in today’s Illuminati circles, interprets the work of the O.T.O. XI° degree. In the Order of the Oriental Templars, this degree was deemed to use for the homosexual current in nature. For Master Azoth, a past disciple of Michael Bertiaux, Kenneth Grant, and other luminaries of sexual magick, this is not totally correct. All forms of intercourse in the flesh, between any sexes, is considered an IX° degree working. When you turn the degree from 9 into 11, it becomes one more than the number of divine points and brings the whole act one degree higher. Just as an act of sexual magic between two humans will result in the procreation of the One – completing the perfection. One over is an abomination since it captures the idea of fornicating with spirits. This is considered dangerous, due to the likely experiences of succubi and incubi-phenomena and not to mention the danger of vampirism. Still, this is an important aspect in this work undertaken by the darkest side of the Illuminati where Master Azoth, known to the profane world as Nicholaj de Mattos Frisvold , a native of Norway and resident of Brazil since 2003, still operates . [23] The work of the IX° is a procreative work, the XI° is not. In use, it resembles the auto-erotic techniques of the VIII°, namely magical masturbation, but in this context, the mass is put in reverse motion and quite surprising results could occur. The Illuminati, when working in this field of magick choose two symbolic weapons; the trident and the vajra. The trident is a protective symbol, but it is a lot more than that. It is the very fire of the soul, spirit and the body combined, as it is leaping forth from the flames of fornication. The vajra is supposed to be our defensive shield, the lustral fire that is connected to the divine braze and the breath of the thunder as it is seen amongst the eyes and wings of godhood. One of the forms of sexual magic that Master Azoth taught in the late 90’s 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"and early 2000s in his own Illuminati lodges and defined as the “Supreme Occult Agency of Change”, is a technique widely worked in various Illuminati orders under a multitude of names. Whether the name it is familiar to you, we will in this lesson work it according to the theory of Master Azoth’s definition of the secrets of XI°. The technique itself is fairly easy since it is based upon internal manipulation of a god-form that can be projected, thus becoming an external form and therefore is the base for the succubi and incubi phenomena. This state is recognized by its highly intoxicated state of divine overflowing and can result in the Illuminati seeker becoming the oracle and further, it can lead to an unhealthy obsession. First, the Illuminati occult seeker should invoke the god-form desired. Sit, stand or position yourself in a form of Asana that resembles the deity. At this stage, you should use any bodily possibility, limbs, and facial movements – whatever to assume the god-form. Vibrate the name of the deity in a slow, rhythmic manner. Try to pronounce the name with both the inward breathing and the exhalation. At the same time, have a fixed image of the deity in your mind’s eye. For each exhalation imagine that the deity grows larger and larger and its luminosity and complexity becomes more and more vivid. When the image begins to fill you completely, for Master Azoth at this point you should start to masturbate. Ok, don’t be shocked, remember, this is the Illuminati, not the Boy Scouts. When climaxing the Illuminati seeker visualizes the orgasmic flood turning inwards, meaning inside him, and exploding rapidly through his being that has developed this orgasmic energy that can’t be wasted. The seeker allows this rush to give the demon/deity life inside of his body, basically facilitating the willing possession and manipulation by a demon, offering his mind to the invoked extradimensional being, or deity, as the Illuminati like to call them. He explores the raised forcefield and uses this force to allow the entity to use his own flesh as he desires. The field raised by giving life to an invoked being in this manner has proven to be an extremely highly charged environment for occult inspiration, so the practitioner willingly uses the magnetism manifesting in this field. The effect will disintegrate after 20-30 minutes and the internal manipulation eventually will begin to fade. However, if the seeker still feels awkward or ruled by this 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"interdimensional alien being two hours after the ritual is over, Master Azoth teaches in his secret writings to go to sleep for a short period of time or perform a banishing. Banishing spells are spells made to prevent these beings from returning inside you. When this technique is mastered the Illuminati seeker, instead of building, “the deity within” performs the act of Externalizing, that is to project the image given life and subtlety in the inner to assume a form in the outer. This is simply done by projecting the image of the invoked deity out from the ajna-chakra at the first seconds of orgasm. Ajna or third-eye chakra , is, by the way, the sixth primary chakra in the body according to Hindu tradition also known as the inner eye a mystical and esoteric concept referring to a speculative invisible eye which can provide perception beyond ordinary sight. Master Azoth writes in his notes: “Keep your eyes closed as this happens and keep focused that the being has been projected outwards and will now appear in front of you in the form you have invoked it into. As this belief is firm in your mind, open your eyes slowly and notice your surroundings and all its oddity. Further exploration in this field can be performed by using masks and the assumption of animal-forms.” Animal-forms are an important aspect of the magical training of the Illuminati and especially within the arcana of Bön, a Tibetan religion popular amongst the dark side of the Illuminati, which self-identifies as distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, where shamanistic elements are evident. The word Bön itself means ”Invocation”. In the 7th Century, Buddhism arrived in Tibet and tried to discredit Bon practices. But in the end, they merged and to some extent influenced each other. Followers of Bön are called Bonpo. I am lucky enough to have been given as a gift many years ago in Moscow an old mask of the ancient Bon animist bird spirit, Khyung that can be used for the procedure of raising the animal consciousness within. This is pretty much the same as when you work with gods and goddesses in other occult traditions working sexual magick. But this can also be done without using the orgasm as such. Master Azoth taught me that in the first stages it might be a better idea to take on the animal-form chosen by firstly reading a bit about the habits of the chosen animal and its special features and characteristics. When the Bonpo Illuminati assumes the animal form he places himself in his temple and slowly builds up the consciousness that he is now this or that animal, allowing the human side of himself to fade out into naught. He uses whatever help he can obtain to attain this state. 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Sounds, walking around on the ground using his hands, masks, fur, whatever he feels is appropriate to enter the part. And there is absolutely no reason for him to feel stupid performing this procedure as for the Illuminati imitation will eventually bring you to realization.... There are also sexual procedures to use within this arcana of animal and insectoid forms that serves for so-called “qlipphotic workings”. Remember, however, that alien qlippothic forces are by definition, and by method, of vampiric evocation that requires life force or energy to manifest in our dimension, and they often require the blood or the semen of the magician himself during the operation to fully manifest. When the animal-form is successfully achieved the Illuminati seeker will apply the traditional visualization of a deserted landscape with trees and sand where he or she will find a secret passage to the underworld. Passing down into the Underworld the Illuminati seeker must have a clear reason for doing such. If you take on the form of, for instance, a fox to transgress to the lower realms, you must have a purpose with your journey. Master Azoth once told me that you need to declare this intention at the beginning of this ritual. For example, the search for a guide, a deity, oracular rites, healing- formulas, power objects whatever. But you should always have a reason for doing this. So remember, there is a secret method used by the occult and the darkest side of the Illuminati that includes the assumption of animal-forms that are beings also given sexual food for the sake of fornication with the gods in the shape of an animal. Confused? Well, this practice is extremely dangerous and will bring forth dangerous mutant-weregods to the idiots who try it without being prepared . If such methods are applied, the Illuminati seeker should have a very good reason for doing such unless he or she will have constructed an extradimensional being on the astral that will evolve rapidly efficient skills for vampirism and unhealthy intoxication of the Illuminati seeker’s nervous system and mental layers. The succubi/incubi effect in the externalization of the god-form should be sufficient. Further, when this procedure is mastered to such a degree that you know that the deity is there you can perform different sexual acts with the entity. But for the Illuminati, the important point is apparently the consumption of the elixir that the extradimensional being produce in this joining of man and alien god, which is a very potent eucharist indeed. 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The last stage in this formulae is achieved when the deity is clearly (by sight or notion) skin to skin with the Illuminati seeker and the orgasm is produced from the point of the yab-yum position with the deity, that as we know represents the primordial union of wisdom and compassion, and is usually depicted as a male deity in union with his female consort. For the Master Azoth in this position, one should seek to join linga-yoni-wise but remember that all these gods addressed by the Illuminati are also androgynous in nature. There is also another aspect of the tantrik shamanism of Bön that is worked by the Illuminati during their occult training. That is the cultivation of the dream state. This is perhaps a safer ally to work within, on the other hand, maybe not. We will explore shortly how we can cultivate trafficking abilities within the dream state and also explore the technique known as Karezza , which has proved enormously efficient and enormously obsessive for some Illuminati groups like The Esoteric Fraternity , known initially as Genii of Nations, Knowledge, and Religions or G.N.K.R., and later as Order of Melchizidek, that I will investigate further in The Invisible Master. Karezza is an old tantrik technique adopted by many practitioners of the western occult mysteries for producing vividity of external visualization and obtaining contact with God. Again, we speak about a pretty simple technique which produces the most infernal results. Karezza was formally introduced to the West by the adept Thomas Lake Harris, and the procedure consists of performing masturbation focused upon a chosen sigil, form or image without allowing the masturbation to climax into orgasm. You build the electric tension over and over again, continually focusing upon the sigil or form, allowing this sexual exhaustion to end in sleep. This will bring forth a most peculiar process where the building up of the magnetic radioactivity will seek its fulfillment in the Dream state. Through this Illuminati technique, you will have applied a tremendous invocation of the desired force that will hunt you down in the dreamlands so beware of trying this out. Because in this state the desired form will be drawn to the massive electrical forcefield built up around the astral of the Illuminati seeker and due to the law of esoteric magnetism it will seek congress with you. For the success in producing an occult coitus with this form, the sigil of concentration must be imprinted on the being when it comes down upon you; if not, this procedure will not produce any desirable occult results. Pay attention that this formulae is very close to the true mechanisms of 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"fornication with succubi and incubi and should be proceeded with great care. I.e. you should be absolutely sure about why you are performing this ritual! Also important to mention, some people have a naturally higher level of natural sexual electricity and are more prone for instant encounters with these beings, thus able to bring them forth into mental and physical planes faster. This is especially true for those who have a heavy water nature, and exploiting fiery nature. Let us take a look at two separate cases to illustrate the potency, beneficial aspect and the dangerous aspect of these kinds of workings. Due to Bhakti-yoga, the Master Azoth incorporated Karezza to bring a deity closer to his ontological sphere. This initially resulted in an obsession for Master Azoth, but eventually turned into what he described as “very desirable results.” After approximately 40 days of traditional bhakta-yoga, Karezza was introduced by forming a sigil of the deity’s name. After one night nothing happened, except for a horrible awakening where Azoth felt drained of all energy. Dizziness and small convulsions followed during the day. The bhakta-procedures were still followed – four times this day. Upon going to bed, he again performed Karezza. This time something happened. The image of a past lover of his appeared in the dream and they had coitus. Upon awakening, Azoth felt weird and still, the dizziness continued. He realized that the fault he had committed was not to hold the sigil firm in mind upon sleeping and neither had he resumed the sigil when the form of this past lover appeared. This day he again performed the bhakta- sequences four times, but the 1st and 2nd were VIII-degree workings, in an attempt to attract the deity through a firmly radioactive sphere. Upon going to bed, he decided to sleep in the temple, again performing Karezza until sleep carried him away. This night, the past lover came again, but this time the sigil was kept vivid, also in this state so he burned the sigil in the brow and between the breasts of this form whereupon she shed her skin and appeared as a fierce, beautiful black female. They fornicated, while Azoth focused on imprinting the sigil all over her body – and especially into her eyes. Upon awakening, his belly was covered with semen and the sheet he had brought into the temple was thrown into a corner of the room. Soft spots on his body – like invisible bruises could be felt in the groin and all around the chest. Anahata-chakra and Svadhisthana-chakra were clearly infected by something. Later on that day he experienced a violent obsessive, energized flow of energy and his breathing followed strange patterns, indicating that 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Visuddha and Ajna-chakra were set into play. The Karezza-procedure continued for another week with quite similar results until Azoth deemed it unhealthy to carry on any longer, due to the heavy influx of obsessive elements in his character and life. It took time before the solidity of the encounters at night disintegrated, but he was left with an immensely important spiritual guide, that has guided his evil path ever since... There is another story about a very potent Illuminati sorceress known to Master Azoth. A natural born witch with high sexual radioactivity. A Leo- woman with moon in Cancer. She performed Karezza once and received immediate results of a dangerous nature. Firstly, she did not have a clear idea of what or why she wanted to call forth something. Secondly, she had no sigil for her intention or for the being. She simply made herself ready for rape by whatever may come around. What happened was that she woke up during the night in a violent way feeling that she had something inside of her. When opening her eyes, she immediately noticed the shadow of a beast on the wall – on top of her! She became scared and started to scream only to receive flashes of a gleaming demon fucking her to pieces. She fainted in agony awoke later that night telling herself that this was an evil dream. But the blood traces from her yoni and the odd marks on her shoulders and breasts told another story. You might think that these encounters are too fantastic to be real, but these are first-hand encounters that were written down by Master Azoth and given to me during my time in Oslo (Norway) for verification and study. The Leo-woman was Master Azoth’s assistant for a short period of time when they worked with quite dark sexual magic. Needless to say, she turned her back to magic due to this encounter. She also indulged in self-destructive sexual behavior for an extended period of time. This example illustrates several important matters, but most of all it tells that this procedure is a risky endeavor, even for the most skilled of Illuminati, and shows how efficient these techniques are for an atavistic resurgence. In other words, this is a sexo-shamanistic technique used by the occult side of the Illuminati. But for now, let’s concentrate on the dream state and how to cultivate lucid dreaming. Dream-Yoga is both a shamanistic practice and it is also a Yoga in its own right. The procedure is simple, but the degree of patience and discipline needed might turn out to be a too strong a demand for those weak of structure and discipline. When once cultivated, this faculty, or 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"siddhi, will never be lost. Once you have accumulated this learning into your body and mind it will never be lost. When not concentrated on it will stay dormant, when concentrated on - it will come back into the waters of the time-lines. Never is a luminous being so fluid as when he or she is in the dream state. This state carries remnants of the spheres evoked through sorcery when the sorcerer is possessed, inspired or fulfilled by some spirit. You then enter into the Threshold-kingdom where your reason must die and the Naught shall remain and endure until the end. The most Holy Lama Namkai Norbu gives very good advice that is often overlooked by westerners in their practices with these streams of power: “In the Dzogchen school, there is the constant advice from a teacher to student that one must not be attached to experience for its own sake. Western approaches also encourage a systematic analysis of the content of dreams, whereas Dzogchen teachers encourage practitioners not to dwell upon dream phenomena.” [24] We are of the same opinion as the Dzogchen-school of Buddhist teachings, you should, by all means, preserve the fluidity. Through dreams all is possible. Through dreams access to all lines of time are possible. When this practice has been cultivated to perfection, the entering of these states are for a few chosen Masters open at all time to these invisible forces, through meditation. The constant access to the realms of dream is sometimes called by shamans to “see”. This signifies that some layers of this vast plane are dawning upon the Illuminati sorcerer so he or she is able to “see” the total picture of their surroundings. We will not concern ourselves with this issue yet because it will arise as a natural consequence for those with this disposition. But how is awareness in dreams cultivated? As earlier mentioned, it is fairly easy. First, you will find something to concentrate on, a syllable, a sign, form, point. Something that is easy to hold on to. You should not use complicated symbols, then your mind will wander around in contemplative porridge, disturbing the free flow towards the peak of dream awareness. When you go to bed you should be calm and quiet, no unbalance in the three gunas central to the philosophy of Yoga, should be hidden from you and you should focus your mind on your chosen symbol for ten minutes or so. Breathing should slow down a bit during these ten minutes. When you feel drowsy you should close your eyes and still maintain the image of your chosen symbol in your mind’s eye and fall asleep with this firmly fixed. When you sense that you are about to slide into the dream-state tell yourself that this symbol will keep you alert and aware and keep on 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"concentrating on the symbol. When you have entered the dream-state, it is truly a peculiar condition. All lucid dreaming and dream-control have the features common to extremely vivid dreams. You have had them yourself – dreams so intense that you use a few moments telling yourself that this was just a dream.... The truth is that a dream is never just a dream, it is a sacred space of multidimensional possibilities . The dream state is a common ground for the existence of angels and men, demons and elementals alike. The rewards for obtaining lucidity are so profane that the practice itself has led some Illuminati neophytes into obsession and complete craziness. When you are in the dream state, you should try to perform some fantastic acts of flying, jumping and divining only if you feel confident. The sensations are incredible but remember that after this state is cultivated you will have prepared a gateway that is easy to access from both sides, opening yourself to demonic possession, and possible madness, so it should never be attempted by anyone without necessary training by a true Master. My own experience with the teachings of Master Azoth in my late20’s and early 30’s while I was in Norway was illuminating, but also very scary at times. Certain things happened that could have killed me, and truly made me realize the power of evil nurtured by this adept of the dark arts once based in Oslo. Magick that is mainly used to cause harm, control, or even death to the victim, is definitely not my thing, but unfortunately, it is something I had to learn before I could fight it. A few words of concern in closing, again from the wisdom of Namkai Norbu: “When the State of dreaming has dawned, do not lie in ignorance like a corpse, Enter the natural sphere of unwavering attentiveness. Recognize your dreams and transform illusion into luminosity. Do not sleep like an animal. Do the practice which mixes sleep and reality.” [25] 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Chapter Three Is there a good side to Sex Magic and Alchemy? The “strange” teachings of a Rabbi Rabbi Kabbalis t Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla (1248 – after 1305) (Hebrew: יוסף בן אברהם ג'יקטיליה , Spanish: Chiquitilla, “the very little one), was a Spanish student of Abraham Abulafia ,who wrote at the end of the 13th century, a letter on holiness, also known as the relationship of man with his woman that had a fair bit of notoriety among the Jews. This letter, which figuratively shows him answering a difficult question from a disciple, teaches the method through which a man can control his sexual impulses and direct them to heaven regarding the act of coitus with his wife, in order to procreate children worthy of Yahweh (YHVH). According to Gikatilla, “YHVH” is the only name which represents the substance of God; the other names are merely predicates of the divine attributes. “YHVH” stands for God as He is, while “Elohim” denotes God as the creative power. In reality, this secret practice described by Rabbi Gikatilla describes an important secret of Illuminati sexual magic, as we will see. The letter consists of seven chapters divided like the arms of the Menorah, the sacred candlestick of the Jews, also used in Freemasonry. The author undertakes the difficult task of demonstrating that the sexual act, and its physical organs, are not impure things belonging to a lower demonic world but, and he does this on the authority of examples and canonical verses of the Jewish tradition, they are the direct expression of the creative will of God (Yahweh), and that it is only the mental attitude of man who makes it impure and vile. In this regard, he writes that the sexual act must be 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"“sanctified” through five material fulfillment. He, therefore, blames fellow Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides , who had expressed himself with such prejudice, and the philosopher pagan Aristotle, who he defines – while still drawing a great deal of knowledge from his doctrines – as “an impure Greek”, “a cursed Greek” and “Greek Belial”. He also argues that the character that every man assumes, is not derived from the stars, zodiacal constellations, and the disposition of the planets, like some Illuminati mystery schools state, even today, but instead from the particular animic composition of the male sperm at the moment of conception: Know that the matter and nature of man make it possible that he is good or bad with regard to his temperament on the basis of that drop from which he was conceived; It follows that the coitus of a man is responsible for the sanctification of Yahweh or of his desecration, according to the children he will put to the world. After explaining that the biblical term “knowing” in relation to the sexual act, is not an understatement, but the significance of the fulfillment of an act that loses all animalistic instincts to become a creation similar to the actions of God, he then reveals the fundamental secret: When the seed drop is emitted into holiness and purity, it comes directly from the seat of knowledge and discernment that is the brain. This means that when you join sexually with a woman, not allowing yourself to be carried away by her beauty, but keeping the mind firmly fixed towards the higher realities, we join in all effects with the Shekhinah – the manifestation of Yahweh so dear to the Illuminati and the Rosicrucians – an d wit h divine presence of God the soul of the future child is created: Keep this secret and do not reveal it to anyone, except to those who are worthy, because you now understand the secret of the elevation of the right of sexual intercourse. This is one of the greatest secrets of the Illuminati and is considered the secret of the Cherubim as it was symbolized within the Temple of Jerusalem. There is, however, a broader secret of sexual magic that does not have as its ultimate goal; procreation: All that we have here in this statement refers to the secret of the organization of the structures of the world and its edification, according to the image of males and females, based on the secret of the receiver and the diffuser, and the human couple is seen as a possible protagonist along an 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"ascending and descending scale that is the great chain of beings. Consequently, the coitus between man and woman if done following these instructions, is considered one of the biggest secrets of the illuminated elite and their families, and also the key to the correct edification of the ruling class, and of course, their secret to maintaining domination and wordly power, generation after generation. On the contrary, when man distracts his mind from the higher realities becoming the prey of his more material volitions, his sperm is apparently “putrid” in the eyes of the deity, and his children will simply be born as slaves of the Matrix, and nothing more. Rabb i Joseph Ben Abraham Gikatilla then illustrates another of the secret ways to “sanctify the sexual union”, it is the precept to join with the woman exclusively on Saturday, the Lord's Day for the Jews. This is not only not to waste an essence that in his eyes is not inexhaustible and whose dissipation might lead to disease and premature death, but also because the Sabbath is in analogy with the power of Yahweh: The reason why sexual union on the night of the Sabbath [exactly\" near the last half of the night \"] is that this is the foundation of the World , the reflection of the World of Souls (...). Moreover, we must approximate the relationship in conditions of perfect physiological harmony, and with great sensitivity towards the woman, who must not be taken against her will, and not while sleeping, but cleverly enticed with both tender embraces and spiritual discourses. Well, I know that most people in contemporary society reading such suggestions might find them funny, however, Rabb i Gikatilla also gives his students, what we can consider a modern kind of teaching, that will find most women today agreeing with him. He surprisingly states, in fact ,that man must not be in a hurry to conclude his sexual intercourse, and must make sure that the woman “to ejaculate first” because, as it is written in Leviticus , only if she has the orgasm before, one can conceive a male son. This must be shocking news for many, remember that even today, the ever-elusive female orgasm is still a mystery for the majority of people out there, and “its function is unclear,\" wrote Mihaela Pavlicev recently, a researcher at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, working on this “ancient mystery” with Gunter Wagner, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University. So indirectly, this secret revealed by Rabbi Gikatilla in this rare text studied for centuries by the Illuminati, 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"tells us that the woman, provides the animic matter that man must shape with the mind projected in the right direction, as the pot maker models his fresh clay. Also, the nourishment and the food we consume prior to the sexual act has its importance in relation to the coitus, therefore it must be temperate and moderate: Because if the nourishment is too abundant in the stomach, even if coming from good quality ingredients, an excess of it will cause it not to be digested and assimilated into the stomach, and will become bad, congested and heavy, more than it would have been if it had come from undigested and coarse foods but assumed in small quantities. It is not necessary to be vegetarian for Rabbi Joseph Ben Abraham Gikatilla, as Jewish law indicates perfectly which animal foods to take and which to abhor: Some must be avoided because they damage the heart, such as fat and blood, others because they make arrogant, like those coming from wild animals, birds of prey and fierce beasts, others still because they obstacle intelligence and wisdom, such as hare, rabbit, pig and the like, others finally because they involve different sorts of ailments and painful diseases, like terrestrial and aquatic reptiles in general. The author also explains en passant – but perhaps wanting to allude to a sexual secret – that killing animals for food is not a useless cruelty since it’s done so Yahweh allows the animal to evolve by participating in human nature. Not by chance, in France, at the end of the 1800s, there were a few Illuminati members who resumed this theory for magical and evolutionary purposes (amongst them Eugène Vintras and J oseph-Antoine Boullan, mentioned previously in my publications). In fact, rabbi Gikatilla writes: The specific case of the beast that is torn down to nourish man, constitutes good for the animal because it is elevated from a beastly level to that of the body of a man. It is the destiny of the four components of the world down here: minerals, plants, animals not endowed with words and talking animals. Then the author explains the key to this sexual secret: 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"You must know the great secret that was revealed to our masters, that in their memory is the blessing: The thoughts of transgression are worse than the transgression itself. I am by things that constitute the mystery of the world and which are disguised. (...) Now Yahweh has given the power to the imagination of man to bring about something similar to what is imagined, and this is also confirmed by many natural observations. Behold: When a man joins his woman, if his imagination and his thoughts are directed towards works of wisdom and intellect, towards good and appropriate qualities, this imagination, which is in its thinking, possesses without any doubt the strength to sculpt a form in the sperm produced according to what will have imagined at the time of sexual intercourse. Here the author has in view the conception of elected men, real Illuminati, that conform to the will of Yahweh when he chose the Jewish people as his favorite people: Thanks to Jacob our ancestor, peace be with him, merited to procreate twelve tribes, all composed of perfect righteous people, including neither perverse nor calibrated ones. All were worthy of being the image of the Order of the world, bearers of the instruments of Yahweh since their thoughts had not separated from the contact with the highest, even at the time of sexual intercourse; hope you understand this well. It seems to non-Jews a system to avoid racial degeneration (in the sense of the race of the spirit of which Baron Julius Evola spoke), but it is also well understood as a magical secret because, as the author himself writes, at the time of the sexual act, the man and the woman participate in the creator power of Yahweh, in the general sense, and not only particular (the formation of another human being). From an operational point of view, Rabbi Gikatilla makes it clear that this creation is rather simple because it would suffice to have before the eyes, even without an effort of imagination, the representation of what you want to create. But this seems valid only if the man is totally focused and the woman remains impressed by the particular vision of something strong brought in the equation at the time of conception. “For so it is, mental representation and thought that determines the child be born just, or wicked,” as well as it also contributes for this purpose to ingest the right food, and therefore it is necessary that every man purifies his body as well as his thoughts and his mental representations at the time of sexual intercourse, with no transgressive or 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"lustful thoughts, but only thoughts of Holy things. Not easy, my friends, if not impossible in the age of lust and porn, to clear our thoughts of wicked fantasy, but the elite know this, that’s why they are in charge of humanity. However, this means that the good elite, the ones that help mankind develop and move further, when copulating for purposes of mating, think of the righteous, the pure, the saints and Men of science, wisdom, and intelligence, because these thoughts act on the sperm and will model it according to their own form at the time of coitus. The wicked elite, the ones that unfortunately prevail these days, and dominate mankind in this age of corruption and pain, are the result of evil thoughts and perverse sexual practices within their own families. The rabbi also specifies that the woman must have the same thoughts and images of the man during the sexual union: They will be so mutually united with the subject of the commandment because then their thoughts will be closely joined and the Shekhinah will reside between them and give birth to a child according to the pure form that they will have imagined. Don't be surprised, it is a simple fact also in the eyes of the philosophers, because according to the thought and the mental representation that crosses the heart of man and woman at the time of their embrace, the child will be prepared and conformed either to the good or to the evil, or to the beauty or to the laid. On the basis of an example taken from Rabbi Nahmanides, and alleged by Gikatilla, it seems that the same images formed also accidentally (for example, following a feverish delirium) are visible in the person's urine, after an hour of resting in a glass jar: For the abundance of his thoughts and the confusion of his spirit, the forms of his imagination and his delusions get imprinted in his urine. Understand all this and consider as far as the force of thought is pushed at the time of the coitus. Finally, Rabbi Gikatilla, emphasizes that it is almost negative for a wise man to take a beautiful woman as his wife, because her beauty will inevitably distract the man from elaborating a spiritual and superior form at the time of embrace and, indeed, will end up generating an unworthy and material being. When marrying a woman for her beauty the sexual intercourse does not happen in the name of Yahweh, and he does not think of his form on the basis of bodily appearance and is not directed toward spiritual ideas so 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"that the son who is born is a stranger [for Yahweh] (...) Since the concentration of thought is only addressed to the beauty of the wife, it will be born disobedient sons and enemies of Yahweh, susceptible to the four sanctions of death inflicted by a Jewish tribunal. For the rabbi, when man thinks of things evil and dirty, his thought on the dirt connects to the higher realities and his soul is guilty to heaven because it makes it impure by contact. In practice, the rabbi affirms that one can also knowingly create in the opposite direction to the wishes of heaven – here is the magic meaning – although this will entail a far worse sanction than those who commit a normal material sin: From here you understand the secret of the one who thinks of transgression at the time of coitus because this undue thought goes to model the sperm from which a principle of perversity is established with iniquity and filth and this is said to be extraneous. You will understand this if you truly have a soul. The connection with the upper realities that is realized for a short time in the moment of the coitus is a concept we have also discussed in the past when learning about the evil side of the Illuminati, and wicked occultists lik e Aleister Crowley. This practice that when held firmly in our mind during every sexual act, allows to develop a power of life and death, and helps to modify ones reality according to your own will, a teaching Crowley made clear with his motto: “Love is the law, love under will”, but also a teaching that Rabbi Joseph Ben Abraham Gikatilla saw in a completely different light from “The Great Beast”, a more positive one that Gikatilla confirmed, citing a few passages of canonical literature, making the clearest explanation regarding sexual secret practices amongst the elite many centuries before the dark side of the Illuminati took over the show and launched the sexual magick myth with dangerous sects like the O.T.O and so on. However, at the end of his short essay/letter, while discussing how we get in touch with the higher realities using sex, Gikatilla, seems to finally mention the ambivalence of this occult practice when he tells the story of Balaam in the Book of Numbers : You understand the meaning of this and you will see how far the strength of meditation and thought comes, aimed at good or evil.

I have been asked to integrate the subject of alchemy, and the Royal Art of the Illuminati, of which Sexual Magick is an integral part, further in my books. Arion Love, who grew up in the revolutionary sixties in California, is an independent researcher of alchemy and has been studying the esoteric spiritual traditions since 1967. He writes with great expertise on the subject: The great secret of alchemy is the Divine Marriage of opposites which gives birth to the Spirit Body of transcendence associated with liberation of the soul. The exact process of metamorphosis leading to the creation and birth of the spirit body within the physical body has long been veiled in mystery and secrecy. The spirit body is not to be confused with one’s subtle body or subtle bodies which one already has from birth. The creation and birth of the spirit body is an entirely unique process found within the various world traditions of alchemy. The spirit body has gone by names like Deva Deha, Siddha Deha, Golden Pearl, Merkaba, Rainbow Body, Diamond Body, Star Body, and Immortal Body of Light. You can find the most revealed aspects of this process in Chinese Taoist Alchemy and East Indian Tantric Alchemy . Traditionally, the process was taught from teacher to student in a step by step series of initiations. One did not progress until first mastering each successive step. The foundation for this process can be found in traditional Yoga comprised of physical postures, breathing, and mantra sound meditation. Yoga means union with the absolute. Depending upon the culture, the opposites were variously known as Fire and Water, Sun and Moon, Soul and Spirit, Male and Female, Mercury and Sulfur, King and Queen, Heaven and Earth, Shiva and Shakti, Kan and Li, Yin and Yang, Ka and Ba, Isis and Osiris, Soma and Agni. Also, this marriage parallels the practice of Tantric sexual union and unfoldment of the inner life energy referred to as the Kundalini. This process is also mirrored in the Jewish mystical tradition of the Kabbalah when ascending the Tree of Life, which esoterically is the seven energy centers or chakras that run up the spinal column to the brain. The alchemical marriage of opposites can be seen in the symbolism of the intersecting triangles of the Jewish Star of David, Seal of Solomon, and the Sri Yantra of India. The upward pointing 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"triangle symbolizes the male or fire principle, and the downward pointing triangle symbolizes the female or water principle. The Bindu point in the center of the Sri Yantra symbolizes the point of transcendence. The Yantra is a graphic symbol of the Mantra. The Mantra corresponds to the Five Elements and Logos or Word of God. Also, the marriage of opposites can be seen in the symbolism of the Christian Cross. The ancient Caduceus symbol used by the modern medical establishment symbolizes on an esoteric level the alchemical process. The staff represents the spinal column which correlates with the Sushumna Nadi channel of yogic esoteric anatomy. The two ascending spirals of snakes represent the solar and lunar currents known as the ida and pingala of the kundalini life force. The spiral pattern is similar to the spirals of the human DNA. The symbolism of Jacobs Ladder or Stairway to Heaven corresponds with the Staff of Life. [27] FIG 13 – Masonic Tracing Board from the Entered Apprentice Degree from St. Andrew's Lodge in the UK.

This ascent is made possible from its beginnings, in the doctrines of the Holy Book, followed by ascending the steps of Faith and Hope, which in turn lead to the summit - CHARITY. The second mention of Jacob’s Ladder in the ritual, is in the explanation of the first Tracing Board, which refers to the Volume of the Sacred Law supporting Jacob’s Ladder, but this time it brings us directly to God in Heaven, provided that we are conversant with the Holy Book and are adherent to its doctrines. The Introduction of Jacob’s Ladder into speculative Masonry is to be traced to the vision of Jacob, which is recorded in the book of Genesis. “When Jacob, while sleeping one night, with the bare earth for his couch and a stone for his pillow, beheld the vision of a ladder, whose foot rested on the earth and whose top reached to heaven. Angels were continually ascending and descending upon it and promised him the blessing of a numerous and happy prosperity. When Jacob awoke, he was filled with pious gratitude, and consecrated the spot as the house of God.” This ladder, so remarkable in the history of the Jewish people, is found in all the ancient initiations. Whether by coincidence or that they were all derived from a common fountain of symbolism is unknown. However, it is certain that the ladder as a symbol of moral and intellectual progress, existed almost universally in antiquity, as a succession of steps, of gates, of degrees or in some other modified form. The number of steps varied; but most commonly was seven, in allusion to the mystical importance given to that number. Thus in the Persian mysteries of Mithras , there was a ladder of seven rounds, the passage through them being symbolic of the soul’s approach to perfection. These rounds were called Gates, and, in allusion to them, the candidate was made to pass through seven dark and winding caverns, which process was called the ‘Ascent of the Ladder of Perfection’ . Each rung of the ladder was said to be of metal and of increasing purity and was dignified also with the name of its protecting planet. The highest being Gold and the Sun, next Silver and the Moon . . . through to Lead and Saturn. In the mysteries of Brahma, we find the same reference to a ladder of seven steps, with similar names. In Scandinavian mysteries, the tree Yggrasil was the representative of the 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"mystical ladder. The ascent of the tree, like the ascent of the ladder, was a change from a lower to a higher sphere - from time to eternity, and from death to life. In the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, we find the ladder of Kadosh, which consists of seven steps, commencing from the bottom : Justice - Equity - Kindness - Good Faith - Labour - Patience and Intelligence. The idea of Intellectual progress to perfection is carried out by the top rung, which represents Wisdom or Understanding. The ladder in Craft Masonry also consists of seven steps, ascending as follows : Temperance - Fortitude - Prudence - Justice - Faith - Hope - and Charity. But the earliest examples of the ladder present it only with three, referring to the three theological virtues, whence it is sometimes called the Theological Ladder. It seems, therefore, to have been determined by general usage to have only three steps. In the 16th century it was stated that Jacob’s ladder was a symbol of the progressive scale of intellectual communication between earth and heaven; and upon this ladder, as it were, step by step, man is permitted - with the angels - to ascend and to descend, until the mind finds blissful and complete repose in the bosom of divinity. [28] A sort of ‘zigzag’ of Creation, that Brother Mark Stavish , from Wyoming Lodge No. 468, Director of Studies for the Institute for Hermetic Studies, who has also published several books related to Freemasonry, describes it in this way: This ‘zigzag’ of Creation is called the “Lightning Flash”. The return of energy from dense matter, back through the various stages, Sephiroth, and Worlds of Creation is known as the “Path of the Serpent” because of its reverse, or complementary ‘zigzag’ nature back up this diagram called the Tree of Life. For the alchemist , somewhere between the third and fourth level, or sphere of creation, energy takes on the characteristic that will allow for the formation of matter at some future state, or level ten. This energy is called Prima Materia, Chaos in the Bible, Spiritus Mundi (Spirit of the Earth), and others. Here, duality is made complete, and genuine polarity exists, as opposed to simply the potential, or idea, of polarity that had existed previously. Energy is divided into active and passive modes, with the active energy constituting the energies of life, and the passive one, the energy of matter. In “The Golden Chain of Homer”, the active energy, is called Niter, and the passive energy is called Salt.The energy of Life manifests in two forms, Fire and Air.

In the second half of the Eighteenth Century, Europe witnessed the emergence or re-emergence of the mythical hypostasis of a “chain” of secret and invisible masters, superhuman keepers of wisdom and power, if not hidden custodians of the destinies of History itself. A cryptic subject that had already been used as the backbone of the meta-cultural and meta- political movement of the Rosicrucians from the first decades of the 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Seventeenth Century; and by the Masonic Neotemplars of the Rite of Strict Observance a century later. It is evidently impossible to cover within this book, the multiple reading keys of the myth of the Unknown Superiors and Secret Chiefs, and it isn’t possible to cover questions of all various forms, and for this reason, I have dedicated the upcoming work, The Invisible Master, to this important subject We can, however, consider for now, the most immediate and acceptable interpretation of the idea, that shows a chain of Invisible Masters connected with ultra-dimensional aliens, working behind the curtains of history since the beginning of time. In this sense, the concept of an invisible community of Illuminati becomes more than real, in a sort of figurative projection and archetype of the radical biological and spiritual mutation towards which the human race is heading, albeit unknowingly, guided by mysterious alien forces. The hidden and invisible notion of this mysterious Circle of Secret Chiefs is characterized by its inherent fear existing within any social-historical order for this secret reality. This is particularly obvious when it is found within the very foundations of a society whose stability depends on a legalistic and materialistic system. The ingeniousness of this manipulative mechanism usually becomes either the divinity to be adored or the dreadful demons to be exorcised, without understanding the whole point of this charade. An inquisitive reading of history, full of moments of great cultural, religious or scientific transformations, will reveal that quite often under the surface or behind the curtain of events, cultural crisis and, political-religious mutations, lies the intervention of ideas and forces, as well as structured organizations working willingly or unwillingly for the alien overlords. These are always somewhat related, one way or another, to the archaic dimensions of Magick and its rituals operated by the Illuminati Ufonauts since ancient times to interface with the UFO/alien reality. For a long time, rumors have circulated amongst researchers that the UFO phenomenon is somehow directly linked to the Illuminati and the occult. Now, with my upcoming work The Invisible Master you will find startling proof of those connections and exposes the heart of the UFO mystery with the revelation of the hidden Secret Ciphers and Rituals used by UFOnauts, Contactees, Occult Adepts and their Secret Chiefs who have maintained communication with these mysterious alien/Ultraterrestrial beings who control interdimensional forces beyond our comprehension. There are, however, human adepts in both the Western, and Eastern initiatic systems, who are part of an ancient tradition in alien contact, stretching from remote 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"antiquity to the present time. This is the ultimate secret knowledge of the so-called blue blood aristocrats. In this context, the flourishing dissemination of new and revolutionary spiritual, philosophical and artistic notions that determined the beginning of the European Renaissance, was piloted by the Illuminati of the time for a secret mission known only to the initiated few.The dissemination in the days of neo-Gnostic and neo-Pagan ideas, which were increasingly found among the erudite Magi of the academies, and courts in those days, was only a first step towards what will become many centuries later the New Age movement. In a slightly different form, there is a seemingly distant magical reality found among the popular Shamanic and Wizardry movements, often in contact with certain alien beings since ancient times, working independently from the hierarchical structure of the “Occult Theocracy” . The rebirth of Hermeticism, Alchemy, and Magick in Europe finds its roots, however, in the diffusion of the Alexandrian Hermetic texts, dated from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, which were barely whispered about during the entire Middle Ages for fear of reprisal by the Vatican mafia. The rebirth was fuelled by works such as Corpus Hermeticum translated by Cosimo of Medici in 1462 and probably influenced by the neo-Pagan passion of Giorgio Gemisto Pletone (1355-1452) and later edited and preserved carefully by the Neo-Platonist Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499). Ficino and others made several ambiguous attempts to identify Hermetic Gnosticism with some kind of proto-Christianity, thus presenting Plato and even the mythical Hermes Trismegistus as the precursors of the Fathers of the Church, while they simply represent the ancient Illuminati mystery schools that even our Master Jesus joined during his time in Egypt. At the same time and rather synchronically, in a different social context, witches and wizards in the countryside and hillsides, were practicing and spreading their contact with alien demonic forces, through witchcraft in honour of the dark side, and in obvious antagonism to the totem of the Cross and the official rituals of the “Occult Theocracy” in place in that time. It was precisely through the ambiguity of the Ficinian neo-Platonic Academia that the Christian model continued to represent the filter, in the more knowledgeable spheres, of every approach to the Hermetic Art and Magick itself. This was made particularly evident throughout the rise and tribulations of the Rose-Croix movement and the birth of Rosicrucianism, who was the first to translate the myth of the Unknown Superiors as authentic Masters and organized brotherhoods, where Hermetic-Alchemic practices and Philosophy were an integral part of their teachings. Ancient 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Illuminati symbols where transmitted, and concealed in the architecture of the major monuments, and revealed only to the most worthy initiates by the mythical Unknown Superiors. This was achieved methodically, mainly through the awakening and formation of Brotherhoods, Sisterhoods, and initiatic Communities, especially in Europe and later America, which synchronically declared to be instigated, inspired and guided by the mythical Unknown Superiors. On entering Crowley’s A ∴ A ∴ , for example, aspirants must acquiesce, still to this day in the complete subordination of their “will” to that of the “Unknown Superiors”. This provision places them entirely in the power of the “Order” and its Secret Chiefs. Some of these Illuminati Brotherhoods like the O.T.O. had been involved from the very beginning in the reawakening of the alien/stellar, alchemical and psychosexual magical practices present in the diabolical New Age Movement, headed by the deviant side of the ancient mystery schools controlled by the dark side. Their aim is rather obvious since their operational practices gravitated around a misinterpretation of sexual magick, used for a possible constitution of an “Immortal Body” or “Body of Light”, producing in most cases spiritual monstruosities, and zombies for the New World Order nothing more. This tradition of transforming nature and of self-divinization of men and women through alchemical- sexual techniques is thousands of years old, and the Illuminati have always been aware of it, but the increasingly corrupt world of secret societies have used it in the wrong way. Therefore Sexual Alchemy arises from extreme antiquity as one of the most direct survivors of the knowledgeable patrimony of the Mother-Goddess so dear to the New Age Movement, especially in its operational aspects, be it internal or psychosexual. For the Ufologist, Satanist, and Illuminati, Roberto Negrini from Italy past Grand Master of the O.T.O.-F.H.L. and now president of th e Accademia Pansofica , if we can indeed define Magick, based on our own unitary paradigm, as the Art and Science of the balancing powers between the various components of the being, we therefore can define Alchemy as one of these components of this Art and Science . Alchemy for Negrini is an array of manipulation techniques of natural forms (mineral, plant or animal, chemical or biological) as well as of the physical or para-physical elements of which is it composed. These techniques are capable of separating these elements and reassembling them into different configurations, thus obtaining transmutations and forms of control and amplification on the vital biological and meta- biological processes of nature as well as the perceptive modalities of human consciousness. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" For Negrini it is with these colors that Alchemy has re-emerged in the New Age at the heart of the modern rebirth of Magick, with the ambition to reaffirm this time publicly the magical conscience. As part of this rebirth, the emergence of the psychosexual aspects is the most relevant aspect for Negrini, who was, however, arrested on charges of pedophilia in March 2013, showing once again the real nature of Crowley’s adepts and their deviant psychosexual mission, serving the darkest forces on earth with their perversions. These aspects represent the operational foundations of the darkest Illuminati who are busy manipulating internal and external forces around, just like the late Jimmy Savile (1926-2011) did during his lifetime, as a deviant witch, and a pedophile, without ever suffering any consequences for his evil actions. He lived his life to the max in the most depraved way following Aleister Crowley’s motto : Do what thou wilt . Saville used his alleged black magic powers to put TV bosses, celebs, powerful politicians, and even members of the Royal Family and policemen, under his spell. It is therefore natural that the initiatic movements of the New Age like the O.T.O., are the cradles in which the Alchemic paradigm has been preserved to some extent in a rather distorted form, only capable of its “darkest” interpretation and evil actions. Dark figures like Aleister Crowley have been used by the Secret Chiefs, who are the sacred guardians presiding over the initiation of the Human Race, to test Mankinds Faith in front of God, and work in cohorts with the fallen angels in this unfolding end-times scenario. Understanding Mental Alchemy Mary Anne South (1817–1910) , known later in life with her married surname Atwood, was an English writer on hermeticism and spiritual alchemy , wh o was not just a great Alchemical “adept”, but even as “the last one”, who operated during that time frame historians now define as Victorian Occultism , born out of the Victorian era. Mary Anne's first publication, Early Magnetism in its higher relations to humanity (1846), was issued pseudonymously as the work Thuos Mathos, an anagram of Thomas South, the name of her father. She was also member as was her father, of a rather obscure neoplatonic secret society of the Illuminati Network, called the Zojst, founded by Thomas Taylor (1758 –1835), who 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"was the first English translator and Neoplatonist to translate into English the complete works of Aristotle and Plato, as well as the Orphic fragments. So a pretty important figure of English culture, Atwood’s material is very important for the study of a vanished Britain when Neo-Platonism and High Ideas influenced the nation. But, as Mrs. Atwood stated, “ They went in for power and threw their spiritual heritage out the window. ” This significant quote that could be found at the Mary Anne Atwood archive website, maintained by the Brown University, demonstrates how Ms. Atwood clearly understood, even back then, the spiritual decline of the Western Initiatic System, and the evil quest for power of the occult elite of the Illuminati Network. Understanding Victorian Occultism is relevant to us today, so we can have a full picture of the Illuminati Network, and the origins of Modern Satanism, and provides indeed a comprehensive account of the historical roots and philosophical underpinnings of influential orders, like the S.R.I.A., or the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. From Occult Freemasonry ( a term coined by Eliphas Levi), to Rosicrucianism, and Egyptian magic, to Victorian innovations and inventions, this is a key chapter in the decline of the Western Initiatic System, and the rise of the so-called “New Age” built for the New World Order. Alison Butler wrote in Victorian Occultism and the Making of Modern Magic : The hierarchical and ritual nature of secret societies and the supernatural setting of the spiritualists provided the perfect ingredients for the development and nurturing of Victorian occultism. The formulation of its doctrines was deeply entwined with a reliance and reinterpretation of other esoteric and marginal traditions. As a product of its time, fin-de- siècle magic was subject to the literary, philosophical, political and religious influences of the era. The Nineteenth-century thought was fundamentally affected by the rising popularity of secularization and science and Victorian occultism was no exception. Nineteenth-century people were necessarily having to deal with an understanding of themselves both as individuals independent of the determinism implicit in the Christian understanding of creation, and as individuals who were progressively becoming superior to all that came before . [30] In this important context, Ms. Atwood wrote, at her father's request, what became a very influential study within the theosophical and Illuminati milieu, called A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery , published in 1850. Lawrence M. Principe, one of the world's leading authorities on 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"the subject, and distinguished professor William R. Newman, in their more recent publications from the early 2000’ s , consider A Suggestive Inquiry, to be one of three books which started the influence of the spiritual interpretation of alchemy in early modern Europe. Ms. Atwood published nothing after this, and it was something she prepare d in parallel with her father’s own composition of a lengthy poem on the same subject. Thomas South was happy to pay for the publication of the book, that was published anonymously by a known English publisher, but without having read it, he hadn’t realized its contents. Basically, he completely trusted his daughter's judgment. That was apparently a big mistake for Thomas South when after reading it, was shocked by what Mary Anne had revealed publicly. For Mr. South, and the occult elite, all this was better left unpublished. Therefore, he bought up the remaining stock and, with his daughter, burned them, along with the unfinished manuscript of his own poem. Imagine this incredible scene from another era! Probably, for this reason, the writer Lindsay Clarke used the story of Thomas South and Mary Anne Atwood, as a basis for his novel, The Chymical Wedding that came out in 1989. Only a few copies of Mary Anne’s mysterious work survived the destruction, once her father ceased the contract with the publisher. Eventually, eight years later, and after Ms. Atwood’s death, one of these rare copies made it to print in 1918, creating once again turmoil and waves, in the secretive world of the Western Initiatic System and related mystery schools. This happened thanks to Walter Leslie Wilmshurst (1867 –1939), who was an English author, and an erudite Freemason, who also added in this new edition, some very interesting unpublished notes from Ms. Atwood, as an appendix, that contained table talk, and memorabilia. 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"FIG 15 – A rare autographed photo of the late Mary Anne Atwood Explanatory notes full of secrets and incredible knowledge, connected to the secret teachings of the Illuminati Mystery Schools of the Western Initiatic System, that Ms. Atwood apparently wrote, but never published, back in 1860. Notes that I will now include after this introduction, because of the importance of Mary Anne Atwood’s work, and the possibility that her notes might unlock one of the biggest secrets of the Illuminati: Mental Alchemy. A huge secret, hidden in the pages of her controversial book, described by the illustrious Mainly P. Hall , ( best known for his 1928 work The Secret Teachings of All Ages ) , as “The most mysterious, I suppose that has been written in modern times, it presents a riddle more difficult than the most scientifically contrived mystery” . So what is this mysterious and difficult riddle? What is this mystery, that pushed her own father, to destroy almost all the copies of the first edition of her book? Is it the key secret of Mental Alchemy? Brother Walter Leslie Wilmshurst, in his 1918 introduction to the reissue, lamented that the thoughts and writings of Ms. Atwood, in her later years, never made it to another book. He claimed, that there is much to be found in her papers, of which he was then in possession. These have not yet been published. The special collections archive of the 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Brown University library currently holds around 700 of Ms. Atwood's letters. However, I think we need to study Mary Anne Atwood’ work, especially the following 181 notes published in the 1918 edition by Brother Wilmshurst: 1. The Magic of the self-will is that which the Egyptians practiced in the days of Moses; this is to be found in the release or setting free the third or lowest life. Of this power we know nothing in this present life, the ordinary life of man; we may imagine into it, and theoretically see it, but that is all; nor do we know it in the common entranced life, i.e., the life of the sleep-wakers; but this present life may be led throught the clairvoyant life into it (that is the wonderful part of it) by the fermentation of itself. 2. As this life being fermented by this life, its similar, leads into the common trance, or is entranced, so that consequent life being fermented subsequently by its similar, leads into that third life which moves in and with the creative Essence, so that the mind becomes in that case related to the Universal Vitalising Power, and so can act its will. Power thus gained is only legitimate, just and righteous, when the will subserves the commandment and law of God; taken into the self-will and used accordingly, it becomes diabolical; hence the distinction between the “might in word and deed” of Moses and the \"enchantments \" of the Egyptians. 3. The universal Spirit is in one form the Principle of all growth, and it is their power of collecting a quantity of this, bringing it to bear or any germ at, that furnishes the Eastern jugglers with their power of perfecting suddenly those plants and trees which in the ordinary course of the action of this Life-principle in Nature would have taken years. 4. Magicians, like the Egyptians of that day, drew only from their own strength; that was the way in which the kingdom of Egypt fell; probably they did not originally act in self-will, but drew their power from the Divine Source as Asclepius says (see the Dialogue, so-called, the 2nd Book of Hermes ch. 9) alluding to their falling off into debasement and idolatry. 5. Alchemy is a universal art of vital chemistry, which by fermenting the human spirit, purifies, and, finally dissolving it, opens the elementary germ into new life and consciousness; and the Philosopher's Stone is the efflux 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of such a life, drawn to a focus and made manifest as a concrete Essence of Light, which Essence is the true Form or Idea of Gold. The process takes place in and through the human body in the blood, changing the relation of its component parts or principles, and reversing the circulatory order, so that, the sensible medium becoming occult, the inner source of its vitality is awakened, and the consciousness at the same time being drawn centrally, comes to know and feel itself in its own true Source, which is the Universal Centre and source of all things. 6. And since every being has in himself the cause of his own existence if by these alleged means the consciousness can be brought into contact with its First Cause, he will, in knowing It know the cause of all, since Existence is everywhere one and universal, and, in fact, the one ultimate essential mystery under God. This Mystery is, as the Hermetists teach, to be discovered by an artificial dissolution of the natural bond of life, resulting in a regeneration of the dissolved separated elements, under a reversed law; the will holding and drawing from its proper efficient operates, and mind becomes creative and immortalised in it. 7. The law of Will in these higher states of being is to have motion from its own centre. It has motion in itself, this motivity when in act evolves an effervescence of the Will-being or substance; for Will has substance, nay, is the only substance; it is the Universal Loadstone of Existence. This effervescent efflux is in itself chaotic, and requires to be taken up by an external mind or intelligence, and this mind, when thus related to it, and under its law, becomes creative and immortalised. 8. As long as we in our life go on in a line we are not immortal, but when our life is returned in faith (for it is faìth which re-unites) to its beginning, it forms the circle, and is in Eternity. It must also be observed that there is a law of Light, which must move through Love in the will, and so act on the will-moved mind, and to which it must be subservient, else it breaks and becomes demoniacal. The wonderful part of the process is that the spirit becoming freed from the body, carries on the perfection and purifìcation of its own vehicle: the soul. There is a time when the power, the vital or willing-power, is seated in the lumbar region and is sent back. I think there is a time, when the mind comes into relation with the macrocosmic Spirit, and discerns it, and is taught by it. (c.f., Vaughan's Writings on the Chymical Wedding , p. 4.) 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"9. The perpendicular line is the Divine line in all things; the transverse line is the contrary; the two united form a cross + . In mesmerising and de- mesmerising we form a + . It is curious that by this peculiar action the perpendicular line should withdraw you from sense while the transverse restores you to it. 10. The fìre of life in us is capable of burning erect, it becomes a magnet! Wonderful! If, in us, the Divine line were stronger than the transverse one, we should be no longer in sense. The Divine or rather celestial life would be established over it in us, and we should be conscious in it, and placed in a transcendental relation. And as the sky appears to us concave and, when cloudless, blue in colour, so the Upper Ether, where the Ideas are, appears to the exalted spirit, i.e., the spirit in the medial life, as its azure sky. N.B. - The brain is to this outward life what the spiritual head is to the spirit. There is, as the Swedenborgians would say, a correspondence between them. 11. The limbs in the microcosm play a most important part in this mystery for the evolution and perfecting of the Divine within; it is thus that the body is regarded by St. Paul as a temple of the Holy Ghost, and it is for this, that in their highest and ultimate use, its different members have their being; they are a laboratory that is of and for the spirit to work in. 12. The order adopted by the Hermetic writers may seem to be most disorderly, but it is not so much so as it appears; the fact is, they often describe different phenomena occurrent in the different repetitions of the process; see, for example, the \"Golden Treatise.\" The fermentative process has to be gone over and over again, and thus the author of that Treatise seems purposely to confuse and intermix the several steps taken in the work, when in reality he is describing the stages taken and the results reached, as the Artist begins, ends, and repeats the mysterious experiment. 13. The macrocosmic image of the microcosm is the downward-born nature of which Hermes speaks very finely in the Pimander. It is the Eve which Adam brought forth, and in which he beheld as an image his own soul, the Absolute Idea of the Beautiful, the Divine image; the reason why it is macrocosmic, passive and ephemeral is its want of consubstantiality; it is an image, thrown forth, which image of perfect beauty attracts the soul, and united to it brings forth the ideal into an actual offspring. 14. The Hermetic sepulchre is the vehicle of the dead Divine Life within 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"us, and at the same time it is the death of itself - “ idem est sepulchrum ac cadaver.\" 15. The Gold Alchemical is the first conceived Paternal Light- it is the seed metaphysical of mineral gold, which Aeneas was told by the Sybil that he must find and gather. 16. The \" orient animal \" means the animal (that is, the opposite) which is clothed in Light; the third which rises in opposition to the first. 17. The Golden Fleece is the outward appearance presented by the light of Life diffused over the body of the seeker in the third life; it is of a purplish lustre. The seeker, however, in this point of relation, is the adept, the discoverer, the finder. 18. In the lower development of the Hermetic life, the quintessences successively form themselves, having each of them a spherical capacity and wholeness, but these world forms are unstable and, uninformed with the Light Essential, resolve and die. 19. In the vital changes which are intimately connected with the spirit ehanges occurrent in the process, the vital force in the blood undergoes alchemical changes in its relation to the body. There are three principles in this force, Attraction, Circulation, Repulsion - the Alchemical Salt, Mercury, Sulphur. What is really changed is the magnetic attraction; the medial spirit is changed; life is 'attracted in , instead of out . 20. We must remember that Alchemy is Divine Chemistry, and the transmutation of Life; and therefore that which is the medium between soul and body is changed, and the soul freed from the chains of corporeity, and the body is left as a mere husk. These people put on their bodies as mere coats. 21. The principle of body is preserved in what they call the ashes or Caput mortuum , and that one principle being saved the whole life is restored from it; Khunrath calls it “our pigmy”, also “the diadem of the body”, and I think he refers to it under the term “ Duanach ”. 22. It is a curious thing that the Third Principle, i.e., the «siderial and elementary birth, to use Böhme's language, is the medium of perceiving the First, which is hidden in its mineral life; that life is full of defilements 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"and temptations; it is therefore necessary, before going into it consciously, that the will and purpose be perfectly pure and simple in this return of the reason into its First Cause; the motive is segregated from the wholc life as a pure Light allied to that which it seeks. 23. The word fermentation conveys an idea of the perfecting principle and of the possibility of transmutation beyond any other word, and also of the fixation or everlasting preservation of which they speak; and so of immortality, it is the best image of the Divine Art which earthly processes give. Alchemy is a process of fermenting the vital Spirit in, and by its own Light. The Vital Spirit is in the Universal as well as in the individual. In the Art the individual draws the Universal. The best illustration of the Art as a fermentative process is given by Basil Valentine in his \" Keys.\" It is through this Art that man is brought into relationship with God, hence it is called by the Adepts Holy Alchemy; thus Norton says - \"It is most profound philosophy, this subtle science of Holy Alchemy.\" The moment men begin to reduce the ontological ground taken by Adepts to physical science they begin to twaddle. 24. Lorenz Oken (Author of Elements of Physiophilosophy. London, Ray Society 1847) is a man who will be appreciated someday, I suspect. He is a man who deals with nature in that higher way, never in that lower; it strikes me that of all writers Oken best evolves Causal Truth into the outward forms of life. 25. There are three Lives to be represented. The Terrestrial , the Celestial , the Infernal . The Terrestrial is the sensuous and represents the Animal Kingdom. In man it is dominant in the head. The Celestial is the emotional, receptive, instinctive life, and represents the Vegetable Kingdom. In man it resides in the epigastric region and heart; the plexus solaris , the Archaeus of Paracelsus, is its workshop. The Infernal is the voluntary agent in life, and represents the Mineral Kingdom. In man it resides in the lumbar region. Each of these lives is dominant in the Kingdom of Nature to which it is especially attached; in fact, it is its essential quality, its substance. We must remember that man, being a microcosm, comprehends and represents the whole and each. 26. The aim in the Work is to reverse the whole action of these lives in their natural order. Man is fallen; he is in the third or lowest life, and this third life has to be raised up and born through the medial or celestial life, 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"and becomes receptive of the Divine. Man must not dare to aspire to that highest life which is over this birth and which is typified by the terrestrial or head life, since if he were there he would become Creative —he would be taking to himself the Divine Will. 27. That which in the hands of fools is nothing in that of a philosopher becomes to be all in all - says one; all depends on the willing and intention -\" ex fine cujusvis intentionis resultat principium ejus ,\" and so, too, it is true and less paradoxical that \" finis ab origine pendet .\" The difficulty is to find this principium, the intention; for the rational ferment, the pure aurific seed of Light, is hidden in this life of ours. 28. Will creates an image, not a being. The will passing into desire for the image creates it by union with itself into a being; it begets itself out of itself, as it were out of its own image (e.f., Behmen's \"Three-fold Life,\" chap. 10 and 12.) All the Creation until man was an image; man was made permanent by the breathing into him of the breath of Lives, and so became the image of God and from that a son of God; as the Almighty had done for him so he did for the creatures; his \"naming\" them specificated and vitalized the whole archetypal world; he developed into actuality that which before was potential. The revelation of the Mystery is nothing without its use, for it is a vital change. 29. The powers developed, of which the Adepts speak, are produced from emotional sources in the heart, which emotional influences qualitate those powers; contrition, love, purity, mercy, humility, are such emotions and are producible not so much materially as essentially. Emotion brings forth essence, and essence is qualitated, i.e., specificated, and receives form from Ideas' or the universal forms of Nature ; thus, in lower degrees and unlawfully, man may specificate and qualitate from his own mind; in this consists the true idolatary against which the Bible so strongly protests, And that Magic which originated Talismans, Palladia, etc.; It is a taking the First Matter which is humanly producible, And forming it finitely and for any particular object or Individual end. 30. The fire of the natural life entering into and fermenting the natural fire - the same life in another - opens the last, and develops and excites and sets free the celestial Life and Light - that is one main principle. The third principle is developed in like manner. The fourth contrariwise; it is a procreation of the third through the second - a retrogression. The mystery 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"is a wonderful one, the phenomena are constant throughout. It can be talked about in such a commonplace way and yet it is so far above the apprehension of the common life. 31. The spirit teaches its own art, and according as it is obeyed, the artist goes on developing the way for him to advance itself to perfection. Ut vcntus qui flat, est ille qui dat is one of the old Alchemical sayings and it is full of meaning. No doubt this is analogous to our Lord's words, \" The wind bloweth where it listeth.\" He who imparts the spirit to another is as the wind that blows, moved by an influence external to itself. Qui capii, ille sapit , is another, and refers to the wisdom imparted by the reception of the Afflatus, since it awakens in him a consciousness related to the universal. 32. When one life being fermented throws its life to another equally fermented, a greater perfection is produced in the patient than was before in the agent who imparts it. That is the law of progression of the Vital force; - sic itur ad astra ! 33. There is no such thing as truth absolute in nature, because she has no true conceptive vehicle; all her conceptive life is deformed and falsified, so that, as Raymond Lully says, \" the pure matter of the philosophers is not to be found on earth.\" In the application of universal principles you must have a pure conceptive medium; that is true which is conceived simple, without any heterogeneous element; thus Light in its ether is truly manifested. Given a perfectly true mirror, the reflection of objects in it would be true. Thus everything depends on the purity of the receiving power. You may find out in Plotinus how that pure matter is generated. 34. The Hermetic Art is a perfectioning of the third or lowest or the mineral life in man; and typifies throughout the celestial and Divine; see Khunrath who teaches this essentially. We live in but one life, the head life, but there are Three possible lives; i.e., there is a power of entering into Three modes of consciousness: either in the sensible, the Perceptive, or the power life; this last conjoined to the other Two makes them efficient. We have no right to be efficient In the present head life, our business is to be efficient in the Medial life in faith; then we are efficient for the life immediately Over us – the divine. Our present state is one of Inversion. 35. The analogy insisted on by Khunrath and Grassaeus in his Aquarium 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"between the Philosopher's Stone and Christ the Head Corner Stone is more than pardonable: it is a verisimilitude, and is founded on the fact that our Lord is the embodiment and representation and perfection of the highest moral and spiritual life of man, and the Stone of the Wise is the perfected lowest life, its true consumation which is mineral in its origin. Our Lord had the threefold perfection, the perfection of each life, that of the mineral, vegetable, and animal life, to use Alchemical language. The common Philosopher's Stone is only the perfection of the mineral life in us. 36. Hermetism is the magnetism of Light according to its own Law, which Law is its emanating spirit called wisdom, for it is the Wisdom. 37. Nature taken from the primal source into a will is the history of the Fall. The Art is a question put to Nature respecting the first cause, and it is an extortion from the Protean and Sphynxlike forms of the true answer. To whom, where, in what form, is the question addressed? To the stronghold of the Sphynx herself in the spirit in man. This spirit being reason-gifted can answer if rationally interrogated. 38. Our life goes forth into a line at present, it has to be taken up into a circle; in other words life has to be taken back into its first source; the serpent with his tail in his mouth is the chosen illustration of this reduction of the linear into the circular life. 39. The Walls of Troy are a figure (and were meant by the poets and traditionists to be so) of the insphering of the lower life; it is done in a great resonance. Those walls were said to be built by the music of Apollo. Apollo is that life, and it is coruscant, and in the setting free of that centre, of that coruscation, there is a harmony; what Behmen calls the Mercurius, or spirit of the Sound, is evolved; the ether round the sun is compacted and solidified. The throwing down of the Walls of this by harmony-ensphered life is the Alchemical solution; and this also is accompanied with noise, as Haly says; in another figure the roots of the mineral Tree are in the air, its summit in the earth, and when they are torn from their places a terrible sound is heard and a great fear is felt. Compare also the Chaldaic Oracles (Article Hecate, etc.). However, when this nature is born in us it asserts itself (or rather, I should say, He asserts Himself, for it is more than It) through us. (c.f., Hermes' Golden Treatise, cap. 4.) 40. The body of Brass is the impure natural-born vital spirìt. 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"41. The Hermetic Philosophy is a process of experimentation into the Universal Spirit through man; it is a development of the art by which a particular spirit (to use Vaughan's words) is allied to the universal. 42. The Vegetable spirit is the growth-causing spirit, that which is predominant in the vegetable kingdom. 43. The whole image of the Macrocosm is formed, and has consequently, its typical representation, in the Microcosm, and is evolved before the mental eye in the recreative process of the regeneration. (c.f., Nic. Flamel.) 44. In the work, wherever there is power there is a conflict : the multitudinous enemies try to rush in, the self-willed spirit endeavors to gain the mastery and offers all its lures in order to get the end for itself ; strange mystery it is. 45. I think that the soul comes into this body with the dream of its whole afterlife presented to it. And that is its destiny. This would, however, involve us in a fatalism, if it were not that we may rise above this evestrum, as Paracelsus calls it (Phil. ad Athen, B. 2, texts l823). The will is always above it, but then it influences the will that does not see beyond it, by giving that will motive; we are moved very often by it, nay, seldom pass beyond it, unless moved by God's grace (the Divine evestrum, relatively to man), and so are enabled to overcome it. The real mystery is so very wonderful, great and dose, that one cannot venture to speak of it in ordinary language. 46. The third life, the mineral or lowest life in man, brings you into contact with the Macrocosmic mineral life; for wheresoever we stand ourselves, there is the relation of the putward life to us itself formed. The Vegetable and Animal lives are higher than the Mineral life in us. 47. Those who are Hermetically regenerated in this world have given up the Head life or the animal, the rational life (not the Divine inseeing of the Celestial life), they cut themselves off from it; they pronounce a word, their life is sealed in another Covenant, they enter into our Lord's Life by a sacrifice in faith that they shall be restored ultimately by Him when He has received for Himself the Kingdom and is returned. Job's story is all a type of that. 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"48. The Alchemical symbols, phrases, metaphors, which so disguise the art are more than what they seem; they point out a reality, and were we in the spirit of their truth we should find them to be far more true literally than they are thought to be. 49. It strikes me that Behmen is the deepest writer on ontological subjects; he is not so scientifìc as the Platonists, but he is more descriptive, awakening, suggestive of truth. 50. When an entrance is effected into the Signature, then there is a clearing of the understanding to see in the Divine Wisdom the life, and to bear, by the Divine Utterance, the specific articulation of things, the knowledge of things in their roots, \"out of their essence,\" as Bohme says, \"through the principle in the sound with the voice” ( Signatura Rerum , ch. I., 1.) 51. The speech of Mind uttered into the pure Ether qualitates and specifìcates. The Ether is two- fold: the mundane, which is full of the false forms; the pure, which is not of this world but is connected with the supersensual life. 52. There is no true body but Will; it is the principle of the body -the Salt. 53. Bohme's three primary forms and his doctrines on the going forth of the Absolute Will from non- being into manifestation, are modes of expression by man of a conscious experience of the creative mystery; such words of his as hardness, enclosing, coldness, attraction, compunction ( Signa. Rerum, ch. II., 12 ) are intended to express qualities which, acting in the Spirit, become qualitative; they describe spiritual emotions both active and re-active, for such words are not mere theories or suppositions, but expressive, as far as such an instrument can be, of internal knowledge and consciousness. In the Universal, as was the case with Bohme, you must have the Universal developed in you before you can understand the Universal. 54. The whole doctrine of the ontological infolding is emanation; emanation from the superstantial Light or will. The darkness is the emanation and that which before was qualitated and flat becomes cubic by multiplication into itself. It is Mathesis becoming geometric. 55. If you find the Wisdom, and, coming out in the Spirit Of Wisdom, look 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"into the world, then you may see as Solomon did the nature and virtues of all things. The Philosopher, says Sendivogius, in a very eloquent passage, \"looks not out on nature with the eyes of common men.\" 66. Alchemy is the art of fermenting the human vital spirit in order to purify it and finally to dissolve it, so that the principle be reconstructed through a regeneration. 57. There is a dualism or relation of two, in all things, plus the one and the three. The great principle of the number seven is a Rest from the ferment or action of the Vitalising or Divine principles. 58. When speaking of the four elements, Alchemists refer to the four elements of the Universal Ether. This Ether is a quintessence of those very four principles, which they call elements. It is the Quintessence of both worlds. 59. The Divine Light, the Essence of Gold, is hidden in the self-begotten Life. This life of ours, instead of administering to the Divine Life, appropriates it. 60. The mineral soul or the lowest form of life in us, when first seen by introspection, is as a dark vapour, “ monstrum, horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum \" -it is the Augean Stable the cleansing of which involved Hercules in so much labour. 61. Saturn or the self-willed life can only be overcome in the process by satiation; he must be given from without plenty \" of the honey of the bees,\" the aurific seed, the Rational Light. He first of all entraps the Light, and then he longs for more to feed that centre which he has entrapped, and just as a seed which has drawn light from the sun longs for more and so grows till it bursts out of the Saturnine husk into a flower, and soon no longer grows for itself but for another generation and becomes transmuted, so the selfish Saturnine life in man when once it has passed into its new life, or rather admitted it, assimilates that life into itself and becomes itself transmuted. 62. As man was the Quintessence of the whole creation, so woman was the Quintessence of man - the love-spirit was in her. The whole process of the Mystery was intended to purify the impure vital atmosphere which 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"surrounds each individual life. The action of Mesmerism is a very external way - an imitation of the Divine Art of the separation of which Paracelsus speaks. It solves the bond between the spirit and its corporeal media for the moment, by the perpendicular or vertical passes. Clairvoyants perceive this atmosphere, and the deformities with which it is full; all the thoughts and desires of life are imaged there. Its density or lightness is the cause of the darkness or brightness which may be seen in men. 63. There are two Causes and one Mother in the Work; the Mystery of this is shadowed out in the Myth of Oedipus. It is shut up in those strange allegories of earlier Greek life. Qui capii, ille sapit . 64. The Law of Divine Manifestation is expressed in those striking words of Bohme in the Sig. Rerum , Ch. II., 68 : \"An Eternal Will arises in the No THING to introduce the No THING into Something, that the Will might feel and find and behold itself.\" C.f., the Enigma \" Omnia in omnibus \" in Khunrath. This is the order imaged out in the Hermetic Work, which is, in fact, an imitation of the Divine. 65. The first-fruits, though perfectly real, should not be accepted as permanent, - the Artist should not stop there; they must be sacrificed for the sake of the promise they contain, would he fulfill the Divine purpose and not his own. There is a good illustration of this in the latter part of that curious little hook, The Hermetic Wedding . 66. True Knowledge is experimental contact of mind with mystery; it is when the mind enters into the Universal consciously; it returns, as it were, into its principle and knows itself in its principle, and there is an efflux of life. It is not merely an experience such as one might have in receiving a blow; there is a consequence in it. The true Adepts had this knowledge and its fruits. Ordinary men only touch a surface: they don’t realise; their life is not multiplied into the absolute fountain of being. Many of the Alchemists only saw theoretically; some of them entering into the medial sphere; the Paradisiacal life inferred the higher and deeper. 67. The Salt is the voluntary substance, and is bound up in the lowest region, the generative mineral life, and must be transplanted or drawn up into the medial life (Troy in the old analogy is that citadel where Apollo keeps his cattle, Mercury steals them and afterwards sacrifices them); the Salt thus transplanted becomes Light and grows; and, in growing this 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"sensibly affects the whole connate or surrounding spirit, ferments it, and moves it to contrition. By contrition I mean a real contrition, when the soul through that Light perceives the evil and deviation of the whole individual human life from the Law of Light from the Logos. Speculation on these deep points is rather dangerous, for Light must not be played with. A reverential spirit must tone enquiries of this kind; and even then they are exhaustive of the spirit, because in talking in a theoretic way one draws from oneself and not from the open Fountain; it is the Light without the Love, - it is like mesmerism by will instead of by relation. 68. True Alchemy (not that which the world has run after without finding) is related to Theosophy on its physical side; it concerns that change in the circulatory system of the blood to which St. Martin and Eckartshausen, among others of the same highly experimental school, allude, showing how the change is wrought by reiterated contritions absorbing the sensuous medium and carrying back the purer conscious sans of light to its first life in God. 69. The Christian scheme is the bringing of the whole of our life into the Sonship by regeneration; ' it is an eternal marriage-union between man and God in Christ, as is hinted by St. Paul and in the Book of Revelation. No doubt the state of it, when thoroughly achieved, is one of perfect beautitude; the mind then revels as it were in the appreciation of its Maker, its Source. Man is so a child of God, regenerated or born again as an offspring of his own will, given up in passivity to the Divine Will. It is the death to sin with a new birth awakened in us, and until that takes place we know little or nothing of the sinfulness of this life. 70. It is by emotion that mind is moved into matter. Emotion is a mid-point between the two; conscience strikes upon the self-life, and, when it does so, effectually ferments it and evolves from it a third form of life, a new birth of life. 71. All qualities (every adjective form) are first in the letter, the grounded form, the mathematical flat surface; then in the intellectual, that which understands that; then in the emotional that which feels and as it were has it; then in the expression of the emotional it becomes sensible and so materialized - for the efflux or first origin of matter is upon the sensible experience; hence, the strange nature of the Hermetists and of Bohme about the Sulphur, the Salt and the Mercury; the water, the air, the fire, etc., relates to principles rather than qualities: in the spirit they become 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"qualities. Thought qualitates spirit, and spiritual experiences bring the qualities produced into manifestation, into esse from posse . 72. All is held in potentiallty in Will. The Alchemists say that, in the process, there is a point of passivity, where there is no attraction but rather an indifference to both the life and the death; then the Artist must look to his Work, and seek to stir up the Motion; this we learn in the language of the older Masters, that when Vulcan appears in the same altar with Minerva the conjunction is ominous. This means that all the desire of life is towards the Wisdom-life, that pure, good, beautiful, passionless life: of itself it’s needs nothing, but if it is stirred it is taken; what takes it is the self-will. The whole of this mystery is a translation of the consciousness; for there is a life behind the consciousness, Present consciousness lives in and is drawn out to sense; it may be, it should be, thrown backwards, nay upwards, into its First Source. 73. The Philosophic Matter is an excruciated ens of Light; a Light extracted through anguish from Life. The process goes over and over again, for we could not bear the birth in our own strength; it is a successive giving up of itself to be bettered on the part of Will. The principle of it is wonderfully beautiful when one gets a glimpse of it, but it is almost too sacred, and impinges so strongly on the Spirit-life that I don't think you can think into such spheres of life without moving them, or being moved by them. 74. Everything is in Will. All in the beginning is Will; it is the foundation of everything, and is everything; it is the only true substance of body. It subsists first in one will, then in two wills, and exists in the third; it then becomes a self-assertion. 75. All the false sulphurs (by sulphurs I mean forms) of the mundane life require to be purified, nay, perhaps extirpated, in order that the medium for manifestation of the Divine Light may be simple and pure. The human spirit has to die to everything that it now lives to, and lastly to its own identity, in order to become a simple receptacle of and magnet for the Divine Seed. When it re-arises it is a true manifestation, reflex and image of the Divine; that is the condition of the highest regeneration. All true religion in this life is a preparation of the Will for this final work. 76. We have no business whatsoever to speak THE NAME. If it should speak in us it will work its own change in us (c.f., St. Martin's 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Correspondence, letter 30, p. 107); that is how it spoke in our Lord's baptism, when the Voice came, \"How I have both glorifìed my name and I will glorify it again.\" It would seem as if our Lord when He prayed \" Father, glorify thy Name,\" and received that answer, needed new strength by the utterance of the NAME; hence He introduced that prayer by the declaration \"Now is my soul troubled.\" 77. \"Take that matter which is gold,\" says Eirenaeus, \"and throw it into Mercury, such a Mercury as is bottomless, whose centre it can never find but by discovering its own\"; in finding the magical earth in yourself, in your own centre, you find that which is in the air or the vegetable life, that pure earth which commences the Regeneration, the medial life, ( nascitur in aere terra magica; in ethere clarifìcatur ). The mineral earth belongs to the lower life and to the centre of the globe. (See St. Martin's Theos. Correspondence, p. 117.) 78. Wisdom is nowhere so well described as in the Book of Wisdom; it is a pure exemplar from the first Light or Life, showing man what he ought to be, and offering to conform him to it. The standard is very high and arduous, nothing but entire self-devotion is of any use even to begin with. Its end is that so-called annihilation bringing back into the Nothing which is before all things. You see it holds such a strong contrast in hand, the perfection of the Law of Light, and the defection of humanity; just that state described by Job: \"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee; therefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes”. This Divine Wisdom in us has to be born over and over again; it is an ultimate in the procedure in human restoration. 79. The life acts through the sensuous and sensible spirit in the blood; it is all to be taken up into, I suppose, the will to cause another and new life to grow out of its death. If you magnetize a person, he is elevated into a purer atmosphere instantly; the natural tendency at once is to a purification; it dissolves the sensuous medium and opens the consciousness to the Divine life; you may corrupt it by introducing forcibly upon the patient a bad will, but it is not, naturally, easy to do so. 80. Out of the ashes of this present sensuous spirit arises the Phoenix. 81. There is a war in the Work between the self-will and the Universal Will, and all the faculties and desires are engaged on one side or the other; 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the effort of the Universal Will is to draw them into its service by fìrst destroying them, and then reproducing them in a transmuted form. 82. The Solar Tincture (Tinctura Solaris) is the Aurific Light. 83. The physical problem as Kirchberger calls it ( Theos. Correspondence , p. 168) is the making visible the invisible spirit. Verbum invisible fiat palpabile et germinabit ut radix ; it is a taking of the infinite Light-nature into bound by hypostatic multiplication of its shadow or image. 84. Lives as long as they are superficies don't create; they are merely principles. 85. The Philosopher's Stone is a real entity produced by spiritual generation; it is a real ens of light; it is both objective and subjective - an actuality as well as a theory. 86. Living in the Second Principle means living the Paradisaical life; they all lived in it - under the Cross; the heart life below the arms which, when extended, give a Cross, represents this, and is this. 87. The Universal Will being represented as agent dissolves the false forms in the self-will represented as patient. The great Salt Sea (Wisdom, the Universal Will) dissipates the impure sulphurs (desires, phantasms) in the individual will as the strokes of the sun's rays dissipate the darkness of night. 88. There are three microcosmic centres in man, - the eye of the Divine, animal rational head life; the heart of the celestial medial vegetable life; the lumbar region of the inferior mineral life. The universal matter is obtainable at the focus of either centro. 89. The true manifestation of the law of Light is what is to be sought; the place of its manifestation is in the soul. \"There is room for the image also in the circumlucid place. Every way to the unfashioned soul stretch the reins of fire” (See \" Chaldaic Oracles \" and Stanley's Hist. Phil .) 90. In the Philosophical dissolution the body, soul and spirit are separate; the body lies without any breath; the other two are united to it as by a thread, and this continues until the refixation takes place. Through every stage of the process of re-generation, through every stage of progress, the 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"same principles are maintained in operation until the assimilation is perfected and the Divine Will is all. There is no defection then; the selfhood has nothing to deface, nothing to deform. Many modern metaphysicians have taken the first ground, their starting point, from the Mystics; I mean Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Kant, and others of kindred mind. They worked hard on the margin of intellectual intuition of truth. Kant never got beyond or behind it, but stood on and ranged round the negative margin. Fichte and Schelling broke through into the ontological, the Absolute ground, seeing but without experiencing. Jacob Böhme here transcended them. He was in the Experience, but they transcended him in scientific intuition. Oken's case was different; he appears to have had an inspiration into the science of created nature. Böhme saw into the uncreated and felt it; the arising Life was in him consciously. 91. Kirchberger ( Theos. Correspondence, p. 236 ) thought that \"the Divine Will makes use of the human voice as an organ for conducting the Light, through the fire.\" It strikes me that he is right in this; the fire here is our chaotic will in potentiality, it is the basis of our microcosmic re-creation. 92. I am always surprised that these Mystics refer so little to the Psalms; with the exception of Arndt there are none who seem to recognize their surpassing depth of Divine experience. 93. The Key to the Work, or into another life, the Key of the House of David, is obtained from the desire of the lower life, the generative, the fallen life, opening up into the heart life, or the medial life, or the celestial life, or the vegetable life, by extasis. 94. The strength of the attraction of that which is above (the feminine principle, -Wisdom, - the heart life), forces, draws, attracts, as by a magnet, the self-willed source upwards, so that this latter becomes transmuted into a passive feminine principle. The draw up is sudden and as at an instant; a sudden force of admiration does it; it is love which attracts. Nothing else could move that principle from its self-conscious centre into self-oblivion. The seed of this life, the paternal principle, is drawn up. As the feminine spirit is the cause of the Fall, so is it in an advanced stage, you know, the cause of the restoration when it advances up there. When the attraction is placed above instead of below a restoration of what was lost takes place and more also; if Paradise regained were merely the old Paradise regained, why, then, the Fall would be a thing to be wondered at and deplored; but seeing that it promises in the restoration a much greater 127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"good (for the second Adam is greater than the first) may we not regard it as in accordance with the \"eternal purpose, purposed in Christ Jesus, our Lord ?\" 95. St. Martin has a curious remark respecting the foundation of the two Testaments. He asserts it to consist \"in the true pronunciation of the two great names \" ( Theo, Corr., p. 244 ); this involves more than his words convey to common sense; as showing what really and originally the Old and New Testaments are founded on, namely, on the revealed utterance of the life of God in man. Out of that all minor details follow and belong, and all the particulars that spring out of that Universal, all who have been on that original ground, agree; they corroborate one another; the New Testament is a development and fulfillment of the promise of the Old, and with that fulfillment gives another promise. 96. All religions are founded on prior revelations, but Polytheism is distinguished from Monotheism by its deviation, from the central principle. 97. As the World is diverse, so is the manifestation of the Spirit diverse; and so powers subordinate to God are evolved. Of this we have a remarkable illustration in those words of comment made by our Lord on the language of David : \"I have said ye are gods, if (says our Lord) ye called them gods unto whom the Word of God came.\" Where that Word comes there is power in an individual; the danger is the tendency in such gifted beings to set up self-centres. This is the key to the philosophy of the Second Commandment as the practical result of the violation of the First. A graven image means a vocal utterance carved into the understanding spirit which conceives it by the desire of life; the image lives in the heart and the whole individual worships it, and endeavors to conform to it; that sort of graven image may be carried out magically into material forms and objectively worshipped, and this we see becomes more and more weakened the further it departs from its source till it becomes a mere dead representation - common idolatry; the ancient prophets impugned both, but the danger and sin of the latter is as nothing compared to those of the former, for in it was vitality and efficacy. 98. The Initiated moved one another on by words of power. The Masons grasp this, but have lost the Magic Key, which was so carefully prepared by the anonymous author of the Tractatus Aureus (see Museum Hermeticum, edit. 1649 p. 45 ) to open the door into the Hermetic garden; 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"they want the words, which are only to be found by seeking them in the subjective, the fundamental life, from which they are as far out as the tools they use. The true tools also may be found on the way in; they will be given one after another as they are wanted, i.e., the double Triangle and triple Tau, etc. 99. These and kindred principles are sacred in their originals; in their ultimates from the centre they are not so, they are celestial and outward; the celestial as well as the ultimate may be used. There is not that sacredness in the outward tools: they are representatives of those that are in The Recess of Light, though they are meant for sacred use, and are so far consecrated on account of purpose. 100. The outward form of Masonry is too absurd to be perpetuated were it not for a certain secret response of common sense to the original mystery; so it is with the acceptance of all religious systems: it is based in faith, and faith looks to the invisible. 101. The perfection of each man is to submit to have his fundamental faith, which is his individual Logos, perfectly elaborated -i.e., fermented - so as to transmute the whole being, so that the whole body, soul and spirit may be saved in it. Few have ever perfected this, though there were doubtless degrees of it; the birth of this life prevents the complete work: it is not intended to be completed till the time Comes. The danger of diving into the mystery of life through Alchemical seekings is that it tempts you to break the seals upon the hook of life artificially in order to hasten the work, instead of waiting Gods will and pleasure about it. He will hasten up all at last quickly enough. The Hermetists themselves always war against over-haste. Norton says, \" Haste is the Devils part.\" There is a swiftness in the self-willed magnet working powerfully and to destruction if suffered to do so before its time. Ripley warns against this under the similitude of red poppies - the work gets all burnt up and the artist has to begin over again. Nevertheless in every mistake there is a lesson for future guidance. 102. The Crown, to use Böhme’s and de St. Martins phrase, is the Logos. The whole of the Divine purpose appears to be to bring the self-willed opposition into subjection through man's consent and operation, in order that the original fallen body of the will in Lucifer may become a ground and body to the Divine instead of being apostate. The scheme is wonderful, and appears perfectly marvellous the moment the mind enters into perception of it; that is, the value of man. The body, the really 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"efficient body of the Will, is at present allienated from and in rebellion, as it were experimentally, against its first source. 103. Engelbrecht lived like Swedenborg, in the visionary sphere, and with no education of the intellect, had, it strikes me, the less gauge for truth. One reads his writings without any sense of value, except such as they might be to his own mind, and to such as himself. Böhme’s mind was on quite another ground; it was altogether withdrawn from surfaces, which in him were objective instead of subjective; he looked to them with a light that penetrated and comprehended them. There is a certain truth in the analogical sphere, but it is only relative. The wise called it the Regio phantastica ; all the true Hermetists knew it, and valued it only for the derived light of its essence, not for any light it gave them; it was as a pabulum for them, but only when deprived of all phantasmagoric form. All those little peep-shows are shadows of it, and no doubt children enjoy these things at fairs because their spirits are near this source. A deep intellect will not stay in these spheres, it will be drawn deeper by gravitation to the primary sources of life. Some persons, however, such as perhaps Engelbrecht, misconceive this Evester, as Paracelsus calls it, and having a simple understanding see things pretty truly if they continue faithful of purpose without much self- desire; it is self-desire that adulterates. Vaughan, the Welshman, very elegantly depicts the play of that ether. In Böhme, as in the higher regenerate men, the body became as the iron in the forge, no longer visible as before, but penetrated through and swallowed up with the Light. On that principle, by the bye, pictures of the Ascension and Transfìguration should be painted ; they should paint Light, making the central body of the Light stronger than the outside. Like the eye and its iris, a body can only become invisible through excess of light from within it. It is by the shutting up of ours in its centre that we become sensibly visible to sense; it only emanates from the focus of the eye, and it is that light thrown in to fìnd its own centre and origin which awakens that centre at last and causes it to coruscate. 104. When the archetypal Light is perceived, it burns up all anterior manifestations, images and representations, all that is not of itself; it perceives itself alone, for it is objective and subjective both; it is Truth. There is nothing alien in it or possible to it, for it burns up all that is alien, transmuting all that is not combustible into itself. 105. De St. Martin says, \"Numerical numbers are merely the bark of 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"things,\" ( p. 298, Corres .), and outer nature is the bark of them as the tradition of Scripture is the bark of the inner law. My notion of numbers considered theosophically is that they represent, and are the order of the development of, the Divine Law in actual creative operation, and that they are known in their arithmetical forms of addition and subtraction (of which multiplication and division are developments) through their personal representation in theurgic art, by which spirit is added to spirit and multiplied as offspring, producing points, planes, cubes, which being again conjoined, have their confluence in materiality. The mystic Tetractys of Pythagoras was thus obtained; the source, as he called it, of ever-flowing Nature; such an ens was the basis of the philosophic stone , a metaphysico- chemical birth, emanating according to the creative law, proving itself doubly, triply, by a realisation of the first represented will; and this is known in Regeneration, individually proven and proving all. 106. All members that work here for the natural work, work also for the super-essential. All the organs of the senses are brought to bear against the principle of sense or the sensuous medium in the blood; then the hands are taught to war and the fingers to fight, and all natural secretion is superseded by super-essential hypherphysical exsudation and tears; for when the connate spirit is deprived of its understanding spirit, as is imaged in the Iliad after the death of Patroclus, and in the grief of Hercules for the loss of Hylas, life flows away, until by self-exhaustion it rallies from a new centre. 107. Grammar has its foundation in operations of the Spirit, of which will is the substantive or noun, love the qualitative adjective form; their union coming into self-expression is the verb affirmative, I am. 108. The sensual medium must in the work be brought to its pivot, to its last ens. The residuum from this medium supplies body to the regenerate soul; after that the soul has passed under its Cross. De St. Martin says in allusion to this that \"the earth is the crucible for souls as well as bodies,\" - see Tableau Naturel, vol. II., p. 230 . Also the Smaragdine Table - \"The power is integral if it be turned into earth;\"this earth becomes the punctum saliens of the Divine Cross which before was its punctum . 109. Festina lente, Ne quid nimis , are sayings very applicable to the work, and very important in conducting it, and that whether in its higher or lower form. It may seem strange to say so, but too much haste to be good or 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"perfect involves a self-willed action which defeats the end; it is the duty of man's will to follow God's Will as He, according to His time and measure, opens the way. Be not righteous overmuch, says Solomon, showing that we should not exceed the capacity which is given; if we do, it gives power to the contrary principle to re-act upon the over-run. (Note. - The action of the self-will on the soul which exaggerates its religious life may be seen in the history of men, Jewish and Christian, in spiritual pride, in contempt of others, in morbid self-anatomy, in want of charity or allowance for others, in the odium theologicum , whether they who show these qualities were called Pharisees or Katharoi or Devotes or Puritans.) 110. The whole work is an action of agent on patient, and the re-action of patient, advancing, on agent. The work is gradual, yet always progressive; each fermented spirit advances upon its origin. Desire constricts the essence of what it desires and so draws matter about the image of its object. 111. The lucidity and terseness of even Bacon's style if turned from the a posteriori to the a priori ground would be equally lucid and perspicuous to those who discovered the latter, but would be eminently abstruse and involved and mystical to such as are of a merely perceptive mind cognisant of sensibles, because the natural understanding and language are inadequate to express things belonging to absolute truth; they were never framed to it. The language of the spirit itself only can clearly express and reveal its own life. Nevertheless the more the inner becomes elaborated by thought through the organisation, the more intelligible can its light be made by natural language to the natural understanding. 112. It is true that all inner principles are evolved out-wardly, but they are thrown into deviation in the course of evolution by the halting, obstructive movements of the law of individual life. 113. Kirchberger says for de St. Martin ( Theos. Corresp., p. 359 ) that \"there is no true government but aTheocracy.\" This is a great truth, but the social surface to bear a theocratic government must first be coordinate; the World's surface can only be governed by the centre from which it is derived - that is, its king; and if the Divine Centre moves into a superficial dominion it immediately proceeds to re-create and prepare for the dethronement of the Old centre by dissolution of the corrupt surface. A perfect law is quite unfit for an imperfect community in immediate form; it 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"works by intermediate degrees of completeness before it attains power to work through to regenerate without destruction of that which, taken up progresssively, is valuable (see de St. M's Reply , p. 364 ). 114. People in whom the Mars or Venus property is dominant, especially when they both co-exist, are drawn very closely in consciousness to the vortex of life - the Sol principle; their knowledge is by experience, not perception or intuition, which are the property of Mercury and Jupiter, which can enunciate far more clearly than the mere emotional spheres, but cannot feel as well, or realise without the voluntary dominance of Saturn and Luna. These supply efficience to their respective light and life. 115. De St. Martin found an entrance into the centre of the substantial life which every creature is seeking, and in the perfect law of which all who have truly entered and known that centre agree. It is in the identity of this revelation in every individual, that this agreement arises. For this truth is at once a unity and a universal. 116. Kirchberger was drawn to and worked about the intellectual imagination of the inner life, seeking means of further entrance perhaps, at least sometimes, rather than to become integrated or made anew and converted wholly into the Light he saw. This is the snare of most intellectual seekers; they desire to dive deeply by the one ray of intellect rather than to transfuse its converting light and essence through the darkness of the selfhood on which it shines. It is true that high revelations may be obtained in that way, intuitions even, but without clothing or realisation, unless the spirit of such a seeker returns before it is too late to take up the life which was born with the Light, and which it has left behind in the forgetful enjoyment of its own rcsearches. 116. Intellectual seekers get quickly deeper, but have more to overcome. Seekers, who are in the Divine order of Love, who are passive, are worked at every surface of the Spirit, and this takes time; for doing is more tedious than seeing, but then it is surer, it takes up everything under God's Will. 117. Everyone can find in himself at moments the true centre, if only the thought dives deep enough, and so long as he is there every particular truth will be perceived in its widest acceptation; because without hindrance there is nothing to stop thought there except the law of thought itself. Thus de St. Martin's mind expatiated broadly and freely, asserted universal truths in reply to the particular enquiry of his friend; so he answers him 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"and does not: he answers questions and explodes them. And so in the Hermetic process there is an inquisition into life, in which every question is solved, thrown into solution, and a new basis furnished for further enquiry; and here every solution is a convertive process and progress in entity and hypostatic relation. When I ask you a question or you me, the doing so does not change, though it affects, our life; but there it does both, because the solution enters into the spirit of the enquirer: it is intimate, alchemical; it is light dissolving darkness until there is no more darkness or shadow of doubt. You must understand that the intellect is the enquirer and, as individual, is sceptical. The Universal Reason condescends to answer it when not self-seeking and too proud to know. To the true seeker after truth in humility, not in pride, it responds. Kant saw that, Hegel saw it, Fichte knew it, Schelling saw it, Böhme knew it and proved it by his experienced in-seeing whereby he became it. 118. It requires Light to throw light upon Light; darkness looking in and looming only darkens. It is the blind leading the blind, or worse than that; it is a blind man dragging about his dog instead of his dog dragging him. Hence by reading St. Pauls Epistles in the atmosphere of the higher Mystics, more knowledge of his meaning, more insight into his depths, is given than can be drawn from any professed commentators. The Theosophic light opens him at a much wider plane of thought than the Theological. 119. In that dream your mind was carried back into its ether; the etherial consciousness brought into relation with the Universal Ether. That ether is the omnia in omnibus of the Hermetic Riddle. What we have is a scrap of that ether shut in at our birth-conception. All qualities are in it and colour it. 120. The first vegetative life is green, it arises with hope; it is hope, the first aspiration to something better, to progress and improvement; it is a beautiful principle, the sensation of it on such as are permitted in consciousness to enter into it is blessed. The purple color is its ripened Life; it is the benedicta viriditas of the old masters ( Song of Sol., cap.II ). 122 \"Man is the servant and interpreter of Nature,\" says Bacon, and truly, so long as he goes outwardly and away from himself and from God to find knowledge; but when he returns within according to the Divine Ordinance and Law of Reason, he finds himself no longer the mere “ servant and 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"interpreter \" but that he has a capacity in his own principle of being and life, when allied to God, to become, next Him, revealer and master. 122. The only objection that can be urged rationally to the a priori investigation of nature is the lapse of the human soul, the fall away of it into selfhood, which has defaced the image, so that it no longer reflects the truth nor perceives it until it has been regenerated; and so far the objection is valid, but not beyond. The a priori method is the true one for the discovery of the fìrst truths; the difficulty of the method does not invalidate its superiority; when found it proceeds to prove itself a posteriori by efficient procedure, as it were by what is commonly called miracle; and this, the inductive philosophy or method never can arrive at, since it goes further and further out, and finds its strength in remoteness from the casual source. The subjective can prove itself, has proved itself, to the objective; the objective never can prove itself by originating any effects. 123. The whole of the self-included vaporous vehicle of the soul must be evaporated before any truth is evolved. The vaporous vehicle is the maternal principle in the conception, it obscures the pure paternal light of life -the generative light, in order to bring it out into sense. The birth into this life is a continuous image of the Fall; the Fall was not at first sensible, but spiritual; the principle of the Fall is a long way back behind its effects. 124. The spirit of Nature is all imagination, ideality, fancy. She wraps herself about with what you call aromal essences, aromal emanations, in order to realize her imaginings. Nature is a personality whenever it is included in particular, and also when regarded universally it is the same in the being of the orb soul. She is sometimes more at one time than at another in a phantastic state, when there is more power given her from the Central Source to work with, as in earthquakes and convulsions. Then she makes beautiful scenery, and throws about her shaping essence gracefully to be clothed at those junctures with the material that is in process of reformation. She enjoys re-constructing in the World, just as she does in us when the constructing organ is called into play. The embellishing spirit goes with the constructive, though not always in the same degree; that is highest and strongest when she has most supply of life. Of course, there is a sense of beauty in Nature or else the world would be ugly. 125. Children have the growth spirit in them (the vegetale spirit which is 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"more phantastic than the animal) and therefore they imagine more freely and with less resistance from consciousness of the actual. They are not so entirely included in the circle of life and circulation. When that is completed it shuts them more in, and growth upwards stops; the intercourse is then not so free with the spirit of Nature; it is imprisoned in the self-consciousness, and self becomes the magnet. 126. Böhme surpassed the Neo-Platonists in his revelations of the Life Centre; of this they delivered down the principles scientifically in accordance with the natural reason and scholar-like knowledge of all contemporary literature, and of Eastern philosophy and tradition; besides which they underwent an Initiation perfected through long ages of experience; so that their theosophy bears the same relation to Böhme's as the astronomy of Ptolemy would to that of Newton. It was not their practice to declare the inner experience of the Mystae and Teleioi ; they chiefly confined themselves to the psychological investigation and experiments. 127. Weight is the analog of Will. 128. There are two magnets in man, i.e., two wills contending for man: the one universal, the other particular; the one related to the Divine Centre, the other to the self centre. Therefore these two contend for the soul. The Hermetic picture of the two dogs, the Corascene dog and that of Armenia, as they sometimes are called, is an illustration of this, as is also the allegory of the Duellum between the two knights; in the common life they are not in contact, they are remote from each other, the one, that related to the self-will, being carried out through the senses; the other, the good life, being hidden and requiring to be sought out by the will and desire of man turned towards it. 129. When the medial life draws the hidden Central light, there is a tremendous Central action now, i.e., in this life, we are upside down. The Sulphur, the pure light of life, is bound down in the inferior mineral region of life, and has to be drawn forth and transplanted into the medial region before it can grow and become manifest. It is brought up like a graft, \" verbum invisible fiat palpabile et germinabit ut radix .\"You see, the Central hidden light (there's the mystery) is hidden in the voÌuntary contrariation which is a salt and a poison to it, and therefore Sendivogius says that Saturn (i.e., Will) has the Key to the prison where Sulphur lies bound; for that which Will has bound, Will only can unbind. 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 130. Supposing I have a will that wishes to loosen your will, or rather the will that binds your life individually. I throw its purpose into your mind, and so ferment the whole including spirit of your life that it, the former, opens, corrupts, dissolves, and so lets loose the light of which the latter was begot, i.e., the light which comes into every soul born into the world. When this light is let loose, it shines forth with a sudden coruscation feeding on the surrounding ether which constitutes the atmosphere of the life, as is described in the midnight sun seen by Apuleius when he was initiated by the Goddess Isis. (You are always taken down there by spiritual guides; it is never human initiation, that). This Will being so brought forth (in point of fact, the Olden Bough - 6th Aeneid - has to be found first) returns after transplantation to complete the work which is begun for the perfecting of the soul life, which is :— There is an action and re-action of the opposite poles (the two magnets before mentioned) to perfect one another, or rather each by the other, in the overcoming the negative law, the evil, the selfhood, into which the original sin resulted. The action of the two on one another resembles that of an acid and alkali, beginning in a violent effervescence and ending in coalescence under a third form, so as Ripley (\"revived \") says, through Eirenaeus, \"the Corascene dog and the bitch of Armenia, after all their snarling and biting, brought forth a sky-colored whelp.\" (This colour is the colour of Wisdom.) 131. When light meets light there is true self-perception, and man begins to know and to hate and to rectify himself and desire rectification. 132. To utter from spirit-suggestions is a fearful thing; spirits get footing in the life through utterance ; every time strengthening, it makes place for them, as it were, by vacuity of self-will, and, there being no substitution from the Divine, they take possession of the soul and plague it subsequently into submission. 133. By music, the human spirit is passed back into its original sources; the sound makes a concave in the recipient life; it is formative in the ether; matter arranges itself geometrically in accordance with the forms educed. 134. The Vulcan of the Alchemists is Motion. Why Vulcan is represented as lame in the Myths is because motion or action in this life is halting; it runs after something which it never catches; it runs in a line, keeping on without returning, circularly into its own principle; in this life it is not 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"meant to do so, for nothing here contains its own principle in itself. Vulcan is not the fire, the ignis Philosophorum, but the stirrer up of the fire. 135. The fìrst step in this Philosophy is to create motion in the spirit. The Vulcan or Faber is the instrument of the motive agent - the mind. 136. The spirit freedworks by itself, by its own law, \" ignis et Azoth tibi sufficiunt \"the wonder must be to see it working its miracle. 137. We are all compacted in a certain petrifaction, i.e., life in each is as a stone in its fìrst being; therefore they say \"take that stone\", meaning take life as it is and ferment it, that is by another life, which will dissolve and kill it as well as itself; both will be reproduced in a third. 138. There is this difference between fermentation and ordinary generation, that the one is exalted in its result, the other keeps level and equal with its offspring: spiritual generation is according to the fermentative law; by fermentation of its own light it keeps on rising, until it reaches the perfection of its law. It is an ascending, not a descending, process. 139. The Divine Art evolves various states of life and develops various possibilities, offering many objects and allurements to the will. And as whatever the will enters into or draws to, becomes realized, therefore the will should aim singly at the highest good lest it create for itself idols. The creating itself into a being is the evil. This is what Lucifer did; he did not know before he tried the experiment that the stirring up of the Central fìre in his Will would inflame the vehicle of his life, and burn up the ether which was Heaven. 140. \"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you\", said our Lord. This, in its application to the Hermetic Art, and when the principle governs the seeker, is really the shortest as well as the truest road to the attainment of all that is promised or can be looked for. Everything is in the perfected Corner Stone, when the whole torch of life, regeneration is brought up into the head-consciousness, what they call in the north . The life is dislocated now; what ought to be up is down; it wastes itself. The Efficient must be regained. That is, it is to be related to mind and not to the generative life. 141. If you seek a finite end first, i.e., before you seek the Universal - the 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Kingdom of God - which you are ordered to do, you will have to give up the former at every stage, if a right seeker; and unless you are wicked, and steal the first fruits of the spirit's offerings, all sorts of gifts are offered: you may stop in any of them: if you do, you commit idolatry. It is against God's ordinance; that is the real truth as expressed in the 1st and 2nd Commandments especially; though it is a breach of all, in the higher spiritualistic sense. If the human Will creates itself into an entity there is the second death; a miserable existence is created and made permanent. We were made mortal in order to save us from that, \"now, therefore, lest he put forth his hand and take of the Tree of Life and eat and live for ever,\" etc. ( Gen . III. ) If the immortality is made in the self-will, it is contrary to the Universal Will: the result is a wrathful biting life, hopeless. I don't much like looking into that kind of thing. 142. What is it that Nature strives to gain through man, because creation has lapsed into it? I suppose it is an escape from vacuity into entity, from the seeming and shadow into reality. There is no human misery which can compare to that. 143. Self-knowledge is the first contact of consciousness in the ground of life. 144. The First Matter is not to be found on earth, as the philosophers say; you must go back into the original of life from which it springs; go back in consciousness. It is immediately antecedent to the first consciousness. How beautifully Plotinus describes that generation of the First Matter as a recessure of reason behind itself into the indefinite intermediate between reason and the Absolute. This is merely the metaphysic of it. It is never realised so, it is merely intelligible so to the highest reason, for this First Matter thus presents itself as the extreme of bound and definiteness reverting to non-being. 1 45. The Hermetic Process is a regular inquisition into life. There is motion present with interrogation. Generally speaking the descriptions of the Matter as it appears to the eye of mind rcgardant of its own first source, the whole process, all the descriptions, relate to the one universal entity of life, the omnia in omnibus before manifestation and individuality, the thing of which you may assert everything; Proteus. 146. There is a spirit-man within the natural man and his work is to move 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"the Ether. 147. When the natal bond is broken, the Elias spirit is born and his work is to prepare for something higher. This is the analog of the Work revealed in Holy Scripture, just as the Stone is the analog of the Chief Corner Stone. 148. As the Divine Art works in and with the Universal Spirit, the Proteus mentioned above is mechanical as well as alchemical and uses instruments as well as vessels; as the heart and brain are its vessels, so are the hand and eye its instruments and vessels also, the eye particularly. Every member is in short working for the end proposed to fulfill the law of the head, the direction, I mean, given by the head; without taking all the powers and appliances you narrow the view of this art, which comprehends everything wanted here on earth analogically. 149. The reason why there are so many seeming contradictions in the descriptions given of the First Matter in its manifestations, is that the things said of it are transmutable adjective forms, which may become one another, and what they are at one moment they change from at another. Virgil alluded to this in the advice to Aristeus as to the mode in which he should arrest and bind Proteus (c.f., Vaughan's Aula Lucis, pp. 15-16 ). 150. When the consciousness is opened into rapport with the spiritual spheres, it comes into relationship with multiplicity of being and beings of good or evil character according to the state in which the vital spirit is within the blood. If a person in the inner life came suddenly into this outer life, and his senses were awakened into perception of the vastness and variety of things, he would be astonished at what he saw; just so would be the case with one coming into relation with the manifold world within. 151. As is Nature to God, so is the outward Bible in my opinion to the inner: the letter to the spirit, the historical to the ontological. When St. Paul says \" the letter killeth \" he means that the living letter of the law is too powerful a test for man's spirit. The Law of Eternal Justice cannot be met but by the Mediatorial Sacrifice from which the new spirit arises. I don't like to say much here; it seems to me presumptuous rather. I half see it. It is talking too theoretically of the Christian Love which reconciles, of the Humility which was deeper than the pride which caused the Fall. We cannot imagine of the depths of that suffering, that utter self-abandonment. 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"152. The vision and experience of the inner life is the game to all who enter into it, after they have passed the phantasmagoric region and so far unriddled the sphynx of this world as to enter into its solution, i.e., in its dissolved essence which is the mercury of the Philosophers, Proteus. Thus Aristaeus went to Proteus to learn how he could get on after he had lost all his bees, all the faculties of his soul, with the generative life. 153. Nature reduced to the extremity of her last unit or monad turns upon her axis and rallies up into a new life, and displays all the powers of her centre as light does in ether. All colors, all forms, all possibilities of being, are then brought before the seer. 154. If there were no art in the Divine world there would be none in this. The mystery is an art revealed to regenerating men, to advance them on to perfection; it is revealed, but by whom, whence, where? 155. You can’t get the medial nature, the anima media , either of man or nature without its law, and that law is an impulse towards rectification and regeneration. As the seed of a natural object to its nature, so is the seed of spirit to spirit. This is alluded to by St. Paul when he says, \"it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption”. 156. Every manifestation contains the promise of another superior to it, the germ or seed, as it were: Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas / Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum / Subjecit pedibus, etc. These words are a grand declaration of a deep Hermetic truth, for when the individual light of life is lodged in its casual centre, the whole of the evil nature adhering is precipitated to the extremities, destroying the downward gravitating attraction or rather overcoming it, and leaving all the threefold life freedom of ascent. This is a deep subject; I can hardly grapple it, it requires working out. That which relates us to the lower principle is cast out with the consciousness of the self evolved power, for:— 157. In the Regeneration there is a wonderful birth of freedom to act every and realize every volition; this, so far as regards self-will, is given up under the Christ-life in its higher development and subjected to the Father’s will. 158. What does the Reason ( vernunft ) seek? Causes, and, through secondary, the higher Cause, the punctum saliens of life, and there it finds 141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"its root consciously. The Light which springs up in that alliance is the Divine aurine seed and true form of gold. That was the \" Golden Bough\" which Aeneas carried, and which took him safely through Tartarus. 159 In the great combat of Life internal on the plain of truth, the will on either side, that of the universal and the self centre, sends forth all its troops, that is, the various powers, as they are called upon successively; the rational light keeping back to the last, and never aroused into action until deprived of its understanding essence which is taken captive by the rational light on the other side; not being able to subsist without this, the rational intellect goes forth to avenge it and die. This is predestinated from the first; the process, however, goes on over and over again; it is not concluded in this world. This war is the war between the two principles of the self-will and the Divine Will. We are born into the self-will, and by the Divine mercy shut up in nature in order that we may not feel the bitterness springing from the course of the self-life, what Böhme calls the bitter anguish of the driving wheel of existence. All the whole scheme of Christianity is to redeem us out of that misery by the interposition of God’s grace between us and it. 160. Alchemy goes beyond nature: it takes her up and advances her beyond her created stand in this world. \"Art, then, what nature left in hand doth take, /And out of one a two-fold work doth make.\" 161. I am perfectly sure that the Hermetic is the only true key to the old myths, and to Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, because the solution which it gives is entirely adequate to the subject. Procleus developes the ontological basis of the Iliad; Virgil wrote upon the same initiated ground; the Georgics are an allegory all through, an analogical instruction in celestial and spiritual agriculture. I regard the whole of the Aeneid as illustrative of the same truths in another form - the 6th Book markedly so. 162. When the Divine presence arises in the human life, all that is alien and contrary is dispelled “as wax before the fire”, as David says in the 68th Psalm, and there is great rejoicing and a setting free of the life which has been so long imprisoned, and at the further of the Divine Power all the circumferential etherial sphere is shaken and there is an abundant influx of the Holy Spirit; and underneath all this there is revealed that wonderful White Light which Van Helmont speaks of, though in a very superficial way, as the Quellem , and which the Kabalists celebrate as belonging to the Ancient of Days, i. e., the primeval Light. This action is a merging of the 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"whole of the variety of Life into its first unity. 163. In the process of the Hermetic regeneration there is a drawing of power and life up through the feet which may be called breathing, pumping up of the rich essences of the spirit; the essential gold which is of the substance of light; that, drawn up in this manner, becomes through our organization into operation and visibility if permitted, or unless returned for a higher purpose to its fountain. “The ransom of a man's life are his riches; \"man at that moment craving the riches of the whole world set before him, gives them up. This is imaged even in our ordinary life in the world, where we find men giving up the chance of acquiring wealth for science and her rewards, for poetry, for duty and what not How much more does this hold good for the true seeker when he is brought to the fountain head of all riches and wisdom essential. 164. Those old Grecian fables are wonderful, most acute, refined, witty; when understood they are most relishing. Take for instance the fable of Midas turning everything into gold and thereby starving himself. He is thus a representation of one whose will, for want of returning the aurific substance of life into its source and living there, becomes fossilized and starved in the mere possession of that life, holding it as he did in the selfhood. 165. The process is a passage of life through various spheres of being, in any of which the will may rest, but every one of which presents a law of progress at its development which should be pursued to the end - the Divine manifestation - and every stoppage of the will short of this is in its way punished. There is no standing still in those spheres of perpetual motion. Upwards or downwards the will must go. 166. It is quite true that Nature, as the Bishop of Oxford (Wilberforce) says, is as much the voice of God as Revelation is, but Nature, I think, no longer presents a true image or echo of that voice since the fall off from the Divine Law. Revelation is given to rectify and draw back man and all Nature through man to the original Truth. The present form of Nature is a fall off from the true representation, it gives a distorting shadow of the true. Nevertheless this has no reference to the possibility of facts of science contradicting the Bible. It does not alleviate that difficulty; where the Bible makes reference to natural facts the question stands on its own ground. 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 167. The Matter is seen with the inner eye, either of the agent in the patient, or the patient in the agent, for in the working of the Material they alternate. Synesius refers to that when he says in his Isis and Osiris , \"You also have been initiated into those mysteries where there are two pairs of eyes; those which are beneath are closed, when those which are above are opened,\" and vice versa . 168. The handling of the Matter is this, that when the Matter flows forth exteriorly from the new- born consciousness, it passes out into the hand and flows through the fingers, and is able to ferment another life and bring it into the same consciousness; this in its turn rises higher, and is able to re-act, raising again that other which raised it. 169. The entrance of the essential light of the reason into the chaos of the Vital Spirit (which always is in chaos, i.e., always coming to be, never is, and whilst in this life warts the re-birth), that entrance constricts the chaos at first into vivid images, but persisting in its direct look or intellectual perscrutination of the life, dissolves and disperses the images of which the chaos is fall. \" Strictamque Aeneas aciem venientibus offert / Et ni docta comes ,\" etc., etc. ( Aeneid VI. 291, &c ). Thcn the light goes on seeking the Paternal Life, the fundamental life; and finding it through the maternal instinct (the doves of Venus) is conjoined, and so far as it is conjoined is strengthened for further warfare. 170. Without the Golden Bough Aeneas could not proceed over or pass by Tartarus to see his Father. Tartarus is the death of this life. By propitiation, through the offering of the Golden Bough, he is passed safely through to the Elysian regions, where the Paternal ens resides in liberty. 171. The Rational Light is the strongest of all lights, and overcomes every other. All life moves orderly round the focus of that Light when that Light is found or realised. This constitutes the re- integration of being, the manifestation of the !\"#\"$ in man. 172. We are all of us drawn to our Ideal as to a star; to us the Ideal is a Light, a real objective attraction or magnet. 173. What you find all depends on what you look with; ontologically you find what you seek, that is, the ontological quality of the faculty you seek 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"with determines what you find; if you seek with a selfish, covetous, desiring spirit you find its object in the lower spiritual atmosphere, the first emanation from this life. We on earth live in the first arising from nature. Thoughts, images, passions, desires, words, loves, hates, all rise up through this first Ether Natural and abide on a sphere of their own above it. The higher faculties, the moral nature, with their results, are related to the pure Ether, which overlies the passion sphere. Above that is the Divine Light region which is the proper habitation of the high Reason when informed by the Love, and after it has been purified by passing through the humiliation. 174. The Protean life is very difficult of discovery: the last subterfuge of Proteus according to Homer in the Odyssey is transformation into a tree. This tree appears to be identical with that hearing the Golden Bough which Aeneas was ordered to find and take as his talisman to pass through the Infernal Regions to Elysium, where the Paternal Spirit lives. Prior to the ultimate transformation, however, it takes various other shapes. As the enquiring spirit enters into the ether life, the light that it seeks by compresses the ether and drives it about and causes it to take all sort of fantastic forms: the imaginative spirit is the maker of these images. \"No one,\" says Vaughan, \"enters into the Magian School but, he wanders awhile in the region of Chimaeras.\" These Chimaeras have all to be destroyed in order to reach the simple Hypostasis or radix of the reason that seeks; the “ aurai simplicis ignem .\" 175. True Science is the contact identical of the thing knowing with the thing known, subject with object. Of course, I mean ontologically; for Truth is, as it were, Light in its own ether, the Divine Wisdom self- conspicuous. 176. What a wonderful analysis of Time Procleus works out in his Commentary on the Timeus; he there takes it to be a created or secondary essential participation of the eternal Unit, or, better, a participation of the Paradigm by the image; not a mere relation as you make it, or a condition of thought as modem metaphysicians have it. 177. The solution of the sensuous spirit or vehicle is effected by the Perpendicular Magnetism, the fixation by the Horizontal altitude and latitude. By the former the soul is set free - it translates the consciousness into another medium. By it, the consciousness is brought into relation to 145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"another world and new experiences. \" Quis deus ,\" says Virgil in introducing the myth of Aristeus, a myth which bears altogether on the Vital transmutation in an advanced stage, \" Quis deus hanc musae quis nobis extudet artem? unde nova ingressus hominum experientia coepit? ” ( Georgics IV. 315, &c ) 178. It is an awful thing that when the Divine Life is being elicited in a man, the sins of this world press heavily upon him, through his sympathy with it, and his perception of the evil; it is as if the individual soul was responsible for all. 179. How nothing the individual is in comparison with the universal! We know nothing of Causalty - i.e., we have no experience of the Efficient Power. When the individual mind comes in contact with power universal, it then can understand the meaning of the words, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom, for that experience is the initial of the regenerate life; that which ferments the sensorium of this life, and lives upon its decease ultimately: its decease I say, for it comes up again ultimately. 180. Wuthering Heights , Emily Bronte's book, wants writing over again, or rather rewriting twice. It is a Saturnine mass of power in mere potentiality; a dark cloud; chaos before Light strikes through it. It wants the Jupiter element to clear it. Charlotte ought to have taken it in, hand for her sister, for Emily was not capable of clearing it. Charlotte Bronte was Jupiter and Lune; Emily Bronte was Saturn; Anne Bronte was Venus and Lune. 181. The “One Thing\" it is our psychical essence; our nervous system. \"Solution\" refers to the separation of the sensuous medium itself. You cut off the sensuous life and get into the intuitional; and when again you dissolve the intuitional, you get into the intuitional ( scil ., divine). \"Help Manual.\"The hand outward is an image of the invisible hand, its clothing; which, according to its attainment (i.e., the perfection of its own nature), works effects. The hands of the Ether are its transverse poles, which are formed by the divine differentiation everywhere, and are in man a \"natural fire \" - i .e., the fìre of the Ether in us, or of our life organism. The \"Philosophical Matter \" is the entelechy of body hearing the spirit, the antecedent cause, right up through. The human soul is more than a mere resultant of body; it is its ultimate perfection, for it is a space between two spheres. The “Ether” is the universal extended Matter; the Divine posit everywhere; life. The “Metals\" of the philosophers are the etherial metals; 146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the Ether's progressive stages; its processes; the arising of the Ether from and through its lower to its higher forms and qualities. The adept regards Nature inwardly and as a whole; he feels all in himself. The soul's angelic essence is a \" metallic humidity.\" The soul in its perfection is the Christian philosopher's stone. The soul in its metalline perfection is the philosopher's stone. Alchemy can be fully understood only by those who have entered on and are working the philosophic process; by those who, as Plato well says, are conversant with the soul in her philosophy - i.e., the recreative, or rather separative, process. All you get first of all is a pure matter which is passive, having no power of perfecting itself; it is the attractive power. But you must set free the masculine ferment, the sulphur or divine ferment (which is doubly hidden and bound in this life of ours) to effect the perfection of the matter. Our life is threefold. The \"salt,\" the will, opens it second fold. Each life must have its key and representative; the first has its status and being in sense. Dissolve the sensuous medium and you have the second or medial life. Dissolve the medial and you reach to the divine, which rectifies the whole individual. Visitabis interiora terrae , etc. Alchemy is philosophy; it is the philosophy, the seeking out of The Sophia in the mind. For production of effect there must be a return of the sulphur (this third, this obscure, this radical life) on its matrix. Each principle of the life - active, passive, and resultant - must be produced or evolved separately, and represented personally produces a universal work. 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"FIG 16 – The Istanlation of the current Imperator of AMORC Christian Bernard (born 30 November 1951) in the Supreme Temple of the Order in the city of San José, California, US. 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" FIG 17 – The cover of AMORC’s ILLUMINATI SECTION Twelfth Degree Monograph (Illuminati, later “Esoteric Hierarchy”, currently “Illuminatus Exemptus”) FIG 18 – William Walker Atkinson (1862 – 1932) 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" Do Pseudo Rosicrucians hold the key to hidden knowledge? Alchemy is the philosophy of the seeking out of The Sophia in the mind, and the possibility of practicing what modern pseudo Rosicrucians like A.M.O.R.C. now openly call “Mental Alchemy”, where they put “certain spiritual energies into motion, directing them in accordance with mystical law and natural principles.” However, the true Rosicrucian order should never accept fees and should have no formal organization, and is, in fact, super secret, and as other students of esoterica have underlined, these elements are rarely found in modern Rosicrucian groups like A.M.O.R.C. No wonder some sort of relationship existed between the founder of A.M.O.R.C. , Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883-1939), and the O.T.O. prior to 1921, when he received an official charter from Theodor Reuss making him “a Honorary Member of the Sovereign Sanctuary for Switzerland, Germany and Austria, and to represent O.T.O. Sovereign Sanctuary as Gage of Amity near the Supreme Council of A.M.O.R.C.” However, regardless of the O.TO. connection, it is truly rare that any real alchemical work of a good nature is done in such environments, often in the hands of witches and black magicians that use the seemingly innocent Rosicrucian/New Age image to work darker rituals in secret, possibly for one of the Satanic sects they might run in secret. William Walker Atkinson , an author who wrote about 100 books in the early 20th century under many pseudonyms, is credited for being one of the principle architects of the New Thought movement, which evolved into today’s New Age movement. He wrote the book, The Law of Attraction in the Thought World, and is one of the primary influences in Rhonda Byrne's book and movie The Secret , where, in fact, the word Rosicrucian , appears subtly on screen throughout the movie's title transitions, actually published under the name Magus Incognito . In The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians Atkinson gave away all the contents of the Rosicrucian degrees, and was truly critical of modern Rosicrucian fraternities, writing amongst other things: The student of the history of occultism and the esoteric teachings, and even the average reader of current books and magazines, finds many references to “The Rosicrucians,” a supposed ancient secret society devoted to the study of occult doctrines and the manifestation of occult powers. But when 150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"such person seeks to obtain detailed information concerning this supposed ancient “order” he finds himself baffled and defeated. Before acknowledging the futility of the quest, however, he usually investigates one or more so-called “orders” having as a part of their title the word “Rosicrucian,” only to find himself invited to join such “order” upon the payment of a fee or fees ranging from a small amount in some cases to quite large amounts in others, each “order” claiming to be the “only original order,” and asserting that all the others are base imitators. The truth is that there is not in existence, and never has been in existence, any popular occult order sanctioned by the real Rosicrucians, which anyone may join upon payment of fees, large or small, just as he may join any of the better known fraternal organizations of which there are so many. The true Rosicrucians have no formal organization, and are held together only by the ties of common interest in the occult and esoteric studies, and by the common acceptance of certain fundamental principles of belief and knowledge. However, Atkinson added in the subchapter entitled The Higher Alchemy something that explains AMORC’s emphasis in more recent years with “Mental Alchemy” : The Rosicrucians, according to the public encyclopaedias, and other works of reference, are held to have been devoted to the subject of Alchemy. And, indeed, this statement is correct. But the modern compilers of such reference books have fallen into the error of supposing that the Alchemy referred to was performed wholly upon the Plane of Matter—and concerned wholly with the Transmutation of Elements. They are ignorant of the fact that the Alchemy which attracted the Rosicrucians, and which took up most of their time and attention, was Mental Alchemy and Spiritual Alchemy—something quite different indeed, though having of course a correspondence to the Material Alchemy , according to the Law of Correspondence. The student of the present book will discover this fact, and will receive many valuable hints concerning the higher forms of Alchemy, providing he is prepared to read between the lines of the text, and to reason by Analogy. The axiom \"As above, so below,\" will be found to work out Masonic Catechism and Alchemical Teachings 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Masonic catechism is a series of memorized questions and answers, pertaining to a specific degree in Freemasonry, a modality also in use in the para-masonic Illuminati, and Rosicrucian orders, like the S.R.I.A. Usually, the candidate meets with a lodge or chapter member who knows these catechisms, and helps him to memorize the work, or they are recited during the meeting with the other members, so they can remain in the memory of the listeners. The catechism simply reiterates the degree work that the candidate recently completed, and proves his proficiency with them. Once a catechism is completed and fully understood, the candidate can proceed to the next degree. In the Ritual de la Haute Magie , chapter 19, Eliphas Levi describes a manuscript of Paracelsus supposedly found in the Vatican, entitled The Chemical Pathway or Manual. He claims that this catechism was transcribed by Michael Sendivogius (Polish: Michał Sędziwój; 1566– 1636), who was a known Polish alchemist and an Unknown Superior of the Illuminati, and was later used by high level Freemason and Initiate Baron Tschoudy, when composing the Hermetic Catechism, in his L'Etoile Flamboyant ou la Société des Franc- Maçons considerée sous tous les aspects , 1766. Like other researchers before me, I have not been able to locate the original Paracelsus work in the Vatican, nor Sendivogius' supposed transcription, however, the Hermetic Catechism of Baron Tschoudy is a very important piece of hermetic philosophy, that can help us all understand more about the key role of alchemy in the Western Initiatic System. As a catechism, it can also be used by you and your friends, whether you are Masons or not, to learn the secrets of the Royal Art of Alchemy. It is not a historical examination of the science and philosophy behind it, but something much deeper, especially if you understand the hidden meaning of certain code words present in the text. The version that I include here has been taken from A.E. Waite's translation, published in the two-volume Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus , which he heavily edited, inserting the Masonic remarks of Tschoudy. This makes it even more important to study this catechism, in order to possibly understand the hidden secrets of the Illuminati network and their teachings, often veiled in allegory, and hidden by symbols and strange words, that have meanings known only to their initiates. I can say without exaggerating, that learning from this catechism might not make you necessarily an immortal, but you will become a true Illuminati. However, it is up to you to use such knowledge for the good of mankind, and not for evil purposes. We go back to what I said in the 152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"beginning of the book, about The Law of Use, don’t ever forget those words! A SHORT CATECHISM OF ALCHEMY Q. What is the chief study of a Philosopher? A. It is the investigation of the operations of Nature. Q. What is the end of Nature? A. God, Who is also its beginning. Q. Whence are all things derived? A. From one and indivisible Nature. Q. Into how many regions is Nature separated? A. Into four palmary regions. Q. Which are they? A. The dry, the moist, the warm, and the cold, which are the four elementary qualities, whence all things originate. Q. How is Nature differentiated? A. Into male and female. Q. To what may we compare Nature? A. To Mercury. Q. Give a concise definition of Nature. A. It is not visible, though it operates visibly; for it is simply a volatile spirit, fulfilling its office in bodies, and animated by the universal spirit- the divine breath, the central and universal fire, which vivifies all things that exist. Q. What should be the qualities possessed by the examiners of Nature? A. They should be like unto Nature herself. That is to say, they should be truthful, simple, patient, and persevering. Q. What matters should subsequently engross their attention? A. The philosophers should most carefully ascertain whether their designs are in harmony with Nature, and of a possible and attainable kind; if they 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"would accomplish by their own power anything that is usually performed by the power of Nature, they must imitate her in every detail. Q. What method must be followed in order to produce something which shall be developed to a superior degree than Nature herself develops it. A. The manner of its improvement must be studied, and this is invariably operated by means of a like nature. For example, if it be desired to develop the intrinsic virtue of a given metal beyond its natural condition, the chemist must avail himself of the metallic nature itself, and must be able to discriminate between its male and female differentiations. Q. Where does the metallic nature store her seeds? A. In the four elements. Q. With what materials can the philosopher alone accomplish anything? A. With the germ of the given matter; this is its elixir or quintessence, more precious by far, and more useful, to the artist, that is Nature herself. Before the philosopher has extracted the seed, or germ, Nature, in his behalf, will be ready to perform her duty. Q. What is the germ, or seed, of any substance? A. It is the most subtle and perfect decoction and digestion of the substance itself; or, rather, it is the Balm of Sulphur, which is identical with the Radical Moisture of Metals. Q. By what is this seed, or germ, engendered? A. By the four elements, subject to the will of the Supreme Being, and through the direct intervention of the imagination of Nature. Q. After what manner do the four elements operate? A. By means of an incessant and uniform motion, each one, according to its quality, depositing its seed in the centre of the earth, where it is subjected to action and digested, and is subsequently expelled in an outward direction by the laws of movement. Q. What do the philosophers understand by the centre of the earth? A. A certain void place where nothing may repose, and the existence of which is assumed. Q. Where, then, do the four elements expel and deposit their seeds? A. In the ex-centre, or in the margin and circumference of the centre, 154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"which, after it has appropriated a portion, casts out the surplus into the region of excrement, scoriae, fire, and formless chaos. Q. Illustrate this teaching by an example. A. Take any level table, and set in its centre a vase filled with water; surround the vase with several things of various colors, especially salt, taking care that a proper distance intervenes between them all. Then pour out the water from the vase, and it will flow in streams here and there; one will encounter a substance of a red colour, and will assume a tinge of red; another will pass over the salt, and will contract a saline flavour; for it is certain that water does not modify the places which it traverses, but the diverse characteristics of places change the nature of water. In the same way the seed which is deposited by the four elements at the centre of the earth is subject to a variety of modifications in the places through which it passes, so that every existing substance is produced in the likeness of its channel, and when a seed on its arrival at a certain point encounters pure earth and pure water, a pure substance results, but the contrary in an opposite case. Q. After what manner do the elements procreate this seed? A. In order to the complete elucidation of this point, it must be observed that there are two gross and heavy elements and two that are volatile in character. Two, in like manner, are dry and two humid, one out of the four being actually excessively dry, and the other excessively moist. They are also masculine and feminine. Now, each of them has a marked tendency to reproduce its own species within its own sphere. Moreover, they are never in repose, but are perpetually interacting, and each of them separates, of and by itself, the most subtle portion thereof. Their general place of meeting is in the centre, even the centre of the Archeus, that servant of Nature, where coming to mix their several seeds, they agitate and finally expel them to the exterior. Q. What is the true and the first matter of all metals? A. The first matter, properly so-called, is dual in its essence, or is in itself of a twofold nature; one, nevertheless, cannot create a metal without the concurrence of the other. The first and the palmary essence is an aerial humidity, blended with a warm air, in the form of a fatty water, which adheres to all substances indiscriminately, whether they are pure or impure. Q. How has this humidity been named by Philosophers? 155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"A. Mercury. Q. By what is it governed? A.By the rays of the Sun and Moon. Q. What is the second matter? A. The warmth of the earth -otherwise, that dry heat which is termed Sulphur by the Philosophers. Q. Can the entire material body be converted into seed? A. Its eight-hundredth part only-that, namely, which is secreted in the centre of the body in question, and may, for example, be seen in a grain of wheat. Q. Of what use is the bulk of the matter as regards its seed? A. It is useful as a safeguard against excessive heat, cold, moisture, or aridity, and, in general, all hurtful inclemency, against which it acts as an envelope. Q. Would those artists who pretend to reduce the whole matter of any body into seed derive any advantage from the process, supposing it were possible to perform it? A. None; on the contrary, their labour would be wholly unproductive, because nothing that is good can be accomplished by a deviation from natural methods. Q. What, therefore, should be done? A. The matter must be effectively separated from its impurities, for there is no metal, how pure soever, which is entirely free from imperfections, though their extent varies. Now all superfluities, cortices, and scoriae must be peeled off and purged out from the matter in order to discover its seed. Q. What should receive the most careful attention of the Philosopher? A. Assuredly, the end of Nature, and this is by no means to be looked for in the vulgar metals, because, these having issued already from the hands of the fashioner, it is no longer to be found therein. Q. For what precise reason? A. Because the vulgar metals, and chiefly gold, are absolutely dead, while ours, on the contrary, are absolutely living, and possess a soul. 156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Q. What is the life of metals? A. It is no other substance than fire, when they are as yet embedded in the mines. Q. What is their death? A. Their life and death are in reality one principle, for they die, as they live, by fire, but their death is from a fire of fusion. Q. After what manner are metals conceived in the womb of the earth? A. When the four elements have developed their power or virtue in the centre of the earth, and have deposited their seed, the Archeus of Nature, in the course of a distillatory process, sublimes them superficially by the warmth and energy of the perpetual movement. Q. Into what does the wind resolve itself when it is distilled through the pores of the earth? A. It resolves itself into water, whence all things spring; in this state it is merely a humid vapour, out of which there is subsequently evolved the principiated principle of all substances, which also serves as the first matter of the Philosophers. Q. What then is this principiated principle, which is made use of as the first matter by the Children of Knowledge in the philosophic achievement? A. It is this identical matter, which, the moment it is conceived, receives a permanent and unchangeable form. Q. Are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, etc., separately endowed with individual seed? A. One is common to them all; their differences are to be accounted for by the: locality from which they are derived, not to speak of the fact that Nature completes her work with far greater rapidity in the procreation of silver than in that of gold, and so of the other metals, each in its own proportion. Q. How is gold formed in the bowels of the earth? A. When this vapour, of which we have spoken, is sublimed in the centre of the earth, and when it has passed through warm and pure places, where a certain sulphureous grease adheres to the channels, then this vapour, which the Philosophers have denominated their Mercury, becomes adapted 157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"and joined to this grease, which it sublimes with itself; from such amalgamation there is produced a certain unctuousness, which, abandoning the vaporous form, assumes that of grease, and is sublimised in other places, which have been cleansed by this preceding vapour, and the earth whereof has consequently, been rendered more subtle, pure, and humid; it fills the pores of this earth, is joined thereto, and gold is produced as a result. Q. How is Saturn engendered? A. It occurs when the said unctuosity, or grease, passes through places which are totally impure and cold. Q. How is Venus brought forth? A. She is produced in localities where the earth itself is pure, but is mingled with impure sulphur. Q. What power does the vapour, which we have recently mentioned, possess in the centre of the earth? A. By its continual progress it has the power of perpetually rarefying whatsoever is crude and impure, and of successively attracting to itself all that is pure around it. Q. What is the seed of the first matter of all things? A. The first matter of things, that is to say, the matter of principiating principles is begotten by Nature, without the assistance of any other seed; in other words, Nature receives the matter from the elements, whence it subsequently brings forth the seed. Q. What, absolutely speaking, is therefore the seed of things? A. The seed in a body is no other thing than a congealed air, or a humid vapour, which is useless except it be dissolved by a warm vapour. Q. How is the generation of seed comprised in the metallic kingdom? A. By the artifice of Archeus the four elements, in the first generation of Nature, distil a ponderous vapour of water into the centre of the earth ; this is the seed of metals, and it is called Mercury, not on account of its essence, but because of its fluidity, and the facility with which it will adhere to each and everything. Q. Why is this vapour compared to sulphur? A. Because of its internal heat. 158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Q. From what species of Mercury are we to conclude that the metals are composed? A. The reference is exclusively to the Mercury of the Philosophers, and in no sense to the common or vulgar substance, which cannot become a seed, seeing that, like other metals, it already contains its own seed. Q. What, therefore, must actually be accepted as the subject of our matter? A. The seed alone, otherwise the fixed grain, and not the whole body, which is differentiated into Sulphur, or living male, and into Mercury, or living female. Q. What operation must be afterwards performed. A. They must be joined together, so that they may form a germ, after which they will proceed to the procreation of a fruit which is conformed to their nature. Q. What is the part of the artist in this operation? A. The artist must do nothing but separate that which is subtle from that which is gross. Q. To what, therefore, is the whole philosophic combination reduced? A. The development of one into two, and the reduction of two into one, and nothing further. Q. Whither must we turn for the seed and life of meals and minerals? A. The seed of minerals is properly the water which exists in the centre And the heart of the minerals. Q. How does Nature operate by the help of Art? A. Every seed, whatsoever its kind, is useless, unless by Nature or Art it is placed in a suitable matrix, where it receives its life by the coction of the germ! and by the congelation of the pure particle, or fixed grain. Q. How is the seed subsequently nourished and preserved? A. By the warmth of its body. Q. What is therefore performed by the artist in the mineral kingdom? A. He finishes what cannot be finished by Nature on account of the crudity of the air, which has permeated the pores of all bodies by its violence, on the surface and not in the bowels of the earth. 159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Q. What correspondence have the metals among themselves? A. It is necessary for a proper comprehension of the nature of this correspondence to consider the position of the planets, and to pay attention to Saturn, which is the highest of all, and then is succeeded by Jupiter, next by Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and, lastly, by the Moon. It must be observed that the influential virtues of the planets do not ascend but descend, and experience teaches us that Mars can be easily converted into Venus, not Venus into Mars, which is of a lower sphere. So, also, Jupiter can be easily transmuted into Mercury, because Jupiter is superior to Mercury, the one being second after the firmament, the other second above the earth, and Saturn is highest of all, while the Moon is lowest. The Sun enters into all, but it is never ameliorated by its inferiors. It is clear that there is a large correspondence between Saturn and the Moon, in the middle of which is the Sun; but to all these changes the Philosopher should strive to administer the Sun. Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver? A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life. Q. What is the object of research among the Philosophers? A. Proficiency in the art of perfecting what Nature has left imperfect in the mineral kingdom, and the attainment of the treasure of the Philosophical Stone. Q. What is this Stone? A. The Stone is nothing else than the radical humidity of the elements, perfectly purified and reduced into a sovereign fixation, which causes it to perform such great things for health, life being resident exclusively in the humid radical. Q. In what does the secret of accomplishing this admirable work consist? A. It consists in knowing how to educe from potentiality into activity the innate warmth, or the fire of Nature, which is enclosed in the centre of the radical humidity. Q. What are the precautions which must be made use of to guard against failure in the work? 160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"A. Great pains must be taken to eliminate excrements from the matter, and to conserve nothing but the kernel, which contains all the virtue of the compound. Q. Why does this medicine heal every species of disease? A. It is not on account of tile variety of its qualities, but simply because it powerfully fortifies the natural warmth, which it gently stimulates, while other physics irritate it by too violent an action. Q How can you demonstrate to me the truth of the art in the matter of the tincture? A. Firstly, its truth is founded on the fact that the physical powder, being composed of the same substance as the metals, namely, quicksilver, has the faculty of combining with these in fusion, one nature easily embracing another which is like itself. Secondly, seeing that the imperfection of the base metals is owing to the crudeness of their quicksilver, and to that alone, the physical powder, which is a ripe and decocted quicksilver, and, in itself a pure fire, can easily communicate to them its own maturity, and can transmute them into its nature, after it has attracted their crude humidity, that is to say, their quicksilver, which is the sole substance that transmutes them, the rest being nothing but scoriae and excrements, which are rejected in projection. Q. What road should the Philosopher follow that he may attain to the knowledge and execution of the physical work? A. That precisely which was followed by the Great Architect of the Universe in the creation of the world, by observing how the chaos was evolved. Q. What was the matter of the chaos? A. It could be nothing else than a humid vapour, because water alone enters into all created substances, which all finish in a strange term, this term being a proper subject for the impression of all forms. Q. Give me an example to illustrate what you have just stated. A. An example may be found in the special productions of composite substances, the seeds of which invariably begin by resolving themselves into a certain humour, which is the chaos of the particular matter, whence issues, by a kind of irradiation, the complete form of the plant. Moreover, it should be observed that Holy Scripture makes no mention of anything except water as the material subject whereupon the Spirit of God brooded, 161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"nor of anything except light as the universal form of things. Q. What profit may the Philosopher derive from these considerations, and what should he especially remark in the method of creation which was pursued by the Supreme Being? A. In the first place he should observe the matter out of which the world was made; he will see that out of this confused mass, the Sovereign Artist began by extracting light, that this light in the same moment dissolved the darkness which covered the face of the earth, and that it served as the universal form of the matter. He will then easily perceive that in the generation of all composite substances, a species of irradiation takes place, and a separation of light and darkness, wherein Nature is an undeviating copyist of her Creator. The Philosopher will equally understand after what manner, by the action of this light, the empyrean, or firmament which divides the superior and inferior waters, was subsequently produced; how the sky was studded with luminous bodies; and how the necessity for the moon arose, which was owing to the space intervening between the things above and the things below; for the moon is an intermediate torch between the superior and the inferior worlds, receiving the celestial influences and communicating them to the earth. Finally he will understand how the Creator, in the gathering of the waters, produced dry land. Q. How many heavens can you enumerate? A. Properly there is one only, which is the firmament that divides the waters from the waters. Nevertheless, three are admitted, of which the first is the space that is above the clouds. In this heaven the waters are rarefied, and fall upon the fixed stars, and it is also in this space that the planets and wandering stars perform their revolutions. The second heaven is the firmament of the fixed stars, while the third is the abode of the supercelestial waters. Q. Why is the rarefaction of the waters confined to the first heaven? A. Because it is in the nature of rarefied substances to ascend, and because God, in His eternal laws, has assigned its proper sphere to everything. Q. Why does each celestial body invariably revolve about an axis? A. It is by reason of the primeval impetus which it received, and by virtue of the same law which will cause any heavy substance suspended from a thread to turn with the same velocity, if the power which impels its motion be always equal. 162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Q. Why do the superior waters never descend? A. Because of their extreme rarefaction. It is, for this reason, that a skilled chemist can derive more profit from the study of rarefaction than from any other science whatsoever. Q. What is the matter of the firmament? A. It is properly air, which is more suitable than water as a medium of light. Q. After the separation of the waters from the dry earth, what was performed by the Creator to originate generation? A. He created a certain light which was destined for this office; He placed it in the central fire, and moderated this fire by the humidity of water and by the coldness of earth, so as to keep a check upon its energy and adapt it to His design. Q. What is the action of this central fire? A. It continually operates upon the nearest humid matter, which it exalts into vapour; now this vapour is the mercury of Nature and the first matter of the three kingdoms. Q. How is the sulphur of Nature subsequently formed? A. By the interaction of the central fire and the mercurial vapour. Q. How is the salt of the sea produced? A. By the action of the same fire upon aqueous humidity, when the aerial humidity, which is contained therein, has been exhaled. Q. What should be done by a truly wise Philosopher when he has once mastered the foundation and the order in the procedure of the Great Architect of the Universe in the construction of all that exists in Nature? A. He should, as far as may be possible, become a faithful copyist of his Creator. In the physical chaos he should make his chaos such as the original actually was; he should separate the light from the darkness : he should form his firmament for the separation of the waters which are above from the waters which are below, and should successively accomplish, point by point, the entire sequence of the creative act. Q. With what is this grand and sublime operation performed? A. With one single corpuscle, or minute body, which, so to speak, contains 163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"nothing but faeces, filth, and abominations, but whence a certain tenebrous and mercurial humidity is extracted, which contains in itself all that is required by the Philosopher, because, as a fact, he is in search of nothing hut the true Mercury. Q. What kind of mercury, therefore, must he make use of in performing the work? A. Of a mercury which, as such, is not found on the earth, but is extracted from bodies, yet not from vulgar mercury, as it has been falsely said. Q. Why is the latter unfitted to the needs of our work? A. Because the wise artist must take notice that vulgar mercury has an insufficient quantity of sulphur, and he should consequently, operate upon a body created by Nature, in which Nature herself has united the sulphur and mercury that it is the work of the artist to separate. Q. What must he subsequently do? A. He must purify them and join them anew together. Q. How do you denominate the body of which we have been speaking? A. The RUDE STONE, Or Chaos, or Iliaste, or Hyle--that confused mass which is known but universally despised. Q. As you have told me that Mercury is the one thing which the Philosopher must absolutely understand, will you give me a circumstantial description of it, so as to avoid misconception? A. In respect of its nature, our Mercury is dual--fixed and volatile; in regard to its motion, it is also dual, for it has a motion of ascent and of descent; by that of descent, it is the influence of plants, by which it stimulates the drooping fire of Nature, and this is its first office previous to congelation. By its ascensional movement, it rises, seeking to be purified, and as this is after congelation, it is considered to be the radical moisture of substances, which, beneath its vile scoriae, still preserves the nobility of its first origin. Q. How many species of moisture do you suppose to be in each composite thing? A. There are three--the Elementary, which is properly the vase of the other elements; the Radical, which, accurately speaking, is the oil, or balm, in which the entire virtue of the subject is resident--lastly, the Alimentary, the true natural dissolvent, which draws up the drooping internal fire, causing 164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"corruption and blackness by its humidity, and fostering and sustaining the subject. Q. How many species of Mercury are there known to the Philosophers? A. The Mercury of the Philosophers may be regarded under four aspects; the first is entitled the Mercury of bodies, which is actually their concealed seed; the second is the Mercury of Nature, which is the Bath or Vase of the Philosophers, otherwise the humid radical; to the third has been applied the designation, Mercury of the Philosophers, because it is found in their laboratory and in their minera. It is the sphere of Saturn; it is the Diana of the Wise; it is the true salt of metals, after the acquisition of which the true philosophic work may be truly said to have begun. In its fourth aspect, it is called Common Mercury, which yet is not that of the Vulgar, but rather is properly the true air of the Philosophers, the true middle substance of water, the true secret and concealed fire, called also common fire, because it is common to all minerae, for it is the substance of metals, and thence do they derive their quantity and quality. Q. How many operations art comprised in our work? A. There is one only, which may be resolved into sublimation, and sublimation, according to Geber, is nothing other than the elevation of the dry matter by the mediation of fire, with adherence to its own vase. Q. What precaution should be taken in reading the Hermetic Philosophers? A. Great care, above all, must be observed upon this point, lest what they say upon the subject should be interpreted literally and in accordance with the mere sound of the words: For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. Q. What books should be read in order to have an acquaintance with our science? A. Among the ancients, all the works of Hermes should especially be studied; in the next place, a certain book, entitled The Passage of the Red Sea, and another, The Entrance into the Promised Land. Paracelsus also should be read before all among elder writers, and, among other treatises, his Chemical Pathway, or the Manual of Paracelsus, which contains all the mysteries of demonstrative physics and the most arcane Kabbalah. This rare and unique manuscript work exists only in the Vatican Library, but Sendivogius had the good fortune to take a copy of it, which has 165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"helped in the illumination of the sages of our order. Secondly, Raymond Lully must be read, and his Vade Mecum above all, his dialogue called the Tree of Life, his testament, and his codicil. There must, however, be a certain precaution exercised in respect to the two last, because, like those of Geber, and also of Arnold de Villanova, they abound in false recipes and futile fictions, which seem to have been inserted with the object of more effectually disguising the truth from the ignorant. In the third place, the Turba Philosophorum which is a collection of ancient authors, contains much that is materially good, though there is much also which is valueless. Among mediaeval writers Zachary, Trevisan, Roger Bacon, and a certain anonymous author, whose book is entitled The Philosophers, should be held especially high in the estimation of the student. Among moderns the most worthy to be prized are John Fabricius, Francois de Nation, and Jean D'Espagnet, who wrote Physics Restored, though, to say the truth, he has imported some false precepts and fallacious opinions into his treatise. Q. When may the Philosopher venture to undertake the work? A. When he is, theoretically, able to extract, by means of a crude spirit, a digested spirit out of a body in dissolution, which digested spirit he must again rejoin to the vital oil. Q. Explain me this theory in a clearer manner. A. It may be demonstrated more completely in the actual process; the great experiment may be undertaken when the Philosopher, by the medium of a vegetable menstruurn, united to a mineral menstruum, is qualified to dissolve a third essential menstruum, with which menstruums united he must wash the earth, and then exalt it into a celestial quintessence, to compose the sulphureous thunderbolt, which instantaneously penetrates substances and destroys their excrements. Q. Have those persons a proper acquaintance with Nature who pretend to make use of vulgar gold for seed, and of vulgar mercury for the dissolvent, or the earth in which it should be sown? A. Assuredly not, because neither the one nor the other possesses the external agent--gold, because it has been deprived of it by decoction, and mercury because it has never had it. Q. In seeking this auriferous seed elsewhere than in gold itself, is there no danger of producing a species of monster, since one appears to be departing from Nature? 166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"A. It is undoubtedly true that in gold is contained the auriferous seed, and that in a more perfect condition than it is found in any other body; but this does not force us to make use of vulgar gold, for such a seed is equally found in each of the other metals, and is nothing else but that fixed grain which Nature has infused in the first congelation of mercury, all metals having one origin and a common substance, as will be ultimately unveiled to those who become worthy of receiving it by application and assiduous study. Q. What follows from this doctrine? A. It follows that, although the seed is more perfect in gold, it may be extracted much more easily from another body than from gold itself, other bodies being more open, that is to say, less digested, and less restricted in their humidity. Q. Give me an example taken from Nature. A. Vulgar gold may be likened to a fruit which, having come to a perfect maturity, has been cut off from its tree, and though it contains a most perfect and well-digested seed, notwithstanding, should anyone set it in the ground, with a view to its multiplication, much time, trouble, and attention will be consumed in the development of its vegetative capabilities. On the other hand, if a cutting, or a root, be taken from the same tree, and similarly planted, in a short time, and with no trouble, it will spring up and produce much fruit. Q. Is it necessary that an amateur of this science should understand the formation of metals in the bowels of the earth if he wishes to complete his work ? A. So indispensable is such a knowledge that should anyone fail, before all other studies, to apply himself to its attainment, and to imitate Nature point by point therein, he will never succeed in accomplishing anything but what is worthless. Q. How, then, does Nature deposit metals in the bowels of the earth, and of what does she compose them ? A. Nature manufactures them all out of sulphur and mercury, and forms them by their double vapour. Q. What do you mean by this double vapour, and how can metals be formed thereby? A. In order to a complete understanding of this question, it must first be 167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"stated that mercurial vapour is united to sulphureous vapour in a cavernous place which contains a saline water, which serves as their matrix . Thus is formed, firstly, the Vitriol of Nature ; secondly, by the commotion of the elements, there is developed out of this Vitriol of Nature a new vapour, which is neither mercurial nor sulphureous, yet is allied to both these natures, and this, passing through places to which the grease of sulphur adheres, is joined therewith, and out of their union a glutinous substance is produced, otherwise, a formless mass, which is permeated by the vapour that fills these cavernous places. By this vapour, acting through the sulphur it contains, are produced the perfect metals, provided that the vapour and the locality are pure. If the locality and the vapour are impure, imperfect metals result. The terms perfection and imperfection have reference to various degrees of concoction. Q. What is contained in this vapour? A. A spirit of light and a spirit of fire, of the nature of the celestial bodies, which properly should be considered as the form of the universe. Q. What does this vapour represent? A. This vapour, thus impregnated by the universal spirit, represents, in a fairly complete way, the original Chaos, which contained all that was required for the original creation, that is, universal matter and universal form. Q. And one cannot, notwithstanding, make use of vulgar mercury in the process? A. No, because vulgar mercury, as already made plain, is devoid of external agent. Q. Whence comes it that common mercury is without its external agent? A. Because in the exaltation of the double vapour, the commotion has been so great and searching, that the spirit, or agent, has evaporated, as occurs, with very close similarity, in the fusion of metals. The result is that the unique mercurial part is deprived of its masculine or sulphureous agent, and consequently, can never be transmuted into gold by Nature. Q. How many species of gold are distinguished by the Philosophers? A. Three sorts :--Astral Gold, Elementary Gold, and Vulgar Gold. Q. What is astral gold? A. Astral Gold has its centre in the sun, which communicates it by its rays 168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"to all inferior beings. It is an igneous substance, which receives a continual emanation of solar corpuscles that penetrate all things sentient, vegetable, and mineral. Q. What do you refer to under the term Elementary Gold ? A. This is the most pure and fixed portion of the elements, and of all that is composed of them. All sublunary beings included in the three kingdoms contain in their inmost centre a precious grain of this elementary gold. Q. Give me some description of Vulgar Gold ? A. It is the most beautiful metal of our acquaintance, the best that Nature can produce, as perfect as it is unalterable in itself. Q. Of what species of gold is the Stone of the Philosophers ? A. It is of the second species, as being the most pure portion of all the metallic elements after its purification, when it is termed living philosophical gold. A perfect equilibrium and equality of the four elements enter into the Physical Stone, and four things are indispensable for the accomplishment of the work, namely, composition, allocation, mixture, and union, which, once performed according to the rules of art, will beget the lawful Son of the Sun, and the Phoenix which eternally rises out of its own ashes. Q. What is actually the living gold of the Philosophers? A. It is exclusively the fire of Mercury, or that igneous virtue, contained in the radical moisture, to which it has already communicated the fixity and the nature of the sulphur, whence it has emanated, the mercurial character of the whole substance of philosophical sulphur permitting it to be alternatively termed mercury. Q. What other name is also given by the Philosophers to their living gold ? A. They also term it their living sulphur, and their true fire; they recognize its existence in all bodies, and there is nothing that can subsist without it. Q. Where must we look for our living gold, our living sulphur, and our true fire ? A. In the house of Mercury. Q. By what is this fire nourished? 169"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"A. By the air. Q. Give me a comparative illustration of the power of this fire ? A. To exemplify the attraction of this interior fire, there is no better comparison than that which is derived from the thunderbolt, which originally is simply a dry, terrestrial exhalation, united to a humid vapour. By exaltation, and by assuming the igneous nature, it acts on the humidity which is inherent to it; this it attracts to itself, transmutes it into its own nature, and then rapidly precipitates itself to the earth, where it is attracted by a fixed nature which is like unto its own. Q. What should be done by the Philosopher after he has extracted his Mercury ? A. He should develop it from potentiality into activity. Q. Cannot Nature perform this of herself? A. No; because she stops short after the first sublimation, and out of the matter which is thus disposed do the metals engender. Q. What do the Philosophers understand by their gold and silver? A. The Philosophers apply to their Sulphur the name of Gold, and to their Mercury the name of Silver. Q. Whence are they derived? A. I have already stated that they are derived from a homogeneous body wherein they are found in great abundance, whence also Philosophers know how to extract both by an admirable, and entirely philosophical, process. Q. When this operation has been duly performed, to what other point of the practice must they next apply themselves? A. To the confection of the philosophical amalgam, which must be done with great care, but can only be accomplished after the preparation and sublimation of the Mercury. Q. When should your matter be combined with the living gold? A. During the period of amalgamation only, that is to say, Sulphur is introduced into it by means of the amalgamation, and thenceforth there is one substance; the process is shortened by the addition of Sulphur, while the tincture at the same time is augmented. 170"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Q. What is contained in the centre of the radical moisture ? A. It contains and conceals Sulphur, which is covered with a hard rind. Q. What must be done to apply it to the Great Work? A. It must be drawn, out of its bonds with consummate skill, and by the method of putrefaction. Q. Does Nature, in her work in the mines, possess a menstruum which is adapted to the dissolution and liberation of this sulphur? A. No; because there is no local movement. Could Nature, unassisted, dissolve, putrefy, and purify the metallic body, she would herself provide us with !he Physical Stone, which is Sulphur exalted and increased in virtue. Q. Can you elucidate this doctrine by an example? A. By an enlargement of the previous comparison of a fruit, or a seed, which, in the first place, is put into the earth for its solution, and afterwards for its multiplication. Now, the Philosopher, who is in a position to discern what is good seed, extracts it from its centre, consigns it to its proper earth, when it has been well cured and prepared, and therein he rarefies it in such a manner that its prolific virtue is increased and indefinitely multiplied. Q. In what does the whole secret of the seed consist ? A. In the true knowledge of its proper earth. Q. What do you understand by the seed in the work Of the Philosophers ? A. I understand the interior heat, or the specific spirit, which is enclosed in the humid radical, which, in other words, is the middle substance of living silver, the proper sperm of metals, which contains its own seed. Q. How do you set free the sulphur from its bonds? A. By putrefaction. Q. What is the earth of minerals ? A. It is their proper menstruum. Q. What pains must be taken by the Philosopher to extract that part which he requires? A. He must take great pains to eliminate the fetid vapours and impure 171"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"sulphurs, after which the seed must be injected. Q. By what indication may the Artist be assured that he is in the right road at the beginning of his work? A. When he finds that the dissolvent and the thing dissolved are converted into one form and one matter at the period of dissolution. Q. How many solutions do you count in the Philosophic Work? A. There are three. The first solution is that which reduces the crude and metallic body into its elements of sulphur and of living silver; the second is that of the physical body, and the third is the solution of the mineral earth. Q. How is the metallic body reduced by the first solution into mercury, and then into sulphur? A. By the secret artificial fire, which is the Burning Star. Q. How is this operation performed? A. By extracting from the subject, in the first place, the mercury or vapour of the elements, and, after purification, by using it to liberate the sulphur from its bonds, by corruption, of which blackness is the indication. Q. How is the second solution performed ? A. When the physical body is resolved into the two substances previously mentioned, and has acquired the celestial nature. Q. What is the name which is applied by Philosophers to the Matter during this period? A, It is called their Physical Chaos, and it is, in fact, the true First Matter, a name which can hardly be applied before the conjunction of the male-- which is sulphur--with the female--which is silver. Q. To what does the third solution refer? A. It is the humectation of the mineral earth and it is closely bound up with multiplication. Q. What fire must be made use of in our work ? A. That fire which is used by Nature. Q. What is the potency of this fire? A. It dissolves everything that is in the world, because it is the principle of 172"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"all dissolution and corruption. Q. Why is it also termed Mercury ? A. Because it is in its nature aerial, and a most subtle vapour, which partakes at the same time of sulphur, whence it has contracted some contamination. Q. Where is this fire concealed ? A. It is concealed in the subject of art. Q. Who is it that is familiar with, and can produce, this fire? A. It is known to the wise, who can both produce it and purify it. Q. What is the essential potency and characteristic of this fire ? A. It is excessively dry, and is continually in motion; it seeks only to disintegrate and to educe things from potentiality into actuality; it is that, in a word, which coming upon solid places in mines, circulates in a vaporous form upon the matter, and dissolves it. Q. How may this fire be most easily distinguished? A. By the sulphureous excrements in which it is enveloped, and by the saline environment with which it is clothed. Q. What must be added to this fire so as to accentuate its capacity for incineration in the feminine species? A. On account of its extreme dryness it requires to be moistened. Q. How many philosophical fires do you enumerate ?A. There are in all three--the natural, the unnatural, and the contra-natural. Q. Explain to me these three species of fires. A. The natural fire is the masculine fire, or the chief agent; the unnatural is the feminine, which is the dissolvent of Nature, nourishing a white smoke, and assuming that form. This smoke is quickly dissipated, unless much care be exercised, and it is almost incombustible, though by philosophical sublimation it becomes corporeal and resplendent. The contra-natural fire is that which disintegrates compounds and has the power to unbind what has' been bound very closely by Nature. Q. Where is our matter to be found? A. It is to be found everywhere, but it must specially be sought in metallic nature, where it is more easily available than elsewhere. 173"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Q. What kind must be preferred before all others ? A. The most mature, the most appropriate, and the easiest; but care, before all things, must be taken that the metallic essence shall be present, not only potentially but in actuality, and that there is, moreover, a metallic splendour. Q. Is everything contained in this subject? A. Yes; but Nature, at the same time, must be assisted, so that the work may be perfected and hastened, and this by the means which are familiar to the higher grades of experiment. Q. Is this subject exceedingly precious ? A. It is vile, and originally is without native elegance; should anyone say that it is saleable, it is the species to which they refer, but, fundamentally, it is not saleable, because it is useful in our work alone. Q. What does our Matter contain? A. It contains Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. Q. What operation is it most important to be able to perform?A. The successive extraction of the Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. Q. How is that done ? A. By sole and perfect sublimation. Q. What is in the first place extracted ? A. Mercury in the form of a white smoke. Q. What follows? A. Igneous water, or Sulphur. Q. What then? A. Dissolution with purified salt, in the first place volatilising that which is fixed, and afterwards fixing that which is volatile into a precious earth, which is the Vase of the Philosophers, and is wholly perfect. Q. When must the Philosopher begin his enterprise ? A. At the moment of daybreak, for his energy must never be relaxed. Q. When may he take his rest? A. When the work has come to its perfection. 174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Q. At what hour is the end of the work ? A. High noon, that is to say, the moment when the Sun is in its fullest power, and the Son of the Day-Star in its most brilliant splendour. Q. What is the pass-word of Magnesia? A. You know whether I can or should answer:--I reserve my speech. Q. Give me the greeting of the Philosophers. A. Begin ; I will reply to you. Q. Are you an apprentice Philosopher? A. My friends, and the wise, know me. Q. What is the age of a Philosopher ? A. From the moment of his research, to that of his discoveries, the Philosopher does not age. 175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" FIG 19 – Michael Sendivogius the alchemist who allegedly transcribed this Alchemical Catechism supposedly created by Paracelsus from a rare manuscript found in the Vatican Library, is another key figure of the Great Western Initiatic System.  The Secret Alchemical Instruction for creating the Antichrist Aleister Crowley's black magic centered upon Babalon, and he identified himself with the “Beast”, upon which Babalon is to ride in her conquest of the Earth. In his novel, The Moonchild, Crowley described the creation of a \"homunculus,\" described as \"a living being in form, resembling man, and possessing those qualities of man which distinguish him from beasts, namely intellect and power of speech, but neither begotten and born in the manner of human generation, nor inhabited by a human soul.” Crowley said this was “the great idea of magicians of all times: to obtain a Messiah by some adaptation of the sexual process.” Crowley's “Messiah” was the Antichrist who would overthrow Christianity: Babalon the Great. [31] To obtain this purpose he devised the IX Degree of the O.T.O. Illuminati, to create the perfect Moonchild. For most magicians, this is not going to happen; and if it does, it will more than likely be an abomination or a 176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"mockery of what might be termed a perfect Moonchild. Probably the most exalted example we have of a Moonchild in recent Earth history is the biblical Christ, but remember the O.T.O are on the dark side and are working to create exactly the opposite being, the Antichrist . Crowley was responsible for a prominent occult novel Moonchild (1917). This work conceptualizes his thoughts on what is essentially an analogue to the Christian Antichrist. The story follows a woman who is caught between two sects of Magicians, one group titled White and the other Black , who are organized into Lodges, also Black and White, who are at war with one another in the time period leading up to World War I. The White Lodge wants to improve the human race by creating the Moonchild, which is “the soul of an ethereal being” born into mankind. Using arcane sex rituals, the girl becomes pregnant with the Moonchild, despite all attempts by agents of the Black Lodge to prevent it. The Moonchild is then used by the White Lodge to fight the Black Lodge. However, at the end of the book, the White Lodge ends up supporting the Allied Powers and the Black supports the Central Powers in a strange twist that suggests the Moonchild may not be what the White Lodge would have the woman and the world believe. And, perhaps, the White Lodge is not all it seems either. The precise rituals (calle d The Babalon Working), used to bring about the birth of this so-called perfect or ethereal soul, are detailed pretty heavily in Moonchild, and, supposedly, according to The Secret History, attempts were made at a location called the Devil’s Gate in Arroyo Seco, Pasadena to bring this child forth. TP, in an annotation, says that in a letter from Crowley to Parsons, Crowley called the Devil’s Gate a hell gate and that was one of seven such gateways. The letter ends with Crowley suggesting Parsons use it. The inference to be made here is they attempted the ritual in that location. Hubbard does say that he “saw things not meant for man” but goes into no further detail. Crowley apparently attempted it as well, but not successfully. [32] Massimo Introvigne writes : Parsons expected the appearance of a “spirit” that would help him in his magical activities. In January 1946, a sculptress and painter, Marjorie Cameron (1922–1995), who, under the simple name of “Cameron”, would subsequently become a well-known artist, appeared at 1003, joined the lodge and came to live at 1003. Or so Parsons would later report. In fact, “Cameron had actually been at the house on South Orange Grove Avenue a short period before, but had not spoken with Parsons at that time”. Cameron quickly became the new lover of Parsons, and the latter 177"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"concluded that the magical operations undertaken with Hubbard had been successful. Cameron was indeed the “spirit” promised to him. With Cameron, Parsons began a new series of sex magic experiments. The purpose, this time, was the birth of a homunculus, both “artificial man” and vehicle of the Antichrist. Crowley himself had written a secret instruction on the homunculus, and it was to this being, that the novel Moonchild alluded. However, according to Crowley, not only the times were not mature, but also initiates of a much higher level than Parsons would have been necessary. Informed of the so-called “Babalon Working” the American scientist had started with Cameron and Hubbard, who acted as a “scribe” and took note of everything, Crowley wrote back that Parsons was simply “a fool”. Parsons continued all the same and went so far to produce a fourth chapter of the Book of the Law, although he probably never sent it to Crowley. He eventually parted company with Crowley and concluded that Cameron herself, rather than the child she was supposed to produce with him, was the incarnation of “the Thelemic goddess Babalon”. If it did not produce a homunculus, the “Babalon Working” at least generated a schism in the O.T.O. [33] James M. Martin wrote the following on the homunculus in ABRASAX (Texas 1993): Aleister Crowley's treatise on the making of a homunculus was couched in terms of a secret ritual for the IX° members of the O.T.O. It begins with the premise that the human ego reincarnates into a \"new tenement\" when the fetus is in its third month of gestation. One classical method involves removal of a woman's fertilized ovum and continuing the gestation ectopically. Crowley is characteristically vague about the details, however, throwing in a few alchemical allusions. The modern magickal method is another thing entirely. Crowley advises selection of a female partner whose horoscope is suited to the nature of whatever homunculus is desired. The magician and his mate \"copulate continuously\" until impregnation results; then, the woman is withdrawn to a desolate place where appropriate incantations are vibrated (e.g. the banishing formulae of the Sephiroth) five to seven times a day. The woman is \"constantly educated by words and by books and by pictures of a nature consonant\" to the spirit being evoked - the method of Liber Astarte (bhakti yoga). Delivery is somehow held up or pushed forward to assure the child an appropriate ascendant sign, and when the infant is born, it is immediately dedicated, purified, and consecrated to the incarnated spirit.

Massimo Introvigne, who is a self-declared Jesuit loyalist, definitely has an important role, as a sort of gatekeeper of New Age and Modern Satanism in today’s Western Initiatic world. He portrays a clear picture of the various manifestations of Modern Satanism mostly linked, as you can imagine, to the charismatic and dark figure of Aleister Crowley. Without Crowley, we would probably have a different Society today. Introvigne writes: Crowley spent several years in the United States, where he hoped to escape European controversies, raise the funds he badly needed, and gather his loyal followers, especially in California. There, Wilfred Talbot Smith (1885–1957) had founded a Church of Thelema in 1934, and in 1935, a Lodge Agapé of the O.T.O. whose celebrations of the ‘Gnostic Mass’ attracted the attention of the tabloids. Smith never mentioned the Devil in his writings and was not particularly interested in Crowley’s references to Satan. In 1941, Marvel Whiteside Parsons, a scientist, engineer and expert in explosives, who had legally changed his name from Marvel to John and was normally referred to as “Jack”, joined Smith’s lodge together with his wife Helen Cowley (1910–2003). The mother of the latter, Olga Helena Nelson Cowley (1885–1949), widowed since 1920, married Burton Ashley Northrup (1872–1946), of Pasadena, who ran a credit recovery agency but was also an agent, or at least an informer, for the U.S. military intelligence. From her second marriage, Olga had two daughters. One of them, Sarah Elizabeth “Betty” Northrup (1924–1997), joined the Smith- Parsons lodge at a very early age, on the impulse of her stepsister, with the magical name Soror Cassap. Parsons became in that period a well-known figure in his profession. He was a researcher at the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) and 179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"worked both for the American government and for private companies. For the government, Parsons and his colleagues carried out the experiments of Arroyo Seco, which were at the origins of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and had a primary role in the American space projects.

In recognition of these merits, in 1972, twenty years after his death, a crater on the Moon would be baptized with the name of Parsons. Perhaps the International Astronomical Union, which gave the name of Parsons to the crater, did not know that this engineer and scientist lived and died surrounded by the dubious fame of being a leading Satanist. Parsons was always attracted to radical and marginal movements. After having participated in the activities of a Communist cell at Cal Tech, he met Smith and joined the O.T.O. The lodge was under attack by the press as a congregation of subversives and Satanists, but this for Parsons counted as a recommendation. At the same time, Crowley and Smith were having differences on various topics, primarily on the money that the British magus, in deep financial troubles, believed he had the right to receive from his American disciples. Parsons thus attracted the attention of Crowley, who corresponded with him and became a source of inspiration for the writings of the Californian scientist. In 1942, Parsons, who was well paid by Cal Tech, rented a rather expensive home, called simply “1003”, at the address 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, in Pasadena’s “Millionaires’ Row”. It became the new “convent” or “profess house”, where a group of o.t.o. members started living communally. Among these were Smith, Parsons, his wife Helen and Helen’s stepsister Betty. Then, a soap opera developed. Parsons had started having intimate relations with Betty when the latter, who was now eighteen, was thirteen. His wife Helen finally discovered what was going on, and gave him a taste of his own medicine by starting a relationship with their superior in the O.T.O., Smith. When the Agapé Lodge moved to the new convent in Pasadena, Smith was already living openly with Helen, and Parsons with Betty. Crowley sardonically commented that the number 1003, the address of the home, was probably chosen as it coincided with the number of women conquered by Don Giovanni in the opera consecrated to him by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791). Crowley was everything but a moralist but was afraid that, between love triangles and even more complicated amorous polygons, things at number 1003 would end up badly. He instructed two people he trusted, both his future 180"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"successors at the guide of the main branch of the O.T.O., Karl Germer (1885–1962) and Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985), to keep him informed concerning what was going on in Pasadena. McMurtry, in particular, sent vitriolic reports, suspecting Smith of having an affair with his ex-wife, who lived in the “convent” in Pasadena, and that he had made her abort: a capital sin for Crowley, who was against abortion. In 1943, Germer, on behalf of Crowley, removed Smith from his office of superior of the Agapé Lodge, substituting him with Parsons. But the latter had his own problems. Cal Tech worked for the military. During both World War II and the Cold War it was kept under surveillance by the secret services. Parsons had already been investigated as a suspected Communist . In 1943, Betty eventually revealed to her parents that not only did she live with Parsons, but also she had started sleeping with him when she was thirteen. Her father, as one can imagine, was not happy. Since he had connections with the military intelligence services, he put them on Parsons’ trail, not only as a Communist but also as a dangerous “black magician” . In this context, a new character appeared. One of the high- level initiates of the Agapé Lodge was pianist and composer Roy Edward Leffingwell (1886– 1952). He had among his friends the science fiction writer Lafayette Ron Hubbard (1911–1986), who later would become famous as the founder of Dianetics and its successive religious development, the Church of Scientology .” Leffingwell persuaded Hubbard to join the Lodge, and in 1945, the writer went to live at 1003. Parsons reported to Crowley that Hubbard was an excellent swordsman and well-known in the California milieu of science fiction writers. Invited by Hubbard, even the prince of American science fiction, Robert Anson Heinlein (1907–1988), came to 1003 for a swordplay. McMurtry, always the gossip, commented that Hubbard preferred to train with Betty Northrup, and the two ended their duels by grappling “like a starfish on a clam”. Soon after, as McMurtry had correctly predicted, Betty left Parsons’ bedroom to transfer to that of Hubbard. Parsons suffered privately but declared that in the O.T.O. women were free and there was no place for jealousy. He even asked Hubbard to help him to accomplish a series of rituals in the Mojave Desert, based on the Enochian system of magic but also on energetic magical masturbation. [35] In one of probably the most celebrated feats in “Magickal history”, Parsons and pre-Dianetics/Scientology L. Ron Hubbard, performed The infamous Babalon Working, a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of time and space and intended to bring about, in Parsons' own words, “love, 181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"understanding, and Dionysian freedom [...] the necessary counterbalance or correspondence to the manifestation of Horus.” Parsons died in an explosion in the late 1940s, and some well-informed sources say Hubbard might be the one to blame, however, before he died under mysterious circumstances, he secured a place for The Great Beast 666 in American culture. In the late 1940s, the Berkeley O.T.O. branch was frequented by actor and director Kenneth Anger (b. 1930). Anger’s interest in occultism runs deep, and his interest in Crowley is obsessive. In his effort to understand The Great Beast, Anger went on a 1950s pilgrimage to Crowley’s old commune in Sicily and made a film based on Crowleyian principles entitled, Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954). Many years later, Anger would become a household name for penning the pop culture masterpiece Hollywood Babylon (1981), the first book to expose the rampant homosexuality and deviancy in the film industry and a must-read for anyone interested in American cultural history. No one can deny that Kenneth Anger is a talented filmmaker and writer, even though one may strongly disagree with his philosophy. Anger is still involved in Crowleyanity and is one of the major promoters of The Great Beast’s worldview. However, Anger has a very low opinion of those groups who claim to be the legitimate heirs of Crowley’s O.T.O. In a rather recent interview, the late Anger lamented: ...I'm not too keen on any group or cult. I've been to meet the various groups who call themselves OTO which Crowley founded. But Crowley never 'anointed' them or approved of them. All the groups are fighting with each other. There's been raids, thefts, houses have been broken into, books have been stolen, one house was burned down. These are Crowleyites fighting among each other and I'm ashamed of them . Crowley is hugely popular today -- more so than during his lifetime. In 1967, he appeared on the cover of The Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band . In a 2002 BBC survey of the 100 Greatest Britons, Crowley ranked number 73 . The Berkeley O.T.O. had a San Franciscan member named Howard Stanton Levey (1930-1997), who began frequenting the lodge in 1951. Levey was in correspondence with Jack Parsons in the late 1940s and was an eager student of the occult. His background is somewhat shrouded in mystery, primarily because he misrepresented his early life and work when he was later to emerge as a major figure in occult circles. It is clear, however, that Levey was a musician who played keyboard at various 182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"burlesque houses and nightclubs in the Bay Area in the 1950s. Levey and Anger became fast friends in the O.T.O., and shared an interest in the more nefarious side of life. The two men intensely studied such phenomena as werewolves, vampires, tarot, ESP and essentially every other occult and mystical teaching under the sun. By 1961, they began to hold meetings at Levey’s house, where they charged for public lectures on occultism which attracted fairly large crowds. Much of Levey’s motivation for starting this occult club, was the 1947 novel (and film) Nightmare Alley by William Lindsay Gresham, about a carnival huckster who starts a phony spiritualist church to con money out of “rubes”. (Ironically, Gresham’s wife Joy went on to marry Christian author C. S. Lewis!) As the public decency laws began to change in California, burlesque houses were allowed to offer topless and eventually fully nude dancing. Levey was already ingrained in the adult entertainment industry as a keyboard player in the older burlesque club scene. As a means to earn money, Levey recruited dancers and organized strip shows in San Francisco. According to his daughter, Zeena, he often turned to pimping women in San Francisco’s red light district, called the Tenderloin. In 1966, Levey formulated a scheme by which he could combine his favorite interests -- sex, money, and magick. With Anger’s blessing, Levey shaved his head, donned black clothing, and announced the formation of the Church of Satan. He also changed his name to Anton Szandor LaVey and declared himself to be The Black Pope and The Devil’s Avenger. In order to have a secure base of operation, LaVey painted his house black and designed an elaborate ritual chamber which would act as the headquarters for the new diabolical church. LaVey went on a publicity blitz which afforded him celebrity status in the growing 1960s counterculture. Over the course of the next few years, LaVey gathered a fairly large following of about 2000 members worldwide with around 500 or 600 of these being serious hardcore devotees. [36] This was the beginning of the evolution of Modern Satanism in the United States, a dangerous and evil current that will eventually bring us all the way to the public diableries of The Satanic Temple. 183"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" The Masonic roots of th e Ordo Templi Orientis The Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis Misraim (A.P.R.M.M.) or Memphis Mizraim is a significant part of the Ordo Templi Orientis phenomenon. In reality, the early version of the O.T.O. had included a part of the system of the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm in their new Para-Masonic body. In fact, one of the basic pillars of the Ordo Templi Orientis, founded by Theodor Reuss at the beginning of the 20th. century, was the charter he’d received and bought from JohnYarker (1833-1913) of the Antient and Primitive Scottish Rite, and the Memphis-Misraim Rite . For this reason, many O.T.O. members erroneously consider themselves to be Freemasons, and, as such, they are often derided for their erroneous presumption by real Freemasons. So, who was John Yarker? Another wrongly perceived charlatan? Well, I will use the words of VW Bro John Hamill, PGSwdB , current Deputy Grand Chancellor of the United Grand Lodge of England to clear this matter once and for all : Yarker was neither a degree-monger nor a charlatan, for he believed what he wrote, that the many degrees he had discovered all predated regular Freemasonry. He never invented evidence but accepted, uncritically, the invented evidence of others. His desperate attempt to ensure the continuance of the Ancient and Primitive Rite led him into the company of the fraud, Theodore Reuss, and Aleister Crowley.Expelled from the Ancient and Accepted Rite, he severed all connection with regular Freemasonry and later published The Arcane Schools: a review of their origin and antiquity; with a general history of Freemasonry, and its relation to the theosophic, scientific and philosophic mysteries, (Belfast: 1909); and was publisher of The Kneph, the official journal of the Antient and Primitive Rite, from 1881 to 1900. Author of 26 short papers in the Transactions of Quatuor Coronati Lodge No. 2076, he was an active 184"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"promoter of the Royal Arch, Ancient and Primitive Rite, Knights Templar, and the old York degrees of Heredom-Kadosh. [37] The 3º degree (Master Magician) is in the O.T.O system compatible to the Master Mason degree of general Freemasonry (Blue Lodge). Reuss published an alleged transcript of his Charter in his private magazine Oriflamme (the issue of December 1902 mentions the 33°, 90°, and 96°), the original Charter extant mentions the degrees 30°-33° (without M.M.) only for which Reuss has permission to give. Nevertheless, Reuss assumed making regular Freemasons through his compilation of Orders a practice typical of fringe Masonry. In 1917, he would render some A.A.S.R. and M.M. degrees into the O.T.O., founded in 1906. As O.T.O. historian Peter-R. Koenig clearly points out, Reuss was an Anglo-German Freemason who was, and still is regarded, by historians and Freemasons alike as a swindler, whom imported the “fringe-masonic” organization of French origin, Alte und Primitive Ritus von Memphis und Misraim (henceforth M.M.) and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite (A.A.S.R.) via England to Germany in 1902. At that time the German organizations he presided had no definite name (they altered according to Reuss’ mood or growing collection of Orders) but was declared to be founded on Harry J. Seymour’s Cerneau charter (a 33° rite) of 21 July 1862. Theodor Reuss was busy selling and buying masonic charters. Clearly, potential members want to associate with an “authentic” Order or Lodge. “Authenticity” means “regularity”: permissions, charters, successions, constitutions and the like. In order to be called “regular”one needs a permission of a “regular” superior Mother or Grand Lodge. Until 1900 there were over 70 so-called High degree systems pretending to be continuations or extensions of the regular Craft Masonry. The only difference between all these systems was the 400 or more different names of the various degrees. This environment is the dwelling ground for those who abused their masonic powers by selling charters etc. (in a similar way to the current trade in minor ‘artistocratic’ titles). For Peter-R. Koenig, Reuss invented several new Orders, and basically made little more than a confused mess with all of them. The Illuminati like to create such confusion, in order to make their real mission and work more difficult to perceive and understand for the profane. Reuss was responsible for the construction of the O.T.O. between 1906 and 1912, a clone of Craft Masonry, A.A.S.R., M.M., and Tantra that he had put together with the help of the late Carl Kellner (1851-1905), a member of John Yarker's Rite of Memphis-Misraim. Franz Hartmann's 185"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"obituary of Kellner describes that in 1902 Kellner “..was personally initiated in Manchester by Brother Yarker into the 96°, and made Sovereign Honorary General Grand Master of our Order.” Reuss also invented a new “Order of the Illuminati” and several Rosicrucian societies. Reuss turned his collection of Orders into a huge non-transparent turmoil where every organisation seemed to be interweaved and linked. Its names varied according to the time of day, some members were co-members of several Reuss-Orders, others weren’t. Neither Reuss or his self-styled heirs have ever appeared to be interested in clarifying the confusion. Therefore, at the time it became widely accepted (and still is today by some) that membership in one of Reuss’ Orders equates to membership in all the others as well. Regular Freemasonry rejects all of Reuss’ activities, especially the O.T.O. which accepts women in its lodges: impossible in traditional Masonry. In 1904 and it is probably around this time that Reuss’ decided to recruit from several A.A.S.R. (33° degrees) and M.M. (90° and 97° degrees) members as a ‘chosen few’ for his new emerging Order, the later O.T.O. (11 degrees). There was no proper name at this time — sometimes he spoke of the Oriental Freemasons or Order of Old Templar Freemasons (expressions also used in the A.A.S.R. context). The Memphis-Rite alone was sometimes called “Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry”, or even “Oriental Order of Memphis”. When Reuss founded the “Order of Oriental Templars” there was a further confusion just around the corner — who was in which of Reuss’ Orders? And wasn’t the Memphis-Rite alone called “Oriental Templars”? How were they linked? Was an O.T.O.- member automatically an M.M.-member? Between 1906 and 1913 (following the death of John Yarker, worldwide head of M.M., in 1913 the position was confused) the O.T.O. unequivocably was distinct from all of Reuss’ other Orders. When Reuss spoke of “Our Order” it remained completely unclear which Order he meant. But it is historically senseless to assume the O.T.O., which at this time, was a sort of collective Order which siphoned its members from A.A.S.R., M.M., Order of the Illuminati, regular Masonry, the Gnostic Catholic Church, the Rosicrucians, the Golden Dawn, etc.. It was not until 1917, when Reuss and his self-proclaimed heir, Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) considered the O.T.O., M.M. and the A.A.S.R. as linked, for example, 33°, 90°-95°, which were equal to the IX° O.T.O. [this is substantiated with Crowley's “Synopsis of Degrees” in his handwritten version of his IV°. O.T.O. degree. For Koenig, in today’s 186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"O.T.O., all this Masonic background is mirrored in its rituals, in its language, passwords, and grips. The interested researcher will find in rare books like O.T.O. Rituals and Sex Magick, a choice of Reuss’ original O.T.O. initiation rituals (Scottish Rite, Cerneau, Royal Arch, Rose Croix, and Memphis-Mizraim derivations) that have been later altered by Aleister Crowley for his English branch. Reuss never used Crowley's rituals re-modelled between 1912 and 1918 and wanted the Ordo Templi Orientis and Crowley’s “Thelemic” concept of the Order to be kept strictly separated. There is evidence that suggests Crowley was probably expelled from the O.TO. in 1921. [38] For some historians of Freemasonry, the OrdoTempli Orientis (O.T.O.) was originally founded already back in 1895, not only with the help of Carl Kellner but also of Heinrich Klein and known Rosicrucian Franz Hartmann. However, only when Theodor Reuss succeeded Kellner as chief it apparently became a real operative order and not a “Mickey Mouse Club” of some sort. This version of the events is course questionable, nevertheless, Kellner had travelled in the Orient, and brought back with him Tantric knowledge and such, later used by Reuss who was more of a typical continental Illuminati occultist and fringe-Mason. Among else, Reuss was chartered for this new Illuminati project (i.e. the O.T.O.) by Westcott of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, John Yarker of the Memphis-Mizraim, and Leopold Engel (1858-1931) co- founder in the revived Illuminati Order. Reuss energic efforts spread the O.T.O. throughout the world. Many famous occultists of the time were in one way or the other linked to Reuss or the O.T.O., as for instance; Papus, Rudolph Steiner, Jack W. Parsons, Ron L. Hubbard, Gerald Gardner, George Plummer, Israel Regardie, Ben Kadosch (Carl Willhelm Hansen) [1872-1936], Heinrich Traenker, Friedrich Mellinger [1890-1970] and many many more. In 1905, the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis- Misraim was introduced into Germany from England by John Yarker, 97°, who was then the Grand Hierophant of the Rite. The first German leaders were Carl Kellner and Theodor Reuss who created a magical order known as the Ordo Templi Orientis by means of a reduction of the magical grades of the Rite of Memphis-Misraim from 97° to 9°, with a 10th grade, which was purely administrative. In 1902, the Theodor Reuss established the Sovereign Sanctuary of Memphis-Misraïm in Germany and in 1913, after the death of Yarker, he became the International Head of the Rite. 187"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"In 1924, Reuss died and the succession was interrupted, except in the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis), the neo-templar order founded by Reuss, in 1905, in Germany. In reality, the O.T.O. had included the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm, although in a reduced version of 33° degrees, where its principle degrees were incorporated. In 1908 Krumm-Heller who will later found the F.R.A. in the 1920’s received the Memphis-Misraim grades of 90° and 95° from Theodor Reuss in Paris. He was a disciple of Bishop Clement (under Bricaud's aegis), and of the Martinist Girgois (in Buenos Aires), Papus, and the American Peter Davidson of the H.B. of L, Krumm- Heller would later set up a number of Memphis & Mizraim Temples in South America under Papus' jurisdiction. Krumm-Heller not only befriended Reuss but also Franz Hartmann and the high-grade Mexican freemason Don Jesus Medina connected to Aleister Crowley. In 1909, Theodor Reuss delivered a licence to the famous Martinist Gerard Encauss (Papus). Encausse never became a regular (Grand Orient) Freemason. Despite this, he organized what was announced as an International Masonic Conference in Paris on June 24, 1908 , and at this conference, he first met Theodor Reuss, and the two men apparently exchanged patents. Reuss elevated Encausse as X° of the Ordo Templi Orientis as well as giving him license to establish a Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Ancient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris. For his part, Encausse assisted Reuss in the formation of the O.T.O. Gnostic Catholic Church as a child of l'Église Gnostique de France, thus forming the E.G.C. within the tradition of French neo-gnosticism. The successors of Papus were Charles Detré (Tedé), Jean Bricaud, Constant Chevillon, Charles-Henry Dupont and Robert Ambelain. In 1939, Jean Bricaud passed to the Eternal East and was followed by Chevillon. In 1944, Chevillon was murdered by the French collaborationists of national-socialism and was followed by Dupont. And, in 1960, Ambelain succeeded Dupont. [39] As one of the great French esotericists of the latter half of the 20th Century Robert Ambelain , who was directly involved in this fringe Masonic tradition, is probably one of the best sources we can refer to further explaining the complex history of the two Rites of Memphis and Misraïm, that commemorated their second centenary in 1988. In origin, the fusion of the two Rites of Misraïm and Memphis was undertaken in 1881 by Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was the first Grand Master-General, but not necessarily a great esoterist, as recently underlined by Italian researcher Fortunato Luciano Sciandra. Here are 188"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"some extracts from Robert Ambelain’s writings, to clear up a few points on the history of these rites that will later became one, and also on Napoleon’s role in all this: “The Rite of M IZRAÏM had been constituted in 1778 at Venice; it took its line from C AGLIOSTRO , who had himself received the lower grades from the Grand Lodge of E NGLAND , and the high grades of German Templar Masonry. The Rite of M EMPHIS was constituted at Montauban in 1815 by Masons who had participated in the Mission to Egypt with Bonaparte. From his accession to the imperial purple, Napoleon Bonaparte was proclaimed and considered to be a genuine Freemason in his lifetime, as were his father, his brothers and his Marshals. In his book The Freemasonry of Bonaparte (Payot edition 1982), François Collaveri showed the considerable role of Lodges in the diffusion of the great ideals of the French Revolution across Europe. “I am a man of the Revolution...” , the Emperor had declared. In 1986 the same author assembled all the proofs of his belonging to the Masonic Order in a second volume: Napoleon, Emperor Freemason (Tallandier edition 1986). All the documents, with the very important witness of the archives of the Grand- Orient de France of former times, affirm that the initiation of Napoleon Bonaparte took place in Egypt. To those we can add the documentation published by us in Number 1 of the magazine L’Initiation in 1979, an article which included the recall of a letter of Grand Master Constant Chevillon , dated November 10 th 1934, confirming to Grand Master Fletcher of the USA that Napoleon Bonaparte had been received as a Mason in a Lodge in Cairo, which brought together the Masonic members of the Mission to Egypt, and that Kléber presided, the Lodge carrying the name Isis. These were the Masons, or their successors, who thereafter formally constituted the Rite of Memphis at Montauban in 1815. From this period, violet became the Masonic color of its rituals, blue being that of the Rite Français and blue edged with red that of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite. Violet constituted a reminder of the color of Parma violets, the duchy where the little king of Rome resided, then four years old.” [40] For Ambelain, “The Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm associated the violet of these origins with the turquoise blue attributed to great Isis in ancient Egypt, thus joining together a double esoteric symbolism. This is why Napoleon was one of the very first Masons of this Rite of Memphis. And the Emperor never forgot that he had “received light” on the antique soil of holy initiation. This is why he also adopted the Bee as a symbol of his reign, with the Eagle. The bee was the image of Pharaoh in 189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"ancient Egypt, and two wings of an eagle flank the Osirian sun. Finally, a comment by the Emperor to Josephine has been reported by one of her intimate friends, the celebrated Mlle Lenormand in her Memoirs: I have consumed my life in a continual movement which hasn’t allowed me to fulfill my duties as an initiate of the Egyptian sect. (Cf. Mémoires historiques et secrets de l’Impératrice Joséphine , Paris 1920). Other initiatic Grades coming from the ancient esoteric Obediences of the 18 th Century were associated with these two Obediences: the P RIMITIVE Rite, Rite of the P HILADELPHIANS , etc. In the 19 th Century, M IZRAÏM and M EMPHIS were the two Obediences from which the Carbonari were recruited. They had numerous Lodges in France and counted among their dignitaries very important people, including the Duc de D ECAZES and Compte M URAIRE , Grand Commander of the S COTTISH Rite to mention but two. At the present time in International Masonry M EMPHIS - M IZRAÏM can count around five thousand five hundred members, grouped in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Venezuela, Haiti), Australia, and Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, France). In France the Obedience is above all a place of assembly for Masons who are generally in the higher grades, who belong to the G RAND -O RIENT DE F RANCE , to the G RANDE L OGE DE F RANCE , to the G RANDE L OGE N ATIONALE F RANÇAISE “Opéra”, and who are joined by a mutual attraction to Esotericism, Occultism, Symbolism, etc. It is in sum a crossroads or meeting-place. However, except in France it only has about thirty Lodges, not including the higher Lodges where one can find those Masons of all Obediences who are most qualified in the realm of the Occult and Esotericism; and some of these are in fact, the heads of other Organizations of this genre, which are more secretive. Moreover, the Rite of M EMPHIS - M IZRAÏM continues the tradition of adhering to those principles of tolerance and freedom of thought which in the 19 th Century, during the White Terror, made it the refuge and nursery of the Carbonari.” [41] Regarding the Rite of Mizraim instead, for Ambelain “it appeared for the first time in Venice in 1788. A group of Socinians (an anti-Trinitarian Protestant sect) requested a patent from Cagliostro, then from Trente. Not wishing to practice the magical-kabbalistic rituals of the latter, they chose to work the Templar Rite. Cagliostro thus gave them only Masonic light; he held the first three Degrees of English Masonry and the higher Grades of German Masonry which were strongly marked by the templar tradition. The name Mizraïm is simply the plural of Egyptian, the only reminder of this Egyptian Rite which transmitted to them the authority for the 190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Obedience. It hived off rapidly to Milan, Genoa, Naples and appeared in France through Michel Bédarride, who have received the magisterial powers in 1810 in Naples, from Bro. De Lassalle. From 1810 to 1811 the three Bédarride brothers successfully developed the Rite in France, to all intents and purposes under the protection of the Scottish Rite. Indeed, it could count several illustrious Masonic names at its head: the Comte Muraire, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, the Duc Decazes, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Leicester, Lieutenant-General Baron Teste, etc. Just before the White Terror it quickly became the Masonic Obedience which transmitted the required mastership to the Carbonari, and this Rite amassed 22 Lodges in Paris, 6 at Lyons, 6 at Metz, 5 in Toulouse, 3 I Bordeaux, 3 in Geneva, 2 in Lausanne, and 1 at Courtray. Violently anticlerical 5 , antiroyalist, the police of the Restoration had it dissolved. Clandestine for eighteen years, it was restored in 1838, only to be dissolved once more in 1841. It arose once more from a clandestine existence in 1848. Mizraïm made its way towards joining with the Rite of Memphis in 1881, a fusion which was the work of Garibaldi.Regarding instead the Rite of Memphis the majority of members who accompanied Bonaparte on the Mission of Egypt were Masons from the ancient initiatic Rites: the Philalethes, the African Brethren, the Hermetic Rite, the Philadelphians, the Primitive Rite, not to mention the Grand-Orient de France. Having discovered a gnostic-hermetic survival in Cairo, and then the Druze Masonry encountered by Gérard de Nerval in Lebanon which could be traced back to the Operative Masons who had accompanied the Templars – their protectors – there, the Brothers in the Mission to Egypt, decided henceforth to renounce their Masonic lineage which came from the Grand Lodge in London and to set out once more in a new Rite, which owed nothing to England, then Enemy Number One.” [42] Thus, for Ambelain, “under the guidance of Samuel Honis and Marconis de Nègre, the Rite of Memphis was born in Montauban, in 1815. With great speed, just as the Rite of Mizraïm had brought together nostalgic Jacobeans and the Carbonari, the Rite of Memphis regrouped those in the pay of the ex- Grand Army and the Bonaparte-ists who remained loyal to the Eagle. In 1816 the two Rites had the same Grand Master-General, which would permit a future fusion. But the Grand-Orient was still mainly composed of monarchists, its seal carrying the fleur de lys, and it secured the dissolution of Memphis. This did not last, and in 1826 this Rite took up its labors once more under the Obedience of the selfsame Grand-Orient. Dissolved in 1841, just like Mizraïm, Memphis also became clandestine, 191"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"and only reappeared in plain view in 1848 with the Republic. Dissolved once more in 1850, reawakened in 1853, Memphis joined the Grand- Orient in 1862, compelled to by a decision of the Prince- President. Having many Lodges abroad by now, it attracted illustrious names, such as Louis Blanc and Garibaldi, who was soon to be the unifier of Memphis and Mizraïm. Up to 1881, the Rites of Memphis and Mizraïm proceeded in parallel and in concert, in a very extraordinary atmosphere; indeed, these Rites both began to gather Masons from the Grand-Orient de France and the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite who were interested in studies pertaining to the esotericism of Masonic symbolism, gnosis, Kabbalah also Hermeticism and occultism. Now, these two Rites were the inheritors and depositaries of the old initiatic Obediences of the 18 th Century: the Philalethes, the Philadelphians, the Hermetic Rite, the Primitive Rite, etc. And all this was represented in Mizraïm in 90 different grades, and in Memphis, by 95. How to administrate and make use of this great disparate ensemble? When Giuseppe Garibaldi was designated first Grand Master- General ad vitam for the entire world (since Brothers abroad had not suffered political persecution as in France), he established a type of classification which was not at all hierarchical in the beginning, but which quickly became so. In fact, the 95 degrees of the Rite of Memphis- Mizraïm should be considered to be an ambulatory, where the old Masonic degrees which were no longer or rarely practiced, and not as a series of values, are to be found. Moreover, the accords of 1863 with the Grand- Orient of France, and 1896 with the Symbolic Scottish Grand Lodge, the future Grand Lodge of France only treated on the 33 classic degrees (the Rite of Perfection, followed by the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite). The higher echelons of Memphis-Mizraïm compulsorily practiced: the 9 th Degree (Master-Elect of Nine), 18 th Degree (Knight Rose-Croix), 30 th Degree (Knight Kadosh), 32 nd Degree (Prince of the Royal Secret), 33 rd Degree (Sovereign Grand Inspector-General).” [43] For Ambelain the 66 th , 90 th and 95 th degrees were conferred as honorific titles on senior Masons, in recompense for their valor and fidelity. The other degrees (Secret Master, Royal Arch, etc) are optional and left to the discretion of the Brothers of higher degrees. As the late Robert Ambelain explained in detail, today, the Rite of Memphis-Mizraïm comprises around 5,500 Masons worldwide, the majority of laborers being located in South America. It possesses around a hundred Symbolic Lodges for the first three grades (not counting the higher echelons) in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, 192"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Venezuela, Australia, etc. Since the General Grand Mastership of Garibaldi, the position has been successively secured by Theodore Reuss (also Grand Master of the Grand-Orient of Germany), Doctor Gérard Encausse (Papus), Charles Détré (alias Teder), Jean Bricaud, Constant Chevillon, Charles-Henry Dupont, Robert Ambelain, and the late Gérard Kloppel from 1984 to 2008. In 1964 a grand Convent-General of the Lodges of South America decided that the seat of the General Grand Mastership would be obligatorily in Paris, and a Convent-General of the Lodgories of Europe ratified this vote in 1965. The Convent of South America also expressed the wish that the Grand Master-General should obligatorily be French. This appears to be more difficult to impose. Remembering its deaths (the Grand Master Chevillon was assassinated by the Vichy Militia, and his Belgian alter ego, Brother Delaive, was decapitated with a hatchet by the Nazis), this Rite perpetuates their tradition of fidelity to democratic principles and to the initiatic sciences. Uncompromisingly Deist, it makes the definition of “Masonic religion” laid out in Anderson’s Constitutions of 1723 and considered in “general morality of honest men” its own. Its Symbolic Lodges work the Templar Rite (Mizraïm) or the Egyptian Rite (Memphis), but on their altars, they join the Ruler with the traditional interlacing of the Compass and Square. [44]    Robert Ambelain was such a knowledgeable Freemason and esoterist, he actually completely reinvented the Elus Coën (sometimes misspelled “Elus Kohen” or “Cohen”), of Martinez de Pasqually, that he revived after the second world war, but since then it has existed a great confusion regarding the Elus Coën because of Ambelain incomplete knowledge ranging from how the very name of the order was actually spelled, to how its system of initiation was composed. Robert Ambelain was convinced that the order represented a priesthood of the old testament, the levittic Kohanim, that supervised the cult of the Temple in Jerusalem. He further filled the many holes in the tradition he sought to revive with either kabbalah or foreign elements from Memphis-Misraïm. Before he died Ambelain discovered and donated to the Bibliothèque nationale de France the manuscrit d'Alger, [45] that will eventually rectify this pseudo approach to the Elus Coën in due time, once the original rituals of the Elus Coën will be fully translated and made available to the interested parties. Why are the Elus Coën Illuminati so important? Well they are considered still one of the most influential esoteric orders of the Western Initiatic System, and the original rituals that gradually surfaced 193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"from the manuscrit d'Alger seem pretty interesting, especially in regards to the harshness of their female initiation with phrases like: What are you doing among us, a treacherous woman like the Serpent?

I have discovered all your past plans and I know in you all those you can still commit; O’ Eve, Eve, far from being now seduced by your false and vain appearances, you will be subject to me and my dependence. Probably today’s Elus Coën could find this part a bit difficult to digest after the advent of feminism.  Chapter Four More Illuminati Secrets exposed for the first time Initiation and telepathy in the Illuminati Many of you may have become aware at a certain point in your life, that certain situations are not always as they appear in plain sight. The simple fact is, I didn’t learn about this in school, I wasn’t told about it, it was a sudden comprehension, like the opening of an eye, or like suddenly understanding another language. This is the phenomena I call “life initiation”, because it's not a slow process like the one we receive with traditional “education”, but a seemingly more immediate one. An 194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"“initiation” is, in fact, an abrupt transformation in your perception of reality, where you are revealed things that you didn't know before. Telepathic communication is evidenced in the same way, by sudden comprehension of things one never learned about through formal education or life experience. Tuning into the telepathic realm is achieved often by contemplating various passages in scripture, which activates portals in the mind, through which information flows. Spontaneous telepathy often occurs when meeting people, friends or strangers, and being able to mysteriously anticipate what they are about to say, or about to do. While these things happen to many people without any initiation at all, it simply becomes more frequent for the initiated person in a certain ambience. The Illuminati, in fact, communicate telepathically with each other, and their Invisible Masters through the centuries, by using various tools , like secret symbols and text, which, when contemplated in their lodges and Chapters, set the mind in a certain receptive state to send and receive messages that transcend time and space. Most initiatic symbols are all around us every day, and various texts have been produced throughout the ages that contain them, and are now of course widely available on the internet. But, until initiated into one of the Illuminati sects or mystery schools, they are often meaningless to the average individual, who sees views them according to his own perception, and not for their true initiatic meaning. This is often why these symbols become only a mechanism to open the mind of the average New Ager, rather than a true understanding of their special initiatic meaning. This is why New Age philosophy can only be defined as a subject without clear definition or purpose. Yes, it does relate to metaphysical subjects, but only in a general way, losing its original spiritual properties and becoming only a tool of the system, on a useless journey to simply waste our time or absorb our energy. To fully comprehend the truth of the Matrix surrounding us, one must be truly initiated by a valid Master. However, a partial understanding is possible by people of general intelligence. For example, I consider, as some of you already know, my books, especially my Confessions series, as a possible alternative path to facilitate self- initiation. Unlike Freemasons, who must keep everything secret, under the threat of various penalties, the Illuminati have no need to attempt to keep secrets and you want to know why? The truth is that the initiator himself simply decides who will comprehend or not his lesson, deciding who are the ones who can completely know the 195"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"truth, and who will remain partly blind because of their lack of preparation. So the Illuminati secrets are kept, not by any material actions or threats on their part, but by the very design of their initiatic system and the way it spreads its secrets and revelations to the right people, avoiding those who are not ready or too ignorant to understand. In his book, Perspectives on Initiation , Guénon clarifies the significance given by the ancient Greeks to the classical names of lesser and greater mysteries: “they are not different \"types\" of initiations, but stages or degrees of the same initiation”. Hermes' Caduceus is an example of a symbol associated to the possession of lesser mysteries, and showing an example of horizontal duality (the two snake heads are placed in the horizontal dual position, hence referring to apparent dualities such as life and death). In Studies in Hinduism , René Guénon mentions a relation between the symbol and the Kundalini Shakti. Lesser mysteries lead to the “ perfection of the human state ”, or in other words, to something traditionally designated by the restoration of the “primordial state\", a state that Dante, in the Divine comedy , relates symbolically to the terrestrial paradise. On the other hand, “greater mysteries” refer to “the realization of supra-human states”; they correspond to the Hindu doctrine of “deliverance” (Moksha) and to what Islamic esoterism calls the “realization of the Universal Man”: in that latter tradition, \"lesser\" and \"greater\" mysteries correspond exactly to the signification of the terms “el-insân el-qadîm” and “el-insan el-kâmil”. These two phases are related to an interpretation of the symbolism of the cross with the notions of “horizontal” and “vertical”. They also correspond respectively to what is traditionally designated in western hermeticism by the terms royal initiation and sacerdotal initiation: Pure metaphysical knowledge relates consequently, to “greater mysteries,” and the knowledge of traditional sciences to the \"lesser mysteries\". From a historical perspective, the “lesser mysteries” being merely a preparation to the \"greater mysteries\" [...] ultimately one has to go back beyond the very origin of humanity, and this is why a question such as a “historical” origin of initiation appears to be devoid of the least signification. The traditional sciences, whose knowledge provides restoration of “primordial state” are known under the name of cosmological sciences: among them, one can quote alchemy, astrology, the science of letters, and 196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"more generally, what is referred under the name Hermeticism. In the West, the Brothers of the Rose-Cross were beings that had effectively achieved the completion of lesser mysteries, and Rosicrucian initiation inspired by them was a particular form linked to Christian Hermeticism. René Guénon writes moreover that this Rosicrucian initiation is lost today, and is completely unrelated to the various modern organizations bearing the name Rosicrucian, as they belong to modern fallacies falling under the general denomination of pseudo-initiation given by Guénon to them. Telepathy, meaning Thought-Transference, bears a misleading title. Literally translated, it means “suffering at a distance,” or, perhaps, “feeling pain at a distance.” The name should really indicate “knowing at a distance,” in order to be properly descriptive. But as the term has acquired a forced meaning by reason of years of usage, it will probably be continued in popular favor. After all, names do not count, so long as the meaning is accepted and understood. [46] While the term itself has been generally used in the sense of conscious and deliberate sending and receiving of thought-waves, there is a far wider field of phenomena covered by it, the unconscious sending and receiving of mental and emotional vibrations. I shall discuss this subject in a moment, for now, I would like to call your attention to the mechanism whereby the waves of thought and emotion are transmitted. In the previous chapter, you will recall that there is a manifestation of energy or force (in the form of vibrations) in every mental or emotional state. This is true not only in the case of deep thought or vivid feeling but also in the case of general mental feelings and emotional states. During such manifestations, there is a radiation of mental or emotional vibrations from the brain or nervous centers of that particular system, that flow in all directions, just as light and wireless electricity. The principle seats or centers of these radiations exist in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata, respectfully; and several great centers of nerve substance in the human system, called the plexi, such as the solar plexus, etc. 197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The vibrations arising from emotional excitement are sent out principally from the plexi, or great centres of the sympathetic nervous system. Those arising from the more strictly mental states emanate from certain centers and points of the brain of the person manifesting them. Certain forms of these vibrations constitute the real essence of what is generally called “human magnetism,” which will be discussed further on. I do not think it advisable to go into the technical details of the generation and mechanism of transmission of these thought and emotional vibrations, in these lessons. To understand them would require a technical knowledge of physiology and organic chemistry, which is not possessed by the average person. Moreover, such details are neither interesting nor instructive to the general student of occultism. But, I think it proper to give at least a brief description of the receiving of such vibratory-waves by individuals. In the first place, every great plexus, or groups of nerve ganglia, in the human system is a receiving station, as well as a sending station. A person manifesting strong emotional excitement tends to awaken similar states in the nervous centers of other persons in whom the conditions are favorable. This explains why the vibrations of anger, fear, panic, are so contagious. It also explains the strong effect of the vibrations emanating from the nerve centers controlling the reproductive system, in certain cases of strong sexual excitement. Each human sympathetic nervous system contains many receiving stations where emotional vibrations are received, and where they tend to be transformed into similar feeling in the receiving system unless neutralized by other mental and emotional states in the person. When we come to consider the apparatus by which they are received, the vibrations arising from what may be called \"purely mental\" operations of the brain, such as intellectual thought, constructive imagination, etc., we find a more specialized arrangement, as might be expected. The principal apparatus for receiving thought vibrations of this kind is that which is known as the \"pineal gland,\" which I shall now describe. The pineal gland is a peculiar mass of nervous substance which is embedded in the human brain, in a position near the middle of the skull almost directly above the extreme top of the spinal column. It is shaped like a small cone and is of a reddish-gray color. It lies in front of the cerebellum and is attached to the floor of the third ventricle of the brain. It contains a small quantity of peculiar particles of gritty, sand-like substance, which are sometimes called “brain- sand.” It derives its scientific name from its 198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"shape, which resembles a pine-cone. Physiologists are vague in regards to the function of this strange organ, and generally content themselves with the statement that, “its functions are not understood.” But occultists know that the pineal gland, with its peculiar arrangement of nerve-cell corpuscles, and its tiny grains of “brain-sand,” is the physical telepathic receiving instrument. Students of wireless telegraphy have noticed a startling resemblance between the pineal gland, and a part of the receiving instrument employed in wireless telegraphy. The thought vibrations that come in contact with the nervous system of the receiving person, set up a peculiar vibration in the substance of the pineal gland, and thus the first step in the transformation of these vibrations into thought-forms in the mind of the person is underway. The student will do well to learn the idea of the workings of wireless telegraphy, for this will set up the right conception of the working of ordinary telepathy, without the necessity of complicated technical diagrams and descriptions. Let’s understand what results from the sending forth, and receiving of these mental and emotional waves of force and energy. While the phenomena of the astral plane is probably more fascinating to the average student, I would impress upon you the importance of mastering the occult phenomena of the physical plane, before passing on to that of the higher planes. In the first place, as all occultists know, each person is constantly surrounded with what has been called an \"atmosphere\" composed of mental and emotional vibrations which are emanated from his personality. The atmosphere of each person depends upon the general character of the thoughts and feelings of the person in question. Consequently, as no two persons are precisely alike in character, it follows that no two personal atmospheres are exactly alike. Each person has a psychic atmosphere of his or her own. These atmospheric vibrations do not extend very far from the presence of the person, and consequently, affect only those coming near to him. In the same way, every group or crowd of persons has its own psychic atmosphere, composed of a blending of the individual psychic atmospheres of the persons composing the crowd, group or assemblage, and representing the general average of the thought and feelings of the crowd. There are no two group atmospheres exactly alike, for the reason that no two groups of persons, large or small, are exactly alike. Actors know that 199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"each audience which they face has its own psychic atmosphere, and the actors are affected by it. Preachers, lawyers, and public speakers, in general, are quite aware of this fact, and freely admit it, though they may not be acquainted with the causes or laws governing the phenomena. Following the same psychic law, every town or large city, or even every small village or section of a larger town, is found to have its own distinctive psychic atmosphere, which is very perceptible to strangers visiting, and which affect those who take up their residence there. In large cities, every building has its own vibrations which arise from the general character of those occupying it. Different church buildings, likewise, reflect the character of the general habits of thought and feeling of those worshiping in them. Likewise, certain business streets have pleasant or unpleasant vibrations in their atmosphere, from the same causes. Every person recognizes the truth of these statements, though but few are able to account for the facts in a scientific manner. The beginner in the study of psychic phenomena often asks how these things can be, when the thought which has occasioned the vibrations have long since passed away. The explanation is simple when properly explained. It is something like this: just as heat remains in a room after the stove has ceased to throw out heat-waves, so do the vibrations of thought and feeling persist long after the thought or feeling has died away. Or, if you prefer a more material illustration, we may say that if a package of perfumery has been opened in a room, and then removed, the air will remain charged with the odor for a long time afterwards. So you see, the same principle applies in the case of psychic vibrations. The person carries around with him the general atmosphere of his characteristic mental and emotional vibrations, as does the house, store, church, street, town, or city, etc., are permeated with the psychic vibrations of those who have frequented them. Nearly everyone realizes the different feeling that impresses him when he enters a strange house, apartment, store, or church. Each one has its own difference of psychic effect. And, so can each person create his or her psychic effect upon those coming in contact with him or her, or who comes into his or her presence or vicinity. The next question asked by the thoughtful new student is this: If persons are constantly sending forth psychic vibrations, and if such vibrations persist for some time, why are we not overwhelmed with the force of them; and why are they not all so mixed up as to lose all their effect? 200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"In the first place, though we are constantly affected more or less by the multitude of psychic vibrations beating upon us, still the greater part of them do not consciously impress us. For example, we have but to consider how few of the sounds or sights of a busy street are impressed upon our consciousness. We hear and see only a few of the things which attract our attention and interest. The rest are lost to us, although our eyes and ears receive them all. In the same way, we are impressed only by the stronger vibrations which reach us, and then only by those which we have attracted to ourselves, or which prove attractive to us by reason of our own likes and dislikes. In the second place, the effect of certain thought vibrations is neutralized by the effect of the vibrations of thoughts of an opposite character. Just as a mixture of black and white produces the neutral color of grey, so do two currents of opposing thought vibrations tend to resolve themselves into a neutral vibration which has little or no effect upon those coming in contact with them. You may think of numerous correspondences to this in the world of material things. For instance, a mixture of very hot and very cold water will produce a neutral lukewarm liquid, neither hot nor cold. In the same way, two things of opposing taste characteristics, when blended, will produce a neutral taste having but little effect upon one. The principle is universal and is readily understood. In the third place, there is that which we may call an “affinity” between thoughts and feelings of a similar character. Not only do the vibrations of similar thoughts tend to coalesce and combine; but, more than this, each one of us attracts to himself or herself the thought vibrations which are in general accord with corresponding thoughts in our own minds, or feelings in our own nature. Like attracts like. In the same way, the character of our thoughts and feelings act to repel thought or emotional vibrations of an opposite or inharmonious nature. As all occultists know, everyone draws thought vibrations in harmony with his or her own; and also repels thought vibrations of an inharmonious nature. These are the general laws and principles governing the phenomena of this phase of telepathic vibrations. There is much more to be said on the subject, of course, but if you will note carefully the leading principles and laws of manifestation just mentioned, you will be able to reason correctly regarding any phase of this class of phenomena which may come before you for attention. Once you learn a general rule, the rest becomes merely a matter of application and interpretation. 201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" Let us now proceed to a consideration of other phases of the general subject of telepathic influence. We now come to the phase of what may be called direct telepathy—that is where a thought is consciously, and more or less purposely, directed toward another person. We come across many interesting cases of this kind, where persons find themselves thinking intently of certain other persons, and afterwards are told by the other persons that “I found myself thinking intently about you, at such and such a time,” etc. In some of these cases, it is difficult to determine which one started the thinking. Again, how often do we find ourselves thinking of a person when all of a sudden the person comes into sight. Again, we think intently and earnestly about a certain question; and then, all of a sudden, other folks whom we meet begin talking to us about the same thing. These instances are too common to need more than a passing notice. A little more purpose is displayed in that class of phenomena in which we intently wish that a certain person shall do a certain thing, and lo and behold! we soon learn that that certain person has done it. A number of years ago, a popular writer wrote an article in which he mentioned what seemed to him to be a curious instance of some form of mental influence or telepathy. He said that he had found out that if he would sit down and carefully write a letter to the person who he had not heard from for a long time, and then destroy the letter instead of sending it, he would be almost certain to receive a letter from that person within a few days. He did not attempt to account for the phenomenon, he merely called the attention of his readers to it. Many persons have followed the suggestion, often with very wonderful results. There is nothing miraculous, or supernatural about such occurrences. It is merely one phase of telepathy. The concentrated thought of the writer of the letter is directed toward the other person, and that person begins to think of the first one; then he thinks he will write to him; then he actually does write. Distance, space, and direction have no importance in this experiment—it is not necessary to even know where the second person is, in fact. There are people who are so close to psychic harmony with each other, that they very often are able to ask questions and receive answers from each other, even though great distances separate them. At particular times there is a better psychic harmony existing between the same persons than is found at other times. All this, of course, affects the success of the experiment. It is surprising what wonderful 202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"results along these lines may be obtained by almost any person of average intelligence, after a little careful, patient, conscientious practice. There have also been phenomena obtained as the result of a long series of careful experiments which are, in a way, even more wonderful than these somewhat less deliberate experiments just mentioned. I allude to the experiments of a number of earnest, careful scientific students, who surrounded themselves with every precaution against over-enthusiasm, fraud, and coincidence. Prominent among this class of investigations we find those conducted by the Society for Psychical Research, in England, that has really established a firm basis for the work of other investigators, who followed the general methods of the said society. In the following chapter, I will present a somewhat extended statement of the results of such investigations, because this information is important to every student of psychic phenomena, not only because it establishes a firm scientific basis for studies and beliefs, but also because it supplies important information which he may apply in the course of his own experimental work. I would like to mention that the investigations into the subject of telepathy, and kindred subjects, under the auspices of the society just mentioned, were conducted by men of careful scientific training and experience, and under the general supervision and approval of the officers of the society, among them, being eminent men such as Prof. Henry Sidgwick, of Cambridge University; Prof. Balfour Stewart, a Fellow of the Royal Society of England; Rt. Hon. A.J. Balfour, the English statesman; Prof. William James, the American psychologist; Sir William Crookes, the great chemist and discoverer of physical laws, who invented the celebrated \"Crookes' Tubes,\" without which the discovery of X Rays, radioactivity, etc., would not have been possible; Frederick W.H. Myers, the celebrated explorer of the astral planes, and writer on psychic phenomena; Sir Oliver Lodge, the popular English scientist; and other men of international reputation and high standing. The character of these men lends the stamp of scientific accuracy to all the work of the society. In order that you may understand the spirit which animated these scientific investigators in their work for the exploration of this new and strange region of Nature, I ask you to carefully read the following words of the presidential address of Sir William Crookes, before the Royal Society, in Bristol, England, in 1898. Please remember, that this speech was made 203"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"before an assemblage of distinguished scientists, many of them being materialists and, quite skeptical of all occult phenomena—this was nearly twenty years ago, that Sir William Crookes stated: Were I now introducing for the first time these inquiries to the world of science, I should choose a starting point different from that of old (where we formerly began). It would be well to begin with Telepathy; with that fundamental law, as I believe it to be, that thoughts and images may be transferred from one mind to another without the agency of the recognized organs of sense—that knowledge may enter the human mind without being communicated in any hitherto known or recognized ways. If telepathy takes place, we have two physical facts—the physical change in the brain of A, the suggestor, and the analogous physical change in the brain of B, the recipient of the suggestion. Between these two physical events there must exist a train of physical causes and is unscientific to call in the aid of mysterious agencies, when with every fresh advance in knowledge it is shown that either vibration have powers and attributes abundantly able to any demand—even the transmission of thought. It is supposed by some physiologists that the essential cells of nerves do not actually touch, but are separated by a narrow gap which widens in sleep while it narrows almost to extinction during mental activity. This condition is so singularly like a Branly or Lodge coherer (a device which led to the discovery of wireless telegraphy) as to suggest a further analogy. The structure of brain and nerve being similar, it is conceivable that there may be present masses of such nerve coherers in the brain, whose special function it may be to receive impulses brought from without, through the connecting sequence of ether waves of the appropriate order of magnitude. Roentgen has familiarized us with an order of vibrations of extreme minuteness as compared with the smallest waves with which we have hitherto been acquainted: and there is no reason to suppose that we have here reached the limit of frequency. It is known that the action of thought is accompanied by certain molecular movements in the brain, and here we have physical vibrations capable from their extreme minuteness of acting directly upon individual molecules, while their rapidity approaches that of internal and external movements of the atoms themselves. A formidable range of phenomena must be scientifically sifted before we effectually grasp a faculty so strange, so bewildering, and for ages so inscrutable, as the direct action of mind upon mind. In the old Egyptian days, a well-known inscription was carved over the portal of the Temple of 204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Isis: I am whatever has been, is, or ever will be; and my veil no man hath yet lifted. Not thus do modern seekers after truth confronts Nature—the word that stands for the baffling mysteries of the Universe. Steadily, unflinchingly, we strive to pierce the inmost heart of Nature, from what she is to reconstruct what she has been and to prophesy what she shall be. Veil after veil we have lifted, and her face grows more beautiful, august and wonderful, with every barrier that is withdrawn. FIG 20 – Sir William Crookes (1832 –1919). You will notice that this address made many years ago, and from the standpoint of physical science, is in full accord with the ideas of occultism, that is as old as the hills. And yet, the speaker worked the idea out independently. He also investigated higher forms of psychic phenomena, with results that startled the world. But, you will notice that he does not attempt to give any other than purely physical laws, the credit for the ordinary phenomena of telepathy. And he was thoroughly right in this, as we have seen. He escaped the common error of confusing physical-sense phenomena with the phenomena of the astral-senses. Each plane has its own phenomena—and each class is surely wonderful enough. And, again, remember that both physical and astral phenomena are purely natural; there is no need for seeking any supernatural agencies to account for these natural facts. [47] Man, A Transformer of Energy 205"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"As a microcosm or little universe, man is able to transmit and receive a very wide variety of energies. In addition to the energy derived from the food he eats and the air he breathes, he is also the medium for countless other forces. His astral body constantly receives and transmits the energy radiated by the planets. Even as the sun acts as a transformer for the high- frequency energies of space, so man in his turn acts as a transformer of planetary energies. He is also a transmitter of intellectual and spiritual energies that reach him as wave motions from regions of greater intelligence and spirituality. The grade of intellectual and spiritual force he transmits depends upon his mental development and soul unfoldment. The astral energies radiated by the planets are intercepted by his astral body being received more freely at those points in his astral structure, as indicated by planets in his birth-chart, that were organized by states of consciousness previous to his birth. These astral energies are even more essential to the welfare of the astral body, than is sunlight to the welfare of the physical body. Only a portion of such energies received, however, is utilized by the person. The balance undergoes transformation, or change in frequency of vibration, and is again radiated, much as the sun and planets receive energy of a more general character, and radiate it again. Likewise, such spiritual and intellectual energy as man receives or generates is again, in large measure, radiated. As seen by clairvoyant vision this radiation is of two distinct and separate qualities. The grosser astral energies and thought vibrations flow forth to remain in contact with the earth and may be received in measure by lower life forms. In other words, the thoughts and feelings of man, as well as certain other astral energies, flow about and permeate the earth, so that other life forms coming in contact with them may receive and appropriate as their organization will permit. In the upward struggle of the seven sub-mundane degrees of life, this force radiated by man and penetrating to the very center of the earth is of great assistance. It affords these degrees of life from mineral to man whatever intellectual energies they are capable of absorbing and utilizing. It thus hastens their evolution through providing them with mental nutriment and the incentive to effort. The other and more spiritual portion of the force radiated by man travels away from the earth to the astral plane immediately surrounding it. There are seven super-mundane realms of life; realms of life whose denizens have never been, and never will be, incarnated on earth. They 206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"form a gradation in spirituality of seven steps between man and the angel. Being too spiritual and lacking in penetrative and initiative force for incarnation in gross matter, they depend upon man for all knowledge of material conditions. The higher essences of man’s intellectual and spiritual endeavors may be assimilated by them and give them information that is a requisite of their progress. But now I must return to earth, and to matters that are susceptible of proof by the average man. A very common phenomenon, and one that should be understood by everyone, so that one can avoid becoming the dupes of unscrupulous practical psychologists, is the exercise of thought power to influence another person’s thoughts and actions without the intervention of the spoken word, or any sign. It is possible, for instance, in a public gathering, to concentrate the mind on a person and make him turn and look. If the person is known to the experimenter, it will be much easier to influence him, for a point of contact will previously have been established. But it is also possible to influence a total stranger. These experiments which have been rigidly tested, and after coincidence, have been eliminated, found to produce the desired effect, are very simple, but they demonstrate in a very forcible and convenient way, that the mind of one person can, and sometimes does, influence another person at a distance. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for a hypnotist to direct the actions of his subject by mental command alone. There is plenty of irrefutable evidence that this has been successfully done. The various kinds of absent treatments applied by metaphysicians, mental scientists, Christian scientists, and new thought practitioners, are practical applications of this power of one person to influence another at a distance. The thought of one individual sets up lines of force in an astral substance which reach the second individual, and if the experiment is successful, sets up vibrations similar to the thought held, in the unconscious mind or astral body of the other individual. If the person to whom the thought is sent is one who is in the habit of controlling his own thoughts and actions, his unconscious mind will repel, and will not accept the thought sent to it, unless it is a thought quite acceptable and perceived to be for his welfare. But if the person has cultivated irresponsible mediumship, or is naturally negative, the thought will enter the unconscious mind and may quite dominate it. The thoughts and actions then will be those willed by the 207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"person sending the thought. No person who habitually controls his own thoughts and actions need be dominated by any other person or entity. The soul that has built the body about itself, under normal circumstances, is quite able to resist foreign invasion from any source. It is aware that to turn around and look at someone who is concentrating on him in a public meeting is not apt to prove detrimental, but it will resist detrimental mental commands even as he would resist them if they were uttered aloud. Once a thought image has been accepted, however, particularly if the image is strong and vivid, momentous results may follow. The physical body is shaped and molded by the astral body. Normally this molding is quite gradual, but when the image in the unconscious mind is supported by an unusual amount of energy it brings about such a radical and abrupt change in the astral form, that the physical also is drastically transformed. In proof of this, it would be an easy matter to cite numerous instances in which persons have been instantly healed by mental or spiritual treatment, such healing being accompanied by marked changes in the body and its functions. Almost everyone nowadays knows of one or more such cases. [48]  Reincarnation and more on the Illuminati In the year 553 A. D., the doctrine of reincarnation was officially banished by the Christian Church. Officially it was banished for no other reason than it was considered to be too much of an influence from the Orient, but in reality, it hides the biggest secret belief of the Illuminati elite. The decision was intended to enable the church to increase its power at that time and to tighten its hold upon the human mind by telling people their 208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"salvation had to be accomplished in one incarnation and one lifetime, and if they didn't make it, they would go to Hell. The human mind today is beginning to unfold in such a way that this simplistic viewpoint no longer makes sense to many people. Still, there are many who depend on this idea for their devotional support, and for a feeling of comfort that was constructed by the elite to manipulate and control the masses. So Christians feel that in order to fulfill this commandment of salvation, they must accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour when in reality Christianity has been transformed by the Illuminated elite into a tool for their power. However, one thing we need to understand is what happens when we go through the experience of having the life force leave our bodies. As we go with that life force, our consciousness begins to identify with the soul. It continues to be aware, identifying with the content of our experiences accumulated from many incarnations past. Once we can consciously do that, we will then have some understanding of what the next incarnation will be, even before it happens, and the elite knows that very well and use it to their own advantage. Even at the present time, we can all understand what the next incarnation will be if we use the powers of reason, imagination and mind to analyze what's going on now in the Hic et Nunc . If things don't change within us, and if we continue to let the things that are now happening go on within us, and around us, without trying to understand and do something about it, then our suffering and stupidity, plus our ignorance, will continue into the next incarnation, just as the problems of one day tend to go into the next, unless there are changes made. The laws of reincarnation have to do with the kind of existence we will have thousands of years into the future. If we could understand the meaning and the secrets of reincarnation, like the Illuminati, we would be able to go back thousands of years into the past. We would be able to understand how we accumulated, as individuals and as groups, the ideas and the feelings which are now in our consciousness, seeking to express themselves. Just because we do not have historical evidence of civilizations that lived more than 6,000 years ago, does not mean these great civilizations did not exist. The earth changes. Physical evidence is covered up and destroyed down through thousands of years of time. Therefore, the place we must look for evidence of the past is in our own consciousness, and not in physical things. The things of our consciousness are never destroyed. Ideas, inspirations, the great creative ideas of the present and the future, have been lying dormant in the human consciousness for many, many thousands of years. 209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"It is important for us to understand that these ideas are present in the minds of certain persons belonging to the good side of the Illuminati who know how to express them for the benefit of the human race. This is really where the idea of reincarnation comes in wonderfully, and it is important for us to realize that the ideas themselves are for the benefit of the human race and not an exclusivity of the elite or their occult circles. [49] The belief in reincarnation―the Transmigration of the Soul―forms the basis of the earliest beliefs of the various Illuminati Mystery Schools and the ancient schools of philosophy. The Greek philosopher Pherecydes taught it, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato, Virgil, and Ovid embraced it in their philosophies. Plato, for example, wrote: “By making the right use of those things remembered from the former life, by constantly perfecting himself in the mysteries, a man becomes truly perfect.” The belief in reincarnation is also found in Jewish literature, in the Talmud, in the writings of Philo, and it is definitely proclaimed in the Kabbalah, the system of Jewish theosophy that even permeated the Christian faith in the middle ages, and is considered central to the Illuminati belief system. It was, for this reason, accepted by Giordano Bruno, and treated with respect, if not with full acceptance, by Illuminati member Goethe and also by Kent, Lessing, Hume, Schopenhauer and many others of the western school of science and philosophy. It reaches from the Wisdom of the Chaldeans to the Yogis of India, from the Magi of Persia to the Philosophers of the East. “The soul is not born; it does not die; it was not produced by anyone; nor, was any produced from it,” declared Emerson. “There is not, in my opinion, wrote Addison, a more pleasing consideration than that of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength, to consider that it is to shine forever with new accessions of glory and brighten to all eternity; that it will be still adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge, carries in it something wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man.” “Nature , writes Schlegel, is nothing less than the ladder of resurrection which, step by step, leads upward―or rather is carried from the abyss of eternal death up to the apex of life.” Benjamin Disraeli, known British politician, and writer who twice served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said: “There is no system so simple, and so little repugnant to our understanding, as that of 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"metempsychosis. The pains and pleasures of this life are by this system considered as the recompense or the punishment of our actions in another state.” Among the many arguments advanced to sustain the claims of reincarnation, the following may be cited: The theory of immortality demands it; analogy makes it most probable; science, in many ways, confirms it, especially in the law of evolution; it explains many otherwise mysterious experiences in life; and, it alone solves the problem of apparent injustice and misery in the world.  In his poem on the philosopher Pythagoras, translated by Dryden, Ovid wrote: “ Death, so-called, is but old matter dressedin some new form; and in a varied vestfrom tenement to tenement though tossed, The soul is still the same, the figure only lost and, as the softened wax new seals receive, This face assumes, and that impression leaves, Now called by one, now by another name; The form is only changed; the wax is still the same. Then, to be born is to begin to beSome other thing we were not formerly.That forms are changed, I grant; that nothing can Continue in the figure it began.” So we have seen in the previous words, that reincarnation was among the secret teachings in all of the temples of antiquity connected to the Illuminati network. Presented originally as a part of the initiation into the great mysteries of ancient Egypt, this revelation has now passed on to all mystical religions, who basically gave birth to the various Illuminati sects. Gérard Anaclet Vincent Encausse (1865 – 1916) a figure I often cite and describe in my past publications, whose esoteric pseudonym was Papus, wrote: We find it repeatedly among the classic authors, of whom we have given numerous examples, and we find it repeatedly in Buddhism. The relatively modern study of writings from India has altered ideas about the fabulous antiquity of the Indian alphabet. The works of Philippe Berger and other sages, who only go back to about 500 years before Jesus Christ, that being the time of the Buddha. According to the Academy of Grammarians the Sanskrit alphabet, that is to say, the alphabet of Thebah was in use during the time of Gautama the Buddha, a Brahman initiate who left his father’s palace — the center of initiation — to offer part of the mysteries to the profane world. We should not imagine, however, that the Buddhist religion is the creator of this idea of reincarnation. Rather Buddha, at a considerable sacrifice in service to humanity, was the one to reveal this to the common people. People interested in these matters will find in a 211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"volume by M.de Lafont titled Buddhism, precise texts and teachings, which will satisfy their interest fully. Has reincarnation been a part of the Christian religion at some time? One can frankly respond in the affirmative to this. Significantly the gospels tell us in plain language that Saint John the Baptist was the reincarnated Elias. This was a mystery and Saint John the Baptist, when questioned, kept quiet but others knew the truth of it.The parable of a man blind from birth is another example. The suggestion that he was being punished for previous sins presents an interesting matter for reflection. The Christian religion is a direct continuation of the Egyptian, and each one of the evangelists is represented by a symbol that is one in the four of the Sphinx: the human head, or the angel, an eagle, a lion and a bull. The idea of reincarnation was contained in the secret teachings of the Church, as were many of the initiatory concepts of Egypt. It has been said that the Church condemned reincarnation; this is false. A council has said though, that those believed to have returned to earth were not accepted into heaven; but far from condemning reincarnation, this warning of the Council indicates the contrary. It was also part of the teachings that if someone returned voluntarily through reincarnation, not because heaven was displeased with him or her, but for love of their neighbor, the curse would not apply to them (Rozier). Lastly, according to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, who have kept much less of the occult tradition than the Russian orthodox church, a considerable span of time lapses between the judgment at the end of life and the final judgment. It is at that final judgment, according to Catholicism, that the soul is assigned its final destination. Until this moment the spirit can change, during this time between the two trials. And how does the spirit function during this time lapse between the two trials? You can appreciate that heaven, hell and purgatory are experiential states that can be lived in material form . As Papus continue in his profound explanation of this delicate subject he also writes: This is what Swedenborg taught as well as Mohammed, even though he had an aversion to all forms of traditional esotericism. Yet he indicates that he was aware of these things when saying in his chapter, The women of the Koran, that Christ would return at the end of time to judge between the living and the dead . It is certain that the idea of reincarnation that 212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"was an illuminating lighthouse in antiquity. For the Illuminati, this idea has not been lost and was transmitted by them in various ways, in all religions. In modern times this idea has reappeared, and Papus reminds us that it is mainly supported by three traditions: 1)The cabalist tradition brought out of Egypt and passed along to us by the Pythagoreans and the Neoplatonists; 2)the Asian tradition passed along to us by the Buddhists of which I have just spoken, and lastly 3) the modern revival of Spiritualism . Translator and author Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail , well-known by the alias of Allan Kardec , has rendered western humanity a great service by popularizing the dogma of reincarnation. If this idea troubles certain weak minds consider at other times, say around the year 100, the impact of the idea of hell. The idea prevented so many suicides and gave so much hope, that it would be appropriate to congratulate the creator of contemporary spiritism, as well as its successors, such as Gabriel Delanne, León Denís and Leymarie, who spread among the masses such a beautiful instrument of hope. Child prodigies are easily explained by the idea of reincarnation, as are the experiences of people who find a curious familiarity in certain places and lands. Without becoming dogmatic, we can appreciate the clarity that the doctrine of reincarnation provides in understanding a number of personal and social issues. It is not our intention here to present an extensive historical or bibliographical exploration. My main purpose, as well as the point of distinguished esoterists like Papus, is unveiling the secrets of the various Illuminati Mystery School traditions, to awaken the sleeping God within our readers, creating the inner enthusiasm that reveal the true mysteries to them If you move in this direction you can begin to understand the true earthly economy, that the social order is merely a tool and not an end purpose. Papus is also clear on this specific point: Our higher abilities deserve to be devoted to finer things than the earthly ideals of acquiring material wealth and gratification of one’s pride. To follow Christ it is necessary to abandon everything without regret, as one abandons an old garment in order to clothe themselves in garments of an initiate’s light. To understand earthly life as something more than a comedy in which we play our particular part as characters during our brief existence, it is necessary to partake of the mysteries of the Father. It is 213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"necessary to willingly sacrifice all that is not eternal. When we know the mysteries of reincarnation we are able to join Saint Paul in saying, Oh death, where is thy terror? Oh grave, where thy sting? Doctor Rozier, in fact, says: I wish only to prove that the Catholics are entitled to believe what seems most rational to them in this manner: the generally held opinion among them is that one lives only once on the earth, but no real prohibition exists to believing otherwise. An opinion, that is what it is for those who hold it, is always subject to revision. Certainly, if we are enamored by a theory that contradicts what is held by men of considerable learning and honor, the Fathers of the Church, for example, we should be restrained from demanding arguments of substance, if we continue to profess this, but we should not surrender to these arguments by virtue of their considerable force without looking at the matter and considering it from both sides. The old Christian reincarnationists did not propose that mortal life on earth is the result of a diminishing of God’s grace, or one’s losing their love of God, but quite to the contrary, that earthly life is imposed to evolve us and make us the masters of the material world to which, by the fall of Adam, we became slaves. This earthly existence would not mature without difficulties, if it were prolonged beyond a hundred years, for reasons that it is pointless to address here, but a hundred years is insufficient to obtain a definitive victory. It has therefore been necessary to grant us a longer span of time, and that segment by intervals similar to the intervals between the dreams of deep sleep and daydreams. Each type of dream may be called a death. Certainly, each existence is accompanied by forgetfulness of those that have preceded it, but this forgetfulness is providential. It facilitates evolution because with complete memory it would be difficult to change, on this plane of existence. When we have finally awakened a sufficient number of times to achieve the purpose of our efforts, the sanctification, we die one final time and return no more. It is then that we are judged finally and relegated to our place in heaven or purgatory. If, on the contrary, in each existence, we descend lower and lower until we reach a point at which no hope of salvation exists any longer, we will die one last time and go to hell, but this is a most unusual occurrence. Considered this way the theory of reincarnation, as presented by the old Christian reincarnationists, can be accepted or rejected by the Catholics, but does not fall under the curse, as previously mentioned. [50] Gareth Knight wrote a small essay on Papus on reincarnation, that might be worth citing, as he gives us an even more clear understanding of it: 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"In the first of his weighty occult books – Elementary Treatise on Occult Science (Traité Élémentaire de Science Occulte) of 1888 – Papus makes little mention of Reincarnation. In fact, by just one word as a passing reference in a single paragraph. And it was not until 1912 that he got round to a book devoted entirely to the subject, La Réincarnation. His initial reluctance may have been influenced by Eliphas Levi, who in his History of Magic, apart from a brief mention of Pythagoras, was also short on the “where the heart is”, like Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) first said. After a period of more or less long sleep without suffering, since there is no longer terrestrial matter, what another famous Illuminati, the count of Count Cagliostro, called the immortal Spirit, awakes and begins a new existence . It attaches at first to those it has left on Earth and may seek to communicate with them by a dream or some intermediary that might be found. However, let me be clear on this point, we should not force communication between different planes like Alan Kardec suggested in his Spiritism because these practices are always delicate and could present certain dangers. So like esoteric student Gareth Knight explains, we risk being tricked by the brain of the “medium” who, unconsciously repeats ideas dear to the consultant, by temporary images, animated photographs floating in the astral, or via beings who serve themselves or the medium to seize a little material existence. It is thus wise to wait for news from the traveler. It needs calm to obtain the certainty of their effective existence over there, and then think much of the traveler, with the magnet of love and not of despair and tears, and then, very gently, the veil will lift, a sweet murmur fill the heart, the presence of the beyond appears, and little by little a great mystery is revealed. So much for Papus’ take on psychic communication with the departed, but what about those who have passed on further, to possible reincarnation in a different body or personality? Here, as Gareth Knight points out, Papus launches into a technical analysis based upon ancient Egyptian religious practices where we find of course, the roots of Illuminati practices and traditions. In his essay on the Swedish scientist, philosopher and Illuminati, Emanuel Swedenborg Emerson writes : In common parlance, what one man is said to learn by experience, a man of extraordinary sagacity is said, without experience, to divine. The Arabians say that Abdul Khain, the mystic, and Abu Ali Scena, the philosopher, conferred together; and on parting the philosopher said, “All 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"that he sees, I know”; and the mystic said, “All that he knows, I see.” Adding: If one should ask the reason of this intuition, the solution would lead us into that property which Plato denoted as reminiscence, and which is implied by the Brahmans in the tenet of transmigration...For all things in Nature being linked and related, and the soul having heretofore known all, nothing hinders but that any man who has recalled to mind, or, according to the common phrase, has learned one thing only, should of himself recover all his ancient knowledge and find out again all the rest, if he have but courage, and faint not in the midst of his researches.

He is best known for his 216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell (1758). Illuminated Visionaries: From Swedenborg to Edgar Cayce There is no doubt that Swedenborg anticipated many scientific facts and positions that are usually regarded as being more modern. It was only toward the end of the 19th century, that his voluminous writings began to be properly collected and examined, which proved that there was hardly one department of scientific activity in which he was not far ahead of his time. His work on palaeontology shows him to be the predecessor of all the Scandinavian geologists, and his contributions in this field alone would have been sufficient to perpetuate his fame. He was also a great physicist and had arrived at the nebular hypothesis theory of the formation of the planets and the sun long before Kant and Laplace. Swedenborg’s theory of light and theory of the cosmic atoms were equally astonishing. He wrote a lucid account of the phenomena of phosphorescence, and adduced a molecular magnetic theory, which anticipated some of the chief features of the hypothesis of today. The great French chemist, Dumas, gives Swedenborg the credit for the first attempt to establish a system of crystallography. He was the first to employ mercury for the air pump and devised a method of determining longitude at sea by observations of the moon among the stars. He suggested the use of experimental tanks for testing the powers of ship models, invented an ear- trumpet for the deaf, improved the common house stove of his native land, cured smoky chimneys, took a lively interest in machine-guns and even sketched a flying machine. In no field was Swedenborg's research more noteworthy than in those of physiological science. It is clear that Swedenborg showed, 150 years before any other scientist, that the motion of the brain was synchronous with respiration and not with the action of the heart and the circulation of the blood, a discovery the full bearings of which are still far from being realized. He had arrived at the modern conception of the activity of the brain as the combined activity of its individual cells. The cerebral cortex, and, more definitely the cortical elements (nerve cells), formed the seat of the activity of the soul and were ordered into departments according to various functions. His views as to the physiological functions of the spinal cord are also in agreement with 217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"recent research, and he anticipated many of the pre-eminent roles of the ductless glands, which students of the present time are only beginning to discover. Up to middle age, Swedenborg's position was that of a scholar, a scientist. But a profound change was coming over him, which led him to leave the domain of physical research for that of psychical and spiritual inquiry. Neither by geometrical, nor physical, nor metaphysical principles had he succeeded in reaching and grasping the infinite and the spiritual, or in elucidating their relation to man and man's organism, though he had caught glimpses of facts and methods which he thought only required confirmation and development.Late in life, he wrote to Oetinger that “he was introduced by the Lord first into the natural sciences, and thus prepared, and, indeed, from the year 1710 to 1745, when heaven was opened to him.” The latter event is described by him as “his introduction into the spiritual world.” Before his illumination, he had been instructed by dreams, and enjoyed extraordinary visions, and heard mysterious conversations. The life of religion , Swedenborg said, is to do good. The kingdom of Heaven is a kingdom of uses. The attention of modern psychologists is now being drawn to his doctrine of the relation of the elements of the universe to the membranes of the body. Into this world at times come colossal characters like Swedenborg who stand like mile-posts in the long journey of human life. From where did they come? Heredity does not account for them because their ancestry does not disclose it. In his writings, Swedenborg gives detailed descriptions of the afterlife— including heaven, hell, and the world of spirits in between—and the stages of development that a person’s mind and soul experience during life on earth and in the spiritual realms after death. He describes a linear process of spiritual growth in which people are born, live on earth, and then continue living and growing eternally in the afterlife. None of this suggests that Swedenborg would be sympathetic to the idea of living multiple lifetimes on earth. And in fact, in one of his rare explicit references to reincarnation, he depicts a philosopher in the afterlife first arguing in favor of reincarnation and then, having been enlightened by the Lord, disavowing the notion as insane. Swedenborg goes even farther, comparing a particular belief about Jesus to the absurd notion that someone’s soul can cross over into someone else’s. [51] However, their posterity, even greater than themselves as in the case of the same Swedenborg, demonstrates it. What other solution may there be, except that these people have lived other lives, have gained their 218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"greatness through former experience s? Most of us, if not all of us, have had many strange experiences that only the theory of reincarnation can answer. Dreams of forgotten scenes, flashes of buried memories come at times, like voices from a dim and curtained past. It was such experiences that led Sir Walter Scott to a sense of metempsychosis. From his diary, February 17, 1828, his biographer, Lockhart, in his book, Life of Scott, records: I cannot, I am sure, tell if it is worth marking down, that yesterday, at dinner time, I was strangely haunted by what I would call the sense of pre- existence, a confused idea that nothing that passed was said for the first time; that the same topics had been discussed and the persons had stated the same opinions on them...The sensation was so strong as to resemble what is called a mirage in the desert and a calenture on board ship. The poet Poe writes in Eureka : We walk about, amid the destinies of our worldly existence, accompanied by dim but ever present memories of a destiny more vast―very distant in the bygone time...We live out a youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams, yet never mistaking them for dreams. As memories, we know them. During our youth, the distinctiveness is too clear to deceive us even for a moment. But the doubt of manhood dispels these feelings as illusions. The origin of the Jewish Kabbalah is not known. While doubtless parts have been later added to it, Jewish scholars place its origin in remote antiquity. In the Zohar, or Book of Light , contained in the Kabbalah, are found these words: All the souls are subject to the trials of transmigration, and men do not know which are the ways of the Most High in their regard. They do not know how many transformations and mysterious trials they must undergo . That the doctrine of reincarnation, as taught in the Kabbalah, found acceptance among some of the Bible writers, as evidenced by numerous texts. In the Book of Proverbs —the actual authorship of which is unknown—we find these classic lines: The Lord possessed meat the beginning of his way,before the works of old.I was set up from everlasting,or ever the earth was.When there were no depths,I was brought forth;when there were no foundations abounding with water.Before the mountains were settled,before the hills was I brought forth;while as yet he had not made the earth,nor the fields, nor the highest partof the dust of the world.When he prepared the heavensI was there;When he set a compassupon the 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"face of the depth;when he established the clouds above;when he strengthenedthe foundations of the deep;when he gave to the sea his decree,that the waters should not pass his Commandment; when he appointed the foundation of the earth— then I was by him as one brought up with him;and I was daily his delight,rejoicing always before him; and my delights were with the sons of man . ―Proverbs 8: 22-31Jeremiah hears the voice of the Eternal ―“Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee.” ―Jeremiah 1: 5 These passages, as well as other similar ones in the Bible, disclose the belief of the Illuminati in the doctrine of reincarnation. And I want to add this belief remains central to the Illuminati network to this day. So to study the essence of this seemingly strange belief is to understand the modality and the secret traditions that bring time after time, certain families and certain bloodlines to generate the key protagonist in history and their special role in the play of the gods. To unveil, and possibly understand, the secrets of reincarnation in the various Illuminati sects, is ultimately to understand the secret key of their true power and wealth through the ages . Charles Johnston wrote: There are today, as there have always been, many who remember. One need only ask to find men and women who have a clear and definite vision of things that befell them in other lives. In offering reincarnation as the school of experience—a philosophy that solves the problem of life—E. D. Walker, in Reincarnation: A Study of Forgotten Truth , (London, 1888) writes: The broadest intelligence leads us directly into the evolutionary aspect of reincarnation...In this view, the present life is one grade of a stupendous school, in which we are being educated for a destiny so far beyond our comprehension that some call it a kind of deity. Even though we have descended below former altitudes, the only path to the absolute lies through the sensuous earthly vale. Sin itself, after we have escaped it, will lead to a mightier result than would be possible without it, or it would not be permitted. He also writes : The richest trees of all the forest spring from the unclean miasmic fens...We penetrate the animal existence in human form more 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"successfully than would be possible if we transmigrated into all the species of zoology; for here we carry sufficient intelligence, along with the material condition, to comprehend these creatures around us which cannot understand themselves. . . .The highest individuals of mankind, the true prophets and poets, attain this intimate communion with Nature, this mastery over the lower creation, which demonstrates their fitness for an introduction to a higher (creation). With all of the above stated, for the Christians of today, John the Baptist is probably the only possible case of a valid reincarnation. The only other possible candidate for a future reincarnation could be Enoch, who was also taken up in a chariot of fire, and never saw physical death. (Then again, some say that Elijah was Enoch as well...) As for Jesus, he won’t reincarnate in the end times, because he already died once, and also because of what Acts 1:9-11 states: Acts 1:9-11 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. Reincarnation involves being physically born more than once – into a new physical body. When Jesus returns to this world for the majority of Christians it won’t be through rebirth, but through a divine decent. Not to confuse the issue, but for some Illuminati orders there does exist the possibility that the mysterious character Melchizedek , found in Genesis 14:18, and Hebrews 7:2, could have been the pre-incarnate Christ. But judging by Melchizedek’s description in Hebrews 7:2, He isn’t really one that can be considered as re-incarnated, because He was apparently never born. If he was the pre-incarnate Christ, he simply assumed the physical properties of a human, without the birth process. [52] However, according to Edgar Cayce, considered one of the early prophets of the New Age, called by some “The American Prophet”, Jesus and Adam were different incarnations of the same Christ soul. Eve and the Virgin Mary (Jesus' twin soul) were also different incarnations of the same soul. This karmic connection between Adam and Jesus explains why Jesus was 221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"able to pay the \"karmic debt\" by atoning for the \"sin of Adam.\" This Adam-Jesus connection can be seen in the following excerpt from the Cayce readings: Question: \"When did the knowledge come to Jesus that he was to be the Savior of the world?\" Cayce: \"When he fell in Eden.\" According to Edgar Cayce some of the gurus, and many other personalities from the Old Testament and history, were also incarnations of Jesus. The Cayce material describes the entire Christian Bible as part of the story of Jesus' long struggle to attain \"Christhood\" and provides humanity a pattern to do the same. Cayce, “The American Prophet” was not a Freemason, but he still was regarded as a central figure by the Illluminati Network of his time, and he did make mention of the Masonic order in his voluminous works. The paperback book Edgar Cayce on Prophecy , published in 1967 by Carter, is a short compilation on the probable realities available to Cayce through the Akashic records. Chapter 7, Destiny of Nations, opens as follows : The peace of the world will be shaped by the American ideals and those of the masonic order! \" Not that the world is to become a Masonic Order,\" Cayce explained, but that the ideals will prevail . It goes on to state that these were from 29 readings between '21 and '44. In another reading that \"God is not a respecter of persons\" and further in 1938 \"Each Nation, each people have builded-by the very spirit of the people themselves- a purposeful position in the skein, the affairs, not only of the earth but of the universe!\" So what we can gather from the channeled material is that the intentions of the individual, and collectively the nation, rebound into the universe and that a kind of collective karma marks the nation’s identity. Freemasonry no doubt had a large influence at the founding of America, and as we articulate that all men are equal and meet on the level, and that the Creator drops a plumb line true and unbiased in judgment, and that we travel upon a level of time from whence none have returned, it is good to know that the apron of freemasonry remains suitably unstained at the level of the Akashic record. [53] In the 1930s and early 1940s, Cayce received a series of visions supposedly about the origins of ancient Egypt and the reasons the Giza pyramids and Sphinx were built, and their link to Atlantis: A record of Atlantis from the beginning of those periods when the Spirit 222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"took form, or began the encasements in that land; and the developments of the peoples throughout their sojourn; together with the record of the first destruction, and the changes that took place in the land; with the record of the sojournings of the peoples and their varied activities in other lands, and a record of the meetings of all the nations or lands, for the activities in the destruction of Atlantis; and the building of the pyramid of initiation, together with whom, what, and where the opening of the records would come, that are as copies from the sunken Atlantis. For with the change, it [Atlantis] must rise again. In position, this lies — as the sun rises from the waters — as the line of the shadows (or light) falls between the paws of the Sphinx; that was set later as the sentinel or guard and which may not be entered from the connecting chambers from the Sphinx’s right paw until the time has been fulfilled when the changes must be active in this sphere of man’s experience.

There were fewer people,and we lived closer to the land.People knew the language of the rain, the crops, and the Great Creator. They even knew how to speak to the stars and the sky people. They were aware that life is sacred and comes from the marriage between Mother Earth and Father Sky. In this time, there was balance and people were happy. Then something happened. No one really knows why, but people started to forget who they were. In their forgetting, they began to feel separate - separate from the earth, from each other, and even from the one who created them. They were lost and wandered through life with no direction or connection. In their separation, they believed that they had to fight to survive in this world and defend themselves against the same forces that gave them the life they had learned to live in harmony with and trust. Soon all of their energy was used to protect themselves from the world around them, instead of making peace with the world within them. Even though they had forgotten who they were, somewhere inside of them the gift of their ancestors remained. There was still a memory that lived within them. In their dreams at night, they knew that they held the power to heal their bodies, bring rain when they needed to, and speak with their ancestors. They knew that somehow they could find their place in the natural world once again. As they tried to remember who they were, they began to build the things outside of their bodies that reminded them of who they were on the inside. As time went on, they even built machines to do their healing, made chemicals to grow their crops, and stretched wires to communicate over long distances. The farther away they wandered from their inner power, the more cluttered their outer lives became with the things that they believed would make them happy. No one knows how the story ends because it isn't finished. The people who got lost are our ancestors, and we 225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"are the ones who are writing the ending. There is a great lesson to learn from the legendary Atlantis to prevent the same ending for our current Civilization. Erudite, Freemason and influential Illuminati, John Yarker who wa s Sovereign Grand Conservator of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Masonry, whom conferred in this capacity upon Madame Blavatsky a Masonic diploma, had a lot to say about this “very different world” when he explained in his Arcane Schools that th e Aryan legend of the sunken Atlantis is said to have been recorded in Egypt. Yaker, reminds us, in fact, that: “Plato indirectly informed us in the Timaeus that when his ancestor Solon once visited Egypt the priests of Neith at Sais informed him that many catastrophes had occurred to mankind in remote times, the most remarkable of which was one contained in the records of the temple. Some 9,000 years before his visit, which took place about 600 B.C., a large continent, and some adjacent islands had perished in one night by earthquakes, and that from these islands was the way to the true continent; that the inhabitants of this Atlantis were a race who recognized that great advantages sprang from a just and righteous commerce; that they had conquered and colonised Greece, and extended themselves on one side as far as Lybia, and on the other to Tyrrhenia. But a part of the island’s inhabitants had given themselves up to selfish aggrandizement and had made war upon the well-disposed people, and to subvert the good regulations which had been established by Poseidon and his son Atlas. Whereupon the incensed gods, in one night, sank the country of Atlantis beneath the waves of the ocean. It is further stated that the country had temples of black and white stones, decorated within and without with precious metals. The shrine of Poseidon and the palace of the King was surrounded with three sheets of water, forming three parallel concentric circles, and a temple existed roofed with gilded copper. Theopompus in his Meropis attributes a similar account to the priests of Phrygia, and tells us that the island contained a fighting and a contemplative race; the former knew how to make themselves invulnerable to iron so that they could only be wounded by stone or wood. Proclus quotes Marcellus on the subject. Madame Blavatsky says that they had a written character and used it with the tanned skins of monstrous animals now extinct. Professor Bowdler Sharpe thought that allied forms of birds point to a lost continent which stretched from South America to Australia with an arm extending to Madagascar, and this would meet the account of Plato. We have another account, similar in its essentials to that recorded. The Popul-Vul , or Book of the Azure Veil of the Mexicans, tells us that these Atlantians were a race that knew all things by intuition , and repeat 226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"the charge of sorcery, or black magic, as the cause of the destruction of their country by the gods .” Contemporary researcher Eric Dubay writes that the Toltecs, Nahuatlacas, and Aztecs of South America and all the races that settled Mexico traced their ancestors back to a starting point called “Aztlan‖” or “Atlan”, in the Atlantic. It was a land they described as ―too fair and beautiful to be left willingly which was lost in the sea after a great flood. Aztec temples are called ― Teocalli‖ which interestingly compares with the Greek ― theos‖ (God) and ― kalias‖ (house/dwelling of). Europeans first settling in Delaware and Maryland found a river named by the natives ―Potomac,‖ which is just like the Greek word ―Potomos‖meaning ―river. The native Basques of Western Europe also claim to be descendants of a continent called ―Atlaintika‖ which sank beneath the waves. The Basque language itself shares no lingual affinities with any other European language but is very similar to native American languages. The natives of Mindanao in the Philippines are the ―Atas‖ who have the same flood myth and claim descent from light-skinned invaders who intermarried with the aboriginals. Ignatius Donnelly writes in Atlantis: The Antediluvian World : Look at it! An ‘ Atlas’ mountain on the shore of Africa; an ‘ Atlan’ town on the shore of America; the ‘ Atlante’ living along the north and west coast of Africa; an Aztec people from Aztlan, in Central America; an ocean rolling between the two worlds called the ‘ Atlantic;’ a mythological deity called ‘ Atlas’ holding the world on his shoulders; and an immemorial tradition of an island of Atlantis. Can all these things be the result of accident ? . [55] There are basically many ancient legends in regard to a lost or sunken continent and a deluge which, though not absolutely accepted as history, are too probable to be passed over in silence. It is admitted by scientists that the surface of our earth is continually wasting away, with the result that the bed of the ocean is being slowly raised, and the geographical position of the land is changing: we see in one locality that the ocean is washing the land away, whilst in another the sea is receding. Equally great climatic changes are slowly developing; thus Greenland was at one time a torrid clime, which at a later age, to be reckoned only by tens of thousands of years, was succeeded by intense cold, and when our own island was depopulated by a deluge of ice and frost. For John Yarker, these changes are attendant upon what astronomers term the “Precession of the Equinoxes” ; as “there is a gradual displacement of the poles of the earth, occurring in cycles or periods of 25,000 years, and the last of which 227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"reached its extreme point about 12,500 years ago, when it is held that a great cataclysm occurred which changed the face of the entire globe.

N apoleon and the Pyramid of the Illuminati The Illuminati and Freemason Napoleon Bonaparte, a loyal disciple of the Jesuits, directed his troops to leave him alone when he went into the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. He was thereafter marrying into the Merovingian lineage (through Josephine), and becoming a Mason a year or so before that. Even earlier, he was recluted into the Illuminati by Grand Master Giuseppe Balsamo, known as Count Cagliostro. There was no military reason to go to Egypt, and he took many servants with him on his expedition, which began a great increase in knowledge in archaeology. On the way, he stopped briefly to defeat the island of Malta, that was in the hands of the Knights of Malta in a war with the Jesuits, who were kicked out of the Vatican. Napoleon lost almost no men, and gained this strategic island, plus the Maltese Knights hoard of assets, and who knows what kind of knowledge and books the Romans had ferreted away to this island after the destruction of the Library at Alexandria. His time in the so-called King’s Chamber lead him to be blanched and visibly shaken. Did he go there with certain knowledge gained through books or studies to ritually perform a specific viewing? Was his genetic background and connection somehow important to this ritualistic attunement? His own Tuscan (is there a connection with the Etruscan canal or terraces and Tuscan engineering in ancient America?) heritage and possible illegitimate connection to Marboeuf, and a very old noble family is worth the inspection of any historian. When he came out he told all present never to ask him what had happened or to explore the matter in any manner. On his deathbed he almost told his biographer Las Casas yet, he thought even he would not believe or understand. My guess is that Napoleon saw the future, and it was a scary one, to say the least. He may also have been influenced by some sorcery from his Illuminati handlers. I know Nostradamus worked the hieroglyphs of the Great Pyramid for inspiration, and I think Napoleon had this special advantage that 228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Nostradamus never experienced. Here is a formal quote on the event to contemplate: \"The Egyptian Campaign had a profound effect on Napoleon as well. On the 25th of Thermidor according to the revolutionary calendar (i.e. the 12th of August, 1799) Napoleon visited the Great Pyramid with Imam Muhammed as his guide. Bonaparte asked to be left alone in the King's Chamber. This was likely a gesture dictated by the dramatic part of Napoleon's character because Alexander the Great, whom Napoleon greatly admired, had done the same thing 2000 years before. Nonetheless, Las Cases relates that Napoleon emerged pale and shaken from the Chamber. {Emphasis added} He commanded that no one ever question him about what happened in the pyramid. In 'Memoirs of the Emperor Napoleon', Las Cases claims that near the end of Napoleon’s life, while in exile on the island of St. Helena, he seemed about to confide what had happened in the pyramid to Las Cases, but instead he shook his head and said: 'No~ What’s the use. You'd never believe me.\" In Memoirs of the Emperor Napoleon, Las Cases claims that near the end of Napoleon’s life, while in exile on the island of St. Helena, he seemed about to confide what had happened in the pyramid to Las Cases, but instead he shook his head and said: “ No~ What’s the use. You'd never believe me” . [56] As far as we know, he never told anyone and took the secret to his grave. (It is interesting to note that there is an unsubstantiated story that Napoleon had hinted that he was given some vision of his destiny during his stay in the King's Chamber). Alexander the Great also spent time alone in the King's Chamber like many famous people throughout history. What draws all these “illuminated” individuals, who are part of the Ancient Mystery Schools, to this possibly Sacred place? In the 1930s, author Paul Brunton spent a night there and was assailed by visions of “a circle of hostile creatures” which he likened to “elemental creations, grotesque shapes, madmen, hulking and devilish apparitions”. Was this mere hallucination? In more recent times such ideas have been put down to the background radiation given off by the black granite of the chamber, but surely if it was that simple, then 229"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"everyone who visited the chamber would experience a similar thing, wouldn't they? Early experiments indicated that the King's Chamber’s spirit stones did seem to generate an electrical field which caused minor shock to at least one poor visitor drinking from a metal hip flask! It has been suggested that the Pyramid, because of its granite blocks, could transmit and receive radio and even microwave signals very well, and some believe that it gives off energy in an “emanating apex” this means that energy spirals off the top of the structure in a circle which widens as it permeates the atmosphere. Whilst some have seen this as mere New Age baloney, others have said this confirms their suspicions that the Pyramid is some kind of beacon intended for use from space. More recently, ex-NASA consultant Richard Hoagland has stated that radioactive sand was found in a chamber behind the Queen's Chamber, which might explain both the weird experiences of Napoleon et al, and the anomalous radioactive date readings given by the Pyramid, in which it appears that the top of the structure is 1000 years older than the bottom! This has led some people to speculate that the Pyramid was constructed upside down in mid-air by alien technology and then swung over into place on the Giza Plateau. [57] Well, I have described in detail what this supposed “alien technology” is, also in relation to the Great Pyramid and the Illuminati Mystery Schools, in my next literary work, The Invisible Master: Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors and the puppet masters who pull the strings of Occult Power from The Alien World. Chapter Five The Vatican Masonic Involvement Pope Paul VI Freemason exposed! Pope Paul VI (Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini, 1897- 1978) reigned from June 21, 1963, until his death in 1978. His beatification process began on May 11, 1993. Pope Francis beatified him on October 19, 2014. He was the Pope who closed the Vatican Council II (opened by Pope John XXIII in October 1962), in December 1965. The 230"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Council changed the direction and mission of the Catholic Church. Among many other things, he abolished the use of Latin in the liturgy, prohibited the use of Pope Pius V’s Missal, and introduced the use of the vernacular through the Novus Ordo Missae. He was a humanist, a modernist and a Freemason. The Grand Master Giordano Gamberini, on the day of Giovanni Battista Montini’s election to Pope, said: “This is the man who does it for us!’” And after the death of Pope Montini the “obituary,” or better stated the eulogy, of the former Grand Master of Palazzo Giustiniani, Giordano Gamberini, on the official Masonic Magazine of the Grand Orient of Italy was unequivocal: “For us it is the death of the one who dropped the condemnation of Clement XII and his successors on us. It is the first time— in the history of modern Freemasonry—that the dying Head of the greatest Western religion was not in a state of hostility with the Freemasons.” FIG 23 – Actor Paolo Carlini (1922 – 1979) He concluded by making a shocking statement: “For the first time, in history, the Freemasons can pay homage to the tomb of a pope, without ambiguity or contradiction.” There have always been very credible charges that Paul VI was an active homosexual, and is rumored that his lover, the known Italian actor Paolo Carlini, who was an Italian stage, television and film actor and appeared in 45 films between 1940 and 1979, was later used by Freemasonry to blackmail him. Now for the first time the rumors of Pope Montini’s Masonic membership have been finally fully confirmed by an important document I have included in Confessions of an Illuminati, Volume III: Espionage, Templars, and Satanism in the Shadows of the Vatican, but decided to include here as well, because of its importance also in this book.

Is it only a strange coincidence? Let’s remember the words of an old letter from Cardinal Millini to the apostolic nuncio in Florence, Alfonso Giglioli (1622-1630), discovered in the State Archives of Florence (R., II, 148 -15,) by historian Vittorio Fincati, in the documents known as the Carte Strozziane [58] For a long time disturbing information on the nature of this city reached the ears of your Excellency. Reportedly in that city in the countryside, there is a great number of witches that corrupt many children every day ... ” Florence in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance was central to the Western Initiatic System, as an important esoteric center but, in parallel, also a center for the followers of black magic. There were many manuscripts of this discipline which circulated secretly, including the famous Picatrix, and the even more disturbing Liber vaccae , [59] which still remain in the city libraries. Vittorio Fincati, who wrote a very small essay on the subject, published only in Italy by Carpe Librum entitled, The Monster of Florence and Alchemy, states : “The more we enter these worlds of darkness the more you realize that there are many coincidences that connect the most vicious killings attributed to serial killers to certain rituals related to sexual magic.” No wonder the new headquarters of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.TO.) in Italy, is located in Florence, where their new Italian leader, Freemason of the Grand Orient of Italy, Jean-Matthieu Kleeman, for many years a key figure of the O.T.O.’s Teth Camp, also located in Florence, originally comes from.This influential group of O.T.O. magicians reached the privileged status of Teth Lodge of the O.T.O. There are only three 234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"groupsof the O.T.O. that have been given such status in Italy; one in Rome; one in Turin, and in more recent times, this one in Florence. [60] From a historical point of view, this magical tradition often bordering with Satanism is implanted in the Florence way of life. This important city had contacts with the East centuries ago, stimulated by the Crusades, that also linked them at times with unusual Islamic environments related to beliefs of pre-Islamic Hellenic origin; like the school of Harran in Syria that belonged to the Pagan \"Sabians, \" that were able to continue their faith undisturbed, even after the arrival of Islam. This was until in 1251 when Harran was eventually destroyed by a Mongol invasion. [61] So a sinister cult has been active in Florence for centuries, and for many are connected to the so-called Monster of Florence, also known as Il Mostro, an epithet commonly used for the perpetrator, or perpetrators, of 16 murders, nearly all of them couples, that took place between 1968 and 1985, in the province of Florence, Italy. Four local men – Stefano Mele, Pietro Pacciani, Mario Vanni, and Giancarlo Lotti – were arrested, charged, and convicted of the crime at different times. However, these convictions have been criticized and ridiculed in the media; critics suggest instead that the real killer or killers were never identified, and many years later the investigation unveiled the possibility that a “Regular” Masonic Lodge from Perugia protected the real perpetrators of these terrible homicides. [62] In 1991, a follower of Aleister Crowley and the Grand Master of a mysterious sect called, “The Lillith Group”, that some say constituted the original group, that later evolved into the modern Lodge of the O.T.O., published two small booklets that shocked the occult community for their sick and perverted teachings, that mixed the worst of Aleister Crowley’s ideals with that of another Italian occultist, Ciro Formisano (1888 –1963). From these teachings, that I will discuss further in The Invisible Master: Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors and the puppet masters who pull the strings of Occult Power from The Alien World , researchers like Fincati realized their possible involvement in the terrible homicides perpetrated by the so-called “Monster of Florence” referred to as an occult circle by more than one person. The occult background of Florence, and the important Satanic community still residing in this city must have gained the attention of Satanic Reverend Marilyn Manson, and of course, the first Jesuit Pope. It should be noted that the former leader of the Italian Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, is also from Florence, and some call him a Masonic creation 235"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"of the late Worshipful Master of the P2 Licio Gelli. [63] Even the myth constructed in the last 40 years around Turin being the “Satanic city” of Italy, is apparently false, driven by Satanic disinformation to avoid any connection with Florence, officially the city of lilies and love . Yes, there was indeed a group of high level Masons, who asked Anton LaVey to open their own Church of Satan in the city of Turin, in Northern Italy in the late 60’s, but soon afterward, the same group left the Church of Satan for something more serious in the realm of Satanism, linking themselves to a French Satanic cult, helping the Satanic myth of Turin to grow in the process. So welcome to Florence - the city of Love, Art, Architecture, and for some Satanism. However, karma is real, as I also said in my introduction to this book, and in late September 2017, Marilyn Manson’s concert in New York came to a scary and abrupt end, when two giant props came crashing down on him while he was performing on stage, sending the Satanic rocker to the hospital. Maybe the infamous beheading of Donald Trump, made a year earlier, in one of his demented music videos, triggered a fatal karmic reaction for Mr. Manson. The same kind of reaction, seems to have also affected another musician working for the dark side, the superstar of today, Lady Gaga, also a prominent supporter of Hillary Clinton, who had to suddenly cancel her tour dates, after she was rushed to hospital with chronic pain, always in the month of September 2017, almost at the same time when Netflix put out a fascinating and dramatic documentary based on the artist, called Gaga: Five Foot Two is the crux of it all , directed by Chris Moukarbel. The documentary showed Lady Gaga’s evident signs and links to the Satanic side of the Illuminati and the O.T.O., in particular. She even used the music originally recorded for Kenneth Anger’s Lucifer Rising at California State Prison, by Bobby BeauSoleil’s band The Freedom Orchestra. Large sections of this unusual Satanic performance were incorporated into Lady Gaga’s documentary, showing her in poses miming the rituals enacted in this 70’s cult film. Beausoleil is serving a life sentence in California's state prison system for the July 27, 1969, murder of music teacher and Manson Family friend Gary Hinman, a crime that also involved Charles Manson and several members of his cult, also linked to the O.T.O.

The Vatican’s attempts to overthrow Trump, and their denial of Satanism Last February MSN News wrote: Most of Donald Trump's opponents believe they will have to wait four more years to see him leave the White House. But America's witches are more optimistic. At the stroke of midnight on Friday, followers of witchcraft across the US performed a mass spell designed to remove the president from office. A Facebook group devoted to the ritual has attracted over 10,500 likes and coined the hashtag #magicresistance. The development has sparked fury among Christian conservatives, who have accused the witches of“declaring spiritual war”. What most people don’t know is that the person responsible for organizing this is not your average pagan witch, but a Christian, Catholic-raised Michael M. Hughes who lives in Baltimore, and is the author of both fiction and nonfiction, that is regularly promoted by the liberal media. When he isn’t writing, he speaks on Fortean, paranormal, and other topics, and teaches workshops on the Tarot. Michael Hughes is not only a Freemason but also a mentalist and a member of the Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis (SRICF) , a Christian Rosicrucian organization where membership not only requires affiliation with a Symbolic Lodge of Freemasonry but a profession of the Christian faith. While membership in the York Rite Bodies is not necessarily required, most of the members of the SRICF often hold membership in the Jesuit controlled York Rite and many of its appendant bodies. Membership is also limited to 72 members per presiding body, making it also quite elitarian, but definitely not pagan. So Michael Hughes who describes himself publicly as a pagan witch on a mission to destroy Trump, without actually being one, and describes president Donald J. Trump as “an inept, bullying demagogue,” devised a dangerous black magic ritual, To be performed at midnight on every waning crescent moon until he is removed from office.

See below for the upcoming dates. Some lodges/covens are doing a variation of this as a group working, while a number of solitary practitioners are planning to connect and live stream via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. After the huge success of his initiative on the mainstream media, Michael Hughes went on to make this shocking statement: Donald Trump continues to spectacularly combust. He’s falling to pieces in front of us with every vacuous boast, every stroke of his executive pen, and every brazen lie (he hates, for example, when someone suggests his thing is smaller than someone else’s thing). But his people, his most fervent supporters (the MAGOTs, as I’ve come to call them), continue to heap praise on him, and with every burning chunk of the tower that falls they cheer even louder. Michael Hughes is obviously delusional about the results of his magical rituals, as he is working for the increasingly Satanic left wing, still dominated by that witch of Hillary Clinton that is trying to use every trick in the book, including Black Magic by the Illuminati sectarian network, to stop Trump doing his job as president, a job she could have never done. In the meantime, not only is Satanism being made more acceptable, but Father Arturo Sosa SJ, 31st General of the Society of Jesus, and the first non-European general of the Jesuits has shocked the Catholic world in a recent interview to El Mundo, the second largest printed daily newspaper in Spain. Arturo Sosa (b. 1948), is someone who seems to be a reflection of the Pontiff, one the black Pope (Father Sosa), and the other the white Pope (Francis) . They are not only the two most powerful figures in Catholicism today but also two of the most influential people in the diabolic Jesuit led New World Order. Sosa is not only Latin American, like Bergoglio, but also just as progressive, who says the devil is only a symbol of evil. Sosa made this surprising statement on the figure of the devil: \"From my perspective, evil is part of the ministry of liberty. If the human being is free, he can choose between good and evil. We Christians believe 239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"to be made in the image in the likeness of God, so God is free, but God always chooses to do good because it is all goodness. We created symbolic figures, like the devil, to express the evil. The social conditioning also represents this figure, there are people who act this way because there is an environment where it is very difficult to do the opposite.\" [64] The Bible shows that Satan does exist and has great power, but for the Black Pope he is just a convenient figment of our imagination. Well Miguel de Cervantes in Don Quixote (Book IV, Part I, Chapter X) wrote: Wherever God erects a house of prayer, The Devil always builds a chapel there: And 'twill be found, upon examination, The latter has the largest congregation. The Jesuits came into existence in the same period of time that saw Cervantes writing these profound words of wisdom. A quote by Charles Baudelaire seems to fit Arturo Sosa’s view: La plus belle des ruses du diable est de vous persuader qu'il n'existe pas . The devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does The values of Pope Francis, which include tolerance for pedophilia, are the values of the late Roman Empire before its demise. A demographic and economic crisis piloted by the elite existed back then, as well as out-of- control immigration, and a loss in moral beliefs, and political ideology, just like today in the era of globalization, and the New World Order. The Roman Empire, that for six centuries held the entire Mediterranean area under their control, suddenly submitted and gave in to its enemies. The turning point for this disaster was in 378 a.d., with the Battle of Adrianople, sometimes known as the Battle of Hadrianopolis, a defeat in which the emperor himself was killed by those Goths which, a few years earlier, were given refugee status in Roman territory, as refugees fleeing from war. From then on, the story of Rome was marked my dear readers, and soon Europe could face the same fate if President Trump does not help to rectify the situation. Ok, in the US you might have a slightly detached vision of Europe’s present crisis, but remember once Europe falls, the next in line is the United States of America, and finally the whole breakdown of civilization. In this case, Daniel 2:42 might come in handy as a prophetic reference to the story.

This means it would be made up of people who “will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay” (Daniel 2:41-43). Remember the Roman Empire exists in two parts. The first is the historical Roman Empire, while the foundation of the second phase can be seen in the European Community, now referred to as the European Union (EU). Western civilization is reaching what is called “Societal collapse”, and it seems like it is simply History Repeating, like the title of the famous song by Miss Shirley Bassey- Welcome to the end , or rather for many Christians, the enactment of, The Book of Revelation , which is one of the most controversial and least understood books of the Bible regarding the time just before Christ’s return to earth, and what He will do afterward. Earlier this year, in 2017, I wrote an article about Pope Francis’ refusal to renew Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller's mandate as Prefect of the Holy Office. Immediately afterward, we saw the unfortunate death of Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop Emeritus of Cologne, best known recently, as co-author of the Dubia sent to Pope Francis. However, even if the German station, Domradio stated that Meisner died peacefully in his sleep while on vacation in Bad Füssing, most of us know by now, that is a total media fabrication. Meisner was, in fact, upset with Pope Francis until the last hours of his life, regarding Müller’s treatment, and the way Bergoglio fired him. These actions triggered an internal war in the Vatican, where the pedophile network is now basically divided into two factions. One faction, closer to Pope Francis, and the Gay lobby wants a more liberal Church, ready to embrace homosexuality for priests, and an open support for Islam and the upcoming One World Religion, that will gradually push for the acceptance of pedophilia. This faction is represented by Cardinals such as Coccopalmiero, involved in the Gay Orgy raid, or Godfried Cardinal Danneels of the St. Gallen Mafia. The other faction, the more conservative one, mostly controlled by Pope Ratzinger the Pope Emeritus, is instead contrary to any liberal change imposed on the Catholic Faith by the Jesuit Pope, but still hides terrible compromises and links to the infamous pedophilia rings that are hidden behind the Catholic hierarchy. Then we heard the harsh criticism towards Pope Francis even in Ratzinger’s own words, that was recited in the Cathedral of Cologne 241"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"during Meisner’s funeral that took place in the middle of the summer of 2017. This was a sign of open War between the two pedophile factions, and soon after the liberal faction, filtered yet another scandal, that could damage the conservative uprise in the Church. Always during the summer of 2017, in Regensburg 547, children of the choir of the Ratisbonian Cathedral, directed for 30 years by Pope Emeritus’ brother, George Ratzinger, have been abused in various ways over four decades, and 67 were also subject to acts of pedophilia from Catholic priests and teachers. Lawyer Ulrich Weber’s final report disclosed by the German media stated that 49 perpetrators have been identified, and George Ratzinger, who was the director of the ensemble for thirty years “knew and closed his eyes”. Pope Francis and his liberal faction have also done this to isolate the then bishop of Regensburg, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, ex- prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, who admitted the existence of abuse in the German choir back in 2010, and is now accused of refusing dialogue with the families of the victims. The former prefect is also accused by Marie Collins, a resigning member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of minors, and a victim herself, of having done little to fight pedophilia in the Vatican, and even going to the extent of hindering the work Pope Francis’ team. This is not completely true, as it was Pope Francis who ordered Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller to act in this way. Well, as many Vatican experts have already written, this Pontifical Commission was a joke anyway, and Peter Saunders, a Briton who was abused by two priests as a teenager, left the Commission in disgust, stating it was only a “ public relations exercise”. War of the pedophiles continues in the next episode of the Vatican decline, that coincides of course with the decline of the Western Initiatic System and the rise of Satanism. La Civiltà Cattolica (Italian for Catholic Civilization), is a periodical published by the Jesuits in Rome, Italy. It has been published continuously since 1850, and this year they launched an English edition, presented at Her Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador Residence to the Holy See, on February 28th, 2017. The Editor in Chief of La Civiltà Cattolica is the influential Jesuit Fr. Antonio Spadaro SJ. In an unprecedented move, Spadaro has written and published in the English edition of La Civiltà Cattolica , an open criticism towards Donald J. Trump, and American Christianity in the United States stating that: President Trump steers the fight against a wider, generic collective entity 242"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"of the “bad” or even the “very bad.” Sometimes the tones used by his supporters in some campaigns take on meanings that we could define as “epic.” These stances are based on Christian-Evangelical fundamentalist principles dating from the beginning of the 20th Century that have been gradually radicalized. Popular Italian journalist Marcello Bussi from the newspaper Milano Finanza commented on the article on his FB profile writing in shock: “The Vatican declares war on Trump and his diabolical strategist Bannon”. After reading the article I will add that the Jesuits are declaring war not only on Trump but on American Christianity. Jesuits write, in fact, about American Christians in the following way: They profess “dominionism” and consider ecologists as people who are against the Christian faith. They place their own roots in a literalist understanding of the creation narratives of the book of Genesis that put humanity in a position of “dominion” over creation, while creation remains subject to human will in biblical submission. In this theological vision, natural disasters, dramatic climate change, and the global ecological crisis are not only not perceived as an alarm that should lead them to reconsider their dogmas, but they are seen as the complete opposite: signs that confirm their non-allegorical understanding of the final figures of the Book of Revelation and their apocalyptic hope in a “new heaven and a new earth.” Theirs is a prophetic formula: fight the threats to American Christian values and prepare for the imminent justice of an Armageddon, a final showdown between Good and Evil, between God and Satan. In this sense, every process (be it of peace, dialogue, etc.) collapses before the needs of the end, the final battle against the enemy. And the community of believers (faith) becomes a community of combatants (fight). Such a unidirectional reading of the biblical texts can anesthetize consciences or actively support the most atrocious and dramatic portrayals of a world that is living beyond the frontiers of its own “promised land.” I find this to be the final declaration of war against America made by the Jesuits and Pope Francis, so it’s about time we openly declare war on their pedophile networks, and also on their Vatican Money Laundering schemes, that Pope Francis is seemingly trying to protect; like Libero 243"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Milone former Auditor General until June 2017, and earlier Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, ex-President of the Institute for Works of Religion, also known as the Vatican Bank (from 2009 to 2012), tried to point out, after both were kicked out in a brutal way, because of their demand for honesty and transparency in the Vatican , something the Vatican obviously dislikes!  The Vatican’s decline, and Trump’s threat to destroy the Rothschild’s mondialist plans In 2017 , LifeSiteNews reports that a leading scholar in the Roman Catholic Church, pointed out something I wrote years ago in my book, Pope Francis: The Last Pope? He claims that God appeared to him in a vision, to warn him about Pope Francis being a “false prophet”. Father Thomas Weinandy is the former doctrine chief of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), after losing his job for writing a harsh letter of criticism to Pope Francis in which he said his papacy is marked by “chronic confusion,” the diminishment of doctrine, and a culture of fear. Back in 2013, Pope Francis awarded Fr. Weinandy one of the highest honors in the Catholic Church, the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal. 244"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"However, Father Thomas Weinandy was truly illuminated by in 2017 when he received a message that God wanted him to deliver to the world: Your Holiness, I write this letter with love for the Church and sincere respect for your office. You are the Vicar of Christ on earth, the shepherd of his flock, the successor to St. Peter and so the rock upon which Christ will build his Church. All Catholics, clergy and laity alike, are to look to you with filial loyalty and obedience grounded in truth. The Church turns to you in a spirit of faith, with the hope that you will guide her in love. Yet, Your Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate. The light of faith, hope, and love is not absent, but too often it is obscured by the ambiguity of your words and actions. This fosters within the faithful a growing unease. It compromises their capacity for love, joy, and peace. Allow me to offer a few brief examples. First, there is the disputed Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia.\" I need not share my own concerns about its content. Others, not only theologians but also cardinals and bishops, have already done that. The main source of concern is the manner of your teaching. In \"Amoris Laetitia,\" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching. As you wisely note, pastors should accompany and encourage persons in irregular marriages; but ambiguity persists about what that \"accompaniment\" actually means. To teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it. Moreover, only where there is truth can there be authentic love, for truth is the light that sets women and men free from the blindness of sin, a darkness that kills the life of the soul. Yet you seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia\" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism. This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry. Some of your advisors regrettably seem to engage in similar actions. Such behavior gives the impression that your views cannot survive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by \"ad hominem\" arguments. 245"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" Second, too often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine. Again and again, you portray the doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life. Your critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology. But it is precisely Christian doctrine – including the fine distinctions made with regard to central beliefs like the Trinitarian nature of God; the nature and purpose of the Church; the Incarnation; the Redemption; and the sacraments – that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel. Those who devalue the doctrines of the Church separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth. What they then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death. Third, faithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them. What scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice. This weakens the zeal of the many women and men who have championed authentic Catholic teaching over long periods of time, often at the risk of their own reputations and well-being. As a result, many of the faithful, who embody the \"sensus fidelium,\" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd. Fourth, the Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity. But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite. Encouraging a form of \"synodality\" that allows and promotes various doctrinal and moral options within the Church can only lead to more theological and pastoral confusion. Such synodality is unwise and, in practice, works against collegial unity among bishops. Holy Father, this brings me to my final concern. You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church. You have frequently encouraged, particularly during the two past synods, all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think. But have you noticed that the majority of bishops throughout the world are remarkably silent? Why is this? Bishops are quick learners, 246"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"and what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it. Many bishops are silent because they desire to be loyal to you, and so they do not express – at least publicly; privately is another matter – the concerns that your pontificate raises. Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse. I have often asked myself: \"Why has Jesus let all of this happen?\" The only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church, even among too many of her bishops. Ironically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness. In recognizing this darkness, the Church will humbly need to renew herself, and so continue to grow in holiness. Holy Father, I pray for you constantly and will continue to do so. May the Holy Spirit lead you to the light of truth and the life of love so that you can dispel the darkness that now hides the beauty of Jesus’ Church. Sincerely in Christ, Thomas G. Weinandy, O.F.M., Cap. July 31, 2017 Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola FatherWeinandy shortly after the publication of this letter and after a conversation with the secretary general of the episcopal conference of the United States, handed in his resignation as an advisor to the doctrinal commission of the conference. Thomas Weinandy describes with these words to Robert Royal, the president of the Faith & Reason Institute based in Washington, the miraculous events that inspired him to write this shocking letter to Pope Francis: Last May I was in Rome for an International Theological Commission meeting. I was staying at Domus Sanctae Marthae, and since I arrived early, I spent most of the Sunday afternoon prior to the meeting on Monday in Saint Peter’s praying in the Eucharistic Chapel. I was praying 247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"about the present state of the Church and the anxieties I had about the present Pontificate. I was beseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused. I was also pondering whether or not I should write and publish something expressing my concerns and anxiety. On the following Wednesday afternoon, at the conclusion of my meeting, I went again to St. Peter’s and prayed in the same manner. That night I could not get to sleep, which is very unusual for me. It was due to all that was on my mind pertaining to the Church and Pope Francis. At 1:15 AM I got up and went outside for short time. When I went back to my room, I said to the Lord: “If you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign. This is what the sign must be. Tomorrow morning I am going to Saint Mary Major’s to pray and then I am going to Saint John Lateran. After that, I am coming back to Saint Peter’s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine. During that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time and would never expect to see in Rome at this time. That person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain. Moreover, that person has to say to me in the course of our conversation, ‘Keep up the good writing’.” The next morning I did all of the above and by the time I met my seminarian friend for lunch what I had asked the Lord the following night was no longer in the forefront of my mind. However, towards the end of the meal, an archbishop appeared between two parked cars right in front of our table (we were sitting outside). I had not seen him for over twenty years, long before he became an archbishop. We recognized one another immediately. What made his appearance even more unusual was that, because of his recent personal circumstances, I would never have expected to see him in Rome or anywhere else, other than in his own archdiocese. (He was from none of the above-mentioned countries.) We spoke about his coming to Rome and caught up on what we were doing. I then introduced him to my seminarian friend. He said to my friend that we had met a long time ago and that he had, at that time, just finished reading my book on the immutability of God and the Incarnation. He told my friend that it was an excellent book, that it helped him sort out the issue, and that my friend should read the book. Then he turned to me and said: “Keep up the good writing.” 248"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"I could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes. But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something. I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used. I considered it an apostolic mandate. So giving it considerable thought and after writing many drafts, I decided to write Pope Francis directly about my concerns. However, I always intended to make it public since I felt many of my concerns were the same concerns that others had, especially among the laity, and so I publicly wanted to give voice to their concerns as well. The criticism of this senior figure of the Church towards Pope Francis are somehow confirmed once again by the mysterious author of The Dictator Pope , initially a controversial ebook signed by the pseudonymous “Marcantonio Colonna” which has risen in 2017 to 4th place on Amazon Kindle’s Religion and Spirituality bestseller list, before being relaunched officially in April 2018 with the real name of the author. In particular, this book reveals a supposed ”disappeared report”, authored by Peter Hans Kolvenbach , former Superior General of the Society of Jesus, who allegedly stated that a younger Pope Francis was “unsuitable” to be made a Bishop because of ”character defects”. In an interview with The Catholic Herald , the author of the book stated that it is not a rumor, but first-hand information from a priest who read the report. Topics of discussion in the book include also most of what I already denounced myself in Pope Francis: The Last Pope? Adding a few recent elements to the table, like the ongoing troubles in reforming the Vatican Bank. According to The Australian , outside of theological concerns, a major topic in the book is, in fact, what the author views as the failure of Pope Francis’ papacy when it comes to financial reform and the elimination of corruption in the ever so decadent Vatican. The author of The Dictator Pope specifically accuses four cardinals of obstructing financial reform; Secretary of State Pietro Parolin , the head of the Vatican Bank, Domenico Calcagno , the Prefect for Catholic Education Giuseppe Versaldi and the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, Giuseppe Bertello .

After attending lectures by the theosophist C.W. Leadbeater, he joined the Theosophical Society of Los Angeles, of which he became vice-president in 1904 and 1905. He also was very close to another member of the Theosophical Society, the Illuminati and Mystic Freemason, Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). During his short stay in Germany, he developed a sincere admiration for this knowledgeable lecturer, as later shown in the dedication of his magnum opus (“esteemed teacher and valued friend”). He sat in on several lectures and had one or two interviews with Steiner, where he learned about occult truth from the founder of Anthroposophy, but at the same time he understood that this teacher could not help him to advance along the path of spiritual development. It was then, with his mind already made up to return, feeling that he had given up important work in America, to take this trip, that Heindel reports to have been visited by an Invisible Master , a Spiritual being. FIG 27 – Max Heindel (1865-1919) was born as Carl Louis Fredrik Grasshoff. When he emigrated to America his name changed. The highly evolved entity that visited Heindel eventually identified himself as an Elder Brother of the Rosicrucian Order , an Order in the 252"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"inner worlds formed in the year 1313, that had no direct connection to physical organizations which call themselves by this name. As he mentions afterward, the Elder Brother gave him information which was concise and logical, and beyond anything, he was capable of writing. Later, he found out that during a previous visit of the Elder Brother, he was tested to determine his worthiness to be a messenger of the Western Initiatic System, he defined as the messenger of the Western Wisdom Teachings . He recounts that only then, was he given instruction on how to reach the etheric Temple of the Rose Cross, near the German/Bohemian border, and how at this Temple, he would be in direct communication with, and under the personal instructions of, the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross. The Rosicrucian Order is described as being composed of twelve Elder Brothers, gathered around a thirteenth who is the Invisible Head . These great Adepts, who belong to human evolution, but have already advanced far beyond the cycle of rebirth, are reported as being among those exalted Beings who guide mankind's evolution, the Compassionate Ones. [65] This is a rather clear vision of the core of the Western Initiatic System, views present also in other important authors and students of the esoteric world, that I embrace and find accurate. However, Max Heindel, also wrote a very interesting exposition, and occult investigation, about Freemasonry and the Catholic Church, that I still find rather relevant to my investigation in the decline of the Western Initiatic System, and this chapter in particular. For this reason, I include a brief extract from his booklet Freemasonry and Catholicism, and the chapter entitled Lucifer the Rebel Angel , that while pointing out the important mission of Mystic Masonry, calls “Lucifer their great leader”, referring to Freemasonry. Let’s try to understand more about this unusual and powerful perspective: The Rosicrucian Fellowship aims to educate and construct, to be charitable even to those from whom we differ, and never to vent the venom of vituperation, spite, or malice even upon those who seem deliberately determined to mislead. We revere the Catholic religion; it is as divine in its essence, as both were born to further the aspiration of the striving soul, and both have a message and a mission in the world not apparent upon the surface today, because man-made ceremonial as a scale, has hidden the present articles to remove that scale and show the Cosmic purpose of these two Great Organizations, which are so bitterly antagonistic to each other. 253"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"We do not aim to reconcile them, however, for though they are both designed to further the emancipation of the soul, their methods are different, and the attributes of the soul fostered by one method will indeed be very different from the quality of the soul nurtured in the other School. Therefore, the strife must continue until the battle for the souls of men has been lost and won. The issue is not, however, the persistence of the Masonic or Catholic institutions; but the outcome will determine the nature of the training humanity will receive in the remaining Periods of our evolution. We shall endeavor to show the cosmic root of both of these institutions, the purpose of each and the training which each will inaugurate, if successful; also the nature of the soul quality which may be expected to result from each method. THE WRITER IS NOT A MASON, AND THUS HE IS FREE TO SAY WHAT HE KNOWS WITHOUT FEAR OF VIOLATING OBLIGATIONS, BUT HE IS A MASON AT HEART, AND THEREFORE FRANKLY OPPOSED TO CATHOLICISM. Our opposition is not fanatical, or blind to the merits of the Catholic Religion, however. The Catholic is our brother as well as the Mason; we would not say a disparaging, irreverent word against this faith, or those who live by it, and should we seem to do so, in any passage, the wrong will be due to inadvertence. The reader is requested to note that we distinguish sharply between the Catholic Hierarchy and the Catholic Religion , but the former are also our brothers; we would not throw stones either physically or morally, for we know our own shortcomings too well to attack others. Thus our opposition is not personal, but spiritual, and to be fought with the weapon of the Spirit-- Reason. We firmly believe it to be for the everlasting good of mankind that the Masons should win, and cannot, therefore, be sure to present the Catholic side in a perfectly unbiased manner, but we ask our students for whom this is written, to believe that we shall try to be just. Of the Cosmic Facts, we are certain, but bias may creep into our conclusions, therefore each must use his reason to test what we have to say, viz., prove all things and hold fast that which is good. The great law of analogy is everywhere the master key of all spiritual mysteries, and, although Masonry and Catholicism do not begin till we arrive at the Earth Period, they have their prototype in the earlier Periods; we shall therefore briefly touch upon the essential facts. In the Saturn Period, the Earth-in-the-making was dark; HEAT, which is the 254"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"manifestation of the ever invisible fire, was the only element then manifest; embryonic mankind was mineral-like, the only lower kingdom of evolving life. Unity was everywhere observable, and the Lords of Mind who were human then were at one among themselves. In the Western Wisdom Teaching, we speak of the highest Initiate of the Saturn Period as THE FATHER. In the Sun Period the root of a new element, AIR, was evolved and coalesced with the true fire, which, mark again, is always invisible, and which manifested as HEAT in the Saturn Period. Then fire burst into FLAMES, and the dark world became a blazing ball of luminous firemist at the word of power, LET THERE BE LIGHT. Let the student ponder well the relation of FIRE and FLAME; the former lies sleeping, invisible in everything, and is kindled into light in various ways: by a blow of a hammer upon a stone, by the friction of wood against wood and by chemical action, etc. This gives us a clue to the identity and state of THE FATHER, \"whom no man hath seen at any time\" but who is revealed in \"The Light of the World,\" the Son, who is the highest Initiate of the Sun Period. As the unseen fire is revealed in the flame, so also the fullness of the Father dwelt in the Son, and they are one as fire is one with the flame in which it manifests. This is the root of all true Sun and Fire worship. All look beyond the physical symbol and adore Our Father Who art in Heaven. The Mystic Masons of today hold this faith in the fire as firmly as ever. Thus it will be seen that the Unity which prevailed in the Saturn Period continued in the Sun Period. The ordinary humanity of that time has now evolved to the glory of Archangels; some were more advanced than others, but there was no antagonism among them. Our present humanity had advanced to a plantlike stage, and was slightly above the new Lifewave started in the Sun Period, and unity also here prevailed. In the Moon Period contact of the heated sphere with cold Space generated moisture, and the battle of the elements commenced in all its fierceness. The heated ball of fire endeavored to evaporate the moisture, force it outwards and create a vacuum wherein to maintain its integrity and burn undisturbed; but there is and can be no void in nature, hence the outrushing steam condensed at a certain distance from the heated ball and was again driven inwards by the cold of Space, to be again evaporated and propelled outwards, in a ceaseless round for ages and ages, as a shuttlecock between the separate 255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Hierarchies of Spirits composing the various Kingdoms of Life, represented in the Fire-Sphere and Cosmic Space which is an expression of the Homogeneous Absolute Spirit. The Fire Spirits are actively striving to attain enlargement of consciousness. But the Absolute rests ever clothed in the invisible garment of Cosmic Space. In 'It' all powers and possibilities are LATENT, and It seeks to discourage and check any attempt at an expenditure of latent power as the dynamic energy required in the evolution of a solar system. Water is the agent It used to quench the fire of active spirits. The zone between the heated center of the separate Spirit Sphere, and the Point where its individual atmosphere meets Cosmic Space is a battleground of evolving spirits at various stages of evolution. The present Angels were human in the Moon Period, and the highest Initiate is The Holy Spirit, (Jehovah).As our humanity and the other Kingdoms of Life on earth are variously affected by the present elements, so that some like heat, others prefer cold, some thrive on moisture and others require dryness, so also in the Moon Period among the Angels, some had affinity for water, others abhorred it and loved fire. The continued cycles of condensation and evaporation of the moisture surrounding the fiery center eventually caused incrustation, and it was the purpose of Jehovah to mold this red earth, translated ADAM, into forms wherein to imprison and QUENCH THE SPIRITS OF THE FIRE. To this end, He issued the creative fiat, and theprototypes of fish, fowl and every living thing appeared, even including the primitive human form, which were created by His Angels; thus He hoped to make all that lives and moves subservient to His will. Against this plan a minority of the Angels rebelled; they had too great an affinity for FIRE to bear contact with water, and refused to create the forms as ordered; but thereby they at the same time deprived themselves of an opportunity of evolution along the conventional lines, and became an anomaly in nature; furthermore, having repudiated the authority of Jehovah, they must work out their own salvation in their own manner. How this has been accomplished by LUCIFER, their Great Leader will be made plain in the following articles; for the present, suffice it to say, that in the Earth Period, when various planets were differentiated to provide proper evolutionary environment for each class of Spirits, the Angels under Jehovah were setto work with the inhabitants of ALL PLANETS HAVING MOONS; while the Lucifer Spirits have their abode upon the planet Mars. The Angel GABRIEL is representative on earth, of 256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"the Lunar Hierarchy, presided over by Jehovah; the Angel SAMAEL is an ambassador of the Martial forces of Lucifer. Gabriel (who announced the coming birth of Jesus to Mary,) and his lunar angels are therefore the givers of physical life, while Samael and the hosts of Mars are the Angels of Death. Thus originated the feud in the dim dawn of this Cosmic day, and that which we see as Free Masonry today is an attempt by the HIERARCHS OF FIRE, the Lucifer Spirits, to bring us the imprisoned spirit 'LIGHT,' that by it we may SEE and KNOW. Catholicism is an activity of the HIERARCHS OF WATER, and places 'HOLY WATER' at the Temple door to quench the spirits seeking light and knowledge and to inculcate FAITH in Jehovah. As the vernal equinox is said to be at the first point of Aries, no matter where in the constellations it falls by precession, so the point where the human seed-atom comes from the invisible world and is taken in hand by the Lunar God of Generation, Jehovah, through his ambassador, the Angel Gabriel, is esoterically the first point of Cancer. This is the Cardinal sign of the watery Triplicity and is ruled by the Moon. There Conception takes place, but were the form built of water and its concretions alone, it could never come to birth, so four months later when the foetus has reached the stage of development corresponding to the second sign of the watery triplicity, Scorpio, the eighth sign, which corresponds to the house of death, Samael, the dauntless ambassador of the Lucifer Spirits, invades the watery domain of the Lunar Hierarchy and introduces the fiery spark of the spirit into the inert form, to leaven, quicken and mould it into an expression of itself. There the Silver Cord which has grown from the seed-atom of the dense body (located in the heart) since conception, is welded to the part that has sprouted from the central vortex of the desire body, (located in the liver,) and when the Silver Cord is tied by the seed-atom of the vital body, (located in the solar plexus,) the spirit DIES to life in the supersensible world, and quickens the body it is to use in its coming earth life. This life on earth lasts until the course of events foreshadowed in the wheel of life, the horoscope, has been run; and when the spirit again reaches the realm of Samael, the Angel of Death, the mystic eighth house, the silver cord is loosed, and the spirit returns to God who gave it, until the dawn of another Life-day in the School of earth beckons it to a new birth that it may acquire more skill in the arts and crafts of temple-building. About five months after the quickening, when the last of the watery signs, 257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Pisces, has been passed, the representative of the Lucifer Spirits, Samael, focuses the forces of the fiery sign, Aries, where Mars is positively polarized, so that under the impulse of their dynamic energy the waters of the womb are voided, and the imprisoned spirit is liberated into the physical world, to fight the battle of life. It may blindly butt its head against the Cosmic forces typified by the first of the fiery signs , Aries, the Ram , which is a symbol of the brute strength brought to bear upon the problems of life by the most primitive races; or it may adopt the more modern method of cunning, as a means of attaining mastery over others, which characteristic is indicated in the second of the fiery signs, Leo, the Lion, the king of beasts ; or perchance it may rise above the animal nature, and aim at the stars with the bow of spiritual aspiration, typified by the last of the fiery signs, Sagittarius, the Centaur . The Centaur is just ahead of the watery sign Scorpio, a warning that one who tries to reach that prerogative as “PHREE MESSEN,” a son of Fire and Light, will surely feel the sting of the Scorpion in his heel, which will goad him onward upon the path where men become “wise as serpents.” It is from this class that Mystic Masonry is recruited with men who have the indomitable courage TO DARE, the unflagging energy TO DO and the diplomatic discrimination TO BE SILENT. (End of Max Heindel extract from Freemasonry and Catholicism - emphasis ours ) The roots of ROSICRUCIANISM In regards to the mysterious Rosicrucians we already saw what William Walker Atkinson wrote under the pseudonym Magus Incognito, in The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians I cited earlier, however, Ufologist and Illuminati Allen H. Greenfield (b.1946), who was given the mystical title of Tau Sir Hasirim, by Hierophant Michael Bertiaux of Chicago, tells us that the concept of Rosicrucianism “defies sharp or clear definition” and “Its origins may be similar to that of Freemasonry and the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, but like these venerable institutions, its true origins are lost in the thick mists of occult history.” Well, all this seems rather chaotic, however, Greenfield seems to clear up the matter for us by writing: “All that we can say for certain is that certain intriguing Rosicrucian documents begin appearing in the early 1600s, but claiming to describe earlier events. The Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis appeared in 258"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"1614. The Confessio Fraternitatis or simply The Confessio , was printed in Kassel (Germany) the following year. The Chymical Wedding - known also as The Hermetick Romance appears in 1616 and is generally considered the work of a young pastor named Johann Valentin Andreae(1586-1654) . Like other Rosicrucian works, controversy surrounds even this claim.” [66] In the controversial Rosicrucian history only one thing is certain, in 1622, the inhabitants of Paris woke up to find the walls of their city covered with posters bearing the following message: We, deputies of the principal College of the Brethren of the Rose Cross (Rosicrucians) are amongst you in this town, visibly and invisibly, through the grace of the Most High to whom the hearts of all just men are turned, in order to save our fellow-men from the error of death’. Since then, the secretive nature of the Rosicrucians, typical of the Illuminati sect since time immemorial, makes it difficult, or at times impossible, to get any reliable historical information on their true origins or their real mission. John Yarker made initially the following statement in one of his earlier works published in 1872: We shall see from the following account of the Society of Christian Rosy Cross, that it claims to date from about the year 1400, but we do not read of the association under that name prior to 1600, and the impossibility of the narrative points out to us that the name of the founder is mythical, and that it is no doubt of antiquity. We have indeed nothing beyond the Rosicrucian writings to prove that an order, with proper organizations, existed, under the name of Rosicrucians, but it is claimed that the so-called Rosy Cross brethren passed through a number of degrees- seven or nine- to perfection. (Scientific and Religious Mysteries of Antiquity , p. 74) Yarker continues to mention in the following pages the possible connections and links between Freemasonry, the Rosicrucians, and Alchemy. He will go back to the subject of Rosicrucianism in a much more detailed way, bringing up some hard evidence, and interesting facts, in its late masterpiece, The Arcane Schools , published in 1909, only fours years before his death, a masterpiece of his time that continues to be to this day, one of the most comprehensive and authoritative works concerning the history of the Arcane mysteries, and the affinity with both the Masonic System and to a minor extent, Rosicrucianism. Bill Heidrick, a senior 259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"figure in today’s Ordo Templi Orientis writes that “This book provides a background necessary to understand elements of the. Golden Dawn and O.T.O. initiations,” For this reason, I decided to pick up from this rare publication, the most interesting revelations made by Yarker in regards to the subject of Rosicrucianism, editing them together with a few extra bits to make certain element even more clear to the modern reader. Let’s start with the possible origins of the Rosicrucian Fraternity. In the 13th century, we find traces of an organized body of men professedly Christian, who had organized themselves after the manner of the Oriental Societies. The name with which we head this article had not then become prominent, but at a later period, it became the generic title by which everything of the nature of Cabalism, Theosophy, Alchemy, Astrology, and Mysticism was designated. It is stated in a Rosicrucian MS., lying at Cologne under the nom-de-plume of Omnis Moriar, that a Society termed the Magical Union was established in this city in the year 1115. F. C. E. Weise mentions it Rosenkreutzer in seiner Blosse , (Amsterdam, 1786), and gives the conditions for entering this body of “Wise Men,” the last and youngest possessors of the secrets of the ancients; the Initiates wore a triangle as symbolising power, wisdom, and love. They had secret sciences, known only to the highest among them, called Mu- alpha-gamma-omicron-sigma , Mage, or Wise Masters, able to do things that seemed supernatural. These days Fraternities and sororities , known also as Greek letter organizations (GLOs) , use these letters for social organizations at colleges and universities. Such groups were, however, born as the intersection between dining clubs, literary societies, and secret initiatory orders such as Freemasonry. But let's return to Rosicrucianism. Traces of an organized body are to be found in the Rosary of Arnold de Villanova, circa 1230, inasmuch as the Cabalistic term of “Sons of the Order” is used. In the Theoria of Raymond Lulli circa 1322, there is a passage in which mention is made of a “Societas Physicorum” and also of a “Rex Physicorum”. Also in the Theatrum Chemicum Argentoratum , 1628, a Count von Falkenstein, Prince Bishop of Treves in the 14th century, is termed “Most Illustrious and Serene Prince and father of Philosophers.” Hence it would seem that besides the Moorish Schools which existed in Spain, “there were similar associations amongst Christians. It is not difficult to account for the transmission of such Brotherhoods from ancient times, since the Cabalists and Gnostics studied the secret arts, and it is quite probable that the persecutions to which these 260"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"were subjected were prompted rather by alarm than any real abhorrence of their pretended heretical doctrine. A few of the more curious and important works may be mentioned here.The Romance of the Rose is an Initiative system in the Allegory of the joyful science, in which the term Love is used Theosophically. Eliphas Levi says : It is the most curious literary and scientific work of the middle ages, it carries on the chain of the tradition of Initiation . Heckethorn holds that, it divides the degrees into four and three, producing again the Mystic number seven . . . . it describes a castle surrounded by a sevenfold wall, which is covered with emblematical figures, and no one was admitted into the castle who could not explain their mysterious meaning . Amant is admitted into this beautiful garden, which is surrounded by walls on which is painted figures of 9 vices , such as hatred, envy, avarice, etc. Discourses take place between the ladies and gentles assembled, and at the close Amant appears as an armed Pilgrim, wearing a scarf and bearing on his shoulders the usual burthen, with description of how he succeeded in introducing it through the wicket of the Tower, and “gathers the roses,” upon which he returns thanks to Venus, her son, and the nobles assembled. The work was begun by William de Lorris, about 1282, as the Templars and other Orders are mentioned, and the early use of the word Macon appears in it. It was completed by Jean de Meung, and Geoffrey Chaucer translated it. Meung wrote also, The Treasure or Seven articles of the faith , The Testament, the Codical , on life and Morals, also two poems, entitled, The Remonstrance of Nature to the wandering Alchemist , and The Reply of the Alchemist to Nature. Other Societies would seem to have abandoned art, and confined themselves, like the Dervish sects, to a Mysticism which aimed at “uniting its members to God.” Brother R. F. Gould relates that the famous Dominican John Tauler, who was born in 1290 and died in 1361, established a Fraternity the members of which concealed their place of burial and recognized each other by secret signs. He was followed by Nicholas of Basle, who had four companions, styling themselves “Friends of God, ” in whom they sought to be “wrapped up”; these also had secret signs of recognition. The most noted Alchemist of this century was Nicholas Flamel , a poor scrivener of Paris, who, by the art, became enormously rich. He purchased for 2 florins in 1357 an ancient book bound in brass, which appeared to be written on leaves made from the bark of trees, perhaps the papyrus; it was subscribed by “Abraham the Jew, Prince, Priest, Levite, Astrologer, and 261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Philosopher.” It had thrice 7 leaves, and every seventh leaf was a picture, symbolizing the Great Work. Flamel traveled in search of someone who could aid him in interpreting the contents, and after much loss of time, trouble, and experiments, he succeeded in making gold. According to his own account he bestowed the riches thus acquired in erecting and endowing 10 churches, 3 chapels, and 14 hospitals in Paris alone, and others in two other cities, besides aiding indigent families. He relates how in the Church of the Innocents, Rue St. Denis, Paris, he caused to be erected “Hieroglyphical Couvertures,” of the art of transmutation, under veils of the “Mysteries of our Salvation.” We learn from a recent reprint that the Count de Cabrines told Borel, that the actual book of Abraham the Jew (Author's Note: The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage ) passed into the possession of the celebrated Cardinal Richelieu. In the possession of a German gentleman, to whom we will refer later, there is a copy of an old MS. which claims to be of the year 1374, that mentions the “Fraternitas Rosae Crucis,” and it was in the year 1378 that the beginning of the Fraternity was attributed to Christian Rosenkreutz . Up to this period, there is a lack of the nature of Alchemical Symbolism, but the following is beyond doubt. Borel describes the house erected at Montpelier, about the year 1450 by the celebrated French traveler and financier Jacques Cuer or Coeur. It was named “ La Loge,” and Coeur is represented on the frieze with a “trowel in his hand.” Three porches may there be seen in the form of a furnace; similar to those of Nicholas Flamel. On one there is, on one side, a “sun”all over fleur- de- lis , and on the other, a full “moon” also covered with fleur-de-lis and surrounded by a hedge or crown as it were of thorns, which seem to denote the solar and lunar stone arrived at perfection. On another portal is seen, on one side, a fruit-tree with branches of roses at its foot, and on the tree the arms of Jacques Coeur. On the other is an escutcheon, and within it what would appear to represent the chemic character of the sun. On the third portal, which is in the midst, there is on one side a stag bearing a banner, and having a collar of fleur-de-lis environed with a branch of a tree, to represent Mercury, or the philosophical matter, which at the commencement is volatile and light as in the stag; on the other side is a shield of France supported by two griffins.This symbolism has nothing in common with that of Flamel, who does not profess to have been an Initiate, but one who has acquired some oral information of the first agent of the work, acquired the art by experiments conducted by himself with the aid of his wife; but on the other hand it is much in keeping with that of Abraham the Jew, and therefore argues a great antiquity. 262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" The whole symbolism is so equally Masonic and Alchemical that it would be difficult to say definitely to which Society it belongs; both Societies seem to have a common transmission, the one as a building, the other as a Mystic Fraternity ; the natural inference here, on this evidence, is that Coeur was a member of both Societies and that he combined the symbols. Alchemically the Sun and Moon signify gold and silver; the chemic character of the sun is a point within a circle; the branch of a tree, said to represent Mercury, has nothing to define the species. It may be mentioned here that the Syrian Mysteries of Adonis represented the slain God as changed by Venus into a red rose; and Theodoratus, Bishop of Cyrus in Syria, asserts that the Gnostics deemed “Ros” to be a symbol of the Saviour; the Egyptians considered the rose as a symbol of regeneration and love, and as the Latin word Rosa is derived from Ros, the dew, it has a relation with baptism; hence the rose-tree in Christian symbolism is the image of the regenerated, whilst dew is the symbol of regeneration. In the Crypt of St. Sibald s in Nuremberg, is a double triangle, interlaced with a circle, within which is a rose. Basil Valentine, who flourished at the same time as Jacques Coeur, in his Azoth Philosophorum , has a figure which is thus described: it represents a winged-globe of which is a triangle inside a square, upon which reposes a dragon; on the latter stands a human figure with two heads, and two hands; surrounding the heads, one of which is male and the other female, are the sun, moon; and five stars; the hand on the male side holds a compass, that on the other a square. The symbolism here clearly alludes to the dual sexual nature of all metals. In The Triumphant Chariot of Antimony , it is asserted that the Adept should be capable of building his own furnaces. The most noted of the Alchemists after this date was Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombast of Hohenheim (known as Paracelsus) , who was born in 1493, and died in 1541, and there is a strong suspicion that it was from injuries inflicted by his enemies. Whilst traveling in the East Paracelsus was taken prisoner by the Tartars, who treated him kindly, and the Khan sent him with his son to Constantinople; it is probable that he studied Magic in these regions. He had studied Magnetism and initiated medical treatment for mercury and opium. Franz Hartman , M.D., has revealed the identity of his teaching with the Eastern Adepts of the Secret Doctrine. His philosophy divides man into seven principles of the outer and inner body; (1) the visible body; (2) the mumia, archaeus, or vital force; (3) the sidereal body, which gradually dissolves; (4) the animal 263"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"soul, common to all things; (5) the rational soul; (6) the aluech, or spiritual soul; (7) new olympus, or divine spirit , which must be caught and bound to the other principles if man is to become immortal. He fills the elements with spirits of many kinds, and mentions the Flagae, who act as our guides and familiars and instruct us in the sciences. Paracelsus designates himself “Monarch of Philosophers,”and the Comte de Gabalis , a work of 1675-80 definitely states that he was elected “Monarch” of the Rosicrucian Society. Paracelsus (1493-1541) was a Swiss chemist and physician. As a professor of medicine in Basel, he violently opposed traditional Galenic medicine and emphasized direct observation instead. His nonconformist views and rough behavior led to his expulsion after less than a year. He led an itinerant life, practicing medicine, writing books and studying diseases of miners. Paracelsus believed in an immaterial principle, the \"alchemist,\" that converted food into body substance. Every animal species, he believed, was endowed with its own alchemist, adapted to its needs. Paracelsus introduced chemical thinking into medicine (iatrochemistry) and nutrition.Today, he remains a controversial figure.We will now refer to a few Societies which seem to have been Cabalistic or Speculative rather than Alchemical, but with a tinge of the Sciences. Between the years 1400 to “circa”1790 there existed at Lubeck a Guild called the \"Compass Brothers\" which met twice a year; their badge was a compass and sector suspended from a crowned letter “C, ” over which was a radiated triangular plate; in 1485 they adopted chains composed of these emblems united by eagles tails. About the year 1480 ,a Society was established at Rome under the name of the “Platonic Academy;” it was a revival of the School of Plato, and the Hall in which they met is said to contain Masonic emblems. Another Society, which may have sprung out of it, was the “Brotherhood of the Trowel, ” at Florence. It was composed of eminent architects, sculptors, and painters, and continued until last century. There are some old drawings in Paris which represent its member‘s as, Assistants, and Masters; the latter appear with a trowel in their hands and a hammer in their girdle; to the Laborers are assigned pails, hods of mortar, the windlass, mallet, chisel, and rough ashlar. Their patron was St. Andrew, whose festival was commemorated annually by peculiar ceremonies allied to the old Mysteries, such as the descent into Hades through the jaws of a serpent. The celebrated Inigo Jones, to whom Anderson attributes quarterly meetings on the model of the Italian Schools, may possibly have known 264"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"something of this Society. Pico de Mirandola and Reuchlin gave themselves to the study of Cabalism and Theurgy, as did the Abbe Trithemius who was the friend, instructor, and co-laborer of Cornelius Agrippa. Use was made during this period of a form of the Masonic cipher in 9 chambers, with a Key which being dissected and triply dotted gave 27 letters. Trithemius attributes this to the ancients, and he gives numerous ciphers. Agrippa established in Paris and elsewhere a secret “Theosophical Society” with peculiar Rites of admission, and signs of recognition, and when he was in London in 1510 as the guest of Dean Collet he established a branch in that city. There is a letter of Landulph s to Agrippa introducing a native of Nuremberg who was dwelling at Lyons, and whom he “hopes may be found worthy to become one of the Brotherhood.” Agrippa says, as to Alchemy, that he could tell many things were he not “as one Initiated sworn to secrecy.” Eirenaes Philalethes , whose real name is not certainly known, and who was the author of several Rosicrucian works, 1667-78, terms Agrippa \"Imperator\" of the Order. Agrippa distinctly states that outside operative Alchemy, which is vain and fictitious when practiced literally, there is another to be sought within mans own self in the operation of the internal spirit. There is a possibility that the well-known “Charter of Cologne”may have reference to these Brotherhoods; it professes to be signed in 1535, by the representatives of 19 lodges, assembled at Cologne on the Rhine, and amongst these signatories are those of Coligny and Melancthon; these somewhat doubtful Lodges do not profess in the document to be operative, but to have sprung out of the Masonry dedicated to John, about the year 1440. An American writer attributes to John Bunyan the allegory of Initiation in his \"Pilgrim s Progress; it is not very satisfactory but Bunyan‘s “Solomon‘s Temple Spiritualised” was probably used in the 18th century, for Craft and Arch Lectures. “Rosy Cross. ” There are traces in 1484 of a Rosicrucian Order at Sleswick, in Denmark: “Fraternitatus Rosarii Sleswicii condito, anno, 1484.” Early in the 17th century, there are traces that the King was head of such an order. Again, last century, such an order unconnected with Freemasonry was patronized by the King and seems to have consisted of seven degrees, according to the statement of an aged Danish physician to Colonel W. J. B. M Leod Moore, who connects it with the Arcane Discipline; though its immediate source will be the Order of Rosy Cross; and it will be sometime found that the peculiar aspect of Swedish Masonry is due to this old Danish System. A Society termed “Militia Crucifera 265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Evangelica” held a meeting at Lunenberg in 1571; and one Simon Studion wrote a book in 1604 entitled “Naometria,” or Temple Measuring, or the Temple opened by the key of David, referring mystically to the inner and outer man carried to the temple of the New Jerusalem; the MS. refers to the Rose and Cross, and to the “Militia Crucifera.” A Society called the “Friends of the Cross,” existing in Holland, is said to have joined an operative Lodge of Freemasons before the year 1726, when Count Spork, who had been initiated therein, according to Brother Malczovich, established a Lodge in Austria in that year, and a medal was struck, of which one side represents the New Jerusalem. In the year 1614 appeared anonymously a work entitled the “Fame and Confession of the Rosy Cross. ” It relates the Eastern travels of a certain Christian Rosenkreutz, at the end of the 14th century, who was Initiated at Damascus into the Secret Wisdom of the Arabians, Chaldeans, and Gymnosophists; then after visiting Egypt and Morocco, he returned to Germany, where he established a small fraternity, which was to be continued secretly for 120 years, each brother, before he died, to appoint his successor. At the close of 120 years, that is about 1604, some alterations were made in their temple of the Holy Spirit when his remains were found intact with the book T in his hand. All the paraphernalia and instruments were there necessary to constitute the Order. The work informs us that they had received the Order “From the Arabians. . . . The Eastern countries have been always famous for Magical and Secret Societies.” Here the founder translated the book M (Marginal, “Liber Mundi”) into good Latin. The “Fame” was to be translated into five languages, that even the unlearned might hope to belong to the Fraternity, \"the which should be divided and parted into certain degrees. “They exacted \"vows of silence and secrecy,” and \"though they held out the Rose as a remote prize, they imposed the Cross on those who are entering.\" The mention of a book which contains all that has yet been written in other books is supposed by some writers (perhaps unnecessarily) to refer to the Tarot. Another work, entitled, “The Echo of the Divinely Illuminated Fraternity of the R.C.,” 1615, asks the question whether the Gospel put an end to the secret tradition and answers it thus: “By no means; Christ established a new College of Magic amongst his disciples, and the Greater Mysteries were revealed to St. John and St. Paul.” This, Brother Findel points out, was a claim of the Carpocratian Gnostics . There exists in the library of the University of Leyden an MS. by Michael Maier which sets forth that in 1570 the Society of the old Magical brethren or Wise Men 266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"was revived under the name of the Brethren of the Golden Rosy Cross. The “Fame and Confession” is usually attributed to J. V. Andrea, but Brother Dr. W. Wynn Westcott points out that though the two tracts may have been edited by this author they are apparently of different eras. The Fame shews no evidence of a divided Christianity, but ranks only against Mohammedanism, whilst the Confession is Lutheran and implies a post- reformation date. Andrea is admittedly author of Christian Mythology, Strasburg, 1619; and Ehrenreich Hohenfelder von Aister Haimb , 1623, in which are the following lines, translated by Brother F. F. Schnitger: -- “And if we here below would learn, By compass, needle, square, and plumb. We never must overlook the meet, Where with our God has measured us. ” Andrea employed himself in spreading a Society called “the Christian Fraternity,” no doubt a branch of the older Societies of the Cross, and lists of members are preserved beyond the date of his death in 1654The Universities had their Scholastic oaths, Luther and Fludd mentions them, and they would seem to have had formal Rites, for the latter in his Mosaicall Philosophy , 1659 (p. 31) repudiates any allegiance which I have by a ceremonial rite vowed unto Aristotle in my youth. Michael Maier, who published his Silentia post Clamores , 1617, says, “Like the Pythagoreans and Egyptians the Rosicrucians exact vows of silence and secrecy. Ignorant men have treated the whole as a fiction, but this has arisen from the five years probation to which they subject even well-qualified Novices before they are admitted to the higher Mysteries; within this period they are to learn how to govern their tongues.” Maier published in the same year as this the de Vita Morte et Resurectione of his friend Robert Fludd. There existed at the Hague in 1622 a Rosicrucian Society with branches in Amsterdam, Nuremberg, Hamburg, Danzig, Mantua, Venice, and Erfurt. “The Brothers wore a black silk cord in the top buttonhole,” an MS. of last century says that this cord was given to them after they had promised, under oath, to be strangled with such a cord rather than break the silence imposed upon them. Their other sign is, that when they go into company they all wear a blue ribbon, to which is attached a golden cross with a rose on it, and this they are given on being received into the Society. This they wear round their necks under their coats, so that not much of it is visible; the golden cross hangs down on the left side. The third sign is that on the top of the head they have a shaven place, about the size of a louis d or, as you may see on myself; hence most of them wear a wig in order not to be recognized; they are moreover very 267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"devout and live very quietly. The fourth sign is that on all high festivals, very early at sunrise, they leave their residence by the same door (“i.e.,” the East), and wave a small green flag. When another of them appears at a place where one lives, he goes to this same place, and there they enter into conversation, in order to recognize one another; for at the beginning they do not trust one another. Thus they have a certain \"Greeting,\" among themselves, which is as follows. “The Stranger says to the man he is visiting, Ave frater ! to which the other answers, Rosae et Aureae ! Then the first says , Crucis ! They then, both together, say Benedictus Deus Dominus Noster, qui Nobis dedit signum . Then they have a large document to which the Imperator has affixed the secret seal.” The M.S. from which this is taken is a part of the documents in possession of Mr. Karl Kisewetter, who is a grandson of the last Imperator and who says that the seal which the last Imperator used in office between 1764- 1802 is of brass about the size of a mark. It consisted of a shield within a circle, on which was a cross, at the base of which was a conventional rose with five petals; at the top, bottom, and sides was the letter “C” signifying, Crux Christi Corona Christianorum (the cross of Christ is the Christians Crown). The English leader of the Rosicrucians was Dr. Robert Fludd, a deep student of the Cabala, Astrology, Alchemy, and Magic. He published at Leyden, in 1616, his Rosicrucian Apologia , after a visit that Maier paid to England. In 1629 appeared his Summum Bonum , and Sophia Cum Moria Certamen , in which, in answer to Father Mersenne as to where the Rosicrucians resided, he replies, -- “In the house of God, where Christ is the Cornerstone,” a spiritual work, in which men are the “living stones.” He speaks in 1633 “of the formerly so- called Rosicrucians who are now known as Sapientes, Sophoi, or Wise men,” and impresses on the reader that it is“under the type of an Architect they erect their House of Wisdom.” There was a Mr. Flood who presented a copy of the Masonic MS. Charges to the Masons Company of London, and as Robert Fludd died 8th September 1637, and resided for a long time near Masons Hall he was probably a Mason. Maier (as quoted in Initiation) says that numerous societies of Rosicrucians had arisen by the various interpretations placed upon their ancient symbols and that the Society consisted of an outer and inner circle to which last the most esoteric part was confined, and there is much which would cause us to think that Fludd s Society of the name was the Masonic Masters Fraternity, known as the Harodim, and all 268"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Continental tradition of the High-grades, or Masters grades, support this. Dr. John Dee, John Booker, William Lilly, and Father Backhouse are well- known Occultists, but as Masons we are more interested in two men who were not only given to those pursuits, but were also well-known Masons, Sir Robert Moray, who was made a Mason at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1641; and Elias Ashmole, who was made at Warrington in 1646. It is conjectured that Thomas Vaughan , the author of many Rosicrucian works under the assumed name of Eugenius Philalethes , may have been accepted in 1641, or thereabouts; he was a friend of Ashmole, and the language of some parts of his works corresponds with our Ritual; Moray also patronised him. Elias Ashmole in his Diary makes several mentions of the “Feasts of the Mathematicians and Astrologers,” and under 1653 says that Father Backhouse, when at the point of death, “instructed him in syllables of the matter of the Philosophers Stone. ” In Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum , 1652, he gives from the “Breviary of Philosophy,” the Oath of the Alchemists, which Society he says was divided into Sons, and Fathers: Will you with me to-morrow be content, Faithfully to receive the Blessed Sacrament, Upon the Oath that I ball here you give, For ne gold, ne silver, so long as you live; Neither for love you beare towards your kinne, Nor yet to no great man, preferment to wynne, That you disclose the secret I shall you teach, Neither by writing, nor by swift speech,But only to him, which you be sure, Hath ever searched after the secrets of nature, To him you may reveal the secrets of this art, Under the cover of Philosophie, before the world, you depart. The symbolic tracing of the Rosicrucians was a Square Temple approached by seven steps, of which the four first represented the four elements, and the remaining three salt, sulphur, and mercury, the three great principles; here also we find the two Pillars of Hermes, the five- pointed star, sun and moon, compasses, square, and triangle. Now you have probably more knowledge of the Rosicrucians origins and their teachings than most of its pseudo adepts of today. 269"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" Chapter Six The Illuminati’s darkest secrets A Communist Pope During Pope Francis’ address to the joint session of US Congress, in September 2015, four names were given by the Pontiff as examples of honorable American people. The first two are well-known, Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr, but most people aren’t familiar with the other two, Thomas Merton and Dorothy Day. Most would be shocked at the real truth behind this subtle stunt by the Jesuit Pope to promote his Marxist agenda. Basically Pope Francis is attempting, what the Soviet Union could not manage to pull off in the past, and that’s to forcibly convert the US to Communist ideology. The United States’ largest lay-run apostolates called, Catholic Answers, whose mission statement is to “help good Catholics become better Catholics,” describes Thomas Merton (1915–1968), as a womanizer, and member of the Young Communist League. Thomas Merton also fathered a child, (he was a Trappist monk, but some people also describe as a Zen Buddhist. In the last year of his life, he wrote in his journal while traveling through Asia: Last night I dreamed I was, temporarily, back at Gethsemani. I was dressed in a Buddhist monk’s habit, but with more black and red and gold, a \"Zen habit,\" in color more Tibetan than Zen . . . I met some women in the corridor, visitors and students of Asian religion, to whom I was explaining I was a kind of Zen monk and Gelugpa together when I woke up. (Asian Journal, p. 107) Let me remind you that Merton is supposed to be a Catholic monk, not a Zen Buddist, but Pope Francis believes that we should all honor that added value in his One World Religion set up. In fact, he did not mention Jesus once in his speech to Congress, but he mentioned Moses, who is recognized as Prophet by all three Abrahamic religions. Pope Francis’ other choice, Dorothy Day, does not seem to be any better. 270"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"David Ripe for the Catholic Media Coalition wrote this about Dorothy Day in 2012, when the American bishops unanimously backed the advancement of the cause of Dorothy Day, through the process leading to sainthood: While she has the unanimous support of the bishops, Day is a controversial figure among many rank and file Catholics who do not consider her an acceptable role model. For them, she exemplifies the archetypal “liberal Catholic” or “social justice Catholic.” These terms refer to individuals who are often disposed to try to change the Church in various ways and who are strongly animated and influenced by left- leaning political ideology. Many such Catholics became emboldened following Vatican II, and made chimerical interpretations of its documents. Chief among the objections to Day’s nomination for sainthood is the belief that she embraced the doctrines of Marxism and made them the framework of her social activism. David Ripe added, citing the well documented research of other sources that clearly demonstrates how traditional Catholics, the same ones who are now beginning to oppose Pope Francis in growing numbers, perceive Dorothy Day: Carol Byrne, a British researcher, has investigated Day’s life extensively and has chronicled her activities and writings, along with those of Peter Maurin, in The Catholic Worker Movement, 1933-1980: A Critical Analysis (AuthorHouse UK Ltd.). While Day’s defenders insist that she fully disavowed Marxism after her conversion to Catholicism, Byrne’s research leads her to conclude otherwise. So having analyzed who Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton really are, could the Church be close to another schism? In Rome today, as I am writing this, it appears to be a growing concern among many traditional Catholics that don’t accept a Church full of compromises and hypocrisy, like the Church now proposed by Pope Francis. Even CNN religion editor Daniel Burke wrote that: Abortion and same-sex marriage received scant mention in the Pope's short address. Instead, Francis -- the first pontiff to address Congress and the first from Latin America -- focused on immigration, the death penalty, racial injustice, the weapons trade, and poverty . Are we going to listen to the Pope, and limit our gun rights, or discuss the death penalty, when the growing immigration and the refugee crisis will most likely escalate crime?

Instead, he went on with his criminal plan to convince all of Europe supported by Continental Freemasonry and the left-wing mondialist side of US politics, (ie Obama, Clinton, Elizabeth Warren aka \"Pocahontas\") to give up their rights to the millions of incoming refugees and immigrants, and to force the US to give up their just right to carry guns and defend themselves from this emerging chaos. FIG 28 – A press release in support of the refugees made by the main Obediences of Continental Freemasonry (dated 7th of September 2016) The Holy See delegation to the United Nations has issued a Position Statement on the Outcome document of the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, “Transforming Our 272"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The Statement states the agenda is a “clear sign” that the international community has come together to eradicate poverty, and will work to ensure that all people will have the conditions necessary to live in freedom and dignity. Really? On the morning of the 25th of September 2015 at 8:30 am ET, Fox News blatantly admitted that “Pope Francis would be giving his marching orders to the UN,” We must oppose this whole charade before we all lose our rights and our freedom. Stand up before it’s too late, now is the time and let me remind my readers of the words written by the late reverend Richard Wurmbrand: Today much of the world is still Marxist. Marxism in one form or another is embraced by many in capitalist countries, too. There are even Christians, and amazingly, clergymen, some in high standing, who are sure that while Jesus might have had the right answers about how to get to heaven, Marx had the right answers about how to help the hungry, destitute, and oppressed here on earth.Marx, it is said, was deeply humane. He was dominated by one idea: how to help the exploited masses. What impoverishes them, he maintained, is capitalism. Once this rotten system is overthrown after a transitional period of dictatorship of the proletariat, a society will emerge in which everyone will work according to his abilities in factories and farms belonging to the collective, and will be rewarded according to his needs. There will be no state to rule over the individual, no wars, no revolution, only an everlasting, universal brotherhood. In order for the masses to achieve happiness, more is needed than the overthrow of capitalism. Marx writes: The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of man is a requisite for their real happiness. The call to abandon their illusions about their conditions is a call to abandon a condition which requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, the criticism of this vale of tears of which religion is the halo. Allegedly, Marx was antireligious because religion obstructs the fulfillment of the Communist ideal, which he considered the only answer to the world's problems. This is how Marxists explain their position, and sadly there are clergymen who explain it in the same way. [67] Well, I wonder what Wurmbrand’s opinion of a Marxist Jesuit Pope, like Bergoglio, would have been, and even Ed Stourton from the BBC News 273"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"magazine questioned a couple of years ago if the Pope was indeed a Communist, writing that: Pope Francis's critique of free-market economics has made him an icon for the Left and prompted claims that he is a Communist. The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics has called capitalism a source of inequality at best - and at worst a killer. Is the Pope, as his critics claim, a red radical? In the meantime, the scale of sex abuse at the hands of UN workers is growing day by day just like in the Vatican, and the shocking fact is that pedophiles target aid organizations, just like the Catholic priests target poor children. The scale of sex abuse at the hands of UN workers is huge, so why should they decide anything about our future? The UN's Emergency Coordination Center said in an interview with the British tabloid The Sun in February 2018, that an estimated 60,000 cases of sexual exploitation were commited over the last decade by 3,300 pedophiles working in the organization. Both the UN’s are corrupt institutions of the Pedo-Elite controlling the New World Order that should be shut down and prosecuted for their crimes. Pedophilia and the Satanic left-wing connection In 2017, the exposure of serial sexual predator and Hollywood Democrat kingpin Harvey Weinstein raises even more questions on the true nature of the link between pedophilia and the left wing. In the past, Bill Clinton offered a get-out-of-jail-free card to a whole army of criminals, from Weinstein to Jeffrey Epstein. In the US, the close relationship between the pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, and Jesuit-trained Bill Clinton, who once praised his “insights and generosity”, were detailed not so long ago, 274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"in a revealing book by James Patterson. In Italy, the Jesuit agent and leader of the ruling Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, is linked to one of the countries most dangerous pedophiles, his old friend, Rodolfo Fiesoli, an influential and dark figure in the international pedophile network connected to the US Democrats and the Vatican. On November 12, 2011, a few weeks before Rodolfo Fiesoli was arrested once again for the crime of pedophilia, (his first arrest was back in 1985), he spoke at the famous Salone dei Cinquecento in Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, in the presence of none other than Mr. Renzi, during a conference for TedX, a liberal-minded foundation that is mainly inspired by the ideals of Al Gore. TEDx was created in the spirit of TED’s mission, “ideas worth spreading.” It currently supports independent organizers who are usually linked to left-wing ideology and want to create a TED-like event in their own community. So Rodolfo Fiesoli condemned in 1985, 2000 and 2015 for pedophilia, participated as a supposed “educator”, despite being condemned several times since the mid 80’s, for the crime of sexual abuse to minors, at his community, called Forteto di Vicchio near Florence. This institution established back in 1977, was born to support his bizare theories on family, and the recovery of minors in distress, something the Jesuits seem to appreciate very much and support. In the audience was the then Mayor of Florence Matteo Renzi, who was smiling during Fiesoli’s speech, nodding his head several times and clapping to show his approval. After the arrest of Fiesoli, references to this pedophile monster connected to Renzi, and the US Democratic Party, disappear from the online site of the initiative, and from YouTube, but fortunately, we still have surviving footage of the event. In 2015, Fiesoli is finally condemned to 17 years after his latest pedophilia trial, but of course with his friend Matteo Renzi in power, back then as prime minister of Italy, he has not spent one day in prison. This whole story demonstrates once again not only the open support of the pedophile network made by the liberal establishment in Italy, as in the US, but also shows their dangerous untouchability. How is this possible? Linda Blood a former cult member, that belonged in the past to U.S. Army Lt. Col. Michael Aquino’s Temple of Set, writes something that partly answers my question: Many investigators now charge that this sexual abuse and exploitation of children is being perpetrated by underground cults of sadistic pedophiles 275"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"and producers of child pornography linked by a belief system that incorporates a form of Satanism. They suspect that the ritualized abuse is often employed as a conditioning tool. Most of these cults are said to be intergenerational, and all are extremely secretive. According to law enforcement officials, in addition to child and adult prostitution and pornography, they are involved in drug and arms trafficking and serious forms of white collar crime such as computer scams and insurance fraud. One of the main purposes of this vicious form of child abuse appears to be the traumatizing and subsequent control of the minds of the children, cowing them into submission and, ultimately, producing a new generation of abusers and victims. People alleged to be adult survivors of such abuse during childhood have come forward by the hundreds to tell their stories. These disclosures have ignited a controversy over the validity of such memories that has polarized broad segments of the psychiatric, academic, and law enforcement communities. It is true that many of these cases involve seemingly fantastic elements, such as allegations of ritual murders that have gone undetected and unsolved. However, the bulk of the accusations deal with torture, mutilation, child sexual abuse, sadomasochism, animal sacrifice, and cannibalism— ugly, sadistic, and grotesque crimes of sex and violence that, while indeed deserving of the adjective weird, have been committed many times over the course of human history. Some of these crimes are known to be an integral part of the worldwide subcultures of sexual sadomasochism and exploitation, including the multibillion-dollar international child prostitution and pornography industry. However, we also find in her shocking book, entitled The New Satanis t from 1994, a very interesting connection between the infamous Michael Aquino, whose speciality was psychological warfare, and was responsible for the acceptance of Satanism in the US Military, as a valid religious option, and the usual Jesuits and the Catholic Church, who are always interested in children: The temple membership turned out to consist of an odd combination of the respectable and the marginal of society. There were teachers, law enforcement and military officers, nurses, bank tellers, and secretaries, alongside former prostitutes of both sexes and the odd ex-biker or two. There were two former Jesuits. One member turned out to be the principal of a Catholic school! She and her husband, a priest of the cult, had adopted several children. 276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Interesting revelation to say the least, because it confirms once again the links between the Jesuits and Left-Wing liberal Satanists like Aquino, who was suspected of operating child pedo rings in and around military bases. Aquino was never charged, in spite of many accusations. One army base was closed down after it was discovered that 60 children were sexually abused there. Regarding the Jesuits and their interest in children and Communism, I recently received a very interesting book by Giovanni Augustino “Johnny” Cirucci, suggested by a common friend, Sean Stone; that seems to summarize the matter perfectly: Spurred by the property-sharing philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Jesuits created the first communist villages across South America. Known as Reduccións in Spanish or Reduções in Portuguese these “Reductions” served several purposes: • Maintain a strategic presence for Spain or Portugal without the overt appearance of armed soldiers. • “Convert” natives to become Catholic citizens of their imperial conquerors. • Enrich the elites of Spain, Portugal, and Rome with slave labor that cost little to maintain...unless you were a slave. Containing undesirables from Indian reservations to Nazi concentration camps to Soviet gulags to Franklin Roosevelt’s Japanese/American internment, all have the common ancestor of Jesuit “reductions” in South America. ...Before the days of Avtomat Kalashnikov rifles and Schmeisser submachine guns, large groups of prisoners were hard to handle with just a few Jesuit priests. The Company needed to use brains over brawn. Later, they would be able to appropriate the “brawn” of whole nations. The appeal of wealth redistribution is that recipients can live a somewhat easier life, though it is a utopia that has always disappointed. In South America, “social justice” would become the cry for taking from “the rich” and giving to “the poor”. What usually happens, however, is that the super-rich exploits the poor to bleed the few real producers in the Middle Class. If this seems like the perfect weapon to be used in the Counter- Reformation, it’s not by coincidence. The phrase “social justice” was coined by the Jesuit theologian and mentor to Pope Leo XIII, Father Luigi Taparelli D’Azeglio. ... The utility of Communism was immediately seized upon by the Vatican. ... 277"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The Jesuits took their experiences with the South American reducciones and fed them to a German Jewish aristocrat who had never held a “proletariat” working-class job in his life — Karl Heinrich Marx. 1618: Home Children Scandal — “vagrant” children rounded up in England and sent to Canada, America, Australia as slave labor against their will. The process was used by the Catholic Church, first behind “secular” and “Protestant” fronts, then directly, for predation. Because the governments of several nations were involved in the child slave trade (and still are), “official histories” are whitewashes, at best. Yet, even the Australian government must admit that “child migration” has been “chequered”, to put it lightly. Child migration had a long and chequered history surrounded by controversy and marred by scandal. It was, actually, never a single policy pursued continuously: rather it was a complex tangle of competing private schemes, government initiatives, charismatic personalities, muddled priorities and confused agendas. It was critically affected by the economic, political and social pressures of particular times.” [68] Modern Satanism, Communism and confidentiality For decades mainstream media outlets have been hesitant to report crimes which involve Satanism. When such incidents do receive coverage, the belief system of the perpetrators are hardly touched upon and tend to never be followed up with further investigation. In any discussion of contemporary Satanism, the figure of Aleister Crowley (1875- 1947) is like a mafia Godfather over a shadowy underworld, wrote the late William H. Kennedy, who also added that Crowley (rhymes with “holy”) is the single most influential character in the formation of modern Satanism and Witchcraft (Wicca). During his own quest for spiritual enlightenment, Crowley was also pushing the demonic agenda like no one else before him. As I wrote elsewhere in this book, this perverse and evil figure is central, to understand and learn more of the present decline of the Western Initiatic System, and the growing threat of Satanism and black magic in our daily lives. Crowley used drugs with meditative practices, and made obscure sex rituals popular, to form his own system of sex-magick, that would define the New Age and its many cults operating today in the secretive world of 278"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"the Illuminati. At times, Crowley identified himself as Satan (and at other times ancient Egyptian deities) and likewise encouraged his disciples to venerate him as Baphomet. Probably Crowley chose the pharaonic gods for rituals merely because a statue of Horus at the Cairo Museum had the catalog number of 666, and he saw this as a sign from Lucifer, and his new religion of Thelema. “Crowleyanity” is an inversion of “Christianity.” He symbolically inverted the Divine order by replacing Christ with himself and had his even more deranged followers venerate him as the Messiah Something the dark side of the Illuminati network still does to this day. In his bid for spiritual power, Crowley directly petitioned the Fallen Angel by praying and killing small birds before a human skeleton mounted on a makeshift altar in his home. Crowley also claimed to have summoned Beelzebub and a host of 49 demons, and, on another occasion, he claimed to have conjured up 316 Devils in an arcane ceremony. Whatever one makes of these assertions, it certainly demonstrates Crowley’s allegiance to the Prince of this World and not Christianity. Crowley later believed he was also “The Great Beast 666” . In his most famous channeled work, The Book of the Law , written at a time when Crowley was openly referring to himself as, The Great Beast 666, he wrote many other bestiliaties, “ With my hawk’s head I peck at the eyes of Jesus.” It this book, that has become a sort of Satanic Old Testament, if we view Lavey’s Satanic Bible as the New Testament of Satanism, Crowley penned his new credo “ Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” The book in question called for a New Age of global conflict, constant bloodshed, and the eventual destruction of Christianity in an apocalyptic battle. In his obsession that is also the obsession of the Occult elite, to overturn Christendom, Crowley was even willing to adopt atheism and Communism. Let’s remember that the word occult comes from the Latin word occultus meaning hidden, and there are way too many hidden links between Communism and Satanism working hand in hand to destroy the Western Initiatic world. Just after World War I, Crowley, who went to Russia only a few years earlier, wrote to the newly installed Communist government in Moscow, and offered his services as propaganda minister for atheism, with the express intent of deriding Christianity. Can you believe it? Crowley, who performed at the Russian Court with his troop of 279"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"seven (ragged) Rag-Time girls, only 4 years earlier, now wanted to be the minister of atheism in Lenin’s Russia. The fact that the Russian Reds had officially no metaphysical beliefs, was of little concern to The Beast 666, who obviously knew about the secret occult links of the Russian Communist, as Crowley definitely believed there were secret powers behind the Communist Party. It was the Communist Central Committee’s Satanic vow to destroy Christianity that really grabbed Crowley’s attention. [69] However, The Beast was only concerned with the obliteration of the Christian Faith and would use anyone or any system at his disposal to promote this agenda, that confirm once more his totally Satanic nature. But the Communists must have believed that “The Beast 666” would better serve their revolution if he remained in the West, as he never received a reply, but today the US Ordo Templi Orientis (Caliphate), is very active in Moscow and the rest of the Russian Federation. The Russian O.T.O. even published a limited edition of The Book of the Law translated for the first time in the Russian language. From my personal experience, many of the Russian members of the O.T.O, are also Intelligence assets, often operating as dangerous double agents, officially working for the FSB, but in reality, serving George Soros in trying to destabilize countries like Ukraine. Basically, traitors of their own nation, that constantly work to sabotage, and oppose Vladimir Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church, with little or no success, on behalf of the New World Order. However, until now, their confidentiality standards have protected them from being persecuted in the Russian Federation, as well as in other countries like France, where they are blacklisted by local authorities. 280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" Chapter Seven Atheism and Materialism The Illuminati root of evil There is a book mentioned in some original writings of the Order of the Illuminati in 1787, on p. 118, as a treatise on atheism and materialism . It is entitled, Better than Horus, or the seven hows and whys. The author is believed to be Christian Ernst Wünsch , a professor .of physics and mathematics in Frankfurt, though John Robison falsely gives credit to Bahrdt. Wünsch, who wrote a piece in 1783 entitled, Horus or the Astro- Gnostic final judgment on the Revelation of John, under the name of Ebenezer. He published nothing in 1784, giving him the opportunity to write this piece, and in 1785 anonymously co-authored a book entitled Horus remarks about the prophet Jesus and his disciples with Aloys Sandbichler, and anonymously published still another piece on Horus called, The mysteries of Ceres of Eleusis: Defense against the sarcasm of the author of Horus, and the final purpose of their foundation compared with the final purpose of the Foundation of Freemason Societies. In 1789, he again anonymously published a work called Rabinicalism or a collection of Talmudic follies, in a series of letters from the author of Horus. Titles of other self-proclaimed works include Cosmological entertainment for young friends of nature in 1791, Lucifer or addendum to the existing studies of the atmosphere in 1802, and Esoterica or serious views of the relations of man to God in 1817. In Wünsch’s old age he confessed to writing the pieces on and by Horus, though not any piece specifically. He attributed the work to youthful 281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"idealism. It is particularly important to note that in addition to his academic and Masonic pedigree, Wünsch’s works are mentioned by Richard Dülmen and René Le Forestier, as being suggested readings for the Illuminati due to their libertine nature. Professor Christian Ernst Wünsch, who is said to be a member of Weishaupt’s Illuminati Order wrote: \"Horus of the Egyptians was the messiah of the Jews, as we have often shown. Horus was the bread and wine. The Messiah was thus also, in the opinion of some in the Jewish sect, to present. He put forth namely life’s bread and life’s wine, that is, he was the soul's food and the soul's drink, heavenly food and heavenly drink. Jesus had to do all of this. He had further said, that he was going to come in a different relation to situations with his disciples, that he would now like to succeed in his designs on the temple. For this reason, he metaphorically gave them bread and wine, instead of eating his body and blood, as a memorial to his custom until this time, and to drink a toast with them, and since then the communion has been used.\" Aleister Crowley taught that in 1904, the world entered the Aeon of Horus, also called the Aeon of the Child or the New Aeon. Most Thelemites, and even Crowley himself at times view the current two-thousand year period as a time of liberation, freedom, and self-actualization—almost synonymous with the Age of Aquarius. But some of Crowley’s writings indicate a less favorable opinion of the Aeon of Horus. In the introduction to The Book of the Law, Crowley describes the New Aeon as a time of infantile people and infantile ideas. “We are all children,” he declares. The third chapter of Liber AL vel Legis describes the characteristics of the Aeon of Horus. “Superficially ,” Crowley says, “they appear appalling.” Usually, people are appalled at the violence and lack of compassion described in Chapter III. But in this essay , Crowley speaks of the utter childishness and depravity of the New Aeon. One could call it almost a Dark Age. The primary characteristic of the Aeon of Horus is “the recognition of the individual as the unit of society.” This has already occurred in Europe, America, Canada, and Australia, where nearly all Westerners think of themselves as individuals first, and have no strong allegiance to nation, tribe, ethnicity, family, or other community. As immigration continues, non-Westerners are starting to 282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"think of themselves as individuals rather than members of tribes. And as initiatives topple, traditional societies around the world continue, replacing them with democracy and capitalism. More and more people around the world are shedding their tribal and familial loyalties, instead of recognizing the individual as the unit of society. Everywhere today we see the reign of Horus taking root. Some examples Crowley gives in his essay, call out the childish aspect of the New Aeon: the growth of innocence and irresponsibility the “childlike confidence in progress” “infantile cults” like Communism, Fascism, Pacifism, Health Crazes, and Occultism religions “sentimentalized to the point of practical extinction” the popularity of methods for “soothing fractious infants,” such as the cinema, football pools, and guessing competitions sport and “the babyish enthusiasms and rages which it excites, whole nations disturbed by disputes between boys” we are all treated as imbecile children—there is censorship and “they won’t trust us to cross the roads at will” The Aeon of the Child is not an end, however. As Crowley says, “the Child will grow up.” In the section “The Next Step,” Crowley describes the dangers of Fascism, Communism, and Democracy —all which suppress the individual. The one who lives by the rule of Thelema and doesn’t follow the herd will have difficulties, but will not fail: Evolution makes its changes by anti-Socialistic ways. The “abnormal” man who foresees the trend of the times and adapts circumstance intelligently, is laughed at, persecuted, often destroyed by the herd; but he and his heirs, when the crisis comes, are survivors. [70] Jeremy James writes: “The prophetic End-Time scenario set out in the Book of Revelation is unavoidable (and it is), then we should expect to see certain unmistakable signs that the world is advancing in that direction. Indeed, we should be able to infer specific elements of Satan’s Plan, as they relate to the End-Time, from the events described in the Book of Revelation. It is a sad fact that very few Christians today are taking 283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"seriously the profile of Satan that is presented for our benefit in the Word of God. If they did they would realize that Satan must have a plan – a very detailed and highly sophisticated plan – if he is to have any chance of achieving his vaunting ambitions. He wants to control the world openly, not just covertly, as he does at present, and to be worshipped in place of God by all humanity (See Isaiah 14:12-14). To do this he must undermine and destroy true Biblical Christianity. He must also destroy the Jewish people in their entirety. This is because Jesus stated that he will return only when the Jews, as a nation, call upon him in a spirit of true supplication and repentance – “For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed, is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.” (Matthew 23:39).” We know from the Book of Revelation, that Satan’s Plan must address the three main areas of human endeavor – religious, economic, and political . I will focus mainly on the religious aspect since it is the one that is least understood. A strategy aimed at world domination very clearly requires an integrated system of global government and a centrally controlled economic regime. However, the essential features of an all-inclusive system of religion- a one world religion, not to mention the steps that are needed to bring it about, are not harder to envision, if you follow the decline of the Western Initiatic System and the rise of Satanism, thanks to the atheism envisioned by Freemasons with a distorted vision of the Craft and religion, like Professor Christian Ernst Wünsch who wrote: Why did religion since Adam, the mosaic of Solomon, the Christian and Patristic, alone in the smallest part of the people, change so often, being remolded and reformed? If God is unchangeable, why should they be changeable, if they came from him? Why again do not the Testaments, the church fathers, and the Bible editions speak alone, and almost all are commentators of the other? What is eternal, true, unchanging, holy, and generally should not be changed continuously? A critical view of the Bible and Christianity is evident in his writing: If the unmarried state is the most perfect, as the Christian religion teaches, then obviously this religion also aims to reduce the human race. If the recommendation of the clergy would take effect, the human race within sixty or seventy years would die out. Can this be God's regulation? How can one believe, that God determined us to do what is against 284"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"nature? To be a perfect Christian, one must take his reason captive, blindly believe the entire people’s poem, renounce pleasure, fast, be abstinent, be unmarried, and renounce one’s parents and fortune, to act in a word, contrary to nature. What worse could probably be demanded by the fiercest tyrant, and whose contradictions can be found everywhere? “The fate of mankind, as well as of religion, depends upon the emergence of a new faith in the future,” wrote Father Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ, New Age theologian and Jesuit priest, quoted in Al Gore’s Earth in the Balance – Ecology and the Human Spirit from 1992. That’s why people like —David Spangler, Director of UN Planetary Initiative, and one of the founding fathers of the New Age movement, made this shocking statement once: Fundamental Bible-believing people do not have the right to indoctrinate their children in their religious beliefs because we, the state, are preparing them for the year 2000, when America will be part of a one- world global society and their children will not fit in. That is also why they hate Trump and all Christians because you can’t have a New World Order and a One-World Government without an NWO One-World Religion to help keep the diverse peoples of the earth under control. And the architects of the New World Order, and their Jesuit supervisors have been simultaneously working on both, for a long time. The One-World Government and the One-World Religion is a reality, and no longer a conspiracy theory, and a true threat to our religious identity. The One-World Religion alluded to in Revelation, is coming down the backstretch, also thanks to the New Age phenomena, and its arrival is faster than anyone could have guessed just a few years ago, especially with a Jesuit Pope promoting it. Don’t be fooled by the oftentimes harmless-looking exteriors of the New Age phenomena, and never dabble or explore these Satanic webs of enslavement. Hold fast to the safety and victory of the Christian faith! Bible prophecy warns : “For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. Behold, I have told you in advance” (Matt. 24:24, 25). Due to its deep and inextricable involvements in Scripturally forbidden practices —like divination, witchcraft, sorcery, mediumship, spiritism, and numerous others —the New Age opens the gates for the adversary and his demonic legions to unleash an end-times Pandora's box of unrighteousness. In effect, the movement acts as a rapidly enlarging 285"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"breeding ground for the seeding, propagation, and unleashing of a plaque of the spirit. The massive releasing of ghouls and demons in the movies, Ghostbusters, and Poltergeist, the New Age acts in a very similar way in opening the gateways for Satan's demons. Dave Hunt, in his excellent book, America: The Sorcerer's Apprentice , comments on this theme: “Today's world confronts a strange and growing paradox that could very well mark a pivotal point in human history. Even as the scientific and technological advancement which ushered in the space age is accelerating at an exponential rate, we are witnessing far and away the greatest occult explosion of all time.” One thing is certain: “the winds spreading the seeds of sorcery have reached gale proportions.” The words of a leading New Age spokesman, Marilyn Ferguson, author of the landmark New Age manifesto, The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980's , speak to the magnitude of the forces in motion: “Broader than reform, deeper than revolution, this benign conspiracy for a new human agenda has triggered the most rapid cultural realignment in history. This great shuddering, irrevocable shift overtaking us is not a new political, religious, philosophical system. It is a new mind —the ascendence of a startling worldview.” Further elaborating on the magnitude of this “benign conspiracy,” Ferguson's book states: “This network —the Aquarian Conspiracy —has already enlisted the minds, hearts, and resources of some of our most advanced thinkers, including Nobel laureate scientists, philosophers, statesmen, celebrities, and steadily growing numbers from every corner of American society.”... [the] network is working to create a different kind of society based on a vastly enlarged concept of human potential [and] ... shows us how the technologies for expanding and transforming personal consciousness, once the secret of an elite, are now generating massive change in every cultural institution — medicine, politics, business, education, religions, and the family. “Will our present turmoil lead to a worldwide breakdown of society — or to a breakthrough to the next step of human evolution? The answer may depend in large measure on the influence of the Aquarian Conspiracy.”The roots of the Movement go deep, much deeper than they would appear at first glance. In a tempestuous world and a society filled with millions of restless people thirsting for answers and spiritual fulfillment, it offers a huge array of tempting alternatives to the Christian faith —\"the faith once for all delivered to the saints.\" The New Age offers multitudes of age-old, occult-based temptations re-packaged in the glossy modernized guise of a new, improved New Age.The influences of this phenomenon are much 286"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"more pervasive in our society than it might appear on the surface. [71] Early in the 1980’s the New Age Movement emerged from its secluded circles and began to vigorously propagate its ideology around the world. It is closely associated with the concept of a New World Order and forms part of it. The movement and its doctrine are by now well-known, and the media often refers to it. Newspaper and magazine headings such as the following no longer sound strange to the person in the street: · Welcome to the Global Village · The World Teacher is nowhere · The Age of Aquarius has dawned · Anything is permissible if everything is God · Tutu decries break up of New Age prayer meetings · Soul of a New Age The movement endeavors to raise the consciousness level of humanity, to unlock mystical powers in people, to unite the world religiously, politically, economically, and socially, and to pave the way for the appearance of a single world leader. He will be the common messiah of all faiths. Not only in the field of religion, but in all other areas, he will establish the concept of planetary citizenship. In the process, all boundaries and divisions will be removed for the sake of greater unity. [72] This will be the One World Religion of the Antichrist. Christian Ethics Impeached, Jesus accused of being the True Prince of Evil !?! You can be a believer or a non-believer, but the Gospels are very clear in the fact that we are to understand the tactics of the devil, and not stick our heads in the sand and act as if he doesn’t matter like the majority of the population does on a daily basis. That is why many people, prefer to ignore this reality, this “Tribulation”, in favor of a life of lies and compromises. The Bible asks us to be aware of Satan’s activities for our own protection: Be alert and of sober mind . Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. (1 287"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Peter 5:8 New International Version). This is very important. The enemy is constantly on the move. He is roaming the earth looking for victims using his own Satanic Network of lies and deceit to push his evil plan for the global enslavement of humanity. In the book of Job, Satan stands before God, and when God asks him where he came from, Satan replies... From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it. (Job 1:7 NIV). It seems that Satan is restless and cannot stand still. He knows that he only has a limited time before his destruction, and must work as quickly as possible before the new millennium will finally see the arrival of the Kingdom of God on Earth. Imagine the anxiety he must face knowing he and his so-called “Legion”, are about to be defeated. He is consumed by hatred, he wants to harm as many as possible, but he knows that his time is short and is doomed to destruction. So, he must work frantically to accomplish evil, yet he is limited in his abilities. He is a restless, angry, anxiety-ridden just as his well-known servant Hillary Clinton. So let’s try to have an insight into his nature, his character, and his abilities, to better understand and be able to fight our enemy whether or not you believe in the actual figure of Satan, as most Satanist these days don’t even believe in him. Lucien Greaves of The Satanic Temple is one of Satan’s most loyal servants, and he says he does not believe in a supernatural Satan. Mr. Greaves is clear that the Satanic Temple does not worship Satan at all: “Definitely not,” he told the Associated Press. Having said this, Greaves’ new version of Satanism seems even more demented, and full of contradiction, than his Satanic predecessor, Anton La Vey, ever was. Because, believe it or not, Greaves is the public face of Satanism in the United States today. Shane Bugbee posted an interview on Vice.com with Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves entitled “ Unmasking Lucien Greaves, Leader of the Satanic Temple,” published on July 30th, 2013 AD. Bugbee is an old friend and collaborator of Greaves: He was a young man, too smart for his own good. He wanted a copy of a book I had republished called Might Is Right. It was a 100-year-old tome, long forgotten by most, with the exception of Anton LaVey, who'd found it in a bookstore as a young man and used it as the basis for The Satanic Bible. I asked Anton to write an introduction, and he jumped at the opportunity to introduce the book to the world again. By way of thanks, Anton invited me to his home and made me a high priest in the Church of Satan. He also allowed my wife and I to conduct the final interview with him just months before his death in 1996. The release of this new version 288"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"of Might Is Right became a phenomenon within the underground, and that is what brought the future leader of the Satanic Temple to my door. Only his name wasn't Lucien Greaves at the time, it was Doug Mesner. (This isn’t the first time Doug has been connected with the Temple, though it is the first time he has publicly admitted his involvement.) When he first came to my home, Doug brought a stack of his drawings and writings with him. It was amazing stuff, and much to my surprise he left it with me. Not long after our first meeting, and after reviewing his sketchbooks at length, I reprinted a limited edition version of Might Is Right and asked Doug to illustrate the chapter headings for it. His work on the book was truly excellent . [73] So Bugbee and Mesner/Greaves met because the latter, “wanted a copy of a book I had republished called Might Is Right ”, a book by Ragnar Redbeard pseudonym used by Arthur Desmond (1859 – 1929) , a British- born politician, proto-fascist, poet and author, who used a fairly common Norwegian name for his pseudonym; which means powerful, influential or judgmental, so it fits with the tone of the text. Christian apologetics Project, a ministry dedicated to the defense of the biblical Christian worldview, recently wrote a brilliant analysis of the book in question, and its true influence on the Satanic Temple: Ever since Oklahoma City, where a monument was dedicated to the Ten Commandments and then challenged by the Satanic Temple and its donation to erect a monument dedicated to the devil, the Satanic Temple group has continued to seek opportunities where its message would be heard. Most recently, that opportunity has now extended to the elementary classroom, where the group, under the guidance of Lucien Greaves, seeks to infuse American youth with more of its “philosophy,” which is not so much inspired by the devil, per sé, as it is by a text unread by most, that vilifies and mocks Judeo-Christianity. In fact, according to Greaves himself, “I have helped develop us into something we all do truly believe in and wholeheartedly embrace: an atheistic philosophical framework that views ‘Satan’ as a metaphorical construct by which we contextualize our works.” In other words, The Satanic Temple is not about Satanism at all. It is about the promotion of atheism, as Greaves redefines the words Satan and Satanism in ways to mock the biblical description of Satan. Greaves and The Satanic Temple admit that they get their inspiration from a book entitled Might is Right, which interestingly cites a pseudonym as well for its author: Ragnar Redbeard. The book was first published in 1896 and attempts to one-up Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince by not only 289"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"condemning Jews, Christians, and Jesus Christ, but by arguing that in order to get anywhere in life, all claims to authority and rule are to be rejected and only those who exercise brute force to exterminate their enemies will find peace, contentment, and success . [74] However, Mesner/Greaves explained in 2015 to Breitbart : “Might Is Right is a racist book and an anti-Semitic book. LaVey renounced the racialism and anti-Semitism, but he felt that people should be stratified, that we should work toward a meritocracy where the more intelligent, talented and productive people are best able to rise above. On that pretext, he really renounced the idea of equality. People are born with distinct talents.” Greaves continues to say to Breitbart that earlier in his life, that type of mindset made sense to him, and he gravitated toward LaVeyan Satanism because it seemed to be the brutal reality of the world. As he got older, however, his mindset began to change. Or, as he put it: “I grew up.” “I thought about the nature of altruism and the fact that there are many things I’m willing to stand up for even at a great expense to myself, and even if there is no direct benefit to me,” Greaves said that it was this type of thinking that really informed what he called the Satanic Reformation that leads to the creation of the Satanic Temple. [75] From his words, you can feel Mesner/Greaves is distancing himself publicly from Might is Right , but it simply seems like a good PR stunt, made to become a lot more acceptable to his demented pseudo-Satanic followers worldwide. A sort of commercialization of Satanism, pushed to the next level of Pop Culture, made simpler for the brainwashed masses of today. The late Sidney Parker, also known as S. E. Parker, (1929, 2012), a well-known British egoist individualist anarchist, who served the Satanic elite all his life, had this to say about Might is Right : Might Is Right is a work flawed by major contradictions. Like the Christian bible it can be used as a source for the most incompatible views, but unlike that venerable collection of idiocies and myths it is sustained by a crude vigor that at its most coherent can help to clear away not a few of the religious, moral and political superstitions bequeathed to us by our ancestors. Whoever Ragnar Redbeard was, and whatever criticisms may be justly leveled at his book, he remains worthy of the attention of all who are conscious that their \"rights\" are equal to their power.

Parker, help clarify the hate Satanists have for the 290"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Christian Bible, and the importance of this dangerous and blasphemous book described by The Chicago Tribune in the following manner: It will hypnotize your very soul, and send you forth into this world of pitiless and ferocious combat, a Conqueror of Men.

Wow that’s creepy, just as the title of chapter two of Ragnar Redbeard’s Satanic classic : Iconoclastic: Christian Ethics Impeached, Jesus the True Prince of Evil (The Mephistophiles of the World, King Among the Slaves).

I break away from all conventions. Alone, untrammelled, I raise up in stern invasion the standard of the strong. I gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah and pluck him by the beard - I uplift a broad ax and split open his worm-eaten skull. I blast out the ghastly contents of philosophically whited sepulchres and laugh with sardonic wrath. Then, reaching up from the festering and varnished facades of your haughtiest moral dogmas, I write thereon in letters of blazing scorn; \"Lo and behold, all this is fraud!\" I deny all things!

In Magick Without Tears , he wrote: The most important of all of the efforts of the White School, from an esoteric point of view, is Islam. In its doctrine there is some slight taint, but much less than in Christianity. It is a virile religion. It looks facts in the face, and admits their horror; but it proposes to overcome them by sheer dint of manhood. Unfortunately, the metaphysical conceptions of its quasi-profane Schools are grossly materialistic. It is only the Pantheism of the Sufis which eliminates the conception of propitiation [characteristic of the Black School]; and, in practice, the Sufis are too closely allied to the Vedantists to retain hold of reality. Crowley identified Mohammed, the Prophet of Islam, as a Saint of his Church, the E.G.C. (Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica), and as a Magus of his Illuminati inner circle known as the A.'.A.'., and Crowley directly compared his own relationship with the “praeterhuman intelligence” Aiwass, with Mohammed's special relationship to the Archangel Gabriel. During the Cairo working, which resulted in the channeled reception of The Book of the Law , in 1904, Crowley was of course living in a predominantly Muslim city. During his time in Egypt, according to his own account, he had assumed some disguise, probably with the intention of trying to study Islam from within, as he had done with Hinduism. With respect to his social circumstances at the time, he relates, We occasionally hobnobbed with a General Dickson, who had accepted Islam; otherwise, we knew nobody in Cairo except natives, carpet merchants, pimps, jewelers, and such small deer. And yet in his Confessions , he offers these details regarding Cairo in early 1904: As to my study of Islam, I got a sheikh to teach me Arabic and the practices of ablution, prayer and so on, so that at some future time I might pass for a Muslim among themselves. I learnt a number of chapters of the Koran by heart... My sheikh was profoundly versed in the mysticism and magic of Islam, and discovering that I was an initiate, had no hesitation in providing me with books and manuscripts on the Arabic Cabbala. These formed the basis of my comparative studies. 293"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Crowley claimed that his sheikh also taught him “many of the secrets of the Sidi Aissawa,” a Sufi tariqa or initiatory system. Many of Crowley's examples of yogic techniques of the mantra are in Arabic, and his description of them sometimes relates more strongly to the Sufi practice of dhikr . And his A.'.A.'. Illuminati program recommends to aspirants the study of “Sufi poetry generally.” In fact, the literary form of The Book of the Law has more in common with the Quran than with the Bible. Both Liber Legis and the Quran are very freely structured examples of what Northrop Frye calls the “oracle,” which he explains as the “typical episodic product” of the mythical mode of literary composition. Both texts allow for the dominance of the divine voice in what is ostensibly a communication through an angelic intermediary to a human prophet. Both texts presume the existence of a narrative and mythic background which they demonstrate more often through implication than exposition. Each of the two texts professes to be an initial eruption of the prophetic tradition in the particular language of its inscription. Crowley's “Annihilation” (itself a translation of fana , a Sufi term for a high mystical attainment) occurred during his work with the Enochian Aethyrs in the desert of Algeria, where he consecrated himself daily with a thousand and one recitals of the sura Al-Ikhlas (“Pure Faith”) from the Quran. Of course, it is well-known that in his later life, Crowley referred to the successor to his organizing authority as the “Caliph,” the Arabic title denoting the successor of Mohammed as the leader of the Muslim community. [77] In 1977, a new America n Ordo Templi Orientis was created by members of the United States Intelligence Community nicknamed the “Caliphate”, self-styled to be the worldwide Grand Lodge of the O.T.O, as I already discussed in my past publications. So in Thelema’s syncretic origins, Islam is prominent, but thi s characteristic is conveniently left aside by most of Crowley’s scholars. However, in some ways, Crowley’s teachings not only represent another step towards Modern Satanism, but also another Islamic heresy. Believe me, this is no coincidence! No wonder Islamic Turkish designer Dilara Findikoglu’s presented her Spring/Summer 2018 collection at London Fashion Week in September 2017, and it was nothing less than a Satanic Black Mass in plain sight. Indeed, the event took place at the altar of St Andrew Church in London and incorporated heavy occult and Satanic symbolism. In short, the event summed up everything the fashion world is truly about.

Some argue that we cannot discriminate against any group of people based on their religion. I proffer that we not only can, but we should, in the case of Islam and Satanism. Islam is antithetical to the well-being and safety of the United States, and the rest of the West, even in their own words, they are not really here to integrate, but to dominate, always remember that, as they have themselves admitted the corruption of most of their religious leaders in the hands of alien demonic entities they call the Jinn. When delivering a private address before a gathering of Muslims in London on June 6, 1985, a distinguished Islamic religious figure from Turkey, the late (Sunni Islam) Sufi Sheikh Nazim Effendi of the Naqshbandi tariqa of Dervishes who traced is lineage back to the Prophet Muhammad, when was asked a question about UFOs embarked upon a remarkable discussion and imparted much information of the greatest importance. He talked about the Jinns, the operators of this craft (hence the Jinn Theory of UFOs’ that I have exposed in great detail in T he Invisible Master: Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors and the puppet masters who pull the strings of Occult Power from The Alien World. Entities who share this planet with mankind although themselves much older than man, hold the human race in total subjection and enslavement, deliberately causing all manner of wars and strife and disasters and disturbances while sleeping mankind remains blissfully unaware of what is happening to it, and what its own true situation is. As other Sufi leaders who are usually persecuted by traditional Muslims, in recent years, he spoke of the Satanic Power of the Age... Also of “the steady infiltration of all human societies, all governments, and all religions by the demonic elements working for the downfall of man...” As Gordon Creighton explains: “The Arabian tradition asserts that, throughout all known history, there have been a few particular human beings who...have \"been in league with the Jinn s \" or “had a compact with the Jinn s ” - to such a degree that the Jinns have endowed them with what we regard as “preternatural powers” - ie., psychic power s . These humans have consequently, become known as wonder-workers, soothsayers, and magicians (called Muqarribun). ” In Islam, the infamous Night Journey of Muhammad took place in a cherub which they refer to as Al-Buraq (Buraq), which translates as ‘Lightning.’ Bu r aq was often portrayed as a great heavenly steed, the horse is a common Biblical symbol of a ch e rub (the word Buraq being in essence, an Islamicized backward spelling of the word cherub ) , with cherubim also being associated with lightning. In 295"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"addition to transporting the prophet Muhammad during his 7 th Century Night Journey, the Buraq was also according to Islamic legend said to have transported the prophet Abraham to Mecca in Saudi Arabia from a location inside Syria. Modern-day Libyan (Buraq Air) and Indonesian airlines (Buraq Indonesia Airlines) were aptly and adeptly named in the flying cherub’s honor. When one proceeds to spell the word Buraq backward (a common post-1 A.D Middle Eastern magic practice as it was said at the time the very mere mention of a demon’s true name was sufficient in order to summon its presence), or rather, when one reverses its already backwards rendered magical spelling, Buraq then becomes Qarub, a phonetic transcription of the Hebrew word kerubh (to be correctly “called” the demon’s true name must be pronounced quite accurately, this ironically enough suggesting a Hebrew influence on Muslim magic practices), in English spelled cherub from the Late Latin cheru b , by definition a “winged angel.” The backwards spelling was intended to avoid any accidental calls. Arab magicians, of course, are known as Muqaribun (a derivation of the word Qarub, spelled in the original sequence I might add. If one looks up the meaning of Qarib, the root of the word Muqaribun, one finds it to be “Another name for God” which in this case, is a cherub which many in this UFO flap area as evidenced in The Bible were in the habit of worshipping as gods), the most famous of the Muqaribun being the Sufi whirling dervishes, their traditions predating even Islam itself. Muhammad (or conversely, his followers) had been, in fact, quite deceived by the Jinn! And needless to say, Islam belongs, in fact, to the category of magic-based UFO religions as well. One example of an Arabic magic book is The Picatrix based on planetary talismanic magic, a compilation of various Middle Eastern magic traditions that was used and abused by none other than the famous womanizer and Freemason Giacomo Girolamo Casanova (1725-1798). 296"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"  The Nature of the Satanic enemy The enemy is never described in positive terms, after his sin. In heaven, before his sin, his name was Lucifer, which means “light-bringer.” Isaiah 14:12 states... How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! After the fall, his name is never associated with any good. However, the first name to be covered is Satan. The name Satan means adversary or the one who opposes us. Satan is not on God’s side, and he is not on our side, but he seems to be on the side of Islam and of most organized religions these days. Every religion thinks they are the only ones serving the true God, and they are the only ones going to heaven. The Jews, the Muslims, the Catholics, the Protestants. God does not live in a book my dear friends , He lives in the hearts of those who truly love and worship Him. Religions are used to unfortunately manipulate and control mankind, and to further the political agendas of the New World Order. Satan opposes us at every moment of our lives. He is the enemy of God, he is the enemy of righteousness, and he is our enemy, He is actively working 297"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"against the establishment of the kingdom of God at all times, and wants a robotic New World Order to enslave us, while he is still free to roam the earth. Because of this, in many countries around the world, Christians are now subject more and more to restrictions on speech and suffer communal violence and hate crimes. This is obviously the work of Satan, especially when the Jesuit Pope does practically nothing to stop it. For this reason, Islam is the ideal religion of the Satanic-Communist New World Order. When they start accumulating in countries they start terrorizing, with gangs of rapists, violence and civil disruption. It is already happening in Italy, where I live, and in the rest of Europe. Fundamentalist Muslims are demon possessed . They seek to spread fear and violence, they are pawns of the devil, or if you don’t believe in that, call them simply mercenaries of the NWO, like Isis or Al-Qaeda, idiots who feed off of the fear and suffering they create for their lust of power. Just as their Prophet, Mohammad, they use “God” as an excuse to prey on innocent people. Mohammad was a robber and a thief amongst other things, and his followers and his descendants are no different. It is not the Most High God they serve, but Satan and his allies in the New World Order. The Islamic world knows it will never be strong enough, by itself, to overthrow the existing world order where Western materialism reigns supreme, thanks to the Illuminati. But it could challenge that status quo with the right alliances. One seemingly unlikely alliance that Islam has forged is its alliance with the left wing. It doesn’t matter if they reject virtually everything for which the left claims to stand for: the peaceful resolution of international conflict; respect and tolerance for other cultures and faiths; civil liberties; freedom of expression; freedom of thought; human rights; democracy; women's rights; gay rights; and the separation of church and state, because this new breed of Marxists realized a long time ago that the US and the rest of the Western World would be too difficult to destroy militarily, at least while it enjoyed such a high level of economic prosperity. Therefore, before Communist countries like China or Russia back in their Soviet days, could conceivably launch an attack on America, it would first have to be severely weakened economically. This is where the Unholy Alliance between Communism & Islam became ideal for the Marxist scum bags of the New World Order. Did you ever hear anything about the International Pan Islamic Communist Party of Proletarian Islam? I am not joking! Daniel Greenfield wrote: “The International Pan Islamic Communist Party 298"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"of Proletarian Islam combines Islam, Communism, and Pan-Africanism for a combination of horrible things in one.” Its goal is a “Pan Islamic homeland which stretches from West Africa to Indonesia into one Nation State and Proletarian Islamic Socialist Superstate and Caliphate. which will be under the leadership of the Pan Islamic Working Class, with a Proletarian Islamic Socialist Government moving towards World Proletarian Islamic Communism.” [79] Daniel Greenfield continues by writing a brilliant article for frontpagemag.com: “In addition to this modest ambition, the red-and-green blender party also looks forward to a National Liberation of The New Afrikan Black Nation in the Black Belt South and other areas of The Historical New Afrikan Homeland in North America. Apparently, this Historical Liberation will involve the frequent use of Capital Letters and the abuse of the letter K.” Well, it is a bit like Magick , in the context of Aleister Crowley's Thelema, a term used to show and differentiate the occult from performance magic. Greenfield adds: “The party, whose name is much too long to write out, claims to take equal inspiration from the Koran, Das Kapital, and from Mohammed, Lenin, Mao and Fidel Castro. With a historical background of influences like that, how could they fail to bring peace and happiness to mankind? The synthesis between Islam and Communism is achieved by branding the most popular pedophile in the Middle East, a Socialist.” [80] Their website site claims without any sense of shame that: Prophet Muhammad Ibn Abdullah of Arabia was one of The greatest Socialist and Communist revolutionaries of All Time. In the space of 23 years, The Prophet Muhammad was able to establish the Socialist Society in Arabia. The job of Satan is indeed to thwart, obstruct, and come against anything that God and His people are trying to accomplish, but this is truly far out. And for those like my mother who doesn’t realize ideologically that ‘Socialism’ and ‘Communism’ are one in the same, well I hope you get it that they simply represent, according to Marxist theory, two consecutive stages in the revolutionary process. Other than that, the Communist Movement has always used the terms ‘socialist’ and ‘communist’ as synonyms, this means they are both Satanic in nature.   299"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"The following quotations should also remove any remaining doubt as to whether Communism is in reality Satanism: François Noël Babeuf, with his “Society of Equals” a direct forerunner of Communism (he was arrested and executed, though, after it was detected he had secretly arranged for a coup against the Directory government to be pulled off on May 11, 1796, known as the Babeuvian Conspiracy, the Conspiracy of Equals): The love of revolution has killed within me all other love and has made me as cruel as the devil.

De Molay was indeed furious in the last moments of his life and used his magical powers, having been forced to make a confession against his will, and despite retracting this confession after, he was charged with heresy and burned at the stake like a vulgar criminal. A sad episode for the Church, and something modern Neo-Templar Organizations commemorated with great solemnity and the celebration of a mass on the 18th of March 2018, i n Notre Dame cathedral, in Paris, during the 900 year anniversary of the foundation of the Order. 302"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"FIG 29 – Neo-Templars i n Notre Dame cathedral on the 18th of March 2018. However, aside from the considerations on the unjust end of the Templars, dismantled in 1307 by King Philip the Fair, some of the knights were actually corrupted by Satan and Islam, already during the order's peak, when they were a powerful Christian military order during the time of the Crusades. When the order was suppressed, the worship of Baphomet was not, unto itself, one of the charges, but a handful of the Templars arrested brought the name up on their own accord. So who is Baphomet? Baphomet is a term originally used to describe a supposed idol or another deity that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping, described variously as an idol with a human skull, a head with two faces, a cat idol or a bearded head. However, the name “Baphomet” originally was a deformation of the name of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. Claims that the Templars were worshipping “Baphomet” meant, in fact, that they were indeed closed Muslims. In the book, The Dictionary of Demons – Names of the Damned , by Michelle Belanger , the author goes on to expand just a little bit more on this topic and its relation, to both, demonology and Islam: Baphomet: A demon commonly depicted as a goat-headed being, often hermaphroditic, sometimes with wings. Baphomet made his (or her) entrance into the annals of demonology through transcripts of the trials of the Knights Templar. For a variety of reasons, most of them monetary, this knightly order had come under suspicion in Europe, and the entire group was ultimately arrested and tried – with many of the knights being put to death. Among the charges brought against the Templars was the assertion that they had abandoned their Christian faith, instead worshipping a 303"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"curious idol given the name Baphomet. Material that has survived from French troubadours active in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries suggests that the name Baphomet was originally a corruption of the name Muhammad which at the time was commonly rendered Mahomet. If this is true, then the figure of Baphomet may have come up in relation to the Templars as an implication that they had turned to the faith of their enemies, the Muslims. So it is clearly stated here, that there were strong suspicions that the Templars had abandoned Christianity, and taken up the religion of Islam. This theory tends to generalize and impeach all the Knights Templar without any distinction when in reality there was only a minority involved in the Islamic infiltration of this powerful order that was widespread all across Europe and the Middle East. No precise numbers exist, but it is estimated that during their period of maximum expansion of the Order, there were probably between 15,00 and 20,000 Templars, of whom about a tenth were actual knights. In those days, there was no internet, no phones, no ways to have an instant form of communication for any institution. So among all the churches, and castles, of this order, there was indeed the possibility, that some Templar communities, living more isolated than others, could be infiltrated and corrupted by the new Faith of Islam. Well, in the 1950’s, this hypothesis was fully confirmed during an excavation made by an archaeologist under the ruins of a Templar Church in Turkey, when a strange Templar cross with the image of a bearded Mohammed on it, was found. It was the infamous Baphomet that turned out to be an Islamic heresy. Of course, this very important discovery has been kept out of the public eye since then, because of the vast implications that could jeopardize the new neo-Templar trend in the Christian world. My friend, the late Gabriele Mandel Khān (1924-2010), fortunately, took a pic of it before the controversial artifact was sent back to a remote deposit for archaeological collections, probably in Istanbul. Gabriele, who later published his finding in an Italian publication. He was a Freemason, Italian psychologist, writer, and artist of Afghan descent, who was also known as the Sufi guide (shaikh) of the Jerrahi Halveti, and someone I mentioned in Pope Francis: The Last Pope?  Returning to the Baphomet mystery, the final transformation of Baphomet occurred in 1854, when French occultist and Illuminati, Eliphas Lévi, formulated the modern conception of the Baphomet figure via an illustration, portraying it with wings, a horned goats head and an emblazoned pentagram, that was used recently, as a reference by The 304"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Satanic Temple, for their infamous 8 1/2 foot statue of Baphomet. Only a few years after Eliphas Lévi’s esoteric illustration was published, the image, appeared in the work of Leo Taxil, as part of an elaborate hoax promoted by the Jesuits, where the Freemasons were accused of worshipping it, a lie that still many Christians even today believe is true. Having said this Eliphas Levi's Baphomet, was actually adopted by Aleister Crowley, most famously in his Gnostic Mass, where we find it invoked as the serpent and the lion, as the speaking voice who reveals Liber A'ash. It was incorporated into the theology of Thelema, and in turn into the iconography of LaVeyan Satanism. The mysterious figure of Baphomet still possesses great importance to Thelemites (followers of Crowley’s Satanic religion), and is even featured in Crowley's initiatic name as OHO. The links between Communism, Islam, and Satanism, don’t stop here, as well as the links between Islam and Thelema. All this scum have a common denominator, which links them together in their hatred for Christianity, and that’s the work of Satan and his Legion/Demons who use and manipulate people, religions, and ideology, as vessels for carrying out their demonic duties in gruesome ways. I wonder for example, what Aleister Crowley would have said about what happened on April 23rd, 2017, in the church of Rennes-le-Château , made famous worldwide by the Dan Brown novel, that was viciously attacked by a Muslim woman, during the national election day in France. The woman said to be in her twenties, reportedly inquired at the towns tourism office at 9:00 AM, about when the church opened and spoke partially in what one witness described as “Arabic.” She then entered the church around 11:15 with an ax, and quickly attacked several well-known items. The woman, dressed in a white cloak, with her face hidden behind a Venetian mask, attacked the holy water font with an ax, decapitated the famous \"red devil\" (a statue of the demon Asmodeus from the Old Testament), and placed a Quran next to his chopped-off arm. She then lacerated the bas-relief of Mary Magdalene's altar in front of shocked witnesses, also chopping off the head of Mary Magdalene. The woman, obviously possessed, was then stopped by a church visitor. The police soon arrived, along with the Mayor and another town official, and the unidentified woman was taken into custody never to be seen or heard of again. Under questioning, the woman was apparently calm and was 305"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"reported to have said, “Today is a presidential election here, while in Syria, the West bombs and kills children.

I'm home, you're not home!” Can you believe it? We Christians are not home any longer in our own churches. Has this world gone completely insane? Remember that real Knights Templar, were never connected to any of this, and always remained true Christians, and defenders of the real Faith, and not infidel Muslims or Satanists. This wrong narrative needs to end.

So after a few attempts, I finally reached two of the most charismatic figures in today’s study of Alchemy, Gnostic Spirituality, Kabbalah, Theurgy, Astrology, of course Freemasonry, and what I call the world of the real Illuminati, not your average conspiracy theorist. Two leading personalities from the US, each with their own view, that did not know of each others interview, are about to shock my readers in this appendix to the various subjects touched in my book. Of course, the opinions expressed in the following unedited interviews, are those of Mark Stavish and David Griffin, and do not always reflect the view of the author. I am not afraid of the truth, or different opinions, and I am immensely grateful to the following illustrious figures, who have agreed to participate in this project for the benefit of the Western Initiatic System and society. 309"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" Mark Stavish QUESTIONS for author and Freemason Mark Stavish from Wyoming Lodge No. 468, Director of the Institute for Hermetic Studies, who published several books worldwide related to Freemasonry, and is often used as an expert consultant for programs on Freemasonry for the History Channel and Animal Planet. 1) Who is Mark Stavish and what does the Institute for Hermetic Studies represent in today’s Masonic and esoteric world? REPLY: I am a practitioner and author of esotericism with about forty years experience. I started the Institute for Hermetic Studies in 1998 as a local group with an operating temple for the instruction in various esoteric practices. Over the years we have published nearly thirty books, many of which are available in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Estonian, and Polish. We are unaffiliated with any other organizations and operate with the philosophy that esotericism needs to be dis-occulted while still working within the framework that ethics are important. However, secrecy as it is generally known is not needed and is even dangerous. True occult or esoteric knowledge is as His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche said about Vajrayana, ’self-secret’. That is, one must actually do the work to understand it, so teaching opening cannot violate anything sacred. Too often secrecy is a means of covering the ignorance of would-be teachers. 310"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" We are not an initiatic organization and offer no initiations, as such, we are also not affiliated with any Masonic body. We do encourage what in the United States of America is referred to as the Traditional Observance Movement, as well as the formation of ”philosophical lodges”, but this is in line with our general philosophy. However, this does not confer any Masonic affiliation for the Institute for Hermetic Studies. 2) What do you believe is the reason for the present decline of the Western Initiatic System and the rise of Satanism in our society? REPLY: There are several factors at work. First there is the distinction between initiatic systems which are primarily fraternal in nature such as Freemasonry or even the OTO, and those which are clearly esoteric or occult in nature, wherein, ritual initiation is designed to have an effect on the candidates psychic structures. The rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, various gnostic groups, and, of course, the now well know empowerments of Tibetan Buddhism – vajrayana or tantra – are designed to do. Historically esotericism in the West has always operated on the fringes. It had some brief shining moments in the sun during the Renaissance, but that ended. Movements and groups were established, but membership was difficult, teachings not always clear. Even groups such as the Pietists who were very esoteric and mystical, but no threat to the establishment powers, were often the subject of extreme persecution which prompted many to come to the North American colonies. This means that even in family traditions, the ”initiatic chain” was more like a thread and easily broken. So, when we speak of initiation in Western esotericism it is a tremendous challange to find a group that has been operating continuously for twenty years, let alone two-hundred. In practice, this means we are constantly recreating the wheel and the whole vehicle that goes with it! This means that few people are actually trained in a traditional manner wherein there is a connection to an actual system that has genuine elders. For me, that means three or more generations of practitioners. This is further compounded by the current ease with which information is 311"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"obtained. There is little sense of connection or commitment, and what does exist is more that of a fantasy than a real working relationship. Any fifteen year old with a library card can set themselves up as the head of an occult order in a few hours with the internet and no one would be the wiser if they were actully creative and intelligent enough. It is strange to say but our history of religious intolerance has been both the cause of our lack of esoteric integrity and material success. The growing scientific model and the industrial revolution allowed us to focus more on demonstrable material power than theoretic spiritual power and the subjective baggage it carried. Fast forward to the present and that translates into wealth, freedoms, and availability of information unimagined just two generations ago. This also means a false sense of individual omnipotence that is really nothing more than an uninteruppted electirical power and food delivery systems. This material success also has a dark side which discourages people from considering the spiritual or esoteric. This we can call Satanic in the classical sense in that it means, ’opposition’. Satan is less a person or force as it is our own laziness, ease of distraction, and habituated focus on only what we consider important to ourself. In this way we see many ’good’ people whom we like and trust are actually ’satanic’. Then there is the notion of organized evil. This falls under the heading of demonic forces, the qlippoth of the qabala, even egregores or collective psychic forces and entities. While it is easy to think of these evil forces only in terms of the obvious – stereotypical bad guys, it is more important to see them for what they are: opportunistic parasites that feed off our anger, fear, and greed. Thus anything, from Political Correctness to hyper-nationalism that can keep people angry, distracted, and afraid is Satanic. The emotions generated is the food for the demon or demons – for we are Legion. Mass media plays a large roll in this, in particular movies, music, and what is passed off as news reporting. In Europe the entire EU system is a demonic egregore, born out of fear and greed, now destroying its host organisms out of fear and greed as well. 312"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" Because of course, the EU, Political Correctness, and Progressive politics are essentially materialistic in nature. I do not say atheistic, although that would do, but there are schools of metaphysical atheism such as Buddhism. So, materialism is the nature of Communism, and of course, Satanism in its formal and informal definitions. One could argue that the uptick you are suggesting is also the result of the cycle we are in. Traditionalist philosophers such as Julius Evola, but more practically and importantly Alaine Danielou, believe that we are in the final stages of the Kali Yuga. The same has been said to me by several Tibetan lamas. What makes this most interesting is that the end phase is clearly characterised by a final battle for control against a world domination from Islam. Try saying that in public and see what kind of reaction you get! I say that in all seriousness because we have a saying in the US, ”You know who is in charge by who you cannot criticise.” So, I give that to you as an example, do with it what you will. 3) What is your relationship to New Age belief systems like Thelema and its creator Aleister Crowley? REPLY: The term New Age is a tricky one as for many it means those psycho-spiritual philosophies and practices that took bloom in the 1970s. Clearly they are related to earlier systems, Theosophy and New Thought being at their core, but as you have intimated, along with it – although tangentially compared to other topics – ritual magic. The source of most of that magic was the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, primarily as revealed by Israel Regardie, and of course, Aleister Crowley. For this reason, it is nearly impossible for anyone who has any involvement as a practitioner in the New and Emerging Religions that emerge out of the New Age Movement NOT to have some historical relationship with Crowley – even if they are unaware of it. As for Crowley in particular, he is not a major focus of my personal work. 4) Do you perceive Thelema’s many links to Modern Satanism as a threat to the image of Regular Freemasonry, as Robert Gilbert stated years ago? REPLY: I have heard of his comments but not read them, therefore I am 313"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"unable to offer an informed reply regarding his specific accusations. 5) What is your position, if any, towards groups like the O.T.O., and do you feel you can embrace Regular Freemasonry and Crowleyanity at the same time ? REPLY: I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the O.T.O. but maintain a pleasant relationship with several of its national officers. That said, I see no reason for there to be a conflict between being a member of both organizations. This does, however, make a distinction between being a member of the OTO and as you have put it, embracing ”Crowleyanity” or the notion of Aleister Crowley being the final word - or rather the new word, or Word of the Aeon – and therefore imitated by too many of his readers rather than understood and if need be, ignored. As a broad generalization, I have found that those people who become deeply committed to the OTO are interested in different things than those who become deeply committed to Freemasonry. This, however, is only my experience, yours may vary. 6) Do you believe the roots of Speculative Freemasonry are mainly Christian as believed before 1813? REPLY: No. The host of non-Christian elements in early Freemasonry are clearly visible to anyone who wants to see them. The notion of Masonry being focused around the Temple of Solomon – itself Jewish – and not the New Jerusalem of Revelations is itself a non-Christian, or pre-Christian foundation. If anything, the symbolism of Freemasonry is Hermetic and Kabbalistic and that is the premise I put forth in my book, Freemasonry – Rituals, Symbols, and History of the Secret Society. Your readers can find it in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Estonian. Now, Freemasonry was and still is composed of members who mainly profess to be Christian. However, any religious litmus test for membership in BLUE LODGE goes against the fundamental Masonic principles. The Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which claims to be among the oldest in the United States and third oldest in the world, was formed in 1731, had members that were Jewish. While some Masonic Rites have a Christian requirement, they are the minority. 314"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 7) Can you tell us more about your fascination for the Golden Dawn tradition? I would not use the word fascination to describe my relationship with the Golden Dawn Tradition, but rather, for the longest time, it was as we say, ”the only game in town” if you wanted to learn ritual magic. Nearly everyone has some experience with it, and its methods can be found far and wide, in as diverse and seemingly opposite groups as modern Wicca, neo-paganism, and LaVey’s brand of Satanism (the Church of Satan) with his rewriting of the Enochian Calls. The Golden Dawn methods are very effective for altering consciousness and experiencing certain inner or visionary states. They can be problematic in that it is, as Pat Zalewski has pointed out, important to have the initiations that go with them. But the initiations are themselves very complex and require a competent team of a half-dozen people or more. Because of the nature of initiation, as we previously discussed, this can act as a bridge, but there is a difference between performing a ceremony and conferring an esoteric initiation . 8) What do you think of the various Golden Dawn factions operating in today’s magical world, often in contrast with each other? REPLY: I have no formal relationship with any of the Golden Dawn organizations in existence although I have a very pleasant and helpful relationship with several of its better-known leaders. Currently, the entire Golden Dawn movement is being rocked with a heavy politicising of the movement wherein, it is being stated that only those of a left-leaning, progressive, or so-called ’liberal’ political orientation can be a member. Those who are apolitical, libertarian, or conservative are to be denied membership or expunged from the rolls. The same struggle is going on within the OTO. As such, I have no official connection with any Golden Dawn order, lodge, or movement, as I am unconcerned with such things. 9) Charles “Chic” Cicero has created in the last decade, a Rosicrucian Order with ex-members of the S.R.I.A, such as Robert Gilbert, who likes to initiate and work in fancy castles across 315"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Europe. Do you want to comment on this new Rosicrucian reality, and what is their true mission? REPLY: I am not a member of the SRIA, nor have I discussed this organization with anyone, therefore I cannot give an informed comment on its stated purpose or ‘true mission’. 10) As a regular Freemason what is your position in regards to so- called “Mystic Masonry” or fringe Masonic rites ? REPLY: Many of the so-called fringe Masonic rites from the lists that I have seen, are not Masonic. For example, I have seen Martinism listed as fringe Masonic. At one time, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was listed as a’dangerous occult organization’ in the Masonic publication, The New Age. So for those of you consumed by conspiracies there is a direct contradiction for you. But my point is simple, many organizations laid claim to by the College of Rites are not, nor have ever been Masonic and they enact them. So, it is a bit hypocritical for Regular Masons to get upset by what they call ’fringe’ or ’clandestine’ Masonry unless there is criminal activity, or activities directly damaging to Regular Masonry, going on. That said, if Regular Masonry in the United States at least, were more philosophical and yes, esoteric, or open to those possibilities in some fashion such as reading groups, etc, then the appeal of fringe Masonry would be dramatically lessened. But even here, let’s be honest, most of the groups we are talking about are barely functioning in many respects. They make promises on occult secrets and never deliver. Even those which have access to very good information seem unable to keep from falling apart from internal schisms every seven to ten years or so. Regular Masonry needs to focus on improving itself and not be concerned about anything else. 12 ) Stanislao De Guaita, Cabalistic founder of the Cabalistic Order of the Rosicrucian, in his book Temple of Satan , does not limit the dark side of the Illuminati to Adam Weishaupt’s order, but to a vast number of groups involved with the occult, and he 316"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"was not a conspiracy theorist. What is your view on what I defined in my trilogy as the Illuminati network? REPLY: Well, here we need to look at the notion of egregores, or collective psychic entities. From this perspective conspiracy is simple as the conspiracy is one of thought or ideas, rather than having everyone sit down at a table and create an action plan. That may happen, but we have no way of proving it. What does matter is the egregore. That we can kill, that we can limit and even eliminate – but on the psychic or astral level where it lives. According to occult theory, if you want to give birth to something or to kill something, it must be done in the invisible first. Another principle is that ’like is known by like’ so in that respect, formal meetings by human beings is not needed when it is really the egregore that is in charge of each of them and whatever groups they are in or represent. Fortunately, the reverse is true for good, healthy, and productive movements as well. But this in turn gives rise to what is called, ’the war in the heavens’ wherein the various psychic forces battle for control of and on behalf of humanity. 13 ) Do you think there is a growing magical threat to President Trump? REPLY: I know there are many people attempting to grab headlines about it, but as to their effectiveness, I have little concern. There are however, many forms of magic that have little relationship to people dressing up in robes and playing at having occult power. We need only examine the various forms of psychic research undertaken by the United States in the 1970s until the 1990s and the Soviet Union during from the 1920s until its collapse. I am certain that research is still going on, officially or unofficially through think-tanks and other research arms, and not simply with the superpowers. Occultism has long been an unofficial arm of government, we need only look at John Dee and the circles he ran in for confirmation. Gary Lachman wrote a good book on the topic, Politics and the Occult – The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen . There is also some recent material out there about Hillary Clinton and her on-again, off- again relationship with the New Age leaders, and of course, her campaign Chairman and former Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton, John Podesta. It was fascinating to listen to many of the would-be leaders of modern occultism either be silent or in denial about the occult significance of the so-called 317"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"’spirit cooking’ art of Serbian artist Marina Abramovich to which he was invited to attend by his brother, but declined. Then of course we have the recent statement by Washington socialite Sally Quinn that she used magic to murder people all while claiming the moral high ground against Sarah Palin. So, if we consider the magic to be the power of the mind, or more accurately, the focused power of the mind to create events, then it is always happening. Like it or not, those who are in power just do it better than most of those outside of it. I believe that Professor Ioan Couliano, whose murder is still somewhat of a mystery, said it quite well in his book, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance , when he pointed out that what was once magic was now the purview of media managers, public relations specialist, psychologists, and by extension, governments and their efforts at social manipulation and control. His work is essential to understanding what is going in the world today. Trump himself is no stranger to the esoteric philosophy we call ’the power of positive thinking’ , so, I think he can handle himself in this regards. 14) I read with great interest your work on the Chamber of Reflection featured only in certain rites and related jurisdictions, so what is your favorite Masonic Rite and why? REPLY: I have no favorite rite because they are all so wonderful in their own unique ways. Everyone I know who is a Mason, even if they have not been to a lodge in twenty years, remembers their Third Degree, or ”Degree of a Master Mason”. It is truly one of the finest initiatic experiences one can have. I do wish the Chamber of Reflection was more widely used as it is the first thing a candidate would encounter on their Masonic journey. It is critical for several reasons, but because it asks the most important question as a Mason or non-Mason you will ever be asked, ’Why are you here?” Now, it does not do so in those words, but in its context and content. Why do you want to join this lodge? Remember, until very recently being a mason was a death sentence in many countries, and in several still is. Why do you want to join this organization? Why are you sitting in lodge instead of doing something else? Why are you on this planet? What are you doing that gives your life meaning? The Chamber of 318"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Reflection asks all of those questions. 15)Can regular Freemasonry have an important role in society again? REPLY: Yes, and it will, but why and when are to be seen. At the moment, we as Freemasons must encourage a more active membership, and by active I do not mean simply activities that keep the lights on and the bills paid, but philosophically and spiritually. The light needs to burn more brightly, and it can, and it will. But it will be a different Freemasonry than we are used to today, at least in the Anglo-Saxon world, and the US in particular. It will be smaller, more expensive, and more selective in who it lets in to be a member. That is the way of things, and not just in Freemasonry, in esotericism as well. This is the Kali Yuga and we are heading to critical point in the near future. The days of easy spirituality in the comfort of your own home are soon to disappear. People will not be able to be passive members of half-dozen organizations, they will have be selective and committed members of one, two, or three at most – and that includes  David Griffin QUESTIONS for David Griffin G.H.

Aleister Crowley nearly murdered the Golden Dawn. British intelligence sent Crowley to infiltrate our order and destroy it by publishing our secret initiation rites and spiritual training materials. The job fell to me to clean up the mess from Crowley’s attack and to heal the Golden Dawn’s Rosicrucian Inner Order from this nearly mortal blow. In order to heal the R.R et A.C., in 1999 we moved all materials profaned by Crowley to the Outer Order. Since the material had been profaned anyway, I wrote my Ritual Magic Manual to make this published Golden Dawn Magick available and easy to use by everyday people. Next we painstakingly replaced the profaned materials with earlier spiritual techniques from Rosicrucian and Hermetic initiatic sources. This took years but we have preserved the magical purpose of the original R.R. et A.C. Second Order system, yet with completely unpublished Egyptian and Chaldean magical hierarchies. This is important so that the system remains spiritually pure and clean for better effects. Crowley did his best to destroy the Golden Dawn. He failed. We survived and continue to protect humanity from the forces of darkness even today. 3) Is Thelema’s many links to Modern Satanism a threat to the work you are doing?

Our order has nothing to do with OTO or with Aleister Crowley’s Thelema. When OTO was originally founded in Germany, it had at least some spiritual value. That went out the window, however, when OTO was co-opted by Aleister Crowley, and deviated into the Thelemic propaganda tool it has degenerated into today. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is not a Thelemic order. We are a Hermetic and Rosicrucian order, steeped in these extremely valuable Western spiritual traditions. I was unaware that the OTO is actively working against President Trump. I am aware, however, of a group of Satanists and misguided Wiccans who have been doing monthly ”binding spells” against President Trump and his supporters. If O.T.O. is part of these monthly magical attacks on our Republic and our President, then O.T.O. is indeed a problem, as is their infiltration of academia. 5) What is your view of the Jesuit led New World Order, the Vatican and the Abrahamic religions? I am first and foremost a Hermetic Master. As such, I hold the truth embodied in all of the world’s religions in high regard. As the Universe is actually one single living organism, there is in reality only one truth, codified through local cultural symbol systems into religions. As far as Abrahamic religions go, my great love is Christianity. The original message of Jesus Christ holds the key to the evolution of humanity, but Christian churches have lost their way. The original message of Jesus Christ to his disciples was a message of spiritual liberation . The Vatican turned this message on its head - degrading the original message into yet another tool for mankind’s enslavement instead. 321"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"The AΩ seeks to restore Christianity to its rightful place as a force for spiritual liberation , as it originally was in Christ’s inner circle. Most Christian churches today teach only the outer forms. The inner teachings given by Christ to his closest disciples have been all but lost. For example, most Christian churches today give only the Water baptism of John the Baptist, and not the three original baptisms of Jesus Christ himself. These were very early on declared heretical by the Vatican and repressed by the church. Most people don’t even know that Christ transmitted three (not one) baptisms to his disciples; Water, Fire, and Spirit. Christ’s Water baptism is a rite of purification. The Fire baptism ignites the Soul fires of your energetic body. The Spirit baptism opens your spiritual vision in the higher dimensions, including the Kingdom of the Father inside the stars at the fast vibrating end of the Universe inside of light. Under multiple Episcopal authorities, the Alpha Omega operates a ”free church” which transmits all three of Jesus Christ’s forbidden baptismal rites. Moreover, also banned by the Vatican, there also still exists the secret magical system Jesus Christ taught to his disciples for “Rapture” – how to ascend on the dimensional planes to the Kingdom of the Father inside the universe of light. 6) What is your position on Christianity, and do you believe we are living in the End Times? Sadly, we do appear to be witnessing the rise of the Anti-Christ global spy state, where sub-dermal microchips (the Mark of the Beast) will be required even to buy or sell. It is essential that before the Anti-Christ global government is established, that at a very minimum, the original Christian magical technology for ”Rapture” (spiritual ascension) be revealed again today, this time in an easy to understand form readily usable by modern individuals. Making these forbidden rites of Christianity available is a primary mission of the AΩ. 7) Can you tell us more about your lineage of the Golden Dawn and the 322"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Rosicrucian tradition operating within? I was initiated in the grades of the outer order by Cris Monnastre, and in the 6=5 and 7=4 Adeptus Exemptus grades by Marquis Nicholas Tereschenko and Jean-Pascal Ruggiu of the Ahathoor Temple No 7 in Paris, which they had revived in 1982 upon their return from England. It was at the Serapis temple in London under the direction of Apollon Leontas and the guidance of Desmond Bourke, where the most important Golden Dawn lineages were transmitted to Golden Dawn Chiefs to France, then on to America with me. It is important to note that traditionally in the Golden Dawn and derivative orders, all order lineages and authorities are vested in the 7=4 Adeptus Exemptus grade, ergo the importance of the line of transmission of this particular grade. In 2002, I made contact with Frater LVX e Tenebris, a representative of the ”Secret Chiefs” who had originally contacted S.L. MacGregor Mathers in Paris. Over time, they gave me the teaching materials and initiation rituals that had been prepared for the Golden Dawn’s highest grades from the beginning, called the Third Order. They also issued me additional Hermetic and Rosicrucian charters. Today, in the Rosicrucian Mystery School of AΩ, we teach the traditional triad of Rosicrucian spiritual disciplines – Magick, Alchemy, and Qaballah (and NOT Mysticism). 8) Charles “Chic” Cicero not only operates a Golden Dawn faction contrary to your standing as Imperator, but has created in the last decade a Rosicrucian Order with ex members of the S.R.I.A like Robert Gilbert, that likes to initiate and work in castles across Europe. Do you want to comment on this group and what is their mission? I know nothing really about this Rosicrucian group other than it is a schismatic group of SRIA. I have virtually nothing to do with it. I believe that SRIA, using their contacts in British intelligence have been responsible for many of the attacks on our order and on me on the internet. As fierce and independent as Donald Trump is in politics and Alex Jones is in media, so am I in modern esotericism. The AΩ and our dependent 323"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"schools have survived defamation attacks, hack attacks, legal attacks, you name it. I have even survived engineered schisms designed by outside groups to remove me from leadership. 9) I know you are also a high grade Freemason (33, 90, 96 Degree - Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misraim - in possession of the complete and true Arcana Arcanorum), what is your position in regards to so-called ”Regular” Freemasonry compared to “Mystic Masonry” ? As regards Regular freemasonry, I was initiated in Blue Lodge, the A.A.S.R. and the York Rite in the U.S.A. and in the Swedish Rite in Sweden. To be honest with you, I am disappointed with masonry in America. American Masons need to learn from our European counterparts. At least in Europe, many lodges have preserved the pageantry and beauty of original Freemasonry. To be perfectly honest though, I am somewhat disappointed even with European Freemasonry, due to its general lack of esoteric substance. Take the Swedish Rite, for example. The Swedish Rite was once a Rite rich in Rosicrucian Magick and Alchemy. Today, however, this esoteric content has been completely suppressed due to the influence of the Swedish Church. Sadly, this once highly magical Freemasonic rite, has been reduced to just another symbolical rite. Today, in the HOGD (AΩ) we do not specifically target Freemasons for recruitment, but Masons seeking training in Rosicrucian Magick and Alchemy, do find themselves quite at home in our order due to the Freemasonic structure of our Temple rites. In fact, many Masons find the esoteric content in the G.D. that they were originally searching for in Freemasonry. In the AΩ, we recruit today not only from among Masons, but from all walks of life, primarily though internet advertising and email marketing. We are bringing ancient mysteries to our people using modern methods. 10) I describe the Golden Dawn tradition as part of the Illuminati mystery schools and their network, do you agree with my vision? I have been attacked on Illuminati conspiracy film after film on YouTube as part of the defamation campaign against me on the Internet. No. I 324"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"personally do not consider the Golden Dawn as part of any sort Illuminati network. The word ”Illuminati” is completely negatively tainted. People don’t easily understand the difference between ”Illuminati” and ”Illuminism” (or Enlightenment). In truth, since the time of the founding of the Illuminati of Bavaria by the Jesuits, they have been bitterly opposed by an alliance of Rosicrucian and Knight Templar orders. These are not “Illuminati” per se, although they are indeed ”illuminist” (or Enlightenment) traditions. Back in the 1700s, it was the Golden Rosicrucians and the Strict Observance who provided the spiritual muscle to counter the Illuminati threat back then. Today the Rosicrucian Mystery School of AΩ and the revived Strict Order of Templars continue the fight for the liberation of humanity against the forces of Endarkenment. Who I refer to ”Illuminati” are perhaps better described ”slaver Magicians” who, left to their own devices, would completely enslave mankind. As a Rosicrucian Imperator and Hermetic Master, I am locked in a death battle between the Magick of Light and Illuminati Enslavement Sorcery. This magical war for the spiritual liberation and solar ascension of humanity has raged already for Millennia. What is different now is that we are winning for a change! 11) I know you are opposing the growing magical threat to president Trump, how can we help him win against the dark side? For centuries, Illuminati slavers have held the upper hand in the magical war for the future of humanity. Why? Because they are willing to use the most evil forms of Magick, including human sacrifice to achieve their aims. It is extremely difficult to overcome the power of such evil Magick, without resorting to evil and becoming contaminated by it oneself. Things have changed recently though. At Winter Solstice 2015, we rallied a rag tag magical militia made up of Christian prayer warriors, Magicians, Witches, and Shamans, to synchronize our Magick and prayers at the time of the Winter Solstice, with the common intention to ”bind Daesh” (ISIS) who had been goose-stepping across the Middle East back then, taking slaves completely unchecked. This, together with a second operation with a quickly gathered magical ”army” at Summer Solstice 2016 ”for the liberation of humanity from all forms of slavery and enchantment,” we created a magical opening and a beach head, wherein the evil of Daesh was contained and a populist 325"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"President ejected the Shadow Government from the Presidency for the first time in decades. Suddenly, using this new battle tactic, we found ourselves winning skirmish after skirmish for the first time in Centuries. Unfortunately, the Darksiders were quick to adapt to our new battle strategy. They began raising a magical army of their own, using naive Witches as cannon fodder, with monthly rituals to ”bind Trump and those who support him.” Of course, the numbers of idiot Witches grew and grew, fueled by mainstream media hype and Hollywood star power to inflate their numbers and dwarf our chivalrous band of light warriors. These monthly ”bind Trump and his supporters” rituals today are far more dangerous than they might appear. In my opinion, these Black Magick operations launched at the time of the Black Moon each month are directly magically responsible for the recent tragedy in Las Vegas, where hundreds of Trump supporters were brutally gunned down by sniper(s) firing from an elevated position. Witch Queen Leslie McQuade and I have been organizing the magical resistance to this monthly onslaught as best we could since last Winter. At first, as a stop gap measure, we used ourselves as living ”poppets”, magical decoy targets protecting our POTUS and FLOTUS by drawing the evil Magick of the Black Witches off of them and onto ourselves in the Mojave desert, where we could safely neutralize the energy of the attacks on our magical defenses at AΩ temple. As this solution became increasingly dangerous to maintain, we had to switch tactics again, so we began gathering prayer and magical militias each month to help us counter this evil. The Black Witches strike with Black Moon each month, as the moon disappears into darkness two days prior to New Moon. Our group of light warriors counter this evil with our own synchronized rites each month with the first appearance of the silver crescent 2 days following New Moon. We use prayer and the Magick of Light with the common intention ”to liberate humanity from all forms of bondage and enchantment.” You and I are living at a pivotal moment in history. You can best help by adding your power to ours at each New Moon. Use your own Magick, prayer, or whatever is most comfortable to you. What matters is our common intention for the liberation of humanity and that we synchronize our rites each New Moon. Or next unified rites will be on October 21, November 20, and December 20, each at 11:59 PM ET. Everyone is encouraged to use what you do best; pray, invoke, spell cast or drum. What matters is our synchronized rites and our common intention. 326"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Meanwhile, word recently reached us of an ever growing group of Magicians, Witches, Shamans, and Christian prayer warriors spontaneously gathering at the time of our rites each month at the Trump star on Hollywood Blvd. Hopefully, this will grow and the Trump star will become a flash point where women and men of pure heart and noble intent will gather each month to hold the line together against the encroaching Darkness. This month on October 21, Leslie McQuade and I will travel to the Trump star in Hollywood to further investigate and to report live from the event. The Black Witches and Illuminati slavers have mainstream media and celebrities swelling their numbers each month. Stand with us this and every New Moon as we hold a line against this evil. Spiritual light warrior, we know you are reading this ... YOU can make all the difference to help to turn the tide of this battle. At present, we are badly outnumbered and outgunned – and desperately in need of reinforcement. Light warrior! Answer the call of your heart and pick up that sword of light. Stand with us, as we face down this evil - for the liberation and ascension of human kind. The forces of darkness are on the move. We confront an enemy so evil they use human sacrifice to fuel their Spells to destroy us. Shall you pick up that light sword and join us in this struggle? Or will you leave it laying there to rust and return to a muggle life? About one thing I am absolutely sure. We must not and can not lose this war. There will be no second chance. Despite recent victories, our situation remains grim. In this fight, we are the last line of defense, and we are badly outnumbered and outgunned. In fact, dear light warrior...
