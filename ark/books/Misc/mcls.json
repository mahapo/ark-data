The Handbook was followed by the original Manual for Complex Litigation, published in 1969. It largely reflected the experience of judges who managed the electrical equipment antitrust litigation in the 1960s and focused on judicial control and scheduling of discovery and pretrial preparation. In 1985, the Manual for Complex Litigation, Second appeared, broadening the scope of litigation management to include issue definition and narrowing. Publication of the Manual Second was a recognition of the rapid and dramatic changes taking place in the nature of federal litigation and the courts’ need to re - spond with appropriate management techniques and practices. Those changes have continued apace, marked by the emergence of new kinds of claims and pro - cesses for litigating them, expansion of the federal courts’ jurisdiction, and in - creases in their workload. New legislation, case law, and rules have altered the framework in which litigation is conducted. The editors of the Manual Second foresaw these trends when they said that it would “not represent the final word on proper management of complex litigation” and urged that it be “periodically re - vised on the basis of new developments and experiences.” † The magnitude of new developments and the variety of experiences in complex litigation over the last ten years warrants publication of this Manual for Complex Litigation, Third . The Handbook and the original Manual broke new ground in advocating ju - dicial case management. By 1985, however, the role of the judge as a case manager had become widely accepted—in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in local rules and standing orders, in the literature, and in the prevailing practices in the federal courts. And by 1994, that role had evolved from an option to an acknowl - edged judicial responsibility. ‡ Given the federal courts’ growing dockets and the increasing complexity, cost, and time demands of litigation, judicial control through effective management techniques and practices is now considered im - perative. These changes in the environment of complex litigation also lead to a change in the role of the Manual : The procedures it describes and suggests have now * 25 F.R.D. 351 (1960). † Manual for Complex Litigation, Second, at 2 (1985). ‡ See, e.g., Fed.

See also Rule 16(c), listing subjects for consideration and action by the court at a pretrial conference, and generally the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. §§ 471–482."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv Manual for Complex Litigation, Third moved from the cutting edge into the mainstream of litigation. What this manual offers is less novelty than update and refinement—collection and analysis of ex - perience in the management of litigation, translation of generalized concepts into specific techniques and practices, and application of case management to newly emerging problems in complex litigation. At the same time, the Manual Third also speaks to the continuing need for innovation and creativity. The Manual Third builds on the earlier editions and, indeed, retains the or - ganization and most of the substance of the Manual Second . The work of the Board of Editors of the Manual Second , headed by Chief Judge Sam C. Pointer, Jr., remains a foundation for this manual. The innovative and constructive work of the many judges and practitioners who contributed to the earlier works con - tinues to enrich the Manual . It also benefits from the contributions of numerous judges, academics, and practicing attorneys who provided new material, assisted in drafting revisions, and critically reviewed and commented on drafts. This project was carried out by staff of the Federal Judicial Center pursuant to the Center’s statutory mission “to further the development and adoption of im - proved judicial administration in the courts of the United States.” Significant contributions were made by Jon Heller, Esq., of the New York Bar, law clerk to the director during this project, and by Thomas E. Willging, senior research as - sociate, and Laural L. Hooper, research associate. The views expressed are not necessarily those of the Center or its Board. As always, the Center welcomes comments and suggestions from readers. William W Schwarzer, Director Federal Judicial Center December 1994 Note: As this edition goes to press, bills are pending in Congress that could im - pact, in ways not now predictable, various aspects of complex litigation—in par - ticular securities, product liability, and certain types of civil rights litigation."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Part I: Introduction"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"3 10. Purpose and Use of the Manual .1 Purpose of the Manual 3 .2 Use of the Manual 5 .3 Other Publications on Litigation Management 6 10.1 Purpose of the Manual The purpose of this manual is to assist in the management of complex litigation. Although the roles of judges and lawyers differ, they share the responsibility for managing complex litigation in which they are involved. Judges must look to lawyers to conduct the litigation in a professional manner and to assist them, not only by advising them on the facts and the law of the case, but also by submitting fair, practical, and effective proposals for the management of the litigation and by making management succeed. At a time when the demands on the time of judges weigh heavily, judges are more dependent on lawyers than ever in striving to achieve the purpose of Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Lawyers in turn must look to judges for clear directions, timely decisions, and firm control when needed to effectuate case management. This manual is therefore directed at both groups. What is complex litigation? The original manual defined complex litigation as including “one or more related cases which present unusual problems and . . . re - quire extraordinary treatment, including but not limited to the cases designated as ‘protracted’ and ‘big.’” The Manual for Complex Litigation, Second dropped this elusive description but made no effort to arrive at a substitute. Yet a definition is important to understanding the objective of this manual, for there is always a risk that complexity may be introduced simply by calling litigation “complex.” A functional definition of complex litigation recognizes that the need for management in the sense used here—judicial management with the participation of counsel—does not simply arise from complexity, but is its defining character - istic: The greater the need for management, the more “complex” is the litigation. Clearly, litigation involving many parties in numerous related cases—especially if pending in different jurisdictions—requires management and is complex, as is litigation involving large numbers of witnesses and documents and extensive dis - covery. On the other hand, litigation raising difficult and novel questions of law, though challenging to the court, may require little or no management, and therefore may not be complex as that term is used here. How does the manual aid management? Management is not an end in itself. It must be conducted to serve its purpose of bringing about “the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination” of the litigation, avoiding unnecessary and unpro - ductive activity. The manual provides an arsenal of litigation management tech -"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third niques or, perhaps more accurately, a kit of management tools that have proved effective in the past, from which the participants should select those useful for the particular circumstances. Some of what this manual contains will be appropriate in only a few cases, while other material will have much wider application. This reflects the fact that it is neither practical nor helpful to attempt to draw a bright line between complex litigation and other litigation. Different cases will have dif - ferent management needs. Even the most widely accepted and effective manage - ment techniques have little utility if in the particular litigation they are not needed—and suitable—to help control cost and delay fairly. In offering an array of litigation management techniques and procedures, the manual does not recommend that every litigation necessarily use any of them or follow a standard pattern. The techniques and procedures suitable for one litiga - tion will not necessarily be suitable for another. Choices will depend on the needs of the litigation and many other considerations. What the manual does urge is that choices be made, and that they be made starting early in the litigation, lest it drift for lack of decisions about its management. While those decisions are largely the responsibility of the judge, their purpose is not to take the case from the lawyers but to provide guidance and direction, setting limits and applying con - trols as needed. Although much of what this manual contains is transubstantive, complex liti - gation should not be viewed as monolithic. Substantive law in the different areas in which complex litigation is pursued shapes procedure and management as well. In some areas of law, such as antitrust and securities litigation, substantive and procedural rules are relatively well settled, as are management techniques. In others, such as environmental, civil rights, and mass tort litigation, they are still emerging or undergoing change. While all complex litigation challenges courts, the latter areas present the greatest challenges, requiring courts to adapt proce - dures designed for the adjudication of one-on-one disputes in a discrete forum to litigation with many parties on both sides and related cases pending in different courts, often including state courts. Much complex litigation, therefore, will take the judge and counsel into sparsely charted terrain with little guidance on how to respond to pressing needs for management. Practices and principles that served in the past may not be ade - quate, their adaptation may be difficult and controversial, and novel and innova - tive ways may have to be found. 1 While this manual should be helpful within the limits of its mission, it should be viewed as open ended, and judges are encour - aged to be innovative and creative to meet the needs of their cases, though re - maining mindful of the bounds of existing law. 1 . See, e.g., American Law Institute, Complex Litigation Project (1993); American Bar Association, Revised Final Report and Recommendations of the Commission on Mass Torts (1989)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Purpose and Use of the Manual 5 This manual retains, in substantially expanded form, a chapter on complex criminal litigation. It does so because the manual is a convenient vehicle to pro - vide material thought to be helpful to judges and lawyers concerned with criminal litigation, at least until a separate criminal manual is published. Although it is indisputable that complex criminal litigation has been increasing, there is, as in civil litigation, no bright line dividing complex cases from the rest. Some of the material, though relevant to complex litigation, may also be considered useful for criminal case management generally. For the most part, the problems of criminal litigation are unique and the generic portions of this manual have only limited application; where they do apply, cross-references have been supplied. 10.2 Use of the Manual While this edition contains much new and revised material, it follows the format and retains the numbering system of the Manual for Complex Litigation, Second . This manual is divided into four parts. Part I contains a brief description of the purpose and use of the manual. Part II, “Management of Complex Litigation,” discusses basic principles of effective management of complex litigation and then describes various procedures for their implementation as the litigation moves through the pretrial phase—issue definition, discovery, motion practice, and preparation for trial—and to summary disposition, settlement, or trial. Part III discusses the application of management techniques and procedures to particular types of complex civil and criminal litigation. The reader interested in a particular kind of action may wish to begin by reviewing the applicable sections in this part before consulting the generic material in Part II. Part IV contains litigation checklists and sample orders and forms. The organization of this manual belies the fact that its subject matter is not neatly divisible into distinct topics. A topic, such as settlement or class actions, will be relevant to the discussion at different points in the manual. To minimize repetition, the manual generally discusses a topic at a single logical location, but provides extensive cross-references throughout the text. The reader is urged to make liberal use of these, as well as the checklists in section 40, to ensure that all relevant matter is accessed. The manual is offered as an aid to management, not as a treatise on matters of substantive or procedural law. Footnotes have been expanded to provide the reader with a convenient starting point for research where needed, but the text cannot be assumed to remain a current and comprehensive statement of the law. Nor is the manual intended for citation as authority on points of law or as a statement of official policy.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Rules 16, 26, 37, 42, and 83, contain nu - merous grants of authority that supplement the court’s inherent power 2 to man - age litigation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(12) specifically addresses complex litigation, authorizing the judge to adopt “special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual proof problems.” In planning and implementing case management, its purpose must be kept in mind. Case management is not an end in itself; rather it is intended to bring about a just resolution as speedily and inexpensively as possible. It should be tai - lored to the needs of the particular litigation and to the resources available; make - work activity should be avoided. Those resources include not only those of the parties but also those of the judicial system. Judicial time is the scarcest of these, and an important part of case management is for judges to use their time wisely and efficiently and to make use of all available help. Time pressures may lead some judges to think that they cannot afford to devote time to civil case manage - ment. It is true that the extra attention given by the judge to a complex case can encroach upon the time immediately available to attend to other matters. But judges have found that an investment of time in case management in the early stages of the litigation will lead to earlier dispositions, less wasteful activity, shorter trials, and, in the long run, to economies of judicial time and a lessening of judicial burdens. 2 .

Ct. 2123, 2132–37 (1991)."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"General Principles 11 20.11 Early Identification and Control Judicial supervision is most needed and productive early in the litigation. To this end, an initial pretrial conference under Rule 16 3 should be held as soon as prac - tical (many judges hold the conference within 30 to 60 days of filing), even if some parties have not yet appeared or even been served. Rule 16(b) requires that the judge, usually after holding a scheduling conference, issue a scheduling or der 4 “as soon as practicable but in any event within 90 days after the appearance of a defendant and within 120 days after the complaint has been served on a de- fendant” (local rules may establish different deadlines). The initial pretrial con - ference may be used for this purpose unless a separate scheduling conference is thought to be needed. Many judges use standing case orders—sometimes tailored to specific types of litigation—to elicit specific information prior to the confer - ence and inform counsel of the matters they must be prepared to discuss. 5 The assigned judge should therefore be alerted as soon as possible to the filing of a potentially complex case. Some courts require the clerk’s office to notify the judge immediately of the filing of certain types of cases—such as class actions and mass tort, antitrust, and securities fraud cases—that typically merit special judi - cial attention. Courts often require that a civil cover sheet be filed with the com - plaint indicating, among other things, whether a case should be considered “complex.” Whether a case will require increased judicial supervision, however, may not be apparent from the docket sheet or the complaint itself. Counsel should be directed to notify the court of the filing of a potentially complex case and identify by name and court all pending cases (state and federal) that may be related; many courts require this by local rule. 20.12 Assignment to Single Judge .121 Recusal/Disqualification 12 .122 Other Judges 13 .123 Related Litigation 13 Each multijudge court should determine for itself whether complex litigation should be assigned according to the court’s regular plan for case assignment, un - der a special rotation for complex cases, or perhaps to one or more judges par - ticularly qualified by reason of experience.

In unusual situations, the demands of complex liti - gation may be so great that the assigned judge should be relieved from some or all other case assignments for a period of time or be given assistance on aspects of the litigation from other judges. 20.121 Recusal/Disqualification The judge to whom a complex case is assigned (or has been reassigned) should promptly review the pleadings and other papers in the case, the identities of par - ties and attorneys, and the nature of interests affected by the litigation for possible conflicts that may require recusal or disqualification. 6 To assist the judge, counsel should submit a list of all entities affiliated with the parties and all attorneys and firms associated in the litigation. This review must be conducted at the out set, but the court needs to consider both present and potential conflicts that may arise as a result of the joinder of additional parties, the identification of class members, or the assignment of other related cases, with the accompanying in volvement of additional litigants and counsel. 7 As the case progresses, the court should remain alert to conflicts that may arise as additional persons and interests enter the litigation or as the judge’s staff changes. 8 A judicial officer is required to recuse (1) in any proceeding in which the officer’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” 9 or (2) if any of the conflicts of interest enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 455(b) exist. Where the ground for disqualification arises under the former provision only, the parties may waive it after full disclosure on the record; the conflicts of interest enumerated in § 455(b) may not be waived. 10 Where the officer has devoted “substantial judicial time” to a matter, however, disqualification based on a financial interest in a party (other 6 .

Moreover, in the course of consolidated or coordinated pre - trial proceedings, severable claims or cases may appear that could be assigned to other judges. 20.123 Related Litigation Complex litigation frequently involves two or more separate but related cases. All related cases pending or which may later be filed in the same court, whether or not in the same division, should be assigned at least initially to the same judge (local rules often provide for the assignment of related cases to a single judge, typically the judge receiving assignment of the earliest-filed case). Pretrial pro- ceedings in these cases should be coordinated or consolidated under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), even if filed in more than one division of the court. 12 It may be neces sary to transfer to the district judge related adversary proceedings in bankruptcy, including proceedings to determine the dischargeability of debts. 13 Counsel should be directed to inform the assigned judge of any pending related cases (as many local rules require); related cases may be identified on the face of the com - plaint. The judge to whom complex litigation has been assigned should also at - tempt to ascertain whether related cases are pending in the judge’s court. Assignment of related criminal and civil cases to a single judge will improve efficiency and coordination, especially when the cases are pending at the same time. Other factors, however, such as the possibility that extensive judicial super - vision of pretrial proceedings in the civil litigation may be needed during the time the criminal trial is being conducted, may suggest that the cases be handled by different judges. See generally infra section 31.2. Consolidation may be possible even when related cases are filed in different courts. Cases in other districts may be capable of being transferred under 28 11 . Id. § 455(f). 12 . Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(b) the court may, upon motion, transfer cases pending in the same district, or motions or hearings therein, to a single division. 13 .

Litig., 730 F.2d 1128 (8th Cir. 1984)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third U.S.C. § 1404(a) or 1406 14 to the consolidation court by the court in which they are pending. Pretrial proceedings in related cases may also be consolidated in a single district by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation under 28 U.S.C. § 1407. See infra section 31.13. Cases brought in state court may be removed to federal court 15 and transferred, or refiled in the consolidating district court following voluntary dismissal or dismissal based on forum non conveniens . When transfer of all cases to a single court for centralized management is not possible, the affected courts should attempt to coordinate proceedings through informal means to the extent practicable in order to minimize conflicts, inconsis - tent rulings, and duplication of effort. Coordination can be accomplished by ar - rangements made by counsel, appropriate communications between judges, joint pretrial conferences and hearings at which both judges preside, and the issuance of parallel orders. It may be facilitated by designation of a “lead” case in the liti - gation; rulings in the lead case would presumptively apply to the other coordi - nated cases, and pretrial proceedings in those cases may be stayed pending its resolution. Coordination of related litigation is discussed more fully in infra sec - tion 31.14 (cases in different federal courts) and infra section 31.31 (cases in fed - eral and state courts). 20.13 Effective Management Effective judicial management generally has the following characteristics: • It is active. The judge attempts to anticipate problems before they arise rather than waiting passively for matters to be presented by counsel. Because the attorneys may become immersed in the details of the case, innovation and creativity in formulating a litigation plan may frequently depend on the court. • It is substantive. The judge’s involvement is not limited to procedural matters. Rather, the judge becomes familiar at an early stage with the substantive issues in order to make informed rulings on issue definition and narrowing, and on related matters, such as scheduling, bifurcation and consolidation, and discovery control. • It is timely. The judge decides disputes promptly, particularly those that may substantially affect the course or scope of further proceedings. Delayed rulings may be costly and burdensome for litigants and will often 14 . These statutes authorize such transfer only if personal jurisdiction and venue lie in the transferee court. See, e.g. , Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 24 (3d Cir. 1970) (§ 1404(a)); Dubin v. United States, 380 F.2d 813 (5th Cir. 1967) (§ 1406). If they do not, transfer is improper even if plaintiffs consent. Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U.S. 335 (1960). 15 . See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441–1452."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"General Principles 15 delay other litigation events. Sometimes the parties may prefer that a ruling be timely rather than perfect. • It is continuing. The judge periodically monitors the progress of the liti - gation to see that schedules are being followed and to consider necessary modifications of the litigation plan. The judge may call for interim re - ports between scheduled conferences. • It is firm, but fair. Time limits and other controls and requirements are not imposed arbitrarily or without considering the views of counsel, and they are subject to revision when warranted by the circumstances. Once having established a program, however, the judge expects schedules to be met and, when necessary, imposes appropriate sanctions (see infra sec - tion 20.15) for derelictions and dilatory tactics. • It is carefully prepared. Heavy-handed case management by an unpre - pared judge may often be counterproductive, while an early display of careful preparation sets the proper tone and can enhance the judge’s credibility and effectiveness with counsel. The judge’s role in developing and monitoring an effective plan for the or - derly conduct of pretrial and trial proceedings is crucial. Although the elements and details of the plan will vary with the circumstances of the particular case, each plan must include an appropriate schedule under which the case is to proceed to resolution. Ordinarily, the plan should prescribe a series of procedural steps with firm dates giving direction and order to the case as it progresses through pretrial proceedings to summary disposition or trial. In some cases, the court may be able to establish an overall plan for the conduct of the litigation at the outset; in oth - ers, the plan must be developed and refined in successive stages. The more pru - dent course is to err on the side of over-inclusiveness in the plan rather than risk omission of critical elements; components of the plan that prove impractical may always be modified. Time limits and deadlines will often be necessary for effective case management, though a firm but realistic trial date, coupled with immediate access to the court in the event a dispute cannot be resolved by agreement among counsel, may suffice in litigation involving experienced attorneys working coop - eratively. The attorneys—who will be more familiar than the judge with the facts and issues in the case—should play a significant part in developing the litigation plan and are primarily responsible for its execution. The judge should provide super - vision and maintain control in a manner that recognizes the burdens placed on counsel by complex litigation, and he or she should foster mutual respect and co - operation not only between the court and the attorneys but also among the attor - neys."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 20.14 Supervisory Referrals to Magistrate Judges and Special Masters The judge should decide early in the litigation whether to refer all or any part of pretrial supervision and control to a magistrate judge. In making that decision, the judge needs to consider a number of factors, including the experience and qualifications of the available magistrate judge, the relationship and attitude of the attorneys, the extent to which a district judge’s authority may be required, the time the judge has to devote to the litigation, the novelty of the issues presented and the need for innovation, and the judge’s personal preferences. Some judges believe that judicial supervision of complex litigation should ordinarily be exer - cised directly by them rather than by a magistrate judge, even in courts that rou - tinely make such referrals for discovery or other pretrial purposes. They believe that referrals in complex cases may cause additional costs and delays when the parties seek review by the judge, weaken the impact of directions given to counsel during pretrial proceedings, diminish supervisory consistency and coherence as the case proceeds to trial, create greater reluctance to try innovative procedures that might aid in resolution of the case, and cause the judge to be unfamiliar with the case at the time of trial. Other judges have found that magistrate judges have the competence, experience, and authority to be able to provide effective case management during the pretrial stage, enabling the judge to devote time to more urgent matters. Even if no general referral is made to a magistrate judge, referral of particular matters may be helpful. The judge may refer supervision of all discovery matters, or supervision of particular discovery issues or disputes, particularly those that may be time consuming or require an immediate ruling; examples include resolv - ing deposition disputes by telephone, ruling on claims of privilege and motions for protective orders, and conducting hearings on procedural matters, such as personal jurisdiction. Magistrate judges may also be called on to assist counsel with formulation of stipulations and statements of contentions, and to facilitate settlement discussions. The law of the circuit should be consulted with respect to the limits on referrals to magistrate judges. See generally infra section 21.53. Referral of pretrial management to a special master (not a magistrate judge) is not advisable. Rule 53 permits referrals only in “exceptional cases,” and because pretrial management calls for the exercise of judicial authority, its exercise by someone other than a judicial officer is particularly inappropriate. 16 Moreover the additional expense imposed on parties as a result militates strongly against such 16 . See LaBuy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249 (1957) (the length and complexity of a case and the congestion of the court’s docket do not alone justify a comprehensive reference to a special master). See infra § 21.52."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"General Principles 17 appointment. 17 Appointment of a special master (or of an expert under Fed. R. Evid. 706) for limited purposes requiring special expertise may sometimes be appropriate (e.g., when a complex program for settlement needs to be de vised). 18 See infra sections 21.51–21.52. Any referral should be covered by an order that specifically describes what is being referred, the authority being delegated to the magistrate judge or master, and the procedure for review by the judge. The court should call for regular progress reports from the magistrate judge or master. 20.15 Sanctions .151 General Principles 17 .152 Sources of Authority 18 .153 Considerations in Imposing 19 .154 Types 20 .155 Procedure 23 20.151 General Principles The rules and principles governing the imposition of sanctions are the same in complex as in other litigation, but the potential of sanctions requires careful at - tention in complex litigation because misconduct may have more severe conse - quences. Because the litigation will generally be conducted under close judicial oversight and control, there should be fewer opportunities for sanctionable con - duct to occur. If the court’s management program is clear, specific, and reason - able—having been developed with the participation of counsel—the parties will know what is expected of them and should have little difficulty complying. The occasions for sanctionable conduct will therefore be reduced. Indeed, the need to resort to sanctions may reflect a breakdown of case management. On the other hand, the stakes involved in and the pressures generated by complex litigation may lead some parties to violate the rules. Although as a general matter sanctions should not be a means of management, the court needs to make clear its willing - ness to resort to sanctions, sua sponte if necessary, to assure compliance with the management program. 19 The design of the case management program should anticipate compliance problems and include prophylactic procedures, such as requiring parties to meet 17 .

In addition, the court should inform counsel at the outset of the litigation of the court’s expectations about cooperation and professionalism. Perceptions of the limits of legitimate advocacy differ; advance guidance from the court can reduce the need for sanctions later. Though at times unavoidable, sanctions should be considered a last resort. The court should exercise its discretion with care and explain on the record or in an order the basis for its action and the purpose to be achieved. Sanctions may be imposed for general or specific deterrence, to punish, or to remedy the conse - quences of misconduct. Sanctions proceedings can be disruptive, costly, and may create personal an - tagonism inimical to an atmosphere of cooperation. Counsel should therefore avoid moving for sanctions unless all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted. 20.152 Sources of Authority The primary codified sources of authority to impose sanctions in civil litigation are 28 U.S.C. § 1927 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, 16, 41, and 56(g). 20 Sanctions relat ing to discovery are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, 30, 32(d), 33(b)(3)–(4), 34(b), 35(b)(1), 36(a), and, most prominently, Rule 37. 21 Under limited cir cumstances sanctions may also be imposed under local rules. 22 Sanctions may also be imposed through the exercise of the court’s inherent powers. 23 The court may resort to this power even where the conduct at issue could be sanctioned under a statute or rule; the court should, however, avoid re - sort to its inherent power if the statute or rule is directly applicable and adequate to support the intended sanction. 24 The court may assess attorneys’ fees pur suant to its inherent power, but when sitting in diversity should avoid doing so in 20 . A number of federal statutes allow the court, in its discretion, to award prevailing parties costs, including attorneys’ and sometimes experts’ fees. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 1988, 2000e-5(k) (West Supp. 1993); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78i(e), 78r(a). Such statutes may expressly predicate such an award on a finding that the action (or defense) was meritless, see, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 77k(e), and common law may impose the same requirement when awards under such statutes are sought by defendants. See Christansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 416 (1978). But see Fogerty v. Fantasy Inc., 62 U.S.L.W. 4153 & 4155 n.12 (U.S. March 1, 1994) (same standard applies to plaintiffs and defendants seeking fees in copyright, patent, and trademark cases). Such awards may therefore be considered a sanction for meritless litigation. 21 . Note that Rule 11 is expressly made inapplicable to discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(d). 22 . See, e.g., Rule 11.1 of the Local Rules for Civil Cases, E.D. Mich.; Miranda v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., 710 F.2d 516 (9th Cir. 1983). 23 . See Chambers , 111 S.

For example, 28 U.S.C. § 1927 authorizes the assessment of costs and fees against an attorney only—it therefore cannot provide authority to impose sanctions on a party. 20.153 Considerations in Imposing In considering the imposition of sanctions, the judge should take these factors into account: • the nature and consequences of the dereliction or misconduct; • the person(s) responsible; • the court’s discretion under the applicable source of authority to impose sanctions and to choose which sanctions to impose; • the purposes to be served by imposing sanctions, and what is the least se - vere sanction that will achieve the intended purpose; and • the appropriate time for conducting sanctions proceedings. With respect to the consideration of the nature and consequences of the dereliction or misconduct, the court should take these factors into account: • whether the act or omission was willful or negligent; • whether it directly violated a court order or a federal or local rule; • its effect on the litigation and the trial participants; • whether it was isolated or part of a course of misconduct or derelic tion; 26 and • the existence of any extenuating circumstances. Rule 11 substantially limits the authority of the court to impose monetary sanctions, but they may still be available in unusual cases or under other rules or powers. If monetary sanctions are warranted, they should generally be imposed only on the person(s) responsible for the misconduct; if assessed against counsel, they should be accompanied by a direction not to pass the cost on to the client. It may be appropriate to sanction the client or the client and attorney jointly. If the proper allocation of responsibility between counsel and client is unclear, its de - 25 . Chambers , 111 S.

They should be im posed only in egregious circumstances and only after consideration of the follow ing factors: • the policy favoring trial on the merits; • whether the sanction will further the just, speedy, and inexpensive de - termination of the action; • the degree to which the sanctioned party acted deliberately and knew or should have known of the possible consequences; • the degree of responsibility of the affected client; • the merits and importance of the claim(s) affected; • the impact on other parties or the public interest; and • the availability of less severe sanctions to accomplish the intended pur - pose. 20.154 Types In imposing the least severe sanction adequate to accomplish the intended pur - pose, the court can select from a broad range of options. 31 These include the following: • Reprimand. For most minor violations, particularly a first infraction, an oral reprimand will suffice. In more serious cases, a written reprimand may be appropriate. 27 . See Healy v.

See generally infra section 21.433. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1927, Fed. R. Civ.

The court may decline to award otherwise re - coverable attorneys’ fees and expenses, or order counsel not to charge them to their client, when incurred through dilatory or otherwise im - proper conduct, or in proceedings brought on by such conduct. • Remedial action. Counsel and parties may be required to remedy a negli - gent or wrongful act at their own expense, as by reconstructing materials improperly destroyed or erased. • Grant/denial of time. Improper delay may justify awarding opposing parties additional time for discovery or other matters, 33 or denying oth - erwise proper requests for extension of time. More serious sanctions, reserved for egregious circumstances, include the following: • Demotion/removal of counsel. An attorney may be removed from a po - sition as lead, liaison, or class counsel, or (in an extreme case) from fur - ther participation in the case entirely. Such a sanction, however, is likely to disrupt the litigation, may cause significant harm to the client’s case and the reputation of the attorney or law firm, and can conflict with a party’s right to counsel of its choosing. • Removal of party as class representative. Before imposing this sanction, the court should consider ordering that notice be given to the class under Rule 23(d)(2) to enable them to express their views concerning their rep - resentation or intervene in the action. 34 • Enjoining party from commencing other litigation. While there is a strong policy against denying access to the courts, a party may be en - joined from commencing other actions until it has complied with all or - ders in the current action, or from bringing, without court approval, other actions involving the same or similar facts or claims. 32 .

This severe sanction should generally not be imposed until the affected party has been warned and given a chance to take remedial ac - tion, and then only when lesser sanctions, such as dismissal without prej - udice and assessment of costs, would be ineffective. • Vacation of judgment.

Where the misconduct rises to the level of a criminal offense, 43 the matter may be referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. 20.155 Procedure The appropriate timing for the imposition of sanctions depends on the basis for their imposition. Generally sanctions are most effective when imposed promptly after the improper conduct has occurred. 44 This maximizes their deterrent effect in the litigation. Prompt imposition also allows the court to try to deal with the problem by imposing less severe sanctions before resorting to more severe mea - sures should they become necessary. Some sanctions, however, depend for their predicate on further proceedings. The frivolous nature of a paper may not be established until further action by the court. Some misconduct or the extent of its consequences may not become ap - parent until the litigation has developed further; some sanctions are expressly conditioned on later developments. 45 Certain facts may have to be established before the court can decide the sanctions issue, a process which may delay the litigation unless deferred until its conclusion. Similarly, as discussed above, defer - ral is advisable where the decision may require inquiry into potentially privileged communications and create a conflict of interest between counsel and client. Delaying rulings on sanctions may allow the court to consider the issue more dis - passionately; the court must be careful, however, not to apply the wisdom of hindsight. Sanctions should not be assessed without notice and an opportunity to be heard. 46 The extent of the process afforded, however, depends on the circum - stances, primarily the type and severity of sanction under consideration. 47 An oral or evidentiary hearing may not be necessary for relatively minor sanctions; the issue may be decided on papers. 48 To provide notice when acting sua sponte , the court should issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be im posed, 43 .

The added demands and burdens of complex litigation place a premium on professionalism. 54 An attitude by counsel of cooperation, professional courtesy, and acceptance of the obligations owed as officers of the court is critical to suc - cessful management of the litigation. Counsel need to perform their obligations as advocates in a manner that will foster and sustain good working relations among themselves and with the court. They need to communicate constructively and civilly with one another and attempt to resolve disputes informally as much as possible. Even where the stakes are high, counsel should avoid unnecessary contentiousness and limit the controversy to material issues genuinely in dis- pute. 55 The certification requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and 26(g) reflect some of the attorneys’ obligations as officers of the court. By presenting a paper to the court, an attorney certifies that “to the best of the person’s knowledge, informa - tion, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances . . . it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.” 56 An attorney’s signature on discovery requests, responses, and objections certifies that they are not “unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.” 57 These provisions imple ment a policy of having attorneys “stop and think” before taking action. 54 .

Traditional procedures in which all papers and doc- uments are served on all attorneys, and each attorney files motions, presents ar - guments, and conducts witness examinations, may result in waste of time and money, in confusion and indirection, and in unnecessary burden on the court. Special procedures for coordination of counsel are therefore needed and should be instituted early in the litigation to avoid unnecessary costs and duplicative ac - tivity. In some cases the attorneys coordinate their activities without the court’s as - sistance to eliminate duplication of effort, and they should be encouraged to do so. More often, however, the court will need to institute procedures under which one or more attorneys are selected and authorized to act on behalf of other coun - sel and their clients with respect to specified aspects of the litigation. To do so, the court should invite submissions and suggestions from all counsel and conduct an independent review (usually a hearing is advisable) to ensure that counsel ap - pointed to leading roles are qualified and responsible, that they will fairly and ad - equately represent all of the parties on their side, and that their charges will be reasonable. 58 Counsel designated by the court should be reminded of their re- sponsibility to the court and their obligation to act fairly, efficiently, and econom - ically in the interests of all parties and their counsel. 20.221 Organizational Structures Attorneys designated by the court to act in the litigation on behalf of other coun - sel and parties in addition to their own clients (referred to collectively as “designated counsel”) generally fall into one of the following categories: 58 . In cases where the court may award or approve fees, or where court-designated counsel are entitled to compensation, the court should be aware of the importance of controlling attorneys’ fees from the outset and the need to adopt appropriate procedures to that end. See infra § 24.2. Some courts have developed innovative approaches—for example, competitive bidding has been used in securities fraud actions to select lead class counsel and determine the basis for their compensation. See In re Wells Fargo Sec. Litig., 156 F.R.D. 223, 157 F.R.D. 467 (N.D. Cal. 1994); In re Oracle Sec. Litig., 131 F.R.D. 688, 132 F.R.D. 538 (N.D. Cal. 1990)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"General Principles 27 • Liaison counsel : charged with essentially administrative matters, such as communications between the court and other counsel (including receiv - ing and distributing notices, orders, motions, and briefs on behalf of the group), convening meetings of counsel, advising parties of developments in the case, and otherwise assisting in the coordination of activities and positions. Such counsel may act for the group in managing document depositories and in resolving scheduling conflicts. Liaison counsel will usually have offices in the same locality as the court. 59 • Lead counsel : charged with major responsibility for formulating (after consultation with other counsel) and presenting positions on substantive and procedural issues during the litigation. Typically they act for the group—either personally or by coordinating the efforts of others—in presenting written and oral arguments and suggestions to the court, working with opposing counsel in developing and implementing a litiga - tion plan, initiating and organizing discovery requests and responses, conducting the principal examination of deponents, employing experts, arranging for support services, and seeing that schedules are met. • Trial counsel : serves as principal attorney for the group at trial in presenting arguments, making objections, conducting examination of witnesses, and generally organizing and coordinating the work of the other attor neys on the trial team. • Committees of counsel : often called steering committees, coordinating committees, management committees, executive committees, discovery committees, or trial teams—may be formed to serve a wide range of functions. Because the appointment of committees of counsel can lead to substantially increased costs, they should not be made unless needed; a need is most likely to exist in cases in which the interests and positions of group members are sufficiently dissimilar to justify giving them represen - tation in decision making. Committees may be assigned tasks by the court or lead counsel, such as preparing briefs or conducting portions of the discovery program, but should not be formed to accomplish tasks that one lawyer can perform adequately. Great care must be taken, how - ever, to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts and to control fees and expenses. See infra section 24.21 on controlling attorneys’ fees. The types of appointments and assignments of responsibilities will depend on many factors, the most important of which is achieving efficiency and economy 59 . The court may appoint (or the parties may select) a liaison for each side, and, if their func- tions are strictly limited to administrative matters, they need not be attorneys. See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 1989 WL 168401, at *19–20 (defining duties of “liaison persons” for plaintiffs and defendants)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third without jeopardizing fairness to parties in the litigation. Depending on the num - ber and complexity of different interests represented, both lead and liaison coun - sel may be appointed for one side, with only liaison counsel appointed for the other. The roles of liaison, lead, and trial counsel may be filled by one attorney or by several. The functions of lead counsel may be divided among several attorneys, but the number should not be so large as to defeat the purpose of making such appointments. 20.222 Powers and Responsibilities The functions of lead, liaison, and trial counsel, and of each committee, should be stated in either a court order or a separate document drafted by counsel and re - viewed and approved by the court. 60 This writing will inform other counsel and parties of the scope of authority conferred on designated counsel and define re - sponsibilities within the group. It will usually be impractical and unwise, how - ever, to spell out in detail the functions assigned or to specify the particular deci - sions that may be made unilaterally by designated counsel and those that may be made only with the concurrence of an affected party. To avoid controversy over the interpretation of the terms of the court’s appointment order, designated counsel should seek consensus among the attorneys (and any unrepresented par - ties) when making decisions that may have a critical impact on the litigation. Counsel selected for a position of leadership have an obligation to keep the other attorneys in the group advised of the progress of the litigation and consult them about decisions significantly affecting their clients. Counsel must use their judgment about this communication: too much may defeat the objectives of efficiency and economy, while too little may prejudice the interests of the parties. Communication among the various counsel on one side and their respective clients should not be treated as waiving work-product protection or the attorney – client privilege, and a specific court order on the point may be helpful. 61 Judgment should also be exercised in dealing with disputes within the group, or indeed within a committee of counsel. An effort should first be made to achieve consensus, but if such an effort fails, members of the group may have to proceed on the matter individually or by subgroups. Individual action in particu - lar may be necessary in connection with the examination of witnesses—examina - tion in depositions or at trial by lead counsel should not preclude nonduplicative examination by another attorney with respect to matters peculiar to that attor - ney’s client. Designated counsel may be in an advantageous position to initiate, conduct, and evaluate settlement discussions for the group, since the designated counsel 60 . See Sample Order infra § 41.31. 61 .

Here they must be aware, however, of the limits of their authority to act on behalf of the group and of the potential for conflict between the interests of their clients and those of others in the group. Designated counsel should not bind the group without specific authority; nor should they, without court authorization, allow settlement discussions to interfere with their respon - sibility to move the litigation to trial on schedule. Because a serious problem can be created by offers of partial settlement made to clients of designated attorneys playing key roles in the conduct of the litigation, those attorneys must understand that their responsibilities in the litigation extend beyond the resolution of their own clients’ involvement. 20.223 Compensation Expenses incurred and fees earned by designated counsel acting in that capacity should not be borne solely by their clients, but rather shared equitably by all benefiting from their services. If possible, the terms and procedures for payment should be established by agreement among counsel, but subject to judicial ap - proval and control (see infra section 24.214, compensation for designated coun - sel). Whether or not agreement is reached, the judge has the authority to order reimbursement and compensation and the obligation to ensure that the amounts are reasonable. 62 Terms and procedures should be established before substantial services are rendered and should provide for, among other things, the following: periodic billings during the litigation or creation of a fund through advance or ongoing assessments of members of the group; appropriate contributions from parties making partial settlements with respect to services already rendered by designated counsel; and contributions from parties in later filed or assigned cases who benefit from the earlier work of designated counsel. Designated counsel should render services as economically as possible under the circumstances, avoiding unnecessary activity and limiting the number of per - sons attending conferences and depositions and working on briefs and other tasks. The court should make clear at the first pretrial conference that compensa - tion will not be approved for unnecessary or duplicative activities or services.

Because of the stakes involved, competi - tion for appointment is often intense, and judges need to be prepared to manage it appropriately. Appointment by the court will often be prized for the promise of large fees and a prominent role in the litigation. Negotiations and arrangements among attorneys of which the judge is not made aware may have a significant ef - fect on positions taken in the proceedings. At the same time, because appoint - ment of designated counsel will alter the usual dynamics of client representation in important ways, attorneys will have legitimate concerns that their clients’ in - terests be adequately represented. For these reasons, the judge needs to take an active part in making the deci - sion on the appointment of counsel. Deferring to proposals by counsel without independent examination by the court, even those that seem to have the concur - rence of a “majority” of those affected, invites problems down the road when designated counsel may turn out to be unwilling or unable to discharge their re - sponsibilities in a manner satisfactory to the court or when excessive costs are in - curred. The court should take the time necessary to make an assessment of the qualifications, functions, organization, and compensation of designated counsel. The court should satisfy itself that full disclosure has been made of all agreements and understandings among counsel, that the attorneys to be designated are com - petent for their assignments, that clear and satisfactory guidelines have been es - tablished for compensation and reimbursement, and that the arrangements for coordination among counsel are fair, reasonable, and efficient. The court should also ensure that designated counsel fairly represent the various interests in the litigation; where diverse interests exist among the parties, the court may designate a committee of counsel representing different interests. Attorneys should not be appointed or approved by the court to serve as des - ignated counsel unless they have the resources, the commitment, and the qualifications to accomplish the assigned tasks. They should be able to command the respect of their colleagues and work cooperatively with opposing counsel and the court. Prior experience in similar roles in other litigation may be useful, but past performance may also demonstrate that an attorney may have generated per - sonal antagonisms that will undermine effectiveness in the present case or is oth - 63 .

Though these records may be filed under seal, the court should monitor them to determine that they are within the range of appropriate expenditure of time and expense."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"General Principles 31 erwise ill-suited for the contemplated assignment. Although the court should move expeditiously and avoid unnecessary delay, an evidentiary hearing may be needed to bring all relevant facts to light, or to allow counsel to state their case for appointment and answer questions from the court about their qualifications (the court may call for the submission of résumés and other relevant information). Such a hearing is particularly appropriate when the court is unfamiliar with the attorneys seeking appointment. The court should inquire as to normal or antici - pated billing rates, define record-keeping requirements, and establish guidelines, methods, or limitations to govern the award of fees. 64 While it may be appro - priate and possibly even beneficial for several firms to divide work among them - selves, 65 the court should satisfy itself that such an appointment is necessary and not simply the result of a bargain among the attorneys. 66 The court’s responsibilities are heightened in class action litigation, where the judge must approve counsel for the class (see infra section 30.16). In litigation in - volving both class and individual claims, class and individual counsel will need to coordinate. 20.225 Related Litigation If related litigation is pending in other federal or state courts, the judges should consider the feasibility of coordination among counsel in the various cases. See infra sections 31.14 and 31.31. It may be possible through consultation with other judges to bring about the designation of common committees or of counsel and to enter joint or parallel orders governing their function and compensation. 67 Where that is not feasible, the judge may direct counsel to coordinate with the attorneys involved in the other cases to reduce duplication and potential conflicts and to further efficiency and economy through coordination and sharing of re - sources. In any event, it is desirable for the judges involved to exchange informa - tion and copies of orders that might affect proceedings in their courts. See gen - erally infra section 31, multiple litigation. In approaching these matters, the court will want to consider the status of the respective actions (some may be close to trial while others are in their early stages), as well as the possibility that some later filed actions may have been filed in other courts by counsel seeking to gain a more prominent and lucrative role. 64 .

This check should take into account not only persons and com - panies formally aligned as adverse parties, but also companies and organizations affiliated with such parties, coparties whose posture might change as the litigation progresses, and persons or companies that might later be added as parties. Firms should also guard against disqualifying conflicts arising during the course of the litigation as a result of acceptance of new clients or taking on of new partners or associates. These checks and safeguards are particularly important for attorneys representing a class or seeking to act as lead counsel in multiparty litigation. 69 Questions about possible disqualification of an attorney should be addressed as soon as they become known and promptly resolved. If a conflict arises or is discovered after representation has been taken on, the attorney may be required to withdraw, unless otherwise ordered by the court. 70 In case of a withdrawal, the attorney must take steps to avoid disrupting the litigation while protecting the former client’s interests; this involves giving reasonable notice, allowing time for employment of a new attorney, and surrendering any papers or property to which the client is entitled. 71 A conflict of interest may be ground for a motion to disqualify counsel. While motions for disqualification should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they are not being used merely to harass, 72 the court should order disqualification when a 68 .

It should be scheduled promptly, generally within 30 to 60 days of filing, but sufficient time should be allowed for counsel to become familiar with the litigation and adequately prepare for the conference. The con - ference should occur before any adversary activity begins, such as filing of mo - tions or discovery requests, and the order setting the conference may order that all such activity be deferred. Although Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) allows 120 days from filing to effect service, earlier service or appearance should be encouraged. 82 Notice of the conference and of any interim administrative measures may then be given even before responsive pleadings are filed. If the primary parties have been given notice, the court need not wait for service to be made on every party. In preparing the order scheduling the conference, 83 reference should be made to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c), which lists subjects for consideration at such a conference. In addition, the court should consider the following matters: • requiring counsel to meet and confer in advance to discuss claims and defenses, a plan for disclosure and discovery, and possible settlement; 84 • identifying specific topics that the court expects to address at the confer - ence; • inviting suggestions from counsel for additional topics to address; 82 . Instead of making formal service, plaintiff may request waiver of service under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d), but this will extend the time for filing a responsive pleading; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3), or, if defendant refuses to waive, postpone the making of effective service; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(2)(F) — note that a refusal to waive service may create a statute of limitations problem since limitations are generally not tolled until formal service is effected. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 advisory committee’s note. The waiver procedure may be most useful where the defendant is located in a foreign country (even though such a defendant may not be assessed costs of service if it fails to waive service), since oth - erwise such service must be made in accordance with the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents, Feb. 10, 1969, 20 U.S.T. 361, T.I.A.S. 6638, 658 U.N.T.S. 163, reprinted following Rule 4, if it applies.

R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1) requires parties to exchange certain core information within ten days of their initial discovery planning conference 90 without awaiting a discovery request. 91 The purpose of prediscovery disclosure is to avoid the cost of unnecessary formal discovery and to accelerate the exchange of basic informa tion useful to the planning and conduct of discovery and to settlement negotia tions. The rule should be administered to serve those purposes; disclosure should not place unreasonable or unnecessary burdens on the parties (it does not require disclosure of any information that would not have to be disclosed in response to discovery requests). In complex litigation, the application of this rule may there - fore have to be modified or suspended entirely. The scope of disputed issues and relevant facts may not be sufficiently clear from the pleadings to enable parties without further clarification to make the requisite disclosure. One purpose of the meeting of counsel required by Rule 26(f) is to identify issues and reach agreement on the content and timing of the initial disclosures. To the extent agreement cannot be reached by the parties at the conference, disclosure should be deferred until after the Rule 16 conference, at which the court can fashion an appropriate order defining and narrowing the fac - tual and legal issues in dispute and, on the basis of that order, establish the scope of disclosure. This will require suspending, by stipulation or order, the rule’s pre - sumptive ten-day deadline for making disclosure. Although the rule defines certain information that must be disclosed, it should not be seen as limiting the scope of prediscovery disclosure and exchange of information. Whether by agreement of counsel or court order, prediscovery 89 .

While the rule does not require actual production (except for damage computations and insurance agreements) but only identification of relevant information and materials, the court may call on the parties to produce and exchange materials in advance of discovery, subject to appropriate objec - tions. Although the court needs to guard against imposing excessive and unneces - sary burdens on the parties, effective use of this device can streamline the litiga - tion. Rule 26(e)(1) requires parties at appropriate intervals to correct or supple - ment disclosures if they learn that the information (even if correct when sup - plied) is materially incomplete or incorrect, unless the corrective or additional information has already been made known to the other parties during discovery or in writing. The parties or the court should set a schedule for such supplemen - tation and may wish to qualify or clarify the scope of the obligation to supple - ment in order to fit the particular litigation. 21.2 Conferences .21 Initial Conference and Orders 41 .211 Case-Management Plan 41 .212 Scheduling Order 43 .213 Class Actions 44 .214 Settlement 45 .22 Subsequent Conferences 45 .23 Attendance 46 Fed.

It provides the first opportunity for the judge to meet counsel, hear their views of the factual and legal issues in the litigation, and begin to structure the litigation and establish a management plan for later proceedings. It is therefore crucial that the judge, as well as the attorneys, be prepared to address the range of topics that the confer - ence should cover. The principal topics (discussed in detail in the following sec - tion) include: • the nature and potential dimensions of the litigation; • the major procedural and substantive problems likely to be encountered; and • the procedures for efficient management. The judge should make clear that the conference is not a perfunctory exercise. The tone needs to be set to make it productive, with counsel being adequately prepared, avoiding contentiousness, and acting with professional courtesy. The judge, for his or her part, needs to promptly make the necessary rulings. The success of the conference depends on the establishment and subsequent mainte - nance of effective communication and coordination between counsel and among counsel and the court (see supra section 20.22). 21.211 Case-Management Plan The primary objective of the conference is to develop (subject to later revision and refinement) a plan for the “just, speedy, and inexpensive determination” of the litigation. This plan should include procedures for identifying and resolving disputed issues of law, identifying and narrowing disputed issues of fact, carrying out disclosure and conducting discovery in an efficient and economical manner, and preparing for trial if the case is not resolved by settlement or summary dis - position. The agenda for the conference needs to be tailored to the needs of the particular litigation. Following is a checklist of topics relevant to the development of case-management plans (see also infra section 33.22 and checklist at infra sec - tion 40.1): • identification and narrowing of issues of fact and law (see infra section 21.33); • deadlines and limits on joinder of parties and amended or additional pleadings (see infra section 21.32);"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • coordination with related litigation (both in federal and state courts), in - cluding later filings, removals, or transfers (see infra section 31); • early resolution of jurisdictional issues; • severance of issues for trial (see infra section 21.632); • consolidation of trials (see infra section 21.631); • the possibility of referring some matters to magistrate judges, special masters, or other judges (see supra sections 20.122, 20.14, and infra sec - tion 21.5); • appointment of liaison/lead/trial counsel and special committees, and maintenance of time and expense records by counsel (see supra sections 20.22, 24.211); • reduction in filing and service requirements through use of a master file and orders under Fed.

They help ensure that counsel will complete the work called for by the management plan in timely fashion and prevent the litigation from languishing on the court’s docket. Rule 16(b) requires that a scheduling order issue early in every case, setting deadlines for joinder of parties, amendment of pleadings, filing of motions, and completion of discovery. Scheduling orders in complex litigation should also cover other im - portant steps in the process of the litigation, in particular discovery activities and motion practice; scheduling orders should be informed by the parties’ discovery plan submitted pursuant to Rule 26(f) (see infra section 21.421). 94 An order may also: • modify the time set by Rule 26(a)(1) for initial disclosure and set dates for its supplementation under Rule 26(e)(1) (see supra section 21.13); 95 93 .

It should, how - ever, be held soon after the initial conference, both to maintain momentum and to comply with the rule requiring the scheduling order to issue “as soon as practi - cable” and within 90 days of a defendant’s appearance and 120 days of service. In any event, the scheduling order should be based on information and recommen - dations from the parties, rather than on a standard form. Developments in the litigation may call for subsequent modification of a scheduling order entered early in the litigation. 21.213 Class Actions When actions include claims by or against a class, the court should consider the appropriate procedure for dealing with the certification issues. In most cases, a schedule should be set at the initial conference for an early ruling on class certification. Class certification or the denial thereof will usually have a substan - tial impact on further proceedings in the litigation, including the scope of discov - ery, the definition of issues, the length and complexity of trial, and the opportu - nities for settlement. Indeed, denial of class certification may put a practical end to the litigation. The court should ascertain what discovery on class questions is needed before a ruling on certification and how such discovery can be conducted efficiently and economically. Other discovery may be stayed if the court believes that resolution of the certification issue may obviate some or all further proceed - ings, but if bifurcating class discovery from merits discovery would result in significant duplication of effort and expense to the parties, discovery may proceed concurrently. For a detailed discussion of the principles and procedures involved in the management of class actions, see infra section 30—for discovery in class actions, see infra section 30.12. 96 . The rule requires parties to amend most discovery responses “seasonably” if they learn that the response is materially “incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.” To maintain order and clarify counsel’s responsibilities, the scheduling order may specify a series of dates on which the parties must provide any amendment required. 97 .

P. 16(b)(6)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 45 21.214 Settlement At each conference, the judge should explore the settlement posture of the parties and the techniques, methods, and mechanisms that may lead to a resolution of the litigation short of trial. While settlement is most advantageous early in the litigation (before much time and money have been expended), meaningful nego - tiations may not be possible until specific critical discovery has been conducted and the parties have acquired a fuller understanding of the strengths and weak - nesses of their respective cases. Discovery may be targeted for this purpose, but settlement discussions should not be permitted to delay or sidetrack the pretrial process. See the discussion at infra section 23.11. Counsel should advise the court promptly when an agreement has been reached or is imminent. 21.22 Subsequent Conferences Conferences following the initial conference are a useful device to monitor the progress of the case and to address problems as they arise in the litigation. Conferences should be scheduled well in advance to ensure maximum atten - dance. While some judges schedule conferences only as the need arises, others have found it effective to schedule conferences at regular and frequent intervals, with agendas composed of items suggested by the parties or designated by the court. Perfunctory appearances by counsel should be avoided, however. Parties may be directed to confer and submit written reports in advance of each confer - ence so that it may be canceled if it appears unnecessary. Conferences may also be held in conjunction with motion hearings. No con - ference should be adjourned without setting the date for the next conference or report from counsel; maintaining firm return dates will ensure that the litigation moves ahead. Between conferences, the court may remain advised of the progress of the case through written status reports or by conference telephone calls. When the court has scheduled a conference, it should distribute to counsel an agenda of items to be addressed, perhaps after calling for suggestions from counsel. Although “off-the-record” discussions may promote greater candor, on-the - record conferences will avoid later disagreements—particularly important if the judge anticipates issuing oral directions or rulings. Many judges find it preferable to hold all conferences on the record 98 and, particularly where there are numer - ous attorneys, in the courtroom. Nevertheless, depending on the specific circum - stances and the personalities of the judge and the attorneys, an informal confer - ence held off the record in chambers or by telephone can be more productive; a reporter can later be brought in to record the results of the conference. As stated above, Rule 16 requires (and sound practice dictates) that all matters decided at 98 . For the requirements for recording various proceedings, see 28 U.S.C. § 753(b)."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third pretrial conferences be memorialized on the record or in a written order. Counsel may be directed to submit proposed orders incorporating the court’s oral rulings. When discovery and other pretrial matters have been substantially com - pleted, the court should hold a final pretrial conference. 99 This conference should be held once a firm trial date has been set, usually about thirty to sixty days before that date. More than one such conference may be needed, particularly if more than one trial is to be held. See infra section 21.6. 21.23 Attendance All attorneys and unrepresented parties should attend the initial pretrial confer - ence. Requirements for attendance at subsequent conferences should be deter - mined based on the purposes of each conference. Costs can be reduced by reliev - ing counsel from the obligation to attend when their clients have no substantial interest in the matters to be discussed or when their interests will be fully repre - sented by designated counsel. While the court should not bar any attorney’s at - tendance, it can advise that attorneys who appear unnecessarily will not be enti - tled to claim court-awarded fees for that time. Similarly, the court may minimize attorneys’ fees by authorizing compensation only for more junior attorneys at routine conferences. On the other hand, as Rule 16(c) requires, each party partic - ipating in a conference should be represented by an attorney with authority to en - ter into stipulations and make admissions as to all matters the participants may reasonably anticipate will be discussed at that conference. Lead trial counsel should always attend the final pretrial conference. Rule 16(f) allows the court to impose sanctions for unexcused nonattendance at any conference. See infra sec - tion 41.2 ¶ 2. Rule 16 also authorizes the court to require persons with authority to settle to attend or make themselves available by telephone. This includes insurance carri - ers or their representatives when their interests are implicated and their presence will facilitate settlement. On the other hand, the presence of parties, while it may facilitate settlement or stipulations, can inhibit counsel and reduce cooperation. If parties do attend, they can periodically be excused from discussions with counsel, but this in turn may undermine the parties’ confidence in their attorneys and in the fairness of the proceedings. The court may also invite a magistrate judge or special master to whom mat - ters to be discussed at the conference have been or may be referred, as well as counsel involved in related litigation. 99 .

Unless the controverted issues have been identified and defined, the materiality of facts and the scope of discov - ery (and later of the trial) cannot be determined. The pleadings, however, will of - ten fail to define the issues with clarity, and the parties may lack sufficient infor - mation at the outset of the case to enable them to arrive at definitions with cer - tainty. Probably the most important function the judge performs in the early stages of litigation management is to press the parties toward identification, definition, and narrowing of issues. The initial conference should be used to start this process. Efforts to clarify and narrow the issues may be met by resistance from the plaintiffs, the defendants, or both—plaintiffs asserting that substantial discovery must first be conducted, and defendants contending that plaintiffs must first refine their claims. Nonetheless, the judge must start the process of defining and structuring the issues, albeit tentatively, to establish the appropriate sequence and limits for discovery. Although some issues may surface only after discovery is underway, the con - trolling factual and legal issues can almost always be identified by a thorough and candid discussion with counsel at the initial conference. The court should use the pleadings and the positions of the parties developed at the initial conference as a starting point for identifying the issues on the basis of which to construct the dis - covery plan. Discovery may then provide information for the further defining and narrowing of issues, which may in turn lead to revision and refinement of the ini - tial discovery plan. 21.32 Pleading and Motion Practice The process of defining and narrowing issues will be advanced if pleadings are finalized and emerging legal issues are promptly resolved by appropriate motions. The court should first establish a schedule for the filing of all pleadings in the case, including counterclaims, cross claims, third-party complaints, and amend - ments to existing pleadings adding parties, claims, or defenses, to avoid later en - largement of issues and expansion or duplication of discovery. The court may also suspend filing of certain pleadings if statutes of limitations present no prob -"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third lems and make orders providing that specified pleadings, motions, and orders, unless specifically disavowed by a party, are “deemed” filed in cases later brought, transferred, or removed, without actually filing the document (see Sample Order infra section 41.52). The pleadings may disclose issues of law that can be resolved by motion to dismiss, to strike, or for judgment on the pleadings. Challenges to the court’s per - sonal or subject matter jurisdiction should generally be given priority, since they are dispositive. The legal insufficiency of a claim or defense may be raised by mo - tion for failure to state a claim or for partial judgment on the pleadings. If the court considers evidence in connection with such a motion, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment. 100 Insufficient defenses and irrelevant or duplicative matter may be stricken under Rule 12(f). If a motion concerns a piv - otal issue which may materially advance the termination of the litigation, the court may certify its ruling for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) if, in the court’s judgment, there is “substantial ground for difference of opinion.” The court may also provide for appellate review by entering final judgment as to a particular claim or party under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). See infra section 25.1. Motion practice can be a source of substantial cost and delay unless appro - priately managed. Following are some points to consider: • Because a motion under Rule 12 can result in unnecessary expense if the asserted defect can be cured by amendment, it is generally advisable for a party to notify the opposing party and the court of its intention to file such a motion to ascertain whether it will serve to narrow the issues in the case. • Some courts have found prefiling conferences useful in avoiding useless or unnecessary motions. • Some motions can be decided on the basis of oral presentations and ref - erence to controlling authority, without the filing of briefs. • The court may limit the length of briefs and of appendices, affidavits, declarations, and other supporting materials, and require joint briefs whenever feasible. • The court may limit the filing of reply or supplemental briefs, or motions for reconsideration, requiring leave of court for good cause shown. • Prompt rulings by the court will expedite the litigation and result in sav - ings by avoiding unnecessary litigation activity by the parties; whenever possible, judges should rule from the bench, avoiding the delay caused by the preparation of a written disposition. 100 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), (c). For discussion of summary judgment, see infra § 21.34."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 49 • Some courts issue tentative rulings on motions in advance of the motion hearing. If the parties accept the rulings, no hearing is necessary. If there is a hearing, the parties can direct their arguments to the issues that con - cern the court. • In multiparty litigation, particular attention needs to be given to scheduling. Counsel should be directed to inform the court as soon as possible of any motion to be filed, with sufficient time allowed for oppos - ing counsel to respond and the court to review the parties’ submissions in advance. Expedited motions should be avoided unless they concern mat - ters that will delay further proceedings if not resolved. Motion hearings should be specially set rather than be part of a regular motion docket or calendar call of the court, but they may be combined with other confer - ences in the litigation. 21.33 Identifying, Narrowing, and Resolving Issues As noted, the process of identifying, defining, and narrowing issues begins at the initial conference. The attorneys may be directed to confer and submit a tentative statement of disputed issues in advance, agreed on to the extent possible (see supra section 21.11). The court should treat the conference as an opportunity to learn about the material facts and legal issues, and counsel should treat it as an opportunity to educate the judge. At the same time, counsel will learn about the opponent’s case and gain a better perspective on their own, helping them to eval - uate their case more realistically. For the process to be productive, the judge must be willing to admit ignorance and ask even basic questions. The court’s questions should probe into the parties’ claims and defenses and seek specific information. The judge, instead of being satisfied, for example, with a statement that defendant “was negligent” or “breached the contract,” should insist that the attorneys de - scribe the material facts they intend to prove and the manner in which they in - tend to prove them. The judge should inquire not only into the amount of damages claimed but also into the proposed proof and manner of computation, including the evidence of causation, and the specific nature of any other relief sought (data which may also be subject to mandatory prediscovery disclosure, see supra section 21.13). Similar inquiry should be made of the defense: what specific allegations and claims it disputes, the specific defenses it intends to raise, and the proof it intends to offer. This process should lead to identification of the genuine disputes and may facilitate admissions and stipulations between the parties, eliminating the need to litigate undisputed issues and narrowing the scope of the remaining is - sues. The parties may be able to stipulate to the authenticity of documents or the accuracy of underlying statistical or technical data while reserving the right to dispute assumptions, interpretations, or inferences drawn from the evidence."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third Facts may be shown to be subject to judicial notice, after the opposing party has had an opportunity to proffer contradictory evidence. 101 A variety of techniques have been used to facilitate the identification, defining, and narrowing of issues in complex litigation, including the following: • nonbinding statements of counsel, such as those that may be required at the initial conference (see supra section 21.11)—these may be updated periodically by written reports or oral statements at later conferences; • voluntary abandonment of tenuous claims or defenses by the parties, of - ten after probing by the court into the likelihood of success and the po - tential disadvantages of pursuing them; • requiring counsel to list the essential elements of the cause of action— this exercise, designed to clarify the claims, may assist in identifying ele - ments in dispute and can result in abandonment of essentially duplicative theories of recovery; • formal amendments to the pleadings, including those resulting from an order under Fed.

As the Supreme Court has stated, summary judgment is “not . . . a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather . . . an integral part of the Federal Rules.” 103 If granted, summary judgment may eliminate the need for further proceedings or at least re - duce the scope of discovery or trial. Even if denied, in whole or in part, the par - ties’ formulations of their positions may help clarify and define issues and the scope of further discovery. In addition, the court may, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d), issue an order specifying those facts which “appear without substantial controversy” and shall be “deemed established” for trial purposes. Summary judgment proceedings can, however, be costly and time consum - ing. To avoid the filing of unproductive motions, the court may require a prefiling conference at which it can ascertain whether issues are appropriate for summary judgment, whether there are disputed issues of fact, and whether the motion, even if granted, is likely to expedite the termination of the litigation. In some circumstances, a separate trial of an issue bifurcated under Rule 42(b) may be a preferable alternative. Although summary judgment is as appropriate in complex litigation as in routine cases 104 —indeed it offers the potential of substantial savings of money and time—and, as a general proposition, the standard for deciding a summary judgment motion is the same in all cases, 105 the court needs to be concerned with 103 .

Complex litigation may present complicated issues not as readily susceptible to resolution as issues in more familiar settings. More extensive discovery may be necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision. 106 The party opposing summary judgment should, however, be required to make the necessary showing under Rule 56(f) in support of its request for additional discovery. 107 To avoid expenditure of effort on pretrial activities that may be rendered un - necessary if the motion is granted, the schedule should call for filing of the mo - tion as early as possible to maximize the potential benefits that may be realized from its disposition while affording the parties an adequate opportunity to con - duct discovery relevant to the issues raised by the motion, obtain needed evi - dence, and develop a sufficient record for decision. 108 Allowing adequate time for preparation before the motion is filed should reduce the need for granting the opposing party a continuance under Rule 56(f) to obtain affidavits or conduct further discovery to oppose the motion. In support of its request for a continu - ance, the party must specify (1) the discovery it proposes to take, (2) the evidence likely to be uncovered, and (3) the material fact issues that evidence will support. Under Rule 56(c), the court is to rule on the motion on the basis of “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, to - gether with the affidavits.” 109 The affidavits “shall be made on personal knowl - edge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.” 110 Because of the volume of discovery materials in complex litigation, and the potential for disputes over admissibility, these provisions can be a par - Eastman Kodak v.

Early and ongoing judicial control is therefore imperative for effective management. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with the court’s inherent power to manage the litigation before it, provide ample authority. 113 For a checklist for discovery and prediscovery disclosure, see infra section 40.2. 21.41 Relationship to Issues 114 Fundamental to control is that discovery be directed at the material issues in controversy. The general principle governing the scope of discovery stated in Rule 26(b)(1) permits discovery of matters “relevant to the subject matter . . . [of] the action” if “[t]he information sought . . . appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” But Rule 26(b)(2) directs the court to limit the frequency and extent of use of the discovery methods permitted by the rules, to prevent “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative” discovery and discovery for which “the burden or expense . . . outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account 113 . See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 350–54 (1978); Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 (1979). 114 .

Early identification and clarification of issues (see supra section 21.3) is therefore essential to meaningful and fair discovery control. It enables the court to assess the materiality and relevance of proposed discovery and provides the basis for formulating a fair and effective discovery plan. A plan established early in the litigation needs to take into account the possibility of revisions based on information gained through discovery, while seeking to avoid duplicative discov - ery. The costs and benefits of alternative approaches to the sequencing of discov - ery should be considered. For example, deferring discovery on damages until li - ability has been decided may result in savings, but may also lead to duplication should discovery have to be resumed. Conversely, conducting discovery on dam - ages before discovery on liability will sometimes facilitate early settlement by in - forming the parties of their potential exposure, but may prove to have been un - necessary if the defendant is found not liable. 21.42 Planning and Control .421 Discovery Plan/Scheduling Conference 56 .422 Limitations 57 .423 Other Practices to Save Time and Expense 60 .424 Resolution of Discovery Disputes 62 A discovery plan should be designed to facilitate the orderly and cost-effective ac - quisition of relevant information and materials and the prompt resolution of dis - covery disputes. No single format is appropriate for all cases; the discovery plan should be tailored to the circumstances of the litigation. While the court needs to take responsibility for the adoption of a discovery plan, its development and im - plementation must necessarily be a collaborative effort with counsel. Because the lawyers will be more familiar with the case, the court should call on them initially to propose a plan. Agreement among counsel is, of course, desirable, and joint recommendations should be given considerable weight. Nevertheless the judge should not accept them uncritically and may need to place limits on discovery even if agreed on by counsel. The judge’s role is to oversee the plan and provide guidance and control, always recognizing that the litigation is conducted by the lawyers and not the court. In performing that role, the judge, while recognizing his or her limited familiarity with the case, should not as a result abdicate the re - sponsibility for control. Judges should not hesitate to ask counsel why particular discovery is needed and whether needed information can be obtained more efficiently and economically by other means. Regular contact with counsel"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third through periodic conferences will enable the court to monitor the progress of the plan, ensure that it is operating fairly and effectively, and from time to time adjust it as needed. 21.421 Discovery Plan/Scheduling Conference Adoption of a discovery plan is one of the principal purposes of the initial confer - ence. 115 That conference should be preceded by a meeting of counsel for the purpose of developing a discovery plan for submission to the court. 116 Rule 26(f) requires such a meeting, 117 and Rule 26(d) bars discovery, absent stipula tion or court order, 118 before that meeting. 119 Within ten days after the meeting the parties must submit to the court a written report outlining the plan. 120 The plan is to address: • the form and timing of disclosure; • the subjects of and completion date for discovery; and • the possibility of phasing, limiting, or focusing discovery in light of the is - sues. The parties’ submission will be the starting point for the development of the plan. The court should hold the parties to their responsibility under Rule 26(f) and, if necessary, direct them to resume discussion to prepare a useful proposed plan. 121 Orderly management of the litigation will ordinarily be served by de ferring commencement of discovery until after adoption of a plan. Subjects for consideration at the conference bearing on the discovery plan may include the following: 115 . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(6). See also supra §§ 21.11, 21.33. 116 . For a discussion of the factors to be considered in formulating a discovery plan, see William W Schwarzer et al., Civil Discovery and Mandatory Disclosure (1994). 117 . The rule places joint responsibility on the attorneys of record and all unrepresented parties to arrange, attend (or be represented at), and participate in good faith in the conference. 118 . The one exception is found in Rule 30(a)(2)(C), which allows a deposition to be taken before the discovery conference if the notice contains a certification, with supporting facts, that the deponent is expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for examination in this country unless deposed before that time. Such a deposition may not be used against a party who demon - strates that it was unable through diligence to obtain counsel to represent it at the deposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3). 119 . Some courts have local rules that allow preconference discovery; Rule 26(d) expressly provides that such rules supersede its general prohibition on such discovery. It may be appropriate for the court to enter a specific order on the matter in the particular litigation. 120 . For a sample report, see form 35 of the Fed. R. Civ. P. Appendix of Forms . 121 .

Rule 26(e)(2) does not apply to deposition testimony, but when the deposition of an expert from whom a report was required under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) reveals changes in the expert’s opinion, it triggers the duty of supplementation imposed by Rule 26(e)(1). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 ad visory committee’s note; Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(C)."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third for discovery, and Rule 26(b) directs the court to limit the “frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods” under the rules, including the length of deposi - tions. Rule 30(a) imposes a presumptive limit of ten depositions per side, and Rule 33 establishes a presumptive limit of twenty-five interrogatories per party (see infra sections 21.451, 21.462). Rule 26(f)(3) requires the parties to address discovery limits in their proposed discovery plan. Limits (which may be made merely presumptive) should be set early in the litigation, before discovery has begun. Because information about the litigation will be limited at that time, limits may need to be revised in the light of later de - velopments. But they should be imposed on the basis of the best information available at the time, after full consultation with counsel, and on the understand - ing that they will remain binding until further order. In determining appropriate limits, the court will need to confront difficult questions of balancing efficiency and economy against the parties’ need to develop an adequate record for sum - mary judgment or trial. The difficulty of this task should not deter the judge from undertaking it, but it underlines the importance of clarifying and understanding the issues in the case before imposing limits. 123 • Time limits and schedules. The discovery plan should include a schedule for the completion of specified discovery, affording a basis for judicial monitoring of progress. Setting a discovery cutoff date 124 at the initial conference, however, may not be feasible in complex litigation, though the setting of such a date at the appropriate time should remain an ob - jective. When a discovery cutoff date is set, it should not be set so far in advance of the anticipated trial date that the product of discovery be - comes stale and the parties’ preparation outdated. Time limits impose a valuable discipline on attorneys, forcing them to be selective and helping to move the case expeditiously, but standing alone may be insufficient to control discovery costs. Unless complemented by other limitations, at - torneys may simply conduct multitrack discovery, increasing expense and prejudicing parties with limited resources. To prevent time limits from being frustrated, the court should rule promptly on disputes so that fur - ther discovery is not delayed or hampered while a ruling is pending. • Limits on quantity. Time limits may be complemented by limits on the number and length of depositions, on the number of interrogatories, and on the volume of requests for production. Such limitations should be imposed only after the court has heard from the attorneys and is able to make a reasonably informed judgment about the needs of the case. They are best applied sequentially to particular phases of the litigation, rather 123 . See Schwarzer and Hirsch, supra note 106. 124 . See In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 685 F.2d 810 (3d Cir. 1982)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 59 than as aggregate limitations. When limits are placed on discovery of vo - luminous transactions or other events, statistical sampling techniques may be used to measure whether the results of the discovery fairly repre - sent what unrestricted discovery would have been expected to produce (for a general discussion of statistical sampling, see infra section 21.493). • Phased, sequenced, or targeted discovery. It will rarely be possible for counsel and the court to determine conclusively early in the litigation what discovery will be necessary; some discovery of potential relevance at the outset may be rendered irrelevant as the litigation proceeds and the need for other discovery may become known only through later devel - opments. For effective discovery control, therefore, the court should di - rect initial discovery at matters—witnesses, documents, information — that appear pivotal. As the litigation proceeds, this initial discovery may render other discovery unnecessary or provide leads for further necessary discovery. Initial discovery may also be targeted at information that may facilitate settlement negotiations or provide the foundation for a disposi - tive motion; a discovery plan may call for limited discovery to lay the foundation for early settlement discussions. Targeted discovery may be nonexhaustive, conducted to rapidly produce critical information on one or more specific issues. In permitting this kind of discovery, the court must balance the potential savings against the risk of later duplicative dis - covery should the deposition of a witness or the production of docu - ments have to be resumed. Targeted discovery may in some cases be ap - propriate in connection with a motion for class certification; matters rel - evant to such a motion may, however, be so intertwined with the merits that targeting discovery would be inefficient. See supra section 21.41 and infra section 30.12. • Subject matter priorities. Where the scope of the litigation—as, for ex - ample, in the case of antitrust litigation—is in doubt at the outset, dis - covery may be limited to particular time periods or geographical areas, until the relevance of expanded discovery has been established. See supra section 21.41. • Sequencing by parties. Although discovery by all parties ordinarily pro - ceeds concurrently, sometimes one or more parties should be allowed to proceed first. For example, if a party needs discovery to respond to an early summary judgment motion, that party may be given priority. The court may establish periods in which particular parties will be given ex - clusive or preferential rights to take depositions, and in multiple litigation the court may direct that discovery be conducted in some cases before others. Sometimes “common” discovery is ordered to proceed in a"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third specified sequence, without similarly limiting “individual” discovery in the various cases. • Forms of discovery. The court may prescribe a sequence for particular types of discovery—for example, interrogatories may be used to identify needed discovery and documents, followed by requests for production of documents, depositions, and finally requests for admission. If the court directs that discovery be conducted in a specified sequence, leave should be granted to vary the order for good cause, as when emergency deposi - tions are needed for witnesses in ill health or about to leave the country. 21.423 Other Practices to Save Time and Expense Various other practices can help minimize the cost, delay, and burden associated with discovery. They include the following: • Stipulations under Fed. R. Civ. P. 29. The rule gives parties authority to alter procedures, limitations, and time limits on discovery so long as they do not interfere with times set by court order. Thus the parties can facili - tate discovery by stipulating with respect to notice and manner of taking depositions and adopting various informal procedures. The court may, however, require that it be kept advised to ensure compliance with the discovery plan and may by order preclude stipulations on particular mat - ters. • Informal discovery. Counsel should be encouraged to exchange infor - mation, particularly relevant documents, without resort to formal discov - ery (see supra section 21.13). Early exchanges can make later depositions more efficient. Informal interviews with potential witnesses can help de - termine whether a deposition is needed, inform later discovery, and pro - vide the basis for requests for admission through which the results of in - formal discovery are made admissible at trial. • Automatic disclosure. Rule 26(a)(1) and many local rules and standing orders require the parties to identify relevant witnesses and categories of documents early in the litigation, without waiting for discovery requests. By stipulation or court order, the timing and content of this disclosure may be tailored to the needs of the particular case. See supra section 21.13. • Reducing deposition costs. Savings may be realized if depositions are taken, when feasible, by telephone, by electronic recording devices, or by having deponents come to central locations. Likewise, parties may forego attending a deposition in which they have only a minor interest if a pro - cedure is established for supplemental questions—as by telephone, writ - ten questions, or resumption of examination in person—in the event"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 61 that, after a review of the transcript, they find further inquiry necessary. See infra section 21.45 for additional discussion of deposition practices. • Information from other litigation and sources. When information is available from public records (such as government studies or reports), from other litigation, 125 or from discovery conducted by others in the same litigation, the parties may be required to review those materials be - fore additional discovery is undertaken. If those materials will be usable as evidence in the present litigation, 126 the parties may be limited to supplemental discovery. Cost savings may also be realized through coor - dination of “common” discovery in related litigation, even if pending in other courts. If related cases are pending in more than one court, com - mon discovery should be coordinated to avoid duplication and conflicts, as by formulating a joint discovery plan for all cases, agreeing that one of the cases will be treated as the lead case (with its discovery plan serving as the starting point for development of supplemental plans in the other courts), or using joint deposition notices. See infra section 31. Counsel may also agree that discovery taken in one proceeding can be used in re - lated proceedings as though taken there. • Joint discovery requests and responses. In multiparty cases in which no lead counsel has been designated, parties with similar positions may be required to submit a combined set of interrogatories, requests for pro - duction, or requests for admission. If voluminous materials are to be produced in response, the responding party may be relieved of the re - quirement of furnishing copies to each discovering party. For further dis - cussion of document discovery, including use of document depositories, see infra section 21.44. • Modified discovery responses. When a response to a discovery request can be provided in a form somewhat different from that requested, but with substantially the same information and at a saving in time and ex - pense, the responding party should make that fact known and seek agreement from the requesting party. For example, information sought on a calendar year basis may be readily and inexpensively available on a fiscal year basis. Similarly, if some requested information can be pro - 125 . Access to materials and testimony given in other cases may be impeded because of confidentiality orders, restrictions on release of grand jury materials, and other limitations. See supra § 21.43 and infra § 31. 126 . Interrogatory answers, depositions, and testimony given in another action ordinarily are admissible if made by and offered against a party in the current action. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Similarly, they may be admissible for certain purposes if made by a witness in the current action. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1). The parties may stipulate to the admissibility of other information."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third duced promptly but additional time will be needed for other items, the responding party should produce the information presently available and indicate when the remainder will be produced. Preferably, formal discov - ery requests should be prepared only after counsel have informally dis - cussed what information is needed and how it can be produced most efficiently. • Combined discovery requests. Several forms of discovery may be com - bined into a single request. For example, a party may be asked to admit a particular fact under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36; if not so admitted, the party is asked to respond under Rule 33 by stating its position as to that fact and indicating whether it has any evidence to support it. If so, the party is asked to identify and produce under Rule 34 any such documentary evi - dence and to identify the persons having knowledge of the matter for possible deposition under Rule 30 or 31. This technique eliminates the need for documentary or deposition evidence on matters that the oppos - ing party admits or is unable to refute. Ordinarily, more time should be allowed for responding to a combined discovery request; even so, less time may be consumed overall than if traditional separate discovery re - quests were made. Because the rules impose no limits on requests for admission as they do on interrogatories, an order enlarging the number of permissible interrogatories may be necessary. • Conference depositions. If knowledge of a subject is divided among sev - eral people and credibility is not an issue, a “conference deposition” may be feasible. Each witness is sworn, and the questions are then directed to the group or those having the information sought. Persons in other loca - tions who may also be needed to provide information may be scheduled to be “on call” during the conference deposition. This procedure may be useful in obtaining background information, identifying and explaining documents, and examining reports compiled by several persons. • Subpoenas. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45, an attorney may subpoena docu - ments or other tangibles from nonparties, avoiding unnecessary deposi - tions. The rule also provides for subpoenas to permit inspection of premises in the possession of nonparties, rendering unnecessary the commencement of an independent proceeding. See infra section 21.447. 21.424 Resolution of Discovery Disputes Discovery disputes, with their potential of breeding satellite litigation, are a major source of cost and delay. Few aspects of litigation management are more impor - tant than bringing about the prompt and inexpensive resolution of such disputes. The mere availability of such a procedure—and the court’s insistence that it be adhered to—will deter counsel from the kind of conduct that often obstructs dis -"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 63 covery, since no advantage can be gained from it. Many district judges have found that use of procedures such as those described here take little of their time but re - sult in substantial improvement in the conduct of discovery. Such procedures are equally effective where discovery management is referred to a magistrate judge. A discovery plan should therefore include specific provisions, such as the following, for the fair and efficient resolution of discovery disputes. Presubmission conference of counsel. No dispute or request for relief should be submitted to the court until after the parties have met and attempted to re solve it. Rules 37(a) and 26(c) condition the right to make a motion to compel or for a protective order upon certification that the movant has in good faith con ferred or attempted to confer with the opponent to resolve the matter without court action. Most local rules require such a conference before any discovery dis pute is brought to the court (some judges require the participation of local counsel in this conference). 127 It is advisable, however, for the discovery plan or scheduling order to specify the ground rules for such conferences, such as requir ing that the party requesting the conference send the opponent a clear and con cise statement of the asserted deficiencies or objections and the requested action; having to narrow and define the dispute and the requested relief will cause coun sel to prepare for the conference, consult with clients, and seek a resolution that will avoid the need for judicial intervention. Any resulting resolution should be reduced to writing. Submission to the court. Although opinions differ, many judges believe that by making themselves available to resolve such disputes informally, disputes are in fact discouraged and those that are submitted can be resolved quickly. Many judges direct counsel to present disputes by conference telephone call. Others di - rect submission by letter. In many courts, magistrate judges use such procedures. A brief excerpt of the transcript containing relevant proceedings, either in writing or read by the reporter over the phone, will be helpful to the decision maker. The availability of a speedy resolution process, particularly in the course of a deposi - tion, tends to deter unreasonable and obstructive conduct; when the attorneys know that the judge (or magistrate judge) is readily available by telephone and the opponent can obtain prompt relief, the incentive for unreasonable behavior is reduced. Judges who use such procedures have found that they in fact hear few disputes (see infra section 21.456). Avoiding formal motions in discovery disputes has the additional merit of forcing attorneys to narrow and simplify the dispute rather than to elaborate on it as they would in a brief. Questions from the judge will further narrow and clarify 127 . See, e.g., Standing Orders of the Court on Effective Discovery in Civil Cases (E.D.N.Y. 1984) and Guidelines for Discovery, Motion Practice and Trial (N.D. Cal. 1987), reprinted in Litigation Manual, supra note 5, forms 27 and 16, respectively."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third the dispute. Often, the resolution of the dispute becomes self-evident during the course of the conference. Even if informal presentation does not resolve a dispute, it can help to define and narrow it for further proceedings. If informal procedures fail or are rejected, the court should adopt procedures to minimize the activity needed to resolve the dispute. Motions, memoranda, and supporting materials should be restricted in length, replies normally barred, and time limits for submission set. At times, of course, discovery disputes involving is sues having a significant impact on the litigation, such as rulings on privilege, may require substantial proceedings. Discovery with respect to the dispute itself should be avoided except in extraordinary circumstances. Special masters have been successfully used to oversee discovery, particularly where there are numerous issues, such as claims of privilege to resolve. Because appointments of special masters can increase substantially the cost of litigation (though the resulting efficiencies could result in offsetting savings), they should not be made except in cases where the parties can afford the cost, and preferably not over the parties’ objections. 128 Submission of certain discovery disputes may be made to a judge outside of the district. A motion to compel or to terminate a deposition held outside the dis - trict where the action is pending, or for a protective order, may be presented ei - ther to the judge before whom it is pending or to a judge in the district where the deposition is being held. 129 In complex litigation, particularly if procedures have already been established for expedited consideration, it may be well to re quire all such matters to be presented to the assigned judge. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1) requires that motions to compel be presented to the court where the ac tion is pending if directed at a party; only if directed at a nonparty must it be pre sented to a court in the district where the discovery is taken. When a dispute is presented to a deposition-district court, however, the assigned judge may have or be able to obtain authority to act also as deposition judge in that district, and in deed may be able to exercise those powers by telephone. 130 In multidistrict litigation under 28 U.S.C. § 1407(b), “the judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned, the members of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, and other circuit and district judges designated when needed by the panel may exercise the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions.” In other cases, arrangements may sometimes be made for an inter district or 128 .

Whatever procedure is adopted, the court should expedite the reso - lution of discovery disputes. While such disputes remain pending, they tend to disrupt the discovery program and result in additional cost and delay. It is gen - erally more important to the parties that the dispute be decided promptly than that it be decided perfectly. The resolution should be memorialized on the record or by written order; prevailing counsel may be asked to prepare a proposed order and submit it to the opponent for review and then to the court. If the order is made at a conference during a deposition, the conference and order can be tran - scribed as part of the deposition transcript. 21.43 Privilege Claims and Protective Orders .431 Claims of Privilege/Full Protection 65 .432 Limited Disclosure/Protective Orders 67 .433 Allocation of Costs 72 Attention should be given at an early conference, preferably before discovery be - gins, to the possible need for procedures to accommodate claims of privilege or for protection of materials from discovery as trial preparation materials, 131 as trade secrets, or on privacy grounds. 132 If not addressed early, these matters may later disrupt the discovery schedule. Consideration will need to be given not only to the rights and needs of the parties but also to the existing or potential in terests of those not involved in the litigation. 133 21.431 Claims of Privilege/Full Protection Certain materials may qualify for full protection against disclosure or discovery as privileged, 134 as trial preparation material, 135 or as incriminating under the Fifth 131 . “Trial preparation materials” include, but are not limited to, traditional “work product.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) & advisory committee’s note. 132 . Although there is no privacy privilege, maintenance of privacy can be the ground for a protective order. See Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 30, 35 n.21 (1984). 133 . For a thorough discussion of the issues raised by protective orders, see Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 529 F. Supp. 866 (E.D.

Rulings on claims of privilege in diversity cases are governed by Fed. R. Evid. 501, which provides that privilege is determined by state law where state law supplies the rule of decision. 135 . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), which extends qualified protection to such materials."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"66 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third Amendment. 136 To minimize their potentially disruptive effects on dis covery, the possibility of such claims should be addressed at an early conference and a procedure established for their resolution or for avoidance through appro priate sequencing of discovery. 137 A claim for protection against disclosure on the ground of privilege or protection of trial preparation materials must be made “expressly” and describe the nature of the allegedly protected information sufficiently to enable opposing parties to assess the merits of the claim. 138 This is usually accomplished by submission of a log 139 identifying documents or other communications by date and by the names of the author(s) and recipient(s), and describing their general subject matter (without revealing the privileged or protected material). 140 Unresolved claims of privilege should be pre sented directly to the judge for a ruling; if necessary, the judge can review the in formation in dispute in camera. The party seeking protection may, however, request that the trial judge not see the document, especially in a nonjury case. In such circumstances, the court may, in its discretion, refer the matter to another judge, a magistrate judge, or a special master. Since judges are accustomed to reviewing matters that may not be admissible, counsel should restrict such requests to the most sensitive, potentially prejudicial materials and be prepared to indicate, at least in general terms, the basis for the request. In complex litigation involving voluminous documents, privileged docu - ments are occasionally produced inadvertently. The parties may stipulate, or an order may provide, that such production shall not be considered a waiver of privi lege and that the party receiving such a document shall return it promptly with out making a copy. 136 . Potential Fifth Amendment claims are one reason why discovery in civil litigation may be stayed, in whole or in part, until termination of related criminal proceedings. See infra § 31.2. Conclusion of the criminal case, however, will not necessarily avoid further assertions of the privi - lege against self-incrimination. 137 . The parties may facilitate discovery by agreeing that the disclosure of a privileged doc ument will not be deemed a waiver with respect to that document or other documents involving the same subject matter. Some courts, however, have refused to enforce such agreements. See In re Chrysler Motors Corp. Overnight Evaluation Program Litig., 860 F.2d 844, 846–47 (8th Cir. 1988); Khandji v. Keystone Resorts Management, Inc., 140 F.R.D. 697, 700 (D. Colo. 1992); Chubb Integrated Sys. v. National Bank, 103 F.R.D. 52, 67–68 (D.D.C. 1984). 138 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5), 45(d)(2). Withholding materials otherwise subject to disclosure without such notice may subject a party to Rule 37 sanctions and waive the privilege or protection. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee’s note. 139 . A frequently used term for this log is a “ Vaughn Index.” See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). 140 . Rule 26(b)(5) does not specify the information that must be provided, which may depend on the nature and amount of material withheld. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee’s note."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 67 21.432 Limited Disclosure/Protective Orders Complex litigation will frequently involve information or documents a party may consider sensitive. Two alternative approaches are available for seeking protection for such material: one or more parties may seek “umbrella” protective orders, usually by stipulation, or the claim to protection may be litigated document by document. Umbrella orders. When the volume of potentially protected materials is large, an umbrella order will expedite production, reduce costs, and avoid the burden on the court of document-by-document adjudication. Umbrella orders provide that all assertedly confidential material disclosed (and appropriately identified, usually by stamp) is presumptively protected unless challenged. The orders are made without a particularized showing to support the claim for protection, but such a showing must be made whenever a claim under an order is challenged. Some courts have therefore found that umbrella orders simply postpone, rather than eliminate, the need for the court to closely scrutinize discovery material to determine whether protection is justified, thereby delaying rather than expediting the litigation. 141 Applications for umbrella orders, usually presented to the court by stipula - tion of the parties, should specify the following matters: 142 • the categories of information subject to the order; 143 • the procedure for determining which particular documents are within protected categories; 144 141 . See John Does I–VI v. Yogi, 110 F.R.D. 629, 632 (D.D.C. 1986). The problems of pre serving protection for documents produced under umbrella orders are aggravated by the understandable tendency of counsel to err on the side of caution by designating any possibly sensitive documents as confidential under the order. The time saved by excessive designations, however, may be more than offset by the difficulties of later opposing some request for access or disclosure. Although the judge, in the interest of reducing the time and expense of the discovery process, should be somewhat tolerant of this practice, counsel should not mark documents as protected under the order without a good faith belief that they are entitled to protection. Counsel should also be cautioned against objecting to document requests without first ascertaining that the requested documents exist. The designation of a document as confidential should be viewed as equivalent to a motion for a protective order and subject to the sanctions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4), as provided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). 142 . See Sample Orders infra § 41.36, forms (A) and (B). 143 . Umbrella orders should specify the classes or categories of documents that may be des - ignated as confidential. A standardless stipulation or order violates Rule 26(c) and can be counter - productive by inviting disputes. 144 . Umbrella orders do not eliminate the burden on the person seeking protection of justifying the relief sought as to every item, but simply facilitate rulings on disputed claims of confidentiality.

Items produced under a claim of confidentiality should be identified with some special marking at the time of production to ensure that all persons know exactly what materials have been designated as confidential throughout the litigation. Specific portions of deposition transcripts may be marked as confidential through a written designation procedure; see Sample Order infra § 41.36, ¶ 5. If numerous documents are involved, a log may be maintained describing the documents and identifying the persons having access to them. 146 . For example, counsel are ordinarily permitted to disclose such information to assistants in their offices and potential expert witnesses. On the other hand, disclosure to clients may be pro - hibited where, for example, the information has commercial value and the parties are competitors; alternatively, the order may (1) limit disclosure to named individuals not involved in the relevant corporate activity, (2) create a special class of highly confidential documents that only attorneys and nonclient experts may view, (3) require particularized record keeping of disclosures to client per - sonnel, and (4) require individual undertakings by those receiving such information not to misuse it. An attorney (not a paralegal or employee) should review the list of persons to whom disclosure may be made and all related provisions of the order. 147 . Restrictions on use in other litigation may not provide complete protection. See, e.g. , In re Dual-Deck Video Cassette Recorder Antitrust Litig., 10 F.3d 693 (9th Cir. 1993) (reversing con - tempt order where party used confidential information but did not reveal trade secrets). 148 . For example, information may be sealed or exempted from filing with the court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d) or 26(a)(4). Copying or computerization of particularly sensitive documents may be prohibited or tightly controlled. See Sample Order infra § 41.36, ¶ 9. The order may require that each person shown a document designated as confidential also be shown the order and advised of the obligation to honor the confidentiality designation. To ensure binding effect, all persons to whom disclosure is made should be required to sign a copy of the order. 149 . A common procedure is for the producing party to mark all assertedly protected mate rial “confidential”; the opposing party then has a specified period, usually about two weeks, within which to contest the designation. See Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 529 (1st Cir. 1993). The burden remains on the party seeking protection; the opposing party need not offer affidavits to support a challenge. See id . at 531. 150 . For example, the order may allow otherwise protected information to be shown to a witness at or in preparation for a deposition.

Particularized protective orders. A person from whom discovery is sought may move under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a protective order limiting disclosure or providing for the confidentiality of information produced. As with other discov - ery motions, the movant must first make a good faith attempt to resolve the dis - pute without court action; 151 the parties should address the subject of protective orders in their proposed discovery plan. 152 Rule 26(c) allows the court to “make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” A protective order should be entered only when the movant makes a particularized showing of “good cause,” by affidavit or testimony of a witness with personal knowledge, of the specific harm that would result from disclosure or loss of confidentiality; gen - eralities and unsupported contentions do not suffice. 153 When directed solely at discovery materials, protective orders are not subject to the high level of scrutiny required by the Constitution to justify prior restraints; rather, courts have broad discretion at the discovery stage to decide when a protective order is appropriate and what degree of protection is required. 154 In fashioning the order, the court should balance the movants’ legitimate concerns about confidentiality against the needs of the litigation, protecting indi - vidual privacy, or the commercial value of information while making it available for legitimate litigation use. 155 The objective should be to protect only material for which a clear and significant need for confidentiality has been shown; 156 this will reduce the burdensomeness of the order and render it less vulnerable to later challenge.

In addition, the court should define the terms of the release, including precisely who may have access to the information and for what purpose. A common basis for nonparty requests for release is the need for the infor - mation in related litigation. 161 Even where the protective order contains a pro - vision prohibiting such use, the court that entered the order may require such disclosure, subject to appropriate restrictions on further use and disclosure. 162 In making this determination, the court must balance the continuing need for protection against the efficiency and judicial economy that may result from re - lease. Questions to consider include the following: 158 . See Public Citizen , 858 F.2d at 781–82. Some states have passed legislation limiting courts’ ability to prevent public access to litigation materials that relate to public safety; there have been proposals for similar reform in many states and in Congress. See Miller, supra note 155, at 441–45. 159 . The court may also want to consider the disclosing party’s degree of reliance on the pro - tective order when disclosure was made. If a party freely disclosed information without contest based on the premise that it would remain confidential, subsequent dissemination may be unfair and may, in the long run, reduce other litigants’ confidence in protective orders, rendering them less useful as a tool for preventing discovery abuse and encouraging more strenuous objections to discovery requests. See Miller, supra note 155, at 499–500; cf. Meyer Goldberg, Inc. v. Fisher Foods, Inc., 823 F.2d 159, 163 (6th Cir. 1987); Palmieri v. New York, 779 F.2d 861, 863 (2d Cir. 1985). 160 . See United Nuclear Corp. v. Cranford Ins. Co., 905 F.2d 1424, 1428 (10th Cir. 1990) (citing cases). If the party seeking information would be entitled to obtain it in the other litigation, there is little need to require redundant discovery proceedings. See id. at 1428 ( citing Wilk v. American Medical Ass’n, 635 F.2d 1295, 1299 (7th Cir. 1980)). 161 . Conversely, the parties before the court may seek discovery of information subject to a protective order in other litigation. Generally, the party seeking discovery should first establish its right to it in the court in which the discovery will be used. If that court permits discovery, the effect given the earlier protective order should normally be determined by the court that issued it. For discussion of the use of documents from other litigation, see supra § 21.423. 162 .

While it is common for protective orders to include provisions for posttrial protection, an order is still subject to modification after judgment or settlement, even if the order was entered on consent of the parties. 169 21.433 Allocation of Costs The cost of seeking and responding to discovery is a part of the cost of litigation each party normally must bear, subject only to specific provisions for shifting contained in statutes or rules. But the cost of particular discovery is a matter the judge is directed to take into account in exercising the authority to control dis - covery under Rule 26(b)(2). Among other things, that rule directs the judge to consider whether the information sought “is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive,” and to limit dis - covery if, in the circumstances of the case, its “expense . . . outweighs its likely benefits.” Protective orders are a means of implementing the proportionality principle underlying the discovery rules. Rule 26(c) permits the court to issue an order “to protect a party or person from . . . undue burden or expense,” including orders “that the discovery . . . may be had only on specified terms or condi - tions . . . [or] only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery.” Taken together, these provisions give the court broad authority to control the cost of discovery. They permit the court to impose not only limits but also condi - tions. The court can implement the cost/benefit rationale of the rule by condi - tioning particular discovery on payment of its costs by the party seeking it. Short of barring a party from conducting certain costly or marginally necessary discov - ery, the court may require that party to pay all or part of its cost as a condition to permitting it to proceed. Similarly, where a party insists on certain discovery to elicit information that may be available through less expensive methods, that dis - covery may be conditioned on the payment of the costs incurred by other parties. Such a protective order shifting certain costs may require payment at the time, or 167 . Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct., 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986); Globe Newspaper Co. v.

For example, where produc - tion is to be made of data maintained on computers, and the producing party is better able to search for and produce the data efficiently and economically than the discovering party, they may agree to use the former’s capability subject to ap - propriate reimbursement for costs. Where it is less expensive for a witness to travel to a deposition site than for several attorneys to travel to the witness’s resi - dence, the party seeking discovery may agree to pay the witness’s travel expenses. Cost allocation may also be an appropriate means to limit discovery that is unduly burdensome or expensive. Although it is not the purpose of Rule 26 to equalize the burdens on the parties, Rule 26(b)(2)(iii) expressly requires the court to take the parties’ resources into account in balancing the burden or expense of particular discovery against its benefit. Thus, where the parties’ resources are grossly disproportionate, the court may condition discovery that would be un duly burdensome on one of them upon a fair allocation of costs. Some of the factors relevant to cost allocation are: • What is the most efficient and economical way of obtaining the informa - tion? • Is the information of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of obtaining it? • Can one party obtain the information with less time and expense than another? • Should some or all of the costs be shifted between the parties, either abso - lutely or by an order conditional upon future events, 171 considering efficiency, economy, the significance of the information, and the relative resources of the parties? 170 .

Efficient management during discovery and trial requires careful planning and ongoing attention to the documentary phase of the litigation by the attorneys and the judge from the beginning of the litigation. 21.441 Identification System Document production under the Federal Rules may occur in a variety of ways. Production may be voluntary and informal. It may occur under Rule 34 (see infra section 21.443) or under Rule 33(d) by making documents available for inspec - tion. 172 Deponents may be required to produce documents by a subpoena duces tecum , 173 and nonparties may be commanded to produce documents by a sub - poena issued under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. 174 At the outset of the case, before any documents are produced or used in depositions, the court should direct counsel to establish a single system for identifying all documents produced (by any pro - cedure) or used in the litigation. To reduce the risk of confusion, each document should be assigned a single identifying designation that will be used by all parties for all purposes throughout the case, including depositions and trial. Usually consecutive numbering is the most practicable; blocks of numbers are assigned to each party in advance to make the source of each document immedi - ately apparent. Every page of every document is Bates-stamped consecutively. The numbers of each document may be later used to designate it; if identified differ - ently in the course of a deposition or on an exhibit list, the stamped number should be included as a cross-reference. If other means of designation are used, no designation should be assigned to more than one document, and the same 172 . Under Rule 33(d) the party may “specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained . . . in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.” If the in - formation sought exists in the form of compilations, abstracts, or summaries, these should be made available to the interrogating party.

In multitrack depositions, a block of numbers should be assigned to each deposition in advance. To avoid later disputes, a log should be kept recording each document produced and in - dicating by, to whom, and on what date production was made. A record of the documents produced by a party and copied by an opposing party may also be useful. Courts have traditionally given new designations to documents marked as exhibits for trial, often by assigning sequential numbers to one side and sequential letters to the other. The existence of duplicate designations of documents, how - ever, can be a source of confusion; exhibits can readily be marked for trial by their discovery designations. If desired, a supplemental designation can be used to identify the offering party. 21.442 Preservation Before the commencement of discovery—and perhaps before the initial confer - ence—the court should consider whether to enter an order requiring the parties to preserve and retain documents, files, and records that may be relevant to the litigation. 175 Because such an order may interfere with the normal operations of the parties and impose perhaps unforeseen burdens, the judge should discuss with counsel at the first opportunity the need for a preservation order and, if one is needed, what terms will best serve the purposes of preserving relevant matter without imposing undue burdens. A preservation order may be difficult to im - plement perfectly and cause hardship when records are stored in data-processing systems that automatically control the period of retention. Revision of existing computer programs to provide for longer retention, even if possible, may be prohibitively expensive (though print-out and retention of hard copies, or dupli - cation of databases at periodic intervals before deletions occur, may be feasible). Such an order should ordinarily permit destruction after reasonable notice to op - posing counsel; if opposing counsel objects, the party seeking destruction should be required to show good cause before destruction is permitted. The order may also exclude specified categories of documents whose cost of preservation is shown to outweigh substantially their relevance in the litigation, particularly if copies of the documents are filed in a document depository (see infra section 21.444) or if there are alternative sources for the information. If relevance cannot be fairly evaluated until the litigation progresses, destruction should be deferred. As issues in the case are narrowed, the court may reduce the scope of the order. The same considerations apply to the alteration or destruction of physical evi - dence. 175 . See Sample Order infra § 41.34."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 21.443 Rule 34 Requests/Procedures for Responding In litigation with voluminous documents, requests for production and responses can become mired in confusion unless carefully administered. Requests can be overlooked, responses can be lost in the shuffle, failures to respond can be ob - scured, and uncertainty can arise over what was requested and what was pro - duced. The process must therefore be handled with care, and the discovery plan should set in place procedures to that end. The starting point is strict observance of the requirements of Rule 34, under which requests to produce documents for inspection and copying must specify the items sought individually or by category and describe each with “reasonable particularity.” 176 Each request must specify a reasonable time, place, and man ner for inspection and copying. 177 A party served with a request must respond in writing within thirty days, stating for each item or category either that inspection and copying will be permitted as requested or that the party objects to the request; in the latter case, the reasons for the objection must be stated. If the re - sponding party objects to only part of an item or category, inspection of the re - maining parts must be permitted. Documents must be produced for inspection “as they are kept in the usual course of business” or organized and labeled “to correspond with the categories in the request.” The discovery plan should establish a schedule for submitting requests and responses, and for subsequent supplementation of responses under Rule 26(e). In developing the plan, the court should consider counsel’s proposals for document discovery and the possible imposition of limits based on Rule 26(b)(2). The court may initially limit production to the most relevant files or may require a prelimi - nary exchange of lists identifying files and documents from which the requesting party may then make selections. The court may also require, even if lead counsel or committees of counsel have not been appointed, that similarly situated parties confer and present joint Rule 34 requests and conduct their examinations at the same time and place; if extensive copying will be involved, counsel should con - sider whether economies may be achieved by sharing copies. In overseeing document production, the court should: • ensure that the burdens are fairly allocated between the parties; • prevent indiscriminate, overly broad, or unduly burdensome demands (the court should generally not permit sweeping requests, such as those for “all documents relating or referring to” an issue, party, or claim—re - quests should instead be framed to call for production of the fewest doc - uments possible; this may be facilitated by the use of prediscovery confer - 176 .

Requiring that all discovery materials be produced to and stored at one or more convenient locations, where they may be inspected and copied by parties seeking discovery, may reduce substantially the expense and burden of document production and inspection. Use of a depository also facilitates determination of which documents have been produced and what information is in them, minimizing the risk of later disputes. On the other hand, the cost of establishing and maintaining a central docu - ment depository may be substantial; before ordering or approving one, the court should satisfy itself that the cost is justified by the anticipated savings and other benefits. The court, in consultation with counsel, will need to allocate costs fairly among the parties, 178 considering their resources, extent of use of the deposi tory, and benefit derived from it. One way of allocating costs is to charge parties for each use of the depository. The charge should be set no higher than necessary to cover costs; a depository should not be a profit-making enterprise. Special ar - rangements for less affluent parties may be needed to ensure fair access. It may be necessary to appoint an administrator to operate the depository, with the cost allocated among the parties. 179 If document depositories have been established in related cases in other courts, counsel may be able to arrange for their joint use, sharing the expense; likewise, consideration should be given to the requests of litigants in other cases, wherever pending, to use a depository es - tablished in the case before the court. Where significant costs are involved, the court should consider periodic assessments to fund operations, usually beginning with the order establishing the depository. To establish a depository, counsel and the court must first select a suitable location. If sufficient space is available in the courthouse, planning should be co - 178 . The cost of establishing and maintaining a central document depository is not a “taxable cost” under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). In re San Juan, 964 F.2d 956, 964 (1st Cir. 1993).

More often space will need to be acquired in another adequately sized and conveniently located building. 180 Counsel and the court should collaborate in establishing a regime for the operation of the deposi - tory, including procedures for acquisition, numbering, indexing, and storing of discovery materials and rules governing when and by whom documents may be examined and copied. 181 If a party objects to depositing documents in a central depository, the court may enter an order under Rule 26(c)(2) directing produc - tion at the depository (or the place designated by the requesting parties) or permit the producing party at its expense to furnish copies to all parties. The availability of technology such as CD-ROM and other optical discs on which discovery materials can be recorded in computer-accessible form can result in substantial savings. The court may direct that some or all discovery materials be “imaged” on discs, which then may be distributed to parties seeking discov- ery 182 (special provision for the retention of originals may be necessary). Because a single disc can store a large amount of information, voluminous dis covery materials can thus be distributed much more conveniently and inexpen sively. 183 Computerized search and retrieval of information on a disc can facilitate review of voluminous discovery materials, particularly if adequately in dexed. 184 Computerization of discovery documents may be either an alternative or a supplement to the use of a central document depository. For more on this technology, see infra sections 34.33–34.34, 34.37. 21.445 Evidentiary Foundation for Documents The production of documents, either in the traditional manner or by filing in a document depository, will not necessarily provide the foundation for admission of those documents into evidence at trial or for use on motion for summary judgment.

Such data include not only conventional information but also such things as operating systems (programs that control a computer’s basic functions), applications (programs used directly by the operator, such as word processing or spreadsheet programs), computer-generated models, and other sets of instructions residing in computer memory. Any discovery plan must address the relevant issues, such as the search for, location, retrieval, form of production and inspection, preservation, and use at trial of information stored in mainframe or personal computers or accessible “online.” For the most part, such data will reflect information generated and maintained in the ordinary course of business. Some computerized data, how - ever, may have been compiled in anticipation of or for use in the litigation (and may therefore be entitled to protection as trial preparation materials). Discovery requests may themselves be transmitted in computer-accessible form; interroga - tories served on computer disks, for example, could then be answered using the same disk, avoiding the need to retype them. Finally, computerized data may form the contents for a common document depository (see supra section 21.444). Some of the relevant issues to be considered follow: Form of production. Rule 34 provides for the production, inspection, and copying of computerized data (i.e., “data compilations from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by the respondent through detection devices into reasonably usable form”); Rule 33(d) permits parties to answer inter - rogatories by making available for inspection and copying business records, in - cluding “compilations,” where “the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served.” The court will need to consider, among other things, whether production and inspection should be in computer-readable form (such as by translation onto CD-ROM disks) or of printouts (hard copies); what information the producing party must be required to provide (such as manuals and similar materials) to fa - cilitate the requesting party’s access to and inspection of the producing party’s data; whether to require the parties to agree on a standard format for production 185 .

Broad database searches may be necessary, and this may expose confidential or ir - relevant data to the opponent’s scrutiny unless appropriate safeguards are in - stalled. Similarly, some data may be maintained in the form of compilations that may themselves be entitled to trade secret protection or that reflect attorney work product, having been prepared by attorneys in contemplation of litigation. Data may have been compiled, for example, to produce studies and tabulations for use at trial or as a basis for expert opinions. 188 Use at trial. In general, the Federal Rules of Evidence apply to computerized data as they do to other types of evidence. 189 Computerized data may, however, raise unique issues concerning the accuracy and authenticity of the database. Accuracy may be impaired as a result of incorrect or incomplete entry of data, mistakes in output instructions, programming errors, damage and contamination of storage media, power outages, and equipment malfunctions. The proponent of computerized evidence has the burden of laying a proper foundation by establish - 186 . For example, the parties may agree on a particular computer program or language and the method of data storage. See Martha A. Mills, Discovery of Computerized Information, Legal Times Seminar, June 22, 1993, at tab 6. 187 . See infra § 21.433 re protective orders allocating costs. See also National Union Elec. Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd., 494 F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. Pa. 1980) (Becker, J.). 188 . Rule 26(a)(2)(B) requires that, unless otherwise stipulated or ordered, a party must dis close in advance of trial (among other things) “the data or other information considered by” an expert witness in forming the opinions to be expressed. However, records computerized for “litigation support” purposes, not considered by an expert or intended for use at trial, may be pro tected trial preparation materials under Rule 26(b)(3) to the extent that they reveal counsel’s decisions as to which records to computerize and how to organize them. 189 .

For example, the “business records” exception to the hearsay rule applies to a “data compilation, in any form.” Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).

In such cases, verification may be made of a sample of the data. Instead of correcting the errors detected in the sample—which might lead to the erroneous representation that the compilation is free from error—evidence may be offered (or stipulations made) by way of extrapolation from the sample of the effect of the observed errors on the entire compilation. Alternatively, it may be feasible to use statistical methods to determine the probability and range of error. The complexity, general unfamiliarity, and rapidly changing character of the technology involved in the management of computerized materials may at times make it appropriate for the court to seek the assistance of a special master or neutral expert. Alternatively, the parties may be called on to provide the court with expert assistance, in the form of briefings on the relevant technological is - sues. 21.447 Discovery from Nonparties Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(c), a nonparty may be compelled to produce and allow copying of documents and other tangibles or submit to an inspection by service of a subpoena under Rule 45; the producing person need not be deposed or even appear personally. 192 A party seeking such production has a duty to take rea - sonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on the person subpoe - naed. 193 Objections to production must be made in writing by the subpoenaed person; the requesting party must then move for an order to compel produc- 190 . The proponent is not required, however, to prove that the tabulation is free from all possible error. Authentication may be provided by “[e]vidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result.” Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(9). The standard for authenticity “is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.” Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). In the case of summaries, accuracy is an issue “for the trier of fact to determine as in the case of other issues of fact.” Fed. R. Evid. 1008. Accordingly, the existence or possibility of errors usually affects only the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence, except when the problems are so significant as to call for exclusion under Rule 403. Of course, if computerized data provided by a party are offered against that party, inquiry into the accuracy of the data may be unnecessary. 191 . The court may order that any objections to the foundation, accuracy, or reliability of data are deemed waived unless raised during pretrial (or good cause is shown for the failure to object).

They are, however, often over-used and conducted inefficiently. As a result, depositions tend to be the most costly and time-consuming activity in complex litigation. Management of litigation should therefore be directed at avoiding un - necessary depositions, limiting the number and length of those that are taken, and ensuring that the process of taking depositions is conducted as fairly and efficiently as possible. 21.451 Limitations and Controls Depositions should be limited to those that are necessary. In determining neces - sity, counsel should consider the purpose for which any particular deposition is to be taken. Depositions can serve three purposes: • to obtain relevant information from knowledgeable witnesses; • to perpetuate the testimony of witnesses who may be unavailable at trial; and • to commit adverse witnesses to their testimony. While the latter two purposes are uniquely served by depositions, the first, obtain ing information, can often be accomplished more quickly and less expensively by a variety of formal and informal discovery devices (see infra 194 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(2)(B). 195 . Id. 196 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3). 197 . 5 U.S.C. § 552."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 83 section 21.452). In developing the discovery plan, counsel should determine that each proposed de position will serve a useful and necessary purpose and that it will be relevant to material issues in dispute and not cumulative. The court, of course, has broad authority to limit depositions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A) and 31(a)(2)(A) impose a presumptive limit of ten depositions each for plaintiffs, defendants, and third-party defendants (local rules may also restrict the number of depositions). While the parties may stipulate around the pre - sumptive limit, the court has final authority under Rule 26(b)(2) to limit the number and length of depositions. Rule 30(d)(2) provides additional authority to control the length of depositions (as do some local rules). Limits on depositions may also be imposed indirectly by the setting of the trial date or a discovery cutoff date. In large-stake cases, such limits can be evaded by multitrack discovery (concurrent depositions) in the absence of a further order by the court. 198 The court’s authority should be exercised on the basis of the information provided by the parties bearing on the need for the proposed depositions, the subject matter to be covered, and the available alternatives. The extent to which the judge considers each particular deposition, categories of depositions, or only the deposition program as a whole will depend on the circumstances of each liti - gation; the court may, for example, condition the taking of certain depositions, such as those of putative class members, on prior court approval. The judge’s in - volvement in the development of this phase of the discovery plan should, how - ever, be sufficient to establish meaningful control over the time and resources to be expended. Aside from setting appropriate limits, the judge should also be con - cerned with the time and place of taking the depositions, including proposed travel, and the methods to be used for recording. 199 To ensure that the limits placed on depositions in the discovery plan are not frustrated by abusive practices, the court should insist on observance of rules for the fair and efficient conduct of depositions. Rule 30(d)(1) requires that objec - tions be stated “concisely and in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive man - ner”; local rules or standing orders may also establish guidelines for objec tions. 200 Rule 30(d)(1) allows counsel to instruct a deponent not to answer only for the purpose of preserving a privilege 201 or enforcing a court-imposed limi tation on evidence, or in preparation for a motion under Rule 30(d)(3) to limit or terminate the examination for bad faith or harassment; more stringent limitations 198 . Despite their cost and the potential for unfairness, such “multiple track” depositions may be a practical necessity to expedite cases in which time is of the essence. See infra § 21.454. 199 . See Sample Order infra § 41.38 (deposition guidelines). 200 . See, e.g., Rule 12, Standing Orders of the Court on Effective Discovery in Civil Cases (E.D.N.Y. 1984). 201 . To the extent possible, disputed claims of privilege should be resolved in advance of the deposition."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third may be imposed by local rule or by court order when necessary. 202 In addition, some courts issue guidelines covering matters including the following: • who may attend depositions; • where the depositions are to be taken; • who may question the witness; • how the parties are to allocate the costs; and • how the attorneys are to conduct themselves. 203 Rule 30(d)(2) expressly authorizes sanctions for persons responsible for “impediment, delay or other conduct that has frustrated the fair examination of the deponent.” Inefficient management of documents at deposition can interfere with its proper conduct. The discovery plan should establish procedures for marking de - position exhibits, handling copies and originals, and exchanging in advance all papers about which the examining party intends to question the witness (except those to be used for genuine impeachment). 204 21.452 Cost-Saving Measures In addition to the general discovery practices discussed in supra section 21.42, techniques which may be helpful in streamlining deposition discovery include the following: • Informal interviews . Informal interviews of potential witnesses may be arranged with the agreement of counsel. 205 This procedure may be useful for persons who have only limited knowledge or involvement and who are unlikely to be called as witnesses at trial. If counsel desire, the witness may be sworn and the interview recorded electronically for pos sible use 202 . See, e.g., Article VI(6) of the Civil Justice Expense and Delay Reduction Plan for the Eastern District of Texas (complete prohibition on instructions not to answer except to assert privilege). The court may prohibit counsel from even conferring with the deponent during interrogation for any purpose but deciding whether to assert a privilege. See Hall v. Clifton Precision, 150 F.R.D. 525 (E.D. Pa. 1993); Rule 13, Standing Orders of the Court on Effective Discovery in Civil Cases (E.D.N.Y. 1984). 203 . See Sample Order infra § 41.38. 204 . See, e.g., section IX.H(12) of the San Juan Order, supra note 179 (five days advance no tice). 205 . An attorney may not communicate with a represented party without the consent of that party’s counsel. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2. If the represented party is an organi - zation, the prohibition extends to persons with managerial responsibility and any other person whose act or omission may be imputed to the organization or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization. See id. comment. The prohibition does not extend to former corporate employees. ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 91-359 (1991).

Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the party taking a deposition may record it on audio or videotape instead of stenographically without having it transcribed. 207 Any other party may make its own tape recording of the deposition. 208 Videotaped depositions offer a number of advantages: they help deter misconduct by coun sel at the deposition; they can preserve the testimony of witnesses who may be unavailable to testify at trial (such as experts having scheduling conflicts preventing their appearance at trial or persons suffering from an infirmity) and in dispersed litigation can avoid multiple live appearances by the same witness; they tend to hold a jury’s attention better than the reading of a deposition transcript and help the jury assess the witness’s demeanor and credibility; and they are more effective in helping clients considering settlement to evaluate the quality of the opposition’s case. On the other hand, editing tape for showing in court to eliminate objection - able and irrelevant material may be difficult and time-consuming. 209 Safeguards may be necessary, such as having (1) the videotape operator sworn and certify the correctness and completeness of the recording; (2) the deponent sworn on tape; (3) the recording device run continuously throughout the deposition; and (4) counsel agree to (or having the court order) standard technical procedures to avoid distortion. 210 Both sides may record a deposition, each bearing its own expense. 206 . Although the use of such a statement at trial is more limited than that of a deposition, it may be useful for impeachment. 207 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(2). With the concurrence of the deponent, a written transcript often may be deferred until need for it arises, and, even then, only parts of the deposition may need to be transcribed. Counsel can save additional time by entering into a stipulation (with the deponent’s consent) waiving presentation to the deponent. 208 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(3). 209 . See Spangler v. Sears Roebuck and Co., 138 F.R.D. 122, 126 n.3 (S.D. Ind. 1992) (setting out guidelines for use of videotaped depositions at trial). To facilitate this process, and for ease of reference at trial, the court may require the creation of a log index identifying the location on the tape of each stage of the examination and every objection, as well as other information. See Michael J. Henke, The Taking and Use of Videotaped Depositions , 16 Am. J. Trial Advoc. 151, 160 n.45 (1992); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 28 F. R. Serv. 2d 993, 996 (1980). 210 . These procedures might cover such matters as the use of zoom lens, lighting, back ground, and camera angle. See Henke, supra note 209, at 158. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(4) requires that “[t]he appearance or demeanor of deponents or attorneys shall not be distorted through camera or sound- recording techniques.”"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • Telephonic depositions. The use of telephonic depositions can reduce travel costs. 211 Supplemental examination by parties not present when a person was first deposed may be conducted effectively by telephone. Through use of speaker phones, conference calls, or video teleconferenc - ing, distant witnesses (such as a willing witness located abroad) may be examined by counsel from counsel’s offices, with the court reporter lo - cated with the witness or, by stipulation, at one of the attorneys’ offices (see infra section 21.494, extraterritorial discovery). A telephonic deposi - tion may also be recorded nonstenographically. Telephonic depositions are most often used for examinations that are expected to be relatively brief and do not involve numerous documents, but may also be used to avoid last-minute continuances or trial interruptions when deposition testimony becomes unexpectedly necessary. To ensure that deponents are not coached, ground rules should specify who may be present with the deponent during the examination. • Conference depositions. In special situations, such as a Rule 30(b)(6) de - position of an organization, several persons may be deposed simultane - ously (in person or by telephone) in a conference setting. 212 • Representative depositions. Where there are many potential nonparty witnesses, typically in the case of eyewitnesses, counsel may agree on a few representative depositions and stipulate that the testimony of other named witnesses would be the same. • Written questions. In some circumstances, the rarely used procedures of Fed. R. Civ. P. 31 for depositions on written questions may be a cost - effective means of obtaining trial evidence. For example, Rule 31 deposi - tion questions—unlike interrogatories—may be directed to nonparties and the answers used at trial to provide evidentiary foundation for doc - uments. Rule 31 questions may also be useful in follow-up examinations by absent or later-added parties of persons whose depositions have been taken earlier. • Reduction in copies. Costs can be controlled by limiting the number of copies of deposition transcripts ordered, particularly if a document de - pository is established; waiving filing of the original with the court; and not having transcripts prepared of depositions that turn out to be of no value. 211 . Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(7), the court may order or the parties may stipulate to tak ing of a deposition by telephonic “or other remote electronic means.” 212 . See supra § 21.423."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 87 • Limited attendance. Limits may be set on the number of attorneys for each party or each side who may attend depositions, particularly in cases in which fees may be awarded or approved by the court. Restraint can also be encouraged by the use of deferred supplemental depositions (see infra section 21.453). Nonattending counsel may, of course, suggest top - ics for examination to colleagues who will be attending, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c) allows parties to serve sealed written questions, which the presid - ing officer will propound to the deponent. Nonattending counsel may also listen to key depositions by telephone and suggest additional ques - tions to their representatives at recesses. In the exceptional case where the expense is justified, counsel may arrange for computer-assisted steno - graphic reporting, allowing the court reporter’s stenographic notes to be telephonically transmitted to terminals located in attorneys’ offices in other cities. 21.453 Deferred Supplemental Depositions In multiparty cases the court should consider an order relieving parties of the risk of nonattendance at depositions in which they have only a peripheral inter est. 213 Such an order may provide that a copy of the deposition transcript will promptly be made available to nonattending parties, who within a specified pe riod thereafter may conduct supplemental examination of the deponent, 214 either by appearing in person at a designated time and place for resumption of the deposition or by presenting questions in written form under Rule 31 or in a tele - phonic deposition under Rule 30(b)(7). The order should specify whether the ab - sent party has the right to require resumption of the adjourned deposition or—as is usually preferable—must show cause why resumption is necessary. The order should also state whether the initial examination is admissible at trial if the depo - nent later becomes unavailable for supplemental examination. These procedures are designed to relieve parties, particularly those with lim - ited financial resources, from incurring the expense of attending depositions in which their interest is minimal or will likely be adequately protected by others in attendance. They should not be used as a tactical device to harass witnesses or to inconvenience other parties. Counsel for litigants with a substantial interest in a deposition should attend or be represented by other counsel. The court should also provide for the use of depositions against persons who may become parties to the litigation by later amendment of the pleadings or the filing, removal, or transfer of related cases. The order may state that all previously 213 . See Sample Order infra § 41.38. 214 . A stipulation or court order will be required to depose a person who has already been deposed in the case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(B)."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third taken depositions will be deemed binding on new parties unless, within a specified period after their appearance in the litigation, they show cause to the contrary. Even in the absence of such an order, resumption of earlier depositions should be controlled and limited to questioning relevant to the new parties. Like other parties who have not attended a deposition, the new parties are typically given a specified period of time to conduct supplemental examination of the de - ponents, although the court may require that some need for additional question - ing be shown. Repetition of earlier examination can be avoided by having depo - nents adopt their earlier testimony. 21.454 Scheduling The scheduling of depositions involves the sequencing of depositions in relation to other discovery, 215 the order in which witnesses are to be deposed, and the setting of times and places to which all of the attorneys and witnesses can be committed. General considerations concerning the sequencing of discovery have been discussed at supra section 21.422. How depositions should be sequenced with respect to other discovery in the litigation calls for careful consideration. Often, discovery intended to identify persons knowledgeable on specific matters and secure production of documents relevant to their examination should precede the taking of depositions. In some cases, however, the early deposition of a central witness can provide information critical to further proceedings, including settle - ment negotiations. Similarly, the order of depositions depends on the circum - stances. The discovery plan should not assume that all potentially relevant depo - sitions will invariably be taken; other things being equal, it is preferable to begin with witnesses crucial to the case before embarking on depositions of peripheral persons. Depositions relevant to a prospective motion for summary judgment or the early trial of a severed issue should precede those that might be obviated by a ruling on the motion or trial. Ordinarily, discovery by all parties proceeds concurrently. One purpose of a discovery plan is to establish an orderly procedure and avoid indiscriminate noticing of depositions, which may result in inconvenience, harassment, and inefficiency. Dates and witnesses for depositions should be scheduled to accom - plish the objectives of the discovery plan, minimize travel and other expense, and make reasonable accommodation of parties, counsel, and witnesses. A plan might set specific dates for specific witness or set aside specified time periods during which designated parties are given either exclusive or preferential rights to 215 . Absent stipulation or court order, depositions may not be taken before the Rule 26(f) discovery conference unless the notice is accompanied by a certification, with supporting facts, that the person to be examined is expected to leave the country and be unavailable for examination in this country unless deposed before that time. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(C), 26(d)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 89 schedule depositions, subject to exceptions for emergencies. Arrangements should be sought with deponents to take their depositions at a convenient central location, such as the place where a document depository and perhaps counsel are located; the parties may find it economical to share such witnesses’ travel ex - penses to avoid the expense of having counsel travel to distant depositions. Parties should be expected to work out these arrangements with little involve - ment by the court other than to lend assistance when needed. When depositions cannot be scheduled at times or places convenient to all counsel, attorneys should try to arrange for participation by others from their offices or counsel representing litigants with similar interests. Moreover, to meet discovery deadlines, it may be necessary to conduct depositions on a “multiple track” basis, with depositions of several different witnesses being taken at the same time in one or more locations. 21.455 Coordination with Related Litigation Discovery plans in related cases pending before the same judge should be coordi - nated to avoid conflicts and duplication. If the cases are pending before different judges, counsel should nevertheless attempt to coordinate the depositions of common witnesses and other common discovery. Examination regarding subjects of interest only to particular cases may be deferred until the conclusion of direct and cross-examination on matters of common interest. Parties may also stipulate to the use in related cases of depositions taken in one particular case. Economies may also be achieved when parties in the present litigation have access to depositions previously taken in other litigation (see also supra section 21.423). Depositions of opposing parties and their employees are generally ad - missible against such parties under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Depositions of other witnesses may be usable for impeachment under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). In other situations, such as those involving nonparties or a party’s own witnesses, a new deposition may be necessary, but (with advance notice) the answers given at the earlier deposition may be adopted as the current testimony of the witness, subject to supplementation; telephonic nonstenographic depositions may be used for this purpose at little cost to either side. See infra section 31 on coordination with related litigation. 21.456 Control of Abusive Conduct As noted above, to prevent frustration of the discovery plan the court needs to insist on counsel’s observance of the rules for the fair and efficient conduct of de - positions. See supra section 21.451. Those rules include Rules 30(d)(1) and (3), local rules, and the judge’s standing orders; some judges have also issued written guidelines that advise attorneys how the judge expects discovery to be conducted. The likelihood of problematic conduct will be greatly reduced if the court informs counsel at the outset of the litigation of its expectations with respect to the con -"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third duct of depositions, including speaking and argumentative objections, instruc - tions not to answer, coaching of witnesses (including restrictions during recesses in the deposition), 216 and evasive or obstructive conduct by witnesses. (See supra section 21.451, Sample Order infra section 41.38.) A speedy and efficient procedure to resolve discovery disputes also helps (see supra section 21.424). In cases where abuses are rampant, the court may require that depositions be videotaped for judicial review or may require counsel to expeditiously deliver a copy of the transcript of each deposition for review by the court. Alternatively, the court may direct that one or more depositions be supervised in person by a judge, magistrate judge, or special master. The judicial officer or special master may need to be present only briefly, setting the tone and making a few early rul - ings, and then remain on call. Even where a special master is appointed to exer - cise continuous oversight, the resulting savings in avoiding disputes and satellite litigation may justify the cost. Some judges have required that depositions be taken in court to allow periodic monitoring. In rare cases, sanctions may need to be imposed. Although sanctions may have a prophylactic effect for later depositions, they will do little to cure the dam - age that has already occurred and may further poison relations between counsel. They should therefore be a last resort. See supra section 20.15. 21.46 Interrogatories .461 Purposes 90 .462 Limitations 91 .463 Responses 92 .464 Other Practices to Save Time and Expense 92 Used with care and restraint, interrogatories can be a useful device to supplement other discovery methods, mainly to obtain specific factual information. Because interrogatories are often poorly drafted, misused, or employed to burden and ha - rass an opponent, courts generally restrict the number permitted. Counsel will therefore have to make the best use of the limited number of interrogatories likely to be allowed through skillful and thoughtful drafting designed to accomplish a legitimate purpose. 21.461 Purposes Interrogatories primarily serve the purpose of determining the existence, identity, and location of witnesses, documents, and other tangible evidence as a prerequi - site to planning of further discovery. Much of this type of information is subject to prediscovery disclosure under the Federal Rules or local rules and, even if not, 216 . See Hall v. Clifton Precision, 150 F.R.D. 525 (E.D. Pa. 1993)."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 91 can be required to be exchanged by the court under a discovery order. See supra sections 21.13, 21.423. Interrogatories may be useful in filling gaps and ensuring full compliance with informal requests, obtaining information dispersed among a number of persons under the opponent’s control, and gathering technical infor - mation when the requesting party may need assistance from an expert in formu - lating precise questions and the answering party may need time and special assis - tance to respond (e.g., when discovery is sought concerning systems and pro - grams for the storage and retrieval of computerized data). Contention interrogatories may sometimes be useful in defining issues, though the procedures discussed in supra section 21.33 are usually more produc - tive in clarifying and narrowing issues and the contentions of the parties. Rule 33(c) permits interrogatories calling for “an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact,” but permits the court to defer an answer “until after designated discovery has been completed or until a pretrial conference or other later time.” Before contention interrogatories are filed, the court should consider whether they are likely to be useful at that stage of the proceeding and should ensure that they will not be argumentative. Interrogatories may also be used, either alone or in conjunction with requests for admission under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 (see infra section 21.47), to provide the foundation for a summary judgment motion. Whether certain facts are genuinely in dispute may be difficult to ascertain from depositions and affidavits, and even in response to Rule 36 requests the opposing party may state that, although rea - sonable inquiry has been made, it can neither admit nor deny the truth of particu lar matters that depend on the credibility of third persons. Interrogatories are a means to require a party to disclose any facts asserted to raise a triable issue with respect to particular elements of a claim or defense. Interrogatories should never be used for cross-examination or to elicit argu - mentative answers. Except in certain specialized areas of practice, form or pattern interrogatories are generally regarded as unacceptable. 21.462 Limitations Rule 33(a) imposes a presumptive limit of twenty-five interrogatories, including subparts, per party, and many local rules also restrict the number of interrogato - ries that may be propounded without stipulation or a court order.

Rule 26(e)(2) requires parties to seasonably amend interroga tory responses if, as new information comes to light, the responding party learns that a response—even if complete and correct when made—is now incomplete or incorrect (unless this information has otherwise been made known to opposing parties during discovery or in writing). The discovery plan should schedule peri - odic dates for review and amendment of interrogatory responses (see supra sec - tion 21.421). If an answer is withheld on privilege grounds, the claim must be ac - companied by a description of the information withheld sufficient to enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege. 220 Answers must be signed by the person making them, and objections by attorneys, subject to the certification required by Rule 26(g) when propounding and responding to interrogato ries. 221 Some courts require that responses to contention interrogatories be signed by counsel; others permit a party to sign, stating in substance, “I have been advised by my attorneys that . . . ”—but such a statement may waive the attor ney–client privilege. 21.464 Other Practices to Save Time and Expense Use of the following techniques may increase the effectiveness and efficiency of interrogatories: • Master interrogatories; precluding duplicate requests. Similarly situated parties may be required to confer and develop a single or master set of 217 . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). 218 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(3) requires answers and objections to be served within thirty days of service unless the parties stipulate otherwise.

If interrogatories have already been served by one party, other parties should be barred from asking the same questions since any party may use the answers to inter - rogatories served by another regardless of who propounded the inter - rogatory. 222 • Use of interrogatories from other litigation. Parties may also be barred from propounding interrogatories that an adversary has already answered in other litigation, when such answers are available or may be made avail - able by the adversary. 223 • Successive responses. If some questions will require substantially more investigation than others, counsel may stipulate that the responding party will provide answers in stages as the information is obtained, rather than seek additional time for the first response. Fed. R. Civ. P. 29(2) requires court approval of stipulations extending the time to respond to interroga - tories only if they would interfere with court-ordered time limits (see supra section 21.423). • Modified responses. When interrogatories seek information that the re - sponding party lacks or can obtain only with significant expenditure of time and money, and the information can be provided in a different form, that party should not object but rather advise the opponent and at - tempt to reach agreement on an acceptable form of response. For exam - ple, information requested on a calendar year basis may be readily avail - able on a fiscal year basis, or information on overtime hours may be de - rived from records of compensation rates and overtime paid. • Early resolution of disputes. The parties may be required to object to in - terrogatories before expiration of the time for filing answers, particularly in cases where more than the standard thirty-day period is allowed for filing answers. The parties should promptly attempt to resolve the objec - tions by modifying or clarifying the troublesome interrogatories. If ne - gotiations are unsuccessful, the parties should present their dispute to the court in a clear and concise manner, avoiding lengthy motions and briefs, and the court should rule promptly to avoid disruption of the progress of the litigation (see supra section 21.424). 222 . See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). 223 . See id."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • Informal discovery. Counsel should attempt to informally exchange in - formation that would otherwise be elicited by interrogatories. Interrogatories may then be used to create a record admissible at trial. 224 • Rule 30(b)(6) depositions. When a party seeks discovery from an organi - zation but does not know the identity of individuals with relevant knowl - edge, the party may name the organization as the deponent, requiring it to designate persons to testify in response. This avoids the need for the two-step process of using an interrogatory to discover the identity of knowledgeable individuals and then deposing them individually. 21.47 Stipulations of Fact/Requests for Admission Stipulations of fact. Stipulations of fact can reduce the time and expense both of pretrial proceedings and the trial itself. Rule 16(c)(1) provides that at any pretrial conference, the court “may take appropriate action, with respect to . . . the pos - sibility of obtaining admissions of fact . . . which will avoid unnecessary proof . . . . ” Although premature efforts to obtain stipulations may be counter - productive, 225 the judge should encourage stipulations of facts that, after an ap - propriate opportunity for discovery has been afforded, should no longer be gen - uinely in doubt. Admission should be expected not only of facts of which each party has personal knowledge, but also of those that can be established by evi - dence from others. If the parties insist, facts of the latter type may be shown as “uncontested,” “uncontroverted,” or “conceded” rather than as “admitted,” but with the same effect in the litigation. Stipulations may be sought with respect both to the facts of the case and to matters that affect the admissibility of other evidence, such as the authenticity of records and the foundation requirements for exceptions to the hearsay rule under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) and similar provisions. Parties may be more willing to enter into stipulations for specified limited pur - poses, such as an injunction proceeding, motion for summary judgment, or bi - furcated trial of an issue. They may be willing to enter early stipulations if provi - sion is made, analogous to that in Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b), for timely withdrawal from an incorrect stipulation on the basis of newly discovered evidence when no substantial prejudice to other parties would result. The court can assist the stipulation process by stressing the distinction be - tween conceding the truth of some fact or agreeing not to contest it, and conced - ing its admissibility or weight. Counsel’s admission of the truth of an uncontro - verted fact does not affect the right to object to its admissibility or to contest its 224 . Interrogatory answers are admissible to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(c). 225 . Consideration should be given, however, to the early use of the combined discovery request described in supra § 21.423, in which a party may admit that particular facts are true in lieu of proceeding with other discovery regarding those matters."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Pretrial Procedures 95 probative value. Indeed, if a party contends that some fact is irrelevant or oth - erwise inadmissible, there is less reason not to admit to its truth without the ex - haustive investigation and discovery that might be warranted for an obviously critical fact. A party may stipulate to the accuracy of tabulations and compilations whose significance it intends to dispute. 226 The parties may also be reminded of the tactical disadvantages of contesting at trial some matter on which their opponents will certainly prevail or, indeed, of being confronted at trial with an earlier denial of some matter that could not have been fairly disputed. Since an angry client, rather than the attorney, is often the person responsible for an “admit nothing” posture in the litigation, the court may direct that the clients themselves attend a conference at which the desirability of early stipulations is discussed. Appointment of a special master may at times assist the parties in arriving at stipulations. Requests for admission. When voluntary means to narrow factual disputes have been exhausted, admissions may be obtained under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36. The rule’s advantage is that it prescribes procedures, responsibilities, and conse - quences respecting admissions. It has its limitations, however. As discussed in supra section 21.463, complementary or supplementary interrogatories may be needed if a party in apparent good faith declines to admit the truth of some fact that depends on the credibility of other witnesses. In addition, like interrogato - ries, Rule 36 admissions are usable only against the party who made them and only in the action in which they were made. In multiparty litigation, requests may therefore have to be directed to each party in each related action. 227 Because parties often deny a requested admission on the basis of a trivial disagreement with a statement or without indicating the portions of the stated fact that are true, the court should urge the parties to observe their obligation under the rule to re - spond in good faith, and point out the availability of sanctions for failure to do so. 228 Statements of contentions and proof. The limitations of Rule 36 and the difficulties often encountered when attorneys attempt, even in good faith, to ne - gotiate stipulations of fact have led to the use of a third method for arriving at 226 . Caution should be exercised in requiring a party to admit the accuracy of voluminous data or summaries of the same. As discussed in supra § 21.446, a response based on some limited study may be more appropriate even though this results in a summary with known errors. 227 . Rule 36 requests answered by a party in prior or related litigation should be renewed; a simple new request that asks the party to admit each matter previously admitted should suffice. 228 . “[W]hen good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a). Sanctions are available under Rule 37(c)(2). Marchaud v.

Counsel for one side, typically the plaintiff’s, are or - dered by the court to draft a series of numbered, narrative statements of objective facts which they believe can be established, avoiding argumentative language, la - bels, and legal conclusions. 229 Opposing counsel must then indicate which of the proposed facts are admitted (or will not be contested) and which are disputed, specifying the nature of the disagreement by appropriate interlineation or dele - tion, as well as drafting narrative statements of additional facts that they believe can be established. The newly added statements are then returned to the first party for admission (or nondenial) or for specific disagreement. A consolidated statement reflecting what is agreed and what remains in dispute is then filed with the court as a stipulation of the parties. The court may incorporate the stipulation in a pretrial order, specifically providing that all (or only specified) objections to admissibility at trial are reserved. This procedure for narrowing factual issues may be employed as one of the final steps before trial, coupled with a provision precluding a party from offering at trial evidence of any fact not included in the narrative listing, except for good cause shown. It may also be used earlier in the litigation (after adequate oppor - tunity for discovery) with respect to specified proceedings, such as a class certification hearing or a Rule 56 motion. Whether all facts that the party pro - poses to prove must be listed—or only those that may possibly be admitted and, if admitted, would reduce the scope of evidence presented—will depend on the circumstances of the case. The more extensive the required listing, the greater the opportunity to narrow the facts that remain for proof at trial; the judge should, however, weigh the potential for reduction in the length and cost of trial against the time and expense expended in identifying facts that will probably remain in dispute. The degree to which stipulations can be obtained may depend not so much on the procedures used as on the attitude of the parties. Attorneys are sometimes reluctant to make concessions that will ease their opponents’ burden. The judge may be able to persuade counsel that, in addition to fulfilling their responsibilities as officers of the court, they will serve their clients’ interests by streamlining the litigation through appropriate concessions and admissions. The refusal to stipu - late provable facts almost never results in an advantage through a failure of proof and usually imposes additional costs on both sides in discovery, at trial, or both. Requests for judicial notice. The judicial notice procedure provided by Fed. R. Evid. 201 may also be used to eliminate the need for some fact finding at trial.

Some judges have found it useful to confer with counsel before experts are retained to testify, to determine whether the proposed testimony will be necessary and appropriate, and to establish limits on the number of expert witnesses and the subjects they will cover. Management of the disclosure and discovery of expert opinions is also essen - tial to ensure adequate preparation by the parties, avoid surprise at trial, and fa - cilitate rulings on the admissibility of expert evidence. Trial experts. Rule 26(a)(2) requires the prediscovery disclosure by the par - ties of the identity of expert witnesses 232 to be called at trial and extensive addi- tional information: • a signed written report stating all opinions to which the expert will testify; • the bases for those opinions; • the data or information considered in forming the opinions; 233 • exhibits to be introduced as a summary or in support of the opinions; • the expert’s qualifications (including a list of all publications authored in the last ten years); • the compensation the expert is to receive; and • a list of other cases in which the expert has testified within the last four years. 234 230 . For more detailed discussion of the management of expert testimony, see Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence (Federal Judicial Center 1994). 231 . See infra §§ 33.22, 33.27–33.28, 33.35, 33.65, 33.73. 232 . The rule applies only to experts “retained or specially employed” to give expert testimony or “whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony,” but the court may extend the rule to other experts, such as treating physicians (or, conversely, waive it as to certain experts).

P. 26(a)(2)(A), (B)."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third Similar requirements may be contained in local rules or standing orders, and the court may itself enter an order adapting these requirements to meet the needs of the litigation. At the initial conference, the court should establish a timetable for expert disclosure 235 and such other procedures as may be needed to implement it. Scheduling should take into account that the parties may lack sufficient informa - tion to select expert witnesses until the issues have been further defined and cer - tain discovery completed; a party’s decision may also await the disclosure of the opinions of experts selected by other parties. 236 Disclosure must, however, be made sufficiently in advance of trial for the parties to take depositions if neces - sary, 237 and for the court to conduct appropriate pretrial proceedings, such as hearing motions under Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) directed at expert evidence and mo - tions for summary judgment. 238 Experts may wish to modify or refine their disclosed opinions in the light of further studies, opinions expressed by other experts, or other developments in the litigation. Although Rule 26(e)(1) requires that opposing counsel be advised of these changes, a final cutoff date should be set by which all additions and revi - sions must be disclosed to be admissible at trial. 239 Early and full disclosure of expert evidence can have an impact on efforts to define and narrow issues. Although experts often seem hopelessly at odds, when the assumptions and underlying data on which they have relied in reaching their opinions are revealed, the bases for their differences may become clearer and substantial simplification of the issues may be possible. In addition, disclosure can facilitate rulings well in advance of trial on objections to the qualifications of an expert, the relevance and reliability of opinions to be offered, or the reason - ableness of reliance on particular data. 240 Courts use various procedures to identify and narrow the grounds for disagreement between opposing experts; the 235 .

Such experts are not covered by Rule 26(a)(2), and may be deposed only upon a showing of “exceptional circumstances under which it is impractical . . . to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.” 241 If such a deposition is allowed, the court should consider imposing time limits and must require the party seeking discovery to pay an appropriate share of the cost reasonably incurred in obtaining facts and opinions from the ex - pert. 242 The stringent disclosure requirements applicable to testifying experts may lead parties to rely on consulting experts, deferring a decision whether to desig - nate them as trial experts. This matter should be addressed at the initial confer - ence and a cutoff date established for designation of trial experts and compliance with disclosure requirements. Court-appointed experts. 243 Although Rule 706 provides that an expert ap - pointed by the court may be deposed, the court should establish the terms on which an expert serves and the nature of the functions the expert is to perform.

Grand jury proceedings are presumptively secret, but the court may order disclosure upon a showing of a particularized need. 248 Disclosure may be ordered of testimony given before the grand jury and of documents subpoenaed or otherwise obtained for its use, 249 but a person may invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions about such testimony even if it was given un der a grant of immunity. 250 The production to a grand jury of otherwise discov erable material does not, however, entitle it to Rule 6 protection. 251 Copies made by a person of material produced to a grand jury are subject to discovery. Requests for disclosure of grand jury materials are generally addressed to the court that supervised the grand jury proceedings. 252 Nevertheless, because that court may not be able to assess the “particularized need” for the materials in the litigation for which they are sought, it should consult with the judge assigned to that litigation. 253 If disclosure is ordered, the court may include in the order protective limitations on the use of the material. 254 246 .

When summaries are so used, opposing parties must be given an adequate opportunity to examine the underlying data in advance of trial and raise objections in time to enable the pro - ponent of the summary to make necessary corrections.

In the case of the former, the reliability and validity of estimates about the population derived from sampling are critical. The methods used must conform to generally recognized statistical standards. Relevant factors include whether: • the population was properly chosen and defined; • the sample chosen was representative of that population; • the data gathered were accurately reported; and • the data were analyzed in accordance with accepted statistical principles. Laying the foundation for such evidence will ordinarily involve expert testimony and, along with disclosure of the underlying data and documentation, should be taken up by the court well in advance of trial. Even if the court finds deficiencies in the proponent’s showing, the court may receive the evidence subject to argu - ment going to its weight and probative value. 259 Sampling for the purpose of establishing the characteristics of a population must be distinguished from sampling (e.g., opinion polls or surveys) for the pur - pose of questioning individuals about such matters as their observations, actions, attitudes, beliefs, or motivations. Such sampling is not intended to establish the truth of an objective fact, but rather to provide evidence of public perceptions. The four factors listed above are relevant to assessing the admissibility of a survey, but need to be applied in light of the particular purpose for which the survey is offered. In addition, assessment of the validity of a survey should take into ac - count whether: • the questions asked were clear and not leading; • the survey was conducted by qualified persons following proper interview procedures; and • the process was conducted so as to ensure objectivity (e.g., was the survey conducted in anticipation of litigation and by persons connected with the parties or counsel or aware of its purpose in the litigation?).

The procedures for obtaining evidence from other countries are prescribed by (1) the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Rule 28(b) (depositions in a foreign coun try); 263 (2) statutes, particularly 28 U.S.C. § 1781 (transmittal of letter rogatory or request), § 1783 (subpoena of person in a foreign country), and § 1784 (contempt); and (3) international agreements, particularly the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial 260 . See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), 803(3). 261 . See Fed. R. Evid. 703. 262 . In civil law jurisdictions in which the gathering and presentation of evidence is under the control of the courts and not the litigants, taking a deposition may be considered the perfor mance of a judicial act by another sovereign. In addition, many common law jurisdictions disfavor discovery requests directed at obtaining material other than evidence to be presented at trial. See, e.g., Rio Tinto Zinc Corp. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., [1978] 1 All E.R. 434 (H.L. 1977); Extraterritorial Discovery in International Litigation 24 (PLI 1984). 263 . See also Fed. R. Civ.

The extent and form of pretrial discovery that will be compelled or even permitted by other sovereigns vary widely. Even within a particular country, the rules may differ de - pending on the nature and identity of the person or body from which the discovery is sought and on the type of information sought. For example, the breadth of discovery may depend on whether the evidence is testi - monial or documentary. 267 Some countries not only refuse to compel a witness to provide evidence, but also prohibit the voluntary production in any manner of some items of evidence. The attitude of the other country may also be affected by the current state of its diplomatic rela - tions with the United States and by the nature of the litigation. This latter factor is particularly important if the American litigation involves claims (such as antitrust) that conflict with the law or policies of the foreign country. • Position of the person or body from which discovery is sought . Foreign discovery rules may vary depending on whether discovery is sought from (1) a national of the United States, of the country in which the discovery is to be conducted, or of another country; (2) a person or entity party to the American litigation or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the American courts; 268 (3) an instrumentality or arm of a foreign country; or (4) a person or entity willing to provide the information. • Posture of the litigant. Extraterritorial discovery will be expedited if the parties to the litigation cooperate by entering into stipulations under Fed. 264 .

For example, most countries party to the Hague Convention will not execute letters of request for the purpose of obtaining pretrial disclosure of documents. See Hague Convention, art. 23, supra note 264. 268 . Where the entity or person from whom discovery is sought is subject to the court’s ju - risdiction, it will often be faster and less costly to utilize the standard discovery methods of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Obtaining Discovery Abroad 2 (ABA 1990). In considering whether to use the Federal Rules or the Hague Convention, the court should consider the particular facts of the case, the sovereign interests of the two countries, and the likelihood that resort to the procedures of the Hague Convention will be effective.

P. 29 as to the manner and location of discovery. 269 The refusal of a party with foreign connections or interests to enter into stipulations may not, however, reflect an uncooperative attitude but may be com - pelled by the laws or customs of the foreign country. Because procedures for obtaining foreign discovery vary from country to country and are often complex, it is generally advisable for the attorneys to asso - ciate local counsel. The Department of State and the appropriate American Embassy or Consulate can also provide assistance in planning discovery in foreign countries. 270 The Department of State’s Office of Citizens Consular Services can provide lists of local counsel and current information regarding such matters as reservations and declarations under the Hague Convention, practices in nonsignatory countries, the procedures to be followed in particular countries, and actual results of discovery efforts in specific countries. 271 Depositions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 28(b) establishes four alternate procedures for taking depositions in other countries. 272 Under Rule 28(b)(1), when the coun try where discovery is sought is a signatory to the Hague Convention, 273 depo sitions may be taken in accordance with the convention, as described below, though resort to the convention is not mandatory. 274 When the country is not a signatory, resort must be had to one of the procedures in Rule 28(b)(2)–(4). Under Rule 28(b)(2), the American court may issue a “letter of request” 275 seeking the voluntary assistance of the court or other agency of the foreign country to compel 269 . Stipulations for nonstenographic and telephonic depositions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(2), (7) also may be valuable (the court may also order the use of these procedures, see supra § 21.452), but such procedures may violate foreign law. Stipulations as to admissibility are particu larly important because the discovery may not be in the question-and-answer form traditional in American litigation. In this regard, the court should note that under Rule 28(b), “[e]vidence ob - tained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States under these rules.” For dis - cussion of this issue in a criminal case, see United States v. Salim, 855 F.2d 944 (2d Cir. 1988). 270 . For the State Department’s regulations on foreign discovery, see 22 C.F.R. § 92 (1993). 271 .

Under the “commission” method, the American court ap points a person—typically an American consular officer 279 —to administer the oath and preside over the deposition. Much foreign discovery will occur in countries that are signatories to the Hague Convention. 280 The convention generally allows evidence to be taken compulsorily pursuant to a letter of request 281 or voluntarily before a diplo matic officer or consular agent or any person “commissioned” for the pur pose. 282 The convention must, however, be read in light of the numerous reser vations and declarations made by the signatories, through which they have modified or 276 .

For the form and substance of a letter of request, see the Model for Letters of Request located after 28 U.S.C.A. § 1781 at 141–43 (West Supp. 1993). There may be a long delay, perhaps as much as two years, between the issuance of a letter of request and receipt of the evidence. The Department of State’s Office of Citizens Consular Services often can provide information about recent experiences in particular countries. 277 . Many countries not parties to the Convention, such as Switzerland and Canada, routinely execute letters of request from United States courts. 278 . For example, in Japan and Turkey a deposition on notice is permissible only of an American citizen, while Swiss law makes it a crime to take any deposition in that country without governmental authorization. 279 . See 22 C.F.R. § 92.4(a). 280 . Currently, twenty-one countries are signatories; for a list, see 28 U.S.C.A. § 1781 at 125–26 (West Supp. 1993). Ireland is the twenty-first and most recent signatory.

Under the convention, letters of request must be sent to a “Central Authority” designated by the receiving country; the identities of the authorities designated are given in notifications appended to the treaty.

When “necessary in the interest of justice,” a United States national or resi - dent in a foreign country may be subpoenaed to testify or produce docu ments. 284 Failure to comply may subject the person to punishment for con tempt. 285 Blocking laws. Efforts to obtain or compel production of documents located outside the United States may be impeded by one of the increasing number of foreign nondisclosure (or “blocking”) laws. 286 These laws take the form of gen eral commercial and bank secrecy laws, as well as more specific and discretionary blocking statutes aimed at combating perceived excesses in American discovery. 287 The fact that certain discovery is prohibited under foreign law, however, does not prevent the court from requiring a party to comply with a demand for it, 288 though it may be relevant in determining the sanctions to be imposed for noncompliance. 289 Where a party fails to comply with a discovery order be cause of a blocking statute, the court may impose any of the sanctions set out in Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b), though it may also consider factors such as the party’s good faith efforts to comply in declining to do so. 290 Judicial control. The Supreme Court has cautioned that United States courts should exercise special vigilance to protect foreign litigants from unnecessary or unduly burdensome discovery and should supervise pretrial proceedings particu - larly closely to prevent discovery abuses. 291 The additional cost may increase the danger that foreign discovery will be used for an improper purpose, such as to burden or harass; objections to abusive discovery advanced by foreign litigants should therefore receive “the most careful consideration.” 292 In deciding whether to issue an order directing production of information abroad, and in framing such an order, the court should consider the following: • the importance to the litigation of the discovery requested; • the degree of specificity of the request; 283 . Many countries, for example, require that a judicial officer conduct depositions, and a majority will not execute letters of request issued for the purpose of obtaining documents related solely to pretrial discovery. Each country’s declarations and reservations are listed in the notifications at the end of the convention.

The risk that a foreign country will refuse to execute a letter of request can be minimized by careful drafting. In most cases the request should be directed at evidence for use at trial. Requests for documents should be as specific as possible; Hague Convention countries that have executed a reservation under Article 23 295 will ordinarily not execute general requests for broad categories of docu ments for use in discovery. 296 The language of the letter should be simple and nontechnical, and no unnecessary information should be included. 297 The court should incorporate findings as to the extent of discovery to be permitted and the need therefor in a separate order that can be presented to foreign author ities, even if letters of request are not being issued. Federal judges are not authorized to travel abroad to control the conduct of depositions, at least in the absence of specific approval by the Judicial Conference of the United States. 298 For this reason, the court should adopt in advance ap - propriate guidelines to govern such depositions consistent with the laws of the other country. 299 Moreover, if permissible under the laws and customs of that country, the judge may be available by telephone to resolve disputes or may ap - point a special master to supervise the deposition personally. 300 Before either of these procedures are employed, advice should be sought from the Department of State’s Office of Citizens Consular Services. 293 .

Referrals to a neutral may at times be helpful, either by relieving the judge of time-consuming proceedings or by bringing to bear special expertise. The authority to make such referrals is, however, circumscribed and conditioned, and the resulting costs and benefits must be balanced. 21.51 Court-Appointed Experts As complex litigation increasingly involves issues calling for scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge, and judges and juries are confronted with con - tradictory opinions from opposing experts, interest in court-appointed experts has grown. Such experts may serve a number of purposes: to advise the court on technical issues, to provide the jury with background information to aid compre - hension, or to offer a neutral opinion on disputed technical issues. 302 The court has broad discretion to appoint such an expert, sua sponte or on request of the parties, but should consider the problems and implications of making an ap - pointment; it is advisable to consider whether there are adequate alternatives to such an appointment, such as directing the experts to clarify, simplify, and nar - row the differences between them. 303 These problems include: • Cost. Because the parties have to bear the expense, court appointment of an expert increases the already high cost of complex litigation. 304 301 . This section of the manual is primarily concerned with referrals of factual disputes that will be subject to proof at trial. Use of special masters and magistrate judges to exercise judicial su - pervision over all or specified portions of the pretrial proceedings or to perform administrative functions is discussed in other sections.

Truly neutral experts are difficult, if not impos - sible, to find; though they will have no commitment to any party, they do not come to the case free of experience and opinions that will predispose (even if only subconsciously), or may be perceived to predispose, them in some fashion on disputed issues relevant to the case. • Neutrality of the court. Testimony from a court-appointed expert may be seen as the court taking sides. 305 • Delay. The testimony of a court-appointed expert may lengthen the trial, although there may be offsetting savings by the narrowing of issues, re - ducing of the scope of the controversy, and perhaps promoting settle - ment. • Timing of the appointment. The need for an appointment will not always be clear early in the litigation; by the time it becomes clear, the case may be at or about to go to trial, and introduction of a court-appointed expert at that point would cause delay. Nevertheless, in appropriate cases, appointment of a neutral expert can be beneficial: • Court-appointed experts can have “a great tranquilizing effect” on the parties’ experts, reducing adversariness and potentially clarifying and narrowing disputed issues. 306 • They may facilitate settlement or at least stipulations. • They can help the court and jury comprehend the issues and the evi - dence. If an appointment is made, the order should clearly specify the duties, func - tions, compensation, and authority of the expert. 307 A court-appointed expert is not limited when forming opinions to information presented by the parties at a hearing, and, at least if the expert is to serve as a witness, is subject to discovery with respect to his or her opinions; the order should specify the ground rules for depositions and other discovery directed at the expert, including the extent to which materials used or considered by the expert will be subject to discovery. The order should specify whether the expert is to provide a written report to the par - pelling circumstances when the indigent party’s claim has merit. See McKinney v. Anderson, 924 F.2d 1500, 1510–11 (9th Cir. 1991); United States Marshals Service v. Means, 741 F.2d 1053, 1057– 59 (8th Cir. 1984) (en banc); Cecil & Willging, supra note 302, at 62–65.

The order may also state how the jury should be instructed; generally it would be told that the opinions of a court-appointed expert should be treated the same as those of other expert witnesses—the opinions are entitled to only such weight as is warranted by the witness’s knowledge, expertise, and prepara - tion. If the expert serves only as a technical advisor to the judge, 308 ex parte communications may be necessary but may be subjected to procedural safe - guards. Such safeguards might include (1) giving the parties notice of the expert’s identity and precise function; (2) providing written instructions detailing the ex - pert’s duties; and (3) requiring the expert to submit a written report or otherwise advising the parties of the substance of the advice given. 309 In selecting an expert witness for appointment, the court should seek a per son whose fairness and expertise in the field cannot reasonably be questioned and who can communicate effectively as a witness. Although the appointment is made by the court, every effort should be made to select a person acceptable to the liti - gants; the parties should first be asked to submit a list of proposed experts and may be able, with the assistance of their own experts, to agree on one or more candidates. The court may also call on professional organizations and academic groups to provide a list of qualified and available persons (though not delegating the selection to any such organization), giving the parties an opportunity to comment. In making appointments, judges must avoid even the appearance of patronage or favoritism. 310 21.52 Special Masters Fed. R. Civ.

The court may appoint an expert to render assistance other than testifying at trial, such as analysis and evaluation of the reports prepared by the parties’ experts or attorneys.

The clerk and deputy clerks of court may not be appointed as special masters “unless there are special reasons requiring such appointment which are recited in the or - der of appointment.” 321 Special masters have increasingly been appointed for their expertise in par - ticular fields, such as accounting and finance or the science or technology in - volved in the litigation. 322 Hence the distinction between special masters under Rule 53 and court-appointed experts under Fed. R. Evid. 706 has become blurred. The court may make an appointment under the latter rule without the restric tions imposed under Rule 53. Although Rule 706 by its terms speaks of a “witness,” it also specifically permits the appointed expert to make “findings.” Thus, when the court is calling on a neutral for that person’s “scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge,” as contemplated by Rule 702, it may consider making the appointment under Rule 706 even though no testimony is contem plated. Presumptively, however, a person appointed under Rule 706 would be subject to discovery; Rule 53 makes no provision for discovery of special masters but the parties have access to the special master’s report. 323 An order of reference to a special master should define with specificity the scope of the reference, the issues to be investigated, the time when the report is to be delivered, and the special master’s powers. 324 Subject to the terms of that or der, a special master may require production of tangible evidence, examine wit nesses under oath, 325 and “do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper” to 321 . 28 U.S.C. § 957. 322 .

When appointed to resolve disputed issues, the special master must produce a report on the matters submitted by the order of reference, including in it any findings of fact or conclusions of law. 328 In nonjury actions, the court may ac cept the findings of fact unless “clearly erroneous.” The findings are also admis sible in jury trials, 329 but the court should be mindful that they may carry un due weight with the jury. The parties may stipulate that the special master’s findings of fact are to be accepted as final, leaving only questions of law for re view. 330 21.53 Magistrate Judges Under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) 331 Referrals, apart from referrals of supervision of pretrial proceedings as discussed at supra section 20.14, may also be made to magistrate judges, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(f), 72, and local rules. 332 Like a special master, a magistrate judge acting under these provisions makes factual determi - nations based on evidence presented at an adversarial hearing and submits a dis - position or recommendation for a disposition, along with proposed findings of fact when appropriate, by written report filed with the court and served on the parties. 333 The parties have no right to engage in discovery from, or to cross - examine, the magistrate judge. Under Rule 72, the magistrate judge’s ruling on nondispositive matters may, if objected to within ten days of service, be modified or set aside only if “clearly erroneous or contrary to law.” 334 On matters dis - positive of a claim or defense, the magistrate judge’s recommended disposition is, on timely, specific, written objection by a party, 335 subject to de novo determi - nation by the judge, who may, but need not, take further evidence. 336 This dis - 326 .

Unless specifically authorized by statute or agreed to by the parties, however, the court should be cautious in experimenting with such procedures in cases in which, if the judge is held to be in error, a lengthy and costly retrial might be re - quired.

Its pur poses explicated in Rule 16(a), to “improv[e] the quality of the trial through more thorough preparation” and to “facilitat[e] the settlement of the case,” take on special importance in complex litigation. Thus the provisions of Rule 16(d) should be observed, requiring that: • the final pretrial conference be held as close to the time of trial as is rea - sonable under the circumstances; • the parties formulate a plan for trial, including a program for facilitating the admission of evidence; and • the conference be attended by the attorneys who will conduct the trial. The court should issue an order setting the conference and specifying the items to be taken up. To maximize the utility of the conference, summary judg - ment motions and (to the extent feasible) motions in limine should be decided well in advance (see supra section 21.34, summary judgment). Preparation for the final pretrial conference, rather than generating massive unnecessary paper work, should be tailored to accomplish the purposes of Rule 16. Essential agenda items include exchange and submission of the following: 342 • a final list identifying the witnesses to be called and the subject of their testimony, including a designation of deposition excerpts to be read; 342 .

The trial date needs to take into account the commitments of the court and counsel and should permit an uninterrupted trial. Counsel should be advised in advance that once the date is set, the court will not grant continuances; the court may set a deadline after which it will not permit partial settlements that might necessitate a continuance of the trial (see infra section 23.21). Where litigation includes cases originally filed in other districts and trans - ferred to the court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings under 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the court needs to consider whether those cases should be referred to the multidistrict panel for remand to the districts from which they were trans - ferred 345 or whether consolidation with the cases pending in the district is fea - sible, depending on whether the cases transferred for pretrial are eligible for a change of venue to the district, permitting them to be tried there. 346 Venue motions may have been deferred, but should now be promptly decided. In refer - ring cases back to the panel, the judge may indicate the nature and expected du - ration of remaining discovery, the estimated time before the case will be ready for trial, and the major rulings that, if not revised, will affect further proceedings, and may make appropriate recommendations for further proceedings. In most cases transferred under 28 U.S.C. § 1407, substantially all discovery will be completed before remand. In some cases, however, such as mass tort litigation, discovery re - 343 . See Fed. R.

For a fuller discussion of remand, see infra section 31.133. 21.62 Reevaluation of Jury Demands Although a general demand for a jury trial may have been made early in the liti - gation, 347 the court may, at the final pretrial conference, consider whether the parties are entitled to a jury trial on particular issues and, if not, whether those is - sues should be decided by the court in a separate trial (which may be concurrent with the jury trial), by motion, 348 or submitted to an advisory jury. 349 If both jury and nonjury issues are to be tried, the court should determine whether Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover 350 requires that the jury issues be decided first. Even if so, the judge may hear evidence during the jury trial on related nonjury is sues, later affording the parties the opportunity to supplement the record with evidence relevant only to the nonjury issues and deferring a decision on the non - jury issues until after the verdict has been returned. In mass tort cases, the court may ask the parties to consider whether to try liability and lump sum damage is - sues to the jury, leaving the resolution of individual damage claims to special agreed procedures (see infra section 33.28, mass tort litigation, trial). 21.63 Structure of Trial .631 Consolidation 119 .632 Separate Trials 119 .633 Special Verdicts and Interrogatories 120 Because complex cases often involve numerous parties and issues, a fair and efficient trial structure is needed. Suggestions should be sought from counsel for approaches to structuring that will improve the trial process. They may include, in addition to the devices discussed in the following paragraphs, the trial of one or more test cases, with appropriate provision being made concerning the estop - pel effect of a judgment. The interplay of these various devices can have a significant effect on the fair and efficient resolution of complex litigation. 351 Consideration of any of these devices must take into account their potentially disparate impact on the parties, given their respective trial burdens and possibly unequal resources, their effect on the right to trial by jury, the possibilities of set - tlement, and the interests of the court and the public. 347 .

R. Civ. P. 42(a) for trial or pretrial if it will avoid unnecessary cost or delay. Consolidation may be for trial of the entire case or of only separable common issues. It may be appropriate even if some issues or cases are to be tried before a jury and others before the court; the same evidence needs to be presented only once even though the judge may consider it in some of the cases and the jury in others. Class actions may be consolidated with cases brought by opt-outs or other individual plaintiffs. Care should be taken in such situations to ensure that counsel for parties in the nonclass actions are given a fair oppor - tunity to participate in the presentation of evidence and arguments at trial, par - ticularly when their clients are primarily affected. Whether consolidation is permissible or desirable will depend in large part on the extent to which the evidence in the cases is common. Unless common evi - dence predominates, consolidated trials may lead to jury confusion while failing to improve efficiency. To avoid this problem, the court may sever for a joint trial those issues on which common evidence predominates, reserving noncommon issues for subsequent individual trials. For example, in mass tort litigation, liabil - ity issues may be consolidated for joint trial, reserving damage issues for later in - dividual trials. If most of the proof will be common but some evidence admissible in one case should not be heard in others, a multiple-jury format may be consid - ered. Cases in which major conflicts exist between the basic trial positions of par - ties should not be consolidated, at least without ensuring that no prejudice re - sults. Consolidation is also inappropriate where its principal effect will be unnec - essarily to magnify the dimensions of the litigation. 353 In massive litigation, innovative procedures have been used to bring about the resolution of large numbers of cases in a consolidated trial without a separate trial of each individual case. 354 Such procedures should be designed so as to protect the essentials of the parties’ right to jury trial. 21.632 Separate Trials Whether the litigation involves a single case or many cases, severance of certain issues for separate trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) can be advantageous. Severance can reduce the length of trial, particularly if the severed issue is dis - positive of the case, and can also improve comprehension of the issues and evi - dence.

Under Beacon Theatres , the right to trial by jury on legal claims may not (except under “the most imperative cir - cumstances”) be lost by a prior determination of equitable claims; this may re - quire trial of legal claims before the court decides related claims in equity, or that they be tried concurrently. 356 In addition, issues should not be severed for trial if they are so intertwined that they cannot fairly be adjudicated in isolation, 357 or when severance would create a risk of inconsistent adjudication. Generally when issues are severed for separate trials, they should be tried be - fore the same jury unless they are entirely unrelated. Severance may take the form of having evidence on discrete issues presented sequentially, with the jury return - ing a verdict on an issue before the trial moves on to the next issue (see infra sec - tion 22.34). 21.633 Special Verdicts and Interrogatories Special verdicts or interrogatories accompanying a general verdict may help the jury focus on the issues, reduce the length and complexity of the instructions, and minimize the need for, or scope of, retrial in the event of reversible error. 358 They can provide guidance in conducting discovery, ruling on nonjury issues (possibly with some issues presented to the jury while others are reserved for de cision by the court) or motions for summary judgment, 359 trying remaining is sues, or negotiating settlement. Having counsel draft (and submit at the pretrial conference) proposed verdict forms along with jury instructions will help focus counsel’s attention on the specific issues in dispute and inform the court. Special verdicts and interrogatories should be drafted so as to help the jury understand and decide the issues while minimizing the risk of inconsistent ver - dicts. The questions should be arranged on the form in a logical and comprehen - sible manner; for example, questions common to several causes of action or de - 355 .

Where the legal standards applicable to similar claims or defenses differ (for example, where different law may apply to different parties), careful drafting of questions on a special verdict form can ease problems that consolidation could otherwise cause. Issues not in dispute should be excluded from the verdict form. Special verdicts may also be used in connection with a procedure by which is - sues are submitted to the jury sequentially. The jury may be asked to consider a threshold or dispositive issue and return its verdict before submission of other is - sues, which may be rendered moot by the verdict. Some judges and attorneys are reluctant to use these devices out of fear of in - consistent verdicts and jury confusion. These problems can be avoided by careful draftsmanship. Parties’ views on the desirability of special verdicts or interroga - tories will differ, however, if they are seen as more advantageous to one side than the other; the court will have to evaluate the arguments for and against them in the particular case. The court may also wish to suggest that the parties stipulate to accept a ma - jority verdict if the jury is not unanimous 360 or to waive a verdict and accept a decision by the judge based on the trial evidence. Although such stipulations may be obtained after the case has gone to trial, the parties may be more amenable be - fore trial begins. 21.64 Procedures to Expedite Presentation of Evidence .641 Statements of Facts and Evidence 122 .642 Pretrial Rulings on Objections 122 .643 Limits on Evidence 124 The principal purpose of the final pretrial conference is the “formulat[ion of] a plan for trial, including a program for facilitating the admission of evidence.” 361 The plan should eliminate, to the extent possible, irrelevant, immaterial, cumula - tive, and redundant evidence, and further the clear and efficient presentation of evidence. Essential to the accomplishment of this purpose is a final definition of the issues to be tried, after elimination of undisputed and peripheral matters. The process begun at the initial conference of defining and narrowing issues, dis - cussed in supra section 21.3, should reach completion at the final pretrial confer - ence. Attention may then be directed to the proof the parties expect to offer at trial. Review of that proof should be accompanied by consideration of fair, effec - tive, and perhaps innovative ways of presenting it. This may include, in addition 360 . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 48. 361 . Fed.

Other techniques to expedite the presentation of evi - dence are discussed in infra section 22.3. 21.641 Statements of Facts and Evidence One of the methods sometimes used to ensure adequate preparation, streamline the evidence, and prevent unfair surprise is statements of facts and evidence, or contentions and proof. Each party prepares and submits a statement listing the facts it intends to establish at trial and the supporting evidence. The statement should be sufficiently detailed to be informative and complete, but free of argu - ment and conclusions. No evidence not included in the statement would be permitted at trial. The exchange of such statements may be useful in narrowing factual disputes and expediting the trial (see also supra section 21.47). The sub - stantial amount of work required for their preparation, however, may outweigh the benefits, and such statements should not be required routinely without prior consideration. 21.642 Pretrial Rulings on Objections Objections to evidence should be resolved and technical defects (such as lack of foundation) cured before trial whenever possible. Where the admissibility of evi - dence turns on other facts, the facts should be established where possible before trial, by stipulation if there is no basis for serious dispute (see supra section 21.445). Parties should therefore be required, to the extent feasible, to raise their objections to admissibility in advance of trial (usually by motions in limine ), 362 with all other objections, except those based on relevance or prejudice, deemed waived. Pretrial rulings on admissibility save time at trial and may enable parties to overcome technical objections by eliminating inadmissible material, obtaining alternative sources of proof, or presenting necessary foundation evidence. In addition, they may narrow the issues and enable counsel to plan more effectively for trial. Time may also be saved by receiving exhibits into the record at pretrial, avoiding the need for formal offers at trial. Objections to documentary evidence may be indicated in a response to the pretrial listing of such evidence by opposing counsel. Objections to deposition 362 . Objections (other than under Fed. R. Evid. 402 or 403) to the admissibility of proposed exhibits disclosed as required by Rule 26(a)(3)(C) or the use of depositions designated as required by Rule 26(a)(3)(B) may be deemed waived unless made within fourteen days of disclosure.

Objections to other types of evidence may be made by means of a separate mo - tion or other written request, describing the nature of the proposed evidence and the grounds of the objection. The court should try to rule on objections without argument, but may call for written or oral argument or even a pretrial evidentiary hearing under Fed. R. Evid. 104. In such a hearing the court is not bound by the rules of evidence, ex - cept those respecting privileges. 363 Evidentiary rulings that cannot be made with confidence except in the light of developments at trial may be made on a tentative basis, subject to later revision, rather than be entirely deferred for consideration at trial. The benefits of advance rulings on objections should be weighed against the potential for wasteful pretrial efforts by the court and counsel. For example, rul - ing on objections within a deposition may require the judge to read it before trial, despite the fact that the deposition or the objections to it may be partially or en - tirely mooted or withdrawn because of developments during trial. The court may therefore prefer to make pretrial rulings only on those objections that are consid - ered sufficiently important by counsel to merit an advance ruling, either because of their significance to the outcome of the case or because of their effect on the scope or form of other evidence. Pretrial rulings on evidence may be particularly important with respect to often expensive and elaborate demonstrative evidence, such as computer simula - tions (see infra section 34.32). It may be advisable to obtain at least a preliminary ruling or guidance concerning the admissibility of a proposed exhibit before sub - stantial expense is incurred in its preparation (e.g., at the storyboard stage of a computer animation). Computer-generated animations or simulations raise a number of issues that should be addressed at pretrial, including the treatment of any narration (possibly including hearsay statements), the need for limiting instructions (such as to clar - ify the specific purpose for which the evidence is offered), the authenticity and reliability of the underlying data, and the assumptions on which the exhibit is based. Opposing parties and the court should be given an early opportunity to view the evidence so that objections may be raised and ruled on in advance of trial. 364 Pretrial rulings are also advisable with respect to proffered expert testimony that may be pivotal. The court may rule on the basis of written submissions, but 363 . Fed. R. Evid. 104(a). 364 .

Others prefer to leave no stone unturned, resulting in trials of exces - sive length unless limited by the judge. Where the parties’ pretrial estimates sug - gest that trial will be excessively long, the judge should first discuss the possibility of voluntary, self-imposed limits with the lawyers, perhaps suggesting exhibits or testimony that could be eliminated and inviting further suggestions. If this approach is not productive, the judge should consider imposing limits in some form, using the authority under Rule 16(c)(4) and Fed. R. Evid. 403 and 611. The mere announcement of the court’s intention to impose such limits may suffice to motivate counsel to exercise the discipline necessary to expedite the case. Before imposing limits, the court, based on the pretrial submissions and consultation with counsel, should be sufficiently familiar with the litigation to form a reasonable judgment about the time necessary for trial and the scope of the necessary evidence. Limits may be imposed in a variety of ways: • on the number of witnesses or exhibits to be offered on a particular issue or in the aggregate; • on the length of examination and cross-examination of particular wit - nesses; • on the total time to be allowed each side for all direct and cross-examina - tion; and • by narrowing issues, by order or stipulation. Judges who have imposed limits have found that they have not hampered the ability of counsel to present their case; indeed, they seem to have been welcomed by counsel. At the same time, limits must not be permitted to jeopardize the fairness of the trial. In designing limits, the respective evidentiary burdens of the parties need to be taken into account. Limits should generally be imposed before trial begins so that the parties can plan accordingly, but at times the need for lim - its may not become apparent until trial is underway. Limits must be firm so that one side cannot take advantage of the other; at the same time, however, the judge may have to extend the limits if good cause is shown. If a party requests, the jury may be advised of any limits imposed, in order to prevent unwarranted inferences from a party’s failure to call all possible witnesses. 365 .

To that end, the parties should submit and exchange pro - posed substantive jury instructions (both preliminary and final) before the con - ference; some judges require counsel to confer and submit a single set of those in - structions on which there is no disagreement. 366 This process compels counsel to analyze the elements of their claims and defenses and the supporting and op - posing evidence. Working with the parties’ submissions, many judges then pre - pare their own substantive instructions and have found that they are generally ac - cepted by counsel with little argument. Proposed instructions can be submitted on disks in compatible word processing programs to enable the judge to make revisions on chambers computers. Many judges provide their own standard in - structions to counsel for comment. 21.66 Briefs and Final Pretrial Motions If legal issues remain to be resolved, briefs should be submitted in advance of the final pretrial conference. Early submission will assist the court and counsel in preparing for the conference and make it more productive. With discovery complete and critical evidentiary rulings made, some addi - tional issues may be ready for summary judgment. Motions for summary judg - ment should be presented and decided no later than the final conference, absent special circumstances. Deferring such motions and their resolution to the eve of trial may cause unnecessary expense and inconvenience to counsel, witnesses, ju - rors, and the court, and may interfere with planning for the conduct of the trial. 21.67 Final Pretrial Order 367 At the conclusion of the final pretrial conference, an order should be entered reciting all actions taken and rulings made, whether at the conference or earlier. The order should provide that it will govern the conduct of the trial and will not be modified except “to prevent manifest injustice.” 368 The order should, among other things, state: • the starting date of the trial and the schedule to be followed; • the issues to be tried; • if separate trials are to be held, the issues to be tried at the initial trial; • the witnesses to be called and the exhibits to be offered by each side (other than for impeachment); 366 .

Management is needed to reduce complex - ity, cost, and trial time, and improve the quality of the trial. Its effectiveness de - pends on the design and implementation of flexible and creative plans that take into account the specific needs of particular litigation and permit the attorneys to try their case in an orderly fashion. While judicial management is equally important in civil and criminal litiga - tion, the two frequently pose different problems and considerations. This section deals primarily with civil trials; criminal trials are discussed in infra section 32.3. As noted below, however, some principles of civil trial management may be rele - vant to criminal trials as well. 22.1 Administration .11 Trial Schedule 128 .12 Courthouse Facilities 129 .13 Managing Exhibits 130 .14 Transcripts 131 .15 Conferences During Trial 132 22.11 Trial Schedule A trial schedule is essential to the orderly conduct of a trial. The schedule may, but need not, limit the length of the trial itself or the time allotted to each side for examination and cross-examination of witnesses (see infra section 22.35). Whether or not it imposes time limits, the schedule should specify the days of the week and the hours each day that the trial will be held, and the holidays and other days when the trial will be in recess (such as for a weekly motions day). The trial schedule should be set only after consultation with counsel and, to be realistic, must take into account the court’s, counsel’s, and parties’ other commitments. Once appropriate accommodations have been made for other demands on the time of the participants, the schedule should ordinarily be regarded as a com - mitment by all, to be modified only in cases of extreme urgency. An exception may be made in very lengthy trials, which may require review of the schedule from time to time. Adherence to the schedule requires that all trial participants make appropri - ate arrangements for their other activities. The jurors should be informed of the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Trial 129 schedule at the time of voir dire and, if unable to commit to it, should be excused if possible. They should be kept informed of any changes in the schedule during the trial and advised of the progress of the trial in order to make their own ar - rangements. Unforeseen events may, of course, arise during a trial affecting a ju - ror’s availability. Ordinarily, the court will need to accept minor delays in order not to lose a juror who may later be needed to enable the jury to return a verdict. The judge should insist that all trial participants be punctual and prepared to proceed on schedule. To minimize interruptions while allowing the attorneys to function effectively, the court may permit attorneys to enter and leave the court - room discretely during the proceedings. The jury should be informed of this, to avoid any perception of discourtesy. To expedite the trial and avoid keeping the jury waiting, the trial day should be devoted to the uninterrupted presentation of evidence. Objections, motions, and other matters that may interrupt should as much as possible be raised at a time set aside for the purpose, before the jury arrives in the morning or after it leaves in the afternoon. Any matter that must be raised during the presentation of evidence should be stated briefly without argument and ruled on promptly. If an objection is too complex for an immediate ruling, the judge should consider de - ferring it until it can be resolved without taking the jury’s time and proceeding with the presentation of evidence, possibly directing counsel to pursue a different line of questioning for the moment. In managing the trial, the court should not hesitate to use its authority under Fed. R. Evid. 611(a) to “exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evi - dence.” Judges employ different approaches to the scheduling of trial: • Six-day week. Some feel that an extended trial week is the best way to ex - pedite a lengthy trial. Others believe that such a schedule takes too great a toll on trial participants and leaves insufficient time for other activities. • Four-and-a-half-day week. With this commonly used schedule, one half day each week is reserved for administrative matters, hearings outside the presence of the jury, and matters other than the trial. • Morning schedule. Holding trial in the morning only (for example, from 9 a.m . to noon for a short day, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. for a long day) per - mits jurors to continue working during the trial (which can in turn re - duce requests to be excused) and allows the court and counsel substantial time to keep up with other work. 22.12 Courthouse Facilities When a trial is expected to involve a large numbers of attorneys, parties, and wit - nesses, and numerous exhibits and documents, advance planning for appropriate accommodations is advisable. It may be necessary to make arrangements for:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • a larger courtroom, in the courthouse or elsewhere; • physical modifications to the courtroom, such as additional space for counsel, parties, files, exhibits, or persons such as experts or consultants whose presence may be needed; • jury accommodations, particularly in a lengthy trial; • witness and attorney conference rooms; and • courtroom security and access during nontrial hours. These needs should be made known to those responsible for allocating space and maintaining the building as far in advance as possible. The parties should be allowed access before trial to the courtroom and other areas as necessary to pre - pare and to advise the court of potential problems. Advance preparation is par - ticularly important (and may require more time and effort than usual) if special equipment, such as computers, video playback equipment and monitors, systems to aid interpreters or court reporters, or additional telephone lines, will be in - stalled. 371 The judge should designate court personnel with whom the parties may coordinate these activities. 22.13 Managing Exhibits To avoid trial delay and interruption, each document or other item to be offered in evidence or used at trial (other than for impeachment) should be: • premarked with an identification number, preferably in advance of trial but at least one day before it is to be offered or referred to at trial (preferably a single identification designation should be used for pretrial discovery and trial (see supra section 21.441)); • listed on the form used by the court to record such evidence; counsel should obtain from the clerk’s office in advance of trial copies of the form used by the court, or, subject to the judge’s approval, create a form for use in the particular case; • made available to opposing counsel and the court before trial begins; • copied, enlarged, or imaged 372 as necessary for use at trial; and • redacted, if lengthy, to eliminate irrelevant matter. As discussed in supra section 21.64, the court should require pretrial disclo - sure of proposed exhibits and objections thereto, and make pretrial rulings on admissibility to the extent feasible. The trial may be expedited, and trial interrup - tions avoided, by use of the following procedures: 371 . The use of technology at trial is discussed in infra § 22.3; for more detailed descriptions of available technology, see infra § 34. 372 . Imaging of documents for computerized storage and retrieval is discussed in supra § 21.444."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Trial 131 • exhibits not objected to or to which pretrial objections were overruled may be admitted into evidence without formal offer and ruling; • pretrial rulings on objections to evidence should preclude renewal of the offer or objection at trial in the absence of a substantial basis for recon - sideration; 373 • objections made at trial should be ruled on from the bench without ar - gument; if the court wants to hear argument, it should be deferred to the next scheduled recess and counsel should proceed with other matters (see infra section 22.15); • alternatively, attorneys not needed in the courtroom may present objec - tions and arguments to a magistrate judge while the trial is proceeding — unresolved objections can later be presented to the judge if necessary, along with the magistrate judge’s summary of the arguments, for resolu - tion after the jury has been excused. 374 22.14 Transcripts Because expedited, daily, or hourly transcripts add substantially to the expense of the litigation, their cost must be balanced against their utility. Having access to the transcript in the course of trial aids counsel’s preparation for cross and redi - rect examination, helps resolve disputes over testimony during trial, facilitates rulings on evidence, and can speed preparation of the record on appeal. The de - cision whether to incur the extra costs of such transcripts should be left to coun - sel. 375 Having a transcript available can speed readbacks requested by the jury dur - ing deliberations, but the transcript should not ordinarily be given to the jury for fear that the text may overshadow the mental impression of witness demeanor and credibility. Jurors should be advised at the outset of the trial that they should expect to have to rely on their recollection and not assume that a transcript will be available to them. In courts with access to computer-aided transcription (CAT), transcription may be virtually in real time, accessible on computer screens as well as in hard 373 . Counsel should, however, consult local law to determine whether renewal of the objec tion is required to prevent waiver. See United States v. Rutkowski, 814 F.2d 594, 598 (11th Cir. 1987). 374 . See Harry M. Reasoner and Betty R. Owens, Innovative Judicial Techniques in Managing Complex Litigation , 19 Fed. Litig. Guide 603, 605–06 (1989) (discussing ETSI v. Burlington N., Inc., B-84-979-CA (E.D. Tex.)). 375 . Under 28 U.S.C. § 1920(2), the court may tax as costs “fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case.” Courts do not ordinarily include in taxable costs the additional fees for expedited or daily transcript. See 10 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2677 (2d ed. 1983) and cases cited therein."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"132 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third copy, and often at standard rates. 376 For further discussion of this technology, see infra section 34.38. 22.15 Conferences During Trial The court should schedule a conference with counsel for the end of each trial day after the jury has been excused. The conference may be brief, but should generally be on the record to avoid later misunderstandings. Holding such a conference helps avoid or at least minimize bench conferences and other interruption of the trial. It should be used to plan the next day’s proceedings and to fix the order of witnesses and exhibits, avoiding surprise and ensuring that the parties will not run out of witnesses. Counsel can raise anticipated problems with the court and the court may hear offers of proof and arguments. The court may, in light of other evidence previously presented, determine that further evidence on a point would be cumulative. In large litigation, attorneys working on the case but not di - rectly engaged in the courtroom can prepare motions for consideration at the conference. The judge can provide guidance to attorneys without the stigma of courtroom admonitions, remind them when necessary of appropriate standards of conduct, and cool antagonism generated in the heat of trial. A short conference before the jury arrives in the morning may also be useful, to deal with last-minute changes in the order of witnesses or exhibits or to follow up on matters raised at the previous day’s conference. 22.2 Conduct of Trial .21 Opening Statements 132 .22 Special Procedures for Multiparty Cases 133 .23 Advance Notice of Evidence and Order of Proof/Preclusion Orders 134 .24 The Judge’s Role 135 22.21 Opening Statements Opening statements, intended to help the jury understand the issues and the proof at trial, are of particular importance in complex litigation. To maximize their utility, the court should consider some of the following points: • opening statements should outline the facts expected to be proved, not argue the case—their effectiveness will be enhanced if they are preceded by preliminary instructions from the court outlining the principal issues to be decided; 376 . In Cimino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 751 F. Supp. 649 (E.D. Tex. 1990), CAT typically allowed production of transcripts of the morning’s testimony by 1:30 P . M . and the afternoon’s tes - timony by the evening of the same day. See generally, with respect to organizing trials, Robert M. Parker, Streamlining Complex Cases , 10 Rev. Litig. 547, 556 (1991)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Trial 133 • opening statements should be brief—the court may want to set a reason - able time limit; • ground rules should be set in advance for dealing with sensitive issues such as punitive damages and evidence that may yet be ruled inadmissi - ble; • in long trials, the court may allow time for each side to make supplemen - tary opening statements at appropriate points during trial to help the jury understand evidence as it is presented; • ground rules should be set for the use during opening statements of charts and other demonstrative aids not then in evidence—while the use of such aids at this stage can aid jury comprehension and should be en - couraged, opposing counsel should have an opportunity to review and object to them in advance of trial; • in multiparty cases, the court should consider whether it is necessary to permit each party to present an opening statement to establish its sepa - rate identity with the jury, and, if so, whether repetition can be mini - mized and time limited; and • in nonjury cases, opening statements may be briefer but are still useful in informing the court of each party’s contentions and proposed order of proof. 22.22 Special Procedures for Multiparty Cases The proliferation of counsel in multiparty cases can lead to delay and confusion. The court should therefore consider appropriate procedures, including the fol - lowing: • assigning primary responsibility for the conduct of trial to a limited number of attorneys, either by formal designation of trial counsel (see supra section 20.22) or by informal arrangement among the attorneys, taking into account legitimate needs for individual representation of par - ties; • in cases in which the court will be awarding or apportioning attorneys’ fees, overseeing the arrangements for trial preparation, including clarify - ing the extent to which attorneys in subsidiary roles will be entitled to compensation and ensuring that attorneys will not claim compensation for unnecessary time spent at trial (see infra section 24.213); • providing that objections made by one party will be deemed made by all similarly situated parties unless expressly disclaimed—other counsel should be permitted to add further grounds of objection, again on behalf of all similarly situated parties unless disclaimed;"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"134 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • to minimize repeated objections, ordering that objections to a particular line of examination will be deemed “continuing” until its completion, without the need for further objection unless new grounds arise as the examination proceeds; and • in cases where collusion or conspiracy is alleged, allowing counsel rea - sonable leeway to demonstrate their independence from one another, and, if requested, giving cautionary instructions. 22.23 Advance Notice of Evidence and Order of Proof/Preclusion Orders Counsel should be directed to exchange lists of expected witnesses and exhibits for each trial day (with copies if not previously supplied), indicating the order in which they will be called or offered. If portions of depositions are to be read, the portions should be identified. The court should specify the amount of advance notice required, balancing opposing counsel’s need for time to prepare against the possibility that intervening developments will require changes. Some courts require a tentative listing of the order of witnesses and exhibits a week or more in advance, with changes to be communicated as soon as known and a final list to be given at a conference held at the close of the preceding day. Counsel should (absent unusual circumstances) indicate in advance when adverse parties or their employees will be called to testify, and endeavor to ac - commodate personal and business conflicts as well as avoid surprise and possible embarrassment by calling on the opponent to produce a person without warning. If numerous employees are called, counsel should order them so as to avoid dis - rupting the adversary’s affairs unnecessarily. When plaintiffs call significant de - fense witnesses, defendants may be permitted to offer their case on redirect exam - ination. Counsel for the adverse party should be encouraged, upon sufficient ad - vance notice, to arrange for the presence of witnesses under its control at the agreed-upon time without the need for a subpoena (and even if not subject to subpoena). The court should ordinarily allow witnesses, whether or not subpoe - naed, to agree to report on timely request rather than remain in continuous at - tendance. A party may, however, be unwilling to make available employees who are be - yond the court’s subpoena power. 377 Though the court probably lacks authority to compel their appearance, it may encourage cooperation by precluding that party from later calling such witnesses itself. The court may similarly preclude witnesses who have earlier successfully resisted testifying for the opposing side on privilege or other grounds; an effective procedure is for the court to enter an or - 377 . In such a case, any party may offer that witness’s deposition for any purpose “unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3)(B)."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Trial 135 der requiring witnesses to elect between testifying or asserting a privilege at least forty-five days prior to trial. 22.24 The Judge’s Role 378 Although the lawyers are responsible for preparing and presenting the case, the judge must always be in control of the courtroom and the proceedings. This is not inconsistent with the adversary process or with being humane and consider - ate. The interests of parties, counsel, and jurors are best served by making prompt, firm, and fair rulings, keeping the trial moving in an orderly and expedi - tious fashion, barring cumulative and unnecessary evidence, and holding all par - ticipants to high professional standards (see infra section 22.35 for discussion of judicial control of time and proof). Adhering to these management principles will help reduce the stress and tension of a long trial. The judge should be sensitive to the right of counsel in the adversarial process to employ legitimate strategies and tactics to serve the interests of their clients, consistent with fairness and efficiency. Counsel should have a clear understanding of the judge’s courtroom procedure, such as the location from which witnesses are to be examined and the mechanics for submitting exhibits to witnesses, the clerk, or the jury. Some judges have found providing written guidelines helpful to attorneys, particularly those attorneys unfamiliar with local customs. In jury trials judges should use restraint in questioning witnesses lest they ap - pear, albeit unwittingly, to be taking sides or disrupting counsel’s presentation. It is generally advisable to refrain from asking questions until counsel have finished their examination and even then to limit questions to matters requiring clarification. See infra section 22.35. 378 . This section sets out general principles; for specific actions the judge may take to control the presentation of evidence at trial, see infra § 22.35."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 22.3 Presentation of Evidence .31 Glossaries/Indexes/Demonstrative Aids 136 .32 Use of Exhibits 137 .33 Depositions 138 .331 Summaries 139 .332 Editing, Designations, and Extracts 139 .333 Presentation/Videotaped Depositions 140 .334 Alternative Means of Presenting Testimony 142 .34 Sequencing of Evidence and Arguments 143 .35 Judicial Control/Time Limits 144 Although the presentation of the evidence at trial is normally controlled by the strategies and tactics of counsel, in complex litigation other considerations also require attention, primarily jury comprehension and the length of the trial. These are not unrelated concepts, since a shorter trial promotes jury comprehension, and effective presentation of evidence saves time. Moreover, many jurors in to - day’s society expect information to be presented succinctly, even where it deals with legal or other complex matters. While recognizing counsel’s prerogatives, the judge should nevertheless take responsibility for encouraging and directing the use of techniques that will facili - tate comprehension and expedition, primarily simplification of facts and evi - dence, use of plain language, and use of visual and other aids. Some techniques are time-tested, others are more creative. While some are concerned that innova - tive practices risk error, their potential to improve the trial process justifies their consideration. 22.31 Glossaries/Indexes/Demonstrative Aids Jury comprehension can be significantly enhanced by aids that organize massive evidence and familiarize jurors with relevant vocabulary. Such aids include glos - saries of important terms, names, dates, and events, informative indexes of ex - hibits to assist in identification and retrieval, and time lines of important events in the case. To the extent feasible, the parties should develop glossaries, indexes, and time lines as joint exhibits. They may be prepared using the procedure sug - gested for developing statements of agreed and disputed facts (see supra section 21.47); if necessary, the court can refer disputes to a magistrate judge. Stipulated facts should be presented in the form of a logically organized statement. Jurors understand better and remember more when information is presented visually rather than only verbally. Graphics, such as charts and diagrams, are commonly used demonstrative aids (see supra section 22.21 on the use of demonstrative aids during opening statements and infra section 34.32 on com - puter-generated graphics). This type of demonstrative evidence may be admitted"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Trial 137 whatever its source, when in the judge’s discretion it will help the trier of fact un - derstand other evidence. 379 Graphics can be deceptive, however. For example, the physical representation of data (i.e., the area occupied on the chart) may be disproportionate to the ratio of the numbers represented. The relationship of data may also be distorted by representation (e.g., representing one-dimensional data by three-dimensional bars), creating a misleading visual reaction. Graphs of amounts of money may not be shown in constant dollars. Graphs taking figures out of context or using different scales may create the appearance of dispropor - tionately large or small differences in data. 380 22.32 Use of Exhibits Ordinarily exhibits are offered for the purpose of communicating to the jury some significant fact. Exhibits should be presented in a manner that will achieve that purpose (except when an exhibit is simply a link in a chain of proof). Thus, documentary proof should be redacted to eliminate irrelevant matter and its con - tents offered, whenever possible, by way of summary or other streamlined proce - dure that will help focus the jury’s attention to the material portions. See supra section 21.492. Circulating exhibits among the jurors is time consuming, disrupts the exami - nation of witnesses, and should be avoided except where the physical qualities of an object are themselves relevant. Whenever possible, exhibits should be dis - played so that the jurors and the judge can view them while hearing related testi - mony. Some options include: • Enlargements. They may be posted, or projected on a screen located so as to be easily visible to the witness, judge, and jurors; counsel will then be able to direct attention to particular portions of an exhibit during exami - nation. • Computerized imaging systems. In document-intensive cases, such sys - tems facilitate the storage, retrieval, and presentation of documents and graphics (see discussion of laser discs and CD-ROM in supra section 21.444 and infra sections 34.33–34.34). Devices such as bar code note - books permit instantaneous retrieval for display of documents, video - taped and other depositions (see infra section 22.33), and computer - generated graphics (see infra section 34.32). Although the systems used may vary—the parties will usually want to develop their systems indepen - dently to maintain confidentiality and exclusive access and control— counsel may be able to agree on common courtroom hardware (such as 379 . See 2 McCormack on Evidence § 212 at 9–10 (4th ed. 1992). 380 . See Edward R. Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (1983) and Envisioning Information (1990)."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"138 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third monitors, see infra section 34.31). If technologically advanced systems are to be used, counsel should familiarize themselves with their operation, and should test them before trial to avoid later problems that may disrupt the presentation of evidence. Such systems (and the preparation they re - quire) may be costly, but can significantly assist jury comprehension and expedite trial. They may also, however, affect a jury’s evaluation of the relative positions of the parties in unpredictable ways; some jurors may be swayed by high-tech evidence, while others are more impressed with a chart on a cardboard poster. • Copies and exhibit books. In some cases it may be cost-effective for counsel simply to provide jurors with individual copies of selected ex - hibits central to the presentation at trial. These may then be organized, indexed (with updates as needed), and placed in individual binders either before or during trial when the jury is not sitting. Exhibits may be ac - companied on separate pages by a summary of counsel’s contentions concerning their significance; if juror note taking is allowed (see the dis - cussion of juror notebooks in infra section 22.42), space may be left for juror notes relating to exhibits. Other less important exhibits may be dis - tributed and collected by the courtroom clerk on a daily basis, with jurors instructed not to make notes on their copies. Attention should also be given to the physical handling of exhibits during the trial in order to avoid cumbersome and time-consuming procedures. To the ex - tent possible, exhibits should have been premarked and previously received into evidence. Copies of the exhibits to be used with a witness should be available to the witness on the stand and in the hands of counsel before the examination be - gins. If voluminous, they can be kept in tabbed notebooks stacked on a cart lo - cated within easy reach of the witness; counsel can then direct the witness to the volume and tab number of exhibits as needed. 22.33 Depositions .331 Summaries 139 .332 Editing, Designations, and Extracts 139 .333 Presentation/Videotaped Depositions 140 .334 Alternative Means of Presenting Testimony 142 Because the reading of depositions at trial is boring for the jury and a poor way to communicate information, 381 it should be avoided whenever possible, and techniques such as those discussed below should be considered. 381 . One judge has called the reading of depositions “[b]eyond a doubt, the single least effective method of communicating information to a jury.” Parker, supra note 376, at 550."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Trial 139 22.331 Summaries If the contents of a deposition is a necessary element of a party’s proof, the pre - ferred mode of presentation should be a succinct stipulated statement or sum - mary of the material facts that can be read to the jury. The parties should be di - rected to attempt to reach agreement on a fair statement of the substance of the testimony, possibly with the assistance of a magistrate judge. The effectiveness of summaries may be increased when combined with video presentation, as dis - cussed below. 22.332 Editing, Designations, and Extracts A fair presentation of the contents of a deposition may, however, also require pre - senting to the jury a colloquy with the witness. The portions read should be lim - ited to the essential testimony of the witness, but may include not only the depo - nent’s “final” answer but also testimony that reflects demeanor, attitude, recol - lection, and other matters affecting credibility. Rather than going through a de - position to eliminate unnecessary portions, counsel should be directed to select for designation only the genuinely material parts that cannot be presented by way of summary. Background information, such as that bearing on the qualifications of an expert, may be covered by a brief stipulation read to the jury in advance. Most of the contents of pretrial depositions are irrelevant or at least unnecessary at trial; the material portions rarely exceed a few lines or pages. Before trial, each party should be required to designate those portions of de - positions it intends to read at trial. Using this information, other counsel can designate additional portions, if any, to be read. 382 The process is repeated un til, after a series of exchanges, the parties have finished designating the portions to be offered. Those portions usually will be introduced at trial in the same sequence in which they appear in the deposition, although another sequence can be adopted if it would improve comprehension. A common and convenient method for making designations is for the parties to enclose the portions to be offered in brackets on the pages of the deposition, each using a different color. Opposite the brackets other parties may indicate any objections in abbreviated language (e.g., “D obj. hearsay, not best evidence”). The court’s rulings may be indicated in a similar fashion, enabling counsel to read only the admitted portions from the original deposition. Developments during trial may cause changes in the parts of depositions that the parties want to offer. Ordinarily the court should permit parties to change their designations, as long as other parties are advised promptly of such changes 382 . Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4), if only a part of a deposition is offered, “an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other part.” See also Fed. R. Evid. 106."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third and have sufficient notice to revise their counterdesignations. Alternatively, in a long trial the court may allow counsel to designate portions of depositions to be offered several days before their expected use. 22.333 Presentation/Videotaped Depositions In nonjury cases, relevant excerpts of depositions or summaries can be prepared and offered as exhibits, usually without being read at trial and transcribed by the court reporter. The judge can later read these excerpts along with other exhibits in the record, but should instead hear the testimony if expecting to rule from the bench. The same procedure can be used in jury trials; it will reduce the volume of deposition evidence but increase the number of exhibits. In jury cases, deposition testimony is usually read by attorneys or paralegals; the use of actors for this purpose has generally been discouraged. The judge needs to be concerned that the reader’s pauses, inflection, and tone do not unfairly dis - tort the witness’s deposition testimony. If a tape recording (sometimes made by court reporters during depositions as a back-up to their notes) is available, it may be played for the jury at critical points. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(c), deposition testimony may be offered at trial in nonstenographic form (indeed, in a jury trial, on a party’s request it must be so presented if available unless the court for good cause orders otherwise) if the offering party provides a transcript of the pertinent portions to the court and (under Rule 26(a)(3)(B)) to other parties. Recordings may, however, be difficult to hear and understand. Videotape is generally more effective for the presentation of deposition testi - mony, for impeachment and rebuttal, and for reference during argument. 383 Videotaped depositions may be used routinely or for key witnesses only; any party may videotape a deposition without court order. 384 As with all deposi tions, videotaped depositions should be purged of irrelevant and inadmissible matter. Although videotaped depositions may be more time consuming and difficult to edit, doing so allows the proponent to present testimony in a logical and comprehensible manner. Typically, testimony concerning various matters will be interspersed throughout the witness’s testimony; editing by subject matter provides a more coherent presentation. 385 To aid comprehension, a witness’s testimony from multiple depositions may be combined into a single presentation 383 . For discussion of the use of videotaped depositions during argument, see Henke, supra note 209, 16 Am. J. Trial Advoc. at 165 ( citing Gregory P. Joseph, Modern Visual Evidence § 3.03[2][f] (1984)). 384 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(2), (3). To avoid an unfair difference in emphasis, however, the court should not allow testimony to be presented by different means on direct and cross-examination. See Traylor v. Husqvarna Motor, 988 F.2d 729, 734 (7th Cir. 1993) (disapproving presentation of live direct testimony and videotaped cross). 385 . See Parker, supra note 376, at 552."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Trial 141 (variations in setting or the witness’s clothing should be explained to the jury). Extending this principle, the testimony of multiple witnesses relating to the same subject may be spliced together and played for the jury at the point when that subject is at issue. Videotaped depositions are also an efficient means for repeat - edly presenting the same testimony of a witness—such as an expert or corporate official—in different trials involving the same issue. 386 Split-screen techniques can be effective in depositions relating to, or in which the witness refers to, documents or other exhibits. 387 The witness may be pre - sented on one side and the document or exhibit on the other, with portions re - ferred to highlighted for emphasis and clarity. This allows the jury to observe the witness’s testimony in context without the distraction of having to look away from the monitor. 388 The use of deposition summaries, discussed in the preceding section, may be improved by combination with video presentation. A portion of a videotaped de - position may be shown to the jury and the remainder summarized. This com - bines the time savings of summaries with the opportunity to observe witnesses on video. If in counsel’s judgment dispersed portions of a videotaped deposition are of particular importance, summaries may be interrupted by video presentation. The same end may be accomplished by uninterrupted presentation of a video portraying the witness’s testimony interspersed with periodic summaries recorded by counsel in advance of trial. As with written depositions, when edited versions of videotaped depositions are offered, other parties may request introduction of deleted parts. 389 Counsel should therefore provide other parties access to recordings in their entirety before trial, allow them to designate the portions they contend should be shown, and present unresolved disputes promptly to the court. While video provides potentially attractive and effective alternatives to con - ventional presentation of deposition testimony, the persuasive power of visual presentation carries with it the potential for prejudice, a risk heightened by the opportunities for manipulation provided by technology, making rulings on ob - jections critical. Unless the parties can reach substantial agreement on the form and content of the videotape to be shown to the jury, the process of passing on objections can be so burdensome and time consuming as to be impractical for the court. It is therefore advisable to address the process for determining the admis - sibility of videotape testimony early in the litigation, before the parties have made extensive investments. 386 .

In such circumstances, the examination of witnesses has been conducted using satellite or other remote video transmission. 391 The procedure for examination is similar to that used in the courtroom—the witness is sworn and examined on direct and cross—though additional safeguards may be needed. 392 The cost should generally be borne by the party calling the witness, though a portion may be allocated to other parties who prolong examination by extensive cross-examination or objections. 393 Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a), however, requires that testimony be taken “orally in open court.” 394 Nevertheless, although courts have disagreed on whether (in the absence of agreement) the rule permits testimony to be taken telephonically, 395 televised transmission has not been held to violate the rule. In criminal cases, re - mote transmission of testimony may violate Fed. R. Crim. P. 26 (whose text is identical to that of Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a)) or the Confrontation Clause, 396 and 390 .

This technique was used in the San Juan litigation, MDL 721, and In re Washington Public Power Supply Sys. Litig., MDL 551. In both cases, the court held that witnesses (at least if under a party’s control) may be compelled to testify by such means despite being beyond the court’s subpoena power, reasoning that the limits on that power are intended only to protect witnesses from undue inconvenience. See San Juan , 129 F.R.D. at 426 (approving Judge Browning’s reasoning in Washington Public ). 392 .

In any event, prior to resort to this tech - nique, counsel and the court should consider all alternatives. 397 22.34 Sequencing of Evidence and Arguments Jury recollection and comprehension in lengthy and complex trials may be en - hanced by altering the traditional order of trial. Techniques that have been used include the following: • Evidence presented by issues . Rather than have evidence presented in the conventional order, the court may organize the trial in logical order, issue by issue, with both sides presenting their opening statements and evi - dence on a particular issue before moving to the next. See supra section 22.21. This procedure, roughly equivalent to severance of issues for trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), can help the jury deal with complex issues and voluminous evidence, but may result in inefficiencies if witnesses must be recalled and evidence repeated. • Arguments presented by issues/sequential verdicts. If it is impractical to arrange the entire trial in an issue-by-issue format, it may still be helpful to arrange closing arguments by issue, with both sides making their clos - ings on an issue before moving to the next. The entire case may be sub - mitted to the jury at the conclusion of all argument, or the issues may be submitted sequentially (see infra section 22.451 (special verdicts and gen - eral verdicts with interrogatories) and infra section 33.86 (civil RICO tri - als)). The latter procedure may be advantageous if a decision on one issue would render others moot or if the early resolution of pivotal issues will facilitate settlement; on the other hand, it can lengthen the total time for deliberations and requires recurrent recesses while the jury deliberates. • Interim statements and arguments. Some judges have found that in a lengthy trial it can be helpful to the trier of fact for counsel from time to time to summarize the evidence that has been presented or outline forth - coming evidence. Such statements may be scheduled periodically (for ex - ample, at the start of each trial week), or counsel may be allowed to make one when they think appropriate, with each side allotted a fixed amount of time to use as it sees fit. Some judges, in patent and other scientifically complex cases, have permitted counsel to explain to the jury how the tes - timony of an expert will assist them in deciding an issue. Although such procedures are often described as “interim arguments,” it may be more accurate to consider them “supplementary opening statements” since the 397 . See In re Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., 720 F. Supp. 1379, 1390 (D. Ariz. 1989) (court required plaintiffs to choose among (1) foregoing testimony, (2) offering video taped or written depositions, or (3) taking testimony by live satellite transmission)."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"144 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third purpose is to aid the trier of fact in understanding and remembering the evidence and not to argue the case. The court should remind the jury of the difference between evidence and counsel’s statements. 398 Interim jury instructions, discussed in infra section 22.433, may also be helpful. 22.35 Judicial Control/Time Limits Ordinarily limits on time and on evidence will be set at the pretrial conference in order that counsel can plan accordingly before the trial begins. See supra section 21.643. But the course of the trial may make it appropriate for the court to assert its authority under Fed. R. Evid. 611(a) to “exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make [it] effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless con - sumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embar - rassment.” While courts should be reluctant to interfere with counsel’s control over the presentation of their case and should ensure that each side has the op - portunity to present its case fully and fairly, judicial intervention may become necessary if evidence exceeds reasonable bounds and does not contribute to the resolution of the issues presented. Thus, courts should consider limiting or bar - ring the examination of witnesses whose testimony is unnecessary or would be merely cumulative and calling for stipulations where a number of witnesses would testify to the same facts. The court may also review the order in which wit - nesses are to be called, to determine if it would interfere with an orderly trial (as when counsel tries to call an adversary’s expert witness before critical evidence has been presented and before the party’s own expert has testified). When par - ticular, clearly defined subject matter requiring the testimony of two or more per - sons is involved, it may be efficient to examine the witnesses simultaneously, al - lowing the more knowledgeable witness to answer. This may require consent of counsel, in view of the parties’ right under Fed. R. Evid. 615 to have witnesses ex - cluded. 399 Opposing expert witnesses may be examined one after the other in order to clearly frame their agreements and disagreements for the trier of fact. Judges generally refrain from interfering with counsel’s mode of questioning, except when called on to rule on objections. But when the questioning is confus - ing, repetitive, or irrelevant and threatens to delay the trial, the court may need to limit the examination by acting under Fed. R. Evid. 611(a) and under Fed. R. Evid. 403, which permits exclusion even of relevant testimony “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by . . . considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” The court should con - sider intervening, even without objection, to (1) bar testimony on undisputed or 398 . See Parker, supra note 376, at 553–54. 399 . Expert witnesses needed to advise counsel are not subject to exclusion. See Fed. R. Evid. 615(3) advisory committee’s note."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Trial 145 clearly cumulative facts, 400 or matters beyond the scope of the examination; (2) clarify confusing questions or answers; (3) prohibit repeated paraphrasing of an - swers into new, duplicative questions; 401 and (4) encourage stipulations by op - posing counsel to avoid routine testimony, such as the date of a document. Some courts have found it effective to issue guidelines providing, among other things, that the court will: • refrain from instructing witnesses to answer “yes or no” to questions that are (1) compound, (2) require a witness to make or accept a characteri - zation rather than testify to a fact, or (3) are argumentative in form or substance; • bar questions framed as arguments rather than requests for testimony that the witness is competent to give; • prohibit questions asking one witness to comment on the credibility of another, unless prior request is made outside of the jury’s presence; and • sustain objections on the ground that an answer is nonresponsive only when made by interrogating counsel. As noted in supra section 21.643, time limits (if imposed) should usually be established before trial. The burdens on jurors and on the public’s access to the court when a trial grows unduly long, however, may require the court to consider setting limits during trial, taking care to avoid prejudicing either side. The mere threat of such limits may cause counsel to expedite the trial. If limits are imposed, they may grant each party a specified number of hours for all direct and cross - examination, restrict the time for specific arguments, or limit the time for examination of particular witnesses. Once limits have been imposed, extensions should be granted only for good cause, taking into account the requesting party’s good faith efforts to stay within the limits and the degree of prejudice should an extension be denied. At times it may be appropriate for the judge, exercising the authority under Fed. R. Evid. 614, to question witnesses called by the parties. In jury trials, this au - thority should be exercised with restraint to avoid the appearance of partiality or interference with counsel’s trial strategy, and should be limited to clarifying mat - ters on which the jury may be confused. 402 Rule 614 also gives the court author ity to call its own witnesses (subject to cross-examination by the parties), an au - 400 . Testimony may be disallowed as cumulative if it relates to evidence to be covered in later testimony. 401 . Typical examples include questions that begin “Do I understand you to mean that . . .”; “Is it your testimony then that . . .”; “Is it fair to say that . . .”; and the like. 402 . The advisory committee’s note to Rule 614 state that “the authority [to question witnesses] is . . . abused when the judge abandons his proper role and assumes that of advocate,” and point out that such abuse may be grounds for reversal."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third thority that should rarely be exercised other than with respect to an expert ap - pointed by the court under Fed. R. Evid. 706 (see supra section 21.51).

Jury manage - ment raises a number of issues which, though discussed in the following sections, should also be taken up at the final pretrial conference. Aside from the largely mechanical matters here discussed, it is well for court and counsel to have in mind the critical role jurors play in the justice process. Although they are the decision makers, they are often made to feel like the forgot - ten participants in the trial: evidence is presented with little attention to the ju - rors, they are kept in the dark about much of what is happening in court, and fre - quently they are left to wait while the judge and counsel are busy with other mat - ters. High on the judge’s list of concerns, therefore, should be the considerate and courteous treatment of jurors by counsel, staff, and the court itself. 22.41 Impaneling the Jury 403 Size of the venire and the panel. To minimize the burden on citizens and the cost to the court, the number of prospective jurors summoned should be no greater 403 . See generally Bench Book, supra note 42, §§ 2.02–2.03."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Trial 147 than is reasonably necessary, taking into account such factors as the size of jury panel desired for trial, the nature of the case, and the number of jurors likely to be excused. Enough persons must be called, however, so that the court will not run out of prospective jurors in the course of the selection process. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 48, between six and twelve jurors must be selected for a civil trial. 404 Though jurors may be excused during trial for good cause, 405 federal courts no longer seat alternates in civil trials; all jurors not excused participate in deliberations. Absent stipulation, 406 the court may not accept a verdict from a jury of fewer than six. 407 The court should seat enough jurors to minimize the risk of a mis trial, considering the probability of incapacity, disqualification, or other devel opments requiring the excuse of jurors during trial. The primary factor, of course, is the expected length of trial. One rule of thumb is to select eight jurors for a trial expected to last up to two months, ten jurors for a trial expected to last four months, and twelve jurors for a longer trial. In determining the appropriate size of the jury, the judge may also consider asking the parties if they will stipulate that in the event of a hung jury they will accept a verdict from a less than unanimous jury 408 or allow the case to be decided on the record by the court. 409 The par ties may be more amenable to entering such agreements before voir dire than af ter the jury has been selected. Voir dire. The court may examine prospective jurors itself or allow the parties to do so. 410 If the court conducts the examination, it must “permit the parties or their attorneys to supplement the examination by such further inquiry as it deems proper or . . . itself submit to the prospective jurors such additional ques tions of the parties or their attorneys as it deems proper.” 411 Where the judge conducts voir dire, the attorneys should also be invited to submit proposed ques tions in 404 . Local rules may also address jury size. Criminal cases require a jury of twelve, but before verdict the parties may stipulate to a jury of fewer than twelve and a verdict returned by fewer than twelve. Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b). 405 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 47(c). 406 . While the parties may stipulate to the return of a verdict by a jury of fewer than six, cf . Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149, 164 (1973) (referring to possibility without comment), the advi - sory committee’s note to Rule 48 suggests that this be avoided. In addition to raising constitutional issues, smaller juries may be less reliable. There is considerable support for seating a jury of twelve, particularly in complex cases. See the discussion and citations in Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223 (1978) (criminal conviction by jury of fewer than six violates due process). 407 . The Colgrove court held that a six-person jury satisfied the Seventh Amendment, but explicitly declined to comment on the constitutionality of a smaller number. 413 U.S. at 159–60. 408 . See Fed. R.

The court may allow counsel to conduct the entire voir dire, subject to reasonable control necessary to avoid extending the process unduly and to limit the attorneys to inquiring about juror qualifications rather than arguing the case. In light of constitutional restrictions on the use of peremptory challenges on discriminatory grounds, greater leeway may need to be given to counsel in voir dire to lay the foundation for appropriate challenges. Procedures for the conduct of voir dire vary widely. Inquiries may be directed to the venire, to smaller panels, to jurors one at a time, or by a combination of these methods; challenges may then be exercised privately or before the prospec - tive jurors. Challenges may be made by alternate strikes or presentation of lists, simultaneously or alternating, and the parties may or may not know the identity, order, and other information about replacement jurors before making a chal - lenge. 412 Whatever method the court decides to use, to avoid confusion and prejudice counsel should be informed before trial begins. In cases involving potentially large jury venires, pre-voir dire jury question - naires are often mailed to prospective jurors to elicit basic information and identify prospective jurors unable to serve. This procedure avoids unnecessary trips to court, but may lead to an excessive number of requests to be excused and to inappropriate inquiries about the case. An alternative is to have prospective ju - rors complete a questionnaire in court before voir dire. 413 During voir dire, prospective jurors should be informed of the expected length of trial, the trial schedule, and other facts that may bear on a juror’s ability and qualifications to serve. The prospect of a long trial may produce many re - quests to be excused, creating the risk of a jury consisting predominantly of per - sons who are retired or otherwise not employed outside their home. The judge can reduce requests for excuses by making introductory comments emphasizing the responsibilities of citizenship, stressing the importance of juries being com - posed of a representative cross-section of the population, describing the litigation so as to point out the challenge and opportunity of service, and reminding the venire of the fact that only a few will be selected to serve. 412 . While the struck panel system allows the attorneys to make more informed challenges, it has been criticized as encouraging improperly motivated challenges and increasing the likelihood of objections based on Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 111 S. Ct. 2077 (1991) (prohibiting pri - vate litigants from exercising race-based peremptory challenges). See Leonard B. Sand & Steven A. Reiss, A Report on Seven Experiments Conducted by District Court Judges in the Second Circuit, 60 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 423, 425 & nn.16–17 (1985). See also J.E.B. v. Alabama, 114 S.

In civil (and misdemeanor) cases, each party is al - lowed three peremptory challenges. 414 Several plaintiffs or several defendants may be considered a single party for that purpose, but the court may allow addi tional challenges, depending on whether parties’ interests conflict or diverge significantly. Additional challenges should be granted sparingly because they will increase the size of the venire and lengthen voir dire and the jury-selection pro - cess. Presumptively, each side should have the same number of challenges. 415 22.42 Juror Note Taking/Notebooks/Questions Note taking. Permitting jurors to take notes, once discouraged, has now become widely accepted. The arguments in favor of permitting it are particularly com - pelling in long and complicated trials. 416 Concerns over note taking are mini - mized by the fact that many jurors will not take notes, but denying them permis - sion to do so is demeaning and inconsistent with the large measure of responsi - bility the system places on jurors, and it may hamper their performance. Jurors should be provided with paper (or notebooks with space for notes, see supra sec - tion 22.32) and pens. Some judges instruct jurors that notes are only for the in - dividual juror’s use and should not be shown or read to others, that note taking should not distract them from observing the witnesses, and that notes should be left in the jury room during recesses. Juror notebooks. In addition to holding exhibits provided to individual ju- rors during the trial (see supra section 22.32), notebooks may provide jurors with information that will be helpful to them to organize and retain the information adduced during the trial, such as witness and exhibit lists, pictures of witnesses, chronologies and time lines, glossaries (see supra section 22.31), and excerpts from instructions. 417 The court should control the amount of material in the notebooks to ensure that they remain clear and useful. 414 . 28 U.S.C. § 1870; Fed.

Some judges have found that permitting jurors to ask ques - tions in open court (in civil cases) can be helpful to jury comprehension. Others require that any questions be submitted in writing for consideration by the judge and counsel. The judge may say nothing on this subject, or may inform jurors that questions are permitted at the conclusion of a witness’s examination, for the purpose of helping them understand the evidence; jurors may be cautioned, how - ever, that it is for the lawyers to try the case and that matters occurring to them during one witness’s examination may later be covered by another’s. 418 22.43 Jury Instructions 419 .431 General Principles 150 .432 Preliminary Instructions 151 .433 Interim and Limiting Instructions 152 .434 Final Instructions 153 .435 Supplemental Instructions and Readbacks 155 22.431 General Principles Jurors cannot be expected to render an intelligent verdict if the instructions are unintelligible to them. When a trial is complex and protracted, the need for in - structions the jury will understand is particularly compelling. Instructions should therefore use language that lay persons can understand, be concise, concrete, and simple, use the active voice, avoid negatives and double-negatives, and be orga - nized in logical sequence for the reader. As discussed in supra section 21.65, the court should direct counsel to submit proposed instructions at the final pretrial conference to focus the attention of the court and counsel on the issues to be tried. Substantive instructions should be tailored to the particular case, avoiding generalized pattern instructions. Propositions of law should be explained with reference to the facts and parties in the case; illustrations familiar to jurors may also help. Instructions phrased in the language of appellate opinions are not likely to be meaningful to jurors. Most judges reword counsel’s proposed instructions, which tend to be argumentative and one-sided, into language of their own, or at least edit them substantially. Simply combining the proposals submitted by coun - sel for each side is unlikely to produce sound and intelligible instructions. Instructions should be read to the jury with appropriate emphasis and variation 418 . The pros and cons of juror questioning, and the procedures to follow if it is allowed, are discussed in United States v. Johnson, 914 F.2d 136, 137–39 (8th Cir. 1990) (criminal); DeBenedetto v.

One or more copies of the instructions should then be sent into the jury room (see infra section 22.434). 22.432 Preliminary Instructions It is difficult for jurors to deal effectively with the evidence presented during a lengthy trial if they have no framework of the factual and legal issues to give struc ture and context to what they see and hear. Moreover, the jurors should under stand the trial process in which they are about to participate and what they can expect. Preliminary instructions provide context and basic guidance for the con duct of jurors. They will typically cover the following subjects: • Preliminary statement of legal principles and factual issues. The instruc - tions should summarize the key factual issues, including a statement of the facts and the parties’ major contentions (which may be drafted jointly by the parties), and explain briefly the basic legal issues and principles, such as the elements of claims and defenses to be proved. The court should emphasize that these instructions are preliminary—that no effort is made to cover all of the issues or principles—and that deliberations will be governed by the final instructions to be given at the conclusion of the case. Since one purpose of these instructions is to prepare jurors for opening statements, they are usually given first, with counsel permitted to refer to them in their opening statements. The judge may, however, defer instructions until after opening statements or give supplemental prelimi - nary instructions at that time. • The conduct of the trial. Jurors should be informed of the course of the trial from opening statements to verdict, the methods by which evidence is presented, and the procedure for raising and resolving objections. In some cases, such as those involving charges of conspiracy, the court may wish to inform the jury that cooperation among the litigants at trial has been urged by the court and should not be taken as evidence of concerted action with respect to the matters at issue in the litigation. • Schedule. In addition to the hourly and daily schedule established for the trial of the case, jurors should be advised of any holidays or other planned recesses. • Precautions to prevent mistrial. 420 The court should direct jurors not to discuss the case or communicate with trial participants. It should warn against exposure to publicity and attempts at independent fact-finding, 420 . See also infra § 22.44 (avoiding mistrial)."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third such as viewing the scene of some occurrence or undertaking experi - ments or research. • Pretrial procedures. The judge should consider describing briefly the various discovery devices that have been used during the pretrial stage of the litigation, such as depositions, document production, and interroga - tories. Not only will this information be helpful when such evidence is later introduced, but it also serves to explain why parties have possession of, or know about, various matters involving other persons. • The functions and duties of the jury. The instructions might also include such matters as the jury’s role as fact-finder, the burden of proof, assess - ing the credibility of witnesses, the nature of evidence, including circum - stantial evidence and the purpose of rules of evidence, and the jurors’ need to rely on their recollection of testimony (including any special in - structions about the use of juror notebooks, note taking, or questions). Most of these instructions should be repeated in the final jury charge, supplemented by any special explanations (such as use of convictions to impeach credibility) warranted by developments at trial or the use of special verdicts or interrogatories. 421 22.433 Interim and Limiting Instructions Developments in the course of trial will from time to time create the need for additional instructions. Under Fed. R. Evid. 105, when evidence is admitted that is admissible as to some but not all parties or for a limited purpose only, the court must, upon request, instruct the jury accordingly. At counsel’s request, the court may repeat such limiting instructions at the close of trial. Where the offer of such evidence is contemplated, counsel should raise the issue with the court promptly (if possible, before trial) and submit proposed instructions. The judge should also consider giving instructions at any point in the trial where they might be helpful to the jury; an explanation of applicable legal prin - ciples may be more helpful when given at the time the issue arises than if deferred until the close of trial. It is advisable to permit counsel to comment or object be - fore the court gives an instruction. As with preliminary instructions, the court should caution the jury that these are only interim explanations, and that the final, complete instructions on which they will base their verdict will be given at the close of trial. If the parties are presenting their evidence according to a pre - scribed sequence of issues (see supra section 22.34), the judge may structure in - structions accordingly. 421 . See infra §§ 22.435 (supplemental instructions), 22.45 (verdicts)."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Trial 153 22.434 Final Instructions Although proposed instructions should generally be submitted to the court in connection with the final pretrial conference, developments during the trial may require that they be revised or supplemented. Counsel are entitled to file written requests for instructions “at the close of the evidence or at such earlier time as the court reasonably directs,” and are entitled to notice of the judge’s proposed action on them before closing arguments. 422 Most judges, rather than responding to particular requests, prefer to provide counsel with the entire charge they propose to give. The court will then hold a charge conference to consider counsel’s objec - tions and requests; generally there will be little controversy if the instructions have been prepared by the court. 423 The judge may expedite the process by asking that proposed instructions be submitted on disks in compatible word-pro cessing programs for ease of editing. Final instructions may be given before or after closing arguments, or both. 424 Though traditionally instructions have been given after, there are ad vantages to giving the bulk of the instructions before argument. 425 Instructions on the law may make closing arguments easier to understand, and counsel, instead of previewing the court’s instructions during argument, can refer to in structions already given in arguing their application to the facts. Hearing the in structions may also help counsel structure their arguments. The court should, however, reserve the final closing instruction until after arguments, reminding the jury of the instructions previously given and instructing them about the proce dures to be followed in deliberations. 426 Most judges provide jurors with copies of the instructions for use during de - liberations. 427 If this is done, jurors should be informed in advance so that they can listen to the charge for a general understanding rather than try to memorize it. Some judges consider it preferable for jurors not to have the written charge in hand while the court is delivering the instructions, lest their attention be diverted by their own reading. Others consider it helpful to permit the jurors to follow the text, or at least to give them a brief topical outline with which they can follow the 422 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 51; Fed. R. Crim.

Some courts have also experimented with providing jurors with a tape recording of their charge for use during deliberations. See Sand & Reiss, supra note 412, at 456–59.

Jurors should be given any special verdict form or interrogatories for use during deliberations. The oral charge, which is normally transcribed by the court reporter, should be complete within itself (i.e., the judge should not merely refer to writings that the jury may be given). When delivering the charge, the judge should maintain eye contact with the jurors, sensing when to depart from the prepared text to re - peat, rephrase, or elaborate as seems necessary. Jurors should be told that, in the event of any variations between the oral and written charge, the oral charge con - trols and governs their deliberations. Some judges record the oral charge and send the tape into the jury room for reference. In complex litigation, it may sometimes be helpful for the judge to comment on evidence to explain subject matter foreign to jurors and to keep them from being confused or misled by adversarial presentations. Such comments can and should be made without taking sides, solely to assist comprehension. The judge should avoid expressing a personal opinion on disputed facts, 428 and should al - ways be and appear impartial. Before commenting on the evidence, the judge may submit the proposed language to counsel for comment and objections. The judge’s comments may be included with the written instructions given to the jury, but it may be preferable not to do so to avoid giving them undue weight. After all instructions have been given, counsel is entitled to record any objec - tions to the charge outside the presence and hearing of the jury and before it re - tires. 429 Objections and the grounds therefor must be stated distinctly or are deemed waived. 430 The judge can then give corrective or supplemental instruc - tions (see infra section 22.435) before deliberations begin. All exhibits received in evidence except items such as currency, narcotics, weapons, and explosive devices may be sent directly to the jury room for the ju - rors’ reference during deliberations, or the court may await requests from the jury. Another alternative is for the court to withhold some items—such as those received for impeachment or another limited purpose—until requested by the jury, when limiting instructions should be repeated. If the exhibits are volumi - nous, the jury should be given an index or other finding aid to assist their exami - nation (see supra section 22.31).

Because the volume of exhibits may make them unmanageable for the jury, counsel may agree to withhold some voluminous materials until specifically requested, particularly if they are mainly for background. 22.435 Supplemental Instructions and Readbacks Requests by the jury for supplemental instructions during deliberations should be handled in much the same manner as final instructions; the judge should deter - mine the appropriate response after consulting with counsel and permitting counsel to object to the proposed instruction on the record. Instructions should be given orally in open court and should include a reminder that the jury should consider them as a part of those previously given, which remain binding. The final instructions should advise the jurors that in deliberating on their verdict, they will not have a transcript available but will have to rely on the ex - hibits and their recollection of the testimony. Nevertheless, it is likely that after a long and complex trial the jury will request readbacks of testimony. The court should ask the jury to make their request as specific and narrow as possible to avoid excessively long readbacks. The judge should then confer with the attorneys to reach agreement, if possible, on the portions of the testimony to be read. If counsel have any objections, they should be permitted to state them on the record. Care should be taken during the readback to avoid unduly emphasizing any part of the evidence. 431 Some judges decline to authorize readbacks altogether, partly to save time and partly to avoid potentially unfair distortions of the record, but as a result make the jury’s task more difficult. A readback can sometimes be avoided, however, by an agreed statement of the parties’ positions on the matter at issue. 22.44 Avoiding Mistrial The potential for and consequences of mistrial, serious in all litigation, are aggra - vated in complex trials. The most obvious risk is the jury’s failure to reach a ver - dict. A stipulation permitting return of a less than unanimous verdict can reduce that risk. Using special verdicts and interrogatories (see infra section 22.451) and permitting juries to return a partial verdict on issues as to which they are able to reach agreement can also help. Most importantly, the facts and the law should be presented in ways that maximize jury comprehension. The risk of mistrial will also be reduced by taking precautions to shield the jury from improper contacts or exposure. The jury deliberation room should be “sanitized” before the jury retires, and all counsel should review all material be - fore it is sent into the room, to ensure that nothing extraneous is inadvertently 431 .

Precautions that can reduce the likelihood of a mistrial include the fol - lowing: • Cautionary instructions. As discussed in supra section 22.432, the jurors should be given, at the outset and periodically during the trial, appropri - ate instructions regarding improper conduct. The final instructions may also include a brief explanation of the consequences of a mistrial. • Sequestration. Sequestration of jurors should be considered only in ex - traordinary cases where public interest and media coverage are so intense as to jeopardize the fairness of the trial. See infra section 32.31. • Stipulations on verdict. In advance of trial, the court should encourage the parties to stipulate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 48 to accept a majority (i.e., not unanimous) verdict, or under Rule 39(a)(1) to accept a nonjury de - cision on the same evidence if a verdict cannot be obtained (see supra section 21.62). Such stipulations may be made during trial or delibera - tions—indeed, the parties may not seriously consider them until actually faced with the possibility of mistrial caused by the need to remove a ju - ror—but are generally easier to obtain in advance. • Loss of jurors during deliberations. As long as six jurors will remain, having to excuse or disqualify a juror during deliberations need have no effect. 432 If the loss of one or more jurors would reduce the jury to fewer than six members, however, the court cannot accept the resulting verdict (absent a stipulation, which should be sought before trial). 433 The court should try to avoid this situation by seating a sufficient number of jurors (see supra section 22.41). 22.45 Verdicts .451 Special Verdicts and General Verdicts with Interrogatories 156 .452 Judgment as a Matter of Law 158 .453 Return of Verdict 159 22.451 Special Verdicts and General Verdicts with Interrogatories Special verdicts and interrogatories are commonly used in complex trials.

Counsel and the court should consider the form of verdict during pretrial. Special verdicts may require the jury to return findings on each issue of fact, leaving the court to apply the law to the jury’s findings. 434 The preparation of special verdict forms can be complicated. 435 The language needs to be concise, clear, comprehensive, 436 and crafted to minimize the risk of inconsistent ver - dicts. 437 The judge should instruct the jury on how to complete the verdict form properly, as Rule 49 requires, including both the procedure for rendering special verdicts and the specific substantive issues to be decided. To simplify the process, the judge may have the jury return partial verdicts seriatim, instructing on each issue individually before the jury deliberates on it. Alternatively, the court may submit a general verdict with interrogatories. The jury both determines the facts and applies the law, but in addition makes findings on “issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.” 438 Some consider this procedure an attractive compromise between a simple general verdict and special verdicts, in that it maintains the traditional role of the jury while potentially avoiding the need to relitigate factual issues if an error of law taints the general verdict. On the other hand, interrogatories increase the length and complexity of deliberations and are more likely to produce inconsistencies. When the interrogatory answers are consistent with each other but inconsistent with the general verdict, the court may simply enter judgment according to the 434 . Some cases have held that the court may also amend special verdict responses to conform them to the jury’s obvious intention or correct a manifest error. See Aquachem Co., Inc. v. Olin Corp., 699 F.2d 516, 520 (11th Cir. 1983); Shaffer v. Great Am. Indem. Co., 147 F.2d 981 (5th Cir. 1945), but cf . Austin-Westshore Const. Co. Inc. v. Federated Dept.

P. 49(a), the court may use any “method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate,” as an alternative to the rule’s suggested methods of submitting “written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer,” or “written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence.” 436 . If any issue of fact raised by the pleadings is omitted, the parties will waive their right to a jury trial on that issue if they fail to demand its submission before the jury retires. If an issue is omitted without such demand, the court may make its own findings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a). 437 . Inconsistent verdicts are a concern even with standard verdict forms; careful structuring and instructions should minimize this risk. For a stark example of the danger of ambiguously drafted verdict forms, see Schiro v. Farley, No. 92-7549, slip. op. (Sup. Ct. Jan. 19, 1994), particu - larly Justice Stevens’ dissent at 2–4 & n.2, in which the Court upheld a death sentence based, in part, on a finding that the killing was intentional, despite the fact that the jury left blank the square on the verdict sheet that they were to check if they found the defendant guilty of intentional murder. 438 .

Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1), once a party has been fully heard on an issue, the court may determine the issue against that party if “there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.” The court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law on any “claim or defense that cannot . . . be maintained or defeated with - out a favorable finding on that issue.” The motion must “specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment,” in order to allow the opposing party an opportunity to correct any deficiencies in its proof. While it is appropriate in the interest of economy to grant such motions, when warranted, as soon as a party has completed presenta - tion on a fact essential to one or more of its claims or defenses, the court should not do so until the party has been apprised of the materiality of the fact and af - forded an opportunity to supplement its evidence on that fact. 442 A motion for judgment as a matter of law must be made before submission to the jury. Judges therefore frequently deny or submit such motions initially, even when they believe them to have merit, preferring to defer their resolution until after the jury renders a verdict. In this way, if the jury “gets it right” the judge need not disturb the verdict; any question of invading the province of the jury is avoided, and the verdict will be more difficult to overturn on appeal than would a judgment rendered on motion. If the jury instead renders a verdict lacking sufficient evidentiary support, the judge may then grant the motion upon its re - 439 . Id . 440 . See id .; Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores v.

Offsetting these advantages is the time and expense that might be saved by granting a meritorious motion. Motions for judgment as a matter of law may effectively be combined with the procedure discussed in supra section 22.34 for sequencing issues for trial. If is - sues likely to be dispositive are scheduled first, a ruling may reduce or obviate fur - ther proceedings. Thus, the judge may chose to deny a pivotal summary judg - ment motion during pretrial if its correct resolution is doubtful, while scheduling the trial to begin with presentation of the facts in issue (or scheduling a separate trial). 444 Even if not dispositive, early judicial resolution of issues unsubstanti ated by facts or law may significantly reduce the scope of evidence, argument, and instructions. An order granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law should be in writing or read into the record, and should state the court’s reasoning. 22.453 Return of Verdict 445 When the jury has returned a special verdict or a general verdict with interroga - tories, the judge and counsel should promptly review it for inconsistencies, in or - der that appropriate steps can be taken before the jury is discharged. The court should then, after consultation with counsel, promptly approve a form of judg - ment for entry by the clerk. 446 If the judgment does not resolve all aspects of the litigation, the court should consider entering final judgments as to some claims or parties to allow appeal to be taken. 447 Where issues have been bifurcated or submitted to the jury for seriatim ver - dicts, the jury may need to resume hearing evidence and further instructions or begin deliberations on other issues. 448 If a recess is called, the judge should in - struct the jurors that they remain under the restrictions originally imposed; if the recess extends more than a few days, a supplementary examination of jurors may be necessary on their return to determine whether grounds for disqualification have arisen in the interim.

Although nonjury trials may be conducted with less formality, procedures to promote clarity and expedition are still important. The court, for example, should not simply receive vast volumes of documents in the expectation that they will be sorted out during the decision process following trial; redaction, summaries, sampling, and other techniques should be considered here as in jury trials. This section discusses additional options for nonjury trials; the absence of a jury gives the judge greater freedom to exercise control over the conduct and shape of the trial. 22.51 Adopted Prepared Statements of Direct Testimony Where credibility or recollection is not at issue, and particularly when the evi - dence is complicated or technical, the court may order that the direct testimony of witnesses under the parties’ control be presented in substantial part through written statements prepared and submitted in advance of trial. 450 At trial, the witness is sworn, adopts the statement, 451 may supplement the written state ment orally, and is then cross-examined and perhaps questioned by the judge. The statement is received as an exhibit and is not read into the record. This procedure, particularly appropriate for expert witnesses, witnesses called to supply factual background, or those needing an interpreter, has several advan - tages. The proponent can ensure that it has made a clear and complete record; the judge and opposing counsel, having read the statement, are better able to under - stand and evaluate the witness’s testimony; opposing counsel can prepare for more effective cross-examination; and the reduction of the amount of live testi - mony saves time. 449 . The law of the circuit needs to be consulted for appropriate instructions. 450 . See Charles. R. Richey, Requiring Direct Testimony to be Submitted in Written Form Before Trial , 72 Geo. L.J. 73 (1983). Circuit law should be consulted on whether the consent of parties is required. 451 .

Some judges re - quire counsel to exchange proposed findings and conclusions before submission to the court, marking for the court the portions disputed and those not disputed. Findings should be drafted in neutral language, avoiding argument and conclu - sions, and identify the evidence expected to establish each finding. Proposed findings allow the judge to follow the evidence during trial, adopting, modifying, or rejecting findings as it proceeds. This process simplifies the court’s preparation of findings of fact, which, along with its conclusions of law, are required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). 453 Although the court’s preparation of findings is aided by the parties’ proposals (some judges require that they be submitted on computer disk for ease of adaptation), appellate courts frown on verbatim adoption of the par - ties’ findings. 454 Under Rule 52(a), the court’s findings of fact and conclusions may be filed as an opinion or memorandum of decision or read into the record in open court. The latter procedure accelerates the time of decision while enabling the court to refine its opinion later as needed. The court may defer the decision until after re - ceiving post-trial briefs. Briefs may not be necessary, however, if adequate pretrial memoranda have been filed. Some judges call for closing arguments immediately after the close of evidence, as in jury trials, and render their decisions promptly following the arguments. Whatever time savings may be realized by a bench trial can easily be lost if the case is not decided promptly. Decisions become more difficult as the record grows cold with the passage of time, and long delay undermines public confidence in the justice system.

Evidence admissible only on a nonjury issue may have to be presented without the jury present. The court must also consider the proper sequencing of the jury and nonjury decisions to comply with Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover , under which the right to a jury trial on legal claims may not be lost by a prior de - termination of equitable claims, except under “the most imperative circum - stances.” 455 22.6 Inability of Judge to Proceed Should the trial judge become unable to proceed after trial has begun, Fed. R. Civ. P. 63 permits any other judge to proceed with the trial upon certifying familiarity with the record 456 and determining that the parties will not be prejudiced. Fed. R. Crim. P. 25(a) is similar, but it (1) is limited to inability to proceed because of death, sickness, or “other disability,” (2) requires that the successor judge be from the same court, and (3) does not expressly require a finding of lack of prejudice (though constitutional considerations may require it). Fed. R. Crim. P. 25(b) makes more lenient provision for replacement of a judge after a verdict or finding of guilt. The rule requires the successor judge in a civil nonjury trial, upon request, to recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed, and who is available to testify again without “undue burden,” and permits the recall of any other wit - ness. 457 As a practical matter, it is unlikely that a successor judge will wish to decide a complex case without having heard all the direct and cross-examination of witnesses, unless the parties stipulate to a decision on the record. Whether a judge unable to proceed in a jury trial should be replaced to avoid mistrial in a complex case is a difficult question, depending in part on how close the trial is to completion. If the disability occurs near the start of the trial, declaring a mistrial may be the preferable course. On the other hand, if a large in - vestment of resources (not only the parties’ but also the jurors’ time) has been made in the trial, a mistrial should be avoided if the replacement judge has confidence that the trial can go forward without sacrificing fairness; note that one 455 . 359 U.S. 500, 510–11 (1959). 456 .

Indeed, the high stakes increase the incentive to avoid the risk of trial, and the burgeoning cost of pretrial activity places a premium on settling early in the litigation. At the same time, however, the large sums, high number of parties and counsel, and complexity of the issues magnify the difficulty of achieving settlement. This chapter addresses issues encountered in the settlement of complex liti - gation and suggests options for dealing with them. It focuses on the role of the trial judge, general principles and techniques to promote settlement, and special problems that may arise. Settlement of specific types of litigation is covered in in - fra section 30.4 (class actions), section 33.29 (mass tort litigation), section 33.36 (securities litigation), and section 33.55 (employment discrimination). 23.1 Trial Judge’s Role .11 General Principles 166 .12 Timing/Relationship to Discovery 167 .13 Specific Techniques to Promote Settlement 168 .14 Review and Approval 171 .15 Alternative Processes to Encourage Settlement 172 .151 Mediation 173 .152 Summary Jury Trial 175 .153 Minitrial 176"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"166 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 23.11 General Principles The parties must negotiate the settlement, but the judge can serve as a catalyst for settlement discussions, create an atmosphere conducive to compromise, and make suggestions helpful to the litigants. Beginning with the first conference, and from time to time throughout the litigation, the court should encourage the set - tlement process. The judge should raise the issue of settlement at the first oppor - tunity, inquiring whether any discussions have taken place or might be scheduled. As the case progresses, and the judge and counsel become better informed, the judge should continue to urge the parties to consider and reconsider their posi - tions on settlement in light of current and anticipated developments. The judge’s initiatives can facilitate negotiations by removing the obstacles created by attorneys’ reluctance to show weakness—to their clients or their op - ponents—by a willingness to compromise. Moreover, the court’s comments can help overcome the intransigence or militance of clients. The judge can assist the parties, without touching on the merits, by focusing their attention on the likely cost of litigating the case to conclusion, in fees, expenses, time, and other re - sources. The judge can be helpful in other ways, such as scheduling settlement conferences, directing or encouraging reluctant parties, insurers, and other po - tential contributors to participate, suggesting and arranging for the presence of a neutral person to assist negotiations, targeting discovery at information needed for settlement, and promptly deciding motions whose resolution will lay the groundwork for settlement. 459 The judge may be particularly helpful in identifying and encouraging consid - eration of nonmonetary solutions. Where, for example, the parties contemplate a continuing relationship, the judge may stimulate thought about innovative and mutually beneficial arrangements for the future that may pave the way for agree - ment on monetary terms. Drawing on experience and common sense, a judge may see opportunities for compromise not apparent to the parties and guide their negotiations toward solutions they might not otherwise have discovered. In some instances, one side may not want the litigation resolved by settle - ment, even on favorable terms, preferring to have their “day in court”; indeed, some cases involve important questions of law or public policy that are best re - solved by public, official adjudication. Sometimes, however, resistance to settle - ment arises instead from unreasonable or unrealistic attitudes. The judge can help influence counsel or the parties to reexamine their premises and assessments. Important as is the judge’s role as a catalyst for settlement, it must not be permitted to interfere with the steady progress of the case toward trial. Settlement efforts should not be permitted to delay or divert the pretrial process. Both can and should operate effectively on parallel tracks. 459 . See Litigation Manual, supra note 5, at 36–39."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Settlement 167 Nor should settlement efforts be permitted to impair the parties’ perception of the assigned judge’s fairness and impartiality. Some judges are able to partici - pate actively in settlement discussion as well as pretrial activity and trial if neces - sary. Occasionally, the parties request the assigned judge’s direct participation, waiving the right to seek recusal. 460 There is a danger, however, that such in - volvement will affect the parties’ confidence in the judge’s ability to try the case impartially. For this reason, many judges prefer not to engage in substantive set - tlement negotiations in cases they are expected to try, particularly if there is to be a bench trial, 461 instead bringing in another judge or other neutral person for that purpose. In some large litigation, the parties will be willing to pay for the services of a skilled mediator. See infra section 23.15. If the judge participates in settlement negotiations, patience and a willingness to listen are essential. Settlement negotiations in complex litigation are not a sport for the short-winded. An obstacle may be removed only to reveal another; the judge should not become, or allow counsel and the parties to become, dis - couraged. By careful attention, the judge may spot openings and opportunities not readily apparent. To retain room to maneuver, parties may signal their expec - tations and limits in subtle ways. Often their true objectives remain hidden from all but the most attentive listener. An observant judge can open channels for ef - fective communication. 23.12 Timing/Relationship to Discovery The subject of settlement should be broached at the initial scheduling confer- ence. 462 Counsel should prepare by discussing the possibility of settlement during the Rule 26(f) conference, as the rule requires, and becoming informed of their clients’ positions. Though the parties may lack sufficient information to be gin serious discussions, the judge should use the conference to explore the prospects for settlement, as well as the possibility of reference to extrajudicial procedures (see infra section 23.15). The judge may be able to schedule negotia tions and periodic progress reports and assist counsel in developing a format for them. 463 Counsel should be required to attend settlement conferences with full settlement authority or with immediate access to their client. 464 Any impending or finalized settlement should be disclosed to the court promptly (see also infra section 23.23). If negotiations founder, the judge may play a vital role in encour - 460 . See id. at 36. 461 . See D.

Settlement should be on the agenda of every conference, particularly the final pretrial conference. Although settlement should be explored early in the case, when the uncer - tainties of litigation and the potential savings of time, effort, and money are the greatest, the parties may be unwilling or unable to settle until they have more in - formation. While some discovery may therefore be needed, the benefits of settle - ment are diminished if it is put off until discovery has been completed. The judge should instead work with the parties to identify and narrow issues, and then tar - get early discovery at information needed for settlement negotiations. 465 Ordinarily, the court should not stay discovery or other pretrial proceedings based on the pendency of settlement discussions. Maintaining the momentum of the litigation and keeping trial preparation on schedule can create a powerful im - petus for settlement. Once the parties are close to agreement, however, if a par - ticular activity or deadline could affect their positions a short extension, moni - tored by the court, may be warranted. Avoiding the expense of imminent discov - ery can be an inducement to settle, but a settlement precluding or limiting further discovery should not be allowed to interfere with discovery needed by other par - ties (see infra section 23.22). 23.13 Specific Techniques to Promote Settlement A number of techniques have proven successful in promoting settlement. The list below is not intended to be exhaustive; creativity in this aspect of the litigation process has few risks and should be encouraged. Among the techniques that have been productive are the following: • Firm trial date. Setting a firm trial date is generally the most effective means to motivate parties to settle. To keep the date credible, the court must ensure that the case proceeds on schedule through pretrial; early settlement discussions should therefore generally not be allowed to delay pretrial proceedings. • Reference to another judge or magistrate judge. To avoid the appearance of partiality, the assigned judge may refer the parties to another judge or magistrate judge in the court to conduct settlement negotiations. Many courts have reciprocal arrangements by which judges assist in settlement negotiations in cases assigned to other judges. Generally, the settlement judge will be expected to maintain the confidentiality of the discussions with the parties. 465 . Targeted discovery is discussed in supra § 21.422."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Settlement 169 • Participation by parties. The court may request or require that the par - ties attend settlement conferences. 466 Participation by parties or their representatives may expedite negotiations, avoiding the delays involved in seeking authority. In any event, the attending parties will become bet - ter informed of the strengths and weaknesses of each side’s case and the costs and risks of pursuing the litigation. The parties’ presence may, how - ever, inhibit frank discussion by counsel, who may feel obliged to keep up appearances for the benefit of their clients. • Confidential discussions with judge. Meeting with each party (or side) separately for confidential discussions, with their mutual consent, may help the judge find common ground. The parties may be more willing to speak candidly outside of the adversarial setting, and the judge can point out weaknesses without fear of compromising a party’s position in the eyes of opposing counsel. After such discussions, the judge may be able to suggest areas of possible agreement, without revealing confidences. The court may also ask counsel to submit confidential memoranda outlining their settlement posture. • Settlement counsel, special masters, or experts. Despite their familiarity with the case, the attorneys conducting the litigation may not be those best suited to conduct settlement discussions. They are generally selected for their ability as litigators, while others may possess superior negotia - tion skills. They may also be hampered by personal antagonisms devel - oped in the course of the litigation. The judge may therefore suggest that one or more of the parties engage special counsel for the purpose of con - ducting settlement negotiations, or designate settlement counsel separate from lead and liaison counsel (see supra section 20.222). Judges have also used special masters to assist in settlement of complex litigation and in post-settlement claims-resolution proceedings. Arrangements for com - pensation of the special master must be made with the agreement of the parties, and selection should be made from a list provided by them (see supra section 21.52). • Contribution bar orders. To facilitate partial settlements in multiparty cases, the court may (unless prohibited by the underlying statute) ap - prove as a term of the settlement an order barring claims for contribution or indemnification by nonsettling defendants. To ensure binding effect, the parties affected (or those representing their interests) should be be - 466 . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c) (court may require party or its representative to be present or available by telephone)."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"170 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third fore the court, and their rights should be protected. 467 Courts generally require that the order contain a formula for calculating a setoff for non - settling defendants based on the settlement amount or the settlors’ ad - judged proportion of fault. 468 • Offer of judgment. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 68, a party defending against a claim may serve an offer of judgment upon the adverse party at any time more than ten days before trial (or proceedings to determine damages, if liability has already been adjudged). The party served has ten days to ac - cept. If it does not, it will be liable for all costs incurred after the offer was made unless it obtains a more favorable judgment. 469 Invoking this procedure can create an added incentive to accept a reasonable offer in litigation (such as antitrust) where taxable costs may be high, particularly where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorneys’ fees. 470 • Representative case(s). The results of a trial of one or a few representative lead cases can provide information and motivation helpful to settlement of related cases. • Severance. The early resolution of one or more issues by separate trial may provide a basis for settlement of others. The resolution of liability, damage, or other pivotal issues can provide the parties with the informa - tion or incentive needed for a comprehensive settlement. 471 467 .

The Federal Rules require court approval of settlements in class actions (including actions brought by or against an unincorporated associa - tion as a class), 473 shareholder derivative actions, 474 and actions in which a re - ceiver has been appointed. 475 The antitrust laws require court approval of con sent judgments proposed by the United States in actions it has instituted. 476 Common law may call for review and approval in a variety of contexts where the settlement requires court action, particularly if it affects the rights of nonparties or nonsettling parties, 477 or where the settlement is executed by a party acting in a representative capacity. 478 Although the standards and procedures for review and approval of settle - ments vary, in general the court is required to scrutinize the proposed settlement to ensure that it is fair to the persons whose interests the court is to protect. Those affected may be entitled to notice 479 and an opportunity to be heard. 480 This usually involves a two-stage procedure. First, the court reviews the proposal pre - liminarily to determine whether it is sufficient to warrant public notice and a hearing. If so, the final decision on approval is made after the hearing. The court must be given enough information to be able to fully and fairly consider the proposed settlement. All terms must be disclosed to enable the court to understand its effect on those not party to the settlement, and to prevent col - lusion and favoritism. 481 The court needs to be sensitive to the possibility that 472 .

The proponents should explain why the proposed settlement is preferable, for those not party to it, to continuation of the litigation, and should respond to objections they may raise. When settlement is proposed early in the litigation, before the court has become knowledgeable about the case, the court should ask for whatever additional information is neces - sary for its review. The judge must guard against the temptation to become an advocate—either in favor of the settlement because of a desire to conclude the litigation, or against the settlement because of the responsibility to protect the rights of those not party to it. Neither the proponents of the settlement nor those who are opposed or ab - sent should be favored. The court should be open to hearing the views of those who may be affected by the settlement, whether or not they have legal standing to be heard. Notice to absent parties may be advisable even if not required by gov - erning law. In some cases, the court may appoint an expert under Fed. R. Evid. 706 to provide a neutral assessment, 482 or special counsel to represent the inter ests of persons who are absent or under a legal disability. The trial court may not rewrite a settlement agreement; if it is unacceptable, the court must disapprove it. 483 The proponents may revise their agreement to overcome the court’s objections and resubmit it; if the changes are substantial, it may be necessary to begin the notice and review process anew. An order approv - ing a settlement should be supported by a statement of the court’s reasoning, to create a record for appellate review. 484 23.15 Alternative Processes to Encourage Settlement .151 Mediation 173 .152 Summary Jury Trial 175 .153 Minitrial 176 A number of processes outside of the traditional litigation process have proved effective in helping parties reach settlement.

The mediator may be an out - side attorney or retired judge selected by the judge or the parties, an expert in some relevant discipline, or another judge or magistrate judge. 489 Several na tional nonprofit organizations, including the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution, Inc., and the American Arbitration Association, as well as several for-profit enterprises, maintain panels of experienced lawyers, law professors, and retired judges available to serve as mediators or other ADR neutrals in complex dis putes. In addition, a number of district courts maintain court-based ADR programs that provide rosters of court-certified neutrals and guidelines for conduct ing the mediation process. Mediators should be experienced in federal litigation and should possess communication and negotiation skills; training in mediation skills is available, and it is desirable that a mediator selected for complex litigation has either been trained or has had relevant experience. The mediator helps the parties communicate not only their positions but also their underlying interests and concerns. The mediation process is seen as interest - based as opposed to rights-based arbitration. By helping the parties understand each other’s true interests and objectives, the mediator helps counsel and their clients devise mutually acceptable options for resolving their dispute. Mediators may also facilitate more traditional forms of settlement, by applying their experi - ence to probe each side’s position and suggest a fair valuation of the case. To en - 485 .

Outside persons who preside over ADR proceedings are called “neutrals”; if they assist the parties in negotiations, they may be called “facilitators.” See Deskbook, supra note 485, at 31. 489 . Some courts maintain panels of mediators who usually work on a volunteer basis or may sometimes be compensated from public funds.

Though mediation is generally ineffective if the parties are not mo - tivated to participate in good faith, a court order makes it possible for them to participate without appearing to show weakness. Opinions differ about the types of cases suitable for mediation; some believe it appropriate for simpler cases only, while others support its use in complex liti - gation. While in complex litigation, the judge must determine suitability on a case-by-case basis, the following factors generally indicate suitability: • trial will be to the court and referral will avoid judicial involvement in settlement discussions; • creative, nontraditional solutions are needed; • the parties have an interest in maintaining an ongoing relationship; • public policy or public interest considerations are minor; 491 and • the dispute is caused or exacerbated by poor communication among the parties. 492 Some judges initiate mediation after substantially all discovery has been completed (sometimes not until at or after the final pretrial conference), on the theory that the parties need the information acquired during discovery to discuss settlement intelligently. Others have had success initiating it earlier, before the parties’ positions have hardened and substantial costs have been incurred; this may be particularly appropriate for cases that appear to require nontraditional resolution. If the parties need certain information or legal rulings before entering mediation, the judge can order targeted discovery and promptly resolve the nec - essary motions. Mediation is relatively inexpensive, has had a high rate of success, and has met with substantial litigant satisfaction. If should not be used, however, simply to add a layer to the pretrial process, increasing cost and delay. Before making a referral to mediation, the court should take into account the suitability of the dis - pute, the parties’ attitudes, the likelihood of settlement, and the availability of a suitable mediator. Once a matter is referred to mediation, the judge should not interfere with the process but may set a time limit. 490 . If the court has rules for a local mediation program, they may affect the conduct of the mediation, for example, with respect to confidentiality; parties should become familiar with such rules (for a sample, see Deskbook, supra note 485, at 69–82) or ask the court to establish ground rules for the particular mediation. 491 .

A jury is chosen from the court’s regular pool, after abbreviated voir dire. 494 A judge or magistrate judge presides. Counsel are allotted a fixed time, generally one to a few hours, to make an abbreviated presentation of their case to the jury, including opening and closing statements as well as evidence. While most SJTs take one to two days, in complex multiparty cases they have been known to take up to two weeks. The type of evidence allowed must be determined by the court in light of the time constraints and is generally limited by the rules of evidence, though they may be relaxed. As with trial and other hearings, objections to admissibility should be made and resolved in advance. The court may also re - quire advance submission of proposed questions for voir dire, jury instructions, and, where relatively extensive presentations are anticipated, lists of exhibits and witnesses. To keep the procedure streamlined, counsel usually summarize pro - posed witnesses’ testimony rather than calling them. After brief instructions, the jurors deliberate for a short period of time and return a consensus verdict or, if unable to agree, individual verdicts. The jury may be asked to answer interroga - tories as well, to provide the parties with more specific information. In some courts, the judge and counsel may question the jurors after they deliberate, to delve further into their evaluation of the case. Settlement discussions may be conducted before, during, and after the hearing phase; negotiations may com - mence as soon as the advisory verdict is returned, or there may be a “cooling-off” period of several days or weeks. If no settlement can be reached, the case is tried as originally scheduled, before different jurors. SJTs can encourage settlement by (1) suggesting the probable outcome of a trial; (2) giving clients their “day in court” (albeit abbreviated); (3) exposing clients to the opposing side’s evidence; (4) highlighting the expense and uncer - tainty of a jury trial, and, perhaps most importantly; (5) placing a specific (and credible) dollar amount on the table. Client participation is necessary to accom - plish many of these ends; executives or other principals authorized to settle therefore must attend the SJT. Since they require a trial-ready case, SJTs are generally held after discovery. Unlike mediation, SJTs consume significant resources and should therefore be limited to litigation in which: • the trial will be lengthy and the potential savings substantial; 493 .

One circuit has held that the court may close an SJT to the press and public, reasoning that it is more like a settlement conference than a trial, and that pub - licity might interfere with settlement. 497 23.153 Minitrial A minitrial, like an SJT, involves summary presentations of each side’s case fol - lowed by settlement negotiations. Unlike an SJT, however, the parties present their cases directly to a panel of authorized client representatives, usually senior executives. Though a judicial officer or outside neutral presides, the objective is not to produce an advisory opinion but to launch meaningful settlement nego - tiations. The parties may, however, ask the presiding neutral to deliver an opinion or act as facilitator in subsequent negotiations. Witnesses are usually not called and the rules of evidence are relaxed; objections may be entirely prohibited. 498 The minitrial itself should take only one or two days, though settlement discus - sions may take longer. Usually, minitrials are arranged and conducted privately, sometimes even before litigation has commenced, but some federal judges have taken an active role in arranging or officiating at “court minitrials.” 499 In either case, the process is flexible enough to allow numerous variations in form (nomenclature varies as well; one judge calls minitrials “conditional summary trials,” while the Western District of Michigan uses the term “mini-hearings”). 495 .

Such partial settlements may provide funds needed to pursue the litigation, limit the extent of exposure, reduce the scope of discovery or trial, aid the parties in obtaining evidence, and facilitate later settlements on other issues and with other parties. On the other hand, partial settlements can, because of their timing or terms, interfere with the ultimate resolution of the liti - gation. A partial settlement on terms that prove too generous, for example, may create resistance to later, more reasonable settlement offers. To avoid such prob - lems, settling parties may adopt a general formula for all settlements; if adhered to, this may discourage adverse parties from prolonging litigation to get better terms. Late partial settlements in multiparty cases present a number of potential problems. 504 Attorneys with assigned responsibilities at trial may drop out when 500 .

While it is a common and legitimate litigation strategy to settle with one adverse party to weaken another’s position, when done on the eve of trial it may seriously disrupt the progress of the case. While both the power to shift costs for such conduct and the desirability of doing so are unclear, the judge can discourage belated and potentially disruptive settlements; if necessary to reduce the prejudice to nonsettling parties, the judge can grant a continuance. Moreover, lead counsel, members of a trial team, and other attorneys who have accepted responsibilities on behalf of other parties and attorneys should bear in mind that their fiduciary obligations may survive the dismissal of their own clients. Partial settlements can affect the issues and parties not covered. A partial set - tlement may (by law) release certain nonsettling parties or entitle them to a setoff for amounts received in settlement from coparties; in some areas of law, this may depend on the settling parties’ intention. 505 The agreement must therefore indi - cate clearly the parties and claims it is intended to cover, making plain the rela - tionship between the damage items covered and those that may later be awarded by judgment. The court needs to consider whether and in what manner payments made under the settlement agreement will be treated as offsets against future awards, 506 and how the settlement will be treated at trial. The parties may attempt to apportion the settlement among different claims, sometimes for tax purposes 507 and sometimes to enhance their position against nonsettling parties. When partial settlements are submitted for judicial approval, apportionment clauses need to be examined for their effect on further proceed - ings and other parties. The court should not approve an agreement that does not permit appropriate modification of such clauses if justified by later developments. Evidence of the settlement of a claim is inadmissible at trial “to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount,” though not for other purposes. 508 There is disagreement over whether this rule prohibits the introduction of evi - dence of a partial settlement for the purpose of allowing the jury, in determining damages, to consider the amount already recovered from other sources. 509 As an 505 .

Settlement agreements may therefore contain provisions purporting to relieve a settling party from further discovery, at least in part. Such agreements may be problematic if other parties need discovery from a settling party, particu - larly in light of the limits on nonparty discovery. They should therefore be drafted so as to take other parties’ continuing need for discovery into account. 512 A settlement agreement may also purport to require a party not to disclose its terms, or to return, destroy, or keep confidential discovery materials previously obtained. 513 The effect, if not the purpose, of such an agreement may be to forestall or frustrate other litigation, pending or anticipated. For this and other public policy reasons, including the protection of First Amendment interests, and under state law, such agreements may be invalid, unenforceable, or simply not entitled to approval. Where such an agreement may be appropriate (e.g., to pro - tect trade secrets), the court should consider requiring that the materials be pre - served for a reasonable period of time. The relevant analysis is similar to that employed when considering issuance of a protective order (see supra section 21.43). 23.23 Side Agreements Agreements allocating financial responsibility among persons or entities are common; contracts of insurance and indemnification are prime examples. Occasionally, however, litigants enter into side agreements apportioning damages that supplement their formal settlement agreements but are not intended to be disclosed to others. These agreements may not of themselves be unlawful or un - McHann v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 713 F.2d 161, 166 n.10 (5th Cir. 1983).

In presenting settlement agreements for judicial approval, how - ever, the parties are obliged to make full disclosure to the court of all terms and understandings, including any side agreements. The settling parties may request that certain terms not be disclosed to other parties, but must justify this to the court. 514 Common types of side agreements include the following: • “Mary Carter” agreements. In return for a settlement payment, the plaintiff may agree to release a particular defendant from liability though the defendant remains party to the suit, with the further provision that the defendant will be reimbursed in some specified manner out of any re - covery against other defendants. 515 Many varieties of such agreements have developed, including loan-receipt agreements and agreements to dismiss during the case or not to execute on a judgment if the defendant does not take an aggressive posture against the plaintiff’s claims. 516 This type of agreement, which derives its name from Booth v. Mary Carter Paint Co. , 517 has been criticized as unfair to nonsettling defendants, 518 since it has the effect of aligning the interests of the “settling” defendant, who remains in the litigation, with those of the plaintiff (usually covertly), eliminating their normal adversarial relationship. 519 Nevertheless, courts have rarely rejected a settlement on this basis, 520 though it has been suggested that they should give such agreements par - ticular scrutiny. 521 The primary problem raised by “Mary Carter” agreements is disclo - sure. Typically, parties entering into such an agreement do so secretly, or they request that the court not disclose the terms of the agreement. Nondisclosure, however, magnifies the prejudice to other parties, since neither the jury nor the defense can take the agreement into account when considering the testimony of the settling defendant; it may there - 514 .

Defendants sometimes agree in advance to allocate responsibility for damages among themselves according to an agreed formula (often based on market share). These agreements serve the legit - imate purposes of controlling parties’ exposure and preventing plaintiffs from forcing an unfair settlement by threats to show favoritism in the collection of any judgment that may be recovered. They may, however, expressly prohibit or indirectly discourage individual settlements. They also create a disincentive for defendants to make available evidence indi - cating liability on the part of codefendants. Therefore, while they are generally appropriate, the court may refuse to approve or enforce such agreements where they would violate public policy or prejudice other parties in these or other ways. 524 Sharing agreements should be discoverable. Once the agreement is made known, it may be possible to structure partial settlements to take its terms into account. It is less clear when and whether they should be ad - missible in evidence. Since Fed. R. Evid. 408 does not require exclusion of settlement agreements when offered for purposes such as proving bias, they may be admitted to attack a witness’s credibility or demonstrate that formally opposing parties are not in fact adverse, accompanied by a limit - ing instruction that the agreement is not to be considered as proof or dis - proof of liability or damages. 525 The court should not allow them to be admitted, however, when they are of little relevance and may be prejudi - cial 526 (e.g., by suggesting a conspiracy to the jury). • “Most-favored nation” clauses. Settlement agreements proposed early in the litigation often contain a “most-favored nation” clause, intended to encourage early settlement by protecting parties against being prejudiced by later, more favorable settlements with others.

Such clauses have several drawbacks: (1) the potential liability under them is indeterminate, making them risky; (2) the additional recovery they may produce for some plaintiffs without any effort by their attorneys makes fees difficult to fix; and (3) the factors that induce parties to settle with different parties for different amounts, such as the time of settle - ment and the relative strength of claims, are nullified. Such clauses can provide an incentive for early settlement as well as an obstacle to later settlements. To limit their prejudicial impact, such clauses should termi - nate after a specified length of time (to prevent one or more holdouts from delaying final implementation), impose ceilings on payments, and allow flexibility to deal with changed circumstances or with parties financially unable to contribute proportionately. 527 The court may have to consider voiding or limiting them if enforcement becomes in- equitable. 528 • Tolling agreements. Parties may enter into agreements under which one side promises not to assert a statute of limitations defense in return for some consideration. These should generally be disclosed to the court and other parties to avoid disruption of the case-management plan and frus - tration of the goals of court-imposed deadlines. 23.24 Ethical Considerations Settlement discussions and agreements can raise a number of ethical issues even if not kept secret: • Communications with represented parties. Attorneys may not commu - nicate directly with a party represented by counsel (absent that counsel’s presence or consent). 529 This rule prohibits attorneys from directly ne- 527 .

Pa. 1985), aff’d mem. 791 F.2d 917 (3d Cir. 1986). 528 . If this determination involves disputed questions of fact, the court may have to hold an evidentiary hearing, possibly allowing additional discovery.

Defendants have at - tempted to condition settlement on an agreement that plaintiff’s counsel will not represent other persons with similar claims, but it is an ethical violation for an attorney to enter into or propose such an agreement. 532 A variation, also ethically dubious, is so-called “futures deals,” in which the settling attorney agrees to process similar claims of future clients ac - cording to the settlement terms, or to advise clients to accept those terms. • Negotiations regarding attorneys’ fees. In routine nonclass litigation, in which each party is responsible for its own attorneys’ fees, settling defen - dants customarily pay a negotiated sum, leaving counsel and their clients to settle their fees. Problems may arise, however, in cases where the court must approve settlements containing provisions for attorneys’ fees, as in class actions (see infra section 30.24) or in cases, such as civil rights ac - tions, in which the losing side is liable for the adversary’s attorneys’ fees. One issue is whether settlement negotiations involving attorneys’ fees may or should be conducted simultaneously with negotiations on the merits. When a defendant offers to settle for a lump sum covering both damages and fees, negotiating the allocation may create a conflict of in - terest for the plaintiff’s attorney. 533 The problem is acute when the plaintiffs are represented by legal aid or another nonprofit group that has agreed with the clients to seek fees only from the opposing parties. 534 The Supreme Court, while recognizing that “such situations may raise difficult ethical issues for a plaintiff’s attorney,” has declined to prohibit this practice, reasoning that “a defendant may have good reason to de - mand to know his total liability.” 535 Indeed, the Court has stated that settlement of civil rights cases would be impeded by rules prohibiting si - 530 . See, e.g., Walker v. Kotzen, 567 F. Supp. 424, 426–27 (E.D. Pa. 1983), appeal dismissed , 734 F.2d 9 (3d Cir. 1984). For settlement and related communications in class actions, see infra §§ 30.2, 30.4. 531 .

A further problem may be presented if a defendant conditions a settle - ment favorable to plaintiffs on an agreement to waive attorneys’ fees, particularly if the relief sought is primarily or entirely nonmonetary. Plaintiffs’ attorney, having an ethical obligation to obtain the most favor - able relief for the client without regard to the attorney’s interest in a fee, may thereby be coerced into giving up all fees. 538 This in turn may dis - courage other attorneys from representing civil rights claimants. 539 Some bar associations have ruled it unethical for defendants to request fee waivers in exchange for relief on the merits. 540 The Court, however, has approved the practice, reasoning that a prohibition on fee waivers would discourage settlement, since, because of the “potentially large and typically uncertain magnitude” of fee awards, defendants are unlikely to settle until the issue of fees has been resolved. 541 The court is therefore free to approve such settlements, 542 though counsel may be prohibited by state rules from proposing them. 543 • Failure to submit offers to client. Attorneys have an obligation to promptly submit nonfrivolous offers of settlement to the client, unless prior discussions have made clear that the proposal will be unaccept - able. 544 Breach of this duty is egregious if counsel will be compensated in whole or in part on the basis of the number of hours expended in the litigation, as in the case of defense counsel or when fees are awarded or approved by the court on a lodestar basis. 536 .

The rules that govern the award of attorneys’ fees and expenses are not always clear and settled, and involve a large measure of discretion. 547 Moreover, because of the sums involved, the calculation of awards is often complex, burdensome, and bitterly contested, sometimes leading to satellite litigation.

The nature of the award will depend on the type of case and recovery and the governing rules in the jurisdiction. Appropriate management measures should be instituted early, depending on the nature of a party’s prospective entitlement, to avoid unnecessary controversy and litigation at later stages. The following are the principal types of cases and situations in which courts may award attorneys’ fees: • Common fund cases. If attorneys’ efforts preserve or create a fund or benefit for others in addition to their own clients, the court is empowered to award fees from the fund. 549 The award may be made from recover ies obtained by settlement or by trial. Common fund cases are predomi - nantly, though not exclusively, class actions, but some class actions may also be brought under fee-shifting statutes. 550 A variant on the traditional common fund case occurs frequently in mass tort litigation—both class actions and large consolidations—where a fund to pay attorneys’ fees is created as a part of a settlement and the court must distribute it among the various plaintiffs’ attorneys, including class counsel, court-designated lead and liaison counsel, and individual plaintiffs’ counsel. 551 • Statutory fees cases.

Various provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize the award of fees against parties who have failed to comply with rules or orders with respect to discovery and other pretrial proceedings.

Accordingly, it has been criticized by courts, commentators, and members of the bar. 567 Despite application by courts nationwide, the Supreme Court never formally adopted the lodestar method in a common fund case. In re - cent years, the trend has been toward the percentage of the fund method. 568 Courts applying the percentage method have generally awarded attorneys’ fees in a range from 25% to 30% of the fund. 569 Several courts have concluded that 25% should be a “benchmark” for such awards, subject to upward or down - ward adjustment depending on the circumstances of the case. 570 Where the fund is unusually large, however, the application of a benchmark percentage may result in a windfall to counsel. 571 Some courts have therefore used a sliding scale, with the percentage decreasing as the magnitude of the fund increased, 572 or have used the lodestar method. 573 565 . 540 F.2d 102 (3d Cir. 1976).

Use of the lodestar may be more appropriate than the percentage of the fund method where the fund is extraordinarily large. 581 As with percentage fees, an award of attorneys’ fees under the lodestar method should fairly compensate the attorney for the reasonable value of the services beneficially rendered, based on the circumstances of the particular case. 582 The lodestar method may also be appropriate for distributing attorneys’ fees out of a common fund created for that purpose, as in the case of a settlement of mass tort litigation. Such cases may require allocation of fees among different sets of plaintiffs’ lawyers, such as those designated by the court to serve on a steering committee (and entitled to compensation for that service) and those who only represent individual plaintiffs. Because compensation directed to the former will reduce the amount available to satisfy contingent fee arrangements, the court will need to resolve conflicts between these groups in determining a fair alloca tion. 583 The lodestar calculation begins with the multiplication of the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate. 584 The number of hours reasonably expended and the reasonable hourly rate must be supported by adequate records and other appropriate evidence.

This will vary according to the geographic area and the attorney’s experience, reputation, practice, qualifications, and customary charge, and is intended to en - compass the rate that the attorney would normally command in the relevant marketplace in which the services are offered. 587 The resulting lodestar figure may be adjusted, either upward or down ward, 588 to account for several factors including, inter alia , the quality of the representation, the benefit obtained for the class, the complexity and novelty of the issues presented, the risk of nonpayment, 589 and the delay in payment. 590 Use of current rather than historic hourly rates 591 or an award of interest 592 is permitted as an appropriate adjustment for delay in payment.

This decision will have a substantial effect on incentives in the litigation. At the commencement of the litigation, the court should also establish guidelines, ground rules, and procedures that will lighten the burdens on the participants, clarify expectations, and reduce the op - portunities for disputes. 607 This should be done at an early conference after consultation with counsel. Matters such as those discussed in the following para - graphs should be covered; although most of them are relevant primarily to the lodestar method, they may be helpful in making percentage awards as well. 24.211 Maintaining Adequate and Comprehensible Records When fees are awarded on a lodestar basis, maintaining careful and complete time records is critical; in other cases, it is at least advisable. In large litigation, however, these records may be so voluminous to be beyond the capacity of the judge to review and analyze. That problem should be addressed early in the case by developing means of record keeping that will facilitate judicial review. Records should be maintained currently (not constructed after the fact), disclosing the name of the attorney, the time spent on each discrete activity, and the nature of the work performed. In some large cases, clients require their attorneys to main - tain their time and charge records on computers using programs that facilitate analysis of billings and fee requests; such a program should be considered in large litigation. Such programs enable the reviewer to determine, for example, the total time spent on particular matters or activities and the time spent and activities pursued by individual lawyers. Agreed forms of summaries may be used to achieve similar results. 24.212 Submission of Periodic Reports Some judges require submission of periodic reports in anticipation of an award at the end of the litigation (to protect attorney work product, it may be necessary to submit some of the information under seal or in camera ). This practice encour - ages lawyers to maintain current records adequate for the court’s purposes and enables the court to spot developing problems, such as the expenditure of exces - sive time on the case or some aspects of it.

To discharge its responsibility in awarding reasonable fees, the court must concern itself with the reasonableness of the effort expended, as reflected in the staffing of the case. The court should consider set - ting at least presumptive guidelines at the outset of the litigation, after discussion with counsel. Setting such guidelines at the outset, to the extent possible and subject to revision as may later become necessary, can reduce the potential for later conflicts and disappointment, and can facilitate judicial review of fee appli - cations. Guidelines may address the number of attorneys for whom time spent at - tending depositions, court hearings, office and court conferences, and trial may be charged. They may also caution against having high-priced attorneys expend substantial time on projects suitable for less senior attorneys. Finally, they may set forth the range of hourly charges for particular attorneys on the case and permis - sible charges for travel time. In setting such guidelines, the court should take into account the need for a degree of symmetry between the staffing levels of plaintiffs and of defendants. 24.214 Compensation for Designated Counsel Lead and liaison counsel designated by the court will perform functions necessary for the management of the case but not appropriately charged to their clients or against the fee award. Early in the litigation, the court should define the functions designated counsel are to perform, determine the method of compensation, spec - ify the records to be kept, and establish the arrangements for their compensation, including setting up a fund to which all parties should contribute in specified proportions. Guidelines should cover staffing, hourly rates, and estimated charges for their services and expenses. 24.215 Reimbursement of Expenses Rules and practices vary widely with respect to reimbursement of expenses in - curred by lawyers in the course of the case out of a fee award. Charges for parale - gals and law clerks at market rates 608 and the fees of necessary experts are gen - erally reimbursable. Secretarial assistance, on the other hand, is a normal part of overhead, but courts have differed over whether overtime is reimbursable. Similarly, rulings vary on such items as copy and printing costs, certain meals and travel, and fax, telephone, and delivery charges. The determination of these kinds of claims should not be left to costly and time-consuming adversary adjudication at the end of the litigation; ground rules on reimbursement should be established at the outset. 608 .

If counsel expect to treat such items as reimbursable expenses (or taxable costs) at the conclusion of the case, they should advise the court and opposing counsel and obtain clearance before the expenses are incurred, and the court may fix ceilings for such expenses. This procedure should also be followed in cases in which the court does not award attorney fees. 24.22 Motion for Attorneys’ Fees .221 Contents of the Motion 197 .222 Timing 197 .223 Supporting Documentation and Evidence 198 .224 Discovery 198 24.221 Contents of the Motion Local rules that lay down the requirements that motions for fees must meet should be the primary source of guidance. If the court expects to depart, it should advise counsel early in the case so they can prepare and maintain records in ways that will facilitate the later preparation of the motion. The court will need to de - termine what materials in support of the motion should be filed concurrently and what materials may be submitted at or before a hearing. If the court elects to bi - furcate the determination of liability for fees from that of the amount, as it may under Rule 54(d)(2)(C), it should give timely notice to counsel to avoid unneces - sary work. Where multiple counsel in the case expect to submit separate motions, they should be required to coordinate their submissions, avoid duplication, and per - haps attempt to resolve disputes among themselves before submission. Lead counsel can be made responsible for overseeing this process. 24.222 Timing Rule 54(d)(2)(B) requires that motions for the award of attorneys’ fees be filed and served no later than fourteen days after entry of judgment unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court. Prompt filing of the motion enables the opponent, class members, and other interested parties to be informed of the claim before the time for appeal has expired, affords the court an opportunity to rule on the application while the services are still fresh in mind, and allows an ap - peal to be taken at the same time as an appeal on the merits."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third Although such motions are ordinarily made at the end of the case, an interim award of fees and expenses will sometimes be appropriate. 609 24.223 Supporting Documentation and Evidence To the extent not previously submitted with the motion, time and expense records must be submitted in manageable and comprehensible form, preferably in advance of any hearing to enable parties to prepare, to reach agreements where possible, and to streamline the hearing. The time records should reflect the time spent by each attorney and the nature of the work performed; where different claims were litigated, the records should identify the claims to which the particu - lar services relate. 610 In addition, the evidence on which counsel will rely in urging the application of particular rates for particular lawyers, or of a particular percentage when that method is to be used, should be submitted. The direct tes - timony of witnesses in support of the application can be submitted in the form of declarations, with the witnesses available at the hearing for cross-examination if requested. All agreements or understandings with clients and other attorneys regarding fees in the litigation must be submitted or disclosed. 611 24.224 Discovery Discovery in connection with fee motions should rarely be permitted. 612 If ap - propriate guidelines and ground rules have been established, the materials sub - mitted should normally meet the needs of the court and other parties. If a party requests clarification of material submitted in support of the motion, or addi - tional material, the court should determine what information is genuinely needed and arrange for its informal production. 609 .

Courts must conduct that process, bur - densome though it may be, in a manner that will discharge their obligation that fees awarded are reasonable and consistent with governing law. Following are several techniques judges have developed to expedite the review process: • Sampling. Some judges, using techniques employed by auditors, select certain blocks of time, at random or at the suggestion of a party, and ex - amine them closely to determine the reasonableness of the hours charged. The results of the sampling are then applied to the entire fee application by extrapolation. 613 • Evaluating the request in light of a budget submitted by counsel at the beginning of the case. Counsel would have to justify substantial depar - tures from the budget. • Using computer programs to facilitate analysis of fee requests. See supra section 24.211. • Establishing the fees to be earned or the formula on which they are to be awarded at the outset of the case in the order appointing counsel. The court should routinely specify, at the outset of the litigation, the method of compensation that will be used. Innovative methods used in this con - nection have included competitive bidding procedures for the selection of class counsel, 614 and appointment of an outside attorney to negotiate a fee arrangement for the class. 615 • Having defendants submit billing records. Where defendants oppose plaintiff’s counsel’s fee request, records showing defendants’ attorneys’ fees may provide a reference for determination of the level of reasonable fees. 613 . Evans v.

Before doing so, however, the judge should take all reasonable steps to simplify and streamline the process; magistrate judges are also heavily burdened, and retaining special masters or experts adds to the already substantial cost of litigation. 24.232 Hearing and Order Rule 54(d)(2)(C) requires the court, on request of a party or class member, to “afford an opportunity for adversary submissions with respect to [a] motion” for attorneys’ fees. An evidentiary hearing may be required in some cases where significant facts are in dispute, but subsection (D) permits the court to “establish special procedures by which issues relating to such fees may be resolved without extensive evidentiary hearings.” Where competing applications are made for fees payable from a common fund, due process may require that claimants be af - forded a meaningful opportunity to be heard. 617 When a hearing is anticipated, the court should hold a prehearing conference to narrow the issues and resolve as many disputes as possible. Techniques to expedite bench trials should be used, such as the advance exchange and submission of direct testimony, subject to cross-examination of the witness at the hearing when requested (see supra section 22.51). 618 Rule 54 (c)(2)(C) requires the court to “find the facts and state its conclu - sions of law as provided in Rule 52(a),” and to issue its judgment in a separate document under Rule 58.

In complex litigation with multiple appeals, such a conference is par - ticularly desirable and, if necessary, counsel should move for one on the filing of the notice of appeal. An early conference may simplify the appeal, allow coordi - nation with related appeals, and reduce the burdens on the court and counsel. The court may use it to establish coordinated briefing and hearing schedules in related appeals and petitions. Briefing of marginal issues and settled propositions may be avoided. The court may be willing to indicate the points that preliminarily appear to be most significant to it and on which counsel should focus their atten - tion in the briefs.

P. 58, the final judgment must be set forth on a separate doc - ument identified as such, and separate from any order, memorandum, or opin - ion; if the final judgment will run to several pages, a single cover sheet referring to and adopting the provisions set forth in an attached appendix may be prepared for signature. The judgment is effective only when entered by the clerk in accor - dance with Rule 79(a). 658 The time for appeal does not begin to run until both of these conditions have been met. 659 If a party timely files a motion under Rule 50(b) for judgment as a matter of law, under Rule 52(b) to amend or make addi - tional findings of fact, or under Rule 59 for a new trial or to amend the judgment, the time to appeal runs instead from entry of the order denying a new trial or 657 .

Most courts by local rule or order provide that, after the time for appeal has expired, the parties are permitted—if not directed—to remove many of the documents and other exhibits. Exhibits gathered or compiled at great expense in the case may, however, be needed by parties in other litigation, pending or not. In complex litigation, the court should therefore be hesitant to authorize immediate destruction of docu - ments and other exhibits.

Particularly because such litigation imposes unique responsibilities on the court, as well as on counsel, it calls for closer judicial oversight than other types of litigation. The potential for actions, by counsel or parties, that will deliberately or inadvertently result in prejudice to litigants is great.

This chapter addresses issues commonly arising in the course of the manage - ment of class actions. Although substantive and procedural rules are, to a degree, implicated in litigation management decisions, those rules are for the most part beyond the chapter’s scope. 662 The focus of this chapter is on the typical class action in which plaintiffs are seeking to be recognized as representatives of a plaintiff class. Occasionally a defendant class is sought to be certified or a request for class certification is made by an adversary rather than by the putative class representatives; the case-management principles discussed here are generally applicable to those and other variants, including derivative actions brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1. The organization of this chapter should not be permitted to obscure the fact that the various aspects of managing class action litigation are closely intertwined, and that following cross-references between sections will therefore frequently be helpful. 30.1 Certification .11 Timing 213 .12 Discovery 215 .13 Hearings 216 .14 Class Definition 217 .15 Multiple Cases and Classes/Subclasses 219 .16 Selection of Counsel and Representatives 221 .17 Classes for Special Issues 222 .18 Reconsideration 223 Whether a class is certified and how its membership is defined can often have a decisive effect not only on the outcome of the litigation but also on its manage - ment. It determines the stakes, the structure of trial and methods of proof, the scope and timing of discovery and motion practice, and the length and cost of the litigation. The decision on whether or not to certify a class, therefore, can be as important as decisions on the merits of the action and should be made only after consideration of all relevant evidence and arguments presented by the parties. 663 662 .

P. 23(c)(1) directs the court to determine “as soon as practicable” whether an action is to be maintained on behalf of or against a class (commonly called “certifying” the class, although Rule 23 does not use the term). Early certification or denial can be crucial, because it substantially affects such funda - mental matters as: • the structure and the stakes of the litigation; • who the parties are; • how discovery is conducted; • the procedure for motion practice; • the application of ADR procedures; and • the approach to settlement negotiations. Denial of class certification has the immediate effect of restarting the running of the statute of limitations against unnamed plaintiffs. 664 When an action has been filed as a class action, the court must treat it as one until it has determined otherwise. It should therefore take up the matter at the initial scheduling conference, calling on the attorneys to address the issues bear - ing on certification and establishing a schedule for ruling on the motion for class certification. While the presumption should be in favor of an early resolution, the appropriate timing will vary with the circumstances of the case. Some district courts have local rules that specify a short period—typically thirty to ninety days—within which the plaintiff must file its motion. 665 Such rules, though consistent with Rule 23 in calling for an early class action decision, may not allow sufficient time to develop an adequate record, particularly in complex cases. Requests for modifying such time periods should be made at the initial confer - ence or as soon thereafter as the need is known. Failure to comply with such a rule should not be treated as an absolute bar to certification, though it may be rel - evant to the determination of adequacy of representation under Rule 23(a)(4). 666 The court’s principal concern should be to develop a record adequate to en - able it to decide whether the prerequisites of Rule 23 have been met. While de - termining numerosity and adequacy of representation may be relatively simple, determining whether common questions exist and predominate and whether the 664 .

Of course, where a plaintiff’s claim is plainly idiosyncratic, or where, on the other hand, the action challenges the legality of a statute or regulation appli - cable to a definable class, the determination may be sufficiently clear as not to re - quire developing a record for decision. For the court to be able to decide issues of commonalty and typicality, it will generally need to have a clear understanding of the nature of the claims and defenses, and at least a general understanding of the relevant facts and applicable substantive law. Although the court should not at this stage assess the merits of the underlying claim(s), 667 these determinations cannot always be made on the bare allegations of the pleadings, and some discov - ery may be needed. 668 Moreover, in determining under Rule 23(b)(3) whether class action treatment “is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy,” the court should consider alternatives, such as consolidation, intervention, and the use of test cases. 669 The court may also need to consider whether to entertain motions to dismiss or for summary judgment pending class certification. Courts have been divided over whether an action may be dismissed on the merits before certification. The court should rarely postpone a ruling on subject-matter jurisdiction or jurisdic - tion of the parties. Similarly, defects in venue or service of process should ordi - narily be raised so that they may be timely corrected before the case is permitted to proceed. A precertification ruling on the merits, however, raises concerns. While it binds only the individual parties, 670 it may have precedential effect on the putative class members. When it is clear that the action lacks merit, dismissal will avoid unnecessary expense for the parties and burdens for the court, 671 but the court should consider whether the interests of putative class members may be prejudiced. 672 667 .

Courts occasionally have granted sum mary judgment in favor of a class representative before considering the question of class certification. This practice should usually be avoided. Post-judgment certification in favor of the class may not be possible.

Undesirable consequences may follow when an expansive class, formed on insufficient information, is later decertified or redefined. Substantial time and expense may be wasted on discov ery with respect to matters affecting persons who are later excluded. Those elimi - nated from the litigation as a result of decertification or reduction in the size of a class may be confused at best or prejudiced at worst. If relief is obtained for a re - duced class, those who were initially in the larger class may attempt to reverse the decision that excluded them from the class; such a reversal may be particularly troublesome if the relief was obtained by settlement. 30.12 Discovery Precertification discovery should be structured to facilitate an early certification decision while furthering efficient and economical discovery on the merits. The determination whether the prerequisites of Rules 23(a) and (b) are satisfied can generally be made on the pleadings and declarations, with relatively little need for discovery. To the extent discovery is needed prior to the certification hearing, it should be directed at the named parties; only upon a demonstration of need—for example, where persons are identified as having information relevant to certification issues—should discovery of putative class members be permit ted. 673 If discovery is needed, the court may want to (1) impose appropriate limitations on the number and scope of depositions and other discovery directed at class representatives, and (2) establish a limited time period within which to conduct specific class-related discovery. Bifurcating class and merits discovery can at times be more efficient and eco - nomical (particularly when the merits discovery would not be used if certification were denied), but can result in duplication and unnecessary disputes among counsel over the scope of discovery. To avoid this, the court should call for a specific discovery plan from the parties, identifying the depositions and other dis - covery contemplated and the subject matter to be covered.

When discovery is needed on the claims of one or more of the representative parties and the status of some of the members of the putative class, it should be directed at the named plaintiffs. Discovery from class members (see infra section 30.232) is susceptible to being used by parties opposing class certification as a device to harass and embarrass, and should be necessary only in unusual circum - stances. Precertification inquiries into the financial arrangements between the class representatives and their counsel respecting the expenses of the litigation are rarely appropriate, 675 particularly in view of the ethical rule permitting attor neys to “advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter,” 676 though these arrange ments may later become relevant in awarding fees. See supra section 24.12. Potential problems with class discovery should be addressed early in the liti - gation. At the initial conference in a case with class allegations, and as a part of planning the schedule for a certification ruling, the judge should inquire whether any discovery from the class is contemplated, either on Rule 23 issues or on the merits of the case, and should make appropriate provisions in the discovery plan. 30.13 Hearings The nature and scope of the dispute over class certification determines the kind of hearing to be held under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c). Although the rule does not specifically require a hearing, one will generally be desirable; some courts have held that a hearing is required before a denial of certification, 677 and one may also be necessary where the factual basis for a class action is challenged. 678 When the facts are not in dispute, oral argument will suffice.

When an evidentiary hearing on class certification is necessary, it should not be a minitrial to adjudicate the merits of the class or individual claims. 679 The court may, however, need a detailed explanation from the parties regarding these claims and how they will be presented and defended at a trial on the merits—not to assess the merits of the claims, but to project the type of trial that likely will take place if the case proceeds as a class action. To make the hearing more efficient, the court may limit the number of witnesses, require depositions to be summarized, call for the presentation of the direct evidence of witnesses by writ - ten statements, and use other techniques described in supra section 22.5 for non - jury trials. The judge should enter findings and conclusions after the hearing, addressing each of the applicable criteria of Rule 23. Failure to do so may result in reversal, while an order applying these criteria to the facts will generally be given broad deference. 680 Findings are particularly important if the decision rests on credi - bility assessments. 30.14 Class Definition Class definition is of critical importance because it identifies the persons (1) enti - tled to relief, (2) bound by a final judgment, and (3) entitled to notice in a Rule 23(b)(3) action. It is therefore necessary to arrive at a definition that is precise, objective, and presently ascertainable. For example, the class may be defined as consisting of those persons and companies (other than the defendants) that pur - chased specified products from the defendants and other specified sellers during a specified time period. Because of the notice requirement and the frequent neces - sity of having to deal with individual damage claims, greater precision is required in (b)(3) actions than in those brought under (b)(1) or (b)(2). 681 Definitions, particularly under (b)(3), should avoid criteria that are subjective (e.g., a plain - tiff’s state of mind) or that depend on the merits (e.g., persons who were discrim - inated against).

The judge should consider whether the definition will serve the purpose for which the class is certified (i.e., the resolution of common questions of fact and law in a single proceeding). The definition should not, therefore, exclude a substantial number of persons with claims similar to those of persons included in the class. The appropriate scope of a class may also be affected by the applicable substantive law and choice-of-law considerations, which may, among other things, require subclasses. 683 The definition may be qualified by adding appropriate language describing the claims made on behalf of the class in the litigation, such as allegations of de - nial of employment on account of race. 684 The class representatives and all members of the class must, however, meet the commonalty and typicality re - quirements of Rule 23(a), even in cases based on claims of class discrimina tion. 685 These considerations may make it appropriate for the judge to consider whether class action treatment of the particular litigation would be “superior” to consolidation. 686 A class may be defined to include future members, but in the case of a Rule 23(b)(3) class, membership should ordinarily be ascertainable as of the time of judgment. There is no need to ascertain individual members in (b)(2) class ac - tions for injunctive relief. 687 When an action is certified as a class action under Rule 23(c)(4) with respect to a particular issue only, the class may be defined in ways that would not otherwise be appropriate if it were certified for all purposes.

There may be several cases with similar class allegations, each of which might be appropriately certified under Rule 23. These various possibilities are, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(B), to be considered in deciding whether to certify a (b)(3) action. Competing claims for certification may be pressed by different class representatives and their attorneys. 690 Rarely should more than one be certified, although under appropriate circumstances subclasses may be consid - ered, as discussed below. The designation of several persons as representatives of the class is, however, often desirable to make plaintiffs more representative of the diverse interests involved; if not already parties, the additional representatives may sometimes be added to the action by joinder, intervention, or filing a consol - idated complaint. In the interest of manageability, however, rarely should more than ten persons or firms be named as class representatives. At times, counsel re - quest certification of multiple classes and subclasses to gain appointment to posi - tions of leadership in conducting the litigation (see infra section 30.16). Creation of unnecessary classes and subclasses to accommodate an excessive number of at - torneys in the litigation leads to confusion, conflict, and excessive attorneys’ fees and should be avoided. In deciding which of several related cases to certify as a class action—assum - ing that each meets the requirements of Rule 23—the court has broad discretion. A number of factors are relevant. Under Rule 23(b)(3)(B), the court is to consider the pendency of other litigation concerning the controversy, in both state and federal courts, by or against members of the class. 691 If the cases were trans ferred to the court after having been initially filed in different districts, there may be choice-of-law consequences. The court should consider whether persons who are class members under the allegations of one complaint are also members under those of another. Certifying an earlier case may avoid statute of limitations prob - lems that cannot be cured by amendment of the second complaint. In such cir - 688 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). 689 . A court is not precluded from defining a class under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2) to include only those putative class members who do not opt out of the litigation. Such a definition may be appropriate in some (b)(2) cases or in a (b)(1)(B) case in which the class was formed merely be cause separate actions by class members might impede their ability to protect their interests.

Some cases may have impediments to the granting of full relief, such as the failure or inability to join or serve all defendants, or the limited scope of the allegations in the complaint. In addition, the court should consider the quality of representa - tion offered by competing counsel and class representatives (see infra section 30.16). During certification proceedings—or even after a class has been certified — the court may discover differences in the positions of class members, differences that may cause conflicts in the conduct of the litigation or in settlement. Although all members of the class may challenge the same conduct of the defen - dants, class members’ specific interests and legal theories may be different, 692 or the relief sought by some may be inconsistent with or competitive with that sought by others, even though they have a common position on liability. While the existence of conflicting interests does not alone preclude class certification, it may have a bearing on whether the class meets the prerequisites of Rule 23, in particular the requirements of adequacy of representation and the predominance of common questions. To avoid such problems, the court may define the issues or the controlling theories of recovery—such as those governing damages—so as to avoid or minimize conflicts. 693 The court may also certify more than one class or split a class into subclasses. 694 Each class or subclass must independently satisfy the prerequisites of Rules 23(a) and (b). 695 If too many subclasses are sought, some may not contain enough members to satisfy the numerosity requirement. 696 Federal class actions may encompass plaintiffs who are also parties to indi - vidual or class actions pending in state court. The existence of parallel state court actions does not preclude certification but should be taken into account in arriv - ing at a definition of the class. Because a prior resolution of the federal action may have a preclusive effect on claims pending in state courts, it is important at least 692 . Different state laws may, for example, govern the claims of class members residing in different states. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797 (1985). 693 . See Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891 (9th Cir. 1975). 694 . See, e.g., Monarch Asphalt Sales Co. v. Wilshire Oil Co., 511 F.2d 1073 (10th Cir. 1975); Wellman v.

See infra section 30.3. 30.16 Selection of Counsel and Representatives In the selection of a class to be certified or the selection of lead counsel from among those representing different individuals or groups of plaintiffs making up the certified class, the court will often be faced with having to select both counsel for the class and the class representative. The court has wide discretion in making these selections. It is not limited to those who are appearing for the class represen tatives; if necessary to ensure adequacy of representation, the court may appoint different attorneys as class counsel or may condition class certification on the employment of other or additional counsel (see supra section 20.22). The relative competence, experience, dedication, reliability, and resources of the attorneys who appear on behalf of the different persons seeking to become class representatives are important factors. Attorneys often engage in lively com - petition for the appointment, and to reach an informed decision the court may require them to make a substantial showing. An important element in the selec - tion process is economy; the court should scrutinize the way in which attorneys propose to bill and the amounts of fees or percentages of the recovery they intend to collect. The court may lay down conditions for appointment designed to con - trol the costs and fees of the litigation—some courts have called for competitive bidding. 698 The selection of the class representatives is perhaps less critical, depending on the nature of the case; in certain types of fact-intensive cases, such as employment discrimination cases, the representatives should be knowledgeable. In any case, the representatives must be free of conflicts. The court should ensure that they understand their responsibility to remain free of conflicts and to “vigorously pur - sue” the litigation in the interests of the class, 699 including subjecting them selves to discovery. Later replacement of a class representative may become neces sary when, for example, the representative’s individual claim has been mooted or otherwise significantly affected by intervening events, such as decertification, or 697 . But note that a federal non-opt-out Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2) class has the practical effect of an injunction against the state court proceeding.

Formal inter - vention by class members is usually unnecessary and inadvisable. Class members in Rule 23(b)(3) actions may, however, appear by their own attorneys, subject to the court’s power to adopt appropriate controls regarding the organization of counsel. If no appropriate substitute is immediately available, notice may be given to the class under Rule 23(d)(2), inviting intervention as a named party. The no - tice may provide that, unless a new party seeks by a specified date to intervene to represent the class, the class will be decertified. Because of the potential prejudice to class members, it is important that the notice adequately inform them of the anticipated action and allow sufficient time for a response. 701 To protect the interests of the class, class counsel should make reasonable efforts to recruit a new representative. 30.17 Classes for Special Issues Under Rule 23(c)(4)(A), “an action may be brought or maintained as a class ac - tion with respect to particular issues.” Thus, a class may be certified for only cer - tain issues or claims in the litigation. 702 Selectively used, this provision enables a court to achieve the economies of class action treatment for portions of a case, the balance of which may either not qualify under the rule or be unmanageable as a class action. The court may, moreover, certify a (b)(3) class for certain claims, allowing class members to opt out, while creating a (b)(1) or (b)(2) class for other claims, from which opt outs may not be permitted. The provision authorizing a class for specific common “issues” does not re - quire that an entire claim by or against a class be certified. Although so far little used, several courts have assumed that (c)(4) authorizes class certification of one or more issues relating to liability while certification of other issues affecting lia - bility or damages is denied or deferred. 703 In considering such an approach, the 700 .

Once such an order is issued, the parties can be expected to rely on it and conduct discovery, prepare for trial, and engage in settlement dis - cussions on the assumption that in the normal course of events it will not be al - tered except for good cause. Sometimes, however, developments in the litigation, such as the discovery of new facts or changes in parties or in the substantive or procedural law, will necessitate reconsideration of the earlier order and the granting or denial of certification or redefinition of the class. Reconsideration under Rule 23(c)(1) may be on motion of any party or sua sponte by the court issuing a show cause order. The procedure to be followed is similar to that for the original hearing under Rule 23(c)(1), although in the later stages of the litigation there may be less need for an evidentiary hearing. In decid - ing whether to modify its original decision, the court should consider not only the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) in the light of the facts and issues of the case, but also whether the parties or the class would be unfairly prejudiced by a change in the proceedings at that point. 30.2 Communication with Class Members .21 Notices from the Court 224 .211 Certification Notice 224 .212 Settlement Notice 227 .213 Other Court Notices 229 .22 Communications from Class Members to the Court 230 .23 Gathering Information from Class 231 .231 Opting Out 231 .232 Discovery from Class Members 231 .24 Other Communications 232 Communication with the class is a major concern in the management of class ac - tions.

The law provides little definitive guidance in this area, so much is left to the court’s judgment. 30.21 Notices from the Court .211 Certification Notice 224 .212 Settlement Notice 227 .213 Other Court Notices 229 Notice to class members is mandated in two circumstances: (1) when a class is certified under Rule 23(b)(3); and (2) when the parties propose to dismiss or compromise (settle) a class action. Because Rule 23(c)(2) provides that “the court shall direct [notice of a (b)(3) action] to the members of the class,” notice is gen - erally given in the name of the court and appears as notice from the court, al - though typically prepared and distributed by one of the parties. Notice under Rule 23(e) of a proposed dismissal or compromise must be given “as the court di - rects,” and the same procedure is generally followed. In addition, the court may require notice to be given as directed whenever needed “for the protection of class members or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action.” 705 Notice is closely related to other aspects of the management of class actions, in particular certification and settlement; this section should therefore be read in conjunction with the rest of this chapter. 30.211 Certification Notice Notice that the case has been certified as a class action, required for (b)(3) ac - tions, may at times be advisable for (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes as well. As discussed in supra section 30.14, many cases meet the standards of Rule 23(b)(3) as well as those of (b)(1) or (b)(2). No generalization can be made as to whether or when the provisions of Rule 23(c)(2) (individual notice and right of exclusion) apply in such circumstances. Giving notice may help bring to light conflicting interests or antagonistic positions within the class conflicts of which the court was not aware at the time of the certification hearing, and dissatisfaction with the fairness and adequacy of representation. Notice will lessen the vulnerability of the final judg - ment to collateral attack by class members. 706 While Rule 23 gives no specific guidance on the timing of notice to class members, notice should ordinarily be given promptly after the certification order is issued. Sometimes, as when the parties are nearing settlement or developments 705 . Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(d). 706 . See 7A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R.

The court should not permit delay, however, if statute of limitations problems could result. If the court certifies a class more nar - row than that set forth in the complaint, the statute of limitations will again start to run against those excluded from the class, and delay in giving notice of the class definition may prejudice them. Rule 23(c)(2) specifies the content of the notice in (b)(3) actions: (1) the right of any class member to opt out if request is made by a specified date; (2) the binding effect of the judgment, favorable or unfavorable, on all class members who do not opt out; and (3) the right of any class member to appear through counsel. In addition, sufficient information about the case should be provided to enable class members to make an informed decision about their participation. Thus, the notice should: • describe succinctly and simply the substance of the action and the posi - tions of the parties; • identify the opposing parties, class representatives, and counsel; • indicate the relief sought; • explain any special risks of class members, such as being bound by the judgment, while emphasizing that the court has not ruled on the merits of any claims or defenses; and • describe clearly the procedures and deadlines for opting out. A simple form for exercising this right of exclusion should be attached to the no - tice. 707 Counsel usually submit a draft of the proposed notice to the court for its review, revision, and approval. The notice should be accurate, objective, and un - derstandable to class members, which may require that it be printed in more than one language. 708 Rule 23(c)(2) requires that individual notice in (b)(3) actions be given to class members “who can be identified through reasonable effort,” with others given “the best notice practicable under the circumstances.” 709 When the names and addresses of most class members are known, notice by mail (generally first- class mail 710 ) is usually required.

Publications that are likely to be read by class members should be selected. Financial and legal journals or sections of newspapers, while useful to a degree, are not likely to be read by many members of the general pub - lic. The determination of what efforts to identify and notify are reasonable under the circumstances of the case rests in the discretion of the judge before whom the class action is pending; notification may ultimately become an issue if the estop - pel effect of the class action judgment is challenged in other litigation. The manner in which notice is given can be a source of controversy in class actions. It implicates issues of cost and fairness to the parties and class members, and potential prejudice to one side or the other. The manner of giving notice can encourage or discourage the assertion of certain claims, or can be so costly and burdensome as to frustrate plaintiffs’ ability to maintain the action. 711 In securities cases, for example, the shares of many class members may be held in street name by brokers or financial institutions as nominees, and, depend - ing on the circumstances, giving notice to these nominees alone may not suffice to give notice to the class members. 712 The class representatives are usually able to make satisfactory financial arrangements with the nominees for the class members to forward the notices or at least provide a list of the names and ad - dresses of the beneficial owners. If the nominees are not willing and are not par - ties to the litigation, a subpoena duces tecum can be issued directing them to pro - duce the records from which the class representatives can compile a mailing list. If the litigation is eventually terminated favorably to the class, the representatives may be entitled to reimbursement for these expenses, from either the entire fund recovered for the class, that part of the fund recovered on behalf of security hold - ers whose shares were held in street names, or perhaps the defendants. 713 The problems of notice may be even more critical with classes composed of individual purchasers of goods or services, since sales records may be lacking or be incomplete and unreliable. Creativity is often needed in devising an effective means of notifying class members. 714 On occasion, notice has been distributed with a defendant company’s mailings to shareholders, credit card holders, or customers, or in its employees’ pay envelopes, but such procedures have been 711 . Ordinarily, the time and expense of identifying and notifying class members must be borne, at least initially, by the class representatives.

Any increased administrative costs to the defendant caused by the alternative means of notice should be taken into account. The parties seeking class certification must initially bear the cost of preparing and distributing the certification notice required by Rule 23(c)(2) 716 and the expense of identifying the class members. 717 Individual class representatives are, however, responsible only for their pro rata share, 718 and counsel for the class may properly advance such costs with repayment contingent on recovery. 719 The court should require class counsel to keep accurate and complete records of the steps taken to give notice, providing documentation not only if costs are ulti - mately taxed against the defendants but also if post-judgment attacks are made on the adequacy of notice. Class representatives may also be required to pay the initial cost of preparing and distributing certification notice when it is ordered in (b)(1) and (b)(2) ac - tions. The class representatives, however, are not required by Rule 23 to pay this cost; courts sometimes have required that these costs be borne by the defendants, particularly when such notice is given at their request (for greater assurance that the judgment will be binding on class members). 30.212 Settlement Notice Rule 23(e) states that class actions “shall not be dismissed or compromised with - out the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compro - mise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court di - rects.” Settlement notices are subject to many of the same considerations outlined above for certification notices.

It should • describe the essential terms of the proposed settlement; • disclose any special benefits provided to the class representatives; • provide information regarding attorneys’ fees (see supra section 24.1); • indicate the time and place of the hearing to consider approval of the set - tlement, and the method for objecting to (or, if permitted, for opting out of) the settlement; • explain the procedures for allocating and distributing settlement funds, and, if the settlement provides different kinds of relief for different cate - gories of class members, clearly set out those variations; and • prominently display the address and phone number of class counsel and the procedure for making inquiries. 721 If the details of a claims procedure have been determined, claims forms may be included with the settlement notice. Often, however, the details of allocation and distribution are not established until after the settlement is approved. The text of the proposed settlement may or may not be included in the notice, depending on its length and clarity. If the agreement itself is not distributed, the notice must contain a clear, accurate description of the key terms and tell class members where they can examine or secure a copy, such as from the clerk’s office, class counsel, or a defendant’s employment office. If a class settlement is tentatively approved before notice of certification has been given, certification and settlement notices should be combined, reducing the expense of notice and avoiding the confusion that separate notification of certification and settlement would produce. 722 If the class has been certified only conditionally for settlement purposes, that fact should be disclosed. Even though a settlement is proposed, the original claims, relief sought, and defenses should be outlined; such information is necessary for class members to make an informed decision.

Similar problems may arise where counsel for the class take procedural actions prior to certification that may affect the members of the class, such as amending the pleadings to delete certain parties or claims, dismissing the action without prejudice, or failing to oppose a summary judgment motion (see infra section 30.213). 726 30.213 Other Court Notices Rule 23(d)(2) authorizes the court to require that notice be given: for the protection of the members of the class . . . of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action.

The court may also require notice to certain class members to correct misinformation or misrepresentations, or to inform them of a significant change in class counsel or representatives. The type and contents of the notice and who should bear the cost depend on the circumstances that give rise to the need for it—what prompted it, who should be notified, whose duties it discharges, and when it is given. Thus, the cost of a notice to correct misstatements made by defense counsel should be borne by de - fendants. Named plaintiffs should usually be required to pay for a notice to an - nounce a change in class representation. In some situations, costs should be di - vided. 30.22 Communications from Class Members to the Court Since the court is generally identified in the notices that go to putative or actual class members, the court in the normal course can expect to receive inquiries about the litigation from them and from members of the public. The court should establish a procedure for the clerk’s office to handle such inquiries. A rou - tine procedure should be set up for referring inquiries from persons who may have claims in the action to counsel for the class. To the extent that the clerk’s office itself has been assigned specific responsibilities, such as handling claims or requests to be heard, it needs to set up procedures to handle such matters efficiently and fairly. There should rarely be any reason for the judge to be in - volved. If communications from the class—such as assertions that counsel have re - fused to respond to their inquiries—indicate the possibility of inadequate repre - sentation, the court may take appropriate steps, such as holding a hearing, ad - monishing counsel, or substituting new class counsel (see supra section 30.16). 728 .

The procedure for making the election should be made simple, and class members should be afforded a reasonable time to exercise their option. Courts usually establish a period of thirty to sixty days following mailing of the notice, or longer if appropriate, for filing the election. A form for use by putative class members who wish to opt out may be included with the notice; it should explain, in clear and concise language, the available alterna - tives and their consequences. Typically, the court directs that the notices be filed with the clerk, although in large class actions the court may arrange for a special mailing address and designate a committee of counsel to assume responsibility for receiving, time-stamping, tabulating, and entering into a database the infor - mation from responses (such as name, address, and social security number). The court may, in its discretion, treat as effective a tardy election to opt out. In exercising its discretion, the court should consider the reasons for the delay, whether there was excusable neglect, and whether prejudice resulted. 729 Relief from deadlines, however, should ordinarily be granted only if the delinquency is not substantial or if there is good cause; the parties should be entitled to rely in their conduct of the litigation on the state of the class as of the end of the opt-out period. A general extension of time for making the election may be appropriate if, due to logistical problems, a further mailing or publication is needed. Counsel should maintain careful records of those who opt out and when, both to comply with Rule 23(c)(3) and for use in allocating and distributing funds obtained in the litigation for the class. A computer database will be helpful if the class is large. 30.232 Discovery from Class Members Post-certification discovery directed at individual class members (other than named plaintiffs) should be permitted only to the extent necessary and should be carefully limited to ensure that it serves a legitimate purpose and is not used to harass either the class representatives or the class members (see supra section 30.12).

This may be appropriate in connection with preparation for the second stage of a bifurcated trial (with adequate time al - lowed for discovery) or the determination of entitlement to individual relief un - der a judgment or settlement (see infra section 30.47).

Although no formal attorney–client relationship exists between class counsel and the putative members of the class prior to class certification, there is at least an incipient fiduciary relationship between class counsel and the class he or she is seeking to represent. 741 While notice from the court to class members is in tended to provide them with all the information they need (and should be care fully drafted with this in mind), counsel are free to provide additional informa tion, respond to inquiries, and seek information needed to represent the class. 742 The court may want to admonish counsel, early in the proceeding, about the importance of fairness and accuracy in communications with class members and make clear that misrepresentations or other misconduct in dealing with the class would impair the fairness and adequacy of representation under Fed.

Once a class is certified, the rules governing communications apply as though each class member is a client of class counsel. Under accepted ethical principles, defendants and their attorneys may communicate on matters regarding the liti - gation with class members who have not opted out, but only through class coun - sel. 747 Communications with class members in the ordinary course of business, unrelated to the litigation, are not barred. Moreover, where appropriate, defen - dants’ counsel may by court order be authorized to answer inquiries from class members about a proposed class settlement. If improper communications occur, curative action may be necessary, such as extending deadlines for opting out, in - tervening or responding to a proposed settlement, or voiding improperly solicited opt outs. Other sanctions, such as disclosure of information gained in violation of the attorney–client relationship, 748 contempt and fines, 749 assessment of fees, or, in an egregious situation, the replacement of counsel or of a class representa tive, may be justified. 750 The restrictions on communications may create problems in some cases. For example, in employment discrimination class actions, key individuals in supervi - sory positions, on whom the employer must rely both for evidence and for assist - ing its attorneys, may be members of the class. The employer’s defense would be seriously handicapped if direct communications were barred. In such circum - stances, the court may consider certification under Rule 23(b)(3) (enabling class members to opt out), exclusion of such persons from the class if they have no genuine claims, certification of a subclass, or entry of an order under Rule 23(d) permitting individuals, although remaining as class members, to renounce repre - sentation by class counsel and thereby become directly accessible to the employ - er’s attorneys. 30.3 Relationship to Other Cases Claims identical or similar to those made in a class action may be the subject of other litigation, either in the same court or in other federal or state courts. 746 .

Other class actions may be filed, or even certified, with pro - posed classes that overlap or are even identical. The pendency of such cases is a relevant consideration in deciding whether to certify a class and how to define it (see supra section 30.15). Class actions should be coordinated with related individual cases pending in the same court, including adversary proceedings in bankruptcy. 751 When (b)(3) classes are being certified, the court should plan for the possibility that persons may opt out to file their own cases. Planning should include coordination of dis - covery (making discovery taken or to be taken available and usable in other cases) and trials, including (if trials are not consolidated) sequencing of trials. Consolidation for trial of class and individual actions may be useful, 752 both to avoid duplicative trials and to prevent inequitable nonmutual collateral estop - pel. 753 Where cases are pending in different courts, coordination can be ac - complished using techniques described in infra section 31.

If the court has reserva - tions, it may advise the parties, who may wish to resume negotiations in an effort to remove potential obstacles to approval. If the preliminary evaluation of the proposed settlement does not disclose grounds to doubt its fairness or other obvious deficiencies, such as unduly prefer - ential treatment of class representatives or of segments of the class, or excessive compensation for attorneys, and appears to fall within the range of possible ap - proval, the court should direct that notice under Rule 23(e) be given to the class members of a formal fairness hearing, at which arguments and evidence may be presented in support of and in opposition to the settlement. For economy, courts have in appropriate cases permitted the notice under Rule 23(c)(2) to be com - bined with the Rule 23(e) notice. Approval is required of the settlement of any action brought as a class action, regardless of whether the settlement occurs prior to certification, and even if the only claims being settled are those of the individ - ual plaintiffs, with the class claims being dismissed without prejudice. Notice is required of any settlement of class claims and is considered advisable even if only the individual claims of the named plaintiffs are settled (see supra sec- tion 30.212). 760 The notice of the fairness hearing should direct persons wishing to do so to file statements of their objections with the clerk of court by a specified date in ad - vance of the hearing. Opportunity should be provided at the hearing for all ob - jections to the settlement to be presented to the court whether a written statement has been filed previously or not. The same objection need not be heard more than once, although the court may wish to ascertain how many of those in attendance agree or disagree with some proposition.

The proponents of the settlement should be required to satisfy their burden of showing “that the settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable.” 761 Even if no objections have been filed and no adverse appearances made, the court should make a sufficient record and enter specific findings to satisfy a reviewing court that it has made the requisite inquiry and has considered the diverse interests and the factors implicated in the determination of fairness, adequacy, and reasonable - ness. 30.42 Role of the Court Rule 23(e) states that a “class action shall not be dismissed or compromised with - out the approval of the court.” Rule 23.1 contains a similar direction for share - holder derivative actions. In determining whether a settlement should be ap - proved, the court must decide whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate under the circumstances and whether the interests of the class as a whole are better served if the litigation is resolved by the settlement rather than pursued. Although settlement is favored, court review must not be perfunctory; the dynamics of class action settlement may lead the negotiating parties—even those with the best in - tentions—to give insufficient weight to the interests of at least some class mem - bers. The court’s responsibility is particularly weighty when reviewing a settle - ment involving a non-opt-out class or future claimants. Generally, the court will first consider whether counsel had sufficient infor - mation to arrive at an informed evaluation, the likelihood of success at trial, and the range of possible recovery. The extent of discovery may be relevant in deter - mining the adequacy of the parties’ knowledge of the case. In cases seeking pri - marily monetary relief, this analysis entails a comparison of the amount of the proposed settlement with the present value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if successful, appropriately discounted for the risk of not prevailing. The defendant’s inability to pay a greater amount may be a relevant factor, as may the plaintiffs’ need for immediate relief. Expert testimony may assist the court in making its evaluation. 762 Where settlement is proposed early in the litigation, before significant discov - ery, the court and class counsel may have a limited factual basis for assessing its merits. In some cases, the court may require further discovery to justify the set - tlement or to secure information needed to implement it, such as determining a fair allocation.

If attorneys’ fees will be awarded out of a settlement fund, the court should ascertain when the settlement was effectively reached; discovery undertaken after that time may have been unnecessary. The court should monitor post-settlement discovery and limit it to that genuinely needed. The settlement cannot be evaluated simply by reference to a mathematical yardstick. Other relevant factors that may be taken into account in the determi - nation of the settlement’s fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness include whether: • the named plaintiffs are the only class members to receive monetary re - lief, or are to receive relief that is disproportionately large; 763 • the settlement amount is much less than that sought in the complaint or indicated by preliminary discovery; • major claims or types of relief sought in the complaint have been omitted from the settlement; • particular segments of the class are treated significantly differently from others; • claimants who are not members of the class are treated significantly dif - ferently; • many class members object to the settlement; and • apparently cogent objections have been raised. Provisions in the settlement for the payment of class counsel’s fees also re - quire attention. In class actions whose primary objective is the recovery of money damages, settlements may be negotiated on the basis of a lump sum that covers both class claims and attorneys’ fees. Although there is no bar to such arrange - ments, 764 the simultaneous negotiation of class relief and attorneys’ fees creates a potential for conflict. 765 Separate negotiation of the class settlement before an agreement on fees is generally preferable to avoid conflicts of interest between the attorneys and their clients, the class (see generally supra sections 24.22, 24.23, on court-awarded attorneys’ fees). This procedure does not entirely eliminate the risk of conflict, and, if negotiations are to be conducted in stages, counsel must scrupulously avoid making concessions affecting the class for personal advantage.

Moreover, the sum of the two amounts ordinarily should be treated as a settlement fund for the benefit of the class, with the agreed-on fee amount constituting the upper limit on the fees that can be awarded to counsel. In any event, the judge may condition approval of the settlement on independent review of the agreed attorneys’ compensation. Class members should be advised of the potential impact of the fee determi - nation on the amount available to satisfy the class claim. Unless an upper limit is set, class members will not be adequately advised of what they can expect from the proposed settlement. Courts sometimes require that fee applications be sub - mitted before notice of the proposed settlement is sent to the class, so that the notice can contain full information about the fee requests. The need for close re - view of provisions for attorneys’ fees is particularly acute where the settlement provides for distribution in kind to the plaintiff class in lieu of money. Attorneys may receive large sums out of a settlement that provides only speculative benefits to the class. 766 Depending on the law in the jurisdiction, the court may need to be concerned with agreements among counsel allocating fees. 767 Another potential source of conflict exists when class counsel concurrently settle cases of individual plaintiffs. The court should examine the fee arrange - ments to ensure that they do not result in some plaintiffs being favored over oth - ers. The court’s role in settlement is limited, however. The court may only ap - prove or disapprove the settlement; it is not empowered to rewrite the agreement between the parties. A statement of the judge’s reasons for disapproval, however, may lead to revisions that satisfy the objections (see supra section 23.14). In eval - uating the settlement, the judge should keep in mind the unique ability of class and defense counsel to assess the potential risks and rewards of litigation; a pre - sumption of fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness may attach to a class settle - ment reached in arms-length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel after meaningful discovery. 768 If the court makes suggestions at the time the settlement agreement is submitted for tentative approval, the parties may be willing to make changes prior to the time the agreement is submitted to the class members for their consideration. If substantial changes adversely affecting some members of the class are made at the time of the settlement hearing, a new hear - ing and additional notice may be necessary. 766 .

But they are also responsible for protecting the interests of the class, even in circumstances where the class representatives—their direct clients—take a position that counsel con - sider contrary to those interests. 769 Class counsel must discuss with the class representatives the terms of any settlement offered to the class, but rejection of the offer by the representatives does not end the attorneys’ obligations, since they must act as they believe to be in the best interests of the class as a whole. 770 If counsel for the class doubt the desirability of a settlement offer but have little rea - son to believe a better offer will soon be made, they should communicate the proposal to the court for a determination of whether it should be submitted to the class and the court for approval. Similarly, class counsel should bring to the court’s attention any settlement offer that the class representatives approve, even if, as attorneys for the entire class, they believe it should not receive court ap - proval. Counsel for the parties are the court’s main source of information concerning the settlement. They must fully disclose all agreements and understandings and be prepared to explain how the settlement was reached and why it is fair and rea - sonable. They must also disclose any facet of the settlement that may adversely affect any member of the class or may result in unequal treatment of members of the class. The judge should ensure that these obligations are met. Ordinarily, counsel should confer with the court to develop an appropriate program for the two-step process of approval (see supra section 30.41). Based on information from counsel, the court will be able to determine the nature of the hearing and the kind of proof indicated for preliminary approval. The submission to the court will consist of the settlement documents and a draft order setting a hearing date and prescribing the notice to be given to class members and the pro - cedure for presenting objections. The court may also call for statements covering such matters as the status of discovery, the identity of those involved in the set - tlement discussions, the arrangements and understandings about attorneys’ fees, and an explanation why the settlement is believed to be in the best interests of the class. Any benefits to be received only by the class representatives should also be disclosed and explained. At the hearing to consider final approval of the proposed settlement, counsel for the settling parties will be called on to make an appropriate showing on the record why the settlement should be approved. How detailed these explanations 769 . See, e.g., Flinn v. FMC Corp., 528 F.2d 1169 (4th Cir. 1975); cf. Saylor v. Lindsley, 456 F.2d 896 (2d Cir. 1972); Parker v.

Counsel’s task in justifying the proposed settlement after having vigorously advocated their respective positions is challenging but no less important. Counsel owe a duty of candor to the court to disclose all information relevant to the fairness of the settlement. If the class was certified in adversary proceedings, counsel need also to take into account their ongoing obligation to their clients and the need to protect their position should the settlement fail. In evaluating the settlement, the court may want to take into account not only the presentations of counsel but also information from other sources, such as comments from class representatives and class members, the judge’s own knowledge of the case ob - tained during pretrial proceedings, and information provided by persons who in unusual cases may be appointed by the court as special masters or as experts to assess the settlement. If the proposed settlement is to be implemented through a settlement class (see infra section 30.45), counsel have a heightened duty to the court, since the proceedings are, in effect, ex parte. They must disclose all facts bearing on the fairness of the settlement, including those that may be adverse to their position. The court may need to appoint a special master to examine the settlement on its behalf, particularly where complicated mathematical calculations or other tasks requiring special expertise are involved. Class counsel should make themselves available to answer questions from class members in the interval between notice of the settlement and the settlement hearing. The notice may advise that questions be directed to class counsel and give counsel’s address and telephone number. When most of the class members reside in the same locale—for example, in employment discrimination cases—a meeting may be scheduled at which the class attorneys and class representatives personally explain the terms and consequences of the proposed settlement. 30.44 Role of Class Representatives Class counsel should consult the class representatives during negotiations. The representatives’ views may be important in shaping the agreement and will usu - ally be presented at the fairness hearing; they may be entitled to special weight be - cause the representatives may have a better understanding of the case than most members of the class. Their objections to a settlement, moreover, may be symp - tomatic of strained attorney–client relations that may have affected settlement negotiations. Accordingly, opposition by class representatives to a proposed set - tlement needs to be taken seriously by the court, and the notice of the settlement"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Class Actions 243 hearing should usually indicate any terms about which class counsel and class representatives differ. Although rejection of a proposed settlement by a class representative may lead class counsel not to present the matter to the court, a class representative cannot veto a settlement that has been presented to and approved by the court. 771 The court should not permit representatives, in violation of their fiduciary responsibilities, to place their individual interests ahead of the class’s and impede a desirable settlement on behalf of the class. Therefore, while the ob jections of class representatives must be considered by the court, they do not pre clude a settlement that resolves the claims of the class, including those of the rep- resentatives. When class representatives favor acceptance of a settlement offer that class counsel believe is inadequate, they should be permitted to submit it to the court for preliminary approval and, if the court so orders, a fairness hearing. Although the court will ordinarily not approve a settlement that counsel do not recom - mend, class counsel—like class representatives—have no veto power over settle - ment of class actions. 30.45 Settlement Classes Occasionally, before a class is certified, parties enter into settlement agreements, which provide for certification of a class as defined therein, for settlement pur - poses only. Such settlement classes facilitate global settlements. They also permit defendants to settle while preserving the right to contest the propriety and scope of the class allegations if the settlement is not approved and, in Rule 23(b)(3) ac - tions, to withdraw from the settlement if too many class members opt out. The costs of litigating class certification are saved and litigation expense is generally reduced by an early settlement. 772 For these reasons, courts permit the use of settlement classes and the negotia - tion of settlement before class certification. 773 Approval under Rule 23(e) of settlements involving settlement classes, however, requires closer judicial scrutiny than approval of settlements where class certification has been litigated. As noted in supra section 30.42, an early settlement will find the court and class counsel less informed than if substantial discovery had occurred. As a result, the court will 771 .

The court should provide an ad - equate opportunity for proponents and opponents to make a full showing of all relevant matters. Settlement classes can raise numerous issues, including conflicts of interest. Some of these issues are the following: • Conflicts between class counsel and counsel for individual plaintiffs. Approval of the class will in effect largely convert individual claimants falling within its definition from clients of their attorneys into clients of class counsel. It will also effectively terminate their pending individual and class actions. Because of these effects, divergent interests must be taken into account and fairly accommodated. The court should consider whether the group of counsel who have negotiated the settlement has fairly represented the interests of all. • Protection of future claimants. The court should consider the impact of the settlement on persons who may not currently be aware that they have a claim or whose claim may not yet have come into existence. Since they cannot be given meaningful notice, they may be particularly prejudiced by the settlement, and their opt-out rights (in a Rule 23(b)(3) action) may be illusory. • Administration of claims procedure. The court should consider whether the persons chosen to administer the procedure are disinterested or have conflicts arising from their representation of individual claimants. • Partial settlements. Settlement classes present special problems when used with partial settlements. Members of the settlement class may have difficulty understanding their position in the litigation. Moreover, since they will not know whether they will be members of a class with respect to claims against nonsettling defendants, they may be unable to make an informed decision regarding the adequacy of the settlement. (See infra section 30.46.) • Conditional settlements. The parties may propose a precertification set - tlement that permits the settling parties to withdraw from the settlement if a specified number of persons opt out of the class or of the settlement. Although this may promote settlement by giving a defendant greater as - surance of ending the controversy and avoiding the expense of litigating numerous individual claims, it may also prolong uncertainty by delaying a final settlement. An alternate approach is to provide that the benefits paid to the class will be reduced in proportion to the number of opt outs or the total amount of their claims."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Class Actions 245 • Additional barred claims. Some settlements, particularly in securities liti - gation, are conditioned on settlors waiving claims for additional time pe - riods not covered by the pleadings or waiving additional potential claims against the settling defendants. Because such waivers raise a potential for abuse, they should be reviewed to ascertain their justification and the compensating benefit to the class for surrendering such claims. A settlement will occasionally cover a class different from that certified. Typically, the parties propose to enlarge the class—or the claims of the class—to give the settling defendants greater protection against future litigation, although sometimes they may seek to reduce the class. The problem presented by these re - quests is not the lack of sufficient information and scrutiny, but rather the pos - sibility that fiduciary responsibilities of class counsel or class representatives may have been compromised. The parties should be required to explain in detail what new facts, changed circumstances, or earlier errors support the alteration of the original definition. If a (b)(3) class is enlarged, notice must be given to the new members of their right to opt out; if a class is reduced, notice should be given un - der Rule 23(d) to those being excluded, since the statute of limitations will begin to run again on their claims. 30.46 Partial Settlements The fairness of partial settlements may be particularly difficult to evaluate. Because the litigation may continue against others, the parties may be reluctant to disclose fully and candidly their assessment of strengths and weaknesses that led to the settlement. Moreover, the adequacy of the settlement depends in part on the relative exposure of other parties; an apparently generous settlement offer from a single defendant may be questionable if there are no realistic prospects of recovery against nonsettling defendants and, conversely, a partial settlement pro - viding little relief may be entirely satisfactory if the settling defendant has strong defenses or is impecunious. An informed evaluation may be almost impossible if discovery is incomplete or has been conducted against only a few of the defen - dants; subsequent discovery may reveal that a proposed settlement is not in the best interests of the class. Consideration must also be given to whether the settling defendant may be liable to the class as a whole or only to certain members of the class. Despite these problems, partial settlements are common in resolving class ac - tions and may be entitled to approval. If several such settlements are being nego - tiated, the court should ordinarily defer consideration until all are submitted, saving the time and expense of successive notices and hearings, and allowing the court and class members to assess the adequacy of the settlements as a whole. Funds received from the settlements typically are placed in income-producing"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"246 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third trusts established by class counsel for the benefit of the class, and held until the case is fully resolved. Partial settlements shortly before trial may disrupt the trial plan; they may, for example, result in the departure of a lead counsel. The court should usually set a deadline for the presentation of partial settlements sufficiently in advance of trial so that fairness hearings may be completed while allowing the parties sufficient time to prepare for trial whether the settlements are approved or not (see supra section 23.21). The court should be reluctant to approve partial settlements containing pro - visions that might interfere with further proceedings, such as those attempting to limit further discovery (see supra section 23.22). A provision under which the class agrees to a refund if it later settles on terms more favorable to other defen - dants is particularly inappropriate, since the adequacy of the proposed settlement cannot be fairly determined when its amount is uncertain. Similarly, a defendan - t’s agreement to increase the settlement fund if individual plaintiffs later settle for a greater amount does not diminish the court’s responsibility to evaluate the ade - quacy of the amount offered to the class (see supra section 23.23). Although the court may give some deference to provisions purporting to allocate a settlement fund according to particular theories of recovery, claims, or time periods, it should reserve the power to make modifications when warranted by further de - velopments (see supra section 23.21). 30.47 Administration Class settlements are rarely self-executing; various problems may arise in their administration, not limited to clerical or ministerial matters. Sometimes a settle - ment fund is to be divided equally among all class members who meet specified criteria (for example, employees who sought promotion during a specified pe - riod) or allocated in proportion to some measure of damage or injury (for ex - ample, the price paid for particular securities). In such cases, the class members are in potentially conflicting roles, since increasing one claimant’s benefits will reduce another’s. In cases where the settlement provides for a specified payment to each qualifying class member—either a flat sum or an amount determined ac - cording to a formula—settling defendants will have an interest in maximizing the extent to which class members are found to be disqualified or have their claims reduced, diminishing the total amount to be paid. Class members are usually required to file claim forms providing details about their claims and other information needed to administer the settle ment. 774 Verification under oath or affirmation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 may be required, and in some cases it may be appropriate to require substantiation of the 774 . See Sample Order infra § 41.44."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Class Actions 247 claims—for example, through invoices, confirmations, or brokers’ records. Completion and documentation of the claim forms should be made no more burdensome than necessary to implement the settlement. Nor, for purposes of administering a settlement, should the court necessarily require the same amount and specificity of evidence that might be needed to establish damages at a trial; secondary forms of proof and estimates derived from other sources should generally be acceptable. In order to achieve the intended distribution to beneficiaries, additional mailings, telephone calls, and investigative searches may be needed if notices to class members are returned or if class members fail to submit claim forms. In some cases, as where the defendants’ records provide a satisfactory, inexpensive, and accurate method for determining the distribution of a settlement fund, there will be no need to require action by class members. A procedure should be established for recording receipt of the claim forms and tabulating their contents. These arrangements are usually made by class counsel and approved by the court. If the class is large, forms are customarily sent to a separate mailing address and the essential information is recorded on com - puters. Form letters may be prepared to answer common inquiries from class members and to deal with recurring errors in completing the claim forms. These activities should be memorialized to minimize subsequent disputes. The audit and review procedures needed will depend on the nature of the case. Claims of modest amounts are frequently accepted solely on the basis of the verified claim forms. 775 Medium-sized claims—or some of them selected by statistical sampling—may be subjected to telephone audit inquiries or cross - checks against other records. Large claims may warrant a field audit. A claims committee or special master may be appointed to take custody of settlement funds and administer the distribution procedure. The committee or special master may be charged with reviewing all claims or those that are late, deficient in documentation, or questionable for other reasons. This review may be made merely by considering the materials submitted or may involve a hearing at which the claimant and other interested parties may present additional infor - mation bearing on the claim. Provision should be made for judicial review of the findings of the committee or special master unless the terms of the settlement provide that these findings are final under Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(4). Periodic re - ports should be made to the court of the interest earned, distributions made, al - lowance and disallowance of claims, and other matters involving the status of administration. 775 . See infra § 41.44."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"248 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third The settlement may provide for disposition of unclaimed or undistributable funds. 776 Judicial approval is required for such disposition, and the parties may want to provide guidance on whether the funds should be returned to the settling defendant, escheat to the government, be paid to other class members, or be dis - tributed to a charitable or nonprofit institution. Adequate time should be allowed for late claims before any refund or other disposition of settlement funds occurs. A reserve for late claims may also be established. The equitable powers of the court may be invoked to deal with other prob - lems that commonly arise during administration of settlement but may not be covered by the terms of the agreement, such as: • the impact of divorce, death, incompetence, claims by minors, and disso - lution of business entities or other organizations; • investment of settlement funds (security of settlement funds is critical— the court should permit these funds to be held in only the most secure investments); • interim distributions and partial payments of fees and expenses; and • procedures for handling lost or returned checks (although checks should ordinarily be stamped with a legend requiring deposit or negotiation within ninety days, counsel should be authorized to grant additional time). The court and counsel should be alert to the possibility of persons soliciting class members after the settlement, offering to provide “collection services” for a percentage of the claims; such activities may fraudulently deprive class members of benefits provided by the settlement and impinge on the court’s responsibility to control fees in class actions. 777 776 .

Multiple claims may, of course, be aggregated in a single class action if the prerequisites of Rule 23 are met. Frequently, though, separate lawsuits are initiated asserting similar claims, or class members opt out to file their own cases. Occasionally, peripheral claims in complex litigation will lead to multiple cases, as in the case of insurance cover - age litigation or reactive litigation motivated by forum preferences. Control of the proliferation of cases and coordination of multiple claims is crucial to effective management of complex litigation. When the limitations of federal jurisdiction preclude control, voluntary means may nevertheless be available to achieve coor - dination and thereby reduce duplicative activity, minimize the risks of conflict, and avoid unnecessary expense.

The most powerful device for aggregating multiple litigation pending in fed - eral and state courts—the bankruptcy law 778 —is beyond the scope of this man ual .

In some cases (e.g., large aircraft disasters) the need for multidistrict treatment may be apparent at the outset, and counsel should initiate proceedings before the panel shortly after the second case is filed. Sometimes, however, the justification for transfer may not arise until later in the proceedings, either because additional cases have been filed unexpectedly or because efforts to achieve voluntary coordination have proved ineffective in reducing conflicts and duplication. Counsel should file their motion as soon as the need for transfer can be demonstrated; the panel is reluctant to transfer a case after significant proceedings have occurred or if the motion ap - pears to be motivated by a desire for delay or a change of judges. Once a transfer under § 1407 becomes effective—when the order granting the transfer is filed in the office of the clerk of the transferee court—the jurisdiction of the transferor court ceases and the transferee court has exclusive jurisdic tion. 792 During the pendency of a motion (or show cause order) for transfer, however, the court in which the action was filed retains jurisdiction over the case. 793 The transferor court should not automatically stay discovery (provisions in local rules or expense and delay reduction plans that may mandate early commencement of discovery need to be taken into account and an order modifying their impact on the litigation may be necessary), postpone rulings on pending motions, or generally suspend further proceedings upon being notified of the filing of a motion for transfer. 794 Matters such as motions to dismiss or to remand, raising issues unique to the particular case, may be resolved before the panel acts on the motion to transfer. Sometimes the panel has concluded that it should delay its ruling on transfer until critical motions have been decided by the court in which the case is pending. The pendency of motions raising questions common to related actions, however, can be an additional justification for trans fer. 795 At the same time, it may be advisable to defer certain matters until the panel has the opportunity to rule on transfer.

The litigation is usually transferred to a judge in the transferee court, but occasionally the panel has selected a judge des ignated to sit specially in the transferee district on an intracircuit or intercircuit assignment. 31.132 During Period of Transfer After the transfer, the transferee judge 797 exercises not only the judicial powers in the transferee district but also “the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consoli dated proceedings.” 798 This supervisory power over depositions in other dis tricts may be exercised in person or by telephone. 799 The transferee judge may vacate or modify any order of a transferor court, including protective orders; 800 until altered, however, orders of the transferor court remain in effect. 801 Although the transferee judge has no jurisdiction to conduct a trial in the transferred cases, the judge may terminate actions by ruling on motions to dis - miss or for summary judgment or pursuant to settlement and may enter consent decrees. 802 Complexities may arise where the rulings turn on questions of sub - stantive law.

Ordinarily, it is advisable to provide that (1) tag-along actions shall be automatically made part of the centralized proceedings upon transfer to the transferee court, (2) rulings on common issues—for example, on the statute of limitations—shall be deemed to have been made in the tag-along action without the need for separate motions and orders, and (3) discovery already taken shall be available and usable in the tag-along cases. 808 Consideration should also be given to means of reducing duplicative discovery activity and expediting later tri als by measures such as videotaping key depositions or testimony given in bell wether trials, particularly of expert witnesses, for use at subsequent trials in the transferor courts after remand. One of the values of multidistrict proceedings is that they bring before a sin - gle judge all of the cases, parties, and counsel comprising the litigation. They therefore afford a unique opportunity for the negotiation of a global settlement.

When this should be done will depend on the circumstances of the litigation. In some cases, remands have been ordered relatively early, while substantial discovery remained to be done; in others, vir - tually all discovery had been completed and the cases were ready for trial at the time of remand to the transferor districts. Some of the constituent cases may be remanded, while others are retained for further centralized pretrial proceedings. The panel looks to the transferee court to suggest when remand should be ordered; that court needs to consider at what point remand will best serve the ex - peditious disposition of the litigation. Under its rules, the panel may also order remand on its own initiative or on the motion of a party. 809 Although autho rized to “separate any claim, cross claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim and remand any of such claims before the remainder of the action is remanded,” the panel has rejected most requests to exclude portions of a case from transfer under § 1407, 810 believing that such matters may be given individualized treatment by the transferee court if warranted, and has concluded that it has no power to transfer (or sever and remand) particular “issues,” as distinguished from particu - lar “claims.” 811 After remand, the transferor court has exclusive jurisdiction and further pro - ceedings in the transferee court with respect to a remanded case are not autho - rized absent a new transfer order by the panel. 812 Further pretrial proceedings, as needed, are then conducted in the transferor court; all cases remanded to the same court for additional proceedings and trial should be assigned at least initially to a single judge for coordination or consolidation in the transferor court.

One of the final actions of the transferee court should be entry of a pre - trial order that fully chronicles the proceedings, summarizes the rulings that will affect further proceedings, outlines the issues remaining for discovery and trial, and indicates the nature and expected duration of further pretrial proceedings; transferee courts are not expected to provide transferor courts with status reports during the pretrial proceedings. This order will assist the transferor courts in planning further proceedings and trial. In a few cases, the transferee judge has re - ceived intracircuit or intercircuit assignments under 28 U.S.C. § 292(b) and (d) to preside at trials of cases remanded to the transferor courts. 31.14 Coordination Between Courts When related cases are pending in different districts and cannot be transferred to a single district, judges should consider taking steps to coordinate proceedings in their respective courts to avoid or minimize duplicative activity and conflicts in the proceedings and actions of the courts. Coordination may lead to substantial savings in cost and time, but depends on effective communication between judges and among judges and counsel. Steps that may be taken include the following: • Special assignment of judge. All cases may be assigned to a single judge designated under 28 U.S.C. §§ 292–293, 296 to sit temporarily in other districts where the cases are pending. Judges may be designated to serve in districts both within and outside of their own circuit. • Lead case. Counsel in the various cases may agree with the judge to treat one as the “lead case.” The agreement may provide for staying proceed - ings in the other cases pending resolution of the lead case, or rulings in the lead case may be given presumptive, though not conclusive, effect in the other courts. • Joint conferences and orders. Joint hearings or conferences may be held and may be attended by all judges in person or by telephone. 814 The joint hearings may be followed by joint or parallel orders by the several courts in which the cases are pending. 813 .

The several courts may coordinate the appointment of joint experts under Fed. R. Evid. 706, or special masters under Fed. R. Civ. P. 53, to avoid duplicate activity and inconsistencies. This may be useful in resolving numerous claims of privilege made in a number of cases on similar facts, or where global settlement negotiations are under - taken. The courts may also coordinate in making appointments of lead or liaison counsel. • Avoiding duplicative discovery. Techniques to coordinate discovery and avoid duplication, such as those discussed in supra sections 21.423, 21.443, 21.452, and 21.464, should be considered. Deposition notices, in - terrogatories, and requests for productions should be filed or cross-filed in related cases to make the product of discovery usable in all cases and to avoid duplicative activity. Relevant discovery already completed should ordinarily be made available to litigants in the other cases. 815 If the ma - terial is subject to a protective order, the court usually may accommodate legitimate privacy interests by amending the order to include the new liti - gants within its restrictions, 816 and the party seeking the discovery may be required to bear an appropriate portion of the cost incurred in initially obtaining the information. Document production should be coordinated and joint depositories established. 817 To the extent practicable, the reso - lution of discovery disputes should be coordinated (e.g., by referring them to a single magistrate judge or special master). • Clarifying class definitions. Conflicts between class actions, or between a class action and individual actions, can be avoided by coordination in drafting class definitions when actions are certified. See infra sec- tion 31.32. • Stays. In appropriate cases, a judge may order an action stayed pending resolution of a related case in a federal court. See infra section 33.63. 815 . See Wilk v. American Medical Ass’n, 635 F.2d 1295, 1299 (7th Cir. 1980) (“Where an appropriate modification of a protective order can place private litigants in a position they would otherwise reach only after repetition of another’s discovery, such modification can be denied only where it would tangibly prejudice substantial rights of the party opposing modification. . . . Once such prejudice is demonstrated, however, the district court has broad discretion in judging whether that injury outweighs the benefits of any possible modification of the protective order.”). 816 . Id. at 1301. 817 . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2) (“The frequency or extent of use of [discovery] . . . shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery is unreasonably . . . duplicative, or is ob - tainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive. . . .”)."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"258 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 31.2 Related Criminal and Civil Cases Major problems of management arise in concurrent criminal and civil cases in - volving the same persons. Witnesses may claim the Fifth Amendment privilege in the civil actions, especially if examined prior to final resolution of the criminal proceedings, 818 and serious questions may arise as to the propriety of requiring an accused during the pendency of criminal charges to produce in civil proceed ings either adverse (although nonprivileged) evidence or exculpatory evidence to which the prosecution would not be entitled under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. The criminal proceeding should ordinarily have first priority because of the short pre - trial period allowed under the Speedy Trial Act 819 and because of the potential impact of a conviction. 820 Suspending all pretrial activities in civil litigation until the criminal proceeding has been concluded, however, may be unnecessary and inadvisable, since it may be possible to conduct major portions of the discov ery program in the civil cases without prejudice before completion of the criminal proceedings. 821 Because of the need for careful coordination, related criminal and civil cases should be assigned, if possible, to the same judge (though, as noted in supra sec - tion 20.12, circumstances may exist that make assignment to the same judge in - advisable). Although the MDL panel has no authority to transfer criminal cases, it has frequently ordered transfer of civil actions to the location of related criminal proceedings. If the cases are assigned to different judges, the judges should at least communicate and coordinate informally. If grand jury materials from another court are sought, the two-step procedure described in Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Northwest 822 must be followed. 818 . Termination of the criminal case will not necessarily result in testimony becoming available. See Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S. 248 (1983) (witness compelled by grant of “use im - munity” to give testimony to grand jury does not waive right to claim Fifth Amendment in subse - quent civil litigation). 819 .

Such litigation may involve numerous claims arising from a single event, such as a plane crash or a hotel fire, or from use of or exposure to harmful products or substances over a period of time (see infra section 33.2). Unless the defendant files for bankruptcy, no legal basis exists for the exercise of federal control over such litigation. Nevertheless, the cost and delay generated by such proliferation has led judges to undertake innovative efforts to bring about coor - dination of parallel or related litigation. 823 The approach to coordination will differ depending on the nature of the litigation; whether, for example, it arises out of a single event or out of a series of occurrences, and whether cases are pending within a single state or are dispersed across the country. Where all of the cases are pending in a single state, coordination is relatively easy to accomplish. States increasingly have adopted procedures for the assign - ment of complex multiparty litigation to a single judge or judicial panel, 824 fa - cilitating coordination between state and federal courts. Although the multidis - trict litigation panel has no power over cases pending in state courts, it sometimes transfers federal cases to a district where related cases are pending in the state courts, in order to facilitate coordination. In such situations, judges have at times been able to achieve substantial coordination of various aspects of pretrial: coor - dinating scheduling of discovery, motions, and other pretrial events; appointing lead or liaison counsel; developing a coordinated management plan for the entire litigation; providing for joint discovery, such as by cross-noticing of depositions and making discovery taken in one case available in other cases (reciprocity, cost - sharing, and future cooperation may be required as conditions to obtaining dis - covery for use in other litigation); coordinating rulings on discovery disputes, 823 . See generally William W Schwarzer et al., Judicial Federalism in Action: Coordination of Litigation in State and Federal Courts , 78 Va. L. Rev. 1689 (1992) (reporting on a study of eleven notable instances of state–federal coordination in litigation arising from (1) 1972 Federal Everglades Air Crash, (2) 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire, (3) 1979 Chicago Air Crash, (4) 1980 MGM Grand Hotel Fire, (5) 1981 Hyatt Skywalk Cases, (6) 1986 Technical Equities Fraud, (7) 1987 L’Ambience Plaza Collapse, (8) 1989 Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill, (9) 1989 Sioux City Air Crash, (10) Ohio asbestos litigation, and (11) Brooklyn Navy Yard asbestos litigation).

Some courts have considered the possibility of conducting a joint trial, at which sepa rate state and federal juries would sit in the same courtroom and hear common evidence, but substantial procedural and practical difficulties would have to be overcome. 826 Judges might agree that rulings on discovery or procedural matters of the court where a majority of the cases is pending be given presumptive effect by the other courts, or that the court with most of the cases take the lead in certain proceedings, such as class certification. 827 Coordination on a more lim ited basis can be achieved by designating the same attorneys to serve as lead coun sel, appointing the same special master to resolve discovery disputes or facilitate settlement discussions, or using joint document depositories. The common ex - perience of judges is that the willingness and ability to communicate effectively with each other is critical to the success of coordination. Counsel, however, can contribute substantially by initiating the effort and cooperating with it as it pro - ceeds. Differences in procedure between state and federal courts have not been impediments to useful coordination. Coordination becomes much more difficult and complex when cases are dis - persed across a number of states, even where the federal cases are all centered in a single MDL transferee court. Clearly, the federal MDL judge cannot impose co - ordinated management on widely dispersed state courts; it is difficult even to ob - tain and communicate information about such widespread litigation. The greatest need, therefore, is for an information network that could form the basis for vol - untary coordinated action by state court judges to the extent feasible under and consistent with their rules and procedures. The federal judge can serve as a cata - lyst for the development of an information network from which eventually some degree of state–federal coordination may emerge. In some litigation, coordinating committees of state court judges handling related cases have been formed with the support of the State Justice Institute. Such committees, with the help of the federal transferee judge, can serve as a channel of communication. They may also allow the development of a framework for coordination (perhaps including sug - gested forms of orders) to be recommended to the state judges assigned to the litigation in the various states. 828 Coordination may involve inviting state courts to participate in a program for coordinated national discovery while reserving to 825 .

Any coordination plan must take into account that cases in some state courts will reach trial sooner than those in others and needs, therefore, to retain substantial flexibility. It should be possible, however, to reach agreements that will minimize duplicative discovery activity, such as consol idated depositions of experts who will testify in numerous cases and maintaining document depositories. Coordination planning should also take into account that rulings of a single court have the potential of becoming preemptive; for example, the first court to reject a particular privilege claim will cause the material sought to be protected to become available for the entire litigation. 829 31.32 Jurisdictional Conflicts The pendency of related actions in state and federal courts can cause jurisdic - tional complexities and conflicts, leading to requests in the federal court either to stay or dismiss its proceeding or, conversely, to enjoin proceedings in the state court. Generally, federal courts have a duty to exercise their jurisdiction. The mere pendency of parallel or related litigation in state court is not a basis for a refusal to exercise jurisdiction. Discretion to stay or dismiss the federal proceedings ex - ists, however, in a limited number of circumstances. The court may stay its pro - ceedings where a pending state proceeding may decide a pivotal question of state law, the decision of which may obviate the need for the federal court to decide a constitutional issue before it. 830 The court may dismiss an action in the interest of comity where state law claims are alleged and federal court litigation would impair a comprehensive state regulatory scheme. 831 And in exceptional cir - cumstances, the federal court may dismiss an action to avoid piecemeal litigation where the state court has previously acquired jurisdiction of the res and is the more convenient forum. 832 Where the action alleges both federal claims and related state law claims joined on the basis of supplemental jurisdiction, the district court may decline to exercise jurisdiction over a state law claim if the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law, if it substantially predominates over the federal claims, if the district court has dismissed all federal claims, or, in exceptional circumstances, if there are compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction. 833 In making the deci sion 829 .

The federal court’s power to interfere with parallel or related proceedings in state court is limited. The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits federal courts from en - joining or staying proceedings in a state court 834 except as expressly authorized by an Act of Congress, 835 or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments. The exceptions under the Act are narrowly construed. The pendency of a parallel state court action does not warrant issuance of an injunction even though an earlier judgment in that action would be res judi cata in the federal action. 836 Therefore, the fact that persons who fall within the scope of a class certified in a federal court action are maintaining parallel actions in state court does not afford a basis for interference with the state court actions during the pendency of the federal action. In arriving at an appropriate definition of a proposed class, however, the court may want to consider whether it can be drawn so as to avoid unnecessary conflict with state court actions. 837 Courts have used the All Writs Act 838 to effectuate global settlements in large scale litigation. The Act enables the court to issue orders directed to non parties in the pending litigation. 839 Under the Act, courts have enjoined or re moved to federal court parallel state court litigation that would have frustrated comprehensive class settlements approved by the federal court binding on the parties to the state court litigation, 840 or that would have required relitigation in state court of a matter finally decided in federal court. 841 cited therein.

Nevertheless, complex criminal cases—cases involving numer - ous defendants or counts, voluminous evidence, complex or novel issues, unusual public interest, or a lengthy trial—require management. The general principles of early and active judicial involvement, creation of a plan for pretrial and trial, and professionalism of counsel therefore apply to complex criminal litigation as well, although their implementation will generally be different than in civil litigation. This chapter discusses management techniques and practices that have been found useful in complex criminal litigation. As previously pointed out, there is no bright line dividing complex from other criminal cases; much of what is said in this chapter may therefore apply also to cases that may not be considered com - plex.

Effective judicial supervision requires that the judge set the appropriate tone from the outset of the proceedings. This may be accomplished by: • maintaining order and consistency in the conduct of the proceedings; when ground rules are laid down, such as for the filing of papers, the start of the trial day, and the taking of recesses, they should be observed; • conducting the litigation in ways that will instill confidence in all parties that they will get a fair trial; • communicating to the attorneys what the court expects of them and in - sisting on compliance with rules and directions governing the course of the proceedings, particularly when attorneys participating in the case come from other jurisdictions and may be unfamiliar with local practice; 842 . The Federal Judicial Center is working with Judicial Conference committees to assess the need and appropriate focus for such a manual. 843 . In courts in which criminal cases are not assigned to a judge until after arraignment, an individual assignment should nevertheless be specially made upon the filing of an indictment in a complex case. Some courts also have special assignment procedures designed to avoid assignment of complex criminal cases to judges already involved in a lengthy trial. See, e.g., Local General Rule 2.11, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. 844 . In complex cases, the court has discretion, upon making appropriate findings, to extend the time for trial mandated by the Speedy Trial Act. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161–3174. See infra § 32.22."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Criminal Cases 265 • insisting, within the limits demanded by fairness, that the case move ex - peditiously to conclusion; and • encouraging cooperation among counsel; while recognizing counsel’s obligation of zealous advocacy, the court can encourage them to confine themselves to issues that are reasonably disputable and not to assert rights that will have no impact on the outcome but whose exercise can cause delay. In many courts, magistrate judges conduct most pretrial proceedings. In a complex case, the judge should consider whether, and to what extent, to instead conduct those proceedings personally. By holding the initial pretrial conference and hearing applications and motions, the judge will gain valuable early insight into the strategies and personalities of the attorneys and defendants, get a head start on identifying and addressing the issues and problems likely to arise as the case progresses, and save time that might have to be spent reviewing magistrate judges’ rulings. On the other hand, experienced magistrate judges are competent to conduct criminal pretrial proceedings and can thereby free the judge’s time for other pressing commitments. It may be advisable to consider the division of du - ties between judge and magistrate judge on a case-by-case basis to arrive at the most appropriate arrangement for the particular case. While severance of counts and defendants for trial is common in complex cases, it may be advisable to defer that issue and conduct unified pretrial proceed - ings for the entire case. Similarly, where related criminal cases are pending in the court, pretrial proceedings—motion hearings and pretrial conferences—may be coordinated, whether or not the cases will be consolidated for trial. 845 Coordination is facilitated if all such cases in the same court are assigned to a single judge, at least for pretrial purposes. 846 32.12 Representation The Criminal Justice Act (CJA) requires that the court “furnish[] representation for any person financially unable to obtain adequate representation.” 847 845 . Joint pretrial hearings of related criminal and civil cases may also be useful, particularly to deal with the sequence of discovery and trial and to avoid potential conflicts in the proceedings. See supra § 31.2. 846 . Local rules ordinarily provide for assignment of related cases to a single judge, but even in the absence of such assignment, consolidation for limited purposes, such as ruling on challenges to a warrant or wiretap that resulted in multiple indictments, may be feasible. 847 . 18 U.S.C.A. § 3006A(a) (West Supp. 1994). The statute contains detailed provisions as to which “financially eligible” persons must or may be provided representation—those who must be provided representation include all such persons charged with felonies or Class A misdemeanors, while those who may be provided representation include those charged with Class B or C misde - meanors and habeas petitioners.

P. 44 (a) and (b)"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"266 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third “Representation” includes not only counsel, but “investigative, expert and other services necessary for adequate representation.” 848 Making an appointment un der the CJA 849 therefore requires two inquiries for each defendant: first, whether the defendant meets the criteria for financial eligibility, 850 and second, what services beyond those of counsel the defendant may require. Because costs esca late rapidly in complex litigation, the requirements of the Act must be closely observed. The first inquiry is usually conducted without assistance of counsel; in a mul - tidefendant case, each defendant must be questioned separately. If the informa - tion available to the court at the outset is insufficient to determine a defendant’s entitlement conclusively, the court may appoint counsel but reserve the right to charge the defendant with some or all of the fees and costs should it later appear that the defendant is able to pay. In lengthy cases, courts usually approve periodic interim payments to counsel to avoid financial hardship. If fees and the cost of other services authorized by the CJA are expected to be substantial, 851 it is advisable for counsel to submit estimates to the court early in the proceedings. Requests for services by investigators, interpreters, and other nonlawyers should be submitted early for court approval; payments for such ser - vices exceeding the maximum statutory amount (currently $1,000) require certification by the court and approval from the chief judge of the circuit. 852 In some cases, very large fees may be generated; the judge should receive from coun - sel all information necessary to review billings and exercise reasonable control of expenditures. Review of requests for investigatory, expert, or other trial-prepara - tion expenses should usually be conducted ex parte in order to maintain the confidentiality of the defense’s work product. Cases involving non-English-speaking defendants (or defendants suffering from hearing impairment) are likely to require funds to compensate inter- preters. 853 Where non-English-speaking defendants understand the same lan- (dealing with appointment of counsel only); Bench Book, supra note 42, § 1.02 (assignment of counsel or pro se representation). 848 . 18 U.S.C.A. § 3006A(a) (West Supp. 1994). 849 . Although most districts have CJA implementation plans establishing a panel of attor neys eligible for appointment, the publicity generated by some criminal cases may lead attorneys who are not on the panel to seek appointment under the CJA. Appointment of nonpanel attorneys could harm the integrity of the plan and discourage others from serving on the panel. 850 . 18 U.S.C.A. § 3006A(b) (West Supp. 1994). 851 . Id . § 3006A(e).

The ex - tent to which translation will be needed will vary, depending on such factors as the defendant’s competency in English, the level of hearing impairment, and the complexity of the proceedings and testimony. The court has broad discretion over the manner in which interpreters are used, so long as the fairness of the trial is preserved. 856 The CJA directs that the court “shall appoint separate counsel for persons having interests that cannot properly be represented by the same counsel.” 857 When two or more defendants who are jointly charged or joined for trial are rep - resented by the same counsel or counsel associated in the practice of law (whether appointed under the CJA or not), the court is required under Fed. R. Crim. P. 44(c) to “promptly inquire” about the joint representation, “personally advise each defendant of the right to . . . separate representation,” and, unless no conflict is likely to arise, “take such measures as may be appropriate to protect each de - fendant’s right to counsel.” 858 Although the rule does not specify the procedure, case law generally requires a “searching inquiry” on the record in which the judge (1) personally advises each defendant of the potential dangers of joint representa - tion, (2) allows the defendants to question the court as to the nature and conse - quences of joint representation, and, most importantly, (3) elicits a narrative re - sponse from each defendant (as opposed to simple assent to a series of questions from the bench) establishing that he or she has been advised of his or her rights, understands the potential conflict and its possible dangers, and voluntarily waives his or her rights in this regard in clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous words af - ter consultation with his or her attorney or another counsel. 859 For specifics, the 854 .

When a corporation or other business entity is a defendant, the same attor - ney should not ordinarily represent the entity and individual officers.

This inquiry is necessary even if the case is not going to trial 861 or the defendants initially consent to the joint repre - sentation. 862 Though substantial deference should be paid to defendants’ right to counsel of their choice, the court may prohibit joint representation presenting a substantial possibility of conflict of interest even if the defendant waives the right to conflict-free representation. 863 Such possible conflicts of interest may arise in a variety of contexts, including where an attorney has represented multi ple clients during a grand jury investigations where an attorney’s former client is a codefendant or potential witness, 864 and where an attorney received privileged information as the result of a joint defense agreement with a codefendant or po - tential witness. 865 In multiparty cases the court needs to consider whether to call on defense counsel to organize themselves for pretrial and trial; the use of lead and liaison counsel furthers the efficient and economical conduct of the litigation but may be inadvisable in a criminal case in the face of objection by a party. 866 It may, how - ever, be possible for counsel to avoid duplicate work by dividing various trial preparation tasks, such as reviewing or translating documents, listening to and transcribing tapes, interviewing witnesses, conducting investigations, preparing expert testimony, and preparing demonstrative evidence for use at trial. 867 Where appropriate, defense motions should be filed jointly, avoiding the prepa ration of duplicate paper work.

Ethical rules generally prohibit attorneys from communicating with a represented adverse party about the subject matter of the representation without the consent of that party’s attorney. 879 Circumstances may arise in criminal cases, however, that make it imperative for a defendant to seek to communicate directly with the prosecution. 880 When such a situation arises, it should be promptly brought to the judge’s attention. To pro tect the defendant’s legitimate interests, the judge should probably question the defendant about his or her unwillingness to be represented by current defense counsel during the communication with the prosecution, and ensure that this decision is not the product of coercion or other improper influences. Depending on the results of this questioning, the judge may direct the prosecution not to confer with the defendant until new counsel, even if only temporary, has been se - cured. If the judge finds that improper communications between the prosecution and a defendant have already occurred, sanctions may be appropriate, such as suppression of evidence obtained through the improper contact, reprimand of the prosecutor or a contempt citation, reference to the state bar for possible dis - ciplinary proceedings, request for appropriate action by the Department of Justice, or, in an extreme case, dismissal of the indictment. 881 878 .

Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1 authorizes the judge, at any time after the filing of an indictment, to order one or more conferences “to consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.” 882 This is the judge’s first opportunity to organize the case and set the tone for its conduct, as previously discussed. 883 In addition to establishing a schedule and addressing the various pretrial issues dis - cussed below, the following matters may be considered: • calling on the prosecution to describe succinctly the substance of the charges and substance of the evidence against defendants, the nature of discovery materials, the estimated length of trial, and anticipated proce - dural problems; and to identify any related cases; and inviting defense counsel to do the same to the extent they are willing; • beginning the process of identifying and narrowing issues; • inviting counsel to submit stipulations on uncontested matters before trial (e.g., that a bank is a national bank, that the handwriting is the de - fendant’s, that commerce is involved, or that a substance is what it is al - leged to be); • inviting recommendations or proposals from counsel for the manage - ment of the case; • advising counsel of standing orders or special procedures that will apply to the case; • where attorneys participating in the case are from outside the jurisdiction or are unfamiliar with federal court procedure, alerting them to critical 882 . Although by its terms the rule applies only if the defendant is represented by counsel, courts schedule pretrial conferences in cases where defendants represent themselves. In such cases, no sanctions should be imposed for nonattendance, nor any attempt made to obtain stipulations. 883 .

R. Crim. P. 43(c)(3) pro vides that a defendant need not be present “at a conference or argument upon a question of law,” and a defendant may specifically waive attendance, it is generally inadvisable to hold a conference in the absence of a defendant. Even a conference intended only to address a point of law might lead to a discussion at which the defendant should be present. If the defendant is in pretrial detention, arrange - ments for conferences need to be made so as to minimize the complications and delays involved in transporting him to the courthouse; advance notice to and co - ordination with the marshal are advisable as well as efforts to have the defendant held at a nearby location. Security and space considerations will often make it advisable, especially in multidefendant cases, to hold conferences in the court - room rather than in chambers. Arrangements must also be made to permit pri - vate consultation between defendants and their attorneys or among counsel. All conferences should be held on the record to avoid later confusion or dis - agreement and to preserve a record for appellate review. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1 re - quires that the court, at the conclusion of every pretrial conference, prepare and file a memorandum of all matters agreed on. The court has broad authority to is - sue orders “not inconsistent with” the federal and local rules that will expedite the litigation. 887 884 . The court should also be alert to any sign that counsel may fail to meet minimum stan dards of competent representation satisfying the Sixth Amendment. McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 (1970). Signs of possible inadequacy include lack of preparation, failure to make ap - propriate requests to the prosecution for exculpatory materials, and failure to preserve important rights of the defendant. William W Schwarzer, Dealing with Incompetent Counsel—The Trial Judge’s Role , 93 Harv. L. Rev. 633, 656–58 (1980).

The complexity of a case is a relevant consideration in establishing a fair schedule for pretrial and trial, but it is not a license for automatic and indefinite delay. If the case is to move expeditiously to conclusion, it is essential that the court establish a schedule for all important events at the initial conference, or in any event as early as possible, and enforce compliance with it. The schedule should be established only after consultation with counsel. In complex cases in - volving a number of criminal defense attorneys, the court will inevitably have to accommodate various conflicting commitments. 889 Once the schedule has been worked out, however, counsel should understand that they will be bound by it and no continuances will be granted for personal or professional conflicts. The following matters should be considered in establishing the schedule: • Setting a firm trial date—when that is not feasible at the early conference because not enough is known about the case, a date should at least be fixed for the setting of a trial date. • Setting firm dates for the filing and hearing of motions—different dates may be set for different motions (in limine motions, for example, may be filed in connection with the final pretrial conference), and a terminal date may be set at which time all motions not filed are deemed waived. • Setting a firm date for the delivery of discovery by the respective parties — generally disclosure should be made by the government soon after the ar - raignment to enable the defendant to prepare his defense and evaluate any proffered plea agreement (see infra section 32.24). • Setting a firm date for giving notice of any defense based on alibi, mental condition, or public authority. 890 32.23 Pretrial Hearings Evidentiary hearings on motions should ordinarily be scheduled well in advance of trial, particularly those that may take substantial time to hear or that, if granted, will significantly affect the scope or course of trial.

If the motion is decided in favor of the defendant, an appeal may be taken by the prosecution with little or no delay of the trial. If the motion is decided in favor of the prose - cution, the defendant can enter a conditional guilty plea under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2), preserving the right to appeal the ruling. Pretrial hearings on motions in limine under Fed. R. Evid. 104 enable the court to rule on various evidentiary is - sues, such as the use of convictions under Fed. R. Evid. 609 and evidence of other acts under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), and (in rare cases) the admissibility of coconspir - ator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), thereby streamlining the trial. 891 Pretrial rulings on pivotal evidentiary issues are facilitated if the prose - cution is required to give advance notice of its intent to offer such evidence, along with a supporting memorandum. Addressing these issues before trial allows the judge and attorneys to give them more deliberate consideration than during trial, although it may be impossible to decide certain issues, such as relevance, without taking into account evidence received at trial and the posture of the parties at that time. 892 If pretrial rulings are made, the court should indicate whether they are final (not renewable at trial) or provisional (subject to modification or requiring formal renewal at trial as a condition to any claim of error). Pretrial hearings are also an appropriate occasion for receiving status reports from counsel, inquiring about the progress of the various phases of the case, such as production of discovery material, monitoring the government’s compliance with its obligations to produce exculpatory and other material matter, determin - ing whether any problems have arisen affecting the schedule for the case, and reminding counsel of upcoming scheduled events in the case. 32.24 Discovery Pretrial discovery in criminal cases, unlike that available in civil litigation, is lim - ited. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 requires the government on request to produce state - ments of the defendant and his criminal record; on request the government must also produce relevant documents and tangible objects, reports of examinations and tests, and a summary of the prospective testimony of expert witnesses, but such a request obligates the defense to make reciprocal disclosure. 893 A motion for 891 .

Although involuntary discovery from parties in criminal cases is limited, broad disclosure is possible if the parties consent. For example, the Jencks Act does not prevent the voluntary early production of the statements of prosecution witnesses; prosecutors can generally be persuaded to make early production since, by giving the defense an opportunity to prepare, it will avoid interruptions at trial and may lead to a plea. As an inducement to broadened pretrial discovery, the de - fense may be willing to agree not to raise objections regarding authenticity or to contest certain readily provable facts (e.g., interstate commerce; see supra section 32.21). Such issues can be resolved without formal motions at a pretrial hear - ing—called an “omnibus hearing” in some districts. In many districts the U.S. Attorney, frequently at the urging of the court, has adopted an “open file” policy for most criminal cases. Other courts by local rule require counsel to meet and exchange discoverable information before filing pretrial motions. The judge should encourage such voluntary disclosures, subject to the defen - dant’s right not to commit to a defense until the end of the prosecution’s case. Voluntary disclosure, and often exchange, is particularly appropriate in cases charging “white collar” crimes, such as securities fraud or antitrust violations, that typically involve voluminous documents and accounting and other technical data. Discovery in such cases may be managed much as it is in complex civil liti - gation, with the court taking early and active control. 900 The parties should produce documents, including indexes and other finding guides, in a manner that will facilitate efficient review. The court should set an early date by which each party must identify the exhibits it intends to use in its case in chief, with addi - tional exhibits allowed subsequently for good cause only. In producing docu - ments pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(c) that are “material to the preparation” of the defense, the prosecution may be asked to separately identify those materials it will use and those it may use at trial. While all relevant documents should be pro - duced, excessive production may hamper the defense by burying it under marginally relevant material. Documents should be marked for production and consecutively numbered to prevent later disputes over whether a document was produced. In the absence of cooperation by the government, the judge needs to take steps to ensure that the defendant’s rights to disclosure are observed in meaning - ful ways. The defendant is entitled to the timely production of exculpatory and other material matter in the government’s possession that will assist in the prepa - ration of the defense, and judicial oversight may be necessary to ensure that the 900 . See supra § 21.4."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Criminal Cases 277 government complies with its obligation. 901 The judge may enter a specific or der requiring the government to produce all such materials and specifying the date for compliance. 902 The court may also, in the exercise of its inherent su pervisory power, require the prosecution to provide lists of witnesses and exhibits in advance of trial. 903 Early disclosure of such materials is important because it may be critical to the defendant’s strategic decisions. Because the government often establishes a deadline for the acceptance of a proffered plea bargain, fairness requires that the disclosure to which defendant is entitled be made in a timely manner. Moreover, such disclosure facilitates counsel’s preparation for trial and avoids unnecessary work. It will also enable the judge to conduct a more effective pretrial conference, which can eliminate unnecessary witnesses, encourage stipu - lations, and generally streamline the trial. Under the Jencks Act, both the prosecution and the defense are required to produce all witness statements that relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified. Although the government is under no duty to produce the material before the witness has testified, many prosecutors will do so, particu - larly when urged by the court and given to understand how denying the defen - dant a recess to examine a statement until after the direct testimony of each af - 901 . Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), requires the prosecution to disclose exculpatory and other material evidence upon specific request from the defense. United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), extended this requirement to cases where the defense has made no request or only a general request for Brady material. In United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), a majority of the Court adopted a unified test of materiality for specific, general and no request cases, requiring dis closure whenever there is a “reasonable probability” that the evidence would affect the result of the proceeding; the existence of a specific request may, however, be relevant to this analysis. See 2 Wayne R. LaFave & Jerold H. Isreal, Criminal Procedure § 19.5 at 181–83 (West Supp. 1991). The disclosure requirement extends to matters affecting the credibility of key prosecution witnesses, such as inducements given to obtain their testimony. See Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676–77; Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972). The judge should caution the prosecution that failure to comply with its disclosure obligations may result in a mistrial or dismissal, even where extensive time and effort have already been expended. See, e.g., United States v. Boyd, 833 F. Supp. 1277 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (granting new trials after multiyear prosecutions primarily on ground of failure to disclose inducements given to government witnesses). Prosecutors should resolve doubts in favor of disclo - sure or consult with the judge. See Agurs, 427 U.S. at 108, and other cases cited in Manual on Recurring Problems in Criminal Trials, supra note 870, § III(B)(2). 902 . The court has the authority to direct when Brady material must be disclosed. United States v. Starusko, 729 F.2d 256, 261 (3d Cir. 1984). The government should make disclosure in time “to allow the defense to use the favorable material effectively in the preparation and presentation of its case.” United States v. Pollack, 534 F.2d 964, 973 (D.C. Cir. 1976). For additional case law on the timing of disclosure of Brady material, see Manual on Recurring Problems in Criminal Trials, supra note 870, § III(B)(4). 903 . See, e.g., United States v. Napue, 834 F.2d 1311, 1318 (7th Cir. 1987); United States v.

Discovery in criminal cases should be coordinated with that in related civil litigation. 905 As discussed in supra section 31.2, a stay of some discovery in the civil litigation will sometimes be needed. The prosecution may ask the court try - ing the civil case to stay discovery to prevent defendants from taking advantage of it in the criminal case. Similarly, the defense may ask the court to stay the civil case to avoid the prejudice of having to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege during the pendency of the criminal case. The discovery available in civil cases may, however, occasionally be used to obtain information that will allow the re - lated criminal proceedings to be conducted more effectively and efficiently. 32.25 Electronic Surveillance Complex criminal cases frequently involve extensive electronic surveillance. The legality of the surveillance and the admissibility of its product must be deter - mined by pretrial motions. 906 The government should promptly produce all underlying documentation necessary to determine whether the surveillance was properly authorized and conducted. If the same surveillance material is at issue in more than one case, the court should consider consolidation of the motion hear - ings. Extensive electronic surveillance presents significant logistical problems, par - ticularly in multidefendant cases and cases involving non-English speaking de - fendants. Defense counsel must be given adequate time to review the prosecu - tion’s recordings. In order to expedite trial preparation, the prosecution should identify as soon as possible conversations that it anticipates offering at trial and promptly make available logs or indices identifying the participants and any de - fendants the government contends are referred to or mentioned. Defense counsel should coordinate and divide the responsibility of reviewing and transcribing the tapes. The prosecution should also promptly produce transcripts of any recordings it expects to present at trial, upon defendants’ agreement that any differences 904 . See United States v. Minsky, 963 F.2d 870, 876 (6th Cir. 1992) (while government can not be required to make early disclosure of Jencks Act material, it should nevertheless do so to allow defense opportunity to review undisputed material and court to rule on remainder). 905 . See supra §§ 21.455, 31.2. 906 .

The parties should be asked to reach agreement in advance of trial on the text of transcripts, including the proper translation of any material in a for - eign language. Only to the extent that there are material disagreements should multiple versions be presented at trial. The process of reviewing tapes and pro - ducing transcripts may be quite lengthy. 907 Prior to trial, tapes and transcripts should be organized for quick reference and efficient presentation. Entering transcripts into a computer database, for ex - ample, facilitates finding particular words or names. The equipment to be used for jury presentation should be tested in advance of trial to eliminate any glitches. Stipulations should be sought as to chain of custody and foundation. 32.26 Classified Information The Classified Information Procedures Act 908 defines classified information and establishes procedures for cases potentially involving such information. After filing of the indictment, any party may move under the Act for a pretrial confer - ence to consider matters relating to classified information. Following such a mo - tion, or upon its own motion, the court must then “promptly” hold such a con - ference. 909 At this conference, the judge must establish the timing of (1) re quests for discovery, (2) defendant’s required giving of notice of intent to disclose classified information, 910 and (3) the commencement of the procedure under section 6 of the Act (discussed below) for reviewing and ruling on evidence in - volving classified information. 911 The court should also take steps to obtain ex - pedited security clearances for the defendants, their attorneys, and court person - nel (clearance is not required for the judge and jurors). 912 Once it is established that classified information issues will arise, the Department of Justice will appoint a court security officer, who will work with the court and parties on security mat - 907 . Even recordings in a foreign language should, upon a party’s request, be played for the jury, since the tone of a conversation may have evidentiary value. The jury can evaluate, for exam ple, whether a statement reported in a transcript was made jokingly. The judge should ask the jurors whether any of them understand the foreign language. See Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (no violation of Batson where attorney exercised peremptory challenges against Spanish- speaking jurors indicating possible difficulty in following official translation, but might be imper - missible to challenge all jurors who understand the language at issue); Pemberthy v. Beyer, 19 F.3d 857 (3d Cir. 1994) (permissible to use peremptory challenges against Spanish-speaking jurors).

Although this may run counter to the court’s preference to rule on admissibility in context at trial, it allows the gov - ernment to evaluate the classified information “costs” of proceeding with a par - ticular prosecution.

Such severe measures should be avoided, however, if more traditional measures, such as extensive voir dire, jury sequestration, continuance, or change of venue, will be adequate. 924 Court should utilize the least restrictive measures adequate for the purpose to avoid First Amendment problems and maintain public confidence in the fairness and openness of judicial proceedings. Criminal proceedings generally may not be closed to the public. 925 The court may order closure only in the rare case where an “overriding interest” ex ists, supported by specific findings made on the record, and no alternative will suffice. 926 The law is more tolerant, however, of orders prohibiting extrajudicial state - ments concerning the proceedings by attorneys, court personnel, parties, wit - nesses, and law enforcement officials involved in the case.

To avoid prejudice re - sulting from attorneys’ comments to the media, the court may consider imposing guidelines limiting such comments and suggesting appropriate responses to im - promptu questioning by the media as well as ground rules for scheduled press conferences.

If the judge finds it necessary to issue an order restricting attorneys’ speech, it must be narrowly drawn. The general standard for restraint of attorney speech allows the court to prohibit only speech that “will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing” the proceeding. 929 Statements falling into this category include comments on: • the prior criminal record of a suspect or defendant; • the character or reputation of a suspect or defendant; • an attorney’s opinion on the guilt of a suspect or defendant, the merits of a case, or the evidence presented; • the existence or contents of any admission, confession, or statement of a suspect or defendant, or the refusal or failure to make a statement; • the results of examinations or tests administered, or the refusal to submit to them; • the identity, testimony, or credibility of prospective witnesses; 927 .

Ordinarily it is best for the court to communicate with the public only through statements and rulings on the record. 32.28 Severance and Joinder Complex cases are frequently brought on indictments that join numerous counts and defendants. Improperly joined counts or defendants are subject to severance under Fed. R. Crim. P. 8. But the judge may also determine that severance is ap - propriate 937 when the multiplicity of defendants, counts, evidence, and neces sary instructions would jeopardize the jury’s ability to comprehend and deal sepa - rately with each defendant’s case, make it difficult for the court to conduct a fair and efficient trial, 938 or result in an excessively long, costly, and cumbersome trial. The prosecution may, at the judge’s suggestion, be willing to sever counts and defendants, particularly where the outcome of the first trial may determine the disposition of severed counts and defendants, through dismissal or plea bar- gains. 939 Severance is appropriate of peripheral defendants, against whom the charges are narrow, and who should not fairly be required to prepare for and at - tend a long trial. Severing particular defendants or counts can reduce the cost and time required to prepare for trial, and the presence of fewer defendants and at - torneys can expedite the trial. 940 Conversely, separate criminal cases may be joined for trial under Fed. R. Cr. P. 13 “if the offenses, and the defendants if there is more than one, could have been joined in a single indictment.” In combination with the power to sever, this enables the court to structure the case for the efficient trial of related indict- ments. 941 937 . The law of the circuit needs to be consulted. Generally, granting of a severance is committed to the discretion of the court. United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d Cir. 1989); United States v. Lurz, 666 F.2d 69, 77 (4th Cir. 1981). The court may order severance even if the counts or defendants were properly joined under Rule 8 and applicable case law. See United States v. Andrews, 754 F. Supp. 1161 (N.D. Ill. 1990); United States v. Shea, 750 F. Supp. 46 (D. Mass. 1990). For a discussion of procedures and standards to be used in determining whether to sever, see Casamento , 887 F.2d at 1151–53. 938 .

United States 942 would normally call for severance of de- fendants, the court may try the case with separately impaneled juries. 943 Most of the evidence will be heard at the same time by both juries, sitting separately in the same courtroom. The jury considering the charges against a defendant implicated by the confession of a nontestifying codefendant is excused from the courtroom when evidence of that confession is presented. 944 Although this may take extra time at trial, elimination of the need to conduct separate trials may result in net savings. 32.3 Trial .31 Physical Arrangements and Security 286 .32 Jury Selection 288 .33 Managing the Trial 292 .34 Sentencing Hearings 297 32.31 Physical Arrangements and Security Complex criminal cases will often create a need to accommodate a large number of defendants and counsel, a high degree of public and media interest, and secu - rity concerns. This may require substantial changes in the physical arrangements of the courthouse and courtroom and in the court’s routine procedures. Plans for physical changes should be made well in advance of trial. 945 Similarly, plans for accommodating the public and media and for dealing with security concerns should be in place before the trial begins. Some aspects of such plans may be in - corporated in a court order. 946 Some relevant considerations are the following: • Courtroom seating of defendants in multidefendant cases should take into account security concerns and minimizing of disruptions. If there are many defendants and counsel, name signs may be placed on the tables except when in-court identifications will be made. 947 Arrangements may have to be made for secure and private conference facilities for de - fendants and counsel, and for secure witness waiting rooms.

Artists making sketches should be located so they do not distract the jury and, if the jury is anonymous, admonished not to sketch jurors. • In multidefendant cases, special arrangements may be needed for trans - porting defendants in custody to and from the courtroom and holding them during recesses in order to ensure their timely appearance in court. Handling large numbers of incarcerated defendants can result in trial de - lays unless adequate provision is made. • Cases involving defendants charged with violent or violence-related crimes require special attention to security issues. 948 A security plan should be prepared to deal both with routine procedures and with con - tingencies (such as the need to evacuate in case of emergency). 949 The plan should be prepared in consultation with the court’s security com - mittee, the marshal, and other court personnel concerned, as well as with counsel for the parties. Following are some of the issues relevant to a se - curity plan: –the identity of persons and agencies having specified responsibilities; –the identity of persons to be contacted in the event of particular con - tingencies; –lines of communication for participants in the security plan; –plans for dealing with disruptions by spectators or defendants; –provisions for reporting and dealing with threats to trial participants; –the need for particular security features in the courtroom (such as bullet-proof shields); –the availability of operative alarms; –the availability of adequate communication facilities; –coordination with local law enforcement authorities; –the availability of security personnel in sufficient numbers; –the adequacy of equipment and facilities to screen for bombs and firearms; and –the availability of video and other monitoring devices for public ar - eas. 948 . While safety is the overriding concern, the court should be aware that highly visible and extensive security measures may prejudice the defendants’ right to a fair trial by leading jurors to believe that the accused are known to be violent and dangerous.

Indeed, an otherwise ordinary criminal case may become complex because of the publicity generated by the facts or per - sonalities involved. This may require a large pool of prospective jurors and painstaking examination of the individuals. Some of the considerations in the management of jury selection follow: • Jury questionnaires are frequently used to eliminate from the jury pool persons who will obviously have to be excused for disqualification, hard - ship, or inability to serve in a long trial. 952 The responses will also be helpful to counsel in preparing for voir dire of individual jurors and the exercise of peremptory challenges. Pretrial distribution of questionnaires may, however, tend to produce an excessive number of requests to be ex - cused and failures to appear. One alternative is to have jurors complete such questionnaires at the courthouse after they have reported for service 950 . Jurors can be instructed that security procedures are a normal part of trials and that they should not draw any inferences adverse to defendants. 951 . See generally Bench Book, supra note 42, § 1.13 (Supp. July 1993). 952 . For a sample questionnaire, see Litigation Manual, supra note 5, Sample Form 37 at 317."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Criminal Cases 289 and have received preliminary instructions from the judge about the case. Another alternative is to simply give potential jurors a list of questions that will be asked on voir dire, to allow them time to prepare to answer. Whatever approach is used, attorneys should be consulted about the in - strument to be used and given an opportunity to make suggestions and objections. • Voir dire may be and generally is conducted by the judge, although many judges permit counsel to supplement the court’s questions. 953 Counsel should be asked to submit proposed voir dire questions; where counsel conduct the examination, reasonable time limits may be imposed. The jurors should receive information about the case before voir dire to en - able them to give more informed responses. 954 Probing for bias, espe cially in a high publicity case, requires care and patience. Perfunctory catch-all questions (e.g., “Do you believe that you can be fair and impar tial?”) cannot be depended on to be effective. Many judges believe that eliciting narrative answers at least on some important points is necessary. Where the case has received extensive publicity, it may be advisable to question jurors at the outset about their exposure and reaction to it to eliminate quickly those disqualified from serving; 955 follow-up ques tioning of those who have been exposed may be conducted individually in chambers. 956 Jurors are not automatically disqualified for having read or heard about a case (any more than they are for holding opinions about drugs or crime); circuit law needs to be consulted on the control ling standards. • Where a long trial is expected, jurors should be advised at the start of voir dire of the anticipated schedule to eliminate early those unable to serve. • The decisions in Batson v. Kentucky 957 and its progeny barring the dis - criminatory exercise of peremptory challenges have complicated jury se - lection. If the defendant makes a prima facie showing in objecting to a challenge, the burden shifts to the government to set forth a reasonably specific race and gender-neutral explanation for its challenge.

When the possibility of such a challenge exists, the court or deputy clerk may want to keep a running tally identifying jurors who have been ex - cused by the parties. • The court must impanel twelve jurors, 958 and may impanel up to six alternates to replace those who are excused or disqualified before the jury retires to deliberate. 959 How many alternates to seat will depend on the judge’s experience with juries under similar circumstances, considering the estimated length of the trial, the time of the year and the incidence of sickness, and other potential causes of interference. While avoiding mis - trial is a prime consideration, the court needs also to consider the bur - dens imposed on alternate jurors, the drain of available jurors for other trials, and the cost of the additional jurors. • In some high-profile cases, judges, instead of sequestering the jury, have adopted the less onerous option of seating an anonymous jury. Anonymity helps protect the jurors’ safety and privacy, 960 but may in - timidate jurors and complicate voir dire. Factors relevant to the determi - nation whether an anonymous jury is necessary include (1) whether any defendant has participated in “dangerous and unscrupulous conduct,” (2) whether there is evidence of a past attempt by any defendant to inter - fere with the judicial process, and (3) the extent of pretrial publicity and the possibility that the jurors’ identities will become public. 961 To main - tain anonymity, potential jurors are identified only by a preassigned number. The attorneys are given lists cross-referencing these numbers with the jurors’ questionnaire responses, including only that information necessary for voir dire. 962 The number of lists cross-referencing juror numbers with jurors’ names and addresses should be kept to a minimum 958 .

At the courthouse their movements need to be controlled so as to avoid contact with the public and to protect their anonymity. Managing such a jury is complicated and requires advance planning. • Only in rare cases, when the court concludes that no alternative will sufficiently protect jurors’ security and shield them from improper influence, are juries sequestered. 965 The decision should be made well in advance of trial to give the marshal time to make the arrangements for lodging, meals, transportation, and security. 966 Particularly in long trials, attention needs to be given to such matters as recreation, family contacts, emergencies, medical care, and personality conflicts. 967 A less intrusive alternative is limited sequestration. Although the jury is not held overnight, they are sequestered while at the courthouse, provided with a private dining area, and escorted to and from the courtroom. When jurors are sequestered, they should be cautioned against drawing adverse inferences. 968 • Once the jury is impaneled, no matter what procedures are adopted, care should be taken that the jurors receive proper treatment from responsible court personnel. Jury service in lengthy cases is particularly arduous and requires personal sacrifices from jurors. It is well for the court to com - municate to jurors the court’s and parties’ appreciation for their service; some judges visit the jury room after the verdict has been returned and thank jurors personally. Jurors should be reminded of the important role they are playing in the justice process. Their needs should be accommo - dated to the extent feasible and courtesy and consideration shown by court personnel in contact with them. As elsewhere discussed, the pro - 963 .

Jurors should not be kept waiting and interruptions requiring them to be excused from the courtroom should be avoided. 32.33 Managing the Trial Because of the high stakes involved, criminal trials will generally be more hard - fought and sometimes more contentious than civil trials and therefore present challenging management problems for the judge. Fairness to the participants in the process—as well as to the jurors—requires that such trials be conducted in an orderly and expeditious fashion. Although criminal trials require greater circum - spection in the exercise of judicial control than civil trials, the judge should not hesitate to exercise such control as is necessary to maintain order and momen - tum. Unless the judge does so, such a trial may take on a life of its own, jeopardiz - ing due process rights and imposing unreasonable costs and burdens. This section discusses problems that commonly arise in connection with complex criminal trials. Reference should also be made to the discussion of relevant generic issues affecting the conduct of trials in complex cases, in supra sections 22.13–22.15, 22.21–22.23, 22.31–22.32, and 22.42–22.43. • Expediting the trial. The seriousness of the issues at stake may lead the attorneys to try the case leaving no stone unturned. This requires the judge to assert and retain control of the proceedings in order to move them to an expeditious conclusion (see supra sections 32.11, 32.22). The trial schedule is an important aspect of that control; some judges believe that a full trial day, with no unnecessary interruptions, for as many days each week as possible, is effective. Others schedule trials from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. each day, giving them time to attend to other important mat - ters. Whatever the schedule, interruptions should be avoided; evidentiary or other problems can usually be taken up during recesses or in confer - ences at the start or the end of the trial day instead of at sidebar confer - ences or special recesses. Hearings on motions during the trial should be scheduled so as not to interrupt the trial. A conference at the end of each trial day is useful also to address problems arising during the trial and to plan the witnesses and exhibits for the next day, making for a well - prepared and orderly trial. • Defendants and witnesses in custody. Courtroom security arrangements appropriate for the defendants (and occasionally witnesses) need to be made with the marshal, taking into account the magnitude of the risk presented. Incarcerated defendants are usually escorted to their seats be - fore the jury is brought into the courtroom and not removed until after the jury has been excused. If shackles are used, they should be concealed. Deputy marshals in attendance should also be as unobtrusive as possible"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Criminal Cases 293 (some judges have them remove their badges). 969 Security precautions, because they may create a risk of prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial, should be no more visible than necessary. 970 • Cumulative evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 611 directs the court to “exercise rea - sonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses . . . to . . . avoid needless consumption of time.” Unnecessary witnesses and ex - hibits should be eliminated as much as possible during pretrial; some may, however, become unnecessary only after developments at trial. The judge should exclude witnesses or exhibits that are obviously redundant or otherwise unnecessary, and should curtail redundant and needlessly lengthy interrogation. • Recalcitrant witnesses. When a witness refuses to testify, the grounds for the refusal, whether a Fifth Amendment claim or other ground, need to be established on the record outside the hearing of the jury. To the extent possible, counsel should inform the judge of such a claim in advance so that the proceedings can be scheduled without interrupting the trial. 971 It is improper for counsel knowingly to cause a witness to invoke the Fifth Amendment before the jury. • Absence of defendant or counsel. The absence of any one of the defen - dants and attorneys in a complex criminal trial can cause serious and costly disruptions. Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 43, a defendant may waive his right to be present at the trial, except at the impaneling of the jury and re - turn of the verdict. Such a waiver should not be accepted, however, unless genuinely voluntary. When a defendant is absent, the court should at - tempt to discover the explanation before deciding whether to proceed. Similarly, an attorney’s unexplained or unavoidable absence may require a delay in the trial. In multidefendant cases, however, a defendant and his counsel may be excused from phases of the trial not affecting that defen - dant, with appropriate explanation given to the jury. • Absence of juror during trial. Whether a juror who fails to appear or asks to be excused during the trial should be replaced by an alternate is a difficult call. It is best to conserve alternates in the early stages of the trial. Moreover, fairness to the juror and possibly the parties requires that the 969 . See United States v. Ferguson, 758 F.2d 843, 854 (2d Cir. 1985). 970 . See Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560 (1986). In the rare case where the judge allows the defendant to be dressed in a manner that reveals the fact of incarceration, the reasons therefor should be stated on the record, and the jury advised to draw no adverse inference. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Trial by Jury, Standard 15-3.2 (approved draft, August 1993). 971 . See Bench Book supra note 42, §§ 3.05–3.06."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"294 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third judge not be too quick to replace a juror who may only briefly be un - available. • Publicity during trial. If potentially prejudicial publicity appears during the trial, the judge will need to consider three steps: (1) determine whether the article or broadcast could have a prejudicial effect on jurors; (2) determine whether any of the jurors saw or heard it; and (3) question any exposed juror individually about how it affected the juror, whether he or she discussed it with others, and whether it might affect the juror’s ability to be fair and impartial. The judge will then need to consider whether to excuse the juror and, in any event, whether to give a caution - ary instruction. Similar steps need to be taken where an attempt has been made to communicate with a juror or the juror has heard something touching the case. • Guilty pleas during trial. In a multidefendant case, a defendant’s plea should be taken outside the presence of the jury and at a time when it will not interrupt the trial. The defendant should continue to participate in the trial until the plea has actually been entered. The jury should be ap - propriately instructed not to speculate about the absence of the defendant from the trial and to ignore evidence received against that defendant only. • Improper behavior by the defendants, attorneys, or others. While ade - quate latitude must be given for vigorous advocacy 972 and reasonable allowance made for the stress placed on all participants by the trial, the judge needs to deal promptly with improper behavior, taking what steps are necessary to maintain order while avoiding overreaction to offensive conduct. For relatively minor improprieties, particularly those due to ig - norance or misunderstanding, a mild admonition and explanation of the required standards of conduct—given outside the hearing of the jury— will usually suffice. 973 For repeated or deliberate misconduct, the court should consider more severe measures, including citing the individual for contempt. 974 In the event of courtroom disturbances that must be dealt with immediately to preserve order and prevent disruption of the pro - 972 . See In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 236 (1962). 973 .

See 18 U.S.C. § 401; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 42; Bench Book, supra note 42, § 1.24 (criminal contempt).

See McConnell , 370 U.S. at 236; Pennsylvania v.

In unusually lengthy and complex cases, an ex - pedited transcript may be valuable to counsel in preparing for cross - examination and for the examination of later witnesses, to the jurors in refreshing their memories about the testimony, 977 and to the court in avoiding delays if there are post-trial motions or appeals. However, daily or expedited copy is costly and will not necessarily be approved under the CJA. 978 If the court chooses to order expedited transcripts, it may order payment for daily copy under section 3006A of the CJA if such transcripts are needed by defense counsel. If expedited copy is requested by someone other than counsel appointed under the CJA, the CJA counsel are entitled to copies at the copy rate. 979 • Loss of a juror after deliberations have begun. To avoid a mistrial, 980 the parties may stipulate to a verdict by a jury of fewer than twelve. Even in the absence of a stipulation, the court under Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b) may excuse a juror for just cause during deliberations and receive a ver dict by the eleven remaining jurors. Ordinarily the court should not do so except where the trial has been lengthy and a mistrial would be costly; if the 975 . The maximum punishment for summary contempt is six months’ imprisonment. See Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506 (1974). If the misconduct involves contemptuous remarks directed toward the trial judge personally, but does not merit immediate punishment, the contempt proceedings should be conducted before another judge.

If such problems are anticipated, or if the defen dant’s absence may be prolonged, arrangements may be made for a remote loudspeaker or closed-circuit television in order to keep the defendant informed about the proceedings. The court should advise the defendant of his right to return to the courtroom upon an agreement to behave properly. See Scurr v. Moore, 647 F.2d 854, 858 & n.5 (8th Cir. 1981). 977 .

If the full jury had reached a verdict as to any defendant before the juror was lost, the judge may accept that verdict, 981 but should not announce it until all deliberations have con- cluded. 982 • Recall of alternate juror. Although Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(c) provides that alternate jurors “shall be discharged” when the jury retires to deliberate, some circuits have upheld the use of alternates to replace jurors during deliberations. 983 Others have held that this is permissible only if the defendant expressly and knowingly consents. 984 If an alternate juror is recalled and substituted after deliberations have begun, 985 the judge must instruct the jury to begin deliberations anew, starting with election of a foreperson. To prepare for this eventuality, the court may instruct alternate jurors before discharging them that, because they may be re - called, they remain subject to the constraints imposed on them at trial until deliberations have concluded. • Readback of testimony. When the jury requests a readback, the court should take care to avoid giving undue emphasis to particular testi- mony. 986 Generally, only the portion of the transcript agreed to by the parties should be read. • Return of the jury’s verdict. In cases where the return of the verdict may be expected to provoke a strong emotional response in the courtroom or 981 . Fed. R. Crim.

Phillips, 664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1981); but see United States v. Lamb, 529 F.2d 1153 (9th Cir. 1975). Alternate jurors who are not replacing other jurors should not be present during deliberations, but violation of this rule is not “plain error” under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), and is therefore not cognizable when raised for the first time on appeal. United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (1993). It may, however, be permissible for the parties to stipulate to the presence of an alternate juror so long as that juror does not participate in the deliberations unless ordered to do so by the court in the event a regular juror is lost. 984 . See United States v. Baccari, 489 F.2d 274 (10th Cir. 1973); United States v. Davis, 608 F.2d 698, 699 (6th Cir. 1979); United States v.

Some judges routinely offer the parties an opportunity to stipulate to such a procedure before deliberations begin. See United States v. Foster, 711 F.2d 871, 885 (9th Cir. 1983). 985 . Alternates should be substituted in the order in which they were seated. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(c). 986 . United States v.

A two-party distributor termination action, for example, is unlikely to need intense judicial management. Antitrust litigation can, however, involve voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence, extensive discovery, complicated legal, factual, and technical (particularly economic) ques - tions, numerous parties and attorneys, and substantial sums of money, calling for the application of techniques and procedures for the management of complex litigation. 989 Antitrust claims are not limited to complaints, but are also fre - 989 . Many of the principles and practices of judicial management and of the procedures dis - cussed in this Manual were initially developed in antitrust litigation. See William W Schwarzer,"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 301 quently raised in counterclaims, particularly in patent litigation. They are often brought as class actions, and may be filed in several federal and state courts con - currently with or following criminal or administrative proceedings. Lengthy trials are not unusual, nor are controversies over settlements and attorneys’ fees. The earlier sections of this manual will therefore be relevant to many of the issues that arise in the management of complex antitrust litigation, both civil and criminal. In particular, some of the procedures used to manage mass tort and securities cases (see infra sections 33.2, 33.3) may also be of value in multiparty antitrust litigation. 33.11 Managing the Issues Effective management of antitrust litigation requires that the pivotal factual and legal issues be identified, clarified, and narrowed as soon as practicable (see gen - erally supra section 21.3). Unless the judge and the attorneys give early attention to the issues, substantial time may be wasted on claims subject to summary dis - missal, on class action disputes not critical to the ruling on class certification, and on discovery not relevant to the later-refined issues regarding liability or damages. By carefully defining the issues at an early stage, the court may be able to struc - ture the litigation so as to limit the scope and volume of discovery, reducing cost and delay, facilitating the prospects of settlement, and shortening and improving the trial. The procedures for pretrial management of complex litigation discussed in supra section 21 apply generally to antitrust litigation. General principles relevant to structuring trials apply to antitrust litigation, although particular care must be taken when considering severance of damage issues from other elements of the claim (see supra sections 21.631–21.632). 990 Issues that may arise in antitrust litigation and may, depending on the cir - cumstances, be appropriate for pretrial resolution include the following: • Subject matter jurisdiction.

Whether the claimant has the necessary standing to maintain a claim for damages 993 and whether injury to competition can be demon - strated are legal issues that can sometimes be resolved by motion under Rule 12 or 56 or by a separate trial under Rule 42. • Exemptions, immunities. The application of antitrust laws may be barred or limited by statutory exemptions or immunities, such as those applica - ble to the insurance industry 994 or organized labor, 995 where restraints are imposed or authorized by state action, 996 or where collective solici tation of governmental action has occurred. 997 The application of the antitrust laws may also be circumscribed by the primary or exclusive ju risdiction of a regulatory agency. • Statute of limitations. Whether an action or claim is time-barred may be appropriate for early resolution by summary judgment. 998 • Market definition. The definition of the relevant geographic and product market, which may determine the existence of market power requisite to proof of liability and the scope of relevant evidence, can be a critical ele - ment.

The dispute over the market may be susceptible to resolution un - der Rule 56 in the absence of disputed evidentiary facts (see supra section 21.34), or through a separate bench or jury trial under Rule 42. Where extensive fact finding is required, the issue may be referred to a special master, magistrate judge, or court-appointed expert for a report and rec - ommendation (see supra section 21.5). • Theory and proof of damages. The attention given to liability issues in antitrust cases may lead to neglect of injury and damage issues. Early consideration of the proposed theory of damages and proof of cognizable injury may significantly affect the conduct of the litigation. The alleged injury may not qualify as antitrust injury, or the damages claimed may, in whole or in part, not be recoverable under the antitrust laws; if so, claims may be subject to dismissal, the scope of discovery reduced, or the method for proving damages otherwise altered. The extent to which in - jury and damages will require individualized proof can be critical in de - termining whether a class of antitrust claimants should be certified or whether a consolidated trial of separate but related claims is feasible. Early scrutiny of the claimed damages can facilitate settlement, either be - cause of the magnitude of the potential exposure or because provable damages are too small to justify the cost of pursuing the litigation. Indeed, in some cases the court may conclude that the initial discovery should be focused on the fact and amount of damages, perhaps leading to a separate trial on such issues before extensive discovery and trial on lia - bility issues, such as the existence of a conspiracy (see discussion of se - quencing discovery in supra section 21.424). If the time needed for dis - covery and trial of the issues of impact and damages caused by a particu - lar practice would be relatively short, substantial savings may be effected by postponing significant discovery on liability issues, since the damage verdict, if any, could pave the way to an early settlement. If the practice in question is well defined in scope and time, such “reverse bifurcation” may be feasible, subject, however, to substantive rules of antitrust law. In any event, the court should require the pretrial exchange of expert re - ports, computations, and exhibits regarding injury and damages (see supra section 21.48), whether a separate trial is held or not. The court should consider establishing a schedule for early completion of motion-related discovery and the submission and decision of motions. Merits discovery should be stayed only to the extent that the outcome of a motion will significantly affect the scope of that discovery."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"304 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 33.12 Transactional and Economic Data, and Expert Opinions Antitrust cases often involve the collection, assimilation, and evaluation of vast amounts of evidence regarding numerous transactions and other economic data. Some of this material may be entitled to protection as trade secrets or confidential commercial information. Effective management of such cases depends on the adoption of pretrial procedures to facilitate the production and utilization of this material and its efficient presentation at trial. Among the measures that may be useful are the following: • Limiting scope of discovery. Early attention to the issues may make fea - sible establishment of reasonable limits on the scope of discovery. Limits may be fixed with reference to the transactions alleged to be the subject matter of the case, to the relevant products or services, or to geographical areas and time periods. Limits should, however, be subject to modification if a need for broader discovery later appears. See generally supra section 21.423. • Confidentiality orders. Protective orders may facilitate the expeditious discovery of materials that may be entitled to protection as trade secret or other confidential commercial information (see supra section 21.431). Especially if the parties are competitors, provisions may be included that preclude or restrict disclosure by the attorneys to their clients. Particularly sensitive information, such as customer names and pricing instructions, may be masked by excision, codes, or summaries without impairing the utility of the information in the litigation. • Summaries; computerized data. The court should direct the parties to work out arrangements for the efficient and economical exchange of vo - luminous data. Where feasible, data that exist in computerized form should be produced in computer-readable format. Identification of com - puterized data may lead to agreement on a single database on which all expert and other witnesses will rely in their testimony. Other voluminous data can be produced by way of summaries or tabulations, subject to ap - propriate verification procedures to minimize, and more quickly resolve, disputes about accuracy, and obviating extensive discovery of source documents. Such exhibits should be produced well in advance of trial. See generally supra sections 21.446 (discovery of computerized data) and 21.492 (summaries). • Other sources. Relevant economic data may be obtainable from govern - ment or industry sources more quickly and cheaply than through discov - ery from the litigants. Accordingly, the court may wish to make an early determination regarding the admissibility of such evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8), (17), and (18)."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 305 • Expert opinions. Economists may be employed to study such topics as the relevant market, concentration of economic power, pricing struc - tures, elasticity of demand, barriers to entry, marginal costs, and the ef fect of the challenged practices on competition and the claimants. Early in the litigation, the court should call for an identification of the subjects on which expert testimony will likely be offered, determine whether such testimony is necessary, rule at least preliminarily on the appropriate scope of expert testimony, and establish a schedule for disclosure of ex - perts’ reports, recognizing that some studies may require considerable time both to prepare and to review. Agreement on a common database to be used by all experts is desirable, and the court may require the parties to agree on methodology and form before surveys or polls are conducted (see supra section 21.493). 999 Objections to the admissibility of experts’ opinions should be heard and decided in advance of trial under Fed. R. Evid. 104(a). 1000 If significant conflicts exist between the parties’ ex perts on matters of theory, the court may wish to appoint an expert un der Fed. R. Evid. 706 (see supra section 21.51). See generally supra section 21.48. 33.13 Conflicts of Interest Attention should be given early in the litigation to possible conflicts of interest that may lead to disqualification of attorneys 1001 (see supra section 20.23) or recusal of the judge (see supra section 20.121). These problems may be acute in antitrust actions brought on behalf of large classes of purchasers because (unless special steps are taken) the identification of class members—which can result in disqualification of the judge under 28 U.S.C. § 455 1002 —may not occur until after substantial proceedings have taken place. The court may wish to consider the feasibility of asking the parties to provide a list of known class members. 33.14 Related Proceedings Antitrust litigation sometimes involves a number of individual and class actions for damages filed in several federal and state courts, and may involve criminal or administrative proceedings as well.

Recognizing the desirability of centralized management, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation commonly transfers civil antitrust cases for pretrial pur - poses under 28 U.S.C. § 1407, usually to a district in which related civil cases, and sometimes also criminal or civil proceedings brought by the United States, are pending (§ 1407 does not apply to criminal cases or civil antitrust actions brought by the United States 1003 ). If centralized management of the entire litigation is impossible or impractical, the affected courts should nevertheless attempt to co - ordinate proceedings through procedures such as those described in supra sec - tions 20.123 and 31.14. Injunctions against or stays of parallel actions are gener - ally not available (see supra section 31.32). Special problems are presented when conduct that is the basis for civil an - titrust claims is also the subject of criminal or administrative proceedings. Indeed, disclosure of a criminal or administrative investigation frequently triggers the filing of civil actions (see supra section 31.2). The criminal charges should ordi - narily be tried first, not only because of the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act but also because Fifth Amendment claims tend to disrupt civil discovery. 1004 A general stay of all activities in the civil litigation pending completion of the crimi - nal case will rarely be appropriate, however. 1005 Similarly, although a decision by the Federal Trade Commission or some other agency may narrow the issues or reduce the scope of discovery, 1006 the court should carefully weigh the rights and interests of all parties before deciding whether to defer any of the proceedings in the civil actions. Special problems are also presented where parallel litigation is brought in fed - eral and state courts (see supra section 31.3) alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws arising out of substantially the same conduct. While neither 1003. 28 U.S.C. § 1407(g). 1004.

For example, enforcement proceedings may result in collateral estoppel. See, e.g., Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979). Moreover, the findings of an agency may be admissible under Fed.

More recently, the need for special procedures has been starkly demonstrated by the rapidly in - creasing volume of litigation involving new types of disasters—numerous claims arising from discrete uses of or exposures to widely distributed products or sub - stances, usually over an extended period of time. 1012 Such claims have led to the recognition of a new type of mass tort, sometimes called a latent toxic tort or simply a toxic tort. Examples include claims associated with exposure to asbestos, Dalkon Shield IUDs, silicone gel breast implants, and pharmaceutical products such as MER/29. Mass torts may also involve alleged defects in mass-produced mechanical products, such as a heart valve, a computer keyboard, or an auto - mobile. The key element of such claims is generally the similarity of activity con - nected with the design and manufacture of a product, leading to a high volume of repetitive litigation. Mass tort litigation has stimulated a considerable amount of creativity and experimentation by attorneys and judges pressed to find ways of coping with the volume of litigation, much but not all of it in federal district courts. The ALI Complex Litigation Project found that “[c]reative lawyers and judges have shown 1012.

Many inno - vative approaches raise fundamental questions about whether specific procedures, especially procedures that aggregate or segment claims, are fair to one or another group of litigants. 1014 Discussion in this manual should not be construed as as - serting a position on the legality, constitutionality, or fairness of disputed prac - tices. Courts and attorneys should assess independently the legal authority for and against some of the more novel procedures and the often interrelated factors affecting fairness and efficiency. On the other hand , in addressing novel problems for which legislative and rule-making solutions have not been found, the absence of precedent should not foreclose innovation and creativity. Indeed, the lack of such solutions makes in - novation and creativity imperative if the aim of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the “just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action,” is to be realized. Mass disaster litigation is distinct from mass toxic tort or defective product litigation. In mass disaster litigation, the injuries occur at a single site and usually manifest themselves immediately; in mass toxic tort or defective product litiga - tion injuries may occur in numerous, widely dispersed locations, at different times, and their full effect may remain hidden for years. All three types of litiga - tion require courts to deal with multiple personal injury and damage claims, but management of mass toxic tort and defective product litigation is substantially more complex and demanding. This section addresses all three types of litigation, identifying different approaches as appropriate. Management of mass tort litigation is complicated by many factors. Related cases may be filed in different courts, both federal and state, often with multiple plaintiffs and defendants. 1015 Some defendants may be in bankruptcy under ei ther 1013.

The ability of future claimants to obtain compensation may be at risk. Cases may be governed by different state laws regarding such issues as liability, the measure of compensatory damages, the standards for award of punitive dam ages, the statute of limitations, insurance coverage, and rights of contribution or indemnification. Pronounced conflicts may exist among the defendants, and the filing of third-party complaints may result in the joinder of numerous additional parties. Highly technical expert testimony is usually needed, and its admissibility often disputed, calling into play the judge’s role as the gatekeeper in reviewing novel scientific evidence. 1016 Conflicts may arise for judges and lawyers out of the complexity and volume of present and future claims, the need to adapt tradi - tional procedures to new contexts, and the need for the judge to assume an active role in managing the litigation. 1017 The ability to consolidate separate cases for joint trial may be hampered by the sheer numbers of cases and the practical limits of consolidated proceedings; moreover, consolidation of cases on all issues may not be feasible because of in - dividualized disputes as to causation and damages.

Case-management plans and orders must be promptly developed, updated, and modified as the litigation un - folds. An initial, interim case-management order will set the stage for the ongoing management process. That order should, among other things, help organize the cases and counsel, preserve evidence, set priorities for pretrial pleadings and other activity, defer unnecessary pleadings, identify preliminarily the legal and factual issues, outline preliminary discovery and motions, and direct counsel to coordi - nate the implementation of the order. The order should take into account the proposals of counsel and should encourage collaboration among counsel and the parties. 1022 Items that may be covered in initial and follow-up case-management orders in mass tort litigation are illustrated by the orders issued in one major product li - ability litigation. 1023 The initial case-management order in that litigation, 1024 issued shortly after the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the cases to the transferee judge, contained provisions which: • set the agenda and ground rules for the initial conference, notified parties that attendance would not be necessary and that parties with similar in - terests would be expected to agree to be represented at the conference by a single attorney; • established an initial service list of counsel; • urged counsel to familiarize themselves with the Manual for Complex Litigation, Third and “be prepared at the conference to suggest proce - dures that will facilitate the expeditious, economical, and just resolution of this litigation”; • directed counsel for each side to meet, confer, and seek consensus on all agenda items and, specifically, to propose a discovery plan, including methods to obtain expert discovery, a timetable for considering motions, 1022.

Later the court created an electronic bulletin board to facilitate communication 1027 and initiated a procedure to use CD-ROM technology to image and store defendants’ discovery documents, making them accessible to parties at a modest cost. 1028 Effective management requires constant attention to developments in the liti - gation. Problems—including difficulties in implementing current orders—need to be promptly identified and resolved. By soliciting feedback on the operation of the case-management plan on a continuous basis, the judge is able to obtain the information necessary to adjust case-management procedures as needed. 33.23 State–Federal Coordination Mass tort litigation frequently involves filings in both federal and state courts. While multidistrict treatment of the federal cases under 28 U.S.C. § 1407 may be possible, 1029 some state court cases may not have been removed—or may not be removable—and therefore are not subject to § 1407 transfer. When consoli dated treatment in a single court is not possible, state and federal judges should coordinate the proceedings. Coordination between state and federal courts has the potential of reducing duplication of effort, with the resulting waste of resources, and of minimizing conflicts between jurisdictions. Courts have been able to coordinate scheduling and discovery plans, to appoint joint special master s and lead counsel, to create federal–state depositories, to preside jointly at hearings, and to conduct joint set - tlement and alternative dispute resolution procedures. 1030 The difficulty of co - 1027.

The following are some of the steps a judge may consider to coordinate cases with state court judges: • direct counsel to identify the names of all similar cases that have been filed in state court, the judges to whom they are assigned , and their state of pretrial preparation; • contact judges with significant numbers of cases in each state and en - courage those judges to establish lines of communication within their state, such as designating a liaison attorney and judge to communicate with federal counterparts; • appoint one or more attorneys to serve as liaison with each state court in which a significant number of similar cases have been filed; • appoint a special master with primary responsibility for monitoring, co - ordinating, and disseminating information about state and federal activi - ties; • send sample or model case-management orders, master pleadings, ques - tionnaires, and discovery protocols to state judges with similar cases and encourage them to adopt the same or similar approaches to discovery and pretrial management; • establish a mechanism to coordinate trial dates or to conduct joint trials; • create joint federal–state, plaintiff–defendant document depositories that will be accessible to attorneys in all states; • schedule joint federal–state depositions; • hold joint pretrial conferences; • order discovery materials from prior state and federal cases to be in cluded in the document depository; • enjoin attorneys who conduct federal discovery from objecting to its use in state proceedings on the grounds that it originated in a federal court; • issue joint orders for the preservation of evidence and coordinate the ex - amination of evidence by experts in both state and federal proceedings; and"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 317 • preside jointly at status conferences, motion hearings, and perhaps even at trial. 1031 By initiating communications with the judge’s state or federal counterpart, the judge creates an opportunity for cooperation that can lead to innovative and ef - fective methods for the management and disposition of the litigation. 33.24 Organization of Counsel 1032 Several factors may complicate efforts to coordinate the attorneys’ activities through appointment of lead counsel and committees. The same factors, how - ever, also increase the need for coordination among attorneys and for judicial in - volvement in organizing counsel for efficient conduct of the litigation. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs may be unaccustomed to working as part of a litigation team; often they will have highly individualistic styles and different approaches toward discovery and trial. 1033 Incentives to cooperate may, how ever, be created by pretrial rulings. If, for example, the cases are certified as class actions, judicial control over the award of attorneys’ fees permits the judge to influence directly the organization of counsel. 1034 By scheduling consolidated cases for an early trial, the court may give plaintiffs’ counsel incentives to join in consolidated pretrial preparation. Requiring attorneys on the same side to meet and confer regarding common positions on motions can also further coopera tion. Conflicts in legal and strategic positions may make appointment of lead counsel for the defendants difficult. Nevertheless, a number of common defenses are likely, and the court should consider creating incentives for the parties to con - fer with lead counsel before embarking on any separate course of action. For ex - ample, the judge may require that individual arguments be submitted to lead counsel for consideration prior to the lead argument to the court and that lead counsel present all individual arguments that are not inconsistent with the lead argument. At a minimum, the court should designate one or more attorneys for the plaintiffs and defendants to present motions and arguments during coordinated 1031.

Cooperation among plaintiffs’ counsel through formation of national professional as - sociations to share discovery materials, technical studies, and legal research is, however, increasingly common in major mass tort litigation. Through such efforts, the time and expense of discovery in individual cases can be substantially reduced. Protective orders covering confidential information obtained during discovery in one case may be drafted to enable disclosure to attorneys for use in the other related cases, subject to appropriate restrictions precluding use or disclosure for nonlitigation purposes. 1034.

New actions may be commenced throughout the course of the litigation, particularly in cases involving latent toxic torts. Moreover, as discovery progresses additional defendants may be joined by amendments to plaintiffs’ complaints or by a succession of third-party complaints. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(1), the court should establish at the initial pretrial conference a schedule for joinder of additional parties and amendment of pleadings. The parties should be afforded a reasonable opportunity for discovery before the deadline for adding parties or amending pleadings, but the schedule should not be modified without a showing of good cause. The court may establish a presumptive period for later-added parties to join other parties—usually sixty days from service—subject to their right to seek additional time. The court should also develop a system for incorporating new plaintiffs into the structure of the litigation. For example, if prior cases are consolidated into clusters by worksite, disease, or some other feature, a system needs to be devised 1035. The cost of these services may be apportioned among all parties who benefit from the services. See Smiley v. Sincoff, 958 F.2d 498 (2d Cir. 1992); In re Air Crash Disaster at Fla. Everglades, 549 F.2d 1006 (5th Cir. 1977); In re Silicone Gel Breast Implant Prods. Liab. Litig., MDL No. 926, Order No. 13 (N.D. Ala. July 23, 1992).

Such a system may entail the collection of information about the characteristics of each new case. Necessary data could be collected at filing and could be used to create a database that would provide a continuous flow of the type of information needed to manage the litigation. The court may also wish to consider directing the defendants to compile in - formation, such as the dates on which and areas in which each defendant mar - keted a particular product, so that plaintiffs can determine the appropriate defen - dants to sue. Such records might forestall claims against the entire universe of defendants. 1036 Discovery should not ordinarily be postponed until all parties have been joined; indeed, some discovery often will be needed before all potential parties can be identified. Interrogatories may be served on the existing parties; their an - swers will be available to, and usable by, any parties later added to the litigation. Similarly, new parties may use documents produced in response to requests by others and should ordinarily be given access to document depositories. 1037 To facilitate the use of depositions by new parties, the court may adopt the proce - dures described in supra section 21.453 (deferred supplemental depositions). 33.252 Pleadings Particularly if the litigation will involve a number of actions filed, removed, or transferred over a period of time, the court should consider establishing a master file with standard pleadings, motions, and orders. 1038 Answers, third-party complaints, and motions contained in the master file may be “deemed” automat - ically filed in each new case to the extent applicable. 1039 Similarly, rulings on motions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 and 56 may be deemed to apply in the new cases, as may a pretrial order establishing a standard plan and schedule for dis - covery. These procedures will expedite proceedings in the later-filed cases, while preserving the parties’ rights to claim error from adverse rulings. The parties should not, however, be precluded from presenting special issues or requests in individual cases by supplemental pleadings, motions, and arguments. 33.253 Docketing In latent toxic torts, exposure to the product and the early manifestation of in - juries may precede functional disability and loss of earnings by years or even decades.

Multiple tort cases frequently involve claims and defenses asserted under various federal and state laws.

It can facilitate centralized decision making, minimize duplication, reduce cost and delay, further consistency in outcomes and fairness to the parties, and enhance the prospect of settlement. Implementation of aggre - gation in mass tort litigation, however, confronts the court with often very difficult problems that should be addressed early in the litigation. 1054 Moreover, because of the magnitude of the exposure, the complexity of management, and the predominance of individual issues, aggregation, whether through consolidation or class action treatment, may not be appropriate for some litiga - tion. 1055 In general, those mass torts in which general causation has become relatively clear over time are likely to be candidates for large consolidations or even class action treatment. Fairness may demand that mass torts with few prior verdicts or judgments be litigated first in smaller units—even single-plaintiff, single-defendant trials—until general causation, typical injuries, and levels of damages become established. 1056 Thus, “mature” mass torts like asbestos or Dalkon Shield may call for procedures that are not appropriate for incipient mass tort cases, such as those involving injuries arising from new products, chemical substances, or pharmaceuticals. 1057 33.261 Consolidation In mass disaster or toxic tort litigation, consolidation of all or most of the indi - vidual cases may be feasible and efficient. 1058 In other mass tort litigation, con - solidation may be feasible by subdividing cases into clusters that raise similar is - sues or present similar case-management needs. Consolidation may be limited to 1054. For a discussion of the structural differences between class actions and consolidations, see Charles Silver, Comparing Class Actions and Consolidations, 10 Rev.

Empirical research suggests that decisions to consolidate or bifurcate trials may affect jury decisions about liability and damages. Irwin A. Horowitz & Kenneth S. Bordens, Mass Tort Civil Litigation: The Impact of Procedural Changes on Jury Decisions, 73 Judicature 22 (1989). 1057. Litigation is “mature” if through previous cases (1) discovery has been completed, (2) a number of verdicts have been received indicating the value of claims, and (3) plaintiffs’ contentions have been shown to have merit.

In dealing with novel claims, however, it may be advisable to postpone deciding on a trial structure until the issues have been clarified through discovery and motions; consolidation should not be ordered until it is sufficiently clear that genuine common questions of fact or law exist. 1059 When different state laws apply, as in most multidistrict proceedings, orga - nizing cases by state or groups of states should be considered. 1060 Courts should also consider whether the cases have the same counsel on one or both sides and whether the cases are at similar stages of discovery and other pretrial development. In some instances, cases having substantially the same evidence, particularly expert and fact witnesses, may be combined. In cases with large num - bers of plaintiffs, the court may want to consider directing the parties or a special master to create a database containing relevant identifiable characteristics of the parties that might affect settlement, discovery, or trial. In toxic tort litigation, a database might store information such as (1) the circumstances of exposure to the toxic product (e.g., the worksite or other locus, time span, amount of exposure), (2) the types of diseases or injuries attributable to the exposure (e.g., asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural thickening), (3) relevant and distinguishing characteristics of multiple products, and (4) commonalty of occupations or other roles (e.g., con - sumer, bystander, spouse). 1061 Cases may be consolidated for pretrial proceedings, and even for trial, notwithstanding differences in the applicable substantive law. The evidence on li - ability that will be sought during discovery and presented at trial is often the same whether claims are premised, for example, on negligence, breach of warranty, or strict liability. Jurors in a single trial may be asked to resolve by special verdict such questions as whether a product was negligently designed or manufactured, whether it was reasonably suited for its intended use, whether it presented an un - reasonable danger to consumers, and whether adequate warnings were given about its use. Differences in the defenses and the measure of damages should create no major problems during discovery. They need to be taken into account, however, in structuring the trial; in appropriate circumstances, a joint trial of common issues may be feasible, followed by separate trials of remaining is sues. 1062 1059.

Sometimes—particularly in multidistrict litigation—the court directs that discovery first be conducted regarding those matters that bear on the defendants’ liability to all plaintiffs, 1076 deferring discovery into the de tails of each plaintiff’s unique claims. In other cases, however, recognizing the need to obtain plaintiff-specific information for settlement purposes, the court may order that such discovery be conducted concurrently with, or even preced ing, discovery from the defendants. 1077 Federal or local rules may specify in formation that must parties stipulate to procedures for the allocation of damages among members of the class, as in the Exxon Valdez litigation. 1072.

Videotaped depositions are particularly useful in multidistrict litigation where the testimony of key witnesses may have to be presented at trial in numerous, geographically dispersed transferor—or state—courts after remand. See generally supra § 21.452. 1077. Interrogatories inquiring into the extent of the plaintiffs’ damages may be useful early in the litigation even if depositions of the plaintiffs are to be delayed. Answers to such interrogato ries may be prepared without disrupting the schedule for discovery from the defendants, and may be a"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"326 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third be disclosed in advance of discovery; the judge may alter these requirements to fit the particular litigation. 1078 To avoid multiple requests for the same information, the court should en - courage or require parties with similar interests to meet and fashion joint stan - dard interrogatories and document requests. 1079 Answers to interrogatories should generally be made available to other litigants, who in turn should generally be permitted to ask only supplemental questions. In lieu of interrogatories, ques - tionnaires directed to individual plaintiffs in standard, agreed-upon form have been used successfully. The court may order that standard discovery requests be automatically deemed filed as new parties are joined or new actions filed. The court should also consider establishing document depositories, 1080 instituting procedures to facilitate the use of depositions against parties later added to the litigation, 1081 and providing counsel in related cases in other courts with access to relevant confidential materials covered by protective orders. 1082 Courts may wish to consider vacating any protective orders issued in individual cases prior to their consolidation and taking other actions to promote access to materials from other litigation. 1083 In cases that involve a massive number of claims for damages for similar in - juries, sampling techniques can streamline discovery relating to individual plain - tiffs’ activities and injuries. 1084 Sampling and surveying can be used to obtain information useful both for settlement and for bellwether trials of the sample cases or for a class trial. 1085 Whether the aim is settlement or trial, the court valuable starting point for settlement discussions. For example, in the Ohio Asbestos Litigation, special masters worked with the parties to develop standard forms with information that would be relevant to both settlement and trial. See Francis E.

In mass accident cases, it may be advisable, depending on the type and loca - tion of the disaster and the availability and adequacy of a public investigation, for the court to direct the taking of control of the physical evidence and of immediate discovery at the disaster site. This type of discovery may require participation by experts from both sides—and perhaps a court-appointed expert or special mas - ter—sifting through evidence at the site, documenting and preserving samples for common testing and use at trial, and videotaping and photographing the scene. 1086 A joint committee of experts may be formed and directed to coordi nate the collecting, recording, and testing of evidence. 1087 As soon as practical, the court should establish a central location, accessible to all parties, for storage and preservation of evidence. In mass disasters occurring on a defendant’s prop erty or involving a mechanical product, the court may require the defendant to produce blueprints or other technical drawings to enable plaintiffs to investigate the site or product adequately. In planning discovery, the court should ascertain from the parties what in - formation may be available as a result of government investigations 1088 and from prior litigation of similar cases. Reports from the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, or other public agencies may help identify witnesses and documents. Agency findings may substantially reduce the need for discovery on certain issues. 1089 Before approving the discovery plan, the judge should also ascertain the extent to which discovery materials may be available as a result of litigation in other courts. 1090 Expert opinions play a vital role in many mass tort cases, both during the dis - covery process and at trial. The court should ordinarily establish early in the liti - gation a schedule for disclosing expert opinions in the form of a written report and for deposing the experts. 1091 An early deadline for the experts’ “final” opinions may be needed to avoid the confusion that often results if opinions are Cimino v.

Evid. 706. 1092 33.28 Trial 1093 The structuring of the trial should be addressed as early in the pretrial process as is feasible. To illustrate, if the trial of a mass tort case is to proceed by using bell - wether plaintiffs, identification of those plaintiffs and discovery as to their expo - sure and injury should occur at the earliest opportunity. If the trial is to be of consolidated groups of claimants with comparable exposure or injuries, the com - position of those groups should be defined during discovery and motion practice and should be consistent with the organization of counsel. The court’s decisions should be informed by proposals and comments of counsel. In mass tort cases involving large numbers of plaintiffs, a single trial of all is - sues before a single jury may be impractical, at least in the absence of special pro - cedures. 1094 Courts have, however, experimented with various approaches to structuring trials to achieve greater efficiency and expedition in the resolution of mass tort cases. The approaches include: (1) a series of traditional trials, each with an individual plaintiff against an individual defendant on all issues, tried with the expectation that a few verdicts will establish parameters for the settlement or trial of all remaining cases; (2) a series of consolidated trials on all issues, 1095 each with groups of plaintiffs against an individual defendant or multiple defen dants; 1096 (3) 1092. See generally supra § 21.51. For an example of the use of court-appointed experts in a mass tort context, see Carl B. Rubin & Laura Ringenbach, A Role for the Court’s Expert in Asbestos Litigation, 137 F.R.D. 35 (1991).

For discussion of complex trials generally, see supra § 22. 1094. In Cimino, supra note 1085, for example, the court tried the common issues to a jury verdict and later impaneled two juries to hear the individual issues presented by a statistically repre - sentative sample of 160 plaintiffs. Using statistical techniques, the court extrapolated the verdicts from representative cases and applied the average verdicts to cases of the same disease type. For a discussion of the scientific and legal bases for the approach, see Michael Saks & Peter Blanck, Justice Improved: The Unrecognized Benefits of Aggregation and Sampling in the Trial of Mass Torts , 44 Stan.

The court should ensure that the parties’ waiver of the right to a jury trial is knowing and intelligent. After the settlement of the class claims in Jenkins (discussed above), the court cre ated a voluntary alternative dispute resolution procedure to handle future claims. The program had some initial success but the court later judged it to be ineffective, in part because some parties failed to cooperate. Cimino v. Raymark, 751 F. Supp. 649, 651 (E.D. Tex. 1990). It may therefore be advis - able to require parties to decide at the outset whether they are willing to enter into and be bound by the result of an ADR process. For discussion of ADR in general, see supra § 23.15. 1099. See Cimino , 751 F. Supp. at 664. The Fifth Circuit rejected such a trial plan in In re Fibreboard Corp., 893 F.2d 706 (5th Cir. 1990), in part on the ground that a lump sum award would not satisfy the Texas substantive law requirement of a finding of individual damages as an element of each tort claim.

Special verdicts or a general verdict with interrogatories under Fed. R. Civ. P. 49 are likely to be helpful in establishing a basis for settling the other cases or narrowing the remaining liability issues on principles of collateral estoppel.

In pursuing traditional or bellwether trials, the court will need to decide whether to have a unitary trial, or to bifurcate liability and damages, or to trifur - cate liability, general causation, and individual causation. Reverse bifurcation or trifurcation, starting with damages, has been used when the court determines that degree of injury and the amount of damages are the primary issues in dis pute. 1103 Traditional or bellwether trials of mass torts can benefit from many of the standard practices for managing trials of complex litigation. 1104 Similarities among the cases tried and cases awaiting trial may make feasible the development and use of a standard pretrial order, including generally applicable rulings on evi - dentiary and trial issues.

It is of limited utility, however, in disposing of litigation against numerous defendants who are unlikely to choose the same course. As an alternative to bankruptcy, it may be possible to set a ceiling on damages by certifying a mandatory “limited fund” settlement class that includes future claimants, obtain - ing court approval of the proposed settlement fund as fair to all members of the class, and, so long as a procedure is provided to protect future claimants, enjoin - ing the filing of additional actions. This approach has been used in some mass tort actions, but because of the difficulty in protecting the interests of future claimants, its legality is questionable. 1110 The Fourth Circuit approved such a 1108.

The court can often organize pretrial data-gathering so that it supports settlement as well as trial. In litigation with thousands of personal injury claims, courts have appointed special masters to as - semble databases that document the main features of claims. 1115 In consoli dated cases, computer-based data have been used to match individual pending cases with closed cases having similar characteristics to provide guidance for set- tlement. 1116 The parties should attempt to achieve, to the extent feasible, a “global” set - tlement, resolving not only the defendants’ potential liability to the plaintiffs, but also their liability to one another for indemnification or contribution. 1117 If the entire litigation cannot be resolved through a single settlement, partial settle - ments—by some defendants with all plaintiffs, by all defendants with some plaintiffs, or by some defendants with some plaintiffs—should be explored. 1118 If all efforts fail, the parties may be able to resolve a significant portion of the liti - gation through a series of case-by-case, party-by-party settlements. 1119 In the absence of bellwether trials or their equivalent, taking a representative sample of claims through mediation, arbitration, or another form of alternative dispute resolution can generate evaluations supporting further settlements. 1115.

The proposed settlement would include an order barring contribution and indemnity claims by other asbestos products producers and manufacturers. An alternative is for the defendants to agree to contribute specified amounts to a settlement fund, while reserving the right to litigate their respective obligations to one another. 1118. The hazards of partial settlements are discussed in supra § 23.21. 1119.

A portion of the settlement funds may be set aside to purchase an annuity or to fund a trust to pay future benefits or provide diagnostic services to plaintiffs, depending on such factors as medical developments and expenses and economic losses after the date of the settlement. 1120 Similarly, if the defendants are concerned about the possibility of actions being instituted after the settlement—for example, by mi - nors with respect to whom the statute of limitations may be tolled—some of the settlement funds may be reserved for a period of time contingent on such claims. 1121 As in other types of litigation, the assigned judge should be wary of extensive involvement in settlement. 1122 Although some judges participate actively in settlement negotiations, 1123 others take care to insulate themselves from the negotiations, leaving this activity to a special master or settlement judge; 1124 where judges have been involved, they have turned over to another judge the re- sponsibility for review and approval of the settlement. 1125 1120.

The principles and techniques of litigation management discussed else - where in this manual are also generally applicable. This section discusses issues and problems peculiar to securities litigation. 33.31 Coordination and Consolidation At the initial conference, as well as at later conferences, the judge should inquire about any related litigation pending or expected. All related litigation in the same court, including pertinent aspects of bankruptcy proceedings, should ordinarily be assigned or transferred to one judge for initial supervision and planning. The extent to which the cases should be formally consolidated for further pretrial pro - ceedings and trial will depend on the circumstances; after a period of centralized management, some cases may be appropriately reassigned to other judges of the court for further proceedings and trial. The judge should be alert to the possibility that in addition to private actions, proceedings may be initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state administrative agencies. In addition, parties may be debtors in bankruptcy, which may lead to automatic stays, removal of cases, related adver - sary proceedings, and objections to the discharge of debts. Separate actions re - garding fidelity bonds and other insurance coverage are common. Suits may also be brought to prevent foreclosure of security interests. Because the conduct alleged in securities fraud litigation often affects persons in many states, related cases—occasionally competing or conflicting—may be filed in a number of courts. Centralized pretrial management of the federal litiga - tion may be effected through transfers by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation under 28 U.S.C. § 1407. 1126 If cases remain in different courts, the judges should attempt to coordinate the proceedings, formally or informally, to minimize the risk of conflicts (see supra section 31.14; see also supra section 31.31 (coordination with related actions in state courts)).

P. 23.1 or on behalf of a class un - der Rule 23, especially one certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), other courts may conclude that a deferral of proceedings involving similar issues is justified though not required. Similarly, the judges may, after consultation with counsel, determine that one of the cases may appropriately serve as the “lead case” for purposes of discovery or trial. 1127 33.32 Issues Pleadings. Complaints in securities fraud cases typically assert numerous claims under federal and state statutes and common law against various defendants, usually including the company whose securities are involved, its officers and di - rectors, independent accountants and attorneys, and brokerage firms. 1128 In addition to claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts, plaintiffs may include claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968 (see infra section 33.8). Complaints may be lengthy, in part be - cause of the requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) that fraud be pleaded with par - ticularity. 1129 Defendants frequently need substantial time to respond to the complaint and to decide whether to file counterclaims, cross-claims, and third - party complaints. And the plaintiffs, after some initial discovery, may be willing to dismiss some of the claims and defendants. For these reasons, the judge should consider entering an order immediately after assignment of the litigation suspending the time for all defendants to re - spond to the complaint. At the initial conference, the court should, after consult - ing with counsel, establish a schedule for filing motions and additional pleadings. If there is reason to expect that plaintiffs may be able to cure apparent defects in the complaint and comply with Rule 9(b), the judge may decide to suspend the time for filing some motions and pleadings until after the plaintiffs have con - ducted limited, relevant discovery and filed amended complaints. The order should allow for timely filing of pleadings containing claims that could otherwise 1127. The first case, even if resolved by a nonjury trial, may result in collateral estoppel even as to issues that would otherwise be tried to a jury in the subsequent litigation. See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979) (defendant precluded by adverse decision in proceeding brought by SEC for equitable relief from relitigating in action for monetary relief whether proxy statement was misleading). For further discussion of coordination, see supra §§ 31.14, 31.31. 1128. In light of the Supreme Court’s holding in Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, No. 92-854 (April 19, 1994), that private plaintiffs may not maintain aiding and abetting claims under § 10(b) of the 1934 Act, the inclusion of “secondary actors” such as attorneys, accountants, and brokers may be less frequent, though such actors can still be held liable for pri - mary violations of § 10(b). See Central Bank of Denver, at 1994 U.S. LEXIS 3120, *51. 1129. Rule 9(b) applies to complaints alleging federal securities fraud. See, e.g., Greenstone v.

Discovery from the representative parties (and even from some members of the putative class) may also be warranted, although the court should limit such discovery appropriately. See supra sections 30.12, 30.232. Class definition . Various relevant matters will need to be resolved before a class can be defined. The initial complaint will occasionally include some claims—for example, reliance upon oral misrepresentations or the breach of a “suitability” standard—that rarely would be susceptible to class action treatment, along with other claims—such as an omission of a material fact from a proxy statement—that may well be presented on behalf of a class. The dates when the plaintiffs bought or sold the securities, and what information they had on those dates, may not be clear from the complaint, yet may be critical to a decision re - garding the class of persons they might properly represent. Whether the plaintiffs are able to proceed on a “fraud on the market” theory may depend both on mat - ters developed during discovery and on what claims will be pursued in the case.

They may be argued by defen - dants in opposing class action treatment, and while sometimes they may justify denial of class certification, at other times they may be resolved by appropriately limiting the definition of the class or classes that the plaintiffs may represent, by creating additional classes or subclasses, or by tailoring the relief afforded plain - tiffs. For example, the court may define a class to exclude (or treat as a subclass) those who, as often occurs in complex securities litigation, are also defendants in the class action or in related litigation. If a subclass should be formed and no rep - resentative of that subclass is a party, the court may direct notice to the unrepre - sented class members, giving them time to have a representative intervene. 1155 Although, as discussed in supra section 30.15, unnecessary classes should gener - ally be avoided, in some securities cases multiple classes or subclasses may be needed to ensure that the interests of all class members are fairly and adequately protected, particularly during settlement negotiations. Occasionally a mandatory class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) or (b)(2) may be proper, but generally classes in securities litigation will be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), with the right to no - tice and an opportunity to opt out. The right of class members to opt out of a (b)(3) class, if adequately disclosed, may cure some conflicts. Notices. Absent special circumstances, the class representatives must bear not only the cost of providing notice to the class under Rule 23(c)(2) but also the ex - pense of obtaining the names and addresses of the class members, which fre - quently are in the possession of the defendants or a transfer agent. 1156 When securities are registered in street names with brokerage houses, the assistance of the brokerage houses will be needed. 1157 Sometimes—for example, in a class action on behalf of holders of bearer bonds—the identity of class members may not be ascertainable. In such a case, notice should be given by publication in me - dia likely to be seen by the class members (see supra section 30.211). 1153. See, e.g., Hoxter v. Simmons, 140 F.R.D. 416, 421–22 (D.

Ordinarily, plaintiffs’ counsel should begin by ascertaining the categories and locations of relevant doc - uments and the potential witnesses, deferring depositions until after these docu - ments have been produced and reviewed. Reciprocal prediscovery disclosure ap - propriately directed by the court to avoid wasted effort can expedite and reduce the amount of discovery needed (see supra section 21.13). Interrogatories may be useful to identify sources of information and objective background facts and data, facilitating and expediting depositions. Discovery by plaintiffs and defendants may be conducted concurrently, particularly if information from both sides will be needed to determine whether the litigation should proceed as a derivative or class action; it may also assist the parties in entering into early settlement nego - tiations. To avoid duplicative discovery in multiple litigation, the court should require that plaintiffs in related cases prepare a single set of interrogatories to be pro - pounded to each defendant, and that the parties coordinate discovery plans. Consideration should be given to establishing a common document depository and cross-noticing depositions of common witnesses for use in all cases. 1158 The court should ascertain at the initial conference whether claims of attorney–client privilege or other requests for protective orders are likely to arise during the course of discovery, and should attempt to resolve them before they can disrupt the discovery schedule (see supra section 21.43). The court should establish early in the litigation a schedule for the exchange of expert reports and the taking of depositions, and also should adopt procedures to facilitate discovery and use at trial of summaries and computerized data. 1159 As in other cases, counsel should be expected to stipulate facts not genuinely in controversy and may be di rected to develop a joint statement of agreed (or uncontroverted) facts. 1160 33.35 Court-Appointed Special Masters and Experts Securities cases frequently present complex factual disputes over matters of ac - counting, corporate finance, and market analyses.

Related cases—both class actions and individual cases—may be consolidated for a joint trial on specified issues, such as the defendants’ respective liabilities for al - leged misrepresentations and omissions, while leaving for subsequent separate trials other issues, such as damages and individual defenses. Class or derivative actions may not be settled without court approval; the court should apply the principles and procedures governing settlements of class actions in general (see supra section 30.4).

Several actions and counteractions may be filed almost simultaneously in different courts to enjoin or remedy alleged violations of federal antitrust and se - curities laws and state statutes. Major decisions must often be made rapidly about complex factual, legal, and economic issues that involve large amounts of money and would ordinarily take months or even years to resolve. Fortunately, such liti - gation typically involves only a few parties, represented by experienced attorneys accustomed to working under severe time constraints and other pressures. The existence of state statutes and corporate defenses, such as shareholders rights plans (“poison pills”), may render time constraints less severe than suggested by the Williams Act. 1162 The court should be aware that the litigants’ positions are often influenced by effects anticipated outside the courtroom—on shareholders, other potential pur - chasers, financial institutions, and the media—and that even the timing of hear - ings and rulings may have strategic importance to the parties. 1161.

Plaintiff’s counsel will usually know or be able to ascertain the identity of counsel for the defendants. Attorneys for other compa - nies with an interest in the litigation, either as potential intervenors or as parties in related cases, may be requested to participate in the conference. In appropriate circumstances, the court may also invite counsel for government enforcement agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Conferences may be held by telephone to accommodate attorneys who are not available on short notice for a conference in chambers. Although the complaint will typically include a request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and an application for a preliminary injunction, a TRO—or, indeed, any order in takeover litigation—should almost never be granted ex parte, particularly given the opportunity for a telephone conference. Among the agenda items that may be appropriate for consideration at this initial conference, whether held in person or by telephone, are the following: • Preliminary issues. If serious questions will be raised about standing, per- sonal jurisdiction, venue, or other threshold matters that, if resolved promptly, might reduce or eliminate the need for discovery, the court should establish a schedule for expedited resolution of these issues. Counsel or the court should ascertain the status of other related cases, including times set for hearings, and make plans to coordinate the pro - ceedings to the extent possible. If jurisdiction and venue will not be con - tested, the judge may require the parties to include any related claims that may arise and enjoin them from instituting new litigation in other courts. Because of time constraints, multidistrict transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1407 is rarely feasible. Transfer of cases to a single district under 28 U.S.C. § 1404 or 1406 may, however, be appropriate; if so, such transfers should be ordered as expeditiously as possible. If the cases remain in separate courts, the judges should confer and attempt to avoid conflicts in sched - ules and rulings. • Time and form of hearing. The most significant hearing in takeover liti - gation is usually that on the preliminary injunction. The court’s ruling may moot or resolve other issues. Depending on the date of the hearing, the court may, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2), order the trial on the mer - its to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing. In some cases, the plaintiff may not seek a preliminary injunction if a hearing on a perma - nent injunction can be held expeditiously. Before deciding when to hear the application for a preliminary injunction, the judge should determine"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"344 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third whether there is a critical date by which a ruling on the application must be rendered and ascertain from counsel all dates important to the litiga - tion, including those on which any statutory waiting periods expire or significant events (such as a stockholders’ meeting or the commencement of acquisition of shares by a competing offeror) are scheduled to occur. Because of the prevalence of state statutes, such as Control Share Acquisition Acts and Business Combination statutes, as well as share - holders’ rights plans (poison pills), the federal statutory waiting period may not be controlling. The court should question counsel about the in - terplay of such laws and corporate defenses and the effect they will have on the date to be set for the hearing. If the deadline for a ruling cannot be met because of requirements of other litigation, such as criminal proceed ings subject to the Speedy Trial Act, the court should consider reassign ment of the case to another judge. The court should also obtain counsel’s views about the minimum time needed to conduct essential discovery and the hearing itself. The court may make a tentative determination on the form of the hearing—for example, whether the motion will be de cided on affidavits, depositions, and documents alone, or whether wit nesses will be heard in person and, if so, whether their direct testimony will be presented by prepared statements and reports (see supra sec tion 22.51). • Scheduling. The court should establish a schedule for filing responsive pleadings and motions, defining and narrowing issues, conducting neces - sary discovery, and holding the next conference. The schedule depends on the date set for the hearing, and will usually be substantially com - pressed compared to those typical of other litigation. For example, the court may require that the answer be combined with any motions and filed well before the twenty-day period prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a) (as the rule authorizes) and that the parties serve papers by personal de - livery rather than through the mail. In setting the schedule, the judge should take into account the suggestions and requests of counsel; al - though the schedule should be regarded as firm, unforeseen events may require revision. The attorneys should confer in advance of each confer - ence, seeking through discussion and compromise to narrow, if not eliminate, disagreements on the matters to be considered by the court. The court may also, after some discussion, adjourn the conference for a day or two to permit counsel to develop more detailed proposals for management of the case. • Emergency matters. Any pending request for a TRO should generally be resolved at the initial conference, and the court should establish a proce - dure—such as telephonic conference calls or setting aside a period before"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 345 or after normal office hours for a conference in person—for attending to other matters that may arise and require an immediate ruling, such as critical discovery disputes that the parties are unable to resolve. The judge should, however, caution the parties that unnecessary “emergency” mo - tions, whose primary purpose may be to influence the market, may sub - ject offending counsel or their clients to appropriate sanctions. All orders in takeover litigation involving entities with publicly traded securi - ties should, to the extent feasible, be announced after the market closes. These rulings may have a substantial impact on the market for both plaintiffs’ and de - fendants’ stock and are sometimes monitored by securities professionals in an attempt to take immediate action in response to the court’s actions, often to the disadvantage of less sophisticated market participants. In unusual situations in - volving important confidential information, the court may also consider holding certain proceedings in camera or receiving some evidence under seal. Expecting counsel, however, to defer disclosing the results of a court conference, even if so ordered, is probably unrealistic, and such an order could conflict with the disclo - sure requirements of the federal securities laws. Because of the limited time within which rulings must be made, the need for the judge to be personally involved in management and supervision is greater here than in other complex litigation. The court should avoid referral to a magis - trate judge or special master—such a referral may result in critical delays while rulings are reviewed. 33.42 Discovery The discovery program for this type of litigation must be carefully planned; coun - sel should be encouraged to submit a jointly agreed plan for the court’s approval. The potential scope of disputed issues can lead to excessive discovery demands, both for documents and depositions, creating unreasonable burdens on the par - ties considering the brief time usually available for compliance. The court should therefore stress the need to identify and narrow the disputed issues (see supra section 21.33) and see that the discovery plan is narrowly tailored in light of the issues (see supra section 21.41). Discovery should begin with an expedited procedure for the identification of relevant files, records, and documents necessary for the resolution of the issues. Steps should be taken to avoid excessively voluminous production that will bur - den rather than assist the parties. The court should consider the following: • limiting the relevant periods of time for discovery requests (see supra section 21.424); • having documents and files redacted to eliminate extraneous matter (see supra section 21.44);"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"346 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • requiring that relevant documents be exchanged before depositions (see supra section 21.452); • setting time limits for depositions (see supra section 21.451); • encouraging counsel and the parties to consider alternative means of ob - taining testimony in the limited time available, such as through state - ments and interviews of witnesses (see supra section 21.452) or discovery in related litigation (see supra section 21.423); • having expert opinions produced in the form of a signed report, which may avoid the need for depositions (see supra section 21.48); and • encouraging and approving stipulated protective orders (see supra section 21.43). 33.43 Additional Conferences; Preparation for Trial One or two additional conferences will usually be needed before the hearing, each conference preceded by a meeting (or conference call) among counsel. The pri - mary purposes of these conferences are to assure that schedules are being met, to narrow or revise the issues based on intervening circumstances (such as an offer being made by another company for the “target” company’s stock, or other de - fensive measures adopted or proposed to be adopted by the “target” company), and to make final preparations for the hearing. Complaints in takeover litigation frequently include a number of claims that, after further exploration, the plaintiffs may be willing to eliminate, at least for purposes of the preliminary injunction. Similarly, defenses and counterclaims may be abandoned as the hearing date approaches. The court should encourage the parties to narrow the scope of the case to the most important issues, setting a date by which they are to specify those allegations the parties will press at the hearing. Various steps may be taken to expedite and streamline the hearing: • where no substantial factual disputes exist, the hearing may be held on affidavits alone; • where there are disputes, the parties may be directed to submit state - ments of undisputed facts (see supra section 21.641) or requests for ad - mission (see supra section 21.47) to narrow the scope of the hearing; • if witnesses are to be heard, they should be identified in advance along with the substance of their testimony and the exhibits they will sponsor (see supra section 22.23); • where credibility is not a substantial factor, the court may require that di - rect testimony be offered in the form of adopted narrative statements, ex - changed in advance and subject to cross-examination and motions to strike at the hearing (see supra section 22.51);"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 347 • proposed exhibits should be exchanged in advance of the hearing and objections should be made in writing in advance of the hearing or deemed waived; • objections to foundation should be resolved before the hearing; • if deposition testimony is to be used, counsel should present stipulated summaries or extracts in lieu of lengthy readings of transcripts (see supra sections 22.331–22.332); • briefs should be submitted in advance of the hearing, along with pro - posed findings of fact and conclusions of law (see supra section 22.52) and proposed forms of order; and • where time is of the essence, the court may rule from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing, dictating findings and conclusions into the record, directing counsel to prepare and submit formal findings and conclusions based on the record. 33.5 Employment Discrimination .51 Issues and Parties 347 .52 Class Actions 348 .53 Discovery 351 .54 Trial 354 .55 Settlement 356 Individual actions alleging employment discrimination generally are not consid - ered complex. 1163 But complexity may be introduced into such litigation by class action allegations, the scope of potential discovery, the technical nature of expert testimony, and the complications that may arise from the granting of re lief, whether by way of judgment or consent decree. When there are related ac tions against the same employer, including “pattern and practice” actions by a government agency, they should ordinarily be assigned to the same judge for co - ordinated pretrial proceedings and perhaps consolidated trial. 33.51 Issues and Parties At the initial pretrial conference (see supra section 21.21), the court should at - tempt to identify the specific acts of discrimination each plaintiff (or intervenor) claims to have suffered and the particular relief sought. The court should also as - certain that the administrative prerequisites to the filing of an action have been 1163. But note that under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(5), such cases are to be heard “at the ear liest practicable date and in every way expedited.” If the case is not scheduled for trial within 120 days after joinder of issues, a special master may be appointed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 53."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"348 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third timely satisfied by named plaintiffs. 1164 Early identification of the individual claims that may be pursued in the litigation is needed as a foundation for a de - termination whether they qualify for class certification 1165 and for develop ment of an appropriate plan for discovery and trial. The initial narrowing of is sues may usually be accomplished without discovery; if jurisdictional facts are disputed — such as when a plaintiff received a “right to sue” letter—they can be resolved through an expedited hearing, evidentiary if necessary. Plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases often seek relief that might ad - versely affect other employees or putative employees of the defendant employer. Where potentially affected employees are represented by a labor organization, even if only the employer was named in the administrative charges or is alleged to have been guilty of discrimination, it may be advisable to join the organization as a necessary party or to have it intervene in order to make the decree binding if plaintiffs are successful. 1166 Similarly, in some cases joinder of or intervention by other employees who would be adversely affected by plaintiffs’ relief may also be warranted to ensure that all competing interests are adequately represented and to protect against subsequent claims of reverse discrimination 1167 (see also infra section 33.55). 33.52 Class Actions Employment discrimination cases that meet the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) may qualify as class actions under Rule 23(b)(2) where the defendant “has acted . . . on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final in - junctive relief with respect to the class as a whole.” They may also qualify under Rule 23(b)(3) on the ground that a common question of fact or law predomi - nates; indeed, where monetary relief is sought, a (b)(3) class is generally the ap - propriate vehicle. Whether the action is maintained under (b)(2) or (b)(3) will make a significant difference with respect to various aspects of class action litiga - tion, in particular the definition of the class, entitlement to damages, class notice, and opt-out rights (see supra sections 30.14, 30.231). Members of a Rule 23(b)(2) class generally are not entitled to recover other than incidental damages (i.e., damages to which plaintiffs would be automatically entitled once liability is established). 1168 For that reason, and because res judi cata 1164.

On the other hand, in a (b)(3) ac tion, where plaintiffs’ primary claim is for damages, the class must be defined with more specificity and the court must satisfy itself that the determination of individual claims does not preclude the existence of a predominant common question. Because Rule 23(c)(4) permits an action to be maintained as a class ac - tion with respect to particular issues, a (b)(3) or (b)(2) class may be certified for bifurcated adjudication of a common issue (stage I), to be followed by separate trials (coordinated or consolidated as may be appropriate) to adjudicate individ - ual damage claims (stage II) (see infra section 33.54). In addressing a motion for class certification, the court needs to consider whether the complaint challenges an employment practice affecting a class of employees or whether instead it primarily challenges the individual treatment of employees. A complaint alleging a policy and practice of racial discrimination may satisfy the requirements for a (b)(2) action. 1169 Where, however, plaintiffs seek class-wide relief on the basis of the impact of such a policy on their individ - ual employment conditions, they must also show that their claims are sufficiently related to those of the putative class members that they meet the requirements of commonality and typicality for the class. 1170 In determining the appropriate class, the court must ascertain whether the practice or conduct complained of involves the entire operation of the employer, or only a specific facility, department, or individual supervisor. To ascertain the precise nature of the class claim and whether it meets the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the court should in the first instance probe beneath the pleadings to identify the particular practice or procedure complained of and the extent to which the evidence that will be offered to support the class plaintiffs’ claims will also support the claims of members of the class. Some discovery may be needed although, as noted, precertification discovery should be held to a minimum (see supra section 30.12). Occasionally, as indicated, the class claims will be consolidated with individual claims and there may be reasons for proceed - ing with merits discovery on the latter. Where that is the case, an effort should be 1169. General Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 159, n.15 (class members need not be identically situated and a class action of both applicants and incumbents might be justified if a general policy of dis - crimination were shown to manifest itself in both hiring and promotional practices in the same gen - eral fashion); see, e.g., McKenzie v.

Cal. 1977)."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"350 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third made to organize discovery so as to avoid duplication. Disposition of the individ - ual claims should not, however, affect the ruling on the class motion; the merits of the individual claims will not determine whether the class action can go for - ward and certification is appropriate. The court’s ruling on certification should describe the class (and any sub - classes) as precisely as possible, both to facilitate planning for discovery, trial, and settlement and to define the persons (and claims) that will be entitled to relief under and barred by a final judgment in the action. 1171 A precise definition of the issues to be tried is important for, among other things, res judicata and collat eral estoppel. This definition should be stated in objective terms to the extent feasible—for example, all female applicants during a specified time who, like the plaintiffs, failed to meet the employer’s height and weight requirements. If not clear from the description of the class itself, the nature of the claimed class dis - crimination should be indicated—for example, all persons of color employed by the defendant during a specified period who allege that they were denied promo - tion during that period on account of their race. Definitions should exclude cri - teria that are subjective or depend on the merits of the claim (see supra section 30.14). Although the court is authorized under Rule 23(c)(1) to enter a condi - tional order of certification and modify it prior to final judgment, later modifications can be prejudicial to class members and interfere with the effective management of the action, and should therefore be avoided. See supra section 30.11. Rule 23 does not provide for opt out by members of a (b)(2) class. If the court determines that certain members of the class should be excluded, perhaps because their interests are aligned with management (see supra section 30.24) or to avoid conflicts within a class, it may tailor the class definition appropriately to exclude certain persons from the class or create one or more subclasses. 1172 Notice to class members must be given when a (b)(3) class is certified. It is not required for a (b)(2) class, but may be advisable for a number of reasons, such as to bring to light possible conflicts and to ensure the res judicata effect of a judgment. The form of notice—individual mailing, posting on bulletin boards, or inclusion in pay envelopes—will depend on the circumstances of the case (see supra section 30.2). While the cost of notice is generally borne by plaintiffs, 1173 in employment litigation relatively cost-free methods of reaching at least current 1171. See Cooper v. Federal Res. Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867 (1984) (related “individual” claims of discrimination not precluded by a finding of no “class” discrimination). 1172. See Penson v. Terminal Transp.

Moreover, where notice is being given in a (b)(2) action at the employer’s request, it may be required to bear the cost. Collective actions are authorized to be brought by employees asserting claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 626(b), or the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). While all included plaintiffs need to be similarly situated, the possibility of varying defenses does not vitiate a collective action. 1174 The requirements that apply to class actions un der Rule 23 need not be met, 1175 although notice should be given of ADEA collective actions. 1176 33.53 Discovery In planning the discovery program for employment discrimination litigation, five characteristics should be taken into account: 1. many aspects of the company’s employment practices and its workforce may be potentially relevant as circumstantial evidence; 2. most of the information will be within the control of the employer, often in computerized form; 3. except for actions brought by the government, plaintiffs usually have limited resources; 4. expert testimony and complex statistical evidence will play an important role at trial; and 5. trial will often be conducted in stages. Identification of source materials. Discovery can be greatly simplified and expedited if the parties are directed to exchange core information before discov - ery begins. That information should include not only that required under Rule 26(a)(1) and the district’s local rules or expense and delay reduction plan, but also potentially relevant documentary materials such as statements of employ - ment policies, policy manuals and guides, and an identification and general ex - planation—perhaps with samples—of the types of records that contain data that may be relevant to the issues in the case. After obtaining this information, plain - tiffs may need to depose or interview informally the personnel director or other person responsible for maintaining these records in order to clarify the nature of the information contained in these records, how the information is coded or compiled, and how data may be extracted from the various sources. Employers frequently maintain the same or similar information in different forms. For ex - 1174. See Lockhart v. Westinghouse Credit Corp., 879 F.2d 43 (3d Cir. 1989). 1175. See Anson v.

Job histories of employees may be determined from periodic transfer and promotion records, from individual work record cards, or from per - sonnel files. The company may also have compiled relevant data regarding its workforce and employment practices for reporting to governmental agencies or for use in other litigation. The parties can then determine the most efficient and economical method for the employer to produce, and plaintiffs to obtain, the most relevant information. Because many aspects of the company’s employment practices may have some potential relevance as circumstantial evidence, and vari - ous records may contain information about these practices, judgment needs to be exercised in deciding what information is necessary and how that information may be most efficiently produced. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g), counsel are re - quired to weigh the potential value of particular discovery against the time and expense of production, and under Rule 26(b)(2) the judge is expected to limit discovery to avoid duplication and unjustified expense. Computerized records. The time and expense of discovery may usually be substantially reduced if pertinent information can be retrieved from existing computerized records. Moreover, production in computer-readable form of rele - vant files and fields (or even of an entire database) will reduce disputes over the accuracy of compilations made from such data and enable experts for both sides to conduct studies using a common set of data. The parties’ computer experts should informally discuss, in person or by telephone, procedures to facilitate re - trieval and production of computerized information; the attorneys can then confirm these arrangements in writing. See supra section 21.446. Confidential information. The privacy interests of employees may be pro - tected by excluding from production records or portions of records the contents of which are irrelevant to the litigation (employees’ medical histories, for exam - ple, are rarely of significance in a discrimination case) or by masking the names of individuals in particular compilations. If the company fears exposure to privacy claims were it to disclose personal information voluntarily, the parties may draft an order for entry by the court, directing the employer to provide the informa - tion. A protective order barring unnecessary disclosure of sensitive items may also be useful in facilitating the production of relevant information. The persons to whom plaintiffs’ counsel will be permitted to disclose confidential materials will depend on the circumstances. For example, counsel might be allowed to disclose some sensitive information to the plaintiffs or even to class members, but permit - ted to disclose information about tests only to an expert. See supra section 21.43. Preservation of records . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations require that, when a charge of discrimination or a civil action has been filed, the “employer shall preserve all personnel records relevant to the charge or action until final disposition of the charge or action.” 29 C.F.R."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 353 § 1602.14. The parties may disagree on which records are covered by this man - date, particularly with respect to computerized data that may be periodically erased as new information is electronically stored. A separate order of the court may be needed both to clarify what records must be preserved and to provide re - lief from unduly burdensome retention requirements. See supra section 21.442. Statistical evidence and expert testimony. Employment discrimination liti - gation frequently involves the collection and presentation of voluminous data re - garding characteristics of the company’s workforce and its employment practices. In addition to using data already computerized by the company, the parties often prepare new databases, electronically storing information manually extracted from other records. To eliminate disagreements about the accuracy of these new databases and to reduce the time and expense otherwise involved in preparing and verifying separate databases, the parties may—with the court’s encourage - ment—be able to agree on joint development of a common database on which their respective experts will conduct their studies. If agreement on a common database cannot be obtained, pretrial verification procedures should be used to eliminate (or quantify) errors in the different databases (see supra sections 21.446, 21.493). As discussed in supra section 21.492, this information should, whenever possible, be presented at trial through summaries, charts, and other tabula- tions, 1177 and pretrial procedures should be adopted to facilitate this presenta tion and reduce disputes over the accuracy of the underlying data and the compi - lations derived from such data. Indeed, to the extent practicable, disputes at trial regarding statistical evidence should be limited to its interpretation, relevance, and weight, not its accuracy. Experts who will present statistical studies or express opinions should be required to prepare and disclose a written report containing a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and all exhibits to be used, the basis and reasons for them, and the data and information considered in arriving at them. 1178 The parties’ experts’ reports should be exchanged before expert depositions are taken. 1179 After reviewing these reports and considering the comments of counsel, the court may conclude that it should appoint an indepen - dent statistical expert under Fed.

The extent to which discovery from class members should be permitted, as well as the timing and form of such discovery, will depend on the circumstances of the case. Court approval should usually be required before any discovery from class members is undertaken, and the judge should limit such discovery to that which is genuinely needed and ensure that it is not used to harass either the members or the representatives of the class (see supra sections 30.12, 30.232). As noted in supra section 33.52, depositions of a limited number of putative class members are sometimes needed prior to a ruling on class certification. In some cases, limited discovery from class members may be conducted before a stage I trial on liability to the class, with the rest deferred (see supra section 33.54). 1181 Each party should ordinarily be permitted to depose any class member whom the other party plans to call as a witness, and discovery may also be appropriate of a class member whose employment history will be used as evidence showing the existence (or non-existence) of the alleged discrim ination. Whether anecdotal experiences of individual class members are relevant at a stage I trial will depend on the circumstances of the particular case (see supra section 33.54). If such evidence will become relevant at subsequent proceedings only if liability to the class is established at the stage I trial, discovery from those class members may be deferred until after the first trial. Similarly, class members on whose behalf claims for individual relief are presented after a finding of class - wide liability may be treated as subject to discovery. 33.54 Trial Employment discrimination class actions have commonly been tried in separate stages under Rule 42(b). 1182 In some cases the class issues may themselves be severed, with the stage I trials of different class issues conducted separately. The stage I trial determines whether the defendants have discriminated against the class. Whether the merits of the individual claims of the class representatives should be tried in stage I depends on whether proof of those claims is essential to establishing liability on the class claim. If class-wide discrimination is found, is - sues of relief are tried in stage II. Since the 1991 amendment of Title VII, parties in disparate treatment cases are entitled to request a jury trial. If a jury is de - manded, the bifurcation of class actions will be substantially more complicated. 1180. See generally Joe S. Cecil & Thomas E. Willging, Court-Appointed Experts: Defining the Role of Experts Appointed Under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 (Federal Judicial Center 1993); Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence (Federal Judicial Center 1994). 1181.

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 491 F.2d 1364 (5th Cir. 1974)."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 355 Although the class-wide issue of discrimination is readily tried to a jury in stage I, the trial of individual damage claims to a jury in stage II will result in potentially lengthy trials since in some cases Title VII permits recovery of back pay as well as compensatory damages, including future loss and pain and suffering. Moreover, the court must consider whether fairness to the parties requires that both liability and relief be tried to a single jury. In view of these complexities, the class certification may be limited to the (b)(2) issue (class-wide liability and injunctive relief), with all other claims proceeding as separate actions but contingent on the outcome of the (b)(2) trial (see supra sections 30.17, 33.52). Where the case is tried to the court instead, the court in stage I determines the appropriateness of class-wide injunctive relief. An immediate appeal from the ruling on injunctive relief is permissible under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a). Because reso - lution of claims for individual relief can be an expensive and time-consuming process, such an appeal may be desirable as a means for obtaining early appellate review of a finding of liability. If an appeal under § 1292(a) is unavailable, the court can consider certifying its ruling on class liability for appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) (see supra section 25.11). The award of attorneys’ fees may be deferred until completion of proceedings for individual relief; an interim award, however, is frequently made after a grant of injunctive relief. 1183 In stage II the court, perhaps after a period for additional discovery, resolves the individual damage claims of the class members. In this second stage, the claimants—who, by proof of their membership in the class, are presumed to have been subjected to the dis - crimination practiced against the class 1184 —are permitted to present their in- dividual claims of injury, 1185 subject to the right of the employer to raise de fenses to those claims that were not resolved during the stage I proceedings. Further severance may be useful at the individual remedy stage. For example, the court may identify those entitled to relief before the parties proceed with discov ery and possible trial regarding the amount of damages. The court may require class members to complete information forms disclosing the critical facts—e.g., the job bids that they assert were discriminatorily rejected by the company—on which their claim of individual injury is based. The court may establish a claims 1183. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). 1184. McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe, 494 F.2d 211 (5th Cir. 1974); King v.

When the trial of the action is bifurcated into stages, the court should define precisely the issues to be resolved at the stage I trial, as well as those to be decided in subsequent proceedings if class-wide discrimination is found at stage I. Although this delineation will not eliminate all duplicative evidence—for exam - ple, anecdotal testimony may be admissible as circumstantial evidence at the first trial and, if liability is established, be offered as direct evidence on individual claims in later proceedings—it will enable counsel to prepare more effectively for both stages of the litigation. Issues are generally separated according to the extent they depend on the particular circumstances of individual employees; for exam - ple, defenses such as “business necessity” and “bona fide occupational qualification” are usually resolved at stage I, while the issue of whether employees may be excused from making applications for a position is generally reserved for decision in later proceedings. The focus of the stage I trial, whether to the court or the jury, will frequently be on statistical evidence and expert testimony. Pretrial planning should consider the extent to which “anecdotal” evidence regarding the individual experiences of various employees, union stewards, supervisors, and managers will also be re - ceived. Such evidence may be offered by plaintiffs or defendants to provide illus - trative support for their respective positions and for the studies conducted by their experts. Some limits on the number of witnesses may be appropriate, how - ever, to avoid unnecessary duplication, 1186 and pretrial disclosure should be required of their names and the general subject matter of their expected testi - mony. 1187 33.55 Settlement Timing. Precertification settlements of discrimination cases brought as class ac - tions present special problems and should be approached with great caution (see generally supra section 30.45). Similarly, if the parties propose settlement of only the individual claims of the named plaintiffs and abandonment of the class claim, the court should take the steps necessary to ensure that members of the putative class are not prejudiced. The court may decide that the putative class should be notified of the proposed settlement and given an opportunity to intervene to pur - sue the class claims (see supra section 30.212). Settlement negotiations in class actions should ordinarily be deferred until the court has ruled on class certification; in employment discrimination litigation, the parties should explore settlement possibilities as the case proceeds toward trial after the certification 1186. Cf. Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., 530 F.2d 1159, 1172 (5th Cir. 1976). 1187. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3)."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 357 ruling, and, if those initial efforts are unsuccessful, they should renew their dis - cussions after the stage I trial. Affirmative relief. Many employment discrimination cases terminate in con - sent decrees or in litigated judgments that order implementation of certain em - ployment practices that may be seen as constituting affirmative action. Such pro - visions raise difficult issues concerning their effect on groups of employees that may be adversely affected by them and their vulnerability to subsequent legal challenge. 1188 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 establishes procedures for precluding subsequent challenge by persons who (1) prior to entry of the order, had ac tual notice of the potential adverse effect and an opportunity to object, or (2) who were adequately represented. 1189 Parties to the decree may also seek interven tion or joinder of persons who may claim to be adversely affected. Attorneys’ fees. Ethical concerns may be raised by parties’ attempts to settle claims for attorneys’ fees before a settlement of the class claims has been effected or, indeed, if the defendants offer to settle class claims by payment of a lump sum on condition that attorneys’ fees be waived Although the parties should be en - couraged to settle claims regarding attorneys’ fees, these negotiations preferably should not be commenced until the class claims have been resolved by trial or settlement. See supra sections 23.24, 24.21, 30.42. Settlement hearing. Hearings on approval of class action settlements in em - ployment discrimination litigation may generate vigorous objections. 1190 Because such opposition often stems from misunderstandings about the terms of the proposed settlement, the notice of settlement should provide full information in comprehensible form. Class counsel may also schedule, in advance of the hearing, meetings with the class at which counsel and the class representatives can explain in person the terms of the agreement and can answer questions. At the outset of the hearing, before the court proceeds to hear objections from class members or others, counsel should again describe in plain language the key fea tures of the settlement, clarify misunderstandings, and indicate why they believe it to be advantageous to the class (see supra section 30.43). The judge may also explain portions of the proposed settlement that may have been confusing to members of the class. In its notice to the class of the proposed settlement, the court should usually require that any objections or requests to be heard be filed in writing by a specified date. It is advisable, however, to permit persons who have not filed timely objections to express their views at the hearing, including repre sentatives 1188. Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755 (1989). 1189. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n). 1190. Opposition to the settlement does not, however, mean that it should necessarily be rejected by the court. See, e.g., Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1977). See also supra §§ 30.41–30.44."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"358 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third of employees not members of the class who claim they will be adversely affected by the settlement. Implementation. Settlements of employment discrimination cases sometimes specify the persons to whom awards will be made and the amount each person is to be paid. More frequently, however, settlements have provided only the basic principles for determining these awards, contemplating further proceedings to as - certain the factual matters on which the awards depend. The settlement may, for example, establish one or more funds to be shared by persons satisfying pre - scribed criteria; in this situation the court may require class counsel after the set - tlement to preliminarily identify those class members eligible to participate in dis - tribution, and provide those found ineligible an opportunity to present their claims to the court or a special master. If the settlement provides for a specified payment—whether a flat sum or an amount determined under a formula—to be made to each class member meeting specified criteria, the defendants may have a financial interest in challenging the claims of class members, and the court may refer such matters to a magistrate judge or special master under Rule 53 for indi - vidual hearings as necessary (see supra section 30.47). The court may also decide to appoint a special master under Rule 53 to monitor future implementation of injunctive features of the settlement (see supra section 21.52). 33.6 Patent .61 Technology 359 .62 Defining the Issues 360 .63 Related Litigation 362 .64 Discovery 362 .65 Expert Opinions 364 .651 Control of Expert Testimony 364 .652 Admissibility of Expert Testimony 365 .653 Court-Appointed Experts 365 .66 Trial 365 .67 Appeals 365 The principal source of complexity in patent litigation generally is the technical nature of the subject matter. Its unfamiliarity poses unique problems for judges and juries. Expert witnesses often have a dominant role. While general principles of effective case management (discussed elsewhere in this manual) apply to patent cases, primary attention must be directed to the management of the technical as - pects of patent cases. In that respect, patent litigation has much in common with other types of litigation that increasingly require courts to deal with technical subject matter, such as copyright and trademark, mass tort, employment discrimination, and"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 359 even criminal litigation. The principal focus of this chapter, therefore, is on the management of the technical aspects of patent litigation. Patent cases generally have only one party, or a few interrelated parties, on each side of a case. Litigation over a patent or a series of related patents may, however, proliferate and lead to multiforum litigation in federal courts requiring resort to procedures for coordination through MDL proceedings, the imposition of stays on redundant actions, or informal arrangements. 33.61 Technology The judge will often need some general explanation of the substance and termi - nology of the science or technology involved in the subject matter of the patent before attempting to deal with the issues in the case or develop a plan for discov - ery and trial. 1191 Therefore, at an early stage, typically at or before the initial conference, the court may ask counsel to provide a concise and objective overview, orally or in writing, of the technical matters, including a definition of key terms and concepts. To encourage candor, the court may direct that these statements will not bind the parties and may not be used against them later in the proceedings. The court may also ask the parties jointly to develop a glossary of terms and concepts, using a procedure similar to that described in supra sec - tion 21.47 for developing a joint statement of uncontested and contested facts. The judge may also convene an informal pretrial conference with both sides’ experts present at which the experts are called on to explain the reasons for their different opinions or conclusions. The judge should not hesitate to ask questions to probe behind their opinions and seek explanations in order to identify, nar - row, and understand the issues. The judge will be able to prepare for the confer - ence by reading the reports prepared by the parties’ experts for the trial (see supra section 21.48). Increasingly, judges seek additional pretrial briefing on technological or sci - entific issues involved in the case. Although experts will in their trial testimony address those issues, judges look for a more nonadversarial setting to learn the fundamentals—the vocabulary and general intellectual framework of the subject matter—in order to deal more intelligently with issues arising during the trial. In some cases, jurors have been included in what is sometimes called a tutorial. It may be given at the outset of the trial by experts selected by the opposing sides or by a court-appointed expert, preferably selected from a list submitted by the par - ties (see supra section 21.51). Limiting the use of the court-appointed expert to explaining the general subject matter, without becoming involved in the disputes of the parties, will make it easier to maintain neutrality.

Caution should be exercised by the judge in making demands on the parties for pretrial educational materials or services. Because they may be quite costly, the court should inquire about the prospective cost before issuing directions. 33.62 Defining the Issues The typical patent case involves a number of separate, but related, claims and de - fenses. In addition to seeking injunctive relief and damages for the alleged in - fringement, plaintiffs often assert claims of unfair competition, wrongful business interference, and other similar state law tort claims. Defendants may plead spe - cially several of the statutory bars under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103 or other sec - tions of Title 35, as well as assert misuse of the patent or other equitable defenses and counterclaim for violations of antitrust laws. Although a sufficient basis for these contentions may exist for purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, many may prove to be without merit and may be abandoned by the time of trial. The court should consider requiring the parties to submit detailed statements of their claims and defenses early in the litigation. Sometimes statements of claims can be supplied at the outset of the case. At other times, when the accused product is not available or not subject to examination, some discovery may be re - quired. The statement submitted by plaintiff should contain a detailed explana - tion of the infringement contentions; it may be an element-by-element claims chart for each claim asserted. It should also specify which claims are alleged to have been infringed wantonly or willfully. The defendant should be required to respond to the claims chart at the same level of detail. This will help narrow the issues. The court should set a date by which the defendant will be required to state those defenses it expects to litigate. The court should allow reasonable time for discovery to determine which defenses have factual support. The court should also set a date for the disclosure of all prior art that defendant will use to chal - lenge the patent. Under 35 U.S.C. § 282, disclosure must be made “at least thirty days before the trial,” but the court should generally fix an earlier deadline to al - low adequate time for trial preparation. With encouragement from the court, counsel may be willing to drop marginal claims or defenses at the time of the initial conference, or at least agree that discovery on them should be deferred while attention is given to the significant issues. Some of these issues may, of course, also be subject to early resolution by motion under Fed. R. Civ. P.12 or 56.

Particularly in nonjury cases, the trial judge may call on another judge to conduct any in camera inspections that are needed to determine whether sufficient evi - dence of fraud exists for the privilege to be waived. In this connection, the court needs to be concerned with whether litigation counsel was involved in the prosecution of the patent before the patent office or provided prelitigation advice regarding validity, in particular giving a non- infringement letter. Where a willful infringement claim is asserted, if the alleged infringer continued to market a product after notice of a patent, it may be re - quired to waive its privilege with respect to advice letters from counsel. 1193 Even in other circumstances, discovery from the attorney who prosecuted the patent is common. Because this will greatly complicate discovery and may un dermine the effectiveness of litigation counsel, the court should determine early in the case what role counsel played with respect to the challenged patent, con sider the potential ethical and practical problems, and determine whether to obtain the client’s written consent to the representation after full disclosure. Bifurcation for trial under Rule 42(b) may be advisable to avoid unnecessary time and expense of discovery and trial (note, however, that the Supreme Court has indicated a preference that the district court resolve invalidity issues even if no infringement is found 1194 ). In most cases, damages should be severed from other issues to simplify the task of the fact finder. Sometimes trifurcation of the statutory issues, equitable defenses, and damages may be advisable. Some de - fenses—for example, an “on sale” bar—may be dispositive and suitable for early trial. Discovery and trial with respect to claims of unfair competition and an - titrust counterclaims frequently are deferred until resolution of the patent issues, at which time these claims are often resolved by voluntary dismissal or settlement. 1192. Fraud may be asserted not only as a defense to the infringement claim, but also as part of the foundation for an antitrust counterclaim. See Walker Process Equip. Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem.

Sometimes transfer is ordered to a single court under 28 U.S.C. § 1407 for cen - tralized pretrial proceedings, although the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation may decline to order such transfers on the ground that coordination can be achieved through the cooperative efforts of the affected courts and counsel (often the real parties in interest and the attorneys are the same, or at least related, in all cases). It is common practice to stay all pending litigation except the first suit between the patent owner and a manufacturer or high-level distributor. Later suits against customers are routinely stayed, and a declaratory judgment suit by the manufacturer of the claimed infringing product is preferred over even an ear - lier filed suit by the patent owner against a customer. 1195 In the absence of a stay, techniques such as those described in supra section 31.13 may be used to avoid or minimize duplicative discovery and potential conflicts in pretrial and trial schedules. Decisions by other courts involving the same patent require careful study. A final decision holding the patent invalid will preclude further efforts to enforce the patent against others—provided the patentee “had a full and fair chance to litigate” its validity. 1196 In such circumstances, however, the patentee must be given the opportunity to demonstrate under the factors outlined in Blonder- Tongue that “in justice and equity” it should not be collaterally estopped by the adverse decision. Although a decision upholding the validity of the patent will not bar a new defendant from attacking the patent and, indeed, is not necessarily binding even on the same court under the doctrine of stare decisis, the decision is nevertheless entitled to appropriate weight in a subsequent case, the weight de - pending primarily on the degree of similarity of the prior art and other evidence introduced in the two cases. 1197 33.64 Discovery Discovery frequently is conducted according to a prescribed sequence of issues, particularly if severed trials under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) are contemplated. This approach, however, may cause extra expense and delay if discovery regarding the priority issues will involve examination of many of the same witnesses and ex - hibits as discovery on the subsequent issues. Moreover, deferral of discovery re - garding damages may complicate efforts to evaluate the litigation for settlement. 1195. William Gluckin & Co. v.

In some cases the parties prefer that inspection of such facilities and exhibits be done by a court-appointed expert or special mas ter, rather than by someone associated with their adversary. For further protec tion, filing of sensitive documents may either be waived under Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d) or be made under seal. At the initial conference, the court should ascertain the extent to which dis - covery will be sought of matters that may be protected by the attorney–client privilege or work-product doctrine and, if so, whether disclosure will be resisted (see supra section 33.62). Use of a special master may be warranted if such dis - putes will be extensive and cannot be resolved by considering a few specimen documents. Early inquiry should also be made about use of out-of-court tests or in-court demonstrations. If tests are contemplated, protocols should be set up at an early conference with respect to who may attend or observe, what criteria must be met to permit use of the results in court, and when disclosure of the results must be made. The court should set a deadline for pretrial disclosure of any such tests or proposed demonstrations and may wish to consider before trial objections to the admissibility of such evidence. The parties should not undertake formal discovery outside the country with - out prior approval from the court, and any requests for documentary evidence in such countries should be precisely and narrowly drafted (see supra sec - tion 21.494).

The court should require the parties to iden - tify the technical experts they propose to present and the subject matter to be covered by each. Compliance with the requirements of Rule 26(a)(2) will rou - tinely lead to such disclosure, but it is advisable for the court, after having heard from counsel, to determine as early as possible what witnesses will be permitted to testify in order to avoid the expense of complying with the disclosure rule with respect to experts who will be barred. Technical experts are those whose special training or experience in the appli - cable technology or science qualifies them to express opinions bearing on the va - lidity or invalidity of the patent—such as the scope and content of the prior art, the level of skill in the art, and the obviousness or non-obviousness of the claimed invention in view of the prior art 1200 —and on the alleged infringement. Some witnesses testifying to some of this subject matter—for example, the history of the invention—may be percipient witnesses testifying to fact rather than opinion. Some witnesses may testify both as experts and fact witnesses. The nature of a witness’s testimony should therefore be clearly identified for purposes of the dis - covery rules and the rules of evidence. Patent law experts—patent attorneys, patent law professors, or former officials of the Patent and Trademark Office—are frequently offered to express opinions on legal issues, such as alleged estoppel arising from the prosecution of the application for the patent in question, the duty of disclosure to the patent office, and whether or not that duty has been violated by particular acts or omis - sions during such prosecution. Because this testimony relates to legal issues that counsel for the parties are able to argue, the need for it should be questioned by the judge. Because of the cost and time consumed by expert discovery and expert testi - mony at trial, the court should place appropriate limits on the number of experts parties will be permitted to use at trial. Rarely should it be necessary to have more than one expert witness with respect to any particular technological or scientific discipline. 1200. See Graham v.

A case may involve scores of defendants and third-party defendants, with numerous counterclaims and cross claims seeking indemnification and contribution. 1205 Defendants are frequently corporations, including foreign corporations and defunct corpora - tions, and, in cases involving larger sites, are likely to be geographically dispersed. The act provides for nationwide service of process. 1206 U.S. district courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over all controversies arising under CERCLA. 1207 These cases differ from mass tort claims in that they do not involve personal in - juries, 1208 but they may be related to, and require coordination with, mass tort 1203.

The number of parties and issues typically calls for treating CERCLA cases as complex litigation. Many of the general principles applicable to complex litigation apply to CERCLA cases. 1209 This subchapter concentrates on the special features of CERCLA cases. Other federal environmental statutes, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act, may involve similar management issues. Consequently, the discussion in this sec - tion may suggest approaches to analogous problems arising under those statutes, although it does not directly address issues under statutes other than CERCLA. 33.71 Statutory Framework Pursuant to CERCLA, the EPA develops and promulgates standards and goals for cleaning up hazardous waste sites across the country. The results of EPA’s efforts are published as federal regulations, which include the National Contingency Plan (NCP), the Hazardous Ranking System (HRS), and the National Priority Listing (NPL). Using the standards set forth in the NCP and the HRS, the EPA lists “facilities” on the NPL that contain “hazardous substances” and that may represent a danger of “release” of those substances into the environment. 1210 CERCLA imposes joint and several liability, with rights of contribution, on the following types of entities associated with a hazardous disposal facility: current owners or operators of the facility, past owners or operators, those who arranged for disposal of hazardous waste (usually referred to as “generators” of hazardous materials), and transporters of such materials. 1211 Collectively, these groups are referred to as “potentially responsible parties,” or PRPs. Federal, state, and local governments have been held includable as defendants under the large CERCLA umbrella. 1212 Liability is strict, with relatively few and narrow statutory defenses (e.g., that a third-party or an act of God was the sole cause of the dis charge). 1213 1209.

In addition, courts have interpreted the statute to provide a “useful product defense” that applies if a seller sold a substance in the normal course of business, had no control over where the substance went, and did not have a contractual relationship with the facility from which the substance was released. See generally , Allan J. Topol & Rebecca Snow, Superfund Law & Procedure § 3.8.E.2 (1992). But see United States v. Aceto Agric. Chems.

When a major landfill is involved, the wide sweep of coverage tends to draw in a large number of geo - graphically dispersed defendants. The key issue becomes how to allocate the clean-up costs among defendants, any of whom may believe that they are being singled out to pay more than their fair share. The breadth of the statute and its recognition of contribution claims encourages lawyers and their clients to search out all PRPs and thereby reduce a client’s portion of the response costs. EPA typi - cally sues a limited number of PRPs, perhaps those it considers to be the major contributors who are able to pay. This approach leaves it to those parties to pur - sue their own third-party or contribution claims.

In practice, issues may cut across these phases. For example, liability and allocation of damages may be determined by the same evidence. Liability. Liability issues concern (1) whether the defendant is a present or former owner or operator of a facility or generator of hazardous waste, or a con - tractor or a transporter, (2) who is in some way responsible for the disposal of a hazardous substance at a facility, (3) from which there has been a release or threatened release of the substance into the environment, (4) leading the plaintiff to incur response costs consistent with the National Contingency Plan. Generally, there is little doubt about liability under CERCLA because, as outlined above, statutory defenses are quite narrow and because the act does not set a minimum threshold for liability. Disputes about whether a particular defendant qualifies as an owner, operator, arranger, or hauler may, of course, require factual develop - ment. Determination of remedy and damages. EPA has authority to issue an ad - ministrative order requiring parties to clean up the site, or EPA itself may clean up the site. If the site has been partially or fully cleaned up, EPA or a private party who incurred costs in cleaning a site may bring an action to recover those “response costs.” EPA administrative action in selecting a remedy is likely to be determinative, but there may be questions about whether costs incurred were necessary and there may be judicial review, based on the record at the agency level, of EPA’s choice of a cleanup plan. 1221 Disputes over damages may focus on whether the EPA remedy was necessary, that is, whether the costs of hiring an inspector or monitor to oversee the cleanup are recoverable, whether EPA’s over - 1219.

P. 27, to authorize the taking of prefiling depositions of percipient witnesses (and, when feasible, the production or preservation of documents and other tan - gible things). 1224 The same considerations may also persuade a court, once an action has been filed, to order the parties to preserve documents, records, and other tangible evidence and to make exceptions to a discovery plan and permit such depositions to be taken out of turn. 1225 Joining new parties. Incentives for defendants to round up all potentially re - sponsible parties (PRPs) can lead to a continuous parade of new parties. As a re - sult, the court will need to guard against indiscriminate joinder, perhaps by re - quiring the parties to set forth the factual basis for each joinder motion. The court may also need to control the timing of joinder. Each new party can be expected to want to catch up with discovery and motion practice, thereby de - laying trial. Furthermore, entry of a new party may create a conflict of interest for counsel or grounds for recusal by the judge. 1226 Controlling the entry of new parties will permit the court to control the size and shape of the litigation. Judges have used at least two approaches to address this problem. The recommended approach is to target the first phase of discovery at identi - fying all PRPs and developing information about the quantity and quality of waste that each produced during the history of the site. The court should set a 1222. See, e.g., United States v. Ottati & Goss, 900 F.2d 429, 443–45 (1st Cir. 1990). 1223. See, e.g. , R.W. Meyer , 932 F.2d 568. 1224. See In re Petition of Delta Quarries & Disposal, Inc., 139 F.R.D. 68 (M.D. Pa. 1991) (granting petition to depose ailing witness alleged to have personal knowledge of identity of com - panies that disposed hazardous substances at landfill fifteen years earlier). 1225. For an example of such an order, see Sample Order infra § 41.53. 1226. See United States v. New Castle County, 116 F.R.D. 19, 24 (D. Del. 1987) (denying motion to name and realign various parties; court notes that adding new parties after deadline would likely produce conflicts of interest for current counsel, would interfere with pretrial and trial case - management plans, and would likely disrupt settlement efforts)."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 371 reasonable but firm deadline, which could be as long as a year, for adding parties or cross claims or counterclaims. Once the deadline is reached, the parties and the court will have an overview of the size and scope of the litigation. Creating a cen - tral document depository or a computerized document storage system can help ensure that the newly joined parties have access to the product of prior discovery and can hold demands for additional discovery to a minimum. Once a court - imposed deadline for joining new parties has passed, pretrial, settlement, and trial plans can proceed, addressing issues relating to all the parties, while consideration of late presented claims is deferred. 1227 This approach may be conducive to reaching a global disposition of the entire litigation. Another approach is to postpone joinder issues, contribution claims, and other cross claims until after the litigation against the initial defendants has been resolved. In cases involving large numbers of PRPs, this approach may have the advantage of keeping the organization relatively simple while devising a plan to remedy the site or determine the costs of the remedy. The disadvantage, however, is that parties joined later may wish to relitigate those issues or reopen discovery. On the other hand, once the cases have been resolved as to the initial defendants, those defendants may be able to reach out-of-court settlements with third parties without the expense of litigation. CERCLA encourages the expedited settlement of disputes with parties whose contributions to the site have been minimal in terms of volume and toxicity or who are innocent purchasers that did not contribute to the problem (“ de min - imis ” parties). 1228 Pressing the EPA to define de minimis levels early may help control the size of the litigation and serve the congressional purpose of limiting transaction costs for such parties. Gathering related cases. The court and parties may need to make special ef - forts to identify cases and claims that are related to the CERCLA case. The initial pretrial order should call for the parties to identify and report any proceeding ar - guably related to the CERCLA case. Such proceedings may include state judicial or administrative proceedings to enforce CERCLA-type state laws, 1229 private claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, and the like, insurance coverage disputes in federal or state court, and bankruptcy proceedings. 1230 While 1227.

Other courts have rejected supplemental jurisdiction for state law claims to avoid unduly complicating the litigation. 1233 In considering whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in a case involving out - of-state defendants, the court should be aware of the constitutional, statu tory, and fairness issues that arise when nationwide service of process is used to obtain personal jurisdiction over parties to supplemental state law claims lacking an independent basis for federal jurisdiction. 1234 The court should also con sider the problems resulting from trying state and CERCLA claims together; a right to a jury trial may attach to state law claims, and the jury’s findings of fact may affect the outcome of what would otherwise be nonjury issues. 1235 In ad dition, the elements of state and CERCLA claims, while related, may be quite dif ferent.

Courts have approved their use for limited pretrial pur - poses. 1237 Use of special masters to preside at trial may be disapproved unless the parties consent. 1238 As discussed below in connection with settlement, the use of a magistrate judge, special master, or settlement judge may serve to insulate the judge from settlement negotiations in nonjury CERCLA cases. Organizing counsel. 1239 At the outset, the court will want to familiarize it self with the parties’ own efforts to organize themselves in response to EPA’s prelitigation investigation of the site. EPA sometimes encourages defendants to organize by refusing to entertain settlement discussions with individual PRPs. 1240 Such efforts may lead to a site study and settlement discussions with EPA. Faced with hundreds of parties in some CERCLA cases, organization of coun - sel is essential in order for the court to be able to communicate effectively with all parties. Because the ultimate issue turns on allocation of responsibility for re - sponse costs, and cross claims are the norm, conflicting interests are common and the court and the parties will need to be sensitive to the problems arising when parties with adverse claims (e.g., a third-party plaintiff and the third-party defen - dant it brought into the litigation) are included within the same group of parties. The type of organization may vary with its purpose and the issues in dispute. If the purpose is to organize parties with similar interests with respect to the legal issues, the court may want to use the groups identified in the statute: owners, op - erators, generators, contractors, and transporters, and, perhaps, subgroups based on the nature of the site, the time of use, the hazardous substances, or some other feature. 1241 Subject-matter subcommittees can be created to work on issues such 1236.

If the purpose is to create groups to facilitate settlement, relevant communi - ties of interests may be defined by the type of substance a group of parties sent to a site, the amount of hazardous wastes associated with the parties, the time peri - ods a group of parties used a site, or other common factors relating to geography, expert witnesses, records, or the like. For example, the court may want to con - sider combining all the major contributors in one tier, followed by a mid-level tier, and a de minimis tier. 1242 Organizing counsel and parties will avoid duplicate discovery and motion practice and give the court an individual liaison, or, at most, one for each group, to contact about scheduling and other nonsubstantive matters. One approach is to allow the parties to organize themselves, nominate lead and liaison counsel, propose a mode of payment, and tentatively define the authority of lead and liai - son counsel and a committee structure. It may be sufficient for the court to sug - gest these topics as an agenda for a meeting of counsel, review the results of the meeting, and issue an appropriate order implementing the results or modifying them as necessary. The court may also advise counsel of its guidelines, such as the avoidance of duplicative efforts (e.g., providing in a case-management order that a party waives its right to raise an issue unless it is first presented to a committee of counsel). This approach may be particularly suitable where the parties have or - ganized themselves to deal with the EPA before the litigation. The court should, however, independently review and evaluate any organizational arrangement among counsel to ensure that it meets the needs of the court for managing the litigation. For example, the judge may want to be sure that lead counsel for a group in fact represents one of the primary PRPs in that class. The judge, of course, retains the final authority whether to enter an order adopting the parties’ recommendations. Narrowing the issues. 1243 Case law allows courts to dispose summarily of many legal issues arising in CERCLA litigation, 1244 possibly including consti - tutional claims. 1245 Judicial decisions have given meaning to arcane terminol ogy in the statute. Many, perhaps most, of the initial ambiguities about the wide scope 1242. See, e.g., Denver v. Adolph Coors Co., 829 F. Supp. 340 (D. Colo. 1993) (order re garding approval of de minimis and mid-tier settlements). 1243. See also supra § 21.33. 1244. One commentator summarizes that federal courts “are shaping CERCLA by judicial interpretation to a degree rarely if ever seen for any other statute.” In the first ten years after the enactment of the Superfund, more than 1,000 reported decisions were handed down that bear on Superfund issues.

The initial conference generally should prune such dead wood. Standard rulings on identical issues raised by different parties may reduce dupli cation of effort. Requiring each side or group to meet and develop an agreed-on statement of the factual and legal issues in dispute and using the Rule 16 conference to clarify the factual and legal bases for the disputes should assist in identification of the genuinely controverted issues and the abandonment of marginal issues. Pressing the lawyers to identify facts supporting each element of each claim or defense and to tie the claim or defense to the legal framework of CERCLA may also help to re - veal the strengths and weaknesses of parties’ positions. Issues can then be outlined in a statement, rostered for the litigation in a logical and practical sequence, such as addressing first issues that might dispose of all or part of the litigation (e.g., whether the substances found at the site are hazardous, whether the government’s proposed remedy is reasonable and based on the record of decision, whether there is a nexus between actions of alleged generators of hazardous waste and the disposal of hazardous wastes at the specific site in question). Second- and third - tier issues can then be identified and incorporated into the case-management plan, which may also include a proposed structure for settlement discussions and for trial. Issues may be organized to conform to the liability, remediation, and al - location phases of CERCLA litigation described above. Managing motion practice. Building on the statement defining the issues, judges may group types of motions and call for filing of consolidated motions on similar issues according to a time schedule that will avoid duplicative and piece - meal motions. For example, the court may establish a brief window within which particular types of motions may be filed. 1247 The court may also want to direct that certain motions and third-party complaints be “deemed” to include all de - fendants (as it may want to direct that answers to third-party complaints be “deemed” to include cross claims and counterclaims against those defendants by third-party plaintiffs). 1248 1246. Some useful resources in finding the law relating to CERCLA include a three-volume loose-leaf set, Environmental Law Institute, Law of Environmental Protection (1993), and a two- volume set edited by private attorneys, Topol and Snow, supra note 1213.

At the lia - bility phase of the litigation, motions for partial summary judgment may be a way to weed out unmeritorious claims or defenses 1249 or, in a rare case, even to al - locate responsibility for paying the response costs. 1250 Evidentiary hearings un der Rule 43(e) may be used to determine if there is a genuine issue of material fact. Prompt rulings on motions are particularly important in CERCLA litigation because they can clarify liability and clear the path for the parties to allocate dam - ages among themselves. Where a primary party’s liability turns on a legal issue of first impression, the district court should consider the advantages of certifying its order on liability for interlocutory appeal before allocating damages against the disadvantages of delaying the progress of the case. 1251 When the subject of the interlocutory appeal is not central to the entire case, the court may decide to con - tinue with other aspects of the litigation while the appeal is pending. 1252 Informal exchanges. The EPA will often generate useful information before filing suit. This may take the form of the parties’ responses to requests for infor - mation under section 104(e) of CERCLA or even the official record of decision (ROD) created to determine the appropriate response under section 113(k). Ordering the EPA to produce this data will contribute to developing a database. CERCLA cases also present opportunities for courts to encourage or direct the parties to share information. For example, information relevant to the site provided to the EPA or another government agency will generally be available for immediate exchange. In cases with complex technical issues, it may be particu - counterclaims on parties whose liability is determined to be de minimis. To avoid imposing dispro - portionate risks of extensive liability on de minimis defendants, the court might consider exempting such parties from a “deeming” order. Another option would be to defer the time for filing cross claims until after de minimis parties have settled the claims against them and generally obtained the benefit of a bar against contribution claims as permitted under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(g)(2), (5). 1249.

To promote candid discus - sion, a case-management order can provide that discussions among groups of litigants will not constitute evidence of a conspiracy and that an expert’s inadver - tent disclosure of confidential information during such discussion will not waive trade-secret or attorney work-product protections. 1253 Managing discovery. CERCLA cases generally require structured discovery. Discovery should be planned to produce data that can be used for both settlement and trial. Creating a credible and accurate database with clear documentation of the problems at a site is a critical element of managing Superfund litigation. Such a database can be expected to provide a means of persuading parties to assume re - sponsibility for their documented contribution to the problem. Without a credi - ble database, the parties and the court cannot determine whether the proposed remedy is based on faulty assumptions about the nature of the problems, and the parties are not likely to accept proposed settlement allocations. 1254 The court may want to consider whether the complexity and demands of the case justify the appointment of a magistrate judge or special master to oversee discovery, apply - ing the criteria discussed in supra sections 20.14 and 21.5. The need for data about who contributed what to the problems at the facility coincides with the need to identify PRPs promptly. At an early stage, the court probably should focus the parties’ attention on identifying all PRPs and the bases of their liability. Later stages can concentrate on damages, methods of remedia - tion, and cleanup costs. All stages of discovery should be coordinated with plans for resolving motions and for structuring the trial (e.g., on a bifurcated or trifur - cated basis). Stages should not be so rigid as to require multiple depositions of the same parties or multiple searches for similar records. Centralized discovery management. The number of defendants in a typical case requires measures to avoid duplicative discovery, such as use of a master set of interrogatories for plaintiffs and defendants and prohibiting duplicative de - positions. 1255 Centralized document management, in the form of document depositories or computerized data storage and retrieval, will generally be neces - sary in CERCLA litigation because of the need to make past discovery easily ac - cessible to new parties. Electronic technology now provides the capacity for large 1253. For an example of such an order, see Sample Order infra § 41.53, ¶¶ 18–19. See also ¶ 17 for language protecting defendants against claims of conspiracy for cooperating in the litigation. 1254.

Simandle, Resolving Multi-Party Hazardous Waste Litigation , II Vill. Envtl. L. J. 111, 127–32 (1991). 1255. For an example of an order directing the EPA to produce its administrative record and ordering the parties to use master interrogatories and to coordinate depositions, see Sample Order infra § 41.53, ¶¶ 2, 10, and 12–13. See also supra §§ 21.45 and 21.46."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"378 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third volumes of documents to be imaged optically and distributed economically to the parties. 1256 Central document management may also provide a mechanism for allocating the cost of discovery fairly among its users. Managing expert testimony. CERCLA cases are prone to lead to battles of experts in highly technical areas, such as chemistry, hydrology, and geology. Continuous testing and sampling the soil and wastes at a given site may be neces - sary. At a minimum, courts should consider adopting procedures that will pro - duce a common database for the experts to analyze. For example, appointing an experts’ committee with responsibility for jointly defining issues, testing soil and allegedly hazardous materials, creating joint databases, developing proposed fac - tual stipulations, and splitting samples among the experts will help reduce un - productive adversariness and keep the focus on genuine issues. 1257 Some judges have directed the parties to have their experts meet without counsel to identify and consider the technical issues relating to the proposed remedial de sign. 1258 Such a meeting can uncover erroneous assumptions and avoid wasting resources on a remedy that might be technically flawed. Structuring the trial. CERCLA cases rarely go to trial, but when they do, the trial is likely to be complicated. 1259 Bifurcation or trifurcation into two or three phases—liability (if necessary), damages (remediation plans), and allocation of damages—should be considered. 1260 The order of trial (and of the correspond ing settlement discussions) can be varied to address dispositive issues first. Addressing challenges to the proposed remedy may crystallize issues relating to response costs and how they should be allocated. The EPA ordinarily has to de - termine the scope of proposed cleanup efforts before the court can allocate re - sponsibility for remediation. Except for natural resource damage claims, courts have held that parties are not entitled to a jury trial in CERCLA cases. 1261 One approach used in a case involving damages to natural resources, was to focus case management on 1256. See infra § 34 (courtroom technology) and supra § 21.44 (documents). 1257. See United States v. Price, 20 E.R.C. 2229 (D.N.J. 1984). See also supra § 21.48. 1258.

Setting firm trial dates and using other trial management procedures is presumed. 1264 See generally supra section 22. Facilitating settlements. 1265 CERCLA expressly encourages settlement, and the EPA has generally sought consent decrees to conclude CERCLA litigation. Judicial involvement may be needed to structure cases for settlement; organizing counsel as described above, for example, can be essential for creating a framework for bringing representatives of various interest groups together. Discovery should be designed to give the groups the information necessary to assess their liability, for example, to determine the volume and toxicity of substances sent to the site or to identify the costs and contributions of various parties to remedies. CERCLA cases present unique settlement challenges. A case does not end when the court determines or the parties agree as to the amount of damages or response costs. The court or the parties must allocate the total damages among a host of parties with different levels of responsibility. Allocations may have to ac - count for the reasonable cost of actions taken by some defendants to clean up the facility. To complicate matters further, the assessment and allocation of damages may not be final. The act limits the ability of the government to settle claims relat ing to future liability that might result from an unforeseen release of hazardous substance at the facility, for example, during the cleanup process. 1266 Thus, a settlement can generally be expected to include “reopeners.” A global settlement of a CERCLA claim resolves not only the parties’ mone - tary liability to each other but also their obligations to undertake remedial activi - ties at the site. In cases involving complex remediation plans, it may be useful for 1262. The district court in In re Acushnet River & New Bedford Harbor: Proceedings Re Alleged PCB Pollution, 712 F. Supp. 994 (D.

The Act permits the EPA to offer a covenant not to sue as well as a statutory bar against liability for contribution claims. 1269 If the EPA has not identified de minimis parties, the court may want to encourage the agency or the parties to do so and to define a de minimis volume of disposal. The statutory goal is to release such parties before transaction costs accumulate. As with most complex litigation, judicial approaches to use of settlement techniques or ADR differ widely. 1270 The magnitude of these cases and the possibility that recusal would impose a serious hardship on the entire court sug - gest that the trial judge should not be directly involved in settlement negotia - tions. 1271 Referral of settlement and pretrial management to a magistrate judge or a special master should be considered. Ruling on motions and facilitating dis - covery on central issues of liability and damages may promote settlement by giv - ing parties the information needed to evaluate cases. A settlement approach developed by one judge includes four major ele - ments: 1272 1. Setting the stage. The initial question is whether the parties have sufficient interest in pursuing settlement. If this process of “agreeing to seek to agree” succeeds, it will produce a written good faith agreement of most parties to pursue settlement of specified issues. 2. Organizing counsel and defining a timetable. Groups would be created along the lines discussed under “Organizing counsel” above (i.e., by se - lecting settlement liaison for each group of defendants and defining the authority of the liaisons). The initial task of the liaison and the groups is to define a timetable for the process. The timetable should be coordinated with the pretrial process and should adapt the discovery program to set - tlement needs. Whether to participate in the EPA’s formulation of the remedial design or to devise an alternative design is a threshold issue for consideration by the group. 1267.

Joining additional parties and creating a database. The database would consist primarily of data about the contributions of each party to the landfill along the lines discussed under “Managing discovery, ” above. Here, the emphasis is on identifying parties who contributed substantially to the problems and can be expected to contribute substantially to a financial settlement. The parties would then identify the information needed and develop the structure of a database, perhaps with the help of consultants hired jointly by the parties. Generally, information about in - surance would also be collected. 4. Allocating responsibility. This stage involves the hard negotiations. Using outside assistance—a special master, court-appointed mediator, or a con - sultant hired by the parties—in analyzing the data and recommending allocations may lend objectivity to the process. This process appears to have proved successful in major Superfund litigation. The role of the district court in the process is to rule promptly on those motions that define the liability of the parties and the contours of the issues. The district judge remains insulated from settlement discussions and is able to preside at a bench trial, if necessary. 33.8 Civil RICO 1273 .81 Pleadings 381 .82 Defining and Managing the Issues 382 .83 Related Litigation 389 .84 Discovery 390 .85 Final Pretrial Conference 390 .86 Trial 391 33.81 Pleadings The pleadings play an especially important role in civil RICO 1274 cases. Because RICO applies to a broad range of conduct, often occurring over an extended pe - riod of time and involving a large number of people or entities, the complaint will often assert numerous claims against numerous parties. Since most RICO com - plaints allege underlying acts of mail, wire, or securities fraud, which must be pleaded with particularity under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), the complaint may be lengthy and complex. The strict pleading requirements peculiar to RICO (discussed further below) may result in extensive motion practice directed at dismissing all or parts of the complaint.

Some courts have standing orders requiring parties alleging RICO claims to file RICO case statements, amplifying and clarifying the allegations in the pleading. In courts that do not, the court may adopt a case order requiring submission of such statements before responsive motions or pleadings are due. 1277 These statements, together with a careful reading of the complaint, will help narrow the issues and allow early identification of claims insufficient on their face, which may be dismissed (with or without prejudice) before significant time and effort is spent on them. The length and complexity of RICO complaints may justify granting defen - dants additional time to respond. The court should consider entering an order immediately following assignment of the litigation suspending the time for de - fendants to respond until after the initial conference. At the conference, counsel and the court may be able to narrow the issues, avoiding unnecessary motion practice. At the conclusion of the conference or shortly thereafter, the court should set a schedule for filing motions and opposing and reply briefs, as well as responsive pleadings. 33.82 Defining and Managing the Issues Efficient management of RICO litigation requires that the disputed legal and factual issues and the precise statutory violations alleged be identified and, where possible, narrowed, as early as possible. This is made difficult by the complexity of the RICO statute and the fact that the terms it employs, such as “person,” “enterprise,” “conduct,” and “pattern,” have been given varying and sometimes confusing interpretations. Reference to the four categories of unlawful conduct specified in 18 U.S.C. § 1962 will assist the process: 1. Section 1962(a): Investment of income. This subsection makes it unlaw - ful for “any person who has received any income derived . . . from a pat - tern of racketeering activity . . . to invest . . . any part of such income . . . in acquisition of an interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise . . . .” Most courts have ruled that the only injury compensable under § 1962(a) is that resulting from a defendant’s investment of racke - 1275. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (supplemental jurisdiction). 1276. See, e.g. , Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co. v. Dresser Indus., 972 F.2d 580, 584–90 (5th Cir. 1992); Spiegel v. Continental Ill. Nat.

See Sample Form infra § 41.54."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 383 teering income. 1278 Therefore, claims under § 1962(a) alleging injury resulting from racketeering activity alone, rather than from the invest - ment of income so derived, may be subject to early dismissal. 2. Section 1962(b): Interest/control . This subsection makes it unlawful for a person “to acquire or maintain . . . any interest in or control of any en - terprise” through a pattern of racketeering activity. Most courts have re - quired that the alleged injury to the plaintiff proximately result from the defendant’s acquisition of an interest in, or control over, an enter- prise. 1279 If the complaint does not allege injury arising specifically from such an acquisition, § 1962(b) claims may be subject to dismissal. 3. Section 1962(c): Conduct of an enterprise. Most civil RICO claims are filed under § 1962(c), which makes it unlawful to “conduct or partici pate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct” of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The four primary elements of this sub section, as set out by the Supreme Court, are “(1) conduct (2) of an en terprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” 1280 The in terpretation of the first three of these requirements (the fourth is rela tively uncontroversial) is shrouded in considerable uncertainty, only some of which has been resolved by the Court. The judge should there fore give early attention to determining the definitions applied in the cir cuit. • “Conduct.” The Supreme Court has ruled that liability for “participat[ing]” in the “conduct” of the enterprise extends only to those who “have some part in directing [the enterprise’s] affairs,” adopting the “operation or management” test articulated by the Eighth Circuit. 1281 The defendant need not be in upper management; liabil ity may extend to lower-level employees under the direction of upper management, persons associated with the enterprise who exert control over it (for example, by bribery), and outsiders who participate in the operation or management of the enterprise. 1282 Nevertheless, the al - 1278.

In some cases, a Rule 12 motion or a motion for sum - mary judgment may be an appropriate vehicle to resolve this is sue. 1283 • “Enterprise” and “Person.” Most courts have ruled that § 1962(c) was designed to punish only the persons who run an enterprise illegally and not the enterprise itself, which often will be an innocent victim of the racketeering activity. 1284 Therefore, § 1962(c) requires pleading and proof of two separate entities—a “person” and an “enterprise”—with only the “person” being liable for damages. 1285 Three different theo ries have been used to attempt to reach the assets of a corporate enter prise despite this requirement: (1) affiliated corporations; (2) vicarious liability; and (3) association-in-fact enterprises. Circuit law has been divided on these issues. Some courts have ruled that a subsidiary is an “affiliated corporation,” which conducts the affairs of its separate par - ent corporation, and thus can be held liable for damages under § 1962(c). 1286 By contrast, all of the federal appeals courts that have considered the issue have held that an employer alleged to be the RICO “enterprise” cannot be held vicariously liable under § 1962(c) for the acts of its employees. 1287 Claims alleging the existence of “association - 1283.

Note, however, that"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Application in Particular Types of Litigation 385 in-fact enterprises” pose a more difficult problem, and may not be appropriate for summary resolution under Rule 12(b)(6) or 56. RICO provides that an enterprise may be composed of “any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal en tity.” 1288 A RICO enterprise must, however, be a continuing unit that has some type of organization and constitutes an entity separate and apart from the alleged pattern of racketeering; 1289 claims alleging association-in-fact enterprises have been dismissed on pretrial motions for failure to allege the requisite continuity, or for failure to identify an enterprise that is more than a corporate entity and its agents conduct ing their regular business. 1290 • “Pattern.” The Supreme Court’s most recent attempt to define the “pattern” requirement was in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. , in which it ruled that proving a pattern requires showing that the racketeering acts “are related” and “amount to or pose the threat of continued criminal activity.” 1291 The Court defined “related” acts as those “that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, vic - tims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by dis - tinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.” 1292 The Court defined “continuity” to require either “a closed period of re peated some courts permit vicarious liability where an employer is benefited by its employees’ § 1962(c) violations, if the employer is distinct from the enterprise. See, e.g. , Brady v. Dairy Fresh Prods. Co., 974 F.2d 1149, 1154 (9th Cir. 1992); Petro-Tech, 824 F.2d at 1361–62. Vicarious liability has also been found proper under other subsections of § 1962. See, e.g. , Quick v. Peoples Bank of Cullman County, 993 F.2d 793, 797–98 (11th Cir. 1993) (§ 1962(b)). See generally A Proposal for the Application of Vicarious Liability Under Civil RICO (American College of Trial Lawyers 1994). 1288. 18 U.S.C. §1961(4). While some have argued that this definition limits associations-in-fact to groups of individuals, that argument has found little support in the decisions. See, e.g. , Atlas Pile Driving Co. v. DiCon Fin. Co., 886 F.2d 986, 995 n.7 (8th Cir. 1989); Shearin v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 885 F.2d 1162, 1165–66 (3d Cir. 1989). But see In re Tucker Freight Lines, Inc., 789 F. Supp. 884, 893 (W.D.

First, where the allegations involve completed (“closed-ended”) conduct lasting twelve months or less, and where there is no threat of future criminal conduct, courts have dismissed the claims on motions to dismiss or for summary judgment. 1295 Second, courts have held that claims involving only a single (or a few) victims cannot pose a threat of long-term criminal conduct, and should be dismissed even where the conduct complained of lasted for many months or even years. 1296 In other cases, courts have applied a multifactor test to de termine whether a pattern of racketeering activity has been pleaded or proved. The factors considered typically include the nature, number, and variety of predicate acts; the duration or time span involved; 1297 the number of victims; the number of separate transactions involving unlawful conduct; and the presence of distinct injuries. 1298 1293.

SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1516 (10th Cir. 1990). 1297. In gauging the duration in cases charging mail or wire fraud, some courts have held that only the duration of the fraudulent acts is relevant, and that innocent mailings may not be con - sidered.

This subsection makes it unlawful to con - spire to violate the previous three. To state a claim under § 1962(d), a plaintiff must plead that the defendant agreed to join the conspiracy, agreed to commit predicate acts, and knew that those acts were part of a pattern of racketeering activity. 1299 The agreement to commit predicate acts, standing alone, is not enough. 1300 There is a circuit split on two important issues under § 1962(d). First, some courts have held that a RICO conspiracy claim may be stated where a plaintiff is injured by any acts that further a RICO conspiracy, 1301 while others require that the acts complained of all be predicate acts as defined by § 1961. 1302 Second, some courts require that a defendant agree to commit at least two predicate acts, 1303 while others hold that it is sufficient if a defen dant agreed that some member of the enterprise would commit the predicate acts. 1304 • Additional issues.

The procedures for consolidation or coordination discussed in supra section 31 should therefore be considered, as appropriate. Because criminal racketeering activity is an element of civil RICO li - ability, civil RICO defendants will often be, or have been, the subject of criminal investigation or prosecution.

Where criminal and civil RICO cases are proceeding concurrently, the criminal charges should ordinarily be tried first, without a general stay being im - posed in the civil action (see supra section 31.2). If related cases have been concluded, the trial judge must consider potential claim and issue preclusion. RICO provides that a final judgment in favor of the United States in a criminal proceeding shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense in any civil proceeding brought by the United States. 1318 The statute is silent on the use of such convictions in civil cases brought by private parties, but courts may still apply claim and issue preclusion. 1319 Preclusion may also arise from prior civil litigation, whether in federal or state court. 1320 Prior administrative proceedings 1321 or arbitration awards 1322 may also be accorded preclusive effect.

Different burdens of proof, 1324 inability to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding, 1325 or lack of knowledge regarding the facts re quired to allege a RICO violation 1326 may prevent application of preclusion doctrines in a civil RICO action. 33.84 Discovery The specific elements required to prove a RICO violation may pose special prob - lems in discovery. The “pattern” requirement may involve discovery into a RICO defendant’s conduct and practices over an extended period of time and with re - spect to numerous transactions. The existence of related criminal proceedings may raise issues such as the defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination and the discoverability of grand jury material (see supra section 21.491). Civil RICO claims may also require discovery involving foreign countries (see supra section 21.494). These issues must be addressed early in the litigation, before depositions begin, in order to avoid unnecessary conflict and discovery motions. To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, a civil RICO plaintiff must al - lege separate predicate acts that are both related and pose a threat of continu- ity. 1327 While discovery into unrelated alleged criminal acts should therefore ordinarily not be permitted, 1328 courts must be careful not to curtail unduly a plaintiff’s discovery into alleged wrongdoing, especially where it relates to other alleged victims of the same pattern of racketeering activity or to acts within the exclusive knowledge of the defendant. 1329 33.85 Final Pretrial Conference 1330 It may not be possible to determine the sufficiency of some RICO claims until the parties have conducted discovery.

The parties should attempt to reach stipulations where possible; where disagree - ments remain, motions for summary judgment, filed in advance by a specified deadline, can be resolved or at least considered at the conference. If the elimina - tion of RICO or other federal claims removes the jurisdictional basis for supple - mental state law claims, the court should decide whether it will retain jurisdiction over those claims. 33.86 Trial Some of the technical issues in civil RICO trials may be particularly confusing to lay jurors. The court should therefore explain to the jurors the general nature of the claims. This should be done at an early stage, either during voir dire or before the parties’ opening statements (see supra sections 22.41, 22.43). In addition to briefly noting the general nature of the case, the court should outline some of the characteristics and elements of a civil RICO case. These include the fact that the case is a civil action, not a criminal proceeding; that the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt; 1331 and that the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant is a “racketeer” in the everyday sense of that term or is associated with “organized crime.” The court should urge the parties to submit a joint set of preliminary comments or instructions for this purpose. To avoid confusion, and to direct the jurors’ attention to the sufficiency of each separate statutory and common law claim submitted for their decision, spe - cial verdicts or a general verdict with interrogatories should usually be employed (see supra sections 21.633, 22.34, 22.451). Issues may be submitted to the jury for decision sequentially, both to simplify deliberations and to obviate deliberation on issues rendered moot by an earlier verdict. Some courts have held that the jury should not be informed that damages awarded on a RICO verdict will automati - cally be trebled. 1332 1331. See, e.g. , Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

While the impetus for the use of technology in a given case will generally come from counsel, the judge can both encourage and control it as appropriate. Considerations such as the de - sirability of technology in presenting the issues effectively and the balance of costs and benefits will come into play. Where substantial disparity exists in the litigants’ respective resources, fairness will be an important consideration. If technology is to be shared or used for common benefit, arrangements for the allocation of costs may be needed. Deploying technology will often require physical arrangements as well; the court should ensure coordination among the parties in making the nec - essary arrangements, including adequate opportunity to install and test equip - ment. Ground rules to address such matters should be developed early in the liti - gation, before substantial investments have been made. What follows is a basic description of some of the technologies becoming available for courtroom use, along with ways in which they can be used, their ad - vantages and disadvantages, and related considerations. The speed with which technology advances could render any more specific information obsolete by the time it is published; additional, more specific, and current information may be available to judges from the Office of Judges’ Programs of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. 1333. With acknowledgments to Donald E. Vinson, Ph.D., and Roger L. McCarthy, Ph.D."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"394 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 34.1 Functions and Benefits • Promoting economy. Litigation often requires the processing and use of vast amounts of information. Technology allows great quantities of data to be efficiently stored, transported, and accessed. • Aiding analysis. Litigation requires not only the collection of facts but also their analysis and interpretation. Technology can improve the speed and accuracy of factual analysis. • Fostering visual perception. Technology has led the public to depend on and expect the sophisticated production and display of visual informa - tion. In general, visual displays convey more information than audio recordings or writings read aloud (e.g. , a deponent’s demeanor) and in - crease jury attention, comprehension, and retention. For example, com - puter-aided simulation substantially aids witnesses, juries, and judges in reconstructing events with precision and in detail. 34.2 Safeguards Courtroom technology may be subject to abuse and manipulation; basic safe - guards should be employed to ensure integrity and fairness: • Judicial training. Familiarity with the capabilities of various technological aids will help judges anticipate pitfalls and potentials for abuse. • Independent experts. Courts may call on independent experts for advice on questions pertaining to specific uses of technology (see supra section 21.51). • Guidelines . Explicit guidelines should be developed to govern the use of technology in the courtroom. Judges have substantial discretion to ex - clude inappropriate or misleading technological applications. 34.3 Technologies Available for Courtroom Use .31 Video 395 .32 Computer Animation 397 .33 Laser Discs 398 .34 CD-ROM 400 .35 Electronic or Digitized Still Photographs 401 .36 Photogrammetry 402 .37 Personal Computers 403 .38 Computer-Aided Transcription (CAT) 404 .39 Simultaneous Distributed Translation (SDT) 405"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Courtroom Technology 395 34.31 Video What it is: Among the technologies available for courtroom use, video technology may be the most familiar to, and widely used by, the public. Video camera recorders (VCRs) and videotape recorders (also usually called VCRs in lay terminology) are widely available and come in “VHS” and “8 mm” format; the primary difference between the two is the smaller size of the 8 mm tapes. The two formats and their hardware are currently incompatible; most VCRs in the home and office are VHS. How it is used: Video camera recorders are the functional equivalent of movie cameras, with one key difference: instead of exposing film to light, they translate light into elec - tronic signals which are recorded on videotape or broadcast “live” for display on monitors (“monitors” are video display screens, like television screens but with - out the “tuners” found in television sets that allow them to pick up broadcast sig - nals—only a monitor is needed to play videotapes; the screens used with personal computers are also “monitors”). In addition to their home and office use, more sophisticated and expensive VCRs are utilized by television news programs for virtually all news stories seen in a broadcast. Videotape recorders can play video - tapes and record images and sounds directly from a television broadcast for play - back at a later time. Strengths and benefits of video technology: • Cost: Video camera recorders and videotape recorders are relatively inex - pensive. • User-friendly : VCRs are easy to use. Most cameras are auto-focus and can record for several hours at a time on a single battery and tape; many now produce tapes instantly ready for insertion into a videotape player for playback. Even the presence of a human being is not required: video cameras can be set up to record unattended for long periods of time, and videotape recorders can be programmed to record during a specified time period. • Low potential for abuse: The nature of “analog” video technology makes it very difficult to alter video images without leaving a trace. Videotape which has been edited or otherwise tampered with will show obvious signs of alteration. Moreover, the video quality declines with each gen - eration of a copied tape. An original analog videotape is therefore a reli - able record. Newer “digital” VCR technology will, however, make alter - ations harder to detect. (Unlike analog technology, where a signal is recorded or transmitted in essentially its original form, digital recording equipment translates sounds and images into a string of 0s and 1s, which digital playback equipment can read and retranslate for display. This re -"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"396 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third sults in a higher quality image, but one that can be edited relatively easily by simply rearranging the sequence of 0s and 1s.) • Facilitate court “appearances”: Conferences and hearings can be held by live video conferencing (like a conference call, but with visual display in addition) instead of requiring attorneys or other participants to travel to the courthouse, reducing fees and minimizing inconvenience. In criminal cases, live video conferencing can permit the defendant to participate in a pretrial proceeding without having to be transported from his place of custody, though this may implicate rule-based and constitutional con - cerns. 1334 • Video record of court proceedings: VCR technology permits the court and the parties to acquire a full video record of the trial proceedings. A video record may be more complete and accurate than a mere transcript. Only a few state courts now permit video recording; it is not currently allowed in federal courts. • Presentation of evidence. When monitors are available in the courtroom, exhibits and other evidence can be conveniently displayed; videotape might be used, for example, to demonstrate the operation of a patented device or the appearance of a scene or location relevant to the litigation. Potential limitations and abuses: • Privacy: The beneficial attributes of VCR technology—relatively low cost, simple mechanics, and widespread availability—may also prove to be drawbacks, particularly in the area of individual privacy rights. Used as a surveillance tool, the VCR is an efficient method of monitoring various environments for security purposes; this function, however, risks intrud - ing on the privacy interests of employees or innocent bystanders. The court should use its discretion to exclude or require redaction of video recordings that improperly impinge on a person’s privacy. • Image quality: Current video technology captures a relatively low quality of image, with less than 1/20th the detail of a 35 mm photograph. Also, the range of video quality varies greatly, depending on the type of equip - 1334. See Valenzuela-Gonzales v. District Ct., 915 F.2d 1276, 1277–81 (9th Cir. 1990) (arraignment via closed-circuit television violates Fed. R. Crim. P. 43, absent showing of necessity); United States v.

It does not possess the archival quality of pa - per, photographs, and film; currently, videotape has a shelf-life of approximately five to ten years. 34.32 Computer Animation What it is: Computer-generated animation (or simulation) is similar to the more famil - iar film animation, which is created by a series of hand-painted scenes on cellu - loid (later transferred to film) displayed in rapid sequence, creating the illusion of motion. Computer animation achieves the same effect with a series of still images, but without actually filming real events or scenes, avoiding the laborious process of hand painting. Instead, individual frames are generated by a computer and stored in a magnetic or alternative format, and then played back at twenty-four frames per second on a monitor. How it is used: Computer animation can be used to create simulations in the form of visual, moving-image reconstructions of actual scenes and events that were not recorded (or recorded insufficiently), or of events that did not actually occur or things that do not currently exist, for example to present a hypothetical scenario or illustrate the design and function of a product not yet manufactured. Strengths and benefits of computer animation: • Creative control: Computer animation allows the creator to absolutely control what appears—or does not appear—in each computer-generated frame. Even the laws of physics and the constraints of the rational mind can be abandoned to create what the animator desires. • Visualization of abstract concepts or difficult-to-observe events: Since the animator has complete creative control over the images, abstract con - cepts can be presented visually. Minute, split-second, or slowly occurring physical processes can be presented in a manner that facilitates observa - tion. Abstract or complex scientific processes and evidence can be illus - trated clearly, enhancing comprehension. • Repeated use: Libraries of “stock” animation can be developed for ready availability, reducing cost and effort. Potential limitations and abuses: • Cost: Computer animations require vast amounts of information and de - tail from the animator, making this technology currently relatively ex -"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"398 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third pensive (compared, for example, to video technology). Advances in com - puter animation will likely reduce the cost. • Requires a “guide”: Displaying animation requires a person to access the technology via computer or videotape and then guide the viewers through what they are seeing. • Reality compromised: Computer animation, like its film counterpart, can rarely appear truly “real.” Since the animator possesses creative control over the end-product, it must be remembered that computer-animated images are ultimately human-created and thus susceptible to human bi - ases. • Foundational requirement: Computer animation, like any other repre - sentational evidence, is inadmissible without a proper foundation (see supra section 21.642). The proponent may be required to present both the factual information relied on and the process by which this informa - tion was used to produce the animation. Experts such as engineers and scientists may be required to testify about technical and scientific matters. To save trial time, the court should encourage the parties to stipulate to authenticity after making their own examination or resolve the issue by pretrial hearing under Fed. R. Evid. 104. Note that, since animation is merely a series of still pictures, traditional means of establishing a foun - dation for still images may be employed. • Medium overpowers the message?: The powerful impression left by computer animation may be difficult for an opposing party to overcome. Once jurors view the animation, it can become difficult to persuade them to accept a different version of events. If requested, the judge may caution the jury about the weight to give such evidence. The judge may also need to consider under Fed. R. Evid. 403 whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. Where the opposing party lacks the resources to respond in kind, particular attention needs to be given to the fairness of the presentation. 34.33 Laser Discs What they are: Laser discs, like CD-ROMs, are a form of optical disc. Laser disc technology allows an enormous amount of information to be stored in digital form on a portable twelve-inch disc. Approximately 50,000 video frames with audio (about thirty minutes of continuous playing at 30 frames per second) can be conve - niently stored on a single disc. How they are used: A laser disc player reads this information with a laser beam and reproduces it on a monitor. Because (unlike film or videotape) the information is stored digi -"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Courtroom Technology 399 tally, frame numbers may be coded at the time of production and thereafter re - trieved instantaneously by scanning a light pen over a bar code that can be gen - erated by any common laser printer. Strengths and benefits of laser disc technology: • Efficient all-in-one storage: Virtually any type of documentary, graphic, taped, or animated evidence can be stored on a laser disc. Laser discs streamline the presentation of evidence by eliminating the often unwieldy nature of voluminous papers and bulky trial binders. Charts and graphs are easily called up on the monitor. Laser discs also eliminate the often awkward and time-consuming searches for exhibits and other papers during trial. • Recorded testimony: Videotaped depositions can be stored on laser discs and rapidly retrieved for direct comparison with in-court testimony. This allows selected portions of a deposition to be recalled and shown almost instantly, in any desired order, without the need for pretrial editing or time-consuming fast-forwarding and rewinding at trial. • Higher quality display than CD-ROM: Information on laser discs gen - erally is not “compressed,” as it is on CD-ROM, resulting in a higher quality image. Laser discs are therefore superior to CD-ROM for full - screen video display of complex or detailed images. • Low cost/user friendly: Laser disc technology is relatively inexpensive and widely available, and information retrieval is easy, requiring little training or guidance. Potential limitations and abuses: • Less information storage than CD-ROM: Because information stored on a laser disc is generally not “compressed,” a laser disc cannot store as much information as a CD-ROM. • Lower image quality than printing: Images stored on laser discs are re - trieved to a monitor, a device inferior in detail to printed charts and graphs. High-definition monitors will ultimately resolve this difference, but the technology is still developing, and is therefore expensive (though it can be rented). In some cases, therefore, charts and graphs may be the preferred medium for displaying important information. • Complex production: Laser disc production is a complex process requir - ing sophisticated video-editing capabilities. It is almost always performed by a vendor."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"400 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 34.34 CD-ROM What it is: CD-ROMs (“compact disc—read only memory”), like laser discs, are a type of optical disc. Each 12 cm (4.71\") disc can store approximately 635 million bytes of digital data—the equivalent of a twenty-four-volume encyclopedia. While in - formation retrieval is easy, discs are difficult to produce—they are usually created at specially equipped facilities, though emerging (and costly) technology allows individual users to create their own. Once information is written onto a disc, it cannot be deleted to make room to store new information, but can only be read (thus “read only” memory). More advanced “rewritable” optical drives allow in - formation to be stored on, and retrieved or erased from, optical discs (as with computer disks). 1335 How it is used: CD-ROM technology can be used to store and retrieve audio and video in - formation, including the entire range of documentary data—briefs, business records, charts, graphs, and photographs. As with laser discs, specific information can be accessed quickly, usually by entering a code on the unit or a remote con - trol device. Visual images are retrieved on computer or television monitors. Strengths and benefits of CD-ROM technology: • Affordability/familiarity: CD-ROM technology has been on the market for several years and is relatively inexpensive. The equipment used for re - trieving data from compact discs is widely available and familiar to many consumers, and will soon be available on most personal computers. • Easy access: Data on CD-ROM can be retrieved almost instantly. In conjunction with a computer, the data can be searched (by, for example, name, date, or specific wording) for rapid retrieval of desired informa - tion, even if not precoded for retrieval by code. • Durability: Compact discs are highly durable. Unlike with tapes or even floppy disks, the information stored on compact discs is fairly difficult to damage or destroy through everyday use. Compact discs are therefore highly archival. • Compactness: The information on CDs is “compressed” to increase the amount that can be stored. They therefore can hold even more informa - tion than current laser discs, despite being much smaller, facilitating transport and storage. • Commonplace: The proliferation of compact discs in the recording in - dustry has made this technology familiar to the American consumer. 1335. See Charles Piller, Optical Update , MacWorld, Nov. 1992, at 124."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Courtroom Technology 401 • User-friendly: Use of a CD player or personal computer to retrieve in- formation from a CD does not require elaborate training or instructions. Potential limitations or abuses: • No standardized retrieval system: Each compact disc contains its own access program that must be loaded into the memory of the CD player or computer. Storage and access formats are not yet standardized in CD - ROM technology. • Relatively “slow”: By computer standards, CD-ROM retrieval is slow, re - quiring about a half-second for access to the desired information, al - though speeds are increasing. • Display inferior to laser discs: Because, unlike on laser discs, information on CD-ROM is “compressed,” the video image displayed is less sharp. This may change with advancing technology. 34.35 Electronic or Digitized Still Photographs What they are: Electronic (or digitized) “photographs” are images captured on discs rather than on light-sensitive film. These images can then be retrieved on television or computer monitors and transferred to CD-ROM discs for permanent storage. In contrast, conventional photography employs film chemically treated to produce a “negative” when exposed to the proper light conditions, which is then used to produce color or black-and-white prints on paper (the “positive” image). How they are used: Electronic/digitized photography serves the same purpose as conventional photography—to capture images—but does not require chemical development and may be reproduced on monitors. The photographs can be easily accessed and enlarged by computer. Strengths and benefits of electronic photographs: • Electronic enhancement: The primary benefit of this technology is the ability to improve the quality of photographs and manipulate the images in them. Unlike with conventional photography, a poor quality photo - graph can be “enhanced” by computer to produce a higher quality image. • Greater depth of field: Compared to conventional photography, elec - tronic photographs typically produce clear images of objects located within a greater range of distance. • Laser printed: In addition to video display, electronic photographs can be printed by a personal computer attached to a color laser printer. • Efficient storage: Electronic photographs may be stored on durable discs and quickly retrieved on video display monitors or printed."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"402 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third Potential limitations and abuses: • Reduced image detail: Compared to conventional photographs, elec - tronic images capture far less detail. The common 35 mm photograph is able to register approximately ten times more image detail than an elec - tronic/digitized image. Technological advances should soon enable elec - tronic photography to match the level of detail achieved by conventional photography. • Alteration: Electronic photographs can be altered without leaving a trace (unlike conventional photographs). The court must therefore use special care when electronic photographs are offered in evidence. As with any photograph, authentication should be made by testimony of a knowl - edgeable witness that the photograph accurately represents the matter in question. The judge may also, however, require the proponent to estab - lish a chain-of-custody, with each custodian testifying that the photo - graph was not altered. • Expense: The equipment used to produced electronic photography is currently much more expensive and complex than equipment used in conventional photography. 34.36 Photogrammetry What it is: Photogrammetry is not a single technology but rather a method of obtaining quantitative information about physical objects by interpreting photographs. For example, photogrammetric techniques have been used to compile topographic maps from aerial and space photographs. Recent advances in computer software programs make it possible to reconstruct accidents and other events based on an extrapolation of information available in photographs. How it is used: Computer-aided photogrammetry is useful in reconstructing accidents by analyzing photographs of the accident site. Software programs use mathematical concepts to establish precise relationships between objects in a photograph and to retrieve three-dimensional data about those objects. Information obtained di - rectly from an accident site can be checked against the data extracted in pho - togrammetric analysis. Strengths and benefits of photogrammetry: • Permanent record for analysis: Photographs taken soon after an event may be analyzed at a later date using photogrammetry techniques. Thus, photographs become a permanent record of important information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain long after occurrence."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Courtroom Technology 403 • Reconstruction: Photogrammetry can be used to reconstruct information that might not be available directly from the site. For example, the length of skid marks and the three-dimensional crash profile of vehicles may be determined using photogrammetric techniques. Potential limitations or abuses: • Poor photographic image: Photogrammetric techniques interpret infor - mation provided by a photograph; if the image is poor or otherwise lacking in important data, photogrammetry may be of limited help in ex - tracting the desired information. 34.37 Personal Computers What they are: Personal computers (PCs) are desktop or notebook (“laptop”) computers that run programs or use communications technology to access online informa - tion resources and communicate directly with other PC users. Information stor - age and retrieval may be on internal “hard” disks or on portable “floppy” disks (floppy disks currently come in two sizes, 5.25\" and 3.5\", with the former being phased out; the latter-sized disk, despite its name, is nonflexible). The personal computer is used in conjunction with all of the technology discussed above. How they are used: In the courtroom, attorneys are increasingly using lap-top computers to take trial notes. Personal computers can also be used to project images on monitors or scan photographs or text. In this respect, a basic personal computer can drive an entire in-court presentation. Strengths and benefits of personal computers: • Versatility/ability to go “online”: PCs can run a wide variety of software programs and, when equipped with a modem (a device that allows a PC to make and receive telephone calls and data transmissions), can access many online information services (Lexis and Westlaw are the two most familiar examples), including entire libraries. Indeed, a database accessi - ble by PC can be created for large-scale litigation to store and provide ac - cess to filings, eliminating the need for costly copying and individual ser - vice on numerous parties, and to provide an “electronic bulletin board” for low-cost dissemination of other information. 1336 See also supra section 21.444 (document depositories). • Display: In a litigation setting, PCs can use monitors to display and high - light evidentiary and demonstrative exhibits. 1336. See Robert J. Katzenstein, CLAD: Delaware’s Paperless Docket, 20 Litig. 37 (ABA Winter 1994)."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"404 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third • Searchability: Information stored on a PC can be accessed and retrieved easily and quickly, because of the PC’s ability to rapidly search large amounts of data for desired information. • Affordability: PCs and the software they run have become relatively in - expensive. Potential limitations or abuses: • Limited power and memory: Personal computers are limited in size, memory, and power. Full-screen video, film, and animation cannot be run on most PCs, though this technology is available and developing. • Tampering: Programs that run on PCs can be tampered with, thus alter - ing the computational ability and the results of any analyses. • Risk of lost material: PC users risk accidentally losing their material if it is not properly saved to hard or floppy disks or, for even greater security, backed-up on computer tape. This risk can be reduced by regular saving and backing-up. • Viruses: PCs and their software are vulnerable to “viruses” (programs designed to spread throughout the system) that may interfere with nor - mal computing or destroy data. A range of antiviral programs is available to combat this risk. • Distraction: Some judges find the use of PCs distracting, particularly in a jury trial. Courtroom use of PCs should therefore be cleared in advance. 34.38 Computer-Aided Transcription (CAT) What it is: A computer-aided transcription (CAT) system using “realtime” technology can translate a court reporter’s keystroke patterns and custom abbreviations to create a readable English transcript of the proceeding almost instantaneously. The text is saved in a computer file for easy search and retrieval, even as the trial is proceeding. How it is used: A court reporter using CAT and realtime software can immediately provide counsel and the court (directly if their PCs are on the same network, otherwise on a floppy disk) with all the testimony during that court day, searchable on a key word basis, in highly complete and accurate form. Editing to eliminate “first-cut” errors will be needed to produce a final version, but a draft transcript can be available almost immediately. For greater speed, a “scopist” can work on produc - ing a certified transcript while the court reporter is working in the courtroom. Trial counsel and the court can use this system for speedy review and retrieval of trial testimony, and counsel may even maintain a running electronic transcript of the entire trial on their PC."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Courtroom Technology 405 Strengths and benefits of computer aided transcription: • Faster turnaround: CAT dramatically increases the speed at which a tran - script is produced, permitting prior testimony to be used at trial without a waiting period. • More efficient: A transcript of an entire trial day can be created almost immediately, while daily transcripts have previously required two or three reporters working together. Potential limitations and abuses: • First cut errors: Even with the best CAT system, the “first cut” of the day’s testimony will contain a few errors or incorrect phonic transcrip - tions. These can generally be corrected easily and quickly. • Multiple versions: If trial counsel is given a copy of the CAT file before the court reporter’s edits are incorporated, there will be two (or more) slightly different versions of the transcript in existence, potentially caus - ing confusion. • Special system required: The plain stenograph producing all paper out - put is unusable in this process. A new stenograph is required that records all the key strokes on a disk, or sends them directly to a computer. Specialized software for the translation of stenographic key strokes is also required. These costs will generally be offset by the resulting savings. 34.39 Simultaneous Distributed Translation (SDT) What it is: When a courtroom proceeding involves a number of non-English speaking participants, substantial economies can be achieved with simultaneous dis tributed translation (SDT) of foreign languages. This translation technique, pio neered by the United Nations, is now in regular use in a number of courts. SDT requires a single translator (for each foreign language) who is present in court translating the proceeding in “real time” by speaking into a “mask” (a micro phone with added protection to contain the speaker’s voice) of the type traditionally used to produce an audio transcript of court proceedings. The output of the recorder attached to the mask is fed to an amplification and distribution sys tem that permits anyone given headphones to listen to the translation as it is spo ken. The headphones are often wireless, facilitating broad distribution. How it is used: This technique permits a single translator to translate for many people under - standing the same language, at the same time creating a record of the translation. It is used to eliminate multiple translators who inevitably produce multiple, slightly differing translations, and to avoid the distracting, error-prone, and po -"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"406 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third tentially dangerous practice of having translators sit next to the person needing translation and whispering into that person’s ear. Strengths and benefits of simultaneous distributed translations: • Economy: SDT can significantly reduce the number of translators needed. Only one translator is required for each foreign language. Where several foreign languages need to be simultaneously translated and dis - tributed, multiple translators, all speaking into masks, do not interfere with one another. • Speed: When the translation is done audibly by a single translator in open court, the length of the proceeding is extended since every word must be spoken twice; SDT provides simultaneous translation. • Uniformity: SDT ensures that all listeners understanding the same lan - guage receive the same translation. • Recordability: Translation given in whispers to a number of different parties is not reflected on the record, whereas with SDT the translator’s exact words can be captured for the record. Potential limitations and abuses: • Translator skill: It requires a particularly skillful translator to listen and translate at the same time. The court should ensure the competence of proposed translators prior to the proceeding. All methods of translation, however, have common problems of lack of accuracy. • Custom wiring: Most courtrooms are not equipped with microphone jacks at counsel tables and other locations where people are seated; these must be installed in advance. The hardware and wiring involved is, how - ever, simple, inexpensive, and readily available. Wireless SDT technology is also widely available. • Headphones: Because the translations are heard via headphones, the court has to speak loudly enough to get the attention of participants wearing headphones who may not be looking at the judge. 34.4 Overview of Issues and Concerns When considering the use of courtroom technology, judges should keep the fol - lowing considerations in mind: • Unfair advantage : Whether actual or perceived, the advantages a party may gain by access to expensive, sophisticated devices must be weighed in formulating policies for courtroom use of technology. This is a particular concern when one party can afford to use technology and another can - not. Traditionally, parties able to afford superior representation have been allowed to exercise that advantage freely; indeed, for the court to do otherwise might be considered a violation of the party’s rights. Whether"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"Courtroom Technology 407 this principle extends to the use of technology is a question not yet fully resolved. Nevertheless, because technology can possess persuasive power not always obvious to the observer, the court should be aware of and guard against the risk of unfairness arising from its use. • Distraction: Technology can at times create a spectacle distracting jurors from the legal and factual issues in the case. The court must decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed use of technology will serve a proper function. • Over-reliance: Technology—especially video technology—captures the imagination. The power and speed of modern communication and com - putation is impressive. Yet these attributes may also lead to over-reliance on technology in the courtroom. Traditional display boards or paper documents can often accomplish the same evidentiary purposes without the cost, difficulties, and risks of hi-tech devices. • Distortion of evidence: As this chapter has suggested, some technologies are capable of rearranging and enhancing images taken from reality. This creates two concerns: intentional misrepresentation of reality and, more commonly, the potential of confusion of recorded reality with computer - created information. When technology is used to present hypothetical scenarios or alter the appearance of recorded reality, the court must en - sure that the jurors are clearly informed about what they are to see and hear, and given the guidance and instruction needed to separate factual evidence from technological creations."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Part IV"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"411 40.

In multidistrict proceedings under 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the name given by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is used. 3. If many orders may be entered during the litigation, the court should number its major orders sequentially for convenient reference.

Transcripts of conferences at which rulings are made should be included in the numerical sequence if no separate order incorporating these rulings will be prepared. 4.

Subject to the Federal Rules of Evidence, stamped confidential documents and other confidential information may be offered in evi - dence at trial or any court hearing, provided that the proponent of the evidence gives five days’ advance notice to counsel for any party or other person that designated the information as confidential. Any party may move the court for an order that the evi - dence be received in camera or under other conditions to prevent unnecessary disclo - sure. The court will then determine whether the proffered evidence should continue to be treated as confidential information and, if so, what protection, if any, may be afforded to such information at the trial. 6. Subpoena by Other Courts or Agencies. If another court or an administrative agency subpoenas or orders production of stamped confidential documents that a party has obtained under the terms of this order, such party shall promptly notify the party or other person who designated the document as confidential of the pendency of such subpoena or order. 7. Filing. Stamped confidential documents need not be filed with the clerk except when required in connection with motions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 or 56 or other matters pending before the court. If filed, they shall be filed under seal and shall remain sealed while in the office of the clerk so long as they retain their status as stamped confidential documents. 8. Client Consultation. Nothing in this order shall prevent or otherwise restrict counsel from rendering advice to their clients and, in the course thereof, relying generally on examination of stamped confidential documents; provided, however, that in render - ing such advice and otherwise communicating with such clients, counsel shall not"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"456 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third make specific disclosure of any item so designated except pursuant to the procedures of paragraphs 2(b) and (c). 9. Prohibited Copying. If a document contains information so sensitive that it should not be copied by anyone, it shall bear the additional legend “Copying Prohibited.” Application for relief from this restriction against copying may be made to the court, with notice to counsel so designating the document. 10. Use. Persons obtaining access to stamped confidential documents under this order shall use the information only for preparation and trial of this litigation (including appeals and retrials), and shall not use such information for any other purpose, in - cluding business, governmental, commercial, administrative, or judicial proceedings.

All counsel of record shall make certification of compliance herewith and shall deliver the same to counsel for the party who produced the documents and not more than 150 days after final termination of this litigation. 12. Modification Permitted. Nothing in this order shall prevent any party or other per - son from seeking modification of this order or from objecting to discovery that it be - lieves to be otherwise improper. 13. Responsibility of Attorneys. The attorneys of record are responsible for employing reasonable measures, consistent with this order, to control duplication of, access to, and distribution of copies of stamped confidential documents. Parties shall not du - plicate any stamped confidential document except working copies and for filing in court under seal. 14. No Waiver. (a) Review of the confidential documents and information by counsel, experts, or consultants for the litigants in the litigation shall not waive the confidentiality of the documents or objections to production.

Such documents or parts thereof will be desig - nated after review by an attorney for the producing party by stamping the word “confidential” on each page. (b) If any party believes a document not described in the above paragraph should nevertheless be considered confidential, it may make application to the Court or Special Master. Such application shall only be granted for reasons shown and for extraordinary grounds. (c) Documents designated “confidential” shall be shown only to the attorneys, the parties, parties’ experts, actual or proposed witnesses, and other persons whom the attorneys deem necessary to review the documents for the prosecution or defense of this lawsuit. Each person who is permitted to see confidential docu - ments shall first be shown a copy of this Order and shall further be advised of the obligation to honor the confidentiality designation. (d) If a party believes that a document designated or sought to be designated confidential by the producing party does not warrant such designation, it shall first make a good faith effort to resolve such dispute with opposing counsel. In the event that such a dispute cannot be resolved by the parties, either party may apply to the Court or Special Master for a determination as to whether the desig - nation is appropriate. The burden rests on the party seeking confidentiality to demonstrate that such designation is proper. (e) At the time of deposition or within 10 days after receipt of the deposition tran - script, a party may designate as confidential specific portions of the transcript which contain confidential matters under the standards set forth in paragraph (a) above. This designation shall be in writing and served upon all counsel. No objection shall be interposed at deposition that an answer would elicit confidential information. Transcripts will be treated as confidential for this 10 - day period. Any portions of a transcript designated confidential shall thereafter be treated as confidential in accordance with this Order.

Absent extraordinary circumstances, counsel shall consult in advance with opposing counsel and unrepresented proposed deponents in an effort to sched - ule depositions at mutually convenient times and places. [That some counsel may be unavailable shall not, however, in view of the number of attorneys involved in this litigation, be grounds for deferring or postponing a deposition if another attorney from the same firm or who represents a party with similar interests is able to attend.] 4. Attendance. (a) Who May Be Present. Unless otherwise ordered under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c), de - positions may be attended by counsel of record, members and employees of their firms, attorneys specially engaged by a party for purposes of the deposition, the parties or the representative of a party, counsel for the deponent, and potential witnesses.

(c) Private Consultation. Private conferences between deponents and their attorneys in the course of interrogation are improper except for the purpose of determin - ing whether a privilege should be asserted. Unless prohibited by the court for good cause shown, such conferences may be held during normal recesses and adjournments. (d) Continuation of Deposition.

Filing of Order. A copy of this Order shall be filed in each such case. In cases subse - quently filed, a copy will be provided by the clerk to each plaintiff at the time of the filing the complaint and will be served with the complaint on any defendant not pre - viously a party in these cases. [In cases subsequently removed or transferred to this court, a copy will be provided by the clerk to each new party upon removal or trans - fer.] 2. Pretrial Consolidation. All cases in this litigation are consolidated for pretrial pur - poses. This is not a determination that any of these actions should be consolidated for trial. 3. Case Grouping Information. The cases in this litigation are further consolidated into subgroups for pretrial purposes. Those groups are [describe precisely the subgroups, such as all cases filed by attorney X, Y, and Z; all cases involving injuries or diseases X, Y, and Z; all cases involving exposure to products X, Y, and Z; all cases involving in - juries that occurred at worksites X, Y, and Z; all cases involving injuries that occurred in the same state; all cases involving the same set of defendants; all cases involving death, disabling injury, or nondisabling injury; or some combination of characteris - tics].

Plaintiffs’ and defendants’ counsel should attempt to come to an agreement on a method for entering such in - formation into a standard electronic format that would be available to the parties to the litigation and the court. [The court will entertain nominations of individuals to serve as a special master or court-appointed expert to assist the parties in establishing a database addressing the factors described above.] [If counsel are unable to agree on the factors or the format, the court will entertain nominations of individuals to serve as a special master or court-appointed expert to establish a database addressing the factors described above.] 5. Filing of Papers with Court. The purpose of the following instructions is to reduce the time and expense of duplicate filings of documents through use of a master case file, while at the same time not congesting the master case with miscellaneous plead - ings and orders that are of interest only to the parties directly affected by them. It is not intended that a party lose any rights based on a failure to follow these instruc - tions. (a) Master Docket and File. The clerk will maintain a master docket and case file under the style “In re  Product Liability Litigation (MDL-XXXX)” as master file number [CV NN-1000-X]. Orders, pleadings, motions, and other documents bearing a caption similar to that of this order will, when docketed and filed in the master case, be deemed to have been docketed and filed in each individual case to the extent applicable and will not ordinarily be separately docketed or physically filed in such individual cases. However, the caption may also contain a notation indicating whether the document relates to all cases or only to specified cases. (b) Separate Filing. A document that relates only to a specific case and would not be of interest except to the parties directly affected by it—such as an amended complaint adding a party or a motion to dismiss a party—should bear the cap - tion and case number of that case rather than of the master case file. Such a doc - ument will be docketed and filed in that case and not in the master case file. Please note that cases removed or transferred to this court are assigned a new case number in this court. (c) Leave to Add Parties. Until otherwise directed, plaintiffs are granted leave, with - out need for any special motion or order, to add other plaintiffs to any pending (or subsequently filed, removed, or transferred) case if all plaintiffs in the case (1) will be represented by the same counsel (or if counsel for existing plaintiffs consent to the intervention), (2) all plaintiffs are suing the same defendants, and (3) all plaintiffs [were exposed to defendants’ products] in the same state. The purpose of this authorization is to avoid unnecessary filing fees and the delays"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"504 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third inherent in 28 U.S.C. § 1407 transfers. The joinder of such parties will not be viewed as affecting subsequent motions by either plaintiffs or defendants for sep - arate trials under Rule 42(b). 6. Master Pleadings; Motions; Orders. (a) Master/Sample Complaints. Plaintiffs’ steering committee has filed in [CV NN- 10000-X]: (1) a master complaint containing allegations that would be suitable for adop - tion by reference in individual cases, and (2) a sample complaint illustrating how allegations from the master complaint can be incorporated into an individual case. The allegations of the master complaint are not deemed automatically included in any particular case. However, in order to avoid possible problems with statutes of limitations or doctrines of repose, it shall be deemed (except to the extent a plaintiff thereafter files an amended complaint disavowing such claims and theories or limits its claims and theories to those contained in an amended complaint) that as of this date, for cases now pending in this court (or as of the date other cases are filed in, removed to, or transferred to this court) a motion is filed in each such case to amend the complaint to add any potentially applicable claims and theories from the master complaint not contained in the complaint actually filed in that case. (b) Master Answers. By   , each entity listed below will file in [CV NN-1000-X] a master answer that incorporates its defenses in law or fact to claims made against it in the various actions that are presently pending in this lit - igation, including any cross claims it makes against other defendants. The answer will not attempt to provide a cross-reference to particular paragraphs or counts of the various complaints. The answer will, however, in a “generic” manner admit or deny (including denials based on lack of information and belief) the al - legations typically included in claims or cross claims made against it as well as make such additional allegations as are appropriate to its defenses or cross claims. This may be done through allegations such as “It alleges that it is incor - porated in State A; that it has its principal place of business in State B; that dur - ing the period from (date) to (date) it manufactured, sold, and distributed prod - ucts intended to be used in  ; that these products were intended to be used only by trained, knowledgeable    and were accompanied by warnings and instructions that adequately explained such risks as were inherent and unavoidable in the products; that these products were not unreasonably dangerous, were suitable for the purposes for which they were intended, and were distributed with adequate and sufficient warnings; that it is without knowledge or information at this time sufficient to form a belief as to any averment that one of its products was used in the procedure on which the"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Sample Orders and Forms 505 plaintiff’s complaint is based; that to the extent the plaintiff makes a claim for X (or under statute Y) it is not liable because  ; etc.” (1) When so filed in [CV NN-1000-X], these answers constitute an answer in each constituent case now pending or when hereafter filed in, removed to, or transferred to this court except to the extent the defendant later files a separate answer in an individual case. (2) A defendant not listed below may also file a master answer in [CV NN-1000- X] by  [date]  , or within 45 days after the first case in which it is named as a defendant is filed in, removed to, or transferred to this court. (c) Refinement of Pleadings. It is anticipated that an amended, more specific com - plaint and answer may be required before a case is scheduled for trial or re - manded to a transferor court, but amendments of pleadings prior to that time should generally be avoided. (d) Motions; Orders. A motion, brief, or response that has potential effect on mul - tiple parties (e.g., documents submitted in connection with a motion for partial summary judgment asserting that punitive damages are not recoverable with respect to [the product’s use] in State A) will be deemed made in all similar cases on behalf of, and against, all parties similarly situated except to the extent such other parties timely disavow such a position. Additional motions, briefs, or re - sponses addressed to such issues should not be filed or submitted by other par - ties except to the extent needed because of inadequacy of the original papers, to present unique facts, or a difference in positions. Orders resolving such motions will likewise be deemed as made with respect to all parties similarly situated un - less the order indicates otherwise. 7. Service of Original Complaints; Amendments Adding Parties. (a) Acceptable Service. Exhibit is a list of the “National Defendants”—that is, those entities that have frequently been named as defendants in these cases filed throughout the United States—with the name and address of their national counsel and information provided by national counsel indicating the state(s) in which they are incorporated, in which they have their principal place of doing business, and in which they will or may contest personal jurisdiction. To elimi - nate disputes over service of process and reduce the expense of such service, these defendants [have agreed] [shall inform the court within days as to whether or not they agree] to accept service of process in these cases (without, however, waiving any objections to personal jurisdiction or venue) if a copy of the summons and complaint is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person or address shown in Exhibit . Defendants’ agreement [report to the court as noted above should indicate whether it] applies to any case involving"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"506 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third [product] claims filed in any federal district court or in any state court of general jurisdiction. (b) Extension of Time to Serve. Notwithstanding Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), plaintiffs shall have thirty days after the date of this order (or, if later, thirty days after the date a case is subsequently filed in, removed to, or transferred to this court) in which to effect service on defendants. (c) Leave to Add Parties. Until otherwise directed, plaintiffs are granted leave, with - out need for any special motion or order, to add other plaintiffs to any pending (or subsequently filed, removed, or transferred) case if all plaintiffs in the case (1) will be represented by the same counsel (or if counsel for existing plaintiffs consent to the intervention), (2) all plaintiffs are suing the same defendants, and (3) all plaintiffs were exposed to [the product] in the same state. The purpose of this authorization is to avoid unnecessary filing fees and the delays inherent in 28 U.S.C. § 1407 transfers. The joinder of such parties will not be viewed as affecting subsequent motions by either plaintiffs or defendants for separate trials un der Rule 42(b). 8. Motions. (a) Meet and Confer. To avoid unnecessary litigation concerning motions, including motions relating to discovery disputes, counsel are directed to meet and confer before filing a motion. In any motion filed, counsel for the moving party must certify that a good faith effort was made to resolve the dispute. (b) Motions Under Rule 11, Rule 12, and Rule 56. No motion shall be filed under Rule 11, 12, or 56 without leave of court. 9. Inactive [Product] [Incident] Docket. The purpose of this paragraph is to establish a procedure for separating cases in which the plaintiff has little or no physical impair - ment from cases with more serious impairments to assist the court in establishing priorities for managing its docket. The intent is to toll the operation of any applicable statutes of limitation or repose while a case is listed as inactive. The clerk shall estab - lish a separate file called the “Inactive [product] [incident] Docket,” which shall consist of (1) cases voluntarily dismissed pursuant to a general stipulation prepared by plaintiffs and defendants that will set forth their agreement that such cases can be revived if specific conditions should be met, and (2) claims initiated by a “Notice of Claim” procedure. To invoke the notice procedure, a claimant must file an “Affidavit of Notice of Claim” that includes (1) the name(s), address(es), and marital status of the claimant(s); (2) a brief statement of circumstances of claimant’s exposure(s) to the [product] [incident giving rise to the common claims]; (3) a statement of the nature of the injury, disease, or condition alleged to have been caused by the [product] [incident]; and (4) the names of the entities to be given notice and whom the claimant proposes to serve."},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Sample Orders and Forms 507 Upon certification of the claimant(s) that notices have been sent to all listed de - fendants in the manner set forth in the stipulation of agreement signed by plaintiffs’ and defendants’ representatives, the claims shall be recorded on the inactive docket. The filing of the Notice of Claim or the voluntary dismissal pursuant to the stipu - lation shall toll all applicable statutes of limitation or repose regarding any claims of the plaintiff or plaintiff’s spouse, children, dependents, heirs, or estates arising relat - ing to the exposure to [product] [incident]. Claims may be removed from the inac - tive docket at any time by the filing and serving of a complaint. Signing the stipula - tion referred to above signifies the consent of each signing party to this procedure and to the tolling of the statutes of limitations or repose as described above. 10. Settlement. [Insert any special provisions to facilitate settlement, such as appointment of a set - tlement judge or special master to assist the parties, a timetable for scheduling settle - ment conferences, or procedures for using arbitration, minitrials, or summary jury trials. Also include any provision for contributions by later-settling parties to com - pensate designated counsel for services previously rendered.] [ 11. Discovery. See separate discovery order.] Dated:        United States District Judge Note: 1. See supra § 33.2"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"508 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third 41.53 CERCLA Case-Management Order [caption] Order No.  (Case-Management Order) It is ORDERED: 1. Limited Consolidation. Until further order of the Court, the above-captioned ac - tions, Civil Action No. and Civil Action No. (collectively, the “Actions”), are consolidated before the undersigned for the limited purposes of coordinated case management and discovery. 2. Lodging of the Administrative Record; Stay of Administrative Record Discovery. On or before [date] , plaintiff, the United States of America, will lodge with the Court the administrative record developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in connection with the initial Remedial Investigations and Feasibility Studies (RI/FS) for the    Landfill (the “Landfill”); on or before [date] ,     plaintiff, the United States of America, will lodge with the Court the administrative record developed by the EPA in connection with the Record of Decision (including the Supplemental Feasibility Study). No discovery shall be permitted at this time as to what documents constitute or will constitute these administrative records until further Order of the Court. 3. Temporary Stay of Counterclaims, Cross Claims, and Third-Party Claims. Until  [date]  , the date established herein for the Second Case-Management Conference, no counterclaims, cross claims, or third-party claims in either of the Actions, and no claims related to the Landfill by defendants in one of the Actions against defendants in the other of the Actions, shall be filed. The stay as to counter - claims and third-party claims shall be addressed at the Second Case-Management Conference. All counterclaims, cross claims, or third-party claims filed prior to the entry of this Order are stayed until the Second Case-Management Conference. 4. Filing of Claims. At the Second Case-Management Conference, scheduled herein, the Court will establish a schedule for filing of the claims referred to in the proceeding paragraph. Nothing in this Order shall prejudice the right of any defendant in either of the Actions to assert any such claims, nor shall any such claims be barred by laches or by any statute of limitations by virtue of the delay in filing such claims required by this order. 5. Realignment of Pleadings. The United States of America, in Civil No. , and the State Department of Environmental Protection, in Civil No. , are hereby granted"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Sample Orders and Forms 509 leave to file amended complaints, not later than  [date]  , without the necessity of a motion. The purposes of these amended complaints are to cure misnomer problems, to add defendants, to dismiss defendants already named, without prejudice, to conform the defendants named in the two amended complaints to the degree that the plaintiffs deem appropriate, and to clarify the causes of action, demands, and relief sought in the amended complaints to the degree that the plaintiffs deem appropriate. Existing defendants who have already answered or otherwise re sponded to the complaint need not answer or otherwise respond to the amended complaint unless they choose to do so. All other defendants shall answer or otherwise respond within the time provided in the Rules. 6. Joinder of New Parties. Except as provided herein or by subsequent order, no party may join an additional party in this case. The joinder of new parties may occur through the amendment of the complaints (see  above), or by the coordi - nated efforts of the Defense Litigation Committee to be formalized by the defendants. The Defense Litigation Committee will serve as a clearinghouse for information per - tinent to identifying new parties through coordinated discovery efforts. Discovery with respect to joining new parties is discussed in paragraphs   below. No later than [date] , the Defense Litigation Committee shall have assembled a list of new parties whose joinder will be considered at the Second Case- Management Conference on  [date]  . To the extent feasible, this listing shall be selective, seeking joinder of parties with a relatively higher degree of alleged responsibility and continuing viability, and avoid - ing joinder of parties with a relatively lower degree of alleged responsibility or which are of doubtful viability. It is anticipated that leave to file a consolidated third-party complaint joining the new parties in an orderly fashion, and leave for individual de - fendants to file contractual indemnification claims, will be granted at the Second Case-Management Conference. [There will be an additional opportunity to join fur - ther new parties in the future as the cases unfold.] 7. Amendments. The goal of the Amended Complaints and the Consolidated third - party complaint is to have a more unified and orderly set of pleadings and joinders so that these Actions may go forward expeditiously. 8. Scope of Discovery. Discovery shall be limited at present to the following issues: (a) Identification of new parties. (b) Quantity, quality, and nexus of parties’ wastes to the  Landfill. [It is anticipated that parties providing full discovery on these issues and believing themselves to have no nexus of hazardous wastes to the Landfill will be permitted to seek summary judgment in the near future.] No discovery is permitted at this time regarding issues of “release or threatened re - lease” at the Landfill, or of “the incurring of response costs consistent with the NCP"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"510 Manual for Complex Litigation, Third at the Landfill.” Enlarging discovery to these issues, and the precise extent, timing, and appropriateness of summary judgment motion practice relating to some or all li - ability issues, will be considered at the Second Case-Management Conference, follow - ing lodging of the Administrative Records under    , above. Forms of Discovery 9. Document Production. Production of documents shall be coordinated and go for - ward promptly and responses shall be served within  days of service. The deposition of representatives of EPA, DEP [the State Department of Environmental Protection], or a defendant shall not go forward until that party has responded to the document production request upon it. 10. Depositions. Depositions are permitted at this time only with respect to the issue of identification of new parties and quantity, quality, and nexus. Such depositions may be taken, on these issues, of existing parties and nonparties, except that no deposi - tions of representatives of the EPA or the DEP or of a defendant are permitted until that party has timely responded to the document production request upon it. Scheduling of depositions on behalf of defendants will be coordinated between the plaintiffs and the Defense Litigation Committee, endeavoring to conduct not more than one deposition at a time. 11. Procedure for Scheduling Depositions. *** 12. Interrogatories to Plaintiffs. The plaintiffs shall serve certified responses to a com - mon set of interrogatories, derived from the set of interrogatories served by    on behalf of fourteen defendants, pertaining to quantity, quality, nexus, and identification of additional parties, within  days after service, to the same extent as if served on behalf of all  defendants in the United States case and all  defendants in the State case.

The plaintiffs may propound a set of common inter - rogatories on the above issues upon each of the defendants, each of whom shall serve certified responses to same within days after service. 14. Requests for Admission. Requests for admission shall not be served until further or - der of the court, to be discussed at the Second Case-Management Conference. 15. Liaison Counsel for Defendants. The court recognizes the defendants’ selection of    ,   , as Liaison Counsel for Defendants with respect to communications from the court to the defendants. 16. Service List.

Directions. (a) Narration of Proposed Facts. In stating facts proposed to be proved, counsel shall do so in brief, simple, declarative, self-contained, consecutively numbered sentences, avoiding all “color words,” labels, argumentative language, and legal conclusions. If a fact is to be offered against fewer than all parties, counsel shall indicate the parties against which the fact will (or will not) be offered. [The facts to be set forth include not only ultimate facts, but also all subsidiary and supporting facts except those offered solely for impeachment purposes.] (b) Agreement and Disagreement. Counsel shall indicate that they do not contest a proposed fact if at trial they will not controvert or dispute that fact. In indicating disagreement with a proposed fact, counsel shall do so by deletion or interlin - eation of particular words or phrases so that the nature of their disagreement (and the extent of any agreement) will be clear. (c) Objections. Objections to the admissibility of a proposed fact (either as irrelevant or on other grounds) may not be used to avoid indicating whether or not the party contests the truth of that fact.

Facts, not evidence, are to be listed by the parties. However, a party may identify in parentheses at the end of a proposed fact the witness(es), deponent(s), document(s), or other evidence supporting the truth of the fact. No party, however, will be required to admit or deny the accuracy of such references.

In their re - sponse, parties shall, if they object to any such proposed fact or proposed proof, state precisely the grounds of their objection and, if they will contest the accuracy of the proposed fact, similarly list the witnesses, documents, depositions, interrogatories, or admissions that they will offer to controvert that fact.
