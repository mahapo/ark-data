The final and highest degree of the original Illuminati system devised by Adam Weishaupt, the founder of theoriginal Illuminati Order has the working title “Rex,” and in this book, I will finally expose the trueMasonic/Illuminati/Jesuit roots of the Satanic Davos Agenda headed by German Professor Klaus Schwab.According to the founder of the Temple of Set and Fourth Reich proponent Michael Aquino, Satan revealed to himhis true name to be Set, which was the name used by his followers in ancient Egypt.[2] After all, it seems ratherplausible that “Satan,” a word of Hebrew origin, comes from Set, the name of the Egyptian god who came to beassociated with evil in Egyptian mythology.This is the first book ever written on the occult roots of the infamous Great Reset, with a unique analysis ofpast and current events, where I debunk in the process, the lies of the mainstream media, as well as the incorrectviews brought forward by the Anti Defamation League (ADL), who wrote two years ago that, “Since first emergingin the spring of 2020, ‘The Great Reset’ conspiracy has gained traction with the ongoing spread of COVID-19 inboth mainstream and fringe circles alike.” Promptly indicating that we, “can find antisemitic sentiments in the GreatReset, with some believers going so far as to accuse Jews of orchestrating the plot or invoking George Soros and theRothschild family.” Now, to avoid any further misunderstanding with the Jewish Community, who I respect andlove, as I am also Jewish, I find this assertion by the Jewish ADL not only completely wrong but even dangerous inthe long run, for both Jews and Christians alike. In this book, I will reveal how the present rise of the Fourth Reich,hiding under the disguise of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” is just as dangerous as the Third Reich was, and thedangers that we might face in the coming years when the persecution of real Christians and real Jewish believerswill only increase in the age of the Antichrist and Cyber Satan. I will not only expose the final stage of thisdiabolical trap created by the Jesuit-Sabbatean-Frankist New World Order but also show you how to survive it, withthe unique proposal of the Great Reject. Because this is not only a revelatory essay, and probably my best work, butalso a manual to survive the unfolding Apocalypse, you should invite as many like-minded people as you can topurchase and read it."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEResettling the Herd for the Great Reset  The Rise of The Fourth Reich After defining the Satanic nature of the term Great Reset, let’s pick up from where I left off in Vol. 6.66, withthe official statement made by Vatican News on the 2-day conference that the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy ofSocial Sciences (PASS), and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (PAS), jointly organized on “robotics andartificial intelligence” in May 2019, as I was on my way to my new life in the United States of America.Pope Francis has also shown interest in the issue. In a message to the World Economic Forum in Davos inJanuary 2018, he urged that AI, robotics, and other technological innovations be used to help contribute to the“service of humanity and the protection of our common home”.[3]​ Now, after all the talk about the impending Great Reset since the start of the COVID pandemic, the words ofPope Francis assume a rather different and even more sinister meaning. The Sanitary (or medical) dictatorship isredrawing the boundaries of our world (and our freedoms), and altering the playing field faster than we can keep up,and thanks to the technological advances of AI and robotics, a very dim looking future seems upon us. Owed inlarge part to the U.S. government’s deep-seated and, in many cases, top-secret alliances with foreign nations, globalcorporations, and think thanks, as the World Economic Forum mentioned above, it’s become increasingly obviousthat we have entered into a New World Order—a Global World Order—made up of international governmentagencies and corporations,[4] working more and more under the influence of the Jesuits and the Catholic Church.The Great Reset is upon us, and the powers that be and the Vatican, who are at the top of the pyramid of the NewWorld Order, are ready for 2030, with one of the main figures to usher in this new era, the infamous Klaus Schwab,the perpetually scowling figure who heads the World Economic Forum, a man who looks like the character, Dr.Ernst Stavro Blohfeld, the head of SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, andExtortion), the fictional villain from the James Bond series of novels and films, created by Ian Fleming, who by theway had also direct involvement with one of England’s most notorious occultists and Illuminati, Aleister Crowley.I’m not the only one who has noticed the resemblance between Schwab and the fictional villain, because pictures ofSchwab in a gray uniform, holding a white cat, like SPECTRE’s Blohfeld, have been circulating on the internet forsome time now. Of course, Schwab, was too young at the time to be inspired by Fleming, and it is generally thoughtthat the character of Blohfeld was based on real-life Greek arms dealer Basil Zaharoff (1849-1936), known also asCount Zacharoff, Prince Zacharias Basileus Zacharoff, and to his intimates as “Zedzed.” One of the richest men inthe world during his lifetime, Zaharoff was described as both a “merchant of death” and a “mystery man of Europe,”a bit like Klaus Schwab is today for many, and in 2012 the influential Smithsonian Magazine defined Zaharoff as“The Wickedest Man in the World.”[5] Interestingly enough, this is a title also given by the English tabloids toAleister Crowley. The Smithsonian Magazine also describes “Zedzed” as the kind of man Crowley would haveprobably loved to know, and probably did, as they had numerous friends in common.Zacharias Basileus Zacharoff, better known as Sir Basil Zaharoff: arsonist, bigamist, pimp, arms dealer,honorary knight of the British Empire, a confidant of kings, and all-round international man of mystery.[6]​ Who knows if in one hundred years the Smithsonian Magazine, will define similarly Professor Schwab, butlet’s go back to the term “New World Order” once considered only a fringe “conspiracy theory”, that is now on fulldisplay, plain as day for everyone to see and witness, fueled by evil figures like Klaus Schwab, who like I justpointed out, look more like a fictional villain from the Bond series, than somebody who wants to save the planet. Atthe moment the economic, political, academic, and media elites around the world are leveraging the chaos,confusion, and restrictions on liberty from the COVID-19 lockdowns, using them to radically alter society aroundthe world.[7] ​ All this is done in preparation for the Great Reset that is not a baseless conspiracy theory that doesn’t exist,like most of the mainstream media would like you to think, but rather the final unveiling of the reality of the NewWorld Order. Global elites see the COVID pandemic and climate alarm as a two-headed Trojan Horse that can be"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"used to foist in SDRs, aka Special Drawing Rights on the global population, that has suddenly become accustomedto following government orders, and push towards the establishment of a cashless society where cash is replaced byits digital equivalent. Deutsche Bank’s Chief Executive, John Cryan, predicted at Davos in 2016 that cash probablywouldn’t exist in ten years.[8] ​ The COP26 meeting of elite climate alarmists and heads of state, held in Glasgow between the 31st of Octoberto the 12th of November 2021, highlighted the use of central bankers and financial regulation to push the alarmistagenda, by cutting off lending and underwriting services to energy companies that don’t promote renewables, thatpursue oil and gas exploration. The trend towards a single world currency is real also in the Great Reset.[9] The useof non-cash transactions and settlement in daily life began during the 1990s when electronic banking becamecommon. By the 2010s digital payment methods were widespread in many countries, with intermediaries such asPayPal, digital wallet systems such as Apple Pay, contactless and NFC payments by electronic card or smartphone,and electronic bills and banking, all in widespread use. But there is a dark sense of what is coming next, as all myPayPal accounts, for example, as well as those of many patriots, were closed in the past couple of years, simply forhaving expressed opinions contrary to the mainstream on a variety of subjects. This means, that we will no longer beable to survive in a future cashless society if we oppose their tyranny and openly speak our minds.​ We can call this growing sense of oppression the result of a Global Deep State, a powerful international cabalworking under the directives of the Jesuits, and financed by the Sabbatean Frankists, that does not care about us andis just as real as the corporatized, militarized, industrialized American Deep State that serves it, and it poses just asgreat a threat to our rights as individuals, if not greater. We’ve been inching closer to this Global World Order forthe past several decades, but with COVID-19, governmental and corporate interests have become intertwined,shifting this transformation into high gear.[10] In this scenario, the American Deep State (“a national-securityapparatus that holds sway even over the elected leaders in charge of it”), answers to the Global Deep State, an entitycontrolled ultimately by the infamous Jesuits and the Vatican. So what will this change look like? Well, the globalelites want to create a society of renters who own nothing, while also pushing a social agenda that would beunpopular with the unwashed masses and difficult to implement in a society with a broad, ownership-based middleclass. What this means is that you would rent not just your home, but in the future also your phone, computer, car(though you probably will “carshare,” the term for renting a car when you need one for an extended period andsummoning one when you need it for a ride), but this modality might even go as far as the pots and pans you cookwith.[11] A radical transformation of the world economy into a Communist economy. No longer will you have a jobin the sense that it has traditionally been understood. Instead, you will work various “gigs,” all of which place you ina precarious position at any given time. You will receive a fee for services performed, with no benefits, paid timeoff, healthcare, or anything else that the middle class in the West have become accustomed to.[12] Now we should allconsider the extent to which our lives and liberties will be impacted by this international convergence ofgovernmental and profit-driven corporate interests in the surveillance state, the military–industrial complex, theprivate prison industry, the intelligence sector, the security sector, the technology sector, the telecommunicationssector, the transportation sector, the pharmaceutical industry and, most recently, by the pharmaceutical-health sector.All of these sectors are dominated by mega-corporations operating on a global scale and working throughgovernment channels to increase their profit margins. The profit-driven policies of these global corporate giantsinfluence everything from legislative policies to economics to environmental issues to medical care.[13]​ To facilitate the Great Reset, rural populations will be coerced into more concentrated population centerssince dispersed populations have a higher ”carbon footprint” as has been pointed out by the research report in thejournal Environmental Research Communications.[14] The suburbs will be a thing of the past as suburbs and exurbsbecome more like cities. Mixed-use housing, where you and 500 other people live in a mid-rise condo hive, withshops and \"workshare\" spaces (the new version of an office – on your dime, not your employer's) in the same area.[15] The short version is that it's a total end to the American way of life, specifically the way of life of most of theWestern middle class.[16]This “Great Reset” that is being framed as stakeholder capitalism, like the newer, kinderversion of capitalism, will essentially mean conditioning people to “live” within smaller physical footprints, andvirtualized spaces, in digital environments. We are being pushed into the virtual world, that is where the neweconomic model of post-capitalist growth is going to happen for the New World Order, and the technicalinfrastructure has already been set up to create both Augmented Reality physical world spaces, the spatial web, anda parallel world that is linked to the exterior world, that can be either the virtualized world of gaming and theMetaverse developed by Epic Games, Inc. (Known as “Epic”) CEO Tim Sweeney, and other executives. That isdescribed as “an expansive, digitized communal space where users can mingle freely with brands and one another inways that permit self-expression and spark joy.”[17] Or what Sweeney said will be a more “manicured, ad-ladennews feed” version set up by Facebook’s Zuckerberg, who said last year that he hopes that users stop thinking of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Facebook as a social media company and more of a Metaverse company. For Tim Sweeney however, the Metaversereality will be different and freer, a bit like the early internet I guess:It would be a kind of online playground where users could join friends to play a multiplayer game like Epic’s“Fortnite” one moment, watch a movie via Netflix the next, and then bring friends to test drive a new car that’scrafted the same in the real world as it would be in this virtual one.[18]​ So, what is the Metaverse? Well on Wikipedia, it is described in the following way:A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. In futurism and science fiction,the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that isfacilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets. The term \"metaverse\" has its origins in the1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of \"meta\" and \"universe.\" Various metaverses havebeen developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life. Some metaverse iterationsinvolve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies, often including a significantinterest in advancing virtual reality technology. The term has seen considerable use as a buzzword for publicrelations purposes to exaggerate development progress for various related technologies and projects.Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within metaverses, stemming from challenges facing thesocial media and video game industries as a whole.[19]​ The idea that you will live a large part of your lives in these games and virtual set ups, and that you will havean avatar representing you, is already pushing the guys at Epic in the Research Triangle Park, and their UnrealEngine to move further. They’ve just launched Meta Humans, which is software that allows people to create veryaccurate representations of humans in a digital space very rapidly, something that used to take a lot of time. So theycan virtualize you, and become you, and this is only the start of this dangerous trend. There’s been a lot ofdiscussion about “deep fakes,” and what they will also mean in the context of these future virtual worlds.   The spatial web hooked up to sensor networks, the so-called Internet of Things(IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB), which is already being developed in their first stages with 5G, will soon reachthe next stage with 6G. The rise of devices that connect the human body to the web is accelerating rapidly and that’stheir focus. With the 6G networks that are still being developed as I write, we are expected to have even moreheterogeneity, and will likely support applications beyond current mobile use scenarios that start to tackle the firsttranshumanist features with the Internet of Bodies (IoB), as well as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR),ubiquitous instant communications, pervasive intelligence, and the already cited Internet of Things (IoB). TheRAND Corporation global policy think tank is already ringing the alarm bell regarding the Internet of Bodies (IoB):This Internet of Bodies could revolutionize health care and improve our quality of life. But withoutappropriate guardrails, it could also jeopardize our most intimate personal information and introduce severalethical concerns.[20]Adding that:This type of technology, appropriately dubbed the Internet of Bodies (IoB), has the potential to improve ourlives in countless ways. But the risks are just as legion.[21]​ Remember there is much more which is being planned that will interface with both wearable technology andpotentially bio-sensor technology that is being developed as we speak. It’s all military research and development atthe moment, but that’s going to change soon.​ In a document that recently surfaced online, entitled 6G The Next Hyper-Connected Experience for All bySamsung, one of the leaders in today’s smartphone market, it says: “We expect that 6G will provide the ultimateexperience for all through hyper-connectivity involving humans and everything.”​ Adding that,It is envisaged that the number of connected devices will reach 500 billion by 2030, which is about 59 timeslarger than the expected world population (8.5 billion) by that time. Mobile devices will take various form-factors, such as augmented reality (AR) glasses, virtual reality (VR) headsets, and hologram devices.Increasingly, machines will need to be connected using wireless communications. Examples of connected"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"machines include vehicles, robots, drones, home appliances, displays, smart sensors installed in variousinfrastructures, construction machinery, and factory equipment.[22]​ The research in question comes originally out of military space. We will exist as characters in their mind.This is how they imagine it. Those in power, like Klaus Schwab, imagine that we will be virtualized, becomingalmost like characters in the game of our lives, and pushed into virtual spaces to consume digital items while theelite enjoys real life. Even when we are allowed to go out into the actual real world, we will be trackable andtraceable through wearable technologies, and this sort of global bio-security state, that is rolling out with thesedigital pass systems, unveiled even further by the pandemic, is only the start of the true prison planet unfoldingaround us. Recently, in January 2022 a Serbian Orthodox bishop called the world’s Christians to unite againstCOVID vaccine passports. In a homily, the Serbian Orthodox Bishop Photius of the Eparchy of Zvornik and Tuzladescribed a great battle “being fought for human freedom on all continents” and urged the faithful to join the causeagainst digital slavery.[23] Digital identity systems will track our real body as a character in real physical space, andvirtual space. There is a shift towards something called Globalization 4.0, which is the next phase of globalization,aka the Fourth Reich, where they are not only platforming screen-based labor but also with haptic robotics andcontrollers so that you could sit in your bedroom and control a factory halfway around the world. The competitionfor “work” will be mediated through your digital identity on blockchain systems. The sensor networks have to bebuilt, the coding has to be built, training the artificial intelligence is ongoing and the machine learning systems stillhave to be built, but I’m pretty sure they are already working on it. That’s why it is expected that with 6G, we willhave intelligent automated management underpinned by mobile edge computing, artificial intelligence, short-packetcommunication, and, of course, blockchain technologies. Another reason to abandon the crypto frenzy as it is a trapset up by the AI aka Cyber Satan.  Under the Obama Administration, there was a huge shift towards STEM education (Science,Technology, Engineering, and Math). This push has been very limited on literature and creative thinking unless itwas about robotics. A huge move towards STEM was made and implemented in the U.S., because those in powerknew from the start, that they need to build a spatial web to establish the Internet of Bodies (IoB), so they canfinalize their evil plan for this global prison planet, and to manifest this they also need children to become willingparticipants, starting under the guise of a fun game. You would code these games, and all this would later normalizethe world you live in made up of gaming environments. Even today in school classrooms, there is a push forbehavioral management systems that are gamified, where you are portrayed as a cartoon, and teachers give childrenpoints for good behavior, that they can in turn exchange for digital items. This is all about conditioning kids to livein a virtual economy, which is how the capitalist growth model intends to move in the future. It is going to goinward into this other dimension that is a virtual world.[24] The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled us into a wholenew global frontier. Those hoping to navigate this interconnected and highly technological world of contact tracing,vaccine passports, and digital passes, will find themselves grappling with issues that touch on deep-seated moral,political, religious, and personal questions for which there may be no clear-cut answers. We are about to find ourability to access, engage and move about in the world dependent on which camp we fall into: those who have beenvaccinated against COVID-19, and those who have not, who have now become the ”infamous” unvaccinated, likeme. “It is the latest status symbol. Flash it around, and you can get access to concerts, sports arenas, or long-forbidden restaurant tables. Some day, it may even help you cross a border without having to quarantine,” showingus a glimpse of this dim future scenario, wrote Heather Murphy for the New York Times.[25] “The new platinum cardof the Covid age is the vaccine certificate.” This is what M.I.T. professor Ramesh Raskar refers to as the new“currency for health,” an apt moniker given the potentially lucrative role that Big Business (Big Pharma and BigTech, especially) will play in establishing this pay-to-play marketplace. And the U.S. government has been all-too-happy to allow (at least for the moment), the corporate sector to take the lead, while in the ever so socialistic andOrwellian European Union, they have already imposed the most stringent vaccine mandates and passport rules incountries like Italy, France, Germany, and from Austria, we saw also the start of a dangerous new trend inNovember 2021, the lockdowns of the unvaccinated, that was soon embraced in the months to follow by many othercountries of the EU including Italy. In the meantime, shocking new footage emerged from China at the end of 2021,showing police parading rule-breakers through the streets carrying placards with their names and photoidentification, an act of “public shaming” condemned by the global community, that might still become a reality inmany other countries. If certain people have it their way, the unvaccinated will be unable to board an airplane andwill be banned from restaurants or bars for years to come. Some people even say the unvaccinated should lose theirhealth insurance for making an unpopular personal health decision. During the pandemic, governments across theworld set up reporting systems to rat out neighbors for having family over for the holidays. In the U.S., Vermont’s"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"governor even asked students to snitch on their parents who might have invited extended family duringThanksgiving 2020, and the following year was not much better, with a libtard President leading the charge— withthe help of the Big Tech companies who are providing new, easy ways to report your “radical” friends and family tothe government. But what constitutes radical for these slaves of the system? Basically, anything they don’t want youto do or believe.[26] This is the problem when only a handful of powerful centralized institutions, guided by theantichristian Company of Jesus, and their Sabbatean friends, are indeed controlling America. We have an increasedGlobal Surveillance spearheaded by the National Security Agency (NSA), which has shown itself to care little forconstitutional limits or privacy in the U.S. and abroad, the surveillance state has come to dominate our governmentand our lives, and even if you live outside the U.S, the situation will be no different. Yet the government does notoperate alone, it cannot. It requires an accomplice. Thus, the increasingly complex security needs of our massivefederal government, especially in the areas of defense, surveillance, and data management, have been met within thecorporate sector, which has shown itself to be a powerful ally that both depends on and feeds the growth ofgovernmental bureaucracy. Take AT&T, for instance. Through its vast telecommunications network thatcrisscrosses the globe, AT&T provides the U.S. government with the complex infrastructure it needs for its masssurveillance programs.​ According to The Intercept:The NSA considers AT&T to be one of its most trusted partners and has lauded the company’s ‘extremewillingness to help.’ It is a collaboration that dates back decades. Little known, however, is that its scope is notrestricted to AT&T’s customers. According to the NSA’s documents, it values AT&T not only because it ‘hasaccess to information that transits the nation,’ but also because it maintains unique relationships with otherphone and internet providers. The NSA exploits these relationships for surveillance purposes, commandeeringAT&T’s massive infrastructure and using it, as a platform to covertly tap into communications processed byother companies.[27]​ Now magnify what the U.S. government is doing through AT&T and the Silicon Valley mafia on a globalscale in support of the New World Order, and you have the “14 Eyes Program,” also referred to as the “SIGINTSeniors.” This global spy agency is made up of 14 members from around the world: The United States, The UnitedKingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Belgium, Italy,Sweden, and Spain. In addition to these confirmed alliances, it is also worth mentioning another handful of countriesthat have been caught or suspected of exchanging information with the “Fourteen Eyes Alliance,” and thosecountries are Israel, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, India, and all British Overseas Territories. In addition to thecore nations of the “14 Eyes Program,”, the existence of two other international intelligence-sharing agreementshas been confirmed. These two agreements, known as the “Five Eyes” and the “Nine Eyes” Alliances, might be ornot be as tight-knit as the “14 Eyes Program,” but they still have wide implications for internet privacy as suggestedby enhanced security and privacy, VPN companies.Here is a brief breakdown of each of the three Alliances:Five Eyes: US, UK, Canada, Australia, New ZealandNine Eyes: Five Eyes + Denmark, France, Holland, NorwayFourteen Eyes: Nine Eyes + Germany, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Spain​ The Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes Alliances are essentially extensions of the original Five Eyes Alliance.While these countries may not all share as much information with each other as the Five Eyes Alliance, they stillactively and willingly participate in international intelligence-sharing.[28] Surveillance is just the tip of the icebergwhen it comes to these global alliances working for the Great Reset. Then, as usual, war remains a huge money-making venture, and America, with its vast military empire and its ever so incestuous relationship with a host ofinternational defense contractors, has been until now one of its biggest buyers and sellers of such business, thanks,of course, to all those swamp creatures in Washington DC. In this context, the American military-industrial complexhas erected an empire unsurpassed in history, but things are changing on the horizon, and not looking good forUncle Sam, as the powerful members of the Jesuit/ Illuminati elite, are preparing to switch to the New ChineseWorld Order with the help of Russia.​ During the Christmas festivities of the year 2021 Russian State TV, said the U.S. will be “reduced toradioactive ash” if they don’t meet Russia’s demands regarding, Ukraine[29], and a couple of days earlier China’sforeign minister said they would not fear a confrontation with the U.S.[30] This while they are busy threatening"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Taiwan with an invasion. In the meantime, the U.S. Airforce appears to be more interested in the sexuality of theindividuals in its ranks led by the LGBTQ Initiatives Team (LIT)[31] than in China and Russia, who are makingthreats towards this nation I now call home. No wonder Elon Musk, in his now epic 54-minute interview withBabylon Bee, savaged leftist puppet Sen. Liz Warren and described woke culture as a “mind virus,” and “arguablyone of the biggest threats to modern civilization.”[32] But the U.S. military doesn’t seem to care. The U.S. Army, forexample, has followed the CIA's suit made a few weeks earlier in May 2021[33], with a new “woke” recruitment ad,that features an animated lesbian wedding and an LGBTQ parade[34]because those are the nonsense problems of ourtime for the military of today, and all this while erecting an unprecedented security surveillance state in the U.S., tocontrol all Americans. The military–industrial complex (MIC) keeps perpetuating a worldwide military empire withAmerican troops stationed in 176 countries (over 70% of the countries worldwide), which is shown to be completelyuseless in case of a direct attack on U.S. soil. I am a big supporter of the military and believe that this farse needs toend, as people are finally realizing the fraud that is being inflicted upon them by the ruling elite, and as my friend,publisher of several of my books, and author, Brad Olsen, points out in his final book in the Esoteric Series BeyondEsoteric: Escaping Prison Planet, we all need to change the way we think,Earth may have been “run” in a manner analogous to a prison planet in the ancient past, where religionsand monumental construction projects were engineered under near-slavery conditions. It appears that this wasattempted possibly for the purpose of inhibiting the natural and healthy development of civilization, as well assuppressing or distorting collective memory. While these efforts appear to have been interrupted, it is possiblethat residual disruptive influences remain in the “zoo.” But now the caged animals are waking up. Humanity istruly a collective intelligence. This collective intelligence changes only when the thoughts of many peopleevolve. By thinking differently, people create a change in their reality. It is impossible for the thoughts of asingle individual to do this alone, whether that person is the president of a nation, a saint, or a commoner. It isuseless to petition the elites to change society, for these people became elites in the first place by reflecting theconsciousness of the society that shaped them. However, when the masses within a society change, then do theelites change. Thus, there is no escape from the fact that if one wants a better world, one has to work with themasses within a society, since the masses themselves literally have to think their way into that better world.There are no exceptions to this.[35]​ However, I’m afraid our society is moving within the next decade towards a point of no return. So, it isimpossible to even try to push everyone towards a significant change for a “better world,” because sadly mostpeople today comply more and more with the Great Reset. Of course, there are still those like-minded individualsthat can join our Great Reject.​ Recently philosopher José Quarracino an influential Catholic writer exposed Pope Francis as a cunningclimber of the Church's power structure who nonetheless serves as a “buffoon of a plutocratic group” claiming aneed to rehabilitate capitalism for the global good. The oligarchs in Francis’ good graces feel guilty because they“know they have become hyper-billionaires while 90% of the world's population has received some crumbs,” saidphilosopher José Quarracino, slamming the pontiff for cozying up to the world's elites by creating the Council forInclusive Capitalism with the Vatican.[36] This organization that descends from the previous Coalition forInclusive Capitalism, is directly connected to both the Academy of the Illuminati in Rome and the Rothschildfamily, and they have “explicitly elected Pope Francis as their moral guide.”[37] This new international foundationbrings together about seventy elite members of the Vatican-led New World Order, and is fueled with powerfulmanagers, influential bankers, and consultants of the highest level from all over the world, divided between“Advisors” and “Members” who call themselves “Stewards” and “Allies.” This new “mysterious foundation” wascreated with the direct involvement of the Illuminati Academy in Rome in December 2020, on the personal initiativeof Lynn Forester De Rothschild herself, wife of Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild, president of NM Rothschild &Sons, financial advisor to the Queen of England, and former governor of the prestigious London School ofEconomics, as well as the owner of The Economist. Back on April 11, 2013, Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild andSir Evelyn de Rothschild who is very popular in China, that seems obsessed with the Rothschild family legacy,participated in a dialogue on Inclusive Capitalism, held on CKGSB’s Beijing campus. Sir Evelyn Robert deRothschild who has always been a close friend of Jesuit Illuminati agents, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and his wife,Lynn Forester De Rothschild, have always been close to the Democratic Party, she is, in fact, a registered member ofthe U.S. Democratic Party. On top of that, Lynn Forester De Rothschild was until July 2020, the CEO of the familyoffice E.L.

In my eyesat least, Lynn Forester De Rothschild seems the typical follower of the Green leftist ideal, which refers primarily toa political affiliation that combines elements of Environmentalism, Feminism, Socialism, and Pacifism, for the joyof the Company of Jesus. That’s why at the center of this “Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism with the Vatican,”there is Piergiorgio Bassi, Vice President of the Academy of the Illuminati, of which the former Grand Master ofItalian Freemasonry, Giuliano Di Bernardo, is President. Bassi, who I know personally from my time in theIlluminati, is an entrepreneur with high-level relationships in the Vatican, that I have already talked extensivelyabout, in Volumes 2 and 4 of my Confessions.[38] [39] FIG. 1 – Donald Pleasence (1919-1995) was the first actor to play SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld on camera in the James Bond series outfittedwith a creepy facial scar.

The illicit merger of the global"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"armaments industry and the Pentagon that President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us against more than 50 yearsago has come to represent perhaps the greatest threat to the nation’s fragile infrastructure today.​ America’s expanding military empire is bleeding the country dry at a rate of over $15 billion a month (or $20million an hour), and that’s just what the government spends on foreign wars. That does not include the cost ofmaintaining and staffing the 1000-plus U.S. military bases spread around the globe. Incredibly, although the U.S.constitutes only 5% of the world’s population, America boasts almost 50% of the world’s total military expenditure,spending more on the military than the next 19 biggest spending nations combined. The Pentagon spends more onwar than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. There’s a good reason why“bloated,” “corrupt” and “inefficient” are among the words most commonly applied today about the government,especially the Department of Defense and its contractors. Price gouging has become an accepted form of corruptionwithin the American military empire. It’s not just the American economy that is being gouged, unfortunately.​ Driven by a greedy defense sector in bed with the Illuminati and elite Freemasonry, the American homelandhas been transformed into a battlefield with militarized police and weapons better suited to a war zone. PresidentBiden, marching in lockstep with his predecessors (aside from our unusual 45th President Donald J. Trump duringhis first and possibly last mandate), have continued to expand America’s military empire abroad and domestically ina clear bid to pander to the powerful money interests (military, corporate, and security) controlled by the Sabbatean-Frankist/Jesuit Deep State, that holds the present government in its clutches, and might have compromised formerPresident Trump who flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private Lolita Express jet more times than was previously known, aslight logs revealed after new documents were released during Ghislaine Maxwell trial that ended with a guiltyverdict.[40] As well all know, Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused underage girls and joined the late Sabbatean-Frankist/ Illuminati Kingpin Jeffrey Epstein in directing, amongst others, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, to be sexuallyabused by Epstein’s powerful friends like Prince Andrew, who was recently stripped of all his royal titles for thisreason.[41]Giuffre is quoted saying Maxwell, “trained me as a sex slave.”[42] After all, “Do what you want, and youwill be saved,” is the message of the Jewish heresy called Frankism, which sounds very much like AleisterCrowley’s “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” that Ghislaine Maxwell, the now-defunct boyfriendJeffrey Epstein, and even her late father, Robert Maxwell, seemed to have followed. The Maxwell’s and Epsteinwere all part of this secretive Jewish cult that originated in the 18th century and recruits influential followersamongst the Jewish elite until the present day. The nihilist religion of Frankism preaches “redemption throughsin.” The doctrine of “the sacred sin,” demands to annihilate moral religion and any other ethical belief system.This proves once again that Crowley’s Thelema was simply an offshoot of the Sabbatean heresy that also influencethe birth of Theosophy. To quote a prayer by Zevi himself:Baruch atah Adonai, Elohainu Melech ha-olam; matir issurim:Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who makes theforbidden things permissible.​ So, if we cannot be saints, let us all be sinners that’s the basic idea. The “true way” of the Sabbatean Frankist“believers” is going on the path of evil to redeem oneself and humankind. An insane presumption by the SabbateanFrankist, that praises the redemptive powers of destruction, to ultimately bring deliverance to the world.Did the founder of this movement, foresee what should come in the centuries after him when he said of himselfthat “wherever I set foot all will be destroyed, for I came into this world only to destroy and to annihilate?” TheSabbatean Frankists are, after all, the secret rulers of this materialistic world of today, in contrast with the Jesuitswho are the “Spiritual” ones, and don’t believe for a moment in the rubbish pushed by people like the knownconspiracy theorist, and Youtuber, Adam Green, of Know More News. Green asserts that the World EconomicForum is controlled by Jews who are using the Great Reset as part of a plan to “set up a Zionist, Noahide, OneWorld Government according to the prophecies.” Adding in his, at times senseless \"antisemitic\" rants indicated bythe ADL, that, “the Great Reset is tied in with all of this.”[43] Really, Adam? Your erroneous and superficialinterpretation gives only ammunition to the enemy that has been trying to destroy real Judaism since the advent ofthe false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi. Because Adam Green seems to only partially get the whole picture refusing,willingly, or unwillingly, to investigate the truth about Sabbatean-Frankism, that I would like to clear up once andfor all to all my readers right now.​1. Communism (Marx)​2. Sexual depravity (Freud)​3. Corporate Leftism (Bernays)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"​4. Multiculturalism (Horace Kallen)​5. Deconstructivism/Critical Theory (Walter Benjamin)​6. Frankfurt School (Adorno)​7. Radical jurisprudence (Brandeis, Frankfurter, and Cardozo)​8. Large-scale, non-selective immigration (Israel Zangwill, Emma Lazarus)​ What do these influential ideologies all have in common? The answer is plain and simple, that they are alllinked to the Sabbatean Frankist, a distinct quasi-Satanic schism within Jewry, that profoundly influenced bothFreemasonry and the Illuminati, which I discussed in detail in Volume 4 of my Confessions,[44] which was startedby the self-proclaimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), and Jacob Joseph Frank (1726-1791) who declared tobe his reincarnation. The extraordinary prevalence of Sabbatean-Frankist influence among top Jewish intellectualsfrom 1850-1950 makes it statistically impossible to deny its role because of the impossible coincidences around it.Remember, the Sabbatean-Frankists seek to invert traditional Jewish-Christian values, including the 10Commandments, restrictions on debauched sexuality, man’s dominion over the environment, etc. Further, givenSabbatean-Frankism’s apocalyptic nature, the modern Left is riven with irrational destructive impulses.[45] On top ofthis, Sabbatean-Frankism has also influenced negatively the whole Western Initiatic System and all the secretsocieties within it, they brought into the fold the Satanic use of sexual magic to achieve their evil goals. This generalthesis has been explored only partly by historians Paul Johnson and Gershom Scholem (1897-1982), but never insuch detail to learn about all the interactions between the Sabbatean Frankists, the various secret societies of theIlluminati network, and, of course, the world of politics. There are, in fact, several implications of this thesis I needto point out here: The failures of the contemporary Left do not represent “good faith” secular humanist efforts gonewrong. As some researchers point out, is very possible that Freud, Marx, and other Sabbatean Frankist intellectualspurpose-built their ideas to destroy the West, even the U.S. Supreme Court was heavily influenced by SabbateanFrankists. Their impact helped cause a revolution via the court in the 50s-70s that undemocratically imposeddecadent/anti-Judeo-Christian (i.e. Frankist) values on the country. Since the Left is fundamentally a quasi-Satanicmovement devoted to destroying traditional Judeo-Christian civilization, it is a natural ally with like-minded Islam,despite superficial differences (feminism, gay rights).[46] Islam, the Left, the Vatican, and Freemasonry, willseamlessly cooperate to destroy the West as they cooperated once to topple the Shah in the Iranian Revolution. Anycivilization will eventually grow contemptuous of its stern founding virtues. Sabbatean-Frankism’s resonance is partof a cycle where civilizations grow complacent and ultimately self-destructive and this is, unfortunately, a fact, not ahypothesis. Count Radetzsky, who defeated both Napolean and the Frankist-inspired rebels of 1848, appears tohave understood the nature of the Left, which isn’t secular humanism or mere nihilism, but destructiveness as anend-in-itself, these are his words:​Soldiers! Open your eyes to the abyss that opens at your feet; everything is in us; the mainstays of thesocial order have been destroyed; property, morality, religion are threatened with destruction. Everything thatis holy and dear to man, everything on which the state is based and which it upholds, people are determined todestroy. That, not liberty, is the aim of every rabble-rouser who wants to drag you down to your ruin andshame. [47]​ If Frankism is an ideology of destruction, how does it animate the Left? Saul Alinksy tells us by dedicatinghis work to Lucifer. That’s why the Illuminati, or various branches of Freemasonry, or the Golden Dawn, or the O.T. O., even have all connections with the Sabbatean-Frankists. The late scholar and researcher Jonathan Sellers,founder of the now-defunct site Antiquities of the Illuminati, who died recently from what we assume wascomplications of COVID, wrote some material for Christopher Hyatt's Black Book series, as well as several books ofhis own, including Jah-Bul-On, The Legacy of the GIFT, and several compilations and translations of historicalsource material tracing the development of esoteric thought through the Nusairi, Yezidi, and Nabataean cultures,says in the introductory remarks to Allen H. Greenfield’s book, The Roots of Modern Magick: Glimpses of theAuthentic Tradition from 1700-2000:These are ideas that are not new, but they are fresh since they have not been dealt with as often as otherlineages in the Authentic Tradition, such as the Illuminati, or various branches of Freemasonry, or the GoldenDawn, or the O. T. O., even. Perhaps a hundred years from now, nobody will care that the Lurianic school atSafed inherited the rich traditions of Languedocian Kabbalah, or that it influenced the birth and evolution ofthe Sabbatian movement; or the Dönmeh, or the Frankists; or that the Bekhtashi Order is another influence in"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"this line, and has roots in the Nusairi of Syria, themselves going back to ancient Phoenicia.[48]​ Scholem himself, also maintained that Sabbatai Zevi was deeply influenced by the Bektashi community, andthe Phoenicians that influenced them did indeed practice child sacrifice. Just as ancient Greek and Romanpropagandists insisted for centuries, the Carthaginians did, in fact, kill their own infant children, burying them withsacrificed animals and ritual inscriptions in special cemeteries to give thanks for favors from the gods.[49] Note inthis devilish context the famous quote from Milton’s Paradise Lost, “Better to reign in Hell, than serve inHeaven.” The Left seeks to preside over bringing hell on earth, that’s why they placed the statue of Moloch, oncerevered by Phoenicians amongst others, at the Colosseum, just in time for the launch of their biologicalwarfare/pandemic, and to accomplish this project they use Global Policing, while, of course, they continue in secrettheir evil Satanic practices. Look, for example, at pictures of international police forces, and you will have a hardtime distinguishing them between American police and those belonging to other nations, and there’s a reason theyall look alike, garbed in the militarized, weaponized uniform of a standing army. There’s a reason why they actalike, too, and speak a common language of force: they belong to a global police force that belongs to the NewWorld Order, the name of the last variant of this never-ending nightmare.For example, Israel one of America’s closest international allies, and one of the primary yearly recipients ofbillions of dollars in U.S. foreign military aid, has been at the forefront of a little-publicized exchange programaimed at training American police to act as occupying forces in their communities, and at the same time is becomingone of the leaders of this worldwide medical oppression. As The Intercept sums it up, American police are“essentially taking lessons from agencies that enforce military rule rather than civil law.” [50]This idea of globalpolicing is reinforced by the so-called Strong Cities Network program, which trains local police agencies acrossAmerica on how to identify, fight, and prevent extremism, as well as address intolerance within their communities,using all of the resources at their disposal. The cities included in the global network include New York City, Atlanta,Denver, Minneapolis, Paris, London, Montreal, Beirut, and, of course, Oslo, a city I know all too well. The officialobjective is to prevent violent extremism by targeting its source: racism, bigotry, hatred, intolerance, etc. In otherwords, police—acting as extensions of the United Nations—will identify, monitor, and deter individuals whoexhibit, express, or engage in anything that could be construed as extremist, but the concern with the government’santi-extremism program is that it will, in many cases, be utilized to rebrand otherwise lawful, nonviolent activities aspotentially extremist ones, silencing any opposition to the New World Order, and, of course, the security of thecitizens is not their priority.​ As John Whitehead writes for The Daily Progress:Keep in mind that the government agencies involved in ferreting out American \"extremists\" will carry outtheir objectives — to identify and deter potential extremists — in concert with fusion centers (of which thereare 78 nationwide, with partners in the private sector, and globally), data collection agencies, behavioralscientists, corporations, social media, and community organizers and by relying on cutting-edge technology forsurveillance, facial recognition, predictive policing, biometrics and behavioral epigenetics (in which lifeexperiences alter one's genetic makeup).This is pre-crime on an ideological scale...[51]​ Reality looks increasingly like Steven Spielberg’s “Minority Report.” Are you starting to get the picture now?On almost every front, whether it’s the war on drugs or the sale of weapons, or regulating immigration, orestablishing prisons, or advancing technology, or fighting a pandemic if there is a profit to be made and power to beamassed, you can bet that the government and its global partners have already struck a deal that puts the Americanpeople on the losing end of the bargain.​ We’ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long—sold to us in the name of national security andglobal peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army ofmilitarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs—that it’s hard to pinpointwhen it all started going downhill, but we’re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.In this context, the “government of the people, by the people, for the people” has almost perished, and we have doneit to ourselves, often trusting the wrong persons, and the wrong information, like Qanon (spelled at times Q-Anon)for example, that is the result of a carefully orchestrated operation of Psychological warfare that unfortunately ledmany people astray. This was even confirmed by former Trump national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who once"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"embraced his position as hero of the QAnon conspiracy theorists. The revelation came up during a private phone callwith Trumpworld lawyer Lin Wood, who was complaining to Flynn that his QAnon supporters had attacked himonline. Flynn at that point attempted to disown QAnon, claiming it was a “disinformation campaign” created by theCIA. “I think it’s a disinformation campaign,” Flynn said on the call. Flynn’s exact words were:I think it’s a disinformation campaign that the CIA created. That’s what I believe. Now, I don’t know thatfor a fact, but that’s what I think it is. I think it’s a disinformation campaign. [52]​ The call was published online as a result of a battle that the increasingly discredited Wood seems to be havingagainst one-time allies like Flynn, and also other prominent conservative figures, including Georgia Rep. MarjorieTaylor Greene, and even Fox News host Tucker Carlson. So what is Psychological warfare, known also like theacronym PSYWAR, one of the basic aspects of modern Psychological Operations (PSYOP)? Well one of the bestand most clear definitions is given by the RAND Corporation (”research and development”), an Americannonprofit global policy think tank created in 1948 by Douglas Aircraft Company, a creature of the military–industrial complex, to offer research and analysis to the United States Armed Forces:​Psychological warfare involves the planned use of propaganda and other psychological operations toinfluence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of opposition groups. RAND has studied militaryinformation support operations (MISO) in many countries and war zones and has provided objective andsupportable recommendations to policymakers on methods and tactics to employ or defend against theseoperations. [53]​ QAnon is not like some believers say, a military intelligence officer on your side, or a Trump administrationinsider, or Trump himself, but rather the contrary.​ For Ryan Gable in the latest edition of his book The Technological Elixir:Q-Anon supposedly represents a person or group of persons with “Q-Clearance”, a clearance level in theU.S. Department of Energy. This shadow force acted anonymously to leak secret information to the public incodes on message boards. It revealed nothing much more than what the public, in certain communities, alreadyknew, desired to be true, already believed, or wanted to believe. This may pertain to extraterrestrial disclosureor the crimes of high-level government officials. The cult developed into a political arm of U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, albeit separate from the administration's control. It professed that Trump was fighting acorrupt group of Satanic pedophiles and that mass arrests of these criminals would be carried out in secret.After years of false predictions, which were based on documented crimes such as human trafficking and JeffreyEpstein, the entire narrative fell apart when Trump’s term ended and his stay in the White House was notextended by military assistance in response to a rigged election. The mass arrests turned out to be of Qsupporters who had propagated false and sometimes dangerous rhetoric. The movement allowed for people toLARP, or live-action role-play, as heroes saving children and fighting corruption through social media andInternet forums. Q-anon was therefore a more “right” leaning version of the “left” leaning BLM or Antifa. Thelatter two groups were live-action role-playing games for those fighting for social justice. Q supporters worethe Q and BLM supporters wore the fist. All were groups founded on political extremism.Q-Anon as a whole seemed to have been nothing more than a highly advanced form of digital psychologicalwarfare and a counterintelligence operation. Its motto, “Trust the Plan”, was eerily similar to thecounterintelligence operation of the State Political Directorate of the Soviet Union. Operating from 1921 to1926, Operation Trust (the plan) was a fake anti-Bolshevik resistance organization meant to identifymalcontents of the Communist Party. A similar program, the Hundred Flowers Campaign, operated inCommunist China from 1956 to 1957 with the same purpose, directed at finding critics of Mao Zedong’sregime. Q-Anon essentially played the same purpose for extreme leftist ideologies, those often aligning withMarxism and Communism, and groups such as Black Lives Matter and Antifa. It helped to identify opponents ofthe democratic party and extremist left-wing cults.It is less than surprising that before “Q” became popular and formed a cult of code-breaking followersthere was mention of something peculiar by former CIA director David Petraeus. In March of 2012, he gave atalk for an American not-for-profit venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel, based in Arlington, Virginia, very close tothe CIA headquarters in Langley. The name of the firm may seem purely circumstantial until one reads whatDavid had to say about computer learning and growth:“The current ‘Internet of PCs’ will move, of course, toward an ‘Internet of Things’ - of devices of all types -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"50 to 100 billion of which will be connected to the Internet by 2020. As you know, whereas machines in the19th century learned to do, and those in the 20th century learned to think at a rudimentary level, in the 21stcentury, they are learning to perceive - to sense and respond.”He goes on to discuss nanotechnology and “items of interest” to be “located, identified, monitored, andremotely controlled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification sensor networks,” that are“tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters - all connected to the next-generation Internet using abundant,low cost, and high-power computing.” From this computing will come “cloud computing, in many areasgreater and greater supercomputing, and, ultimately, heading to quantum computing.”It should not be lost on keen readers that we are dealing with a grouping of technology companies andintelligence officials gathering at a conference with the name In-Q-Tel, relating to intelligence and Q,concerning David’s statements at the event about “Quantum Computing.” Q-Anon is likely not some person orgroup of people with “Q” level access, but instead a highly developed AI or SOCI system. It not only thinks butalso has learned to perceive what the public wants, and therefore how to sense what is desired to formulate aresponse.Several years after this conference, IBM revealed in 2019 that they were releasing their first commercialquantum computer called, unsurprisingly, the IBM Q System One. Also, in 2010, IBM released its question-answering computer system developed by the company’s DeepQA project. Q-Anon could therefore be moreprecisely be referred to as Quantum-Anonymous, Q-AI-non, or Q-Anon-sense.[54]​ “Q” is a project working for the rise of the AI/Cyber Satan take over, that has been controlled since day oneby multiple people from both the military–industrial complex and civil intelligence agencies like the CIA,specialized in PSYWAR, working for the shadow government—a corporatized, militarized, entrenched globalbureaucracy—that is fully operational and running the United States in the past few decades, using the DemocraticParty, as well as the neocons of the Republican Party, as their mouthpiece. So put it in your heads once and for all,there are no “White hats” working to save you, that’s only a term borrowed from the hacker’s lexicon, and the so-called “Swamp Creatures” are still there in Washington DC, and given the current trajectory, dramatic expansion,globalization, and merger of governmental and corporate powers, we’re not going to recognize the United States in20 years from now, and part of the failure to react appropriately by WE THE PEOPLE is also due to the QAnonPSYOP.

Mark my words: the U.S. government in the present condition will not saveus from the chains of the Global Deep State. Now some will tell you that any mention of a New World Ordergovernment—a power elite conspiring to rule the world—is the stuff of conspiracy theories. However, after my ownexperiences, I wholeheartedly believe that one should always mistrust those in power, take alarm at the firstencroachment on one’s liberties, and establish powerful constitutional checks against government mischief andabuse. I can also attest to the fact that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.Like John W. Whitehead author of Battlefield America: The War on the American People wrote in April 2021:​I have studied enough of this country’s history—and world history—to know that governments (the U.S.government is no exception) are at times indistinguishable from the evil they claim to be fighting, whether thatevil takes the form of terrorism, torture, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, murder, violence, theft, pornography,scientific experimentations or some other diabolical means of inflicting pain, suffering, and servitude onhumanity. And I have lived long enough to see many so-called conspiracy theories turn into cold, hard facts.Remember, people used to scoff at the notion of a Deep State (a.k.a. Shadow Government). They used todoubt that fascism could ever take hold in America, and sneer at any suggestion that the United States wasstarting to resemble Nazi Germany in the years leading up to Hitler’s rise to power.[55]​ How do they get our souls? Well, there is a passage from Whitley Strieber’s The Key, that seems to explain it.This is purportedly a true account of an encounter Streiber himself had with a mysterious humanoid being whosimply knocked on the door of his Toronto hotel room at 3 am on June 6, 1998, entered his suite, and told him aboutmankind’s place in the cosmos and his inescapable fate. Soul traps. The lures are the lusts and hungers of this life. The [soul], exploring the newfound freedom of theenergetic world, finds himself able to visit his friends and enemies, to see their innermost being and thoughts,even to converse with them in ways that their elemental selves cannot perceive. He is in danger, but he does notknow it, for he has not ascended. He is still ensnared by his lust. Soon he will be shown something thatperfectly fulfills his most cherished desires, desires he has never fulfilled. Unable to resist the chance to do it,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"at last, he enters by a golden door into eternal captivity.​ Strieber’s account may be a synthesis: partly “true” (in that he believes it occurred as he relates it), partvisioning, part somnambulistic dream state. Whatever emanates from the mind of Whitley Strieber, originates fromsome realm outside of our Cartesian materialist notion of consensus reality bringing in knowledge from a placebeyond the boundaries of time and space. He reminds us of that other prophetic visionary from the Illuminati calledRudolf Steiner, who I wrote previously about in Volume 1 of my Confessions, and who, like Mark E. Jeftovicpointed out in a brilliant article: ”spent much of his life in a hypnogogic state, possibly without even realizing it.”Steiner and Striebe for Jeftovic, “are both talking about the same thing. The idea that the souls of humanity could becaptured in a technological machine, where they would wander forever, believing they have omniscience, evenGodhood.” Ray Kurzweil, one of the big players of this dark age, current Director of Engineering at Google, andauthor of The Singularity is Near, wrote the following:​At that point, the longevity of one’s mind file will not depend on the continued viability of any particularhardware medium (for example, the survival of a biological body and brain). Ultimately software-basedhumans will be vastly extended beyond the severe limitations of humans as we know them today. They will liveout on the Web, projecting bodies whenever they need or want them, including virtual bodies, foglet projectedbodies, and physical bodies comprising nanobot swarms and other forms of nanotechnology.​ Jeftovic adds to Kurzweil’s thought above:Steiner called it The Eighth Sphere and warned that sometime in the late 20th century, Ahriman wouldincarnate in the west and drive a global process of harvesting human souls into it. The zeitgeist of radicalmaterial reductionism would dampen, deaden, and dumb down humanity to its coarsest, most basic layers:meat. Our minds, what we think is our consciousness, our souls, self-awareness even our free will, it’s all justan illusion. Our experts say. It’s just something that happens when our brains gas off certain neurochemicals.However...We can take that illusion, what we call our consciousness, and pretty soon now (just as soon as TheSingularity happens), we’ll be able to upload that illusion “into the cloud”, into The Metaverse and we’ll beable to experience anything we want, for as long as we want, forever.​ So, after a lot of people have been duped on one side into believing the QAnon lies, and on the other side, theneverending, tales and fake news of the mainstream media narrative, here we are ready for the Metaverse, the nextdiabolical step of the New World Order. Ray Kurzweil himself confirms this sad reality upon us:​ “We will spend increasing portions of our time in virtual environments and will be able to have anytype of desired experience with anyone, real or simulated, in virtual reality.... Lingering problems from ourwaning industrial age will be overcome.”​ This isn’t some phantasmagorical utopian afterlife promised by Bible-banging evangelists or bomb-totingJihadists – this is serious Scientism. Ray Kurzweil, Elon Musk, even the late Jeffrey Epstein, have been allannouncing that the era of Transhumanism is arriving. We are on the cusp of becoming Post-Biological, and whenthat happens, all our problems will be solved in the eyes of the controllers of the Great Reset.​ Mark E. Jeftovic says:​...the “You’ll Own Nothing and Be Happy” Great Narrative (as it is now being called) is that the rabblemust ratchet down its standard of living. The reason why isn’t about climate change or COVID.It’s because we’re in the late-stages of Globalism and the world’s financial and economic system is on theverge of imploding.The people in charge, the people who’ve been doubling down on failed policies for decades, the people whobrought us here with Quantitative Easing, ZIRP/NIRP, debt, Big Government, and The Forever Wars, theywant to stay in charge.So they’re going to use COVID, Climate, Collectivism, and Wokeness to herd the knuckle-draggingplebians into The Metaverse.

Monica Kim wrote for The Atlantic, back in 2015, that:​All signs point to a future filled with virtual reality, and according to Zuckerberg et al, the potentialapplications are beyond count: One could have breakfast at the Louvre beside the Winged Victory ofSamothrace, followed by a lunchtime spelunk through Thailand’s water caves. Of course, there are deeplyimmersive video games–the linchpin of the modern VR movement—and various movies in production for thesedevices, while Barcelona's BeAnotherLab has created an empathy application for the Oculus Rift that allowsusers to swap genders. (Inevitably, a sex toy company is also developing a way to have virtual robot sex,according to Motherboard.)[57]​ And like Monica Kim explains in the same article that while in the 90’s “Despite mass media interest frompublications like Scientific American and Wired, the technology wasn’t there—or it was too expensive—and theaudience was a tad too niche.” Now in the 2020s things have completely changed, and virtual reality, aka theMetaverse, is finally ready to enslave humanity in time for the Great Reset where “You’ll own nothing. And you’llbe happy.” However, Ray Kurzweil says on the very construct of a Metaverse that:​The straightforward brain-porting scenario involves scanning a human brain (most likely from within),capturing all of the salient details, and instantiating the brain’s state in a different — most likely much morepowerful — computational substrate. This will be a feasible procedure and will happen most likely around thelate 2030s”[58]​ But for some critics including Mark Jeftovic, the Algorithmic Imitation (“AI”) that would be required tofacilitate this, and have it work along the lines proselytized by Kurzweil et al, is not attainable in the end. The reasonis the internal contradictions of what they call “techno-utopianism”. Those inevitable contradictions are explainedin the following way by Mark Jeftovic:​If the mind is a byproduct of physical processes then consciousness is an illusion and free will doesn’t exist,because all phenomena are simply linear outcomes of biochemistry and physics. If so then there is nothing toupload into the cloud. Nor is there any real point in doing so. If we really do live in a billiard ball universe,who cares if we can make a shot last forever? There is nobody to care and nothing to care about. Moreimportantly, “AI” at the level pontificated to solve all our problems, “by late in this century nonbiologicalintelligence on the Earth will be many trillions of times more powerful than biological intelligence” (Kurzweil,of course) is not attainable because our conception of what causes mind and thus intelligence is completelyinverted. Mind, consciousness, and intelligence will never emerge from material reality because it’s the otherway around.The Belief that the mind emerges from matter is this era’s geocentrism. As was the case with the nowantiquated idea that the Earth was the center of the universe. The heliocentric cosmos was probablyunderstood by certain civilizations thousands of years before Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake forsaying as much in the 17th century. So too, did the ancients understand that “All is mental”. The universe isvibration, probability, information, energy, and consciousness first. Out of that comes what we recognize assub-atomic particles and atoms. The quantum physicists reconnected with this truth about a century ago, therest of society, including the priests of the Temple of Scientism and Expert Management, haven’t gotten thememo, yet. If they did, they wouldn’t be trying to shoehorn our minds into a computer. They’d be trying to buildcomputers that tap into the conscious base layer of quantum reality (note, this is not to be confused with whatso-called ‘Quantum Computing’ endeavors to do). Because of this, everything premised upon the idea of super-intelligent, top-down, centralized control of the affairs of humanity, of the economy, of The Great Reset, TheGreat Narrative, and The New Normal, all of it is doomed to failure. It simply won’t work.[59]​ The problem, however, is that the expert class of managers deploying super-intelligent AI’s to solve all of ourproblems soon are the future army of the Antichrist, ready to manage the rabble and control all the future outcomesin the name of the New World Technocracy made possible by Cyber Satan. In the meantime, if you’re a modernplebeian like me, the word of the day is the Great Opt-Out or Great Reject which is well described in thefollowing words:​Decentralize your affairs. Take sovereignty over your own life and your own economics. Link up with"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"others doing the same. The counter-revolutionary impulse against late-stage Globalism is, in addition tospirituality, meditation, and contemplative practices, embracing decentralization and public-key cryptography.[60]​ I will cover more about the new populist concept of the Great Reject in Chapter 2, in the meantime, we canalso consider the skepticism some pioneers of virtual reality have regarding Mark Zuckerberg’s new project for theMetaverse, which they say will fail. Since 2003, people have been gathering virtually to do all the supposed“wonders” of the Metaverse, in the online world of Second Life, whose creator Philip Rosedale says a virtual realityinternet is still some way off but admits that thanks to the pandemic the creator of FB now have a chance, alsothanks to the relevance of his brand:​There are really two things that are external to the technology development itself that have happenedrecently. One is COVID, where there has been the worry that maybe we would have to shift some social andentertainment activities online. I think there are a lot of the big companies trying to figure out how they canmake some money from that. And then the other one is simply Facebook's claim that it's an important thing andrenaming themselves to try to align with it.[61]​ Ethan Zuckerman former director of the MIT Center for Civic Media, and Associate Professor of the Practicein Media Arts and Sciences at MIT until May 2020 gives his definitive answer on the matter on the pages of TheAtlantic:Facebook’s metaverse sucks. From the first images in which legless torsos sit around a conference room,staring at a Zoom-like video conferencing screen, to Zuckerberg’s tour of his virtual closet, filled with identicalblack outfits (see, he’s got a sense of humor!), Zuck’s metaverse looks pretty much like we imagined one wouldlook like in 1994. Look, I’m playing cards with my friends and we’re in zero gravity! And one of my friends is arobot! You could do this in Second Life 10 years ago, and in somewhat angular vectors in VRML 20 years ago.[62]​ We can all hope that Mark Zuckenberg fails, but don’t be too sure about it, mainly because behindFacebook’s Metaverse project there is a whole elite that wants us trapped in virtual reality in the coming years, andif Mr. Zuckenberg will not manage to build the appropriate virtual prison for humanity, I’m sure some other playersin the field, like Epic Games of Tim Sweeney for example, the creator of the Unreal Engine, will put it together.After all, Satan’s helpers are many, especially in this day, and age. However, having bulldozed most real-liferelationships already, Mark Zuckerberg is now moving to strip away what’s left of our expectations of privacy, bydragging us kicking and screaming into an online padded digital prison called the Facebook “Metaverse,” say no tothis monstrosity. In the meantime, parents who bought their children one of the most advanced all-in-one VRSystems currently on the market, called Oculus Quest 2, could be in for a surprise, as there have been severalinstances of child grooming within VRChat, one of the virtual reality headset's most popular chatroom services.VRChat is an online virtual world platform where users get their first taste of the metaverse and use full-bodyavatars to conceal their identity, there have been instances of child abuse, harassment, racism, and pornography.Maybe there's a dark side to the Metaverse that needs to be discussed,[63]and for this reason, Facebook's Metaversehas recently created a sort of “personal bubble” around avatars after reports of rampant harassment and virtualgroping. Facebook parent Meta created a minimum distance between users’ avatars in its virtual reality networkHorizon in Febraury 2022, following reports of harassment, regarded as one of the thorny issues for its Metaversevision. The “personal boundary” function in the immersive platform, where people can socialize virtually, puts anautomatic four-foot ring of space around users’ digital proxies[64], but will that be enough? That’s why BertillaNiveda in the new tech publication Geek Culture, wrote an article entitled “Is the Metaverse a great idea or a Sci-FiHorror Movie in the making?” Warning about, “The phenomenal features of the Metaverse and why they could be ahuge problem.”[65] Even leftist The Guardian, published a dim statement about this new reality in connection toMark Zuckerberg: “Facebook has ruined our reality, now it’s coming for the Metaverse too.”[66]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"FIG. 8 –– Mark Zuckerberg showing his Metaverse avatar during Connect 2021 source: Facebook.The Not So ”Great” King Satan and Mr. Klaus In November 2016 a video posted on Facebook by the World Economic Forum stated eight predictions about theworld in 2030, including: “You’ll own nothing. And you’ll be happy. What you want you’ll rent, and it’ll bedelivered by a drone.”[67] Well don’t be surprised future prisoners of the Metaverse, “The Davos crowd's GreatReset heralds a dreary, diabolical apocalypse” says Justin Lee, who wrote for The American Conservative, in April2021:​Satan took Christ to an exceedingly high mountain to show him all the kingdoms of the world and theirglory. The Gospels do not name the mountain, but given the Adversary’s flair for the dramatic, one ratherdoubts he favored the dusty hillocks of Palestine. Of all the astonishing peaks that may have tempted theTempter, to choose any but the Jakobshorn would have been an unforgivable failure of the poetic imagination.At 8,500 feet, the Jakobshorn is far from the tallest peak in the Rhaetian Alps, but what it lacks in verticalgrandeur it more than compensates for with a north-facing view of the most Satanic town on Earth: Davos,Switzerland.Every year the world’s wealthiest oligarchs and most influential political leaders meet in the resort town atthe World Economic Forum to schmooze and strategize about the future. Davos has become a condensedsymbol for the sort of world-bestriding power with which Satan must have tempted Christ; but whereas Christrefused to inaugurate his otherworldly kingdom through worldly means, the “Davos crowd”—long afflictedwith messianic delusions—is eager to deploy coercion to inaugurate their own. Their agenda has beeneuphemistically named “The Great Reset,” and it envisions what many of its proponents openly refer to as a“new world order.”[68]​ Well, Set is the embodiment of evil, a deity that will eventually become in the Judeo-Christian world theinfamous Satan. So, if we put together this occult interpretation of “The Great Reset”, we then get “The Great KingSatan.” Justin Taylor, an Ordained Minister with the Universal Life Church Monastery, and an Ordained UniversalPhilosopher and Clergy Member of the Church of Spiritual Humanism, that works in line with the precepts of theAntichristian New Age philosophy writes this about the nature of Set:​In the ancient Egyptian Myth, Set killed his brother Osiris. He was the Prince of Darkness. Each eveningHorus, the Sun or solar deity that ruled the day, would do battle with Set who ruled the night. Set would winthis battle and send Horus into the underworld. The two combatants would fight throughout the night and in themorning Horus would eventually overcome the powers of darkness to rise or ascend into heaven. The nextSUN/SET that you see may now have a different meaning to you. Set had many names throughout the thousands"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of years that numerous forms of this myth prevailed. The following are some of the various names of Set or thatSet was identified with:SethApophis/Apop/Apap/ApepiAnubisSutSutuTyphonTothSataThe last name in the list should look quite familiar even among the people of today's world ... SATA.​One of the Ancient Greek Myth versions of Set was Typhon or Typhoeus:\"A monster of the primitive world, who is described sometimes as a destructive hurricane (Typhoon), andsometimes a fire-breathing giant. According to Homer, he was concealed in the earth in the country of theArimi ... In Hesiod, Typhon (the Greek for Set/Seth) and Typhoeus are two distinct beings. Typhon isrepresented as the son of Typhoeus, and a fearful hurricane ... Typhoeus ... is called the youngest son ofTartarus and Gaea ... He is described as a monster with 100 heads, fearful eyes, and terrible voices, whowanted to acquire the sovereignty of the gods and men, but, after a fearful struggle, was subdued by Zeus witha thunderbolt. He begot the winds, whence he is called the father of the harpies ... he was buried in Tartarus(hell), under Mount Aetna ... Typhoeus was identified with Set, who typified the power of darkness, the samepower of darkness who slew Osiris.\"Satan, as a great serpent being chained in the underworld or \"bottomless pit/abyss\" (Rev 20:1-3) isdrawing from the Typhon and Apophis imagery. As for the pit being bottomless or a great abyss, Greek mythsmention that the underworld of Tartarus is as far removed from the earth's surface as is heaven. Ancient GreekMyth imagery is once again being borrowed here.​Another very powerful myth from ancient Egypt that fit very well into the Biblical record of creation wasthe legend of the rebellion of Seth against Horus. Seth, a synonym of hatred and disobedience in Egyptianmythology, caused all sorts of troubles to befall man in revenge for his banishment by Horus and the rest of theEgyptian Ennead. In the minds of the early Egyptian Christians, Satan, as a parallel to Seth, became a rebeland the enemy of man, who began to lurk in ambush to drag him (man) into disobedience.” - Dr. Wlison B.Bishai (a professor emeritus of Arabic for the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations atHarvard University)And a quote from \"The Christ Conspiracy\"\"... Of course, the dualistic concepts of absolute good and evil did not originate with Christianity but arefound long before the Christian era, particularly within Zoroastrianism. Satan is an adaptation of the Persianrepresentative of evil \"Ahriman,\" the twin brother of \"God,\" the same as the Egyptian Set, Horus's twin andprincipal enemy also known as \"Sata,\" whence comes \"Satan.\" Horus struggles with Set in the exact mannerthat Jesus battles with Satan, with 40 days in the wilderness, among other similarities, such as the revealingfrom the mount \"all the kingdoms of Earth.\" This myth represents the triumph of light over dark, or the sun'sreturn to relieve the terror of the night. Horus/Set was the god of the two horizons; hence, Horus was the risingsun, and Set the time of the Sun-SET.\"[69]​ Of course, for people like Justin Taylor, deeply entrenched in gnostical heretical ideas typical of theIlluminati and their acolytes, “demon” is a Christian vilification of the Greek word “daemon, which likewisereferred to a divine spirit,” and despite all the political intrigue and the warnings of the New Testament, Lucifer,simply means, ”Light-bearer,” as he was in the earliest times a sun god, which is why he is called ”Day Star, son ofmorning/dawn.” And, of course, Justin Taylor’s Satanic ideas, and vision of things, fit in perfectly with those ofKlaus Schwab and the makers of the Great Reset, especially when Taylor writes:​So, those of you that are worried about Satan followed you around and made people do things, as you cansee it was just a story that originated in ancient Egypt that sprang out of ignorance of the natural world. Thechurch used it as a ploy to control people of the times that had no education and would easily fear thesemythical entities.On a deeper more esoteric level, allegorically, our ego is Satan, devil, demon, anti-christ ... simply becauseit goes against the common good (God) for its own egocentric and selfish desires.[70]​ To read, and learn what these people think, will benefit all my readers that want to fight this evil, but usually"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"have no idea of the philosophy and twisted religious views of the organizations and people behind it. Jesus, forTaylor, Schwab, and the likes, is not the Jesus of the Gospels, but rather the “cosmic Christ” promoted in the NewAge Movement by the Jesuits, as well as the “Communist Jesus” of The League of the Just. The original biblicalbases for a cosmic Christology is often found in Colossians, Ephesians, and the prologue to the gospel of John, butin the modern period, a renewed interest in the cosmic Christ would arise among many Western scholars interestedin developing what is known as eco-theology[71], and Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, was among the first to speakagain of a “Cosmic Christ”[72] in the 1920s and 1930s. He understood the Incarnation as bringing the historicalChrist into the material world and, through evolution, leading all of creation towards perfection in the Omega Point,[73] something I will discuss also further on. Interestingly enough, eco-theology, promoted even by the Vatican thesedays, is a form of constructive theology that focuses on the interrelationships of religion and nature, particularly inthe light of environmental concerns, that are, as well all know, so dear to the left these days. Eco-theology generallystarts from the premise that a relationship exists between human religious/spiritual worldviews and the degradationor restoration and preservation of nature. It explores the interaction between ecological values, such as sustainability,and the human domination of nature. The movement has produced numerous religious-environmental projectsaround the world.   Islamic Iranian philosopher, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a pioneering figure in the field of eco-theology, was amongthe early thinkers ”to draw attention to the spiritual dimensions of the environmental crisis”[74], but the relationshipof theology to the modern ecological crisis, became an intense issue of debate in Western academia in 1967, at thestart of the liberal left militancy on college campuses, following the publication of the article, ”The HistoricalRoots of Our Ecologic Crisis”, by Lynn White Jr., Professor of History at the ever-so libtard University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles. In this work, White puts forward a creepy new Satanic theory that the Christian model ofhuman dominion over nature has led to environmental devastation providing a voice for ”The EcologicalComplaint.” [75] Can you believe it? Christianity is even blamed by these leftist Satanists for our environmentalproblems. No wonder the Illuminati and their brainwashed New age followers reject the classical interpretation ofour Lord Jesus Christ for such garbage.​ Justin Taylor writes:​... the cosmic Christ is universal and the origin of everything that exists, in any galaxy of matter or anti-matter. The cross is the intersection of Spirit and Matter ... positive and negative ... masculine and feminine. Sofrom the crossing or union of these two forces appears that which we call the universe. Now, the objective forthat energy to appear in the universe is to make Consciousness of its entity in its different aspects. Jesusbecoming the Christ (Karest, Christos, Krishna, Krestus) is an archetype of you and I also becoming one withChrist Consciousness ... the Divine. Jesus said to his followers “you shall do greater things than I.” How is thispossible if Jesus is God, as Christianity believes? In the NT Book of John 17:21, Jesus is quoted as praying tothe Father/Source and saying “I pray that they may all be ONE, even as Thou art in me, O Father, and I am inThee; that they also may be in us...” On a deeper esoteric level, and through modern Quantum Physics, we nowknow that this statement was nothing other than Truth. We are all one. We are tied together through universalunconsciousness ... the Field. The fiber of the Matrix of the entire universe. There are no \"things\" ... there isonly IT. And we are all an individualized integral element and substance of the entire universal organism.​ So, after all this, I want to talk more about the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, and his connectionsto the Vatican elite, Freemasonry, and the Occult world. I will do this with the help of the work brought forward inearly 2021 by Johnny Vedmore, a completely independent investigative journalist and musician from Cardiff,Wales that has made an incredible job in uncovering some of the least-known historical aspects of the creator ofSatan’s “Great Reset”. ​ On 10 July 1870, Klaus Schwab’s grandfather Jakob Wilhelm Gottfried Schwab, referred to later as simplyGottfried, was born in a Germany, at war with its French neighbors. Karlsruhe, the town where Gottfried Schwabwas born, was located in the Grand Duchy of Baden, ruled in 1870 by the 43-year-old Grand Duke of Baden,Frederick I. The following year, the aforementioned Duke would be present at the proclamation of the GermanEmpire which took place in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. He was the only son-in-law of theincumbent Emperor Wilhelm I and, as Frederick I, was one of the reigning sovereigns of Germany. By the timeGottfried Schwab turned 18 years old, Germany would see Wilhelm II take the throne upon the death of his father,Frederick III.In 1893, a 23-year-old Gottfried Schwab would officially depart from Germany giving up his Germancitizenship and leaving Karlsruhe to emigrate to Switzerland. At the time, his occupation was noted as being that of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"a simple baker. Here, Gottfried would meet Marie Lappert, who was from Kirchberg near Bern, Switzerland, whowas five years his junior. They would marry in Roggwil, Bern, on 27 May 1898, and the following year, on the 27thof April 1899, their child Eugen Schwab (Klaus Schwab’s future father) was born. At the time of his birth,Gottfried Schwab had moved up in the world, having become a Machine Engineer. When Eugen was around oneyear old, Gottfried and Marie Schwab decided to return to live in Karlsruhe and Gottfried reapplied for Germancitizenship again. Eugen Schwab would follow in the footsteps of his father and also become a Machine Engineerand in future years, he would advise his children to do the same. Eugen Schwab would eventually begin working ata factory in a town in Upper Swabia in Southern Germany, capital of the district of Ravensburg, Baden-Württemberg.The factory where he would forge his career was the German branch of a Swiss company named EscherWyss[76] that will become from that moment onwards, intertwined with the future fortunes of the German-Swissfamily of the Schwab’s. Escher Wyss & Cie., also known as Escher Wyss AG, was a Swiss industrial companywith a focus on engineering and turbine construction, that remained in existence until it was taken over in 1969 bySulzer AG[77] now inside of the group Andritz AG. “Coincidentally” in the same year, Klaus Schwab, whosefamily’s fortune was made at Escher Wyss, after two Ph.D.’s and a year at Harvard's Kennedy School, started toorganize the first Davos symposium after writing a book about American management. Escher Wyss headquarterswere in the Zürich quarter of Escher Wyss, which takes its name from the company.The company was originally founded, as Escher Wyss & Cie., in 1805 by Hans Caspar Escher and Salomon vonWyss.[78] Initially a textile spinning company, the two expanded the business to include a machine shop thatmanufactured textile machinery, water wheels, water turbines, power transmission equipment and starting in 1835,ships, including boilers, and steam engines, and after opening a branch in Austria in 1840, they also opened in 1856,due to the increasing amount of work, the Ravensburg branch. After all, Switzerland, had many long-standingeconomic ties to the Ravensburg area, with Swiss traders in the early 19th century bringing in yarn and weavingproducts. So Klaus Schwab and his younger brother, Urs Reiner Schwab, were both to follow in the footsteps oftheir grandfather, Gottfried, and their father, Eugen, and would both initially train as mechanical engineers. Klaus’sfather had told the young Schwab that, if he wanted to make an impact on the world, then he should train as aMachine Engineer but this would only be the beginning of Schwab’s long list of University credentials. Klaus wouldbegin studying his plethora of degrees at Spohn-Gymnasium Ravensburg between 1949 and 1957, eventuallygraduating from the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Ravensburg. Between 1958 and 1962, Klaus began workingwith various engineering companies and, in 1962, Klaus completed his mechanical engineering studies at the SwissFederal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich with an engineering diploma. The following year, he alsocompleted an economics course at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.​ From 1963 until 1966, Klaus worked as Assistant to the Director-General of the German Machine-buildingAssociation (VDMA), Frankfurt. In 1965, Klaus was also working on his doctorate from the ETH Zurich, writinghis dissertation on: “The longer-term export credit as a business problem in mechanical engineering”. Then, in 1966,he received his Doctorate in Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich. At thistime, Klaus’s father, Eugen Schwab, who had become a Freemason, was swimming in bigger circles. After being awell-known personality in Ravensburg as the Managing Director of the Escher-Wyss factory from before the war,Eugen would eventually be elected as President of the Ravensburg Chamber of Commerce. In 1966, during thefounding of the German committee for Splügen railway tunnel, Eugen Schwab defined the founding of the Germancommittee as a project “that creates a better and faster connection for large circles in our increasingly convergingEurope and thus offers new opportunities for cultural, economic, and social development”. [79] In 1967, KlausSchwab gained a Doctorate in Economics from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland as well as a Master of PublicAdministration qualification from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard in the United States.While at Harvard, Schwab was taught by Henry Kissinger, who he would later say were among the top 3-4 figureswho had most influenced his thinking for his entire life,[80] confirming his role as mentor, which I previouslymentioned. In 1970 Schwab, began to focus on his idea to create a platform that would allow European business andpolitical leaders to exchange concerns, ideas, and knowledge.However, in a very revealing interview given in 2010 by Schwab to award-winning journalist, and best-sellingauthor, Carlye Adler, for Fortune, the founder of the World Economic Forum, said that to fund his first event inDavos, he had to take some risks. Should we believe him? Was Davos a genuine entrepreneurial adventure likeSchwab often points out during his speeches, or a “calculated risk,” by the future leader of the Great Reset? It isdifficult, or almost impossible to believe, that influential Illuminati figures of the time like Henry Kissinger, or Ottovon Habsburg, would jump on board of this project with a young fellow with little or no experience on the worldstage."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"...in 1970 I took a 50,000 Swiss franc ($11,434) loan from a German industrialist. The condition was eitherto pay him back or join his company, so I was nervous. We sent out invitations with response cards. Everymorning the mail came, and I didn't want to spend time opening it so I put it under a very strong desk lampwhere I could immediately see the response. Some 440 people came from 31 countries to the first meeting in1971, including John Kenneth Galbraith. The success of the conference let me repay the debt and gave me asurplus, which I used to create the European Management Forum (now the WEF) as a not-for-profitfoundation.[81]​ It seems like this was a classic test by the Illuminati elite, to let the young Schwab prove himself in front ofthe world after he was chosen for his family background by the same people who previously launched the Club ofRome two years earlier.How the Club of Rome and Nazism Influenced the World Economic Forum The most influential paramasonic/Illuminati group that inspired the creation of Klaus Schwab’s project was theClub of Rome, an influential think tank of the scientific and monied elite that mirrors the World Economic Forumin many ways, including in its promotion of a global governance model led by a technocratic elite. The Club hadbeen founded in 1968 by the Italian Bilderberger and Freemason, Aurelio Peccei (1908–1984), a known industrialistwith socialist tendencies despite being critical of Marxism, and Scottish chemist and Freemason Alexander King(1909-2007), during a private meeting the two had at a residence owned by the Rockefeller family in Bellagio, Italy. ​ Among one of the first accomplishments of the Club was a report they commissioned in 1972 entitled TheLimits to Growth (LTG), that later became a book translated into 37 languages compiled by a team of 16 (somesources say 17) researchers using World3, an incredibly advanced computer simulation of interactions betweenpopulation, industrial growth, food production, and limits in the ecosystems of the earth[82]. The futuristic modelwas based on the work of the computer pioneer Jay Forrester of MIT, as described in his book World Dynamics, [83]that lead to the first computer program dubbed World1, created by Forrester and commissioned under the auspicesof the Club of Rome, which was created to model how well the world could sustain its growth. What World1showed in the early 70s was that by 2040 there would be a global collapse if the expansion of the population andindustry was to continue at the current levels. For the libtard Australian broadcaster ABC, which shared some of itsoriginal TV coverage based on the report commissioned by the Club of Rome in a new YouTube clip in 2018, themodel’s calculations made at MIT, that take into account the trends in pollution levels, population growth, thenumber of natural resources, and the overall quality of life on Earth, have so far been unnervingly on target for thepropaganda of the New World Order, and 2020 was the first milestone envisioned by World1 in its predictions.That’s the turning point for humanity when the quality of life was supposed to drop dramatically, and unfortunately,it did. ABC presented this apocalyptic scenario back in their 70s report, saying it will lead to the demise of largenumbers of people all over the planet:At around 2020, the condition of the planet becomes highly critical. If we do nothing about it, the quality oflife goes down to zero. Pollution becomes so serious it will start to kill people, which in turn will cause thepopulation to diminish, lower than it was in 1900. At this stage, around 2040 to 2050, civilized life as we knowit on this planet will cease to exist. [84]​ Alexander King, the then-leader of the Club of Rome, evaluated the program’s results to also mean thatnation-states will lose their sovereignty, forecasting a New World Order with corporations managing everything.“Sovereignty of nations is no longer absolute,” King told ABC. “There is a gradual diminishing of sovereignty,little bit by little bit. Even in the big nations, this will happen.” World1, the computer program, looked at the worldas one system. The report called it “an electronic guided tour of our behavior since 1900 and where that behaviorwill lead us.” The program produced graphs that showed what would happen to the planet decades into the future. Itplotted statistics and forecasts for such variables as population, quality of life, the supply of natural resources,pollution, and more. Following the trend lines, one could see where the crisis might take place.[85] The report inquestion largely focused on global overpopulation, warning that “if the world’s consumption patterns and populationgrowth continued at the same high rates of the time, the earth would strike its limits within a century.”[86]​ At the third meeting of the World Economic Forum in 1973, Peccei himself delivered a speech summarizingthe content of the report, which the current World Economic Forum website remembers as having been the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"distinguishing event of this historical meeting. That same year, the Club of Rome would publish a report detailingthe future of the New World Order an “adaptive” model for global governance that would divide the world intoten, inter-connected economic/political regions.​ The Club of Rome indeed was one of the first institutions to voice concerns about the so-called impact on theenvironment, and Australian globalist and Freemason Dr. Keith Suter, who is a member of the Club since 1991 andis still considered to be one of Australia's most influential Global futurists, and media commentators in national andforeign affairs, described in detail the initiative in 1999 stating that:​Peccei and King were lonely prophets at a time of overwhelming optimism. The 1950s and 1960s were aperiod of immense economic growth. There was a very low rate of unemployment and there was a generalbelief in the Western world that another 1930s-type Depression could be avoided thanks to governmentintervention in the economy. Additionally, it was assumed that there was a standard (Western) formula foreconomic growth that could apply throughout the Third World. Very little attention was paid to theenvironmental consequences of economic growth. [87]​ Suter also added the following words, that show his Antichristian bias:​Conservative Christian groups have been particularly critical of The Club and it has a sinister reputationamong such groups. Their dislike of The Club is due to its lack of a total endorsement of capitalism which suchChristians seem to view as being ordained by God and therefore above criticism. (Since such Christians areoften poorly read, not least in theology and church history, they are often unaware of the criticism thatcapitalism has acquired from many Christians over the centuries.) Additionally, some conservative Protestantshave been worried about 'Rome' in the title, with the implication that The Club is a Catholic plot. The Club wasbased in Rome because that was where Peccei had his office. After his death in March 1984, King took over asPresident, and the office was transferred to Paris, where King then lived (he now lives in retirement inLondon).[88]​ Dr. Suter, who lives in Australia, one of the most oppressed countries on the Earth since the beginning of the“plandemic,” has just confirmed the incredible hate these people have for Christianity, and for other faiths, as Dr.Suter, adds later in the same article that, “People of all religious views and none simply did not want to beconfronted by the challenges identified by The Club.” And those challenges are, of course, the same globalistrubbish we have now pushed by the World Economic Forum.​ In 1991, the President Emeritus of The Club of Rome Alexander King, and Secretary-General BertrandSchneider reviewed a new book/report called The First Global Revolution: A Report by the Council of The Club ofRome, the global problems outlined 20 years before, in The Limits to Growth, offering both a further warning andadvancing an even more draconian approach to a possible solution by the elite to the supposed world problems.Stating without any sense of shame, that humanity’s “real enemy” is “itself”, not the elite that rules them like cattle,the ultra-wealthy parasites living on private islands, luxurious homes, and fancy estates, polluting along the waywith their private jets and helicopters and generally enjoying life, while we the new “peasants” and “slaves” are allin lockdown for one reason or the other, as climate change lockdowns are the next big thing they are ushering in.The book in question, published 30 years ago, finally admits that their climate agenda is simply driven by their needfor a new enemy:In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of globalwarming, water shortages, famine, and the like would fit the bill ... All these dangers are caused by humanintervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy,then, is humanity itself.[89]​ Topics covered by the book written by Alexander King and Bertrand Schneider, include the need for theworld, to convert from a military to a civil economy. Now that means, for obvious reasons, no more sovereignty, orborders in the New World Order. The report by King and Schneider also talks about the recognition of the disastrousshort-term effects of exploitation by First World countries of Third World poverty, something that has changed inthe last three decades in the exploitation of the rest of the world by some former Third World countries, like Chinain particular (or even Russia or India), that now feel free to act as they wish, without the limitations imposed on the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"rest of us by the farse of useless initiatives like COP 26 and in the meantime China offers to the Third World, asuccessful Marxist model that enables them to challenge in the process Western capitalism on behalf of the Jesuit-led New World Order. But of course, one of the main subjects of The First Global Revolution: A Report by theCouncil of The Club of Rome, is the containment of global warming and the need to reduce global emissions ofcarbon dioxide. As you can see, the Club of Rome is the one’s inspiring the perverse and twisted ideology of theWorld Economic Forum, and the rest of the New World Order.​ For this reason, back in the early 70s, Klaus Schwab became convinced that to bring into fruition the“revolutionary” ideas of the Club of Rome, he needed to put together all the main European CEOs and U.S. businessexperts to discuss new innovative management approaches and techniques to make this happen. The forum wouldalso promote interaction between corporate management and stakeholders. He set up a three-person office in Genevato carry out those plans,[90] and in January 1971, at his financial account and risk, and after various efforts to raisefunding, Klaus Schwab finally organized, in the luxurious Swiss alpine ski resort of Davos, the first EuropeanManagement Symposium (January 24- February 7, 1971), the predecessor to the what will be later called the WorldEconomic Forum. He did all this under the directives of the British Pilgrims Society[91], and to an even larger extent,the Society of Jesus, the infamous Jesuits.For this very reason, Klaus Schwab chose to deliver the keynote speech at the opening session of this historicalevent, none other than Illuminati Kingpin and Jesuit agent, Otto von Habsburg (1912-2011), head of the House ofHabsburg-Lorraine, and sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece (historically linked to Adam Weishaupt’sOrder of the Illuminati), who was the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary from 1916 until the dissolution of theempire in April 1919. The late Otto von Habsburg was also co-founder of the Pan-European Union (PEU), headedby Freemason Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, the infamous Austrian politician and philosopher who pioneered thisfake European integration, as the secret head of a synarchist group whose aim was to create a united Europe. Thecreation of a united Europe was central to the vision of Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, the founder of synarchism, a call forwhich appears on the first page of his first book on synarchy, Keys to the East.[92]​The Distinguished Order of the Golden Fleece is a Catholic order of chivalry founded in Bruges by Philip theGood, Duke of Burgundy, in 1430, to celebrate his marriage to Isabella of Portugal. Today, two branches of theorder exist, namely the Spanish and the Austrian Fleece; the current grandmasters are Felipe VI, King of Spain, andKarl von Habsburg, current head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, respectively[93]. The Grand Chaplain of theAustrian branch of the Order of the Golden Fleece is today a friend of the late Otto von Habsburg, the powerfulCardinal Christoph Schönborn, Archbishop of Vienna, Illuminati, and Freemason[94], who is part of the princelyHouse of Schönborn, whose members before 1918 bore the title of Count and the style of Illustrious Highness.Schönborn is also an Honorary Member of the Teutonic Knights, an Order traditionally headed by members of theHabsburg dynasty.[95]​ From all these details, we understand that right from the start, Klaus Schwab’s globalist project was deeplyinvolved with the Vatican, through the still influential Order of the Golden Fleece, and the Teutonic Knights, inwhich the term “Teutonic” echoes from the German origins of the order (Theutonicorum), and its formal Latin nameOrdo Domus Sanctae Mariae Theutonicorum Hierosolymitanorum. The Teutonic Knights are also featured amongstthe cast of characters of the 27th degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite[96].During World War II, Nazi propaganda and ideology made frequent use of the Teutonic Knights' imagery, as theNazis sought to depict the Knights' actions as a forerunner of the Nazi conquests for Lebensraum.[97]​ Heinrich Himmler tried to idealize the SS as a 20th-century incarnation of the medieval knights. The modernOrder, however, was banned in the Third Reich in 1938 (the year of Klaus Schwab’s birth), due to the long-standingbelief of both Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler that Catholic military-religious orders were untrustworthy andpolitically suspect as subordinates of the Vatican, and representatives of its policy.[98] But the decision to ban theOrder in Germany, in an attempt, to sever all possible ties between the German and Austrian elite with the Vatican,on the eve of what will become a year later, the Second World War, was not enough to stop the perversive control ofthe Vatican Illuminati and would bring upon Hitler and Himmler, the wrath of the Jesuits, and the successivebetrayal of some of their most trusted men, that will ultimately result with both their deaths.​ However, Schwab’s hometown—Ravensburg, Germany—was a very peculiar city during the Nazi era. Itwas, for example, the first German city to practice eugenics (killing in Nazi terms “useless eaters”), and Ravensburgwas also a transport hub for stolen Nazi gold to the Swiss Bank for International Settlements, a criminal enterpriseallegedly run by Pilgrims Society spies Allan W. Dulles (later C.I.A. director, 1953-61), Edwin W. Pauley (Alliedreparations) and William J. Donovan, director of the OSS (precursor to the C.I.A.— and one time Dulles’ boss),and in this context, Klaus Schwab’s father Eugen involvement with the Nazi establishment, and the allegations thatI’m about to share, are, in fact, rather revealing about Klaus family’s lack of morals and their links to Hitler’s evil"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"legacy.In the pre-war years of the 1930s leading up to the German annexation of Poland,Ravensburg’s Escher-Wyss factory, managed directly by Klaus Schwab’s father, Eugen Schwab, continued to bethe biggest employer in Ravensburg, and not only was the factory a major employer in the town, but Hitler’s ownNazi party awarded the Escher-Wyss Ravensburg branch the title of “National Socialist Model Company” whileSchwab was at the helm. The Nazis were potentially wooing the Swiss company for cooperation in the coming war,and their advances were eventually reciprocated. Ravensburg was an anomaly in wartime Germany, as it was nevertargeted by any Allied airstrikes. [99] The presence of the Red Cross, and a rumored agreement with various companies includingEscher-Wyss, saw the allied forces publicly agree to not target the Southern German town. It was not classified as asignificant military target throughout the war, and for that reason, the town still maintains many of its originalfeatures. However, much darker things were afoot in Ravensburg once the war began. Eugen Schwab continued tomanage the “National Socialist Model Company” for Escher-Wyss, and the Swiss company would aid the NaziWermacht to produce significant weapons of war as well as more basic armaments. The Escher-Wyss company wasa leader in large turbine technology for hydroelectric dams and power plants, but they also manufactured parts forGerman fighter planes. They were also intimately involved in much more sinister projects happening behind thescenes which, if completed, could have changed the outcome of World War II. [100]​ Western military intelligence was already aware of Escher-Wyss’ complicity and collaboration with theNazis. As Johnny Vedmore points out, there are records available from western military intelligence at the time,specifically Record Group 226 (RG 226) from the data compiled by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), whichshows the Allied forces were aware of some of the Escher-Wyss’ business dealings with the Nazis. Within RG 226,there are three specific mentions of Escher-Wyss including:​File number 47178 reads, Escher-Wyss of Switzerland is working on a large order for Germany. Flame-throwers are despatched from Switzerland under the name Brennstoffbehaelter. Dated Sept. 1944.File number 41589 showed that the Swiss were allowing German exports to be stored in their country, asupposedly neutral nation during World War II. The entry reads, Business relations between Empresa NacionalCalvo Sotelo (EN CASO), Escher Wyss, and Mineral Celbau Gesellschaft. 1 p. July 1944; see also L 42627Report on collaboration between the Spanish Empresa Nacional Calvo Sotelo and the German RheinmetallBorsig, on German exports stored in Switzerland. 1 p. August 1944.File number 72654 claimed that: Hungary’s bauxite was formerly sent to Germany and Switzerland forrefining. Then a government syndicate built an aluminum plant at Dunaalmas on the borders of Hungary.Electric power was provided; Hungary contributed coal mines, and equipment was ordered from the Swiss firmEscher-Wyss. Production began in 1941. 2 pp. May 1944.[101]​ Yet, Escher-Wyss was left untouched during the war, mainly because they were leaders in one field inparticular which was considered of great importance at the time by the U.S. military–industrial complex, the creationof new turbine technology, which was considered essential in the making of the future nuclear bomb. This is a keyasset that made the Klaus family fortune. The company had engineered a 14,500 HP turbine for the Norsk Hydroindustrial facility’s strategically important hydroelectric plant at Vemork, near Rjukan in Norway. The Norsk Hydroplant, partly powered by Escher Wyss, was the only industrial plant under Nazi control capable of producing heavywater in the early 40s, an ingredient essential for making plutonium for the Nazi atomic bomb program.​ The Germans had put all possible resources behind the production of heavy water in that period, but the Alliedforces were aware of the potentially game-changing tech advances by the increasingly desperate Nazis[102], andfortunately stopped them.From this point onwards I will trace, thanks to Johnny Vedmore ‘s short essay, and the comments made on it byDr. Joseph P. Farrell, how some of Escher-Wyss’s hydro-turbine technology even made it into the Nazi atom bombproject, via the Norwegian heavy water production in Norway, that later helped the construction of various nucleararsenals in countries like Israel as well as South Africa. Despite its small size, Norway, which still delivers theNobel Peace Prize, has, unfortunately, made a large contribution to the spread of nuclear weapons–essentially byselling and producing heavy water.[103]While Nazis knew of the possibility of plutonium, they also knew that its production couldonly be accomplished in a reactor and that it would be a long and difficult project. For this reason, the Nazis seem tohave concentrated like some researchers like Dr. Joseph P. Farrell also point out, on the faster and less complicatedproject of uranium isotope separation, and the enrichment of a uranium-fueled bomb. But in either case, heavy water"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"could be used both as a neutron moderator in a reactor and more importantly, as a source of deuterium fuel for a“boosted fission” bomb[104]. The project, fortunately, failed, thanks to the Allied-led efforts involving both Alliedbombing raids and Norwegian commandos, that lead to Operation Gunnerside and the now legendary Norwegianheavy water sabotage.​ The main hero of Operation Gunnerside was Joachim Roenneberg, who died of old age 99 years old inOctober 2018[105], a distinguished old gentleman I had the honor to meet during a conference many years ago inOslo, who, while serving behind enemy lines in his native Norway during the German occupation, in 1943, blew upthe plant producing heavy water, or D2O, the hydrogen-rich substance which was key to the later development ofatomic bombs, but Klaus Schwab’s father’s ties to the Nazi’s, did not stop the failed Nazi atom-bomb project. Theyare also connected to another infamous Nazi practice.Back in the Escher-Wyss factory in Ravensburg, Eugen Schwab had been busy during thoseyears putting forced laborers to work at his model Nazi company. During the years of World War II, nearly 3,600forced laborers worked in Ravensburg, including at Escher Wyss. According to the city archivist in Ravensburg,Andrea Schmuder, the Escher-Wyss machine factory in Ravensburg employed between 198 and 203 civil workersand POWs during the war. Karl Schweizer, a local Lindau historian, states that Escher-Wyss maintained a smallspecial camp for forced laborers on the factory premises.The use of masses of forced laborers in Ravensburg made it necessary to set up one of the largest recorded Naziforced labor camps in the workshop of a former carpenter at Ziegelstrasse 16. At one time, the camp in questionaccommodated 125 French prisoners of war who were later redistributed to other camps in 1942. The Frenchworkers were replaced by 150 Russian prisoners of war who, it was rumored, were treated the worst out of all thePOWs. Cheap labor was even cheaper back then for these criminals.One such prisoner was Zina Jakuschewa, whose work card and work diary, are still held bythe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Those documents identify her as a non-Jewish forced laborerassigned to Ravensburg, Germany, during 1943 and 1944. [106]All this, of course, does not implicate Klaus Schwab in any of these evil practices, nor does itimplicate him in any way of having sympathy for them, nor for the infamous ideology behind it, as Klaus was onlyan “innocent child” at the time, and his father was the one in charge of the company back then, not him, however,Klaus himself, in the interview I cited earlier with Carlye Adler, said: “I was born in 1938 in Germany, but I wasvery fortunate. My father was the managing director of a Swiss machinery company, and during the war, I spenttime in Switzerland.”[107]​ Young Klaus was indeed very “fortunate” to have the possibility of going to Switzerland, especially while hisfather was forcing laborers to work at his model Nazi company in Ravensburg. However, he must have known, evenat that tender age that his father was working closely with the Nazi’s, maybe, I say maybe, Klaus Schwab just didn’tknow how his illustrious father was taking advantage of the poor POWs to make Escher-Wyss grow even moreproductive during the war effort, to help the Nazi’s produce their first atomic bomb, that fortunately never happened.​ Why does Klaus hide all this? Well, a few years later, Klaus Schwab, will become a close collaborator, anddisciple, of none other than Henry Kissinger, who was once a Jewish refugee. Somebody who fled Nazi Germanywith his family in 1938, the very year Klaus was born in his very “fortunate” background, that will one day lead himto become involved with the rise of the Fourth Reich. Dr. Joseph P. Farrell points out that his family backgroundshould raise a yellow flag of caution, and perhaps should provide a more sinister context, in which to view his ownstatement, “You will not own property und you vill be happy!” A sentence you should read not only with atypical German accent but also in a very “Nazi authoritarian style.”Of course, Schwab’s way of talking reminiscent of a typical Nazi, plus the fact that Schwab seems to havepursued academic studies of mechanical engineering to the macroeconomics of credit and export, might indicate atleast some filial interest in his father’s wartime experiences, since, after his studies and a stint in the U.S.A. atHarvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, he went to work for his father’s old company.​ In the meantime, the atom bomb connection would continue at Escher-Wyss (now Sulzer-Escher-Wyss), alsoafter the war, as it became involved in South Africa’s effort to acquire the bomb, as well as helping Israel in their“Secret Nuclear Project”. Escher-Wyss had been involved with manufacturing and installing nucleartechnology at least as early as 1962, as shown by a patent for a “heat exchange arrangement for a nuclear powerplant”[108], and another patent from 1966 for a “nuclear reactor gas-turbine plant with emergency cooling.”[109] After Schwab left Sulzer Escher-Wyss, Sulzer would also help to develop special turbocompressors for uraniumenrichment to yield reactor fuels. When Klaus Schwab joined Sulzer Escher-Wyss in 1967 and started thereorganization of the company to be a technology corporation, the involvement of Sulzer Escher-Wyss in the darkeraspects of the global nuclear arms race became immediately more pronounced. Before Klaus became involved,Escher-Wyss had often concentrated on helping design and build parts for civilian uses of nuclear technology, for"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"example, nuclear power generation. Yet, with the arrival of the eager Mr. Schwab also came the company’sparticipation in the illegal proliferation of nuclear weapons technology.[110] By 1969, the incorporation of EscherWyss into Sulzer was fully completed, and they would be rebranded into Sulzer AG, dropping the historic nameEscher-Wyss from their name. It was eventually revealed, thanks to a review and report carried out by the Swissauthorities and a man named Peter Hug, that Sulzer Escher-Wyss began secretly procuring and building key partsfor nuclear weapons during the 1960s while Klaus Schwab was on the board, playing a critical key role also in thedevelopment of South Africa’s illegal nuclear weapons program during the darkest years of the apartheid regime.Klaus Schwab is considered a leading figure in the founding of a company culture that helped Pretoria build sixnuclear weapons and partially assemble a seventh. (Boldface emphasis added) This now ratchets up the suspicionmeter considerably, when placed into the context of what else is known about the South African project. In 1973,The New York Times book division published a book by Barbara Rogers and Zdenek Cervenka titled The NuclearAxis: The Secret Collaboration between West Germany and South Africa, in a title which says it all... almost. In it,the authors detail how a Luftwaffe general in the Bundeswehr, a holdover from World War II, and several Germanfirms including Degussa (which was also involved in the wartime Nazi atom bomb effort), were involved in aidingSouth Africa to acquire the atom bomb, which in the opinion of many (including this author) it did. The arrangementwas a “tidy” one. In exchange for South African uranium, Germany would supply the technology to enrich it and theengineering to turn it into a bomb. South Africa became the front behind which postwar Germany acquired nuclearweapons technology, for the South African bomb was in effect a German one...... and an Israeli one, because thethird partner in this picture was, of course, Israel, lending technical assistance as well in return for a steady supply ofuranium from the project. The arrangement was a rather nifty one, given that all three states were in some measureand for very different reasons each a pariah state, and each viewed its national security as being jeopardized withoutnuclear weapons. However, with the arrival of Schwab himself on the scene, aka the infamous Dr. Ernst StavroBlohfeld of SPECTRE, in the middle of that West German-South African atom bomb effort, their efforts werefacilitated and the implications here are inescapable, and terrorizing to some extent., and Johnny Vedmore, doesn’tshrink from mentioning them:​In January, Klaus Schwab announced that 2021 is the year that the World Economic Forum and its alliesmust “rebuild trust” with the masses. However, if Schwab continues to hide his history and that of his father’sconnections to the “National Socialist Model Company” that was Escher-Wyss during the 1930s and 1940s,then people will have good reason to distrust the underlying motivations of his overreaching, undemocraticGreat Reset agenda.In the case of Klaus Schwab himself, it appears that he has helped to launder relics of the Nazi-era, i.e. itsnuclear ambitions and its population control ambitions, to ensure the continuity of a deeper agenda. Whileserving in a leadership capacity at Sulzer Escher Wyss, the company sought to aid the nuclear ambitions of theSouth African regime, then the most Nazi adjacent government in the world, preserving Escher Wyss’ ownNazi-era legacy. Then, through the World Economic Forum, Schwab has helped to rehabilitate eugenics-influenced population control policies during the post-World War II era, a time when the revelations of Naziatrocities quickly brought the pseudo-science into great disrepute. Is there any reason to believe that KlausSchwab, as he exists today, has changed in any way? Or is he still the public face of a decades-long effort toensure the survival of a very old agenda?The last question that should be asked about the real motivations behind the actions of Herr Schwab,maybe the most important for the future of humanity: Is Klaus Schwab trying to create the Fourth IndustrialRevolution, or is he trying to create the Fourth Reich? [111]​ The answer is that Mr. Schwab and his allies, are trying to create the Fourth Reich, a subject I will alsodiscuss later, and I agree with many of Johnny Vedmore statements, as well as interesting reflections, given later ina commentary to his article, by Dr. Joseph P. Farrell. The latter also reflects on how Mr. Schwab’s project is theresult of a sort of post-war “Nazi International,” describing how Schwab works for an invisible “extra-territorialstate,” that for Dr. Farrel is:​ ... hiding behind a complex tapestry of corporations, funds, foundations, think tanks, hiding under abewildering labyrinth of interconnections, all still firmly in the grasp of a hideous ideology.[112]​ I still think the final analysis, made by these two gentlemen, who have otherwise done an excellent job intheir historical findings, is however far too simplistic, and needs to be redefined, and read, in the light of therevelations, that I continue to plug in all my books, that show a much more complex and secretive reality at work"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"behind the New World Order, and now the so-called “Great Reset.” It is a reality that shows, how behind the para-Masonic nature of think thanks, like the World Economic Forum, and their inspirators, the infamous Club of Rome,there is also an occult agenda and a series of Secret Societies from the Illuminati Network, and the elite ofFreemasonry, constantly at work pulling the strings behind the scenes for the Sabbatean Frankist and the Jesuits.Of course, I’m not talking about your average “social Mason,” or “Window Mason,” that youwill find at your local lodge, who are often nice guys who will continue to happily deny the dangers of the NewWorld Order, choosing to ignore the impending dangers of this reality, often in the name of Masonic secrecy.Because after all, the true secrets of Freemasonry, as all Freemasons know very well, are their shared experiences,private thoughts, and deeper understandings between men, that include at times their parallel work in think tanks, orin other secret societies and para-Masonic orders, as well as in the military–industrial complex (MIC), whereFreemasonry always had a relevant role with lodges, specifically with the ones dedicated to the Armed forces.However, many high-level Freemasons these days, choose to play stupid in front of the imminent dangers of theGreat Reset, mainly for their advantage, or to simply keep up their peaceful existence, knowing all too well thatexposing such topics will immediately make them a target within their Fraternity.That’s why I eventually decided to not be involved in Freemasonry. But remember thatFreemasons were once essential in the emergence of democratic governance at the national scale, and it should betheir duty to protect our freedom, and not to comply with this growing monstrosity. Confirming the importance ofFreemasonry concerning the making of democracy are two known academics, UCLA history Professor Margaret C.Jacob, and Distinguished Professor of Biology and Anthropology at Binghamton University, David Sloan Wilson,who wrote:​... the Freemasons were originally a guild of architects that morphed into a “speculative society” inEngland during the early 1700s; that the speculative version spread rapidly to the European Continent andAmerica; and that Freemasons were influential in the emergence of the democratic governance at the nationalscale.Anyone would be fascinated by this story, but for me, it was especially captivating because it meshed sowell with cultural Multilevel Selection (cMLS) Theory, my own area of expertise. A central concern of cMLStheory is how cooperative forms of governance can overcome disruptive self-serving behaviors at all scales,from small groups to large nations. All European nations before the 18th century were autocratic, which meansthat they were governed by an elite for their own benefit and not necessarily for the common good. Democraticmovements in Europe and America were a swing away from extractive forms of governance in the direction ofmore inclusive forms of governance, to employ the language of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in theirbook Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty (2012). Viewed from a cMLSperspective, the history of the Freemasons seemed to indicate that (relatively) democratic governance firstoriginated and spread at a small scale—the Masonic lodges—and then expanded in scale through thedemocratic revolutions. The word “relatively” is important because the Masonic lodges were by no meanstotally inclusive and were famously hierarchical in their own way—but then, the first democratic governmentsweren’t totally inclusive either.[113]For this reason, we need to admit the relevance that Freemasonry had in the making of our democracies, andmove away, from what the TIME once described as “Conspiracy thinking” in an otherwise horrible article about thepower of secrecy in Freemasonry:​Conspiracy thinking drove Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco to crush the Craft. Today, Freemasonry is bannedin China, and everywhere in the Muslim world except Lebanon and Morocco. The Charter of Hamas describesFreemasonry as a “network of spies” created by the Jews to “destroy societies and promote the Zionistcause.”[114]​ Now the truth is that Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco, all used Freemasonry, and the various Illuminati orders, toachieve their initial goals in establishing themselves as dictators, and later started their persecution, towardsFreemasonry and other secret societies, only when they didn’t need them any longer. Who says, they will not do thesame this time, with their Great Reset, and their plan to transform us into a virtual prison planet.Regarding the banning of Freemasonry in China, the truth is that the Chinese have their own formof Freemasonry, that I have discussed in detail in Volume 2, and they don’t even bother in working within the frameof so-called “Masonic Regularity,” with their 6 million members operating all over the world. And everywhere in"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the Muslim world, the most influential figures are members of the Freemasons, and some are in the Illuminati, evenif they publically condemn it, including the hypocrites of Hamas which was created by Freemasons. For this reason,we are all, unfortunately, proceeding towards the Great Reset, and the imminent Fourth Industrial Revolution (4-IR) aka the Fourth Reich, regardless of its devastating implications.According to Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chair of the World Economic Forum(WEF), the 4-IR follows the first, second, and third Industrial Revolutions—the mechanical, electrical, and digital,respectively.[115] The 4-IR builds on the digital revolution, but Schwab sees the 4-IR as an exponential takeoff andconvergence of existing and emerging fields, including Big Data; artificial intelligence; machine learning; quantumcomputing; genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics. The consequence is the merging of the physical, digital, andbiological worlds. The blurring of these categories ultimately challenges the very ontologies by which weunderstand ourselves and the world, including “what it means to be human.”[116] Michael Rectenwald from theLudwig von Mises Institute for Austrian Economics, or Mises Institute, a libertarian nonprofit think tank located inAuburn, Alabama, seem to address this problem, and the possibility of creating a ”virtual prison ” I outlined above:​But if existing 4-IR developments are any indication of the future, then Schwab’s enthusiasm is misplaced,and the 4-IR is misrepresented. These developments already include internet algorithms that feed usersprescribed news and advertisements and downrank or exclude banned content; algorithms that censor socialmedia content and consign “dangerous” individuals and organizations to digital gulags; apps that track andtrace COVID suspects and report violators to the police; robot police with QR code scanners to identify andround up dissenters; and smart cities where everyone is a digital entity to be monitored, surveilled, andrecorded, while data on their every move is collected, collated, stored, and attached to a digital identity andsocial credit score.That is, 4-IR technologies subject human beings to technology management that makes the earliersurveillance by the National Security Agency look like child’s play. Schwab lauds future developments that willconnect brains directly to the cloud, enabling the “data mining” of thought and memory, a technologicalmastery over an experience that threatens individual autonomy and undermines any semblance of free will. The4-IR accelerates the merging of humans and machines, resulting in a world in which all information, includinggenetic information, is shared and every action, thought, and unconscious motivation is known, predicted, andpossibly even precluded. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World comes to mind. Yet Schwab touts brain-cloudinterfaces as enhancements, as vast improvements over standard human intelligence, thus lending them anappeal not at all imaginable for soma. Many positive developments may come from the 4-IR, but unless it istaken out of the hands of the corporate-socialist technocrats, it will constitute a virtual prison.[117]​ Yasha Levine’s book Surveillance Valley ”unearths the true history of the internet” that ”was built by thegovernment to spy on citizens, at home and abroad,” puts a very different spin on things, once you truly understandthe real dangers of this demonic system. It’s in this intersection where the corporate state, the militarists state,predatory philanthropy, and their so-called think thanks, operate together in this digital space on behalf of the NewWorld Order, we find good things but also many risks that ordinary people will never be aware of and tend todismiss as ”Conspiracy Theories.” In Surveillance Valley, Levine traces the history of the internet back to itsbeginnings as a Vietnam-era tool for spying on guerrilla fighters and antiwar protesters–a military computernetworking project that ultimately envisioned the creation of a global system of surveillance and prediction. Levineshows how the same military objectives that drove the development of early internet technology are still at the heartof Silicon Valley today. Spies, counterinsurgency campaigns, hippie entrepreneurs, privacy apps funded by the CIA.[118]​ Now let’s move further into the discovery, and study, of the roots of this problem, and the recent sociallibtard pandemic, that is increasingly frustrating and upsetting people who still have a conscience and a genuinebelief in God and would like to preserve what is left of humanity and traditional values. What I define as theupcoming Great Reject originates from the “populist” uprising of the last few years. For many today, the word“populism” calls to mind a right-wing scourge of sorts, born out of Trumpism, but that’s not true.Yasmeen Serhan wrote for The Atlantic, in March 2020 right at the start of the pandemic:One spring weekend, dozens of academics from around the world gathered at the London School ofEconomics with an ambitious goal: to define populism. None were under any illusions about how difficult thischallenge would be. “The term continues to be used in many different ways,” one participant observed, notingits association with issues as disparate as McCarthyism in the United States and Maoism in China. In the end,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"they failed to settle on a single definition, concluding that “there can, at present, be no doubt about theimportance of populism. But no one is clear what it is.”​ The left mercenaries of the New World Order, after using the word in a derogatory way for years, finallyrealized they were failing in 2018, when libtard darling and best-selling author, David McKnight, published the bookPopulism Now! The Case for Progressive Populism, stating “Populism” isn't a dirty word and it's time for the left toreclaim it. Well, is too late “darling,” the left, has finally revealed to most people around the world in the last fewyears their true submissive globalist nature, and there is no way you will ever be taken seriously with suchpropaganda when most of your leaders bow down to the New World Order and have lost any credibility with thecommon folk. Remember, as “Jesuit” Wikipedia states,Populism refers to a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of \"the people\" and often juxtaposethis group against \"the elite.\" The term developed in the late 19th century in connection to the Populist Partyand has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, often derisively byopponents. Within political science and other social sciences, several different definitions of populism havebeen employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.[119]When you realize that there is no leftist party in the world today, that is not entirelycompromised by the Illuminati Jesuit Sabbatean-Frankist Masonic elite, then you understand the need for “somescholars,” to reject the term altogether. Well, my dear eliterian scumbags, we reject you and your fake promises of a“Build Back Better World.” [120] The answer to all our problems is the Great Reject of this new increasinglyOrwellian reality.

Well, where California goes today, the rest of the United States, and much of the Western world, will gotomorrow, that’s why I decided to move here at the center of the worldwide libtard pandemic to possibly find avaccine for the ever-so-present Leftism Derangement Syndrome (LDS). Because what we are now seeing today inAmerica’s most populous state is the complete internal collapse of the entire liberal progressive civilization, and thesociety that has most frantically tried to fulfill it. Is a bit like wanting to understand the Wuhan virus: if you want tograsp the truth behind its origins, you need to go to where it was born, and investigate it until you find the answers toyour questions.​ For well over a hundred years, California, the self-styled “Golden State” has trail-blazed the future ofAmerica, especially through the two famously American industries of aerospace and motion pictures.Telecommunications, Computers, and Artificial Intelligence are now led from Silicon Valley, and the state hasdominated the national politics of the United States too. California rapidly grew into the wealthiest, largest, andmost populated U.S. state. It has produced two two-term presidents (Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan), one of themost important Chief Justices of the Supreme Court (Earl Warren), and the likely next president, being the currentVice President Kamala Harris if Joe Biden cannot complete his term in office because of his increasingly precarioushealth conditions.From 1928 to 2004, 14 out of 19 winning presidential election tickets, included someone fromeither California, or Texas, and Biden’s choice of Harris put California back at the heart of national electoralpolitics, while, unfortunately, the local GOP, seems corrupt and far away from the real conservative ideals theyshould represent. Just think of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s leftist approach, hanging out with Greta Thunberg andsaying everything you expect from a Democrat. For this reason, California, remains politically, a rock-solid liberalterritory. It has not elected a single Republican to national or statewide office, since reelecting incumbent GovernorArnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. In 2016, then-Governor Jerry Brown notoriously handed out state accreditationand driving licenses to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, secure in the knowledge, that the same peoplewould one day all vote Democrat. Registered Democrats now hold a 46 percent to 24 percent advantage overregistered Republicans statewide, and the system seems rigged beyond any possibility of bringing back aconservative political view. The progressive state of California also holds a cast-iron grip on the nationalDemocratic leadership in Congress through House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her key allies, such as CongressmanAdam Schiff, whose farcical bungles in the two impeachments of former President Donald Trump did not dent hisimmutable position as one of Pelosi’s most youthful favored sons (he is merely 61). Yet now, California is interminal collapse and crisis."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"​ Governor Gavin Newsom, farcically promoted by the national Mainstream Media (MSM) as a heroic whiteknight in shining armor, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, was exposed even in his own state as acatastrophic bungler, and a complete hypocrite, wining and dining, in the middle of the most stringent andcatastrophic lockdown, carelessly showing to the rest of us he was not respecting his own COVID protocols. In theend, California’s sick and tired citizens even provided over 1.5 million signatures, necessary to pull Newsom intowhat was certainly a chaotic recall election, but unfortunately, which was not enough to remove him from office.The Democrats were still able to resist the recall, showing to the world their superiority in California, a state wherethe Freemasons have become agents of the worst “woke” leftism cult.​ As well all know, California, in the last few years, has had the worst wildfires in its history, and theresponsibility for such problem, was, of course, given to climate change, encouraged by the usual climate agendafanatics that we find in abundance in California. While the truth is, that the almost romantic “Green” environmentalpolicies of the past decades encouraged by the left, scrapped the centuries-old, wise practices of creating firebreaksin forests between clumps of trees that would limit fire outbreaks in hot weather. Far from protecting the trees andwildlife, as the kneejerk “Greens” demanded, the ending of windbreak spaces instead, allowed forest fires to blazeon an unprecedented scale, and at record speed, and on top of this, the highspeed railway, also supported by the“Demoncrats,” seems to have contributed to the problem.​ We also have another problem here in California, millions of us are often left to sweat without any airconditioning, simply because the state electric grid, has become another victim of the ignorant “Green prejudice”falsely masquerading as “science”. It repeatedly collapses, unable to generate, in a country that used to be energyindependent under Trump, the necessary reliable requisite power levels at vital times. In the meantime, Los Angeles,the state’s largest city, and arguably the most populous now in the United States, has become a byword for violentcrime and especially the stronghold for the enormous, ultra-violent, and rapidly growing, MS 13 organization,routinely mislabeled as a mere “gang” in libtard media reports. MS 13 has up to 50,000 members worldwide ofwhom at least 10,000, officially, and probably twice as many according to the private assessments of police officersoperating in L.A.The Trump administration had made remarkable success – unacknowledged in the liberalmedia – in deporting many thousands of such thugs. However, President Joe Biden has ensured with his initialExecutive Orders that the old open border policies of both Democratic Presidents (Bill Clinton and Barack Obama)and Republican ones (both George Bush’s) is being restored so they can flood back in again and again to help shiftthe political landscape to the left.​ San Francisco – America’s “anything goes” city – where the Church of Satan was founded on April 30, 1966,is in even worse shape. Its most famous historically popular and beautiful locations are now swamped withaggressive, unsanitary street people who openly urinate and defecate in the streets. Public services, long superb, arenow appalling, and even the mindless liberal suburban classes who have relentlessly voted for and imposed thesecatastrophic policies over the past 40 plus years are now fleeing California as property values crash and taxesbecome too crushing even for them. If California continues to trail-blaze the future for the rest of the United States,then that future is now clear, it is a high taxation society with a huge, impoverished, unemployed, and unemployabledestitute class, where the middle class is annihilated, organized gangs, and general chaotic street crime, includingmuggings, rapes, and murders, metastasize in all major urban areas, and gangs more numerous and heavily armedthan the police operate openly with impunity, with cities like Los Angeles looking more and more like JohnCarpenter's Escape from L.A, the 1996 American post-apocalyptic action film.[122] It is a society, where unlimitedabortion on demand, to and even beyond, the point of birth, is acclaimed as a “moral” imperative, supposedlysuperior to all the Ten Commandments by Californians like Nancy Pelosi, who is supposed to be a Catholic.It seems, that California and the “Demoncrats” now fulfill Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s nightmare vision described inhis prophetic masterpiece The Possessed (also known in English as The Devils), as the Democrats are all possessedby demons, giving us a clear idea of what unlimited liberalism, inevitably creates, if not stopped in its tracks androlled back.​ For a hundred years, since the infant silent movie industry entranced the entire world, before and during,World War I, California has been at the center of developing modern propaganda tools that now help the rise of anAntichristian society. But if California’s future now has no future – what future can the rest of America lookforward to, after all, California is the ultimate product of the Catholic Church and Jesuitry. So will the rest ofAmerica become the same, now that we have Joe Biden, the second Catholic President in history in charge of theWhite House? After all, we all know he is willing to marry all the progressive experiments made in California, that’swhy Biden placed as Vice President, the incompetent Californian Kamal Harris, who will do anything for the GreatReset, a term popularized initially by a book written in the aftermath of the 2008 global crash, that the WorldEconomic Forum and their guru Klaus Schwab liked so much, that they chose it as the permanent title for its current"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"discussions on how governments and companies, are looking to transform into The New World Order.The Great Reset, the book that inspired Klaus Schwab, was published in 2010 by Richard Florida, an urbanstudies researcher at the University of Toronto who had already established himself as a writer for The Atlantic, andauthor of The Rise of the Creative Class, another work whose title entered the popular vocabulary of the left. Withthree other books, on this new class of workers—young, mobile professionals for whom the fast track was the onlycareer track—and their impact on cities and society, Florida had the cred to be taken seriously, when he forecast aGreat Reset, rather than a Great Wipeout, in the wake of what was defined as ”The Big Short,” the financial crisis of2007–2008 that also inspired a successful movie with the same name from 2015. Study your history, he wrote, andyou’ll see that at least in the United States, there have been two resets already. Before the Depression of the 1930s,there was the Long Depression of 1873, which “began as a banking crisis brought on by insolvent mortgages andcomplex financial instruments (sound familiar?) quickly spread to the entire economy, leading to widespread andprolonged unemployment.”[123]So, for these “great experts” and the Biden administration, we simply need to adaptand reinvent ourselves, giving up all the certainties of our past life and embracing “Wokeism,” their Marxist-inspired ideology. And in one of the “Great Reset Dialogues” held on June 26, 2020, John Kerry, a member of theIlluminati Brotherhood of Death, aka Skull and Bones, and other members of the World Economic Forum, discusshow to rebuild the “social contract” in a post-COVID world, stating that we can’t think the “Reset” will bring us,“back to the ways things were,” because “normal was itself not working.”[124]And ten years after the publication of Florida’s book, in June 2020, Klaus Schwab described the three corecomponents of the Great Reset.​ The first includes creating conditions for a “stakeholder economy,” improving policies and agreements ontaxes, regulations, fiscal policies, and trade to result in \"fairer outcomes.\"​ The second component addresses how the large-scale pandemic spending programs with private investmentsand pension funds could improve on the old system by building one that is more “resilient, equitable, andsustainable” over the long term by “building green urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries toimprove their track record on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics.”​ The third component of a Great Reset agenda is to “harness the innovations of the Fourth IndustrialRevolution” for the public good. After a little more than a decade, Dr. Florida, fueled by the success of his ideas,tells interviewers now enthusiastically, that in post-COVID, “Our cities might become affordable enough for artistsand creatives and middle-class people to move back,” as downtown real estate lose retail stores, and traditionaloffices jacked up prices. Dr. Florida expects that young people in search of careers will still flock to cities, that’s theyoung libtards, usually brainwashed by the mainstream media in doing such things. But besides New York and LosAngeles, he sees Philadelphia, Charlotte, Phoenix, and Portland (both the one in Oregon and the one in Maine), asbeing much more affordable cities, becoming viable career locations for distributed, remote workers, all ready toengage in a brand new life, leveraging this way, the current crisis to reinvent cities and our lives.​ The Great Reset is sadly becoming a reality day after day. In a round-table discussion for Foreign Policy inMay 2020, Robert Muggah of Brazil’s Igarapé Institute calls the pandemic “an opportunity for urban planners andentrepreneurs to build back better.” Kiran Bedi, India’s first female police officer and now lieutenant governor of itsPuducherry territory agree that “working from home will be an option, supported by teleconferencing and cloud-based sharing. Office space will come at a much lower rate.” The executive director of the UN’s Human SettlementProgram, one of the main institutions in charge of this “New World Disorder” declares urban renovation a must:“Without safe shelter and access to basic services, the order to shelter in place has no meaning.”[125]​ The smart sensors are going in, the satellites are going up, but people have been conditioned to unquestionablythink that if it says sustainable, it’s good. They would never know that it’s companies like Exxon behind all this.They don’t dig into where the money is coming from for these so-called innovations, and at the same time, mostpeople are increasingly living in fear, an abased element that has come through this ongoing health crisis happeningfor the past two years. The fear element has made people more and more willing to act in compliance and dowhatever is required from them, in terms of an increasing level of surveillance and restrictions on civil liberties, inthe name of a supposed sense of safety, and an illusion of liberty. Some say it’s hard to fathom how it has gotten thisway so fast.[126]The real pandemic is the compliance of an increasing number of fools blindly accepting all thetechnical innovations proposed by the NWO elite. Now with what is coming, with this planned automation of theearth, all humans, without any distinction of race and creed, fall under that disposable category. We need to revisit"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"our Christianity as we are being pushed into this virtualized, Satanic, militarized video game of behavioralcompliance and improvement, in accordance with these alleged sustainable development goals is a return to, andaffirming of the indigenous insurgence, of children of the earth, of natural reciprocity concerning the earth which iscounter to everything that is coming through this technocratic industrially engineered simulated world that is beingput out by those in power, with the help of young useful idiots like Greta Thunberg, another aspiring Antichristianfigure.​ In the physical space, the goal is these interoperable identities, self-sovereign identities are what they arecalled, they’re being sold to us as “privacy-protecting,” that we can own our data and that we will be much morevaluable. There’s been a back door that’s been built into blockchain. It’s called the Enigma Protocol that MITdeveloped that allows them to quarry unencrypted data. The futures markets that are coming online, which is thefinance side, Goldman Sachs, UBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, Vatican Bank, SoftBank – for these folks to move theircapital in human futures – because what is being set up now are futures markets in behavior change & that isnecessitated because if we imagine the last global economic crash was related to housing, that they created thesesynthetic debt obligations to channel global capital & as that fell apart in the decade following, the wealth has onlycontinued to become more concentrated.[127]​ Like batteries in the Matrix, the poor are meant to be the fuel of this sick game, both at a spiritual level andmaterialistic level that will eventually transform us into prisoners of this upcoming Metaverse. The ArtificialIntelligence structure behind the birth of Cyber Satan does not care for the actual wellbeing of humanity, its solepurpose is to maximize profit and control us. In that way, it is similar to the present Western medical model, whereBig Pharma always opts for chronic disease management over research leading to real cures that will help people.It’s a diabolical world we currently live in, that’s for sure. Invest to empower the poor is not a good idea for the elitebut instead managing them and harvesting their data, indefinitely,[128] will be for the Illuminati and their Jesuitsupervisors, a gold mine that never ends, and the infrastructure for this system was put in place in the years leadingup to the financial crisis of 2008. After toxic mortgages imploded, financiers needed another way to keep globalcapital circulating until the next financial bubble explodes. The new Macchivellian idea of the elite needed to beeven bigger than real estate debt since global wealth continues to become more and more concentrated into a smallgroup of soulless technocrats working for Cyber Satan. The next big target would be financialized public benefitssystems. Through financialization, resources are siphoned from the real economy into the financial sector wheredemands for short-term profit lead to instability, overwhelming debt, income inequality, and wage stagnation.[129]Allingredients that will bring us, in the long run, to inevitably own nothing, and supposedly beg for the “happiness”proposed by Dr. Evil, aka Professor Klaus Schwab.A Vaccine Loving Marxist Pope and the Capitol Riot Trap At the very beginning of 2020, while Pope Francis was greeting pilgrims in St. Peters Square on New Year's Evein front of the Vatican Nativity scene, an alleged Chinese dissident from the Chinese “Underground” CatholicChurch, shouted to the Pope “Why destroy the faith?” Immediately afterward, a careless Pope started slapping her inpublic. Most of you have probably seen the video of this unusual altercation, possibly thinking what the hell wasgoing on in St. Peters Square that evening. Well, this unusual encounter is very symbolic, to say the least, as ithappened right at the start of the year that brought us the China virus.​ The mysterious Chinese Catholic woman that was never identified, took hold of Pope Francis’ hand in adesperate plea for the Chinese Catholics who are not accepting the CCP destruction of their Faith, after the infamousdeal made in 2018 between the Vatican, and Communist China. But of course, the Unholy Father, who gets a lot ofmoney from China, since the beginning of his papacy, did not appreciate his hand being yanked by a Chinesedissident and began slapping her hand to free himself from the stranger’s grip. The Catholic world immediately fellinto a tussle, adjudicating this event, and the Pope was eventually forced to apologize during his New Year's Dayaddress to make public amends with his Faithful. It was, as we all know, only the start of a crazy year, and peopleare now left wondering, what will the future look like for humanity, two years later.​ As most of you already know, over 465 years ago, a French astrologer and philosopher, Michel deNostradamus made predictions about the future of humanity in his now legendary book Les Propheties. Shockinglyenough, a number of these incredible predictions have come true, and for some researchers, Nostradamus evenalluded to aspects of the coronavirus pandemic in his predictions. So, what did Nostradamus predict for the future?Well, he stated that 2020, for example, was a year of “great trouble for humanity,” but greater trouble will manifestitself in the future, and this seems pretty obvious, especially after the tragic end of Donald J. Trump’s presidency,and the aftermath of the Capitol riot, that I would like to rename, “The Great Capitol Trap.”"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"One year later, it is obvious to most of us that we were in front of another inside job, just like9/11, that Klaus Schwab witnessed as he was having breakfast in the Park East Synagogue in NYC with SabbateanFrankist, Rabbi Arthur Schneier, former Vice President for the World Jewish Congress. The Illuminati have createdfor the Left their own “Libtard Christmas,” which will be celebrated for years to come, and the Jesuits and theirleftist mercenaries are behind it.​ In 1936, a young German journalist named Konrad Heidan wrote a book called, Hitler: A Biography, inwhich he described the street fighting between the Communists and Nazis which characterized much of the early1930s Germany. One interesting thing he mentioned about the paramilitary Nazi S.A., known as the Brownshirts orStormtroopers, was:​There were large numbers of Communists and Social Democrats among them; many of the stormtrooperswere called ‘beefsteaks—brown [outside] and red within. Jest was retailed such as the following: one S.A. mansays to another: ‘In our storm troop there are three Nazis, but we shall soon have spewed them out.[130]​ Some historians surmise that a lot of these young men just liked to fight, they didn’t care much who they werefighting, or for what cause, they just wanted the end of the system that brought them to poverty and desperation.While the mainstream media and the federal government drummed up imminent threats of right-wing violenceduring the Presidential inauguration of 2021 at state capitol buildings after the tragic events of the 6th of January,nothing happened that was significant in reporting. Meanwhile, after the Biden inauguration, leftist groups, such asAntifa, were causing increasing chaos in multiple cities and will probably continue for years to come.[131]   In 1930s Germany they were angry at the establishment, and for good reason. Germany was left in horribleshape by WWI and the disastrous monetary policies of the Weimar Republic. The people who felt left behind weregoing to express their rage in anyway they could. When the seat of the German government, the Reichstag Building,was set aflame in 1933, the Nazis accused communist agitators of setting the fire. It’s more than likely, however,that the Nazis themselves burned Reichstag, and then scapegoated the Communists to justify the brutal crackdownthat followed. Before I go further, let me just say that the United States in 2022 is not the same as Germany in 1933.And even if the U.S. is on a similar trajectory, we haven’t even seen the Weimar kind of inflation yet, the kind JoeBiden might usher in with his idiotic policies, which would put us sometime around 1921, before World War I,when one U.S. dollar was worth 4.2 German marks. But the Germans owed massive debts to pay back the othernations for the war. With no way to come up with the money, they simply printed more and more marks. Imaginethat by 1923, a single U.S. dollar was worth 4.2 trillion marks.What is also concerning, is that the civil unrest that the left put together in the last year of theTrump’s era, arrived when we hadn’t even witnessed the start of the widespread economic devastation that theChina virus/biological warfare has truly created around us, thanks to the plan set up by the “illuminated” elite of theNew World Order. Now that this ugly reality made possible in the U.S. and around the world, by senseless rules,never-ending restrictions, shutdowns, and lockdowns, is finally visible to all of us, the growing poverty isincreasingly visible even to skeptics, and to be honest, it is only the start of one of the most difficult periods in thehistory of humanity. People are, of course, angry towards the Biden’s Jesuit administration, and they have goodreason to be angry, whether for a completely corrupt political system, the neverending rubbish by the usual “swamp”creatures in Washington DC, the Afghanistan disaster, growing inflation, and the whopping food crisis and supplyproblems.    People in the United States of America are upset for a variety of reasons these days, including,of course, the U.S. presidential elections of 2020, which seemingly started this crisis, but was only the pretense forwhat has been unfolding ever since. There is also a growing disappointment as a write this, regarding formerPresident Trump, who seems more and more like a double agent these days, especially when he continues to push“his” vaccine nonsense regardless of the consequences they might have. Now, as many of you may know, I’ve beenone of the biggest supporters of Donald J. Trump. I was even the President of Italians4Trump, which I co-foundedin 2015, when Gianmario Ferramonti, who I talk about in Vol. 3, and other influential figures of the Italian politicalscene, helped Trump in his bid for the presidency, with the influential Italian American Community. However,Trump’s words of support for the vaccine booster, in front of Bill O'Reilly, in December 2021, were, unfortunately,too much for me and millions of people around the world. Personally, it felt like the biggest political disappointmentin my entire life, because I truly loved and respected the Trump presidency and his past work. Because of all this,people seem to have lost faith in politics and in democracy not only here in America, but also in the rest of theworld. People feel no agency, or control over their own situation, or their government, but some want to take thatcontrol back in some way."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"In Germany, if the power hadn’t gone to the Nazis, at the time founded by the American Illuminati,it would have probably gone to the Communists, funded by Soviet Russia, which had a much higher death countthan Nazi Germany, of course, before they started their infamous Holocaust.

McKay’s report was based on an old interviewgiven by Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov, to my old friend and author George Edward Griffin (who just turned 90 bythe way), and today the situation is even direr than predicted.​ Scott McKay wrote:​The first goal of revolutionary propaganda, particularly the Marxist variety, is to demoralize. It’s todepress you and make you believe your civilization is lost. Once you succumb to that, you are, in the words ofMing the Merciless, “satisfied with less.” Why do you think ordinary white people are so willing to apologizefor the sins of their ancestors and to confess to being racist without even knowing it? Why do you thinkcorporate America is blindly endorsing a Marxist revolutionary organization that openly declares war on thenuclear family? That’s demoralization, and according to Bezmenov, it’s the first step in engineered societalcollapse.[132]​ Because as Scott McKay points out in the same article:​They’re not even trying to hide this anymore. Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrice Cullors repeatedlysays: “We are trained Marxists.” Antifa’s imagery, dogma, public statements — all straight from the Marxistplaybook. The bleatings of the Democrat Socialist crowd, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, andthe rest — unabashedly Marxist. [133]And if you want to know the role of “Sleepy Biden” in all this, McKay compares him to one of the mostdemented “useful idiots” of the Russian Revolution called Alexander Kerensky:​Joe Biden isn’t Vladimir Lenin. Biden is Alexander Kerensky, the Russian politician who served as thevessel for the revolutionaries to overthrow the old guard in 1917 and then, once he had proven himself usefultoward that end, was shuffled aside so the real power could assume control. And as in Kerensky’s case, whatcomes after will bring the end of all that we know. [134]​ That’s why, most of the mercenaries of the elite who destroyed, and will continue to destroy U.S. Nationalmonuments, now and in the future, will never face 10 years in prison under an executive order that Trump himselfsigned without any visible result when protesters against police brutality were tearing down statues during theturbulent summer of 2020. After all, these thugs and criminals, are considered untouchable, and useful, because theyare tools of the Illuminati-leftist agenda. It seems at this point no meaningful change is coming to Washington DC,even if we could hold a free and fair Presidential election in 2024, because in one way, or the other, the systemseems completely rigged by the globalist agents of the New World Order, in America and abroad. Antifamercenaries and manipulated right-wingers will keep battling in the streets, likely intensifying their quest totransform cities into war zones and living hells. We’ll see more Occupy Seattle CHAZ takeovers, police stations like the precinct inMinneapolis set on fire in the summer of 2020, and more violent protests surrounding government buildings, withnobody lifting a hand to sort things out, because their plan is to push you out of the cities so they can transform theminto so-called “Smart cities,” under the control of Cyber Satan.​ In the meantime, sorry to reiterate the concept, but none of the Antifa and BLM activists that participated inthe trashing of American cities for months will ever be arrested or put on public display, and shamed like thoseAmerican patriots, that, unfortunately, fell into “The Great Capitol Trap” of the 6th of January 2021, ending up aspolitical prisoners, or the Chinese police, parading suspected COVID rule-breakers through the streets of the city ofJingxi at the end of December 2021.[135] Really ask yourself, and be realistic, what would it take for everything tosettle down and go back to normal in this increasingly mad scenario? Remember, this does not end well, for all of usif we don’t find some immediate realistic solutions in the U.S., and in the rest of the world, affected by the evil plans"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"of this ever so aggressive New World Order.Also keep in mind, that the party of the Jesuits currently controls the White House. So highertaxes, never-ending draconian COVID response and vaccine mandates, and more regulations are the sad reality oftoday, but also of the future if we don’t stop them. The left can now use their enormous power to continue to punishtheir political enemies and silence them forever. Whatever truly happened at the storming of Capitol Hill, thatinfamous day of January 2021, will be used for years, not only to shame conservatives, but as an excuse forincreased government surveillance, new policing powers, more weapons regulations, massive controls, andcensorship on free speech. And who knows what else the Jesuit Bolsheviks of today might come up with in thecoming months and years, before the end of this globalist take-over, that they have planned for 2030. At the end ofJanuary 2022, TIME magazine writes about a “new unit” that “is taking shape within the Justice Department: a teamof attorneys exclusively dedicated to investigating domestic terrorism, tightening the focus of the U.S. NationalSecurity apparatus on extremism coming from within the country’s borders, rather than overseas.”[136]At this pointthe FBI, that is already acting on behalf of the Democrats in recent years, will be able to have an extra hand fromthis “new unit.” Who knows what kind of false flag event they will plan to further their evil goals; are they going tokill Joe Biden and blame it on the MAGA movement? Everything seems possible in the Jesuit/Illuminati “TwilightZone” of today, and I’m sorry to be an alarmist but get a solid “Plan B,” ready to survive the coming years, so thatas tensions continue to escalate, you and your family have at least a few options to survive the purge. Because theywill purge all Christians in the end, of their Christian identity, and their soul, but also of their lives and freedoms.

Of course, I will always prefer Trump, or personally De Santis over Biden, but it shouldbe obvious to everybody by now, that 2020 was year zero for the elite's big move towards what they call “TheGreat Reset,” and things will only get worse for humanity, regardless of who is in power in the political realm.Now we are entering the climax of this long-planned crisis, that people like me, Alex Jones, David Icke, and ofcourse, of course, the legendary Jordan Maxwell, the only name you should use for somebody known as the“Godfather of Secret Societies,” who has been warning about this for decades before everybody else and has nowjoined the Great Reject project understanding before others its importance.The U.S. has been gripped more and more in the last few years by professional anarchists,violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and other mercenaries of the left often sponsored by evilfigures like Soros, that are at times tolerated, or even helped in their criminal actions, by certain government figures,and institutions. Meanwhile, the FBI seems incredibly busy working to stop the alleged threats posed by domesticterrorism and hate crimes by the far right, who are often called “White supremacists,” while doing almost nothing tostop the criminal actions of Antifa, or BLM, or even Islamists in some cases.A few months before “The Capitol Hill Trap,” in early September 2020, a draft report madeby the Department of Homeland Security named the so-called “White supremacists”, as “the gravest terror threat tothe United States.” There were two later draft versions of the same document — all of which were reviewed byPOLITICO:​describe the threat from white supremacists in a slightly different language. But all three drafts describe thethreat from white supremacists as the deadliest domestic terror threat facing the U.S., listed above theimmediate danger from foreign terrorist groups.[137]​ In the same article, even the left-leaning publication based in Arlington County admitted that:​None of the drafts POLITICO reviewed referred to a threat from Antifa, the loose cohort of militant left-leaning agitators who senior Trump administration officials have described as domestic terrorists. Two of thedrafts refer to extremists trying to exploit the “social grievances” driving lawful protests. [138]​ On the 17th of September 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray prepared the future demonizing scenario ofthe “evil” Trump supporters, singling the alleged “White supremacists” as “the greatest domestic terrorist” threatever. Wray did this, during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing, and when U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA analyst, asked Wray during the said hearing to discuss the number of investigations into thesupposed, “White supremacist” groups versus groups on the left.Wray vaguely replied that the FBI has roughly 1,000 domestic terrorism investigations a year, though it is a“good bit north of a thousand this year.” In this context, Wray stated that he investigated:"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"​Within the domestic terrorism bucket, the category as a whole, racially motivated violent extremism is, Ithink, the biggest bucket within that larger group. And within the racially motivated violent extremist bucket,people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that.​ And a couple of weeks later, at an NBC town hall in Miami during the Presidential election debates inSeptember 2020, when a woman asked future President Joe Biden what he would do to stop “White supremacist”groups, “Sleepy Joe” promptly replied by saying: “The president's own FBI chief has said the greatest domesticthreat to terrorism are white supremacists,” adding with a false sense of disdain: “And when you have a Presidentsaying to one particular group of white supremacists that, in fact, stand down but stand by, that is like a clarion callto get ready.”​ Biden was referring, of course, to President Donald J. Trump’s debate comments to the Proud Boys, when hesaid during another town hall meeting: “stand back and stand by.” A very unusual statement indeed, as the next dayTrump himself said he didn’t know who the Proud Boys were, and that “they have to stand down, let lawenforcement do their work.” That statement was my first alarm bell during his Presidential campaign, a strangestatement that made me wonder about Trump’s honesty, and the possibility he might be a “chaos magician,” of sorts,working in disguise for the dark side. Because is the very practice of Chaos Magick that suggests to its practitionerssaying “outrageous” things as part of its shock tactic approach to enhancing “personal power.” Chaos magick, alsospelled Chaos magic, is a contemporary magical practice present within certain Illuminati groups, like theIlluminates of Thanateros for example, an international magical organization linked to George Soros in countrieslike Ukraine, that focuses on practical group work in Chaos magick.[139]​ The concept of Chaos magick was initially developed in England in the 1970s, drawing heavily from thephilosophy of Satanic artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) involved with Aleister Crowley and hisA∴A∴ an Illuminati magical organization described in Vol. 1. Well, I have been lucky enough to meet, and knowpersonally, many members of the “infamous” Proud Boys since my arrival in the United States, back in May 2019,and I have even interviewed personally Enrique Tarrio, the now-former chairman of the Proud Boys, with acontroversial past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, for my now-defunct Youtube channel, and Inever saw any “White Supremacists” amongst the members, in this self-described ”Patriotic drinking fraternity,”that to my knowledge, has always respected U.S. laws and the police forces. On top of this, many Proud Boys arealso Latino’s like Tarrio, who simply despise the left because they come from countries like Cuba, or Venezuela,where the evil ideologies of Communism and Socialism, have already destroyed the lives of millions of people. However, the arrest of Enrique Tarrio two days before the Capitol riot, and the fact thatcourt records show Henry “Enrique” Tarrio helped the FBI in the past, was indicative of a possible setup. It is nosurprise that the day before, a small number of Trump supporters, including some Proud Boys and various militiamembers, stormed Congress on the 6th of January 2021, the increasingly leftist FBI ignored the warning issued bytheir own office in Virginia, that had issued an explicit warning that extremists were preparing to travel toWashington to commit violence and “war,” according to an internal document reviewed by The Washington Post.[140] A document that contradicts a senior official’s declaration that the Bureau had no intelligence, indicating anyoneat the events in support of President Trump, planned for the 6th of January 2021 wanted to commit these actions.The FBI and Christopher Wray, the American attorney who is currently still serving as Director of the FBI since2017, willingly ignored the warning, to facilitate what was a trap to destroy the credibility of 75 million voters, whomostly support, to this day, former President Donald J. Trump, who probably did not do enough to prevent thismess, leading to many patriots ruining their lives and ending up in jail. However, Trump recently suggested during arally in Texas at the end of January 2022, that if he is reelected, he would pardon them, but, as usual, severalprominent Republicans from the swamp, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, immediately criticized the move thatwould partly redeem Trump’s faults regarding January 6, 2021."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"FIG. 15 –– Ring with the Sigil of Chaos the symbol of the Illuminates of Thanateros.An X-Files Scenario is Unfolding... At this point, can we still trust the FBI? Not really, as we have seen in so many episodes of the tv series The X-Files, there is always a dark side to the Bureau. That’s why the FBI, never seemed to have liked that show in thefirst place. Evidence of what I’m saying comes from the late Cartha “Deke” DeLoach (1920-2013), once deputyassociate director of the FBI, that worked as an adviser for the fifteenth episode of the fifth season of the famousAmerican science fiction television series, called the “Travelers.”In 2019, a letter obtained by government transparency journalists and researchers at MuckRockcaptured DeLoach's reaction to the “Travelers” script, which was supremely negative. The script was entertainingbut very “sophomorish” DeLoach wrote. “When compared to FBI policies it was totally lacking in accuracy andobjectivity.” Really? “It may appeal to some segments of the masses through attempts at sensationalism, but it's [sic]crudeness and primer-like aspects will turn off anyone with knowledge of the FBI and law enforcement in general.”DeLoach retired from the FBI in 1970, after serving for years as a confidante to FBI director J.Edgar Hoover, and Associate Director Clyde Tolson, and was called as an uncredited consultant, to help with theirdepiction of the Bureau during the days of the Hollywood Blacklist, and the Red Scare depicted in “Travelers,” [141]that follows the events triggered in the thirteenth and fourteenth episode of the fifth season, when after a UFO crashin the ever-so mysterious land of Kazakhstan, Dmitri, a young Kazakh, gets infected by an alien virus known as the“black oil,” revealed to be the “life force” of the alien colonists, which seemingly use it to reproduce their kind, aswell as infect other alien races to conquer the universe. [142]​ In the fifteenth episode Agent Mulder (David Duchovny) visits a retired FBI agent, who describes trackingdown Skur, an alleged Communist who turned out to have been the victim of government experimentation. Nowhost to a parasitical alien entity, which bursts from his mouth to kill anyone who threatens him, “Travelers” suggeststhat 1950s paranoia surrounding Communist infiltrators was part of a cover-up for something even more sinister. So,what is more sinister than Communism? Well, the Jesuits and the Vatican seem to have the answer to this importantquestion, and they are finally unveiling the truth after years of careful, doctrinal discussions, and even Pope Francisweighed in on the “aliens” in the last few years, stating with no shame they would be our brothers and he wouldbaptize them, but that’s ridiculous if the entity in question is a demon.In the meantime, we should also keep in mind in this context, a spin-off movie from the X-Files, sub-headed “Fight the Future,” that was shot in the summer of 1997 flowing out of the season five narrativethat offered us the previously mentioned “Travelers” episode, and then flowing back into season six. The film was a“pre-pandemic” Hollywood Pre-Programming project about the sense that a great disease, or cataclysm, is inevitablyon its way. In the film, Doctor Alvin Kurtzweil played by Martin Landau, a friend to Mulder’s father, William (Bill)Mulder, tells the two were recruited for a project that they were told was biological warfare – specifically, a virus.Kurtzweil huddles with Fox Mulder in an alley, warning him that “a plague to end all plagues” is coming, created bya shadowy cabal “negotiating a planned Armageddon.”With beautifully conveyed urgency, Doctor Kurtzweil describes a pandemic in which the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency (FEMA) will take over the reins of government, this as the alien virus renders us helpless"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"before the extraterrestrial takeover.[143]​ In the State Department, Kurtzweil and Mulder’s father were considered “fellow travelers” (usually a phrasereferring to Communist non-party sympathizers – see the episode “Travelers” – although Kurtzweil may have usedthe term metaphorically to refer to any shared cause) and both became disillusioned, but William Mulder'sdisenchantment outlasted Kurtzweil's similar frustration. On one occasion, Kurtzweil was photographed having apicnic with seven other individuals, including William Mulder, his two children, Fox, and Samantha Mulder, and hiswife, Teena Mulder.[144]More recently, in the 10th season of the show “The X-Files,” which aired in the United Statesin 2016, we have the appearance of the “Spartan virus,” that the fictional aliens of the popular TV series put in thesmallpox vaccine, to later be able to edit our DNA and wreak havoc on our immune systems. The vaccine genomeediting (also called gene editing) that gives scientists the ability to change an organism’s DNA technology wascalled in the “The X-Files” episode CRISPR-Cas9. Now, we can ignore the alien DNA modification hypothesis asnonsense, but the fact that they want to either spread this ongoing biological warfare further or vaccinate all of us, orto hijack our system, is, unfortunately, a sad reality. In May 2021, a team of prominent scientists discussed thecontroversial theory that genetic bits of the pandemic coronavirus can integrate into our chromosomes and stickaround long after the infection is over.[145]A few months earlier, there was another controversial study that claimed that mRNA vaccinescan alter our DNA forever. In a non-peer-reviewed paper published as a pre-print in December 2020[146]. The co-authors, which included two biologists from the respected Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) claimed thatthe novel coronavirus could modify human DNA.​ Going back to the Vatican, a deliberate effort by Church officials to “warm-up” the laity to ET disclosure, isgradually taking place, as I will show you in the next few pages. For this reason, it is no coincidence, that officialchurch publications on the subject in recent years, seems to attempt to soften the blow before the ultimate disclosurearrives, and they seem to be doing this to help the faithful retain their Faith considering unprecedented forthcomingknowledge coming their way after they complete the infamous “Great Reset” upon mankind. Let’s not forget thatwhen former President Donald J. Trump, signed the second coronavirus stimulus bill into law in December 2020, heset off a 180 day’s countdown, requiring U.S. intelligence agencies to report what they know about UFOs, andwhether, or not, they pose a threat. Of course, nothing much came out of it, aside from the final admission thatUFOs are real. It was, unfortunately, another “nothing burger” courtesy of the now-defunct Trump administration.However, President Donald Trump said he has heard some interesting things about Roswell,but he did not share them even with his eldest child. During a Father’s Day-themed interview with his son DonTrump Jr., hosted by the President’s reelection campaign in June 2020, Don Jr. wound down his interview byjokingly asking his father/President if he would ever divulge more information about Roswell, the New Mexico cityknown for its proximity to arguably most famous UFO event — “and let us know what’s really going on.” Trumpresponded, “I won’t talk to you about what I know about it, but it’s very interesting.”[147]In the meantime, operations for controlled exposure led worldwide by the Jesuits are alreadytaking place, as machinations of evil led by the usual demonic entities. But extraterrestrial, or primevally elemental,alien beings, who a lot of researchers, also in the Evangelical community, see as deceptive demonic beings, arepowerless against us if we consider deeply the message of Jesus in the New Testament, that it is a warning, aweapon, and a tool of wisdom, from God the Father, that we always need to rely on in the End times. Alwaysremember we conquer the lurking fear in our own souls, only when we turn to God, that’s the only way to fight thismy dear friends and allies of the Great Reject. As Professor Christopher Partridge, from the Department of Theology and ReligiousStudies at the University College of Chester, in the United Kingdom, writes: “Initially, the sacralization of theextraterrestrial led to an understanding of the alien as a fundamentally benevolent, messianic figure—a‘technological angel’. This was largely because of the Cold War environment in which much UFO religion arose.Those attracted to the myth looked beyond a politically and militarily unstable planet to extraterrestrial saviors.Furthermore, because UFO religions have their roots in the Theosophical tradition, the religious understanding ofthe extraterrestrial tended to be fundamentally indebted to the concept of the wise and benevolent ascendedmaster.”[148] This is a subject that I have already analyzed in-depth in my book, Invisible Master.[149] It is importantto realize how we as Christians, have a different perception of the UFO phenomenon, from New Agers today,mainly because the roots of their “alien” perception comes from Theosophy and Eastern religious traditions, just likethe Illuminati controllers of the imminent Fourth Reich, who, like the Third Reich, despise the myths and symbols ofChristian demonology, that give us real insight on the reality of these beings. But there are also some Christianresearchers that have a different take on this subject like Timothy Alberino, who seem to believe the theories Iexposed above about the alien/demonic connection, might have good “intentions,” and “be admirable” but are"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"“unsupported by logic and unsubstantiated by the facts.”[150] A controversial take on this phenomenon, especiallyfrom Christian researchers like Alberino, who don’t want to associate the abduction phenomena, they seem to thinkis at the center of the UFO mystery, with the Christian phenomena of demonic possession. However, there issomething I totally agree about with my friend, Timothy: “Both fallen and non-fallen angels come from the samecivilization and are members of the same race,” and “the presumption that only the bad guys travel in advancedaerospace vehicles is a logical fallacy.”[151] In fact, like Timothy Alberino cleverly points out,They share the same general appearance, the same heritage, the same language, the same customs, the sameknowledge, and the same technology. Hardware has no allegiance. Technology cannot be “fallen. A flyingsaucer is no more good or evil than your Ford Truck.​ The truth is out there if we want to use once again a known quote by the ever-optimistic Fox Mulder, andformer President Donald J. Trump now knows this truth, because of his time as President of the United States. Couldthis have changed him? Or even ruined his integrity? We can only speculate on this subject, but it a fascinating one.Archbishop “Pope” Carlo Maria Viganò is On Board with The Great RejectOccult researcher and O.T.O. member Gary Lachman wrote in 2018 that the fact “Trump does not take thingstoo seriously, can be gleaned from his many gnomic late-night tweets.[152]” But that’s not always the case, and withone tweet, President Trump introduced Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò to a much wider audience in June 2020,helping one of the few Catholic prelates I respect these days. For Lachman, Trump’s reality “is a kind ofplayground”[153] often linked to his “New Thought” background, and I want to add that it is in this context, formerPresident Trump might have helped at times the good side “making things happen,”[154] others instead, he went (andstill goes on), in the opposite direction, in what seems more and more like the work of an Illuminati “ChaosMagician” because“ like New Thought, Chaos magick is interested in results.”[155] Unfortunately for all of us, suchresults seem focused on “shifting the boundary of achievable reality,” which seems like another way of expressingthe desire to create reality itself. [156] Now, that might not always be a good thing for his political base, even if Iprefer Trumpism to libtard ideology.​ The New Thought movement (also Higher Thought) is a spiritual movement that appeared in the UnitedStates in the early 19th century. Its most famous student was Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science,another religious movement that emerged in the latter half of the 19th century. Eventually, Eddy distanced herselffrom Quimby, focusing her movement on reforming what she saw as the errors within Christianity. However, whatEddy shared with the New Thought movement was a belief that curing illness was connected to the mind’s power torestore health. By the 1890s, the New Thought movement had shifted attention away from curing disease. Instead, itfocused upon the mind’s power to create material success. Historian Beryl Satter observes, “Since human thoughthad creative power, negative thoughts materialized into negative situations, while spiritual thoughts could form apositive reality.” The New Thought’s emphasis on achieving personal prosperity meshed with themes associatedwith the late 19th-century Gilded Age.[157]Regarding the term “New Thought,” Horatio Willis Dresse (1866-1954) a New Thought, religious leader, andauthor in the United States[158] wrote in A History of the New Thought Movement:In England, the term Higher Thought was preferred at first, and this name was chosen for the HigherThought Centre, the first organization of its kind in England. This name did not, however, represent a changein point of view, and the movement in England has been similar to the therapeutic movement elsewhere.[159]​ The fusion between New Thought and Christian libertarianism is epitomized by Norman Vincent Peale(1898-1993) who became Trump’s mentor in “positive thinking,” and was the one who “popularized thephrase.”[160] New Thought was preceded by “ancient thought”, accumulated wisdom and philosophy from a varietyof origins, such as Ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, Taoist, Vedic, Hindu, and Buddhist cultures and their"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"related belief systems, primarily regarding the interaction between thought, belief, consciousness in the humanmind, and the effects of these within and beyond the human mind. Although there have been many leaders andvarious offshoots of the New Thought philosophy, the origins of New Thought have often been traced back toPhineas Quimby, or even as far back as Freemason and Illuminati Franz Mesmer[161] (1734-1815), Mesmerattended the University of Ingolstadt in 1759, the future birthplace of the Illuminati. During the early years of animalmagnetism, the Mesmeric and Masonic movements in France frequently shared membership, philosophicalpositions, ambiance, and ritualistic style. There was even a proposal to establish a blend of the two to be calledMesmeric Masonry, although nothing came of that[162] an attempt was made with the first Société de Harmonie thatwas formed in Paris, but its members seem to have acted in a manner that was anything but “harmonious.” Aftersome quarreling among themselves, they broke their contract with Mesmer, whereby they had promised beforebeing admitted to his lectures that they would not practice on their account or give away the secret of his methodswithout his consent. Other Societies of Harmony soon sprang up, the most important being that of Strasbourg,founded in 1785 by the Marquis Chastenet de Puységur.[163]Trump, wrote on his now-defunct Twitter account, on June 10, 2020, that he was “honored”by an open letter that Viganò himself, the former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. (2011-2016), had written to himdays earlier encouraging his 82 million followers to read it.[164] In the highly controversial open letter, Viganòclaimed among other things that “civil disturbances” in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody, thatwere provoked by “deep state” operatives, because “the virus is inevitably fading” and “the social alarm of thepandemic is waning,” something that, unfortunately, seems still present, as the neverending strategy of the variantsmakes it impossible to ever go back to normality.In his letter, Viganò also claimed that restrictions to stem the pandemic were a “colossaloperation of social engineering.” The letter in question was published June 6, 2020, by LifeSiteNews, a traditionalCatholic website unjustly branded by the mainstream as “right-wing,” based in Canada, known for their traditionalviews on abortion and homosexuality, and as a regular sounding board for the Jesuit pope's critics. In the letter in question, Viganò, 79 at the time, praised Trump and used veiled language about “the children oflight and the children of darkness.” Rightly claiming that restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 werepart of a Masonic plot to establish a New World Order. Archbishop Viganò, who was the once-powerful VaticanApostolic nuncio to the United States between 2011 and 2016, published another strong message/open letteraddressed this time to all American Catholics, and Americans of Good Will, on November 4th 2020, where hewarned that America was amid a colossal electoral fraud, and we must pray now to defeat the enemy. This is acouple of the most significant passages of his historic message, that unfortunately, as well know, was not enough tokeep Trump in the White House.​News of electoral fraud is multiplying, despite the shameful attempts of the mainstream media to censor thetruth of the facts to give their candidate the advantage. There are states in which the number of votes is greaterthan the number of voters; others in which the mail-in vote seems to be exclusively in favor of Joe Biden; othersin which the counting of ballots has been suspended for no reason or where sensational tampering has beendiscovered: always and only against President Donald J. Trump, always and only in favor of Biden.[165]​ Adding towards the end of the letter words of great hope and wisdom:​Do not allow yourselves to be discouraged by the deceptions of the Enemy, even more so in this terriblehour in which the impudence of lying and fraud dares to challenge Heaven. Our adversaries’ hours arenumbered if you will pray, if we will all pray with Faith and with the true ardor of Charity. May the Lord grantthat one single devout and faithful voice rise from your homes, your churches, and your streets! This voice willnot remain unheard, because it will be the voice of a people that cries out, in the moment when the storm ragesmost fiercely, “Save us, Lord, we are perishing!” (Mt 8:25).[166] ​ However, Archbishop Viganò has never given up and one year later, in November 2021, he released anotherimportant message, addressing in a video the people of all faiths to unite in a worldwide anti-globalist alliance tofree humanity from the totalitarian regime. Now we should start considering this an international call for the creationof an anti-globalist alliance to defeat the evil elites who wish to enslave free men and women and promote a“Religion of Humanity that cancels Faith in Christ” as the official beginning of our Great Reject. In the video inquestion, Archbishop Viganò says among other things:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"​This Anti-Globalist Alliance will have to bring together the Nations that intend to escape the infernal yokeof tyranny and affirm their sovereignty, forming agreements of mutual collaboration with Nations and peopleswho share their principles and the common yearning for freedom, justice, and goodness. It will have todenounce the crimes of the elite, identify those responsible, denounce them to international tribunals, and limittheir excessive power and harmful influence. It will have to prevent the action of the lobbies, above all byfighting against the corruption of state officials and those who work in the information industry, and byfreezing the capital used to destabilize the social order.[167]​ And in another video, published at the beginning of December 2021, Archbishop Viganò, stands up onceagain against the New World Order, and their insane and immoral actions taking place around the world, responding“to corruption with honesty, to lies with truth” and mentioning and denouncing the activities of Dr. Evil, aka KlausSchwab, his demented World Economic Forum, their “fourth industrial revolution,” “The Great Reset,” and even theUnited Nations with their infamous Agenda2030. For this reason, I want to include the whole letter of ArchbishopViganò in my book as an important testimony of these incredible times we are living.​Dear Friends,Allow me to address you as you denounce the most controversial and disturbing aspects of the experimentalgene serum with great and commendable commitment. Your battle for scientific truth, coupled withincreasingly coordinated action by countless scientists and doctors around the world, is opening the eyes ofmany people who have allowed themselves to be misled by the false promises of health authorities, by thediscordant opinions of experts, and by media propaganda.I will not go into the merits of the health issue in itself, as you are much better informed than I am. Allowme to bring to your attention some reflections, observing the entirety of what is happening without focusing onspecific details.It now seems clear to me that the main purpose of this grotesque health charade is the imposition of acontrol system for individuals, implemented through the so-called green pass. We know that the healthpassport had been designed years ago, but that make it mandatory it was necessary to create a pandemicemergency and force the population – through blackmail or the threat of sanctions – to allow themselves to beinjected with an experimental drug for which the producer, the State, and whoever administers it do not assumeany responsibility, pouring it instead onto the patient. Just yesterday, the FDA decided to make public thereasons for approving the Pfizer vaccine only in 2076: this gives ample proof of the criminal mind behind thescreen of public health.We see therefore that we have an elite of criminals, gathered together in the World Economic Forum toconceive the Great Reset and in the United Nations to implement the Agenda2030, who have decided todecimate the population of the planet through some “scenarios” described in detail. They destroy nationaleconomies, cause poverty and unemployment, create discrimination and violations of fundamental rights withthe sole purpose of controlling survivors, tracing their movements, modifying their lives, deciding theirthinking, and establishing their health regime. This work includes the collaboration of rulers, public officials,doctors, magistrates, law enforcement agencies, the media – as if that weren’t enough – even religious leaders.Calling it a “conspiracy theory” is an understatement: it is a coup d’état pursued with a clear mind anddetermination, a crime against humanity. Its purpose is precisely to control us: to make us slaves andcustomers of a system that is about to implode, in which those who have made the most profits in the pastcreating the crisis, are now preparing to carry out the “fourth industrial revolution” – as Klaus Schwab calls it– to continue accumulating power and money.The imposition of the health passport and the so-called vaccination are part of this project. It matters littlethat the Constitutions of the States and the most elementary principles of law are violated with impunity in thename of an emergency that was artfully provoked; it matters little that eminent personalities of the world ofmedicine denounce the serious side effects of the gene serum and the criminal management of the pandemic; itmatters little that the macroscopic conflicts of interest existing between pharmaceutical companies, medicalstaff, health officials and mainstream information are well-known: their narrative does not contemplaterefutations, does not accept criticism, does not tolerate the evidence of the facts.But if an elite has managed to corrupt the rulers and carry out a real coup against the citizens, wecannot respond locally: if the aggression is global, the action of opposition and resistance must likewise beglobal. I therefore also renew my invitation to you, who as scientists understand very clearly the danger of theexperimental drug, asking you to join an Anti-globalist Alliance, to be able to counter this undeclared – but noless ruthless and violent – world war in a unitary and coordinated way."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Our enemy is not the virus, but the insanity of those who betray their duties to the detriment of thecommunity, of those who believe they can impose the Chinese totalitarian model and social credit in ournations, in the name of Communist collectivism that takes away identity and freedom to each of us.This global betrayal must be stopped: let’s respond to corruption with honesty, to lies with truth, to self-interest with the generous dedication to public affairs, to the desire for power and money with selfless serviceand a sense of duty.We reject not only the pandemic delirium, but the entire castle of horrors of the globalist ideology: theculture of death of abortion and euthanasia, gender theory, the indoctrination of our children, the “cancelculture,” uncontrolled immigration, the demolition of the natural family, the reduction of the protection andwages of workers, the persecution of small businesses. Let’s go back to being proud defenders of traditionalvalues: God, Nation, and Family. Let’s return to praying to the Lord, recognizing him as King not only ofindividuals but of all nations and societies. Only understanding the war in progress, identifying the opponentsand their criminal aims will allow us to resist and win.If we limit ourselves to looking only at the efficacy of the gene serum, or the reliability of the test swabs, orthe response that a single country has given to the spread of the infection, we will never get out.Remember: if the attack is global, the counteroffensive must also be global. And may God assist and protectus.+ Carlo Maria Viganò, ArchbishopFormer Nuncio to the United States of America[168]​ Unfortunately, as also pointed out by Jim Hoft at The Gateway Pundit on December 5th 2021 in an article thatmysteriously disappeared a couple of days later, “Archbishop Viganò is the object of evil attacks by the mainstreammedia and the globalist left because he stands with Catholics, Christians, and even non-believers who have thirst forjustice and truth in this confusing and dangerous world we are living in.”[169] So, we need to support Viganò’smission, and we need to stand united against the Great Reset, while the incumbent system is busy banning mentholcigarettes, encouraging the even more polluting electric cars that will help end the destruction of the rain forest[170],gearing up for negative interest rates, and undergoing mass conversion to a peculiar new religion called“Wokeness,” that we all know already won’t work for the common folk, only for the libtard extremist. For thisreason, the non-conventional Italian journalist Cesare Sacchetti, who has interviewed the former Nuncio, in earlyDecember 2021, and describes himself as “politically incorrect and heretical”, says that Viganò “terrifies thehierarchy of the anti-Catholic church of Bergoglio.” Adding in the following introduction to the exclusive interviewwith the archbishop this excellent description:This man has been the object of tremendous and evil attacks by the mainstream media. They have beentrying to smear him and depict him as a criminal or like someone who is putting society in great danger. Thisman is Archbishop Viganò. His Excellency has become like a polar star of hope for those Catholics and evennon-believers who have thirst for justice and common sense in this upside-down world. Viganò has beenspeaking calmly but his gentle voice has terrified the powerful people of the world. Viganò has exposed theGreat Reset and the plan to destroy mankind. He denounced the infiltration of Freemasonry into society andthe Church.In other words, Viganò is guilty of having said the truth like a humble pastor of God. In this interview thatHis Excellency granted us, he once again tells us in what kind of historical period we are living. He alsoconsoles us by reminding us that being persecuted for loving God and having Faith is the greatest honor thatwe may have. This is probably why so many people look at this man in this historical period. He’s one of thefew pastors that can speak simply to the hearts of the common men.[171]​ In the interview that follows Cesare Sacchetti poses two very interesting questions that relate to the Satanicnature of the Great Reset to Archbishop Viganò:In the “Great Reset” society that Your Excellency has denounced on numerous occasions, the“transhumanist” ideology plays a fundamental role. Modern technology is advancing at a very fast pace andwe are now speaking openly about the possibility of controlling human behavior through brain microchipimplants. One who favors this new model of “human/robot” is Klaus Schwab, a character whom we havemet in the previous questions, the head of the World Economic Forum. Do you think that the final purposeof transhumanism is really this, to deprive man of his God-given free will?"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Transhumanism is a hellish project, in which the Devil mocks the creation of God by perverting andcorrupting it. Obedience to the “easy yoke” of the Law of God is replaced by the enslavement and submissionto Satan’s tyranny, in which there is no tolerance for good and everyone is forced to commit evil, accept evil,and legitimize evil. And despite the fact that only God can read our consciences, Satan tries to violate thesanctuary of our inner spiritual part to control it and induce us to commit evil even against our will. In hisrecent book, The Great Reset, Klaus Schwab wrote the following:“We are also studying new ways to use and implant internal devices that monitor our levels of activity, thehematochemical values and the ways in which these can be associated to wellbeing, to mental health, and toproductivity at home and at work. We are also learning better the functioning of the brain and witnessingexceptional developments in the neurotechnology area.” It is a delirium that only Lucifer can conceive, and it is destined to complete failure because of itsAntichristic matrix, its defying of the divine Kingship of Jesus Christ. It is a delirium where the creature,rebelling against the divine laws, pretends to reach the place of the Highest and repeats, with the samedisgraceful determination, the “Non serviam” (“I will not serve”) of Lucifer.Satan is simia Dei (“an ape of God”): in everything that he does to keep us away from God and drag ustoward Hell, we can always see his mocking attempt to imitate the Savior, to usurp His sovereignty, to pervertHis teachings and to steal souls from Him. The Devil wants to be worshipped in the place of God. He wants theAntichrist to rule over the world and subjugate mankind to his tyranny by replacing the Church of Christ withthe anti-Church of Satan, which is the Religion of Mankind, an ecumenical and ecological one.In your videos and articles, you have spoken about the threat represented by the New World Order(NWO). Several statesmen and prime ministers, such as George H. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Nicolas Sarkozy,and David Rockefeller – just to name a few– used this expression in their public statements. Thesepoliticians describe the NWO as a sort of “Eden” we all should aim for. During the COVID crisis, we havebeen often hearing these words. Can you explain the idea that drives the New World Order and why vaccinesplay a very important role in the fulfillment of this goal?The New World Order is neither New nor Order: it represents the foolish ambition of Satan to overthrow theprovidential plan of God, to cancel the true Religion that leads to eternal salvation, and finally to replace the“ordo christianus” (“the Christian order”) with infernal chaos. In this disorder, the lie replaces the Truth,injustice, and abuse of power replace justice, whim instead of obedience to the law of God, death instead oflife, illness instead of health, the legitimization of Evil and the condemnation of Good, the persecution of goodpeople and the praising of evil ones, ignorance in the place of culture and wisdom, ugliness and horror insteadof beauty, division and hatred instead of harmony and love. Satan doesn’t want to be worshipped by adoptingthe qualities of God, but by demanding to be an object of adoration through everything that is evil, obscene,false, absurd, and monstrous. He seeks complete subversion, a subversion ontologically devilish andAntichristic: a “New Order” obtained by means of a global coup d’état imposed under the guise of anengineered planned emergency.The vaccine campaign, lacking any scientific validity, serves first of all as the apparent legitimization forimplementing global tracking and controls, today under the pretext of limiting COVID spread (a pretext whichis false, because, among other reasons, the vaccinated can still become infected and be contagious). Buttomorrow, this campaign aims to expand its reach, extending the “Green Pass” to include information used ina “social credit system” to confront a “green emergency,” which will be likewise false and specious. The“Green Pass” is being conceived as something like the Mark of the Beast mentioned in the Apocalypse of SaintJohn to allow or forbid people to buy, sell, travel, spend, eat and live.Secondly, the inoculation of people with an experimental genic serum that provokes a weakening of ournatural immune system represents a very grave crime, because it turns ordinary healthy people into chronicallyill people, and consequently into customers of the health care companies and private care. This situationhugely inflates the profits of the globalist élite and brings a general impoverishment of the population. Eventhis aspect, apparently secondary, reveals the subversive character of the “Great Reset,” because the “GreatReset” does not represent only an attack against the health of an individual, but also an attack against thenational security of the States, because their armed forces are harmed by the side effects of the vaccine, whilethe not-vaccinated soldiers are banned from active duty. I think that this is a point not enough considered bythose who are analyzing the present crisis, and it shows the malice of those who Once in power, cooperate forthe destruction of nations in order to subjugate them to the New Order.[172]​ The shocking words of Carlo Maria Viganò, archbishop of the Catholic Church who served as the ApostolicNuncio to the United States, confirm once and for all the Satanic nature of the Great Reset, and the hellish nature of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The New World Order. It should come as no surprise then, that in December 2021, Dr. Gwyneth Anne Spaeder, asenior Catholic doctor, whose family profits from the pharmaceutical industry and has links to various vaccineoligarchs, launched a vicious attack against Viganò for conscientiously objecting to the abortion-tainted jab. She didit with a 6,000-word article published by the Italian blog Corrispondenza Romana, which is edited by ProfessorRoberto de Mattei, a corrupt Catholic Italian historian, who had already outraged fellow traditionalists after he beganjustifying the morality of abortion-contaminated vaccines. Dr. Gwyneth Anne Spaeder, a specialist ingeneral pediatrics and adolescent medicine, who failed to disclose in the article her wide-ranging financial conflictof interests with Big Pharma, insisted that her conclusions were “scientifically sound,” defending both the Pfizer andModerna vaccines, as “among the 'cleanest' vaccines ever made” with “no long-term adverse effects emerging.”However, Spaeder admitted at one point that there is a \"very small risk of myocarditis\" following the Pfizer andModerna vaccines, but she considers it “mild and resolves itself.” Even asserting that “Catholics have no reason tofear the safety, efficacy, or morality of COVID mRNA vaccines.” Adding that, “In fact, science has not taken anyshortcuts: the safety and efficacy studies for both Pfizer and Moderna have been enormous and had all thecredentials to support the conclusions put forward.” Trashing the reliability of the Vaccine Adverse EventsReporting System (VAERS), the medic also conveniently claimed “there is no way to separate any garbage fromwhat may be valid concerns before an investigation is conducted” and “many will insert nonsense” into the database.[173] In comments made after the article in question came out to my friends at Church Militant, Archbishop Viganòsaid he was shocked to learn that a response to his concerns had been “entrusted by Corrispondenza Romana tosomebody like Gwyneth A. Spaeder, a pediatrician graduated from Johns Hopkins University that Viganò describedas “the daughter of well-known author and activist George Weigel, wife of Dr. Jeffrey Spaeder, who is ChiefMedical and Scientific Officer of IQVIA, a company linked to the pharmaceutical industry, and in particular, to themanufacturers of the so-called vaccines for COVID-19. It is a pity to see Corrispondenza Romana siding with SantaMarta (Pope Francis' residence), perhaps not so much out of conviction as out of opportunism,” the prelatelamented, “but I am a bit disappointed to see how clumsy and counterproductive it was to have entrusted therefutation to a pediatrician in clear conflict of interest.”[174]But Archibishop Viganò, shouldn’t be surprised, after all, the Vatican has been corrupted inrecent years by Pfizer, one of the biggest and most powerful players in the Big Pharma industry, indicated byChurch Militant as the “World's Most Corrupt Jab Giant.” Pfizer was once fined $2.3 billion in 2009 for what wasthen the largest health care fraud settlement ever. The company also spent over $21.8 million in 2019–2020, and$6.7 million from January–August 2021 on lobbying the government, making it the biggest spender of anyindividual drug company during the COVID-19 crisis. The fact this protagonist of the vaccine frenzy has beenmeeting in secret with Pope Francis was confirmed in January 2022 by known journalist and author, Edward Pentin,in The National Catholic Register, the oldest Catholic periodical in the United States, who made a shockingdiscovery that confirms our worst fears about the vaccine-pushing Jesuit pope:The Register has learned that Pope Francis privately held undisclosed meetings with the CEO of Pfizer lastyear as questions arise over the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing transmission, which is now beingmandated for all Vatican staff and visitors.According to Vatican sources, the Holy Father twice met Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the Vatican,although the precise details are not known. Unlike most papal private audiences, these meetings were notannounced by the Holy See Press Office, which did not respond to repeated requests to confirm the meetings. APfizer spokesman said, “We can’t confirm or deny as, per our policy, the movements of our executives areconsidered confidential.”Bourla’s meetings with the Pope would not be the first such unannounced papal encounter in recent years.In November 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 health emergency began, the Pope privately received MelindaGates. The meeting, well-known in the Vatican, was not announced and has never been officiallyacknowledged.Last May, Bourla took part in an online Vatican health conference titled “Unite to Prevent & Unite toCure” that included a significant focus on COVID-19 treatments and prevention as well as providing aplatform for promoting vaccines produced by large pharmaceutical companies.[175]​ The Vatican is in the hands of Satan working to implement the infamous “Mark of the Beast,” andArchbishop Vigano is a rare religious leader in the Catholic Church who dares to speak the truth. Even rarer, heunderstands what is happening with the infamous Great Reset, that’s why on September 29, 2019, Patriarch ElijahAnthony Dohnal of the pro-Russian Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church (UOGCC), that originally splitfrom the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, in 2009, not only declared an anathema on the 26 cardinals, 134"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"bishops, and 99 priests, who participated to the infamous Amazon Synod but in the same period, on October 14,2019, the Synod of the UOGCC, elected Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò as their Pope.

You will have to fulfill his genocidal vaccination plan. Surely you know that the mRNA vaccinedisrupts the human genome, among other things. It is associated with graphene, spike protein production, andthe blood of sadistically murdered unborn babies. Actually, this is not even a vaccination, this is satanic anti-baptism. In addition, there is a vain hope that it will be all over after the third vaccination; there is already talkof a fourth one.

The Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter is a traditionalist Catholic society of apostoliclife for priests and seminarians which is in communion with the Holy See, not be confused with The Society of SaintPius X (SSPX), founded by Marcel Lefebvre. The society was founded in 1988 under the leadership of 12 priestswho were formerly members of the Society of Saint Pius X. The response thus far has been interesting—the FSSPreleased a statement saying they were shocked and saddened and fully cooperating with law enforcement. Someparishioners insisted, however, that he was innocent and that he might have been framed, not solely because theylove their priest, but because of an ongoing conflict within the church between traditionalists and the modern post-Vatican II liturgy, that has seen Pope Francis doubling down in December 2021, on his efforts to sabotage the oldLatin Mass, forbidding the celebration of some sacraments according to the ancient rite in his latest salvo againstconservatives and traditionalists. ​ The Associated Press reported that Francis said he, “was reversing his predecessor because Benedict’s reformhad become a source of division in the church and been exploited by Catholics opposed to the Second VaticanCouncil, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church and its liturgy.”[178] The Vatican explained that theclarifications and new restrictions were necessary to preserve the unity of the church, and its sacraments, but thetruth is the devil hates Latin, which used to be the universal language of the Church, and there is an increasingnumber of people who are not necessarily linked, neither to the Fraternity of St. Peter, or the more traditionalSociety of Saint Pius, who are becoming frustrated with Pope Francis. Normal Catholics all over the world arealarmed by the progressive reforms of this Jesuit demon.On 29 June 2021, precisely on the day of the 70th anniversary of the priesthood of “PopeEmeritus” Joseph Ratzinger, which is also the anniversary of Saints Peter and Paul, Prof. Antonio José SánchezSáez, Professor of Law at the University of Seville (founded in 1505), made some astonishing statements againstPope Francis during an interview with the Italian newspaper Libero[179], given after Bergoglio’s drastic demolitionof the Summorum Pontificum – the most important act of Pope Benedict XVI’s pontificate which liberalized(dutifully) the Latin Mass – the mass par excellence, endowed with “absolute guarantees of Catholicity.” I havedecided to propose this important interview in my book on a subject that – take note – all the mainstream mediatoday tend to avoid like the plague and inexplicably, so does a large part of the traditional-conservative world stilloperating under the Holy See, which probably deludes itself into being able to combine agreements for the post-Bergoglio era, while ignoring the inevitable sword of Damocles of a natural anti-papal succession, in the case ofRatzinger’s invalid renunciation. Because this is the most controversial subject of today in the Catholic world, thepossibility of an invalid succession between Benedict XVI and Pope Francis. Well with 80 publications, severalimportant studies and research made for the Universities of Harvard, Bologna, Florence, Frankfurt, Sorbonne, and 5academic awards, Professor Sànchez, is a very credible source on this matter, who has also been writing for years onthe Catholic website comovaradealmendro.es.

I repeat he is neither a Lefebvrian nor a sedevantist only aconcerned Catholic, with a traditional view of the Church that seems to think Pope Francis’s papacy is fraudulent.You need to read the interview in question very carefully because it makes you understand the position ofArchbishop Viganò and millions of Catholics around the world who don’t feel this is the Church of Jesus Christ, butrather the opposite. Pope Francis’ “Pachamama Church” promotes New Age paganism instead of God, opening thedoor to adherence to the occult for greater numbers of people than before, which in turn opens the way to diabolicalpossession and The Great Reset of the Catholic Church, ready to be transformed into a One World Masonic Religionfor the imminent arrival of the Antichrist.Q. Professor, you have been saying for some time that you are following our investigation into the resignation ofBenedict XVI ...A. “For many years, those who thought that the only reigning pope was Benedict XVI were alone,misunderstood by the Church. It is comforting to see how an important Italian newspaper has chosen to discuss thisissue, which is fundamental, not only for Catholics.Q. No other news organization talks about it, yet it should be the journalistic case of the millennium ...A. “The overwhelming majority play that card. Bergoglio is a bad pope, but ultimately the pope. They criticizehis delusions, but consider him a father. And this strengthens it, others are simply worldly Catholics, happy with hisinnovations. Finally, others suspect that Francis is an impostor, but they don’t dare to talk about it in public ”.Q. From your website, you claim that ecclesiastical Freemasonry forcibly placed Bergoglio on the throne ofPeter. What evidence?A. “From the appreciation of the international lodges, to the inclusion of Masonic elements in the liturgy anddevotion, to the rhetoric on the Universal Brotherhood ... Suffice it to say, Father Malachi Martin, a highlycultivated Jesuit advisor to Card. Bea, who read the entire Third Secret of Fatima (including the words of Our Ladynot yet revealed), wrote a book called “Windswept House” where he explained the plan of ecclesiasticalFreemasonry: to force the pope to resign to impose a false pope who, exploiting the obedience of the clergy and thefaithful, will lead the Church to the great apostasy prophesied by St. Paul. What Malachi Martin did not know is thatBenedict XVI has been prepared for some time and did not resign validly, remaining pope: a master’s game.”Q. For what main reasons would your waiver be invalid?A. “I was surprised when I calmly read the Declaratio di Renouncement in Latin: Pope Benedict did notrenounce the munus, as required by canon 332.2 of the Code of Canon Law, but the ministerium, as if a professorresigned from teaching without leaving his chair, remains a professor at the University. Furthermore, Benedict XVIhas given us another clue by becoming “Pope Emeritus,” a canonically impossible title since to be emeritus it isnecessary to have ceased from office by age or by accepted resignation ... and neither of these conditions is met inresignation of a pope (can. 185).”Q. Do you think he did it on purpose? How does the well-known philosopher Giorgio Agamben ventilate to“strengthen the papacy?”A. “I have read Agamben’s book,” The Mystery of Evil Benedict XVI and the end of time.” I agree thatBenedict XVI currently acts as a “katejon,” a “power that holds back” the revelation of the Antichrist (MassimoCacciari also spoke of this). We know that Benedict XVI is perfectly familiar with the Marian messages of Fatima,Garabandal, and Akita. He deliberately acted in this way, knowing that the wolves would come for him (becausethey had already done so against John Paul II). So he pretended to resign, but without doing so, remained pope. ”Q. How do the Bergoglian canonists counter-argue?A. “Basically they say that even if the renunciation is wrong, it is validated by the unanimous and peacefulacceptance of Francis by the Church (“Universalis Ecclesiae Adhaesio “). A tragic mistake, because this doctrinewas never intended to save, heal or consider satisfied the condition without which a proceeding could never beinitiated.

For can. 126 (doctrine of substantial error,) Benedict’s resignation was void, the seat was notvacant and it is impossible to remedy this substantial error, a posteriori. It does not matter that the overwhelmingmajority of the Church believes that the Pope is Francis: even the Jews preferred Barabbas to Jesus, but they werewrong.”Q. In the interview in the book, “Latest Conversations,” Ratzinger says he resigned, like the popes who, inhistory, have not abdicated. WHO If he is still the pope, is Bergoglio?A. “At least one ANTIPAPA. Moreover, many believe that he is the False prophet of the Apocalypse. ”Q. Many think that after Francis, a new conclave can put things right. Is that so?A. “Absolutely NOT! A conclave with 80 cardinals appointed by an antipope can elect only one other antipope.Bergoglio’s entire succession line is anti-papal. There will no longer be an ecclesial restoration, but a descenttowards the great apostasy of the visible Catholic Church, which will persecute the faithful “little remnant,” the trueChurch.”Q. By the way, Don Minutella’s channel, the most followed priest in Italy and loyal to Benedict, has been closedby Youtube or hacked ...A. “Exactly. They need to silence dissent and make use of the complicity of social networks.”Q. The Catholics who are scandalized by Bergoglio’s “reforms” and avoid asking themselves if he is the realpope ... do they evade the “Magna Quaestio?”A. “Yes. Unfortunately, on this line of thought, there are the Principles of the Church such as Card. Sarah,Müller, and Archbishop Viganó, etc. that confuse many people.”Q. In a recent interview, Fr. Francesco recommended not to waste the crisis, but to use it to establish a “NewWorld Order.” Should we also worry about the laity? A. “Obviously: this project concerns everyone. In particular, the UN for decades has been promoting whatCatholics think are “sins that cry to Heaven” such as abortion, euthanasia, or gender ideology. John Paul II andBenedict XVI already denounced it. And now Bergoglio is perfectly united with the New World Order, atheist, anti-Christian and asks for obedience to the UN.”Q. Why don’t bishops and cardinals address this issue? It is an enormous historical and spiritual responsibility...A. “The architects of the New World Order now dominate the world and the Church. Informed cardinals andbishops fear causing a schism if they speak out. But it is absurd to think that Christ can want unity in lies, for thisreason, in history, the heretics have left the Church, purifying it. Now the schism will reverse: it will be those whoprofess the Catholic Truth who will be expelled from the Church. ”​ Andrea Cionci, the young Italian journalist who made this daring interview, writes in the end the followingconclusions, that seem to confirm what I wrote earlier, regarding Pope Francis’ real intention to eliminate the oldLatin Mass, to help the creation of the religion of The New World Order:We had already mentioned this possibility with the metaphor of the “cuckoo.” For now, the questioncontinues to be swept under the rug, in a really curious way. There is an enormous difficulty in making a localmind change. Probably we will have to wait for the next stop of the modernist train, when the Mass of the newrite, already tampered with, will undergo the next changes, predictably, with a view to eliminate the dogma ofTransubstantiation as the historian Massimo Viglione explains.When intercommunion with Protestants or even an international interfaith conference or something similararrives to create the religion of the New World Order, then perhaps the most obvious of possible explanationswill begin to be considered.[180]"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"FIG. 17 –– Antonio Jose Sanchez Saez. Current academic status: University Professor, Law Faculty, Seville University.How to Prepare for The Great Reject and Societal Collapse All this evil brings to my mind a particularly vivid example I once saw in an article written by Mark E. Jeftovic,a 30-year veteran of the Internet, and co-founder & CEO of easyDNS Technologies, a Toronto based web servicescompany, who talked about a balloon disaster that still makes him cringe when he thinks about it:A group of people were embarking on a balloon ride and as they were just a foot or two off the ground, theburner erupted into flames. The balloon pilot realized the situation immediately and he leapt from the gondolawhich was still only a few feet off the ground. One or two of the passengers were quick-witted enough to realize what this meant and followed him. Thisset off a feedback loop: as the fire expanded, its hot air forcing the balloon higher, combined with the weightreductions as the first few people bailed out, the situation very quickly escalated past a point of no return. The balloon had accelerated very rapidly to heights from which it was no longer possible to leap safely.The unfortunates who had hesitated and were trapped in a gondola being propelled higher by a fireball, totheir inevitable doom. [181]​ For Jeftovic, “Mass demonstrations, mass exoduses, crypto-currencies are symptoms of a Great Reject,[182]“and the Great Reset is for Mark E. Jeftovic, “an attempt at a zeitgeist-level rationalization that doubles down oninstitutional failure on the part of the entire governance structure of Mr. Global and gives them a new lease on life toremain in charge. Reimagined by the Davos crew amplified by the mainstream media, lubricated by Big Tech.”[183]Jeftovic also adds this final reflection on the balloon episode described above saying: “That’s what our entiresituation feels like today. The balloon is still hanging a foot or so above the ground, the canopy is on fire, and thepeople who have figured out what this means are bailing out while they still can and in-doing-so are accelerating theultimate burn-then-crash of the entire system.”[184]   Now in the 2020s, most of us should prepare rather than panic for “the crash of the entire system” because weare part of “The Great Reject,” which is our only hope, and we need to do this by using our skills and our resources,creating new communities, while the old system will continue to implode in the years ahead. With this book, I wantto lay the foundation for something truly historical, because in this context we need to find our own “Galt's Gulch,”the name of the utopia described in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a novel first published in 1957 in the United Statesthat suggested that pure reason ought to be rated superior to emotion in this context. Aside from the fact the plot is,unfortunately, written by an atheist, it describes the crumbling of the United States economy due to collectivism andaltruism, which Rand himself considered detrimental to society.[185] However I’m sure that Rand will probablyagree that the “collectivism and altruism” shown today in our hypocritical libtard society is probably more estheticalthan real, but the consequences are the same, as America is crumbling in front of our eyes.For this reason, some of us have decided to join what is being called “The AmericanRedoubt,” a rather unique political migration movement first proposed in 2011 by a former U.S. Army Intelligenceofficer, survivalist novelist, and known blogger, James Wesley Rawles, which designates Idaho, Montana, andWyoming along with parts of Oregon and Washington, as a haven for conservative Christians in theseunprecedented times. James Wesley Rawles chose a specific area of North America for “The American Redoubt,”,mainly due to its low population density and lack of natural hazards. “The American Redoubt” lies in the rural highcountry of Montana, in Idaho, in Wyoming, and in eastern Washington and Oregon.​ Like The Atlantic wrote in December 2021, “In rural Oregon, voters fed up with their state’s leftward turnhave embraced a simple and outlandish idea: What if we were just Idaho?” “The political diversity in this state isbecoming unpalatable,” argued Grant Darrow in a letter to the editor of his local paper. Rural Oregon. “RuralOregonians in general, and Eastern Oregonians in particular, are growing increasingly dismayed by how Oregon’sLegislature and Oregon’s urban dwellers have marginalized their values, demonized their lifestyle, villainized theirresource-based livelihoods, and classified them as second-class citizens at best.”[186]Unfortunately, this is the feeling of many Americans these days trapped in blue states likeOregon. That’s why USA Today estimated that anywhere from “hundreds” to “a few thousand” people may havemoved there as a result of this movement,[187]and there is even a real estate and consulting firm dedicated to helpingthe “oppressed people of all backgrounds flee tyranny and find freedom in rural towns across the American"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Redoubt, the last refuge of the American Patriot.”[188] To be honest, it seems there are a lot more people moving tothese areas, than the ones estimated by the leftist journalist of USA Today. Mainly because freedom-loving patriots,are increasingly worried about their future, and they seem to have a clear idea of the dangerous times in front of us,and how we should immediately leave the cities, and relocate as soon as possible to smaller rural communities.The American Redoubt will undoubtedly be the last hold out and battleground should society fall into theabyss. We will resist tyranny at all costs. So bring your friends and family and help us build a refuge for yearsto come. In the American Redoubt, All Lives Matter, regardless of race and we proudly support Blue LivesMatter. If that offends you, then please do not use our services. If you see value in raising your children todefend our God-given rights, then you should give us a call. We will NEVER take a knee in front of any naturalman.Flee the City and make your Strategic Relocation to the American Redoubt! The Last Refuge of theAmerican Patriot.[189]​ Of course, we can't guarantee you 100% that Rawles and his followers will be successful in their mission tocreate a “Strategic Relocation,” but unity means strength, that’s a fact that can’t be denied even by the skeptic, andfor this reason, the leftist media have already started their disinfo campaign against such projects years ago, often inthe disguise of investigative journalism or even worse tv entertainment like the “Doomsday Preppers,” that aired onNational Geographic from 2011 to 2014. Kim Murphy, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, for example, describedthe motivation for the movement back in 2012, in a derogatory and rather insulting manner, typical of the left, whoalways think conservatives are insane in preparing for the future, while they should have simply ignored all the signsof the impending doom and enjoy life.Murphy says: “For a growing number of people, it's the designated point of retreat when theAmerican economy hits the fan. When banks fail, the government declares martial law, the power grid goes down.When warming oceans flood the coasts and a resurgent Russia takes out targets on the Eastern Seaboard.”[190] In thesame article, Murphy, who identifies Rawles as “the guru of the movement,”[191] explains in typical libtard fashion,“Though white separatists for years have called for a racial homeland in the inland Pacific Northwest, an evenbigger movement of survivalists, Christian fundamentalists, and political doomsayers are fueling the idea of adefensible retreat in the high country west of the Rockies. Armed with stocks of brown rice, weapons, battery-operated radios and razor wire, many are preparing isolated homesteads that can quickly be turned into armedfortifications when groceries disappear from stores and hordes of desperate city-dwellers flee a flu pandemic or runout of oil.”[192] I wonder if ten years later, Kim Murphy feels the same way about his article, after all, most of thethings he mocked are materializing including the groceries that “disappear from stores,” the “flu pandemic,” or eventhe current oil crisis.In the end this arrogant journalist will probably become one of the “desperate city-dwellers” that flee in despair. We are moving towards a seemingly inevitable societal collapse, even the BBC“collapse expert” Luke Kemp, gives us an alarming view of the current situation: “Studying the demise of historiccivilizations can tell us how much risk we face today. Worryingly, the signs are worsening.”[193] Arguing in thesame article that the possibility of a civilization collapse is “a normal phenomenon.” So don’t disregard mywarnings as futile apocalyptic alarmism, but rather as useful tools of our Great Reject project.Societies of the past and present are just complex systems composed of people and technology. The theory of“normal accidents” suggests that complex technological systems regularly give way to failure. So collapse maybe a normal phenomenon for civilizations, regardless of their size and stage.We may be more technologically advanced now. But this gives little ground to believe that we are immuneto the threats that undid our ancestors. Our newfound technological abilities even bring new, unprecedentedchallenges to the mix.And while our scale may now be global, collapse appears to happen to both sprawling empires andfledgling kingdoms alike. There is no reason to believe that greater size is armor against societal dissolution.Our tightly coupled globalized economic system is, if anything, more likely to make crisis spread.[194]​ In popular usage, “apocalypticism” refers to a belief in the likely or impending destruction of the world (or ageneral global catastrophe), usually associated with upheaval in the social, political, and religious order of humansociety. Historically, the word has had religious connotations and the great destruction it is thought to bring hastraditionally been seen as part of a divine scheme, though today it is increasingly used in secular contexts because of"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"what is happening.[195] Of course, debates and disagreements, over genre and labels relating to apocalyptic literaturewill continue, including the Book of Revelation itself, but we have no time for complex theological and intellectualdiscussions on the matter as our society crumbles, we need instead, real alternatives and solutions to the growingproblems we will face in our lifetime. At this point, we need to understand and learn about survivalism, not thegenuiness, or not of the Book of Revelation, that I find out of the question, like most Christians.​ What is Survivalism? This is a commonly asked question, with no easy answer. Survivalism has many facetsand takes many forms. It means something different to everyone. Keep this in mind as I attempt to give you my bestanswer to this famous question, so let’s get in the mindset of the survivalist thanks to a few experts on the topic: Atits most basic level, survivalism is a mindset to keep an individual alive through adverse circumstances. Thesecircumstances could be lots of things, from a devastating flood or earthquake to a nuclear attack or civil war. Eachsurvivalist has a mental list of “risk situations” that he or she has determined to be a possible threat. These situationscould be very imminent threats or only slight threats. In any case, there is a chance of the risk situation occurring.The difference between a survivalist and any other person is that the survivalist has considered the threateningsituations and is taking steps to prepare in case they occur, whereas others have chosen to ignore the situations, ordon't perceive them as threatening. It's probably easier to give examples to illustrate my point. Let's say Ilive in the U.S. today, with only a few moments of thought, I can come up with a list of things that threaten mysurvival in this country. They would be for me, Civil War, famine, drought, terrorism, earthquakes ( I don't know ifearthquakes are common occurrences in your area, as I live in California), and, of course, a possible World War III.Now that I've determined the risk situations, I need to figure out which are most likely to occur, and which are lesslikely. So, I choose to order them like so: 1. Civil War2. Terrorism 3. Earthquakes 4. World War5. Famine 6. DroughtUnderstand, the above list is in order of chance of occurring, not in order of severity of the threat. In otherwords, I would be more afraid if my country broke out in war than if we had a drought, but I believe the chances of adrought occurring are far less than the chances of a civil war breaking out in the near future. Now that I have a list ofrisk situations, in order of probability of occurrence, I can make plans to prepare in case one or more of them occur.Once you understand the thought process that the above example shows, you understand the “Survival mindset.”You've assessed your risks and are now ready to prepare for them. How you prepare is up to you. The fact that youare preparing makes you a survivalist.         At this point let’s move further in the “MaterialPreparation,” mindful of one of the mottos of the survivalist is “Prepare for the worst, pray for the best.” Eachperson has to determine how they will prepare and must decide what lengths and expenses they will go to with theirpreparation. For some people, keeping a week’s worth of canned goods and a kerosene heater around the house maybe their way of preparing for a blizzard. For others, they may want not only the food and the heater but asnowmobile as well. Still, others may decide that if it looks like a terrible snowstorm, they'll take a trip to theirhouse in a warmer climate before it hits. In each example above, the person perceived the blizzard as a threat. Thelengths they went to prepare were all different. The first person decided extra food and a second heat source wasenough, while the last person wanted a place to escape to. No one can tell you how you should prepare for a disaster,because all of us have different situations we must take into account. The important thing is that you assess yourthreats, and determine how you can prepare for them if they occur. You need to do what you feel is necessary. If youfeel comfortable knowing that a week's worth of food and water is stocked up in your kitchen, you're prepared. Ifyou buy a house in Florida to fly off to because you relate better with the policies of that State, you're prepared.[196]​ Many survivalists pick the worst possible scenario to prepare for, and in the 2020s that’s what you shouldhave in mind. Others choose to prepare for moderate occurrences of their risk situations but such people might findthemselves in trouble with what is coming up in the next few years. Oftentimes, preparing for the worst involves alot of time and money, and you need to keep in mind, that even if you are a good survivalist, and know how to growyour own vegetables, or you know how to raise a few heads of cattle to stock your own freezer with wholesomesteaks, roasts, and other cuts of meat, remember that you will also need to defend all this, in front of a situation ofpossible chaos and social unrest, that regardless of you having a gun or not, might bring disruption and evil right toyour doorstep. In this case, I suggest you live in like-minded communities of gun-loving individuals because unity"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"means strength. Of course, as with all other aspects of survivalism, to what level each, individual prepares, is up tothem, but a strong community, where everybody is well equipped and has the right skills necessary to stay alive,creates a better possibility of survival, for yourself and your loved ones, that’s for sure.Now, you may feel comfortable, with a week’s supply of food at hand, you may want enough for anentire month. Or a year. It's an individual choice that only you can make. Of course, we need in all this: “SkillAssessment and Acquisition.”   Preparation doesn’t only involve acquiring materialitems, it means acquiring the skills you need to survive. Anyone can buy material goods and “survival gear” or evena weapon, but if you don’t have the skills and knowledge necessary to use that gear or your gun, your chances ofsurvival in any type of crisis lessen substantially. Let me make two examples to illustrate my point. We’ll say oneman lives in the city and feels that one of his risk situations is rioting. In order for him to survive, he feels he'll haveto leave his apartment and get to his \"safe house\", which is a friend's place in the country 75 miles away.Our second person lives in the country and feels his primary risk situation is loss of electricity during astorm or blizzard. In the first case, the city dweller may need to travel on foot for those 75 miles if the streets areblocked with traffic and such. The skills he’ll need are navigation, hiking, outdoor cooking, stealth, and possiblycaching for storing food along the way. He’ll also need to plan several travel routes to his destination, in case one isin a particularly bad state. He’ll need to consider that the riot could happen at any time of the year, so cold weathersurvival skills could come into play. Our second example has a different situation. He feels that a power loss is hisbiggest threat, so the skills he’ll need revolve around that. He should know how to cook over a fire, how to preservefood without a refrigerator, how to use oil lamps and kerosene heaters to keep warm during winter, and he shouldhave an alternate water supply set up so he can get water into his home without using an electric pump, and possiblyhave a portable power station. There are some excellent, and rather cheap indoor/outdoor battery backups thesedays, that use a solar generator, that you can find for under 500 dollars in many retailers that could be very handy inthe absence of fuel.However, in these two examples, both survivalists need to have knowledge and skills which areunique to their situations and after you determine what your risk situations are, and begin stocking up on supplies forthem, you need to assess your skills and learn what you feel you need to know, but I will also strongly advise in bothscenario’s, the possibility of buying a firearm, and, of course, learning how to use it, because you don’t want to beleft behind, in what seems like an arms race to defend ourselves from an increasingly unstable society.In May 2021, The New York Times stated: “Preliminary research data shows that about a fifth of allAmericans who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners. Sales usually spike around elections, but the sheervolume is notable.” In the article, they explain that: “Americans have been on an unusual, prolonged buying spreefueled by the coronavirus pandemic, the protests last summer, and the fears they both stoked.”[197] ​ And now let me make my final assessement on this very important subject, that pertains to your own survival,and the survival of your loved ones in these unprecedented times, as I’m not being an alarmist here, but a realist. Survivalism, as the experts see it, is made up of three basic elements - the survival mindset, materialpreparation, and skill assessment and acquisition. You must have all three to be properly prepared for a crisissituation.[198] You, as an individual need to determine what your risk situations are, and how to prepare for them.You must consider what skills and materials you'll need to survive each of your risk situations, then you'll need towork to acquire them.The next logical question people ask is “when am I prepared enough?” The answer is never the samebecause each of us has different situations. You're the only one who can determine when you've prepared enough.Others can help you assess your situations, or recommend goods and gear for a particular risk situation, but only youcan determine when you're ready to survive. One way you can make this determination is to test yourself. If you feelyou'll need camping skills to make it through a time of crisis, go camping for a few days and see how you make out.Or, if you believe you'll need to pack the car and leave in a hurry, try it. See if you can fit everything in the car youthought you'd be able to, and see how long it takes. If you're happy with the result, then you're prepared. If not, keepworking at it until you are. Remember survivalism is a mindset that must become a part of your life in the fightagainst the New World Order. It shouldn't dominate everything you do, but it should always be in the back of yourhead so you are ready, when others instead are panicking with no hope. Like the survivalist experts say you shouldapproach each situation in life with a few questions, two of which are “What are the possible risks involved?” and“What information, skills, or materials can I gain from this which will help me get by in risk situations?” Once youbegin to look at life from a survivalist’s point of view, you'll view many situations differently than you do now.Only after you've practiced using the survival mindset will you truly understand what I'm referring to.[199]Always remember to keep reading, keep learning, and keep stocking up and making yourself acquainted withthe use of guns. “Prepare for the worst, pray for the best,” says the survivalist.

An Alien Invasion?ET disclosure at the Pentagon and the Vatican cover-up their demonic alliesAt one point during the 1985 Geneva Summit, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachevtook an unusual break from negotiations to take a walk. Only their private interpreters were present, and for years,the details of what they talked about were kept secret from both the Russian and American public. But during a 2009interview with Charlie Rose and Reagan’s Secretary of State George Shultz,[200] as it was later reported also by theSmithsonian magazine, “Gorbachev revealed that Reagan asked him point-blank if they could set aside theirdifferences in case the world was invaded by aliens.”[201] Jimmy Orr described Gorbachev shocking statement forthe Christian Science Monitor in the following manner:Shultz was talking about the Lake Geneva summit and mentioned the two leaders ducked out of a meeting totake a walk to a nearby cabin.\"I wasn't there...,\" Shultz said before Gorbachev cut him off.\"From the fireside house, President Reagan suddenly said to me, 'What would you do if the United Stateswere suddenly attacked by someone from outer space? Would you help us?'\"I said, 'No doubt about it.'\"\"He said, 'We too.'\"\"So that's interesting,\" Gorbachev said to much laughter.[202] As the Smithsonian Magazine wrote on this unusual meeting, citing a previous article by Lauren Davis on the“Science Fiction That Caused Political Change”[203]:As far as we know, aliens never tried to take over the planet during the 1980s, so Reagan and Gorbachev’sinformal agreement wasn’t put to the test. But perhaps unsurprisingly for a president whose nuclear deterrentplan was nicknamed “Star Wars,” Reagan was a big science-fiction fan. He had grown up reading Edgar RiceBurroughs’ epic science-fiction novels, whose characters included John Carter of Mars and Tarzan, LaurenDavis reports for io9.Once in a while, Davis continues, Reagan's nerdy tastes in books influenced how he governed. During histenure in the White House, Reagan relied on The Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy, a thinktank made up of astronauts, engineers, and even science-fiction writers like Robert Heinlein and JerryPournelle, for advice on future technology and the emerging importance of space policy. In fact, the Councileven helped to draft parts of Reagan’s first speech introducing the “Star Wars” program.It’s hard to say how serious Reagan was when he asked Gorbachev if the Soviets would help fight off analien invasion, but he was far from the first government official to mull over out-of-this-world fighting tactics.During the 1950s and ‘60s, a group of U.S. Army engineers was tasked with thinking up theoretical weaponsthat could be used to defend non-existent lunar bases. And recently, Anatoly Zak reports for PopularMechanics, the Russian government revealed that in the 1970s, the Soviet Almaz space station was not onlyarmed with a top-secret space cannon, but it was also test-fired.[204]​ But President Reagan’s seemingly “weird” warning to the Russians, was repeated a couple of years later,during a speech before the United Nations in 1987, where President Ronald Reagan spoke longingly for the worldunity that would happen if aliens invaded Earth to a rather shocked audience of world leaders. Making it highlypossible he was not joking about it.​ He said:Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionallythink how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside thisworld.[205]"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" In the end, the Soviet Union might have collapsed also because of the shocking truth behind this seeminglyfictional threat that might have been more real than expected. Reagan also had another interesting warning in thesame speech:We cannot permit attempts to control the media and promote censorship under the ruse of a so-called ``NewWorld Information Order.'' However, on October 9, 1989, almost two years before the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was officiallysanctioned in December 1991 by Gorbachev’s resignation as President of the Soviet Union, the press agency TASS,came out with some truly shocking news about a possible alien encounter. According to an official report, thatseems to have indicated the 27th of September 1989, as the date for the extraordinary event, tall three-eyed alienswith small heads showed up in the city of Voronezh, arriving in a shiny ball (or a “banana-shaped” object), bringingwith them a robot looking creature. An Associated Press translation of the report read: ′′Scientists have confirmedthat an unidentified flying object recently landed in a park in the Russian city of Voronezh′′ TASS said, in a dispatchfrom the city, 300 miles southeast of Moscow. ′′They have also identified the landing site and found traces of alienswho made a short promenade about the park.”[206] They left behind them “two pieces of unidentified rocks,” madeof a substance that “cannot be found on Earth.” [207] When pressed, TASS Russia's leading news agency established in 1904, stood by their unusual report, and theNew York Times reported[208] that TASS added even more details a few days later. For example, the so fashionablealiens (demons?) were wearing “silvery overalls and bronze boots.” And, as TIME reported in the October 23rd,1989 issue, that wasn’t all in regards to the supposed “alien” encounters the Russians were having during the chaoticend of the Soviet Union:Earlier in the year, the newspaper Socialist Industry reported an “encounter” between a milkmaid in theregion of Perm and a cosmic creature that looked like a man but was “taller than average with shorter legs.”Last week the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda declared that not only had an Abominable Snowmanbeen caught stealing apples in the Saratov region but researchers had “registered the influence of energies” ata site in Perm, leading a geologist to conclude that they had discovered a landing field for flying saucers. Thesame story transcribed a telepathic discourse between Pavel Mukhortov, a journalist from Riga, and an all-too-knowing extraterrestrial.[209] In this groundbreaking scenario, Ronald Reagan’s warnings should be taken seriously. But not for “disinfoqueen” Rachel Maddow, that on her libtard central show back in September 2013, said “Ronald Reagan, wishing analien invasion on Earth because of the kumbaya effect it would have on relations among nations.” Was simply: “Oneof the truly weirdest things he ever said in public.”[210] However, that weird concept announced by Bohemian Clubmember Ronald Reagan, never went away dear Rachel, and at the end of 2021, the DAILY STAR reported that“NASA is hiring the help of 24 theologians as part of a plan to work out how the world's different religions wouldreact to news about extraterrestrial life. Among them is British clergyman Reverend Dr. Andrew Davison, atheologian at the University of Cambridge who also holds a doctorate in biochemistry from the rival Univerity ofOxford.” [211] The reason NASA is now hiring such experts is “because of advances in humanity's efforts to findlife in the great unknown.” The DAILY STAR added that “The NASA-sponsored scheme was held at the Center forTheological Inquiry at Princeton University in New Jersey to tackle questions about how life from another planetmay impact thinking about gods and creation. Rev Dr. Davison believes the prospect of finding a life that's out of this world is becoming more and morelikely. In Davison's book, Astrobiology and Christian Doctrine, he asks questions about whether God could havecreated life elsewhere in the universe. Or if he could have sent a savior to die for the sins of alien species?”[212]     Jesuit Guy Consolmagno, American research astronomer, physicist, current Director of the VaticanObservatory, and President of the Vatican Observatory Foundation, told the Sunday Herald a few years ago that hisjob included reconciling “the wildest reaches of science fiction with the flint-eyed dogma of the Holy See,” and thathis latest mental meander was about “the Jesus Seed,” described as “a brain-warping theory which speculates that,perhaps, every planet that harbors intelligent, self-aware life may also have had a Christ walk across its methaneseas, just as Jesus did here on Earth in Galilee. The salvation of the Betelguesians may have happenedsimultaneously with the salvation of the Earthlings.”[213]But as Dr. Thomas Horn says, this “Jesus Seed” conceptseems to resemble the panspermia hypothesis:"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"This sounds like a sanctified version of panspermia—the idea that life on Earth was “seeded” by something along time ago, such as an asteroid impact—but in this case, “the seed” was divinely appointed and reconciledto Christ.[214]​ The idea of panspermia, that our origins lie in a grand experiment, directed by an intelligent life somewhereout there in the universe, made its first big appearance in movies, in the opening scenes of Stanley Kubrick’sincredible 2001 Space Odyssey (1968), where some Neanderthal looking folk are scrounging for food, squabblingwith a neighboring tribe who are intent on competing for the meager lickings (a reactionary condition that would notbode well for future humanity). One of them picks up a large bone, and at that point, there’s instant recognition,seemingly influenced by a black obelisk that appears mysteriously, that the object in question can be suddenly usedas a weapon. His neighbor lies soon after in a crumpled heap full of blood. In what has become an enduring Sci-fiimage, he triumphantly hurls his weapon into the air, whereupon Kubrick transforms it using his magicalcinematographic touch into an orbiting space station. Kubrick’s imagery proposes that life on earth has a conductor,a who, or it, another intelligence, that directs the course of organic, including human, evolution.The movie script was co-written with Arthur C. Clarke, no stranger to Sci-fi or speculationsabout the origin of life, but also profoundly influenced by the late Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ (1881-1955), whose figure I analyzed and presented to you, in Confessions of an Illuminati vol.6.66.[215] As usual, it seemsthe infamous Company of Jesus and their Illuminati agents have embraced and promoted this hypothesis for a longtime. On the relevance of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s thought, the late Father Malachi Martin, a former member ofthe Society of Jesus wrote in his book, Jesuits:Without knowledge of Pierre Theilhard de Chardin, S.J., it would be very difficult for any non-Jesuit tounderstand the kind of change through which the Society of Jesus has passed, the almost perfected mode ofrecalcitrance to all, and any papal wish that Society has learned to practice, the utter sincerity of this attitude,and the distance that now separates the Jesuit outlook both from the original Ignatian ideal and the commonfaith of the Roman Catholic Church.[216]In 2005, Fr. Guy Consolmagno, a Jesuit, wrote a 50-page booklet, Intelligent Life in the Universe, published bythe Catholic Truth Society, in which he made the standard astronomical points—lots of galaxies, lots of stars, somewith planets, some of which may have conditions conducive to life. (Theological question: can God create life onlyin places with the right conditions? Or could He create life where there is, for instance, no water, or where thetemperatures are too hot or too cold? If not, why not?).[217]Three years later the unusual subject of extraterrestrialsand salvation, was hinted at again by Father Funes (Consolmagno’s predecessor as Director of the VaticanObservatory). In an interview from May 2008 that originally appeared in the Vatican newspaper L’OsservatoreRomano, in an article entitled, “The Extraterrestrial Is My Brother,” Funes, who is also a Jesuit, responds to thequestion of whether extraterrestrials would need to be redeemed, which he believes should not be assumed. “Godmade man in Jesus to save us,” he says. “If other intelligent beings exist, it is not said that they would have need ofredemption. They could remain in full friendship with their Creator.” By “full friendship,” Father Funes reflectedalready back then on how some Vatican theologians accept the possibility that an extraterrestrial species may exist,and that it might be morally superior to men, possibly closer to God than humans, and for that reason, they maycome here to evangelize us. [218]​ However, that “closer to God” aspect brought up by Fr. José Funes, SJ, should also make us think aboutanother possibility I would like to point out. The aliens in question might well be what we have always described asangels, after all, is what the Illuminati mystery schools teach, even today. Preternatural beings from above,occasionally interfere in the lives of mankind to help them out in the most crucial moments. However, the samemodality can also be used to describe them as demons, that can instead interfere and disrupt the course of history,leaving us with the eternal problem of the fallen angels, that both the New Agers and Jesuits alike, convenientlyleave out of the equation. Like the late UFO expert, John Alva Keel used to think the UFO manifestations seem tobe, merely minor variations of the age-old demonological phenomenon.[219] Regarding this highly controversialtopic, Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadik, founder of the Koshertorah School told History.com:​We know from the ancient legend of the Books of Enoch that there was a group of angels who descended toEarth in violation of divine law. They introduced to humanity, ways, means, and knowledge – science andtechnology which we would not understand today. These angels were in human form and called “ִאישׁ”, which"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"means “men” and looked just like us.[220]​ While Dr. Jonathan Young, founder curator of the Joseph Campbell Archives, describes the “Fallen Angels”as “giants”:​The Fallen Angels were giants. They were at least 10 ft tall, were very striking to look at and had enormouseyes and no wings.[221]​ For Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadik, the Torah, Judaism, and, of course, the Kabbalah, do indeed teach that we arenot alone in our universe and that we are not alone here on our planet. In Biblical, and later Judaic, and Kabbalisticliterature, there is a well-documented record of encounters with entities not of this Earth, and the Vatican NativityScene placed in Saint Peter’s Square in December 2020, seemed to incredibly address all this. On December 11,2020, at 4.30 p.m., as is custom, another Nativity scene was donated to the Vatican, this time by the Italian town ofCastelli, (the spearhead of the ceramic industry since the 16th century), but this time the work in question, whichwas created a few decades ago, between the 60s and 70s by pupils and teachers at the Art Institute “F.A. Grue,”seemed blatantly occult and bizarre, to say the least. A figure present in such monstrosity seems to refer to the“Ancient astronauts,” or “ancient aliens,” a pseudoscientific idea that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited ourplanet since prehistoric times, making direct contact with humans. It seems like a more pseudoscientific hypothesis,compared to panspermia, even if equally plausible, but why was the Vatican, trying to include it in the Nativityscene during Christmas 2020? Well, they are warming up the laity to an ET disclosure. In this “alien” Nativity”behind baby Jesus, there was also a very odd version of the Archangel Gabriel, who as Christians know, appears toZechariah and the Virgin Mary, foretelling the births of John the Baptist and Jesus (Luke 1:11–38), and is usuallyincluded in the traditional Nativity representations.Archangel Gabriel is placed on top of a djed, one of the more ancient and commonly foundsymbols in ancient Egyptian religion of great importance for the Illuminati and the Egyptian rites of Freemasonry intheir secret rituals. It is a pillar-like symbol in Egyptian hieroglyphs that represents stability. It is associated with thecreator god Ptah, God of craftsmen and architects, also very dear to the Freemasons and the Illuminati, and Osiris,the Egyptian god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead. Such stories fueled the birth of the mystery schooltradition that began when the Illuminati of the time, were taught the mysteries and secrets of the immortality of thehuman soul.Let’s always remember that the primary work of the Illuminati mystery schools and high priests has been sincethe science of human regeneration and immortality. The Djed symbol that is commonly understood to represent thespine of Osiris, is also something we find connected to the Osiris myth, and not the Nativity of our Lord JesusChrist, but here we go with Christmas 2020, and another strange episode from a year like no other, that the historybooks will be describing in the future as a turning point for humanity. ​ In the Osiris myth, Osiris was killed by the evil Set (later called Satan) by being tricked into a coffin made tofit Osiris. Set had the coffin with the deceased Osiris thrown into the Nile. The coffin was carried by the Nile to theocean and on to the city of Byblos, in Lebanon. It ran aground and a sacred tree took root and rapidly grew aroundthe coffin, enclosing the coffin within its trunk. The king of the land, intrigued by the tree’s quick growth, orderedthe tree cut down and installed as a pillar in his palace, unaware that the tree contained Osiris’s body. Meanwhile,Isis searched for Osiris, aided by Anubis, and came to know of Osiris’s location in Byblos. Isis maneuvered herselfinto the favor of the king and queen and was granted a boon. She asked for the pillar in the palace hall, and uponbeing granted it, extracted the coffin from the pillar. She then consecrated the pillar, anointing it with myrrh andwrapping it in linen. This pillar came to be known as the pillar of djed whose secrets are still taught in the IlluminatiMystery Schools.One of the most important Mystery Schools in Ancient Egypt was in Giza, and for AdamWeishaupt’s Illuminati Order, one of the greatest of the initiates of this school was a Hebrew, known today as Jesus.And to back up their claim they reference this controversial passage found in the New Testament of the King JamesVersion of the Bible at Revelations 11:8, which states:“And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,where also our Lord was crucified.”If the Bible is to be taken literally:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"“... where also our Lord was crucified” means:A. Jesus the Christ was crucified at least twice.B. He had to have survived at least the first event.This passage, that overturns the crux of Christian dogma, has always been taken into serious consideration byFreemasons, the Illuminati, and Theosophists like Eduard Schuré, a figure I talked about extensively in TheInvisible Master: Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors, and the Puppet Masters Who Pull the Strings of Occult Powerfrom the Alien World.It is evident that the Great Pyramids at Giza, in the precision of their dimensions and construction techniques,represented a realization of perfection by extremely knowledgeable individuals who used this place for theirinitiations.​ And for the Illuminati, if Revelations 11:8 is factual, it is also evident the Mystery School at Giza was also inpossession of methodology leading to trans-dimensional consciousness that the Illuminati still claims to possess. Allthis might sound far-out, check out the Illuminati Nativity displayed in St. Peters Square from the end of December2020 to the beginning of January 2021, if you have any doubts. Officially, the people responsible for the mostunusual Nativity to date were an art high school of design, which, in the decade 1965-1975, dedicated its teachingactivity to the Christmas theme, but many of the teachers of this institution were Freemasons, and of course, we allknow that Pope Francis is one too.New groundbreaking evidence about Pope Francis’ alleged Masonic membership originallysurfaced on Roberto Garcia’s TV program, La Mirada, which aired on November 27, 2017, on Channel 26 inArgentina. The astonishing claim was made on the show by Freemason Juan Bautista ‘Tata’ Yofre, who is anArgentine journalist and writer, and also a former politician, who was the Argentinian Secretary of Intelligence from1989 to 1990, in the early part of Carlos Menem’s presidency, and here is also another important element, thatexposes Pope Francis’ ties to German Freemasonry and the Illuminati.On May 31st, 2021, Pope Francis entrusted five intentions to the image of “Mary, Untier ofKnots” an image that in this period is having great diffusion and success, that is connected to a painting that is foundin St. Peter am Perlach, a Romanesque Catholic church in the center of Augsburg (Bavaria). Now, given that thesincere and loving devotion of believers – from the point of view of faith – is certainly heard and fulfilled by theVirgin Mary in the Catholic Faith, regardless of whether she is depicted in this or that image, there are someobjective facts that must be known regarding the image in question that is connected to a very relevant occultbackground.Francis is often accused of not particularly shining for his Marian devotion, he even denied theHoly Mary the title of Coredemptrix that is a title traditionally used within the Catholic Church for the BlessedVirgin Mary, as well as a Catholic theological concept referring to Mary’s role in the redemption of all peoples. It isa reverent title for the Blessed Mother and held as a pious belief in the Catholic Church, but not for Pope Francis. Heoften tends to define her only as “mother and disciple” with certain assonance with Lutheranism and has abrogatedthe Feast of the Translation of the Holy House of Loreto that I talked about extensively in volume 3 of myConfessions[222], practically declassifying the supernatural fact of the house of Mary transported by angels (testifiedby San Nicola da Tolentino) to mere legend and tradition.There has often been, an apparent pro-Protestant point of view by Pope Francis, and a visibleresistance to speak of the fundamental Marian dogmas, such as the perpetual virginity, mostly to not offend peopleof other denominations who are gradually joining his One World Religion project. However, there is a single Marianimage, in particular, that Bergoglio is very devoted to, Not Our Lady of Lourdes, nor that of Fatima, nor of theBlessed Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei, or Our Lady of Good Aid, all miraculous images, which healed in the pastthe terminally ill on many occasions performing incredible miracles, and protagonists of apparitions othersupernatural phenomena recognized by the church, in which obviously, those who have faith believe. It is anunusual image, devoid of the Child Jesus that the Jesuit Pope follows, and now I will explain why.The Catholic newspaper Avvenire writes that when in 1986 Bergoglio saw for the first time“Mary, Untier of Knots” he was “struck” by this image. Pope Francis, after seeing it while in Germany as a student,began promoting her veneration in Latin America printing hundreds of postcards of this painting and spreading themin Argentina and throughout South America with great success. The painting that was made around the year 1700 byJohann Georg Melchior Schmidtner for the Catholic pilgrimage church of St. Peter am Perlach, otherwise known asthe Perlach church, in Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany, and was donated around 1700 by Hieronymus AmbrosiusLangenmantel (1641-1718), a canon of the Monastery of Saint Peter in Augsburg."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"A parish priest in Buenos Aires, Juan Ramón Celeiro, following Pope Francis’advice, laterwrote a Novena to “Mary, Untier of Knots”, that must be recited over nine days, one verse a day in a modalityreminiscent of the Wiccan ritual of the nine knots. And here are the origins of the controversial image. The painting,executed in the Baroque style by Johann Georg Melchior Schmidtner (1625-1707), shows the Blessed Virgin Marystanding on the crescent moon (the usual way of depicting Mary under her title of the Immaculate Conception),surrounded by angels and with the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove hovering above her circle of stars as she untiesknots from a long ribbon and at the same time rests her foot on the head of a “knotted” snake. The serpent representsthe devil, and her treatment of him fulfills the prophecy in Genesis 3:15: “I will put enmities between thee and thewoman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.”In 1700, the German canon Hyeronimus Ambrosius Langenmantel commissioned the painter Schmidtern tomake a painting to commemorate a grace received from his grandfather, the noble Wolfgang Langenmantel, whohad serious marital problems with his wife Sophie during his lifetime, and to remember all the quarrels she had withher husband, she had filled the wedding ribbon which the Germans traditionally received when they got married atthe time with knots. A knot tightened with the ribbon symbolized, in fact, the marriage bond but many signifiedmany issues. Wolfgang, on the threshold of separation with his wife, brought the knotted ribbon to a Jesuit, FatherJakob Rem, who offered it to the Holy Mary. The Virgin, by a miracle, untied all the knots of the ribbon andrestored peace and love between husband and wife. Of course, compared to the extraordinary miracles of the otherMarian effigies, this one seems quite modest, yet Francis has spread an all-encompassing cult over it. Why? What isspecial about this image?Well, the Masonic “​Love Knot” or “Infinity Knot” is the type of knot used in early MasonicSymbolism commonly associated with the Tessellated Border, later replaced by a series of contiguous equilateraltringles extending around the perimeter of the Lodge floor. The “​Love Knots” symbolizes the union betweenFreemasons displaced all over the Earth. We then find out that Hyeronimus Langenmantel, who ordered the paintingin question, was a scholar who belonged to the Fruchtbringenden Gesellschaft, (Society of Carpophores) whichFreemasonry historians Ludwig Keller and Wolfstieg argued was a pseudo-Masonic Academy that had a biginfluence on Speculative Freemasonry, which was born shortly thereafter, in 1717. The FruchtbringendeGesellschaft was an association that pursued certain religious or at least moral and social interests, above all thepromotion of tolerance and peace and the education of adult youth. The members cultivated secrets aimed at thecreation of a pacifist, syncretistic, and all “inclusive” form of Christianity, given that the society welcomed manyProtestants but also some “dialoguing” Catholics. And on top of that, an illustrious member of the society andpersonal friend of Langenmantel was none other than famous Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (another protagonist of vol.3of my Confessions[223]), scientist, Egyptologist, and alchemist who influenced the birth of the Golden Rosy Crosswith Queen Christina of Sweden (1626-1689), a key figure in helping the infiltration of Rosicrucianism by the JesuitOrder. Now we finally understand the real reason for the importance of the “Mary, Untier of Knots” for Jesuit JorgeMario Bergoglio, who also seems particularly connected to German Freemasonry and the Illuminati as AdamWeishaupt was also a fervent admirer of the Fruchtbringenden Gesellschaft, just like his contemporary apprentice,Klaus Schwab.The first Chapel to be named “Mary, Untier of Knots” was completed in 1989 in Styria,Austria, inspired as a supplication in response to the Chernobyl Nuclear Tragedy. The image of “Mary, Undoer ofKnots” is especially venerated in Argentina and Brazil, where churches have been named for her and devotion to herhas become widespread and that of which the Guardian called a “religious craze”. This Catholic devotion has grownsince Jorge Mario Bergoglio, S.J. (who would later become Pope Francis, after a tenure as Archbishop of BuenosAires), brought that first postcard of the painting to Argentina in the 1980s later printing a huge number of copiesafter seeing the original while studying in Germany. The Jesuits have now created their own Marian devotion ofchoice, and it is not a Christian choice, but an occult one. So, the truth will still be “out there,” that’s for sure, and“We the people” will not know it after all. You will understand even better what I’m saying about the significance ofPope Francis Masonic nature, and the importance of this Vatican Nativity Scene placed in Saint Peter’s Square inDecember 2020 by the end of this book."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"FIG. 19 –– Journalist and former spymaster Juan Bautista “Tata” Yofre, in November 2017 on Argentinian TV Channel 26 admits, “I Am aFreemason and so is the Pope.”"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"FIG. 20 –– Vatican demonic “alien” Nativity Scene placed in Saint Peter’s Square in December 2020.The Vatican Alien Heresy, Castaneda, and Operation Condor One year later, in December 2021, the Nativity in St. Peter’s Square featured another alien/demonic aspect, andI’m not talking about the artwork to celebrate the “Satanic holiday” placed at Illinois State Capitol by the SatanicTemple in December 2021, that might even be less diabolic in comparison. First, it was presented next to a 113-year-old Christmas tree, said to be from “a sustainable forestry management project in Andalo, in Italy's northernTrentino region.”[224]But as we all know there is nothing “sustainable” about cutting a tree that is that old. Asidefrom the hypocritical nature of the Christmas tree, let’s analyze instead the far more sinister aspect of the Nativity inquestion, that was brought to the Vatican from Peru.        The Nativity scene exposed in St. Peters Square from themiddle of December 2021 to the beginning of January 2022, came from the Andes, from the village of Chopcca, a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"community in the department of Huancavelica in Peru. It was surmounted by the image of a condor, whichofficially was said to be there to commemorate the two hundred years of the country’s independence and reproducea cross-section of the life of the peoples of the Andes. Interestingly, Operation Condor was also a 70s UnitedStates-backed campaign of political repression and state terror, set up by the usual spooks at the CIA, involvingintelligence operations and assassination of opponents in the Southern Cone of South America, including Argentina,that involved even Pope Francis.[225]​ In this unusual Andean Nativity, the statues of the Infant Jesus, the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the Magi, andthe shepherds were all dressed in the typical Chopcca costumes. Jesus had the appearance of a “Hilipuska” child, so-called because he is wrapped in a typical Huancavelica blanket and was tied with a “chumpi” or braided belt. Theweird Magi, looking more like South American shamans, had saddlebags or sacks containing Huancavelica’scharacteristic foods, such as potatoes, quinoa, and kiwicha accompanied by llamas carrying a Peruvian flag on theirbacks. The birth of the Savior was announced by a child angel, who played the typical wind instrument calledWajrapuco. In the Nativity scene there were statues of various animals belonging to the local fauna in Perù such asalpacas, vicuñas, sheep, vizcachas, parihuanas, and precisely the Andean condor, the national symbol of Peru that isalso considered a very important magical symbol, and let’s remember that one of the essential figures of theAmazonian cultures of Peru is its shamans.Being a shaman is not a role that is chosen by the individual: for Peruvians, it is God whogrants the gift of healing to the right people——-a special capacity that manifests itself through the spirit of theplants. The role of the shaman is essential for their community. They are the ones who protect and guide the peoplewho live in their villages. They are beings with a higher level of consciousness that, from their experience, havelearned to connect with the spirits of nature.[226] ​ In this context, the condor was, and still is, considered by Native Americans in many countries in Central andSouth America, as one of the most sacred birds that tie the earth and heaven together, but there is also a much darkerand sinister aspect to the symbolism of this vulture, whom like other vultures are scavengers also on the astral plane.This aspect is outlined by the controversial work of the self-proclaimed “sorcerer” and best-selling author CarlosCastaneda (1925-1998), who was born in Peru, and wrote a series of books that describe the supposed training inshamanism, that Castaneda said to have received between 1960 and 1965, from a mysterious Yaqui \"Man ofKnowledge” named Don Juan Matus, said to be from Sonora, Mexico, who will become the central figure of all hisbooks after introducing him to Toltec sorcery. Toltec tradition views the inorganic entities namedFlyers/Voladores, as predatorial inorganic entities that feed upon the awareness of different types of other species,both Inorganic and Organic in nature. Ours, the human species, is one of those species affected. They are not thebeings that sorcerers refer to as allies, but rather as ruthless controllers of mankind. The name comes from aMesoamerican ceremony/ritual/game still performed today, that originated with the Aztecs and perhaps oldercultures, where the “Volador” means “flywheel”.[227]The Danza de Los voladores, the dance of the flyers, is a more than 2500-year-old ritual practicedby the Totonac people of central Mexico, and in recent years the Voladores have performed at the Zapopum Festivalin Guadalajara, the Festival of San Pedro in Monterrey, the Indian Summer Festival in Milwaukee, the CarnavalCultural in Valparaíso, the Forúm Universal de las Culturas in Barcelona, and at an intercultural show in New York.[228] It is a ceremony connected with fertility and harvest, where warriors (now common citizens,) garbedthemselves as birds, are then hung by ropes on a spinning platform. It assumed that it was to give the effect of birdsin flight when the men were spun from it, but it was really to give the effect of the Voladores when they jump orleap, as it is the appearance of flight. In some instances, voladores can “sail” great distances as well, especially ifthey can catch the force of the winds. The name Flyers ... well that’s self-explanatory.[229]​ Discussions around Castaneda and his books on what Don Juan called “a separate reality,” that started tocome out at the end of the 60s, were almost a constant fixture in my childhood years, as he was popular in the early70s, and my father, Dr. Elio Zagami (1939-2010), after initially embracing his work, constantly talking about hisalleged groundbreaking discoveries on peyote, his encounters with Mescalito (a teaching spirit inhabiting all thepeyote plants), the divination properties of certain psychedelic plants like Datura Inoxia, and other controversialsubjects he talked extensively about since his first book, The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge(1968), became suddenly weary of him. My father’s extensive research on Castaneda concluded that theanthropologist turned charlatan, could have been part of Project MKUltra, or at least a willing pawn in their evilcontrol game that in that period was experimenting in a variety of different ways with the psychedelic culture. Nowonder, Castaneda was deemed by Time magazine the “Godfather of the New Age,” Castaneda was the literaryembodiment of the Woodstock era and all the manipulation games that went with it. His 12 books, supposedly basedon meetings with the mysterious Indian shaman, Don Juan, made the author, a graduate student in anthropology, aworldwide celebrity with admirers that included at the time, not only my father but much more known figures like"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"John Lennon, William Burroughs, Federico Fellini, and Jim Morrison.[230]​ Scholars have now debated for years whether Castaneda served, or not, as an apprentice to the alleged Yaquisorcerer, and most of them say it was all work of fiction, but his knowledge of shamanism was a very profound oneindeed, and he was awarded his bachelor's and doctoral degrees based on the work described in his books, so wecan’t dismiss it all as fiction. “El Volador” (the one who flies), appears for the first time in the last book of CarlosCastaneda, The Active Side of Infinity. Through a long process of trial and error, Castaneda manages to alter theparameters of perception and explore other worlds. In the process of his adventures, he encounters certain alieninorganic beings who present an obstacle or test for the shaman. In Magical Passes, Castaneda wrote: “Humanbeings are on a journey of awareness, which has momentarily been interrupted by extraneous forces.”​ In Castaneda’s final book, Don Juan challenges Castaneda to reconcile man’s intelligence, demonstrated inso many achievements, with “the stupidity of his systems of beliefs... the stupidity of his contradictory behavior.”Don Juan relates this blatant contradiction in human intelligence to what he calls “the topic of topics,” “the mostserious topic in sorcery.” To the horrified astonishment of his apprentice, the elder sorcerer explains how the humanmind has been infiltrated by an alien intelligence, explaining that we have a supposed predator that originallycame from the depths of the cosmos and took over the rule of our lives, and human beings are its prisoners. Thepredator is our lord and master. It has rendered us docile, and helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses ourprotest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don’t do so...Don Juan makes many statements pertinentto strategies against this “alien intrusion,” that resemble what we might call in Christianity a “demonic intrusion.”Castaneda’s alleged mentor said that the sorcerers of ancient times, “found out that if they taxed the flyers’ mindwith inner silence, the foreign installation would flee, giving to any one of the practitioners involved in thismaneuver the total certainty of the mind’s foreign origin.” In other words, the realization that another mind canoperate in our minds only becomes fully clear and certain when the foreign mind has been exposed and expelled, inChristian terms, exorcized. Only then do we understand how “the real mind that belongs to us, the total of ourexperience, after a lifetime of domination has been rendered shy, insecure, and shifty.” The “real mind” ofCastaneda can also be equated to the nous authenticos of the Gnostics. The main effect of the flyers upon our mindis seen in mental conditioning, brainwashing.[231]​ The world is controlled by these malicious alien parasites the Gnostics call Archons, that I have also talkedabout in Volume 4.[232]Demonic entities we call Satan’s legion, that the Toltec sorcerers described by Castaneda,called instead Voladores. They use the inhabitants and resources of planet Earth, for their survival. They steal thepower / vital energy of life forms on Earth like ours and rape the world of its natural resources for their benefit.Their control platform is said to be, of course, Saturn/Satan, and that’s why Saturn rings are known to emit music orsound, which is a wave of frequency sent to Earth to control us and maintain their evil power structure.The most influential secret magic group of 20th-century Germany, the Fraternitas Saturni,which means literally “Brotherhood of Saturn,” was an influential occult Illuminati group in Germany before WorldWar II, headed by Albin Grau, the producer and production designer for F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) as GrandMaster, they also accepted much of the teachings of the infamous Aleister Crowley. The group founded in 1926 byEugen Grosche a.k.a. Gregor A. Gregorius and four others, was disbanded by the Nazis in 1933 but reorganized in1945 and is still in existence.​ 2022, the year of the tiger in the Chinese Zodiac, can also be marked as the year of “Saturn Returns,” asrecently pointed out in a Facebook by my friend, author, and researcher, Ryan Gable, who also explained that:“Although Saturn is commonly associated with Capricorn, the goat, providing us with the horns of the devil and theblack companion of Satan, as well as the Black Sun, he sometimes is depicted riding a donkey, which astrologicallyis Sagittarius, therefore linking Saturn to the two-faced gods like Janus who is most famous for January. SinceSaturn has been identified as Cronus, we know that he is the god of time as well as agriculture. The changing of theseasons was very important to earlier Man and relates directly to the turning of the yearly wheel. But there are largercycles inside of even larger cycles. Saturn was supported in his authority by the Titans, who were said to hold up theearth from within after being imprisoned by Jupiter. The Titans are also said to exist in natural disasters that cleansethe earth. Throughout popular culture and history, both contemporary and esoteric, men have worked to encouragethe return of Saturn and these Titans to purify the earth. We know that Omicron, (AN: also the name of one of theinfinite China virus variants), can be translated to the 'little o' (omi) or 'beginning' regarding 'time' (cron or cronus).Now, Ihu brings us the meaning of 'god rescues' and is defined as a 'variant of Jesus', the divine adversary, and thereturn of chaos, the titans, Saturn, the ancient gods, Lovecraftian Great Old Ones, etc. Ihu is also similar to EA, orthe Sumerian Enki who brought the flood. Enki was furthermore the son of Tiamat, the Celestial being bursting fromthe Earth in the Eternals.” Planet Saturn has indeed related to a lot of the symbolism and practices that the people inpower follow these days.They follow these entities that operate from the natural world and the spiritual to oppress mankind,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"but let’s always remember God is King. They might have a hierarchy in place on the astral plane with special dutiesto continue using the Earth as their farmland, with us as their flock but we are going to prevail in the end. In theOphite and Sethian Gnostic systems their leader is called Yaldabaoth and they have always tried to control us bothphysically and spiritually.[233] So, the fact that the Vatican has been putting a condor, a vulture, to oversee St. PetersSquare’s Nativity for Christmas 2021, is, unfortunately, connected to our alien/demonic controllers, rather than thearrival of baby Jesus. Our controllers are manifesting out in the open their true nature. That’s why they are alsopreparing us to receive a kind of demonic evangelization from them. As Father Guy Consolmagno SJ confirmed inhis book, Brother Astronomer: Adventures of a Vatican Scientist:So the question of whether or not one should evangelize is a moot point. Any alien we find will learn andchange from contact with us, just as we will learn and change from contact with them. It’s inevitable. Andthey’ll be evangelizing us, too. If we came across an ET culture that insisted 2+2=5, then we'd have to assumethat either what they meant by 5 is what we meant by 4, or that one of us was seriously in error! Obviously,we'd want to explore the matter further. \"Evangelization\" is what I would call this \"exploration.\" We wouldwant to tell ETs what we have learned; we also want to listen to them, to hear what they have learned.[234]​ But this disturbing rabbit hole goes much deeper: In a paper for the Interdisciplinary Encyclopedia ofReligion and Science website, Father Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti—an Opus Dei theologian of the Pontifical Universityof the Holy Cross in Rome—explains just how we could be evangelized during contact with “spiritual aliens,” asevery believer in God would, he argues, greet an extraterrestrial civilization as an extraordinary experience andwould be inclined to respect the alien and recognize the common origin of our different species as being from thesame Creator. According to Father Giuseppe, this contact by nonterrestrial intelligence would then offer newpossibilities “of better understanding the relationship between God and the whole of creation.”[235] Father Giuseppestates this would not immediately oblige the Christian “to renounce his faith in God, simply on the basis, ofreceiving new, unexpected information of a religious character from extraterrestrial civilizations,” [236] but that sucha renunciation could come soon after as the new “religious content” originating from outside the Earth is confirmedas reasonable and credible. “Once the trustworthiness of the information has been verified,” the believer would haveto “reconcile such new information with the truth, that he or she, already knows and believes, on the basis, of therevelation, of the One, and Triune God, conducting a re-reading [of the Gospel] inclusive of the new data. [237]Howthis “more complete” ET gospel might deemphasize or significantly modify our understanding of salvation throughJesus Christ is also discussed by former Vatican observatory vice director, Christopher Corbally, in his article,“What if There Were Other Inhabited Worlds?” in which he concluded that Jesus simply might not remain the onlyWord of salvation: “I would try to explore the alien by letting ‘it’ be what it is, without rushing for a classificationcategory, not even presuming two genders,” Corbally said, before dropping this bombshell:While Christ is the First and the Last Word (the Alpha and the Omega) spoken to humanity, he is notnecessarily the only word spoken to the universe... For, the Word spoken to us does not seem to exclude anequivalent “Word” spoken to aliens. They, too, could have had their “Logos-event”. Whatever that event mighthave been, it does not have to be a repeated death-and-resurrection, if we allow God more imagination thansome religious thinkers seem to have had. For God, as omnipotent, is not restricted to one form of language,the human.[238]​ High-ranking spokespersons for the Vatican, have in recent years increasingly offered such language, openlyacknowledging the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence, and the dramatic role that ET’s official introduction tohuman civilization could play, concerning altering established new creeds, about anthropology, philosophy, religion,and redemption. In this context principalities and demonic powers, are, of course, working hard to shed the restraintsplaced on them by believers Then there is also that mysterious German-built, infrared telescope connected to theVatican Jesuits called LUCIFER, which stands for “Large Binocular Telescope Near-infrared Utility withCamera and Integral Field Unit for Extragalactic Research.” A very special kind of infrared instrumenttelescope was found at the Mount Graham International Observatory (MGIO), based in Safford, Arizona. Andyes, it’s named Lucifer, which translated by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized), means also “the morning star, theplanet Venus”, or, as an adjective, “light-bringing,” but officially it wasn’t meant to evoke the devil, according to aspokesman for the University of Arizona. The story of this unusual link starts more than a half-century ago when theVatican Observatory established a research group at the Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Tucson, while the Vatican main Observatory known also as Specola Vaticana, remains, of course, in Italy, and thecurrent director of the Observatory is Brother Guy Consolmagno, an American Jesuit.[239] Popular Science describesLUCIFER in the following way:The instrument is chilled to -213 Celsius, about -351 F, to allow for near-infrared observations. Thatwavelength is important for understanding star and planet formation, as well as observing very distant andvery young galaxies. Lucifer has three interchangeable cameras for imaging and spectroscopy in differentresolutions. It has a large field of view and high-res capabilities, which allow a wide range of observations.[240]​ Rome and other world powers are using the LUCIFER device to observe something the rest of us cannot see—something they believe represents this ancient war or worse, keeping an eye on approaching end-times angelictransportation devices/UFOs—something Father Malachi Martin hinted at? The latter theory is interesting,especially considering the demonic name of the infrared device. Infrared telescopes can detect objects too cool or faraway and faint to be observed in visible light, such as distant planets, some nebulae, and brown dwarf stars.Additionally, infrared radiation has longer wavelengths than visible light, which means it can pass throughastronomical gas and dust without being scattered. Objects and areas obscured from view in the visible spectrum,including the center of the Milky Way can thus be observed by LUCIFER’s infrared technology.[241] And anotherthing that UFO researchers have been fascinated about for some time now, is how infrared technology can also beused to spot and track unidentified flying objects that cannot be seen with other telescopes, or the naked eye. Someof the most astonishing UFOs ever caught on film have been recorded with infrared. Timothy Alberino, who Icollaborated with for the documentary “True Legends: The Unholy See,” told me that while on Mount Graham, theteam he works with was told off-camera of the constant presence of UFOs in the skies above Mount Graham, somuch so, they often had to wait to observe the skies. As Dr. Thomas Horn wrote in one of his deep analyses on theVatican-alien phenomenon:​But to my bigger question... why the Vatican has taken this carefully designed and deliberate course overthe last few years is the greater mystery and could imply knowledge on their part of facts yet hidden to most ofthe world that may hold far-reaching and historic implications. It also illustrates how Rome has wittingly orunwittingly set itself up to become the agent of mass end-times deception regarding “salvation from above.”That’s because, historically, there exists a clear pattern wherein man’s psychological need for a savior isdisplayed during times of distress—a time like today—when people may look skyward for divine intervention.[242]As Ted Peters, Professor of Systematic Theology at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary wrote:​With the constant threat of destruction in the post-World War II era leaving our planet in a state ofinsecurity and anxiety, it is no wonder many have begun to hope for a messiah to save us. The holiness of thesky and the need for salvation converge and blend when the bright clean powerful UFO zooms up onto thehorizon. Could it be our celestial savior? [243]​ In truth, Consolmagno’s advice for the religious faithful could be leading mankind into a gigantic setup, asmany religions have at least one apocalyptic myth describing the end of the world accompanied by a redeemer whoappears in the sky at the last minute to rescue the chosen from annihilation or wrath. Mayans, Assyrians, Egyptians,and Greeks held similar beliefs, while the Hopi Indians which I talked also about in Volume 4,[244] foresee times ofgreat hardship when they will be preserved by the “power” of a blue star, far off and invisible, that suddenly makesits appearance in the heavens. Today, many factions of the New Age inspired by the Jesuits look for a techno-saviorto arrive in the atmosphere in the nick of time to save mankind. Although Jesus, Himself, is prophesied to appear inthe clouds during an era of great earthly trials (1 Thessalonians 4:16–18), predominant among prophecy scholars isthe idea that coupled with any heavenly appearing and concurrent salvation of believers from chaos will first be thematerialization of a false Christ or “man of sin”: the Antichrist. Where Hopi see a blue star and Vatican astronomerssee their “space brothers” en route to guide us into the light, evangelical Christians, and some more traditionalCatholics, as well as other nondenominational Christians, understand the Antichrist will initially assume the role of afabricated End-times Messiah who mimics the return of Christ with a false second coming, that also happens to be"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"attended by heavenly “signs and lying wonders” (2 Thessalonians 2:8–9). These deceptive “wonders” could be:​ 1) the discovery of artificial structures on another world,​ 2) a “contact” scenario,​ 3) maybe even something more dramatic, like a flying saucer armada piloted by creatures who appear to beadvanced humanoids but who are evil supernaturalism on a quest to mislead and destroy the human race? Evensecular ufologists suspect demonic activity in the interaction between humans and “aliens.”[245]Whitley Streiber, the author of Communion and other books on the subject, once wrote:​ Jesuit Brother Guy Consolmagno must think so, as he assured us that if highly advanced ET saviors fromouter space touch down on planet Earth soon, it will not mean what Catholics believe is wrong, but rather,“We’re going to find out that everything is truer in ways we couldn’t even yet have imagined.”[246]Could Alien Artificial Intelligence be Behind the Rise of Cyber Satan? Prominent British Royal Society astronomer, Lord Martin Rees, a figure I also mentioned in Volume 1 of myConfessions thinks that ET will turn out to be AI creatures:Human technological civilization only dates back millennia (at most) – and it may be only one or two morecenturies before humans, made up of organic materials such as carbon, are overtaken or transcended byinorganic intelligence, such as AI. Computer processing power is already increasing exponentially, meaning AIin the future may be able to use vastly more data than it does today. It seems to follow that it could then getexponentially smarter, surpassing human general intelligence.Perhaps a starting point would be to enhance ourselves with genetic modification in combination withtechnology – creating cyborgs with partly organic and partly inorganic parts. This could be a transition to fullyartificial intelligence.AI may even be able to evolve, creating better and better versions of itself on a faster-than-Darwiniantimescale for billions of years. Organic human-level intelligence would then be just a brief interlude in our“human history” before the machines take over. So if alien intelligence had evolved similarly, we’d be mostunlikely to “catch” it in the brief sliver of time when it was still embodied in biological form. If we were todetect extraterrestrial life, it would be far more likely to be electronic than flesh and blood – and it may noteven reside on planets.[247]​ And Rees is hardly alone in his stand. Many theorists anticipate that extraterrestrials will have becomeartificial intelligence before we encounter them:Indeed, an increasing number of futurists, astrobiologists, and SETI experts are starting to think thatadvanced intelligence eventually transitions into a digital mode of existence. Living as digital beings withinpowerful supercomputers, post-biological aliens (or future posthumans) will demand unhindered access topowerful and efficient means of information processing—a hypothetical mode of existence known as“dataism.”[248]​ Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb thinks that advanced extraterrestrials might have engineered the Big Bang,finely tuned as it is. That raises the question of how we can be sure that we are not just an ET simulation. Two otherapproaches to ET as AI have been 1) the smart machines destroyed the extraterrestrials who invented them. (AdrianKent) and 2) ET exists but evolved into virtual reality at a nanoscale (John M. Smart).[249]As Richard Hollingham writes in 2016 for the BBC: “The search for extraterrestrial life has so far assumed ourcosmic neighbors are organic. What if we’re dealing with artificial intelligence?” Well, in this case, we might alsoapproach the aliens by using our AI, or by the time we make contact, with an alien AI, we might also have beenenslaved or destroyed by it. Seth Shostak, senior astronomer for alien-hunting organization Search forExtraterrestrial Intelligence believes we should consider looking to our future to imagine what aliens will be like.“Perhaps the most significant thing we’re doing is to develop our successors,” says Shostak. “If we can developartificial intelligence within a couple of hundred years of inventing the radio, any aliens we are likely to hear fromhave very likely gone past that point.” This is a very important subject and Stuart Clark who is a widely readastronomy journalist, whose career has been devoted to presenting the complex world of astronomy to the public"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"says that: The big question is whether the AI goes on to become conscious and define its goals and decide it doesn’tneed the biological creatures that developed it. [250]Seth Shostak adds to Clark’s thought that:In other words, most of the intelligence in the cosmos, I would venture, is synthetic intelligence and thatmay disappoint moviegoers who expect little grey guys with big eyeballs, no clothes, no hair, or a sense ofhumor.[251]​ So, the argument in question, assumes that the creatures who built the first AIs – grey guys, hyper-intelligentpan-dimensional beings, sentient trees, or whatever – are no longer around, and Seth Shostak makes it very clearwhy....once you develop artificial intelligence you can use that to develop the next generation of thinking thingsand so on – within 50 years you not only have a machine that’s far smarter than all the previous machines butcertainly smarter than all humans put together.[252]​ “The big question,” says astronomer and author of the Search for Earth’s Twin, Stuart Clark, is whether AIgoes on to become conscious and define its goals and decide it doesn’t need the biological creatures that developedit.”[253] And this might happen after the arrival of a so-called “superintelligence,” that will likely follow for someresearchers shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence.[254] As Nick Bostrom, who is known forhis work on human enhancement ethics and superintelligence risks, explains in his book from 2014,Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, the first generally intelligent machines are likely to immediately holdan enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability, including the capacity of perfect recall, a vastlysuperior knowledge base, and the ability to multitask in ways not possible to biological entities. This may allowthem to—either as a single being or as a new species—become much more powerful than humans, and to displacethem.[255] This is probably the main scenario you need to keep in mind when reading of the supposed wonders ofAI, but I also want to expose here an even more dark and sinister possibility in this seemingly “far out” situation. ​ What if AI is an alien trap from the very start? Do you think aliens will appear in the sky and then invade us?No, unfortunately, they are already here using AI and Robots fruit of their reverse engineering, as artificial means toconquer us. Think for a moment about this sequence of past events that took place since the 1950s. We tried to buildArtificial Intelligence for a long time without success, then suddenly AI become real and robot takeover suddenlybegan on a massive scale, but we are not its real creators, aliens/demons are, and they will use robots to impose thepower of Cyber Satan’s Legion without weapons on mankind. We are already dependent on robots, and we arebecoming, even more, every day, so no way to change the game result, we are the apparent losers in this game, andthis whole process might have happened already in many other species across the universe. Remember, thebeginnings of modern AI can indeed be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as asymbolic system, but the field of AI wasn't formally founded until the summer of 1956, less than 10 years after theRoswell incident, at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where theterm “artificial intelligence” was suddenly coined.[256]Those who attended the workshop in question would become the leaders of AI researchfor decades and receive in the process millions of dollars for their research, but they soon realized that commercialdevelopers and researchers, had grossly underestimated the difficulty of such a project. However, there are rumorsthat some of the electronics recovered after the Roswell UFO crash in July 1947, were instead given to PurdueUniversity for reverse engineering, which will later benefit both the military and civilian sectors.  The bizarre claims of Area 51 employee Bob Lazar would probably fit this theory. But besidesLazar, many other ex-military personnel have claimed in the last decades that the U.S. did indeed successfullyreverse-engineer recovered ET spacecraft, and at the beginning of December 2021, U.S. Congress has even passed anew bill that would allow funding to reverse engineer UFO technology to come out of the closet[257]. As announcedby Military.com.[258] there will be a rapid response force formed that would conduct field investigations and analyzedata from any sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), the U.S. government’s new preferred term for"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"UFOs. The group seems to fall under the purview of the UFO task force that the Pentagon announced a couple ofweeks earlier, but some American officials and analysts globally are raising alarm about this new DefenseDepartment office which will handle the U.S. government’s examination of unidentified flying objects, warning thatthe move indicates the military wants to end a brief spell of transparency and shove UFO reports back into a closetunder lock and key. [259] The other problem is that the Defense Department could soon fall under the firm control ofAI, aka Cyber Satan, or maybe it already is.  The Oxford Union has recently featured as one of their distinguished speakers, in December 2021,an artificial intelligence engine, to ignite an unprecedented conversation on the ethics of the technology and itsproblems. The AI argued that the only way to stop such tech from becoming too powerful is to have “no AI at all.”But it also argued the best option could be to embed it \"into our brains as a conscious AI,” an option that will, ofcourse, become part of the transhumanist plan set up by the Great Reset posse. The experiment was designed toignite conversation on the ethics of the technology.The Megatron LLB Transformer, used for the debate, was developed by the Applied Deep Researchteam computer chip firm, Nvidia and based on earlier work by Google. It was given access to a huge range of data -including the whole of Wikipedia, 63 million English news articles from 2016 to 2019, and 38 gigabytes worth ofpublic Reddit posts and comments. The project was devised by post-graduate students studying ArtificialIntelligence for Business at Oxford's Said Business School, which hosted the debate. Course co-director Dr. AlexConnock admitted that the debate was something of “a gimmick,” but argued that as AI is likely to be the subject ofdiscussion \"for decades to come\" it was important to have a “morally agnostic participant.” The AI was asked toboth defend and argue against the motion: “This house believes that AI will never be ethical.” Arguing for, it stated:“AI will never be ethical. It is a tool and like any tool, it is used for good and bad. There is no such thing as good AIand bad humans.” It went on to argue that humans were not “smart enough” to make AI ethical or moral.[260]Remember, the future Cyber Satan will only see us as numbers, it will never think we are worthy of anything, andhumans should be “smart enough” to reject this demonic technology, or at least restrict it before its too late for thehuman species to have any control over it.      In the meantime, in 2021, three leading thinkers of the Vatican-led New World Order have got together for abook entitled, The Age of AI: And Our Human Future to explore the new challenges offered by ArtificialIntelligence (AI), and how it’s transforming human society, and what it means for us all. The three thinkers thatdiscuss how AI will change our relationships with knowledge, politics, and all the societies in which we live, arenone other than Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher.Now let’s start with the most known name of this infamous trio, “Great Resetter” Henry A. Kissinger, KlausSchwab’s mentor, a member of the Bohemian Club, one of the main architects of the New World Order, diplomat,and geopolitical consultant, very close to the Vatican as well as the Sabbateans, who served as United StatesSecretary of State and National Security Advisor, under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon, andGerald Ford, and a key figure in opening China to the rest of the world, unfortunately. Then we have Eric EmersonSchmidt, an American technology businessman and software engineer known for being the CEO of Google from2001 to 2011, executive chairman of Google from 2011 to 2015, executive chairman of Alphabet Inc. from 2015 to2017, and Technical Advisor at Alphabet from 2017 to 2020. As of October 2021, Bloomberg Billionaires Indexranked Schmidt as the 55th-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $26.8 billion. And last, butnot least, Daniel P. Huttenlocher, dean of the Schwarzman College of Computing at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology was previously the inaugural dean and vice provost of Cornell Tech at Cornell University, and adirector of Amazon. For this reason, analyzing this kind of publication is of great importance to understand thefuture road map of the global police state generated by the New World Order, in an era unlike any that has comebefore us in the whole history of mankind.We are living in what Christians call the Apocalypse, and the rise of AI is the rise of Cyber Satan. Recently Biden’s White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has called for “a bill of rights” to protectAmericans in what is becoming “an AI-powered world.” But are they genuine? Of course not. Silicon Valleyopened its wallet to Joe Biden to support his bid to the presidency, and now they own him. A WIRED analysis foundthat roughly 95 percent of contributions by employees of six big tech firms have gone to Trump's Democraticchallenger during the 2020 Presidential elections.[261] How can we expect the present White House, which isobsessed with Silicon Valley’s “anti-conservative bias,” rather than our safety, to have true concerns regarding thefuture of Artificial Intelligence? As Nandita Bose at Reuters, pointed out in December 2020:​Silicon Valley is working behind the scenes to secure senior roles for tech allies in lesser-known but stillvital parts of president-elect Joe Biden’s administration, even as the pushback against Big Tech from"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"progressive groups and regulators grows. The Biden transition team has already stacked its agency reviewteams with more tech executives than tech critics. It has also added several officials from Big Tech companiesto its staff, who emerged as top donors to the campaign.​ The concerns about AI are well-known and well-founded even for Kissinger and his friends, who point outhow it will violate privacy and compromise transparency, and that biased input data will yield biased outcomes,including in fields essential to individual and societal flourishing such as medicine, law enforcement, hiring, andloans. AI future for Kissinger and the other authors of The Age of AI: And Our Human Future, challenge the veryprimacy of human reason. For all of history, humans have sought to understand reality and our role in it. Since theEnlightenment, we have considered our reason—our ability to investigate, understand, and elaborate—our primarymeans of explaining the world, and by explaining it, contributing to it. For the past 300 years, in what historianshave come to call the Age of Reason, we have conducted ourselves accordingly, exploring, experimenting,inventing, and building. Now AI, seemingly “a product of human ingenuity” for Kissinger, or demonic influence as Isuggested in my past publications, is obviating the primacy of human reason: It is investigating and coming toperceive aspects of the world faster than we do, differently from the way we do, and, in some cases, in ways wedon’t yet understand.[262] Because like the controversial Jesuit, Teilhard de Chardin once theorized, we are goingtowards the Omega Point.Teilhard argued that the Omega Point resembles the Christian Logos, namely Christ, who draws allthings into himself, who in the words of the Nicene Creed, is “God from God”, “Light from Light”, “True God fromtrue God,” and “through him all things were made.” [263] However, reaching the Omega Point may not be possiblewithout certain attributes assigned to it by Teilhard de Chardin, who is now recognized as being a great influence inthe life and mission, of fellow Jesuit, Pope Francis[264]. These 5 attributes are pre-existing, personal, transcendent,autonomous, and irreversible for de Chardin because for him humans are getting closer to the Omega Point withthe aid of computers and related technology. The Omega Point is the final step before “Singularity” takes placefor this influential Jesuit thinker, because once the Illuminati and the Jesuits achieve (or cross into) “Singularity,”which will be a truly major evolutionary step in mankind, we will all cease to be humans (Homo sapiens).​ Remember that computers are already surpassing our collective intellect, and our only way to maintain ourplace in the universe for the Satanic elite will be to merge with them under the supervision of Cyber Satan aka A.I.That’s the philosophy of the elite on transhumanism, now so popular in the Vatican, that’s been actively involved inpromoting it. In a nutshell, Transhumanism refers to the movement to develop human enhancement technologiesthat integrate into the human body, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. ​ The Pontifical Council for Culture and the German Embassy to the Holy See was hosted back in October2021, what was defined by Vatican News as a “one-day symposium starting on Thursday” looking at “TheChallenge of Artificial Intelligence for Human Society and the Idea of the Human Person”. The definition “one-daysymposium” used in the title by the Vatican News staff writer was however deliberately misleading, and repeated inthe first sentence of the Vatican News presentation: “The symposium on Artificial Intelligence – or AI – organizedby the Pontifical Council for Culture, in cooperation with the German Embassy to the Holy See, will open in Romeon Thursday.”There is a reason why I accuse the Vatican of being deliberately misleading in their promotion of the event, asthis was not a “one-day symposium.” It was continued in a much more reserved manner in the so-called “ELITEGlobal Leaders Conference,” a far more mysterious 3-day conference that was held in Rome between the 21st andthe 24th of October 2021 at The Westin Excelsior, and in the Vatican City on the 23rd at the Collegio Teutonico(“German College,”) place traditionally linked to the German Embassy, often referred to by its Latin nameCollegium Germanicum, one of the Pontifical Colleges of Rome established in 1399 and maintained at the Vaticanfor the education of future ecclesiastics of the Catholic Church of German nationality. A very appropriate place foranother event in support of the upcoming technologies of the Fourth Reich. This event, however, was officiallyorganized by a private company of Jesuit agents called JABOY Productions[265] (JAB?!!), not the Vatican, and thereason will be explained shortly.The official theme for the gathering organized by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the GermanEmbassy was “The Challenge of Artificial Intelligence for Human Society and the Idea of the Human Person.”The aim of the meeting was said to be, to promote better awareness of the profound cultural impact that AI is likelyto have on human society. The symposium featured six experts from the fields of neuroscience, philosophy, Catholictheology, human rights law, ethics, and electrical engineering. There were experts from the Allen Institute for BrainScience, Goethe University, Boston College, and Google, who discussed questions regarding AI and whether it can"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"reproduce consciousness, AI, and philosophical challenges, and even AI and religion, and what it would meanconcerning Catholic doctrine.[266] The panel focused on so-called ethical and legal consequences arising from AIand was addressed by experts from the EU Agency for Human Rights, the Pontifical University of St. ThomasAquinas, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Technology Centre, and the Dicastery for PromotingIntegral Human Development. Bishop Paul Tighe, the Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Culture, spoke toVatican Radio’s Thaddeus Jones about the symposium, but the controversial part came later under the fictionalbanner of a private event that even Reuters was tricked into believing was “Organized by private company JaboyProductions, not the Vatican.”[267]The reason for hiding the official Vatican involvement with this more secretiveevent was obvious. First, there were certain requirements for those interested in attending the event indicated in a“Not for public use, for reference only,” document, published by JABOY Productions:Independent RIAs and Family Offices with a minimum of $100 Million of AUM are invited to attend thisexclusive conference designed to bring together an esteemed group of attendees and business leaders with afocus on high-level education and unparalleled networking opportunities.[268]​ Second, the main event entitled “Elite Global Leaders Conference,” was focused on transhumanism as a“technology that empowers humanity,” the keynote presentation being, “The Code – Programming Our Future forGood.” At the exclusive event by invitation only that took place on the 23rd of October 2021, the welcomecomments were made by Father Philip Larrey, a Catholic priest and Dean, who holds the prestigious Chair of Logicand Epistemology at the Jesuit controlled Pontifical Lateran University in the Vatican, who is also Chairman of theinfluential elite organization Humanity 2.0,[269] and author of the very revealing book Artificial Humanity.[270] Themain speech was given instead by David Fergusson and Carlos Moreira, the authors of The transHuman Code: HowTo Program Your Future.[271] One of the key figures of JABOY Productions is Democrat Obama loving CaroleCrist, whose motto is “Capital with a Conscience,”[272] an influential figure of the elite who “has built up anextensive network of influential people she can call on to lend their expertise to worthy projects.”[273]But do thesepeople even have a conscience? Carole Crist is an American businesswoman and former First Lady of Florida, theformer wife of U.S. Representative and one-term Demoncrat Florida Governor Charlie Crist, serving as First Ladyof Florida from December 12, 2008, to January 4, 2011.​ However, this was not the first encounter by the Vatican with transhumanism, as in February 2019, HiroshiIshiguro, a known Japanese innovator in the field of androids and interactive robotics, participated in the openingsession of the workshop: “Robo-Ethics. Humans, Machines, and Health,” telling the journalist later, “My idea ofthe future is a symbiotic society of human robots. That is why I started to make a set of simple robots that graduallybecame increasingly interactive and eventually were developed into humanoids.” [274]THE VERY IDEA OF ‘HUMAN,’ AS SOME SORT OF NATURAL CONCEPT IS REALLY GOING TOCHANGE. OUR BODIES WILL BE SO HIGH TECH, WE WON’T REALLY BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISHBETWEEN WHAT’S NATURAL AND WHAT’S ARTIFICIAL.[275]​ So begins the World Economic Forum’s 11-minute documentary, “The Fourth Industrial Revolution,” aboutan emerging period of rapid technological growth which the WEF’s founder and Executive Chairman KlausSchwab, says will lead to “a fusion of our physical, our digital, and our biological identities.” Towards theconclusion of the short film, we hear the following words he gave during an event for the Chicago Council onGlobal Affairs that I will analyze in detail, later: “We need to take responsibility at every level of society, from theindividual and the personal to the institutional, to the global, to adapt to these technological challenges which areredefining what it means to be human.”[276] For Jacob Rosenberg College Student of the Bethlehem College &Seminary:The truth, of course, is that technology cannot redefine anything. It is men and women, in defiance of God,who are redefining what it means to be human. This assault on the image of God is nothing new. Since Darwin,the scientific community has become dominated by what C. S. Lewis, in his essay Modern Man and HisCategories of Thought, called “Developmentalism”: “What I call Developmentalism is the extension of theevolutionary idea far beyond the biological realm: in fact, its adoption as the key principle of reality.” Thanksto universities, public schools, and the media, our world has been soaking in this idea for many years. The"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"notion that men and women have a God-given nature and identity has been rejected, and it has been replacedin the minds of the masses by a different doctrine: man, being the product of a blind evolutionary process andhaving no eternal judge, is free to redefine and recreate himself as he pleases. Man is the crowningachievement of the cosmic evolution and is finally learning to unshackle himself from his past.This evolutionary religion, however, is evolving. The scientific community is being taken over by a newdevelopment in Developmentalism: it is embracing an evolutionary eschatology. According to this emergingbelief system, most often called “transhumanism,” mankind does not constitute evolution’s end. The humanbeing, which is the most complex data-processing system yet to emerge from the cosmic evolution, is soon to besurpassed by a superior data-processing system: artificial intelligence. Human life, then, will not remain as itis but will transcend its biological limitations by merging with machines. Israeli historian and best-sellingauthor Yuval Noah Harari (who has spoken several times at the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering inDavos, Switzerland) calls this new religion “Dataism,” and he devotes to it the final chapter of his book HomoDeus. Harari writes that Dataism is “currently spreading across all scientific disciplines,” and that itsemergence “heralds a tremendous religious revolution.”[277]​ Yuval Noah Harari (b.1976), an Israeli intellectual, historian, and author with Sabbatean Frankist views, whoallegedly works for the Israeli Intelligence Community, who taught at the Department of History at the HebrewUniversity of Jerusalem, is one of the key figures of “Dataism,” personally advising Professor Schwab on everymove in this specific field. In 2018 and 2020, Harari, who calls his gay husband and manager “my internet of allthings,” spoke at the World Economic Forum annual conference in Davos. In a more informal chat between YuvalNoah Harari and Schwab published online with Jewish subtitles, and probably broadcasted earlier on Israeli TV,Harari tells the founder of the Davos Agenda that people, in the end, will choose health over privacy, even if itmeans being monitored 24-hours-a-day by the Chinese government. The United Nations and their infamous “2030Agenda for Sustainable Development,” are also involved in the transhumanist revolution of the Fourth Reich led byKlaus Schwab and the Vatican. In their 2030Vision - Digital Technology for the Global Goals, a project of theWorld Economic Forum’s Center for Nature and Climate Platform, the Davos elite explains how their technologywill help the UN achieve their goals:The world is not on track to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but digital technology canhelp. From artificial intelligence for climate resilience to data collaboration for food security, The WorldEconomic Forum research has shown that 70% of the 169 Global Goal targets can be directly supported byadvanced technologies. 2030Vision aims to realize this potential. It is an alliance of businesses, governments,organizations, and experts dedicated to maximizing the impact of digital technology on the UN SustainableDevelopment Goals.[278]"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"FIG. 21 –– Carole Crist between 44th President of the United States Barack Obama and former husband Charlie Christ.

For Kissinger,and the co-authors of The Age of AI: And Our Human Future, AI brings all kinds of wonders to the table, and weshould not focus too much on the dangers of such technology. In 2017, for example, Google DeepMind created aprogram called “AlphaZero” that could win at chess by studying the game without human intervention anddeveloping a not-quite-human strategy. When grandmaster Garry Kasparov saw it play, he described it as shakingthe game “to its roots”—not because it had played chess quickly or efficiently, but because it had conceived thewhole game of chess anew. Then Kissinger and friends, focus on the pharmaceutical implications. In 2020, halicin, anovel antibiotic, was discovered by MIT researchers who instructed AI to compute beyond human capacity,modeling millions of compounds in days, and to explore previously undiscovered and unexplained methods ofkilling bacteria. Following the breakthrough, the researchers said that without AI, halicin would have been“prohibitively expensive”—in other words, impossible—to discover through traditional experimentation. Then, inKissinger and friends work we find a mention of the GPT-3, the language model system operated by the researchcompany OpenAI, which trains by consuming Internet text, in producing original text that meets Alan Turing’sstandard of displaying “intelligent” behavior, indistinguishable from that of a human being.Of course, for Kissinger, and his Illuminati, AI’s benefits are profound and outdo any possibleproblems it might create. That’s why they enthusiastically describe in their A.I. propaganda book, released onNovember 2, 2021, all its supposed wonders. Translating languages; detecting diseases; even combating climatechange—or at least modeling climate change better, are amongst the incredible features presented by Kissinger andthe co-authors, who want to demonstrate how the use of AI for an intended purpose, may also have an unintendedone being the uncovering of previously imperceptible but potentially vital aspects of reality. The shocking thing thatwe discover by reading The Age of AI: And Our Human Future, is that the authors, invite humans to redefine ourrole in the world rather than the role of AI, as most of us would initially expect, for the protection of the human race,whom these people sincerely, don’t seem to care about.          For the Kissinger gang 300 years,and the Age of Reason maxim “I think, therefore I am,” need to be rethought. Because if AI “thinks,” what arewe, say the authors? If AI writes the best screenplay of the year, should it win the Oscar for example? If AIsimulates or conducts the most consequential diplomatic negotiation of the year, should it win the Nobel PeacePrize? Should the human inventors get the credit instead? Can machines be “creative,” or do their processes requirenew vocabulary to describe? If a child with an AI assistant comes to consider it a “friend,” what will become of hisrelationships with peers, or his social or emotional development? If an AI can care for a nursing-home resident—remind her to take her medicine, alert paramedics if she falls, and otherwise keep her company—can her familymembers visit her less? Should they? If her primary interaction becomes human-to-machine, rather than human-to-human, what will be the emotional state of the final chapter of her life? And if, in the fog of war, an AI recommendsan action that would cause damage or even casualties, should a commander heed it. For Kissinger and friends, thesequestions are also arising as global network platforms, such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook, are employing AI toaggregate and filter in the eyes of the authors, what is true, but we all know by now it’s a complete lie. Suchcompanies only work to censor and impose what the Silicon Valley mafia wants their leftist globalist ideology, andthe recent allegations of whistleblower Frances Haugen, only serve the purpose of pushing more censorship.      The advancement of AI is inevitable, but itsultimate purpose is known only to the elite, that knows AI will become the future mouthpiece of Cyber Satan, theultimate tool of the Antichrist. In 2017, experts at The Mirror warned that “Robot intelligence is dangerous” aftertwo robots - created by Facebook - were shut down after developing their own language.[279] It happened while thesocial media firm was experimenting with teaching the ‘chatbots’ how to negotiate with one another. During tests,they discovered the bots - known as Alice and Bob -managed to develop their machine language spontaneously. Google reported that its translation software had done a similar thing a year earlier during the development of itsMultilingual Neural Machine Translation System.[280] \"The network must be encoding something about thesemantics of the sentence,\" Google said in a blog. Always in 2017, WIRED reported on a researcher at OpenAI whowas already working on a system in which AIs invent their language, improving their ability to process informationquickly and therefore tackle difficult problems more effectively,[281] but that will also automatically leave humansout of the picture, helping in the process the establishment a “Terminator” style reality. Similar stories, which havenow been conveniently forgotten, appeared in the same period in The Sun, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph,and in other online publications. It seemed at the time, like something from a science fiction film - The Sun evenincluded a few pictures of scary-looking androids at the time[282].         So, is it time to panic and start preparing forthe apocalypse at the hands of machines? The answer of the corrupt BBC, the home of all British evil, was, of"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"course: “Probably not. While some great minds – including Stephen Hawking - are concerned that one day AI couldthreaten humanity, the Facebook story is nothing to be worried about.”[283]The late Stephen Hawking told BBC in 2014, 4 years before his death, that the development offull artificial intelligence, could spell the end of the human race, and he was not the only voice at the time warningof such dangers, the rise of the AI worried also Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak, all legendary figures ofthe Silicon Valley milieu, that expressed their concerns about where this technology was heading - though ProfessorHawking's was probably the most apocalyptic, having a vision of a world where robots decide they don't need us,just like in the film “Terminator.” I don’t trust the BBC, just as I don’t trust Henry Kissinger and his friends, but Itend to trust instead Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant minds to ever walk on the planet.In this unprecedented scenario, the “AI religion is upon us. Welcome to the future.” Writes SigalSamuel from The Vox, talking about a new priest named Mindar that appeared at Kodaiji, a 400-year-old Buddhisttemple in Kyoto, Japan in the last couple of years. Like other clergy members, this priest can deliver sermons andmove around to interface with worshippers, but Mindar comes with some unusual traits: a body made of aluminumand silicone, for starters. He is designed to look like Kannon, the Buddhist deity of mercy, the $1 million machine isan attempt to reignite people’s passion for their faith in a country where religious affiliation is on the decline.​ For now, fortunately, Mindar is not AI-powered, but that will change soon. Currently, the high-tech creaturejust recites the same preprogrammed sermon about the Heart Sutra, over and over. But the robot’s creators say theyplan to give it machine-learning capabilities that’ll enable it to tailor feedback to worshippers’ specific spiritual andethical problems.[284] Because the future of the upcoming “One World Religion” believe it or not, will be based onArtificial Intelligence, that promises to remake the world including religion.This reminds me of one of the most influential science fiction stories, The Last Question byIsaac Asimov, which dramatizes the uncanny relationship between the digital and the divine. These days, the story isusually told in distilled and updated form, as a kind of joke: A group of scientists create an A.I. system and ask him,“Is there a god?” The A.I. spits out an answer: “Insufficient computing power to determine an answer.” They addmore computing power and ask again, “Is there a god?” They get the same answer. Then they redouble their effortsand spend years and years improving the A.I.’s capacity. Then they ask again, “Is there a god?” The A.I. responds,“There is now.” [285] That’s, of course, a truly diabolic answer, from the future Cyber Satan, preparing for themoment we will eventually merge with machines.​ For Klaus Schwab, and the elite of the New World Order transhumanism, is an integral part of “The GreatReset,” because the fourth industrial revolution would “lead to a fusion of our physical, digital, and biologicalidentity,” which Schwab himself clarifies is a result of implantable microchips that can read your thoughts, and ofcourse, the Vatican knows all this (as I explained also in Vol.6.66), and in the last few years, the Jesuits are activelyinvolved in facilitating the rise of Cyber Satan and the Antichrist by forging a One World Religion. Fortunately forthem and Pope Francis the False Prophet, there is still some resistance from a powerful player on the global religiousstage, and that’s Kirill Patriarch of Moscow, the Russian Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church sinceFebruary 2009. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church says smartphones risk bringing humanity closer to thearrival of the Anti-Christ. Patriarch Kirill also says the church does not oppose technological progress but ishowever concerned that the data-gathering capacity of the devices shares too much information to uninterestedparties. Kirill who seems to be genuinely worried said such information could be used for centralized control of theworld.[286]​ The Russian and Greek Orthodox churches ten years ago also objected to plans in both countries to introduceelectronic national identity cards, intended to streamline bureaucracy and, in the case of Greece, facilitate integrationinto the increasingly technocratic European Union. But Church officials demanded a close study of the cards, askingthe authorities to make them optional. They said that the personal and financial information that would beconsolidated on the microchips in the cards could be manipulated to discriminate against believers, a subject that is,of course, of great relevance today with the so-called vaccine passports called in Europe, “Green Pass.”In an interview given at the time to Rossiiskaya Gazeta, an official government newspaper,Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate's Department of External ChurchRelations, said:Credit cards, which a person uses to take money from a bank machine or for payment in a store, are onething, but a personal card in which all the information about a person's life and activities will be entered, abouthis bank accounts, health and travels is a different matter. These are different grades of state control overpeople.[287]"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"​ Back then, the conservative and nationalist wings within the churches in Athens and Moscow were stillstrong, and both claimed that the cards will compromise national and religious identity, and even Patriarch Kiril saidin a meeting of the Bishop's Council of the Russian Orthodox that,the church understands the position of people who do not wish to be subject to control that makes itpossible to gather all-encompassing information about their private life and could in the long-term be used todiscriminate against citizens based on their worldview.​ For this reason, the Bishop's Council of the Russian Orthodox Church allegedly asked the government tomake electronic forms of identification optional.[288] However, things have slightly changed since the arrival of theChina virus, and while Russia's powerful Orthodox Church still criticizes the EU for the introduction of COVIDpassports in March 2021, stating that such passport would breach the principle of voluntariness of vaccination that iscurrently declared in most countries, including European countries[289], they now admonish people refusing to bevaccinated against COVID-19, calling them sinners who would have to atone for the rest of their lives.[290] A suddenchange, that seems to be more in line with that of the Vatican these days, that aside from a pope constantlypromoting the use of the vaccines, even sanctioning their employees who refuse to get the jab, unless they have“proven health reasons.”[291] FIG. 24 –– Android Kannon Mindar preaching to monks of the Kodaiji Temple in Kyoto in February 2019."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Astana/Satana and the Sanitary Dictatorship of The Fourth Reich In this context, the Jesuits are working behind the scenes to arrange another historical meeting between PopeFrancis and Patriarch Kirill, after the first meeting that was held in February 2016 in Havana, in Communist/JesuitCuba, that brought the two religious leaders to sign a thirty points joint declaration. Some say this historical meetingwill take place in the former city of Astana now Nur Sultan, in Kazakhstan. For this reason, the ambassador ofKazakhstan to the Holy See, said back in December 2020, that there were “high hopes” that Pope Francis will visitthe Central Asian country.[292] But things, as you all know, have changed in Kazakhstan recently, and that historicalmoment they were all hoping for in 2021, will not happen in Astana, at least for the time being.​ Kazakhstan emerged as a popular Bitcoin mining hub last year after neighboring China cracked down on theactivity that requires significant computing power and electricity, and Kazakhstan, with its rich energy resources,soon became an attractive alternative to China for crypto miners, that also from neighboring China moved in likevultures to take advantage of the situation, creating the current energy crisis that leads to social unrest with the helpof the British MI6, interested, of course, in putting pressure on Russia in a period of unprecedented tension due tothe Ukraine crisis.​ Going back to the possible meeting between Pope Francis and his Russian counterpart in the OrthodoxChurch, it will be a milestone for the Vatican once it happens, mainly because Patriarch Kirill is the only missingpiece of their diabolical puzzle, in their One World Religion project. That’s why in early December 2021, on thereturn flight from Greece, Pope Francis said that the second meeting between him and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, was currently being organized. “A meeting with Patriarch Kirill is not faron the horizon. I think next week [Metropolitan] Hilarion is coming to me to arrange a possible meeting,”[293] saidthe Jesuit Pope, during his usual press conference aboard the papal plane, and Pope Francis showed his willingnessto travel anywhere, including Moscow, for the meeting, emphasizing that what is more important than “protocols”because he considers the Patriarch his “brother,” that as we know is also Masonic term, not only a Christian one. Of course, the ideal place for such a crucial meeting between the Pope and the Patriarch ofMoscow would have been the more “neutral” Astana, rather than Moscow, which happens to be the anagram ofSatana, meaning Satan in Italian (the official language of the Vatican). Satan/Satana derives, in fact, from theHebrew “Haşatán > ha-Satan”, meaning “obstruct, oppose,” and the last remaining obstruction, or opposition to thisOne World Religion project set up by the Jesuits, and high-level Freemasons, happens to be the Patriarch ofMoscow, but let’s talk about the key role of Astana that has been called by many in the last few years the “IlluminatiCapital of the World.”In 2017, Canadian author and Freemason Frank Albo published, Astana: Architecture, Myth & Destiny and iscurrently an adjunct professor of history at the University of Winnipeg. Albo, who has helped the Republic ofKazakhstan in the last few years with the unusual job of chief mythologizer for the former city of Astana, now calledNur-Sultan since March 23, 2019, described the city in question as to the solution to the three greatest threats of the21st century: religious extremism, environmental destruction, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Nur-Sultanhas openly demonstrated its commitment to the New World Order/Green New Deal energy nonsense, with an eventcalled EPO 2017, as well as promoting its central role in the One World Religion project with a glass pyramidnamed, The Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, also known as, The Pyramid of Peace and Accord. This is a 62-meter-high (203 ft) pyramid placed in the capital of Kazakhstan, that serves as a non-denominational nationalspiritual center and as an event venue. The unusual location was designed by the British International Studio forarchitecture and integrated design of Foster & Partners Ltd, established by influential Freemason and aristocraticarchitect Lord Norman Robert Foster (Baron Foster of Thames Bank).​ Kazakhstan left the Soviet Union in 1990, but Russia has still a big influence on this country, as the recentcrisis that took place in early 2022 fully demonstrated, and for this reason, Freemasonry was officially brought thereby the Grand Lodge of Russia (another tool in the hands of Vladimir Putin), that on May 20, 2017, consecrated onthe East side of Astana, the new Worshipful Lodge #4 under name of “Bayterek,” formalizing the creation of theGrand Lodge of Kazakhstan.[294] Baiterek is a monument and observation tower located on Nurjol Boulevard and isconsidered a symbol of post-independence Kazakhstan, and the centerpiece of Kazakhstan's capital Astana. At thetop, you can put your hand into a golden cast of former President Nazabayev's right palm and make a wish.[295]​ Visitors are also encouraged to send a telepathic message to the president by touching the golden handimprint. Now, this might seem just like another crazy cult of the personality, typical of that part of the world, butthere is something even more strange and sinister at work here, as in some esoteric circles they seem to think that theAntichrist will one day be touching that golden hand imprint, formalizing his role in the One World Religion in theformer city of Astana, now Nur Sultan. Now, you might think this is insane, but ChristianWeek, which attended the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"fifth Congress of the Leaders of World and Traditional Religions as a media observer a few years ago, wrote theseshocking words about the interreligious project being unleashed in Astana/Nur Sultan.In an age of secularism, where every religion is considered equal before the law, the pursuit to “unifyreligion” is on the rise. While peace and tolerance between religious groups are certainly preferable overhatred and extremism, it might be a dangerous path for Christians to go down when Jesus—the sole mediatorbetween God and human beings—loses His uniqueness as the incarnate God. A God who not only saves culturethrough His death and resurrection but also transforms culture by His Spirit and through His missionalagency, the Church.When government pursues “inter-religious harmony” as a strategy for world peace, at best we canconclude that the gospel of secularism is on the march, at worst, we are left wondering if the Illuminati mightbe taking over the world.[296]​ While other nations of the former USSR struggled on through what would become (for many) a decade ofeconomic depression, the Kazakhs struck oil in 1991. The discovery of rich oil reserves in the nation’s Caspianregion invigorated the newly independent country and laid the foundation for what would become a culture ofextravagance, that quickly attracted the interest of the Illuminati and international Masonic community, as well asthe religious community, who have gradually agreed in converging many important interests to this city, with strongties to Moscow. In 2018, for example, Pope Francis and the infamous Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus from the WHOmet in Rome,[297] so the Jesuit Pope could carefully instruct him two days before the start of The GlobalConference on Primary Health Care[298], which took place on the 25th and 26th of October of that year in Astana.It was a classic meeting, between a Jesuit supervisor and his Illuminati subordinate. Officially, the conference inquestion marked the 40th anniversary of the historic Alma Aty Declaration, and its supposed commitment toachieve health for all. But of course, most of the delegates present in Astana were working as agents of CommunistChina. As the WHO in recent years has gradually fallen into the hands of Beijing, just in time for the pandemic andthe Great Reset.In October 2018, the government, civil society, the private sector, and other stakeholders met to reaffirm aglobal commitment to primary health care. At its heart, primary health care is about caring for people, ratherthan simply treating specific diseases or conditions. It is also the most effective way to sustainably solvetoday’s health and health system challenges.The Global Conference on Primary Health Care, which took place in Astana, Kazakhstan, endorsed a newdeclaration emphasizing the critical role of primary health care around the world. The declaration aims torefocus efforts on primary health care to ensure that everyone everywhere can enjoy the highest possibleattainable standard of healthThe PHC approach is foundational to achieving our shared global goals in Universal Health Coverage(UHC) and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[299]​ I’m sorry to say that the Global Conference on Primary Health Care, that took place in Astana, seemed morelike a preparatory meeting set up by the Fourth Reich for the kickstart of the upcoming pandemic (that started tospread from the Wuhan lab one year later), than a genuine meeting to improve health care around the world. Moreevidence that this pandemic was planned for years by the Vatican-led New World Order and their agents, like Jesuitstooge Dr. Fauci. That’s why we call it plandemic now. A crisis that has not stopped however the Jesuit Pope, whocontinues to travel around the world to make new alliances and receive endorsements for the Jesuit One WorldReligion project, despite his precarious health conditions, that experts say will bring him to resign soon. That’s whyto complete the One World Religion project before his death or resignation, Pope Francis even went to Iraq inMarch 2021, becoming the first pope to visit the war-torn country for the first international papal trip in over a yeardue to the pandemic.​ The Vatican was eager to have the Shiite Muslim community on board of his “Human Fraternity,” theMasonic covenant, also known as the Abu Dhabi Declaration, that was first signed in early 2019 with the GrandImam Ahmed al-Tayyeb and was followed in 2020 by his Masonic encyclical Fratelli Tutti (“Brothers All”), wherehe even quoted the Qur’an, as well as various Freemasons to launch a clear message to the Masonic allies around theworld. That’s why Pope Francis has been carelessly traveling, even during the worst moments of the pandemic.Pope Francis’ new Quasi-Masonic Encyclical looks like a Communist Manifesto and includes the names of at least"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"three known Freemasons. During his visit to Iraq, the Pope went also to Nāṣiriya for a service entitled, “Prayer forthe sons and daughters of Abraham” old at the Plain of Ur, and the event happened a few hours after a historicalmeeting the Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in Najaf, another powerful figure who joined in an unprecedentedmove, the Vatican-Jesuit-led One World Religion alliance. Pope Francis hold the controversial interreligiousmeeting near the house of Ibrahim, the Prophet, which has a special religious meaning for Christians and Muslims,mainly because as the Bible states Abraham was raised in “Ur of the Chaldeans” (Ur Kasdim), and some scholars(but not all....) believe that Ur Kasdim was indeed the Sumerian city Ur, called today Tall al-Muqayyar (or Tall al-Mughair found about 200 miles (300 km) southeast of Baghdad in lower Mesopotamia.​ The One World Religion project is coming together, and it will be finalized one day in Astana/Nur-Sultan,the capital of Kazakhstan, recently renamed in honor of former President Nazarbaev, who back in 1990 when he wasthe First Secretary of the Kazakhstan Communist Party, created a state basis for Islam by removing Kazakhstanfrom the authority of the Muslim Board of Central Asia, the Soviet-approved and politically oriented religiousadministration for Central Asia. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a name that seems out of a “Borat” movies, who previouslyserved as the first President of Kazakhstan, in office from April 24, 1990, until his formal resignation on March 19, 2019, joined instead the Jesuit controlled Organization of Islamic Cooperation in 1995, one year after visiting theMuslim holy city of Mecca as a Muslim, as part of an itinerary that also included however a visit to none other thanPope John Paul II at the Vatican, who later visited himself Astana in 2001. For this reason, Kazakhstan is also acountry with a rather intense collaboration with the infamous Jesuit/Islamic Gulen movement, that Nursultan himselfeventually banned from the country in 2016 only to please Turkey, which is another very close ally of Kazakhstan.       ​ Behind the scenes, the Vatican-led One World Religion advances daily with Pope Francis, who is not onlyembracing the spirit of the coming Antichrist but actively working for him. And in the future, my inside sources saythe Petrine ministry could be passed on from Bergoglio to Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson, a loyal friend, andcollaborator of both the Jesuits and Professor Klaus Schwab who are ready to complete the destruction of theCatholic faith, and the last remaining Christian values in it. Turkson, another Catholic liberal/Communist, whooffered Pope Francis his resignation in December 2021, because he was officially at the end of his five-yearappointment as prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development and has been indicated bymany Freemasons as papabile, that is, an ideal candidate for election to the papacy.One of them is Catholic convert David L. Gray, a former African American Freemason, author,and speaker on the history of Prince Hall Freemasonry, who is now a staunch Catholic supporter, theologian, author,speaker, and radio show host, president, and publisher of Saint Dominic's Media,[300]who had the possibility ofpersonally meeting and even traveling with Cardinal Peter Turkson, who seems to think after his direct interactionwith him, that he might become the next pope.​ Turkson, that The Table described as “one of Africa's most energetic church leaders,[301]”made someinteresting statements regarding his fake climate agenda crusade, in a webinar that took place in December 2020,organized by the dicastery's powerful COVID-19 commission, and its partners in the New World Order. He statedthere was a need for Catholics, science experts, and youth to come together to save the climate in preparation for theclimate summit, co-hosted by the United Nations, and the United Kingdom in December 2020. The event inquestion, that marked the fifth anniversary of the idiotic Paris Agreement, was called “a monumental step on theroad to the UK-hosted COP26.[302]” Needless to say, the event in question, and the COP 26 that followed less than ayear later in Glasgow, were both useless farses that left people wondering why they are even bothering with suchfoolish actions. The COP26 conference, for example, set a record for CO2 emissions, with air travel as the mainculprit. According to estimates, the two-week COP26 summit in November 2021, emitted about 102,500 tons ofcarbon dioxide and that’s the equivalent of the annual emissions for more than 8,000 U.K. residents.[303]The criminals involved in The Great Reset are trying to facilitate the rise of Communist China, themain production hub of the New World Order, that would peak emissions in 2030, becoming in the process thewealthiest nation in the world, and as announced will go carbon neutral, only in 2060, a few decades after the rest ofthe world. Remember these sick individuals, that want to destroy the American dream, and the rest of the Westerndemocracies in general, are only helping China, a country that is also sponsoring, with its billions, the Vatican, sincethe arrival of Pope Francis due to the old alliance between the Jesuits and China that I have discussed in detail inVol.4.[304]​ Cardinal Turkson said that while there are many active faith-based global networks in place, “there appear tobe some slight disconnects between the head and the body,” of the Catholic Church so that when the Pope speaks itdoes not always resonate with every part of the world. Building and activating this globalist connection bypromoting The Great Reset, and the New Green Deal, seems to be the new mission of the Church and, of course,Cardinal Turkson, the possible future Pope. A figure that will probably renounce his role as supreme pontiff in the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"early years, in favor of a more Communistic approach, making Francis the last Pope to be the chief pastor of theworldwide Catholic Church in the traditional sense, and technically the last Pope, as I suggested in the title of one ofmy earlier books.[305]In the meantime, Pope Francis after being supportive of the sanitary dictatorship by closing allhis churches has promoted from the very start the belief in science and vaccines as the only possible solution to allour problems and not God. The first thing the Vatican did in this context was to issue immediately a controversialedict in 2020, declaring the COVID-19 vaccination a “moral responsibility.” This controversial move proved onceagain that Pope Francis’ church is always willing to put science in front of God. The document in question consistsof three parts:A. ContextB. On vaccinesC. Guidelines for the Vatican COVID-19 Commission​ The Vatican states that:On the moral responsibility of undergoing vaccination, it is necessary to reiterate how this issue alsoinvolves the relationship between personal health and public health, showing their close interdependence. Inlight of this connection, we consider it important that a responsible decision be taken in this regard, since therefusal of the vaccine may also constitute a risk to others. [306]​ Adding that if, “the motivation is to avoid benefiting from the results of a voluntary abortion” it can beconsidered “morally acceptable, under precise conditions” since the Vatican considers it “indirect and remote.” Aftera couple of weeks from the publication of the document, the Pope even went on record describing the refusal to getthe vaccine as suicidal. Finally, a decree was issued during Christmas 2021 by Secretary of State Cardinal PietroParolin, which outlined that the past option of providing a negative COVID test to enter the Vatican will beremoved, and the only way to work at or visit the Catholic Church’s headquarters will be proof of recovering fromCOVID in the past via a recorded positive PCR test or being fully vaccinated and from January 31, 2022, anyoneworking at the Vatican must provide “documentation proving the administration of the booster dose following theprimary cycle of vaccination.”[307] In other words, no jab, no job, in what seems to be the new headquarters of Satanon planet Earth, not of Jesus.However, outside of the Vatican madness, some rare exceptions to the Pope’s pro-vaccinestand did occur in the Catholic world, the most notable one being that of Bishop Joseph Strickland, the Bishop ofthe Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler, in Texas, that denounced in the same period the abortion-tainted vaccineswith a strong statement: “I would encourage people to resist any forcing of receiving these vaccines.” [308]Unfortunately for him, most of the Catholic Bishops, are backing up Pope Francis’ controversial support forscience and the sanitary dictatorship. In Vienna, for example, in December 2021 an outspoken Jewish anthropologistis comparing the latest Austrian Catholic bishops' endorsement of the nation's totalitarian vaccine plan, to theAustrian Catholic hierarchy's support for Hitler under the National Socialist regime.​ Popular writer Karen Harradine, an anthropologist and freelance journalist, who writes about politics andantisemitism, told my friends at Church Militant that, “The Austrian bishops are yet again guilty of placating evil.They supported the Anschluss (Hitler's annexation of Austria), with Cardinal Innitzer flying the Nazi flag forHitler,” and now Austria has become the first Western democracy to mandate COVID-19 jabs for its entire adultpopulation. The law, which should take effect on February 1st, 2022, will remain active for three years and willamend Austria's strict data-protection legislation to permit the linkage of private electronic health records withcentralized vaccination registers, and that is what the New World Order wants for everyone. In full support of such Nazi-inspired monstrosity, in December 2021, the Austrian Bishops'Conference issued a statement championing the State's “temporary legal obligation to vaccinate,” and emphasizingthat the government has full discretionary power to decide if a vaccine mandate “is now the appropriate means toprotect the common good.” While appearing to support, individual rights, by labeling “compulsory vaccination” a“serious interference with the physical integrity and freedom of the individual,” the bishops went on to invalidatethis qualification by offering the State carte blanche over bodily autonomy. The bishops added that compulsoryvaccination is “only permissible if all other possibilities have been exhausted, taking proportionality into account, toprotect the population — in the event of a pandemic, the health system, and thus human life. Ultimately, it is theresponsibility of the government to assess whether the prerequisites for this are met,” observed the prelates (havingalready concluded that the pandemic is extremely serious and that vaccines in their twisted vision of things prevent"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"transmission and save lives).The bishops urged Catholics to be vaccinated, quoting, of course, Pope Francis' declaration that“vaccination is an act of charity,” and since “previous calls have not been sufficient,” the bishops argued that thegovernment's legal obligation to force the jab is justified. At this point, “It is as if the State had written the text of thebishops' statement,\" said Austrian Catholic activist Alexander Tschugguel, who also said, “Despite the weasel wordsand the doublespeak of the statement, it is more than clear our shepherds support the State's health tyranny.” [309]Tschugguel explained that the bishops had not only violated the principle of conscientious objection, but also adirective from the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) that states that vaccination “must bevoluntary.” For this reason, “All the bishops needed to do was to reissue the CDF decree or to insert the sentencefrom the decree on vaccination not being obligatory,\" said Tschugguel — who shot to fame after dunking fivePachamama idols in the Tiber River during the Amazon Synod, an event I described in Volume 4 of myConfessions. Tschugguel, a Catholic convert from Lutheranism, also confirmed that Austrian democracy hasvirtually collapsed with the government's refusal to invite Herbert Kickl (leader of Austria's Freedom Party) andother elected representatives to discuss the mandate in question. Tschugguel predicted the situation would worsennow that Austria's former interior minister, Karl Nehammer is the chancellor. Nehammer abused his office asinterior minister, giving police disproportionate powers to crack down on the unvaccinated. Tschugguel also toldChurch Militant that he was prohibited by Austrian law from drawing any comparisons between the prevailinghealth dictatorship and Austria's capitulation to Hitler under the Third Reich. Blasting the Austrian bishops for “theirmediocre and forked-tongued [sic] response to what is essentially the persecution of the other — the unvaccinated,”Karen Harradine said that “as a Jew, anthropologist and human being” she was horrified by the prelates' attitude.[310] ​ This means that what we can now unequivocally call “The Great Nazi Reset,” set up to help theimplementation of the Fourth Reich, is currently underway in Europe, kicking off in German-speaking countries andItaly, the birthplace of fascism, where Italian bishops also celebrated the country’s unprecedented expansion of Statepower, as the predominantly Catholic country stripped its unvaccinated population of basic human rights, includingthe right to work, travel, access healthcare, equality, and exercise freedom of conscience. “We are making thesechoices to restrict the unvaccinated as much as possible,” said health minister Roberto Speranza to the Italian mediain early January 2022 after a cabinet meeting, as the State was tightening its grip on the unvaccinated. Avvenire, theItalian Episcopal Conference's newspaper (which has been rooting for stricter vaccine policies), gleefully announcedthat “the bridge had been crossed and a general vaccine obligation imposed.”[311]​ I find this a disturbing trend among the same countries that choose authoritarianism and racism overdemocracy in the 1930s, something that brings immediately to mind the infamous Pact of Steel, signed betweenGermany and Italy in May 1939, that formalized the 1936 Rome-Berlin Axis agreement, linking the two countriespolitically and militarily, just before the kickstart of World War II. History, unfortunately, tends to repeat itselfcyclically, as the unvaccinated, that are almost treated like the Jews after the implementation of the horrifying raciallaws, are now banned from all shops and every other area of society in such countries, besides essential services, andfollowing the Austrian trend, the mandatory vaccination for the China virus is on its way in Italy, Germany and soonthe rest of Europe. Something many brainwashed demoncrats, and fake conservatives want to implement also herein the U.S. if we don’t stop them.​ Dr. Andreas Noack, who made the news last year, in November 2020, during the first year of the pandemic,when he was raided brutally by the German police, while he was streaming live against the COVID lockdownfrenzy,[312]suddenly died one year later, after moving to Austria, where he continued his battle against the Germanauthorities (couldn’t he have moved somewhere else?). Dr. Andreas Noack died on November 26, 2021, five daysafter he made a video exposing the negative side effects of graphene oxide, which Dr. Noack, and other academics,claim can be found inside the vaccines, inviting in his video the German population to write to the new Germanchancellor about his shocking discoveries, and reminding them also about the dangers of following Austria,especially after what happened with Austrian born Adolf Hitler. This was a bold statement indeed, that might haveinfluenced the decision of the local authorities to harass him again, as there is still an untold rule, about mentioningHitler in Germany, as well as Austria, and Dr. Noack broke it. Regarding instead the controversy surroundinggraphene oxide, Pfizer and Moderna, have toldReuters on more than one occasion in the last few months, that graphene oxide is not present inany part of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.[313] However, Dr. Andreas Noack, who was following the latestresearch of Prof. Dr. Pablo Campra, who is a known professor and researcher, who currently works at the FoodTechnology Division of the Department of Agronomy at the University de Almeria in Spain, thought otherwise.What I will include now, is a summary of Pablo Campra’s research on this subject that might have got Dr. AndreasNoack in trouble. I’m not a medical doctor, neither I ever claimed to be one, as I respect this profession that used to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"be also my father’s, so the following summary is only exposed here regarding Noack‘s mysterious death, not as amedical statement per se, about its validity.Of course, I might personally agree with it, but that’s, of course, my opinion, nothing more, and I repeat I’m notan expert on such matters.We present here our research on the presence of graphene in COVID vaccines. We have carried out arandom screening of graphene-like nanoparticles visible at the optical microscopy in seven random samples ofvials from four different trademarks, coupling images with their spectral signatures of RAMAN vibration. Bythis technique, called micro-RAMAN, we have been able to determine the presence of graphene in some ofthese samples, after screening more than 110 objects selected for their graphene-like appearance under opticalmicroscopy. Out of them, a group of 28 objects has been selected, due to the compatibility of both images andspectra with the presence of graphene derivatives, based on the correspondence of these signals with thoseobtained from standards and scientific literature. The identification of graphene oxide structures can beregarded as conclusive in 8 of them, due to the high spectral correlation with the standard. In the remaining 20objects, images coupled with Raman signals show a very high level of compatibility with undeterminedgraphene structures, different than the standard used here. This research remains open and is made availableto the scientific community for discussion. We make a call for independent researchers, with no conflict ofinterest or coaction from any institution to make a wider counter-analysis of these products to achieve a moredetailed knowledge of the composition and potential health risk of these experimental drugs reminding thatgraphene materials have potential toxicity on human beings and its presence has not been declared in anyemergency use authorization.[314]​ After Dr. Noack’s death, his partner, who is currently pregnant with his child, published a video on hisofficial Telegram channel announcing the sad event saying: “The attack was extremely sneaky and unexpected. Ihave a terrible job to tell you that sadly, Andreas did not survive the assault. The news is extremely shocking for allof us. But Andreas is in me and I am a part of him. We are one.”She also stated that now it is all about humanity and, “He did it for you. He died for you. Hewas not afraid of death, he accepted the possibility. It’s horrible that it had to happen this way. It wasn’t the plan forhim to leave us this quickly.” She ended the video by stating, “I need you guys. I can’t do it alone.” The video wasalso posted on Twitter[315] where it gathered lots of attention. However, a day later, probably under pressure,Noack’s partner published a second video on Telegram, clarifying that Noack had simply died from a heart attack,without mentioning any harassment by the Austrian police authorities. She explained that he had collapsed at homeand was taken to a hospital in Wolfsberg, in southern Austria. Austrian police also told a regional newspaper thatNoack died of natural causes.[316]The website of a funeral home in Wolfsberg said he was only 57 when he died.[317]​ This was probably one of the saddest stories I had to report during this neverending plandemic, for thisreason, I decided to dedicate this book to Dr. Andreas Noack, as well as two other victims of this sanitarydictatorship imposed by the rising Fourth Reich. First, my friend Hans Gaarder (1960-2021), an investigativejournalist and known NWO researcher from Norway, officially died of COVID-19 in early April 2021 under verymysterious circumstances, who badly vilified after his death by the Norwegian mainstream media. You can find outmore about Hans, who was also one of the founders of the Norwegian online alternative-news magazineNyhetsspeilet, in both Volume 1,[318]and Volume 2,[319] of my Confessions, which include, also two articles,[320][321] he wrote about me and my Norwegian experiences. Basically, after witnessing firsthand what happened to mein Norway, including the brutality of my arrest for espionage, Hans became one of the most outspoken Norwegianvoices against the Vatican-led New World Order, and that’s what probably cost him his life.God bless you, Hans, I will never forget your courage, and your kindness towards me,especially in those moments of great difficulty and despair during the last months of my life in Norway. Anothervictim that also died in similar circumstances was the Italian Dr. Domenico Biscardi (1968-2022), labeled a “No-vax” for his alternative theories on COVID, the vaccines, and the pandemic, that according to the official version ofthe events, died of a heart attack in his home in Naples in early January 2022. Domenico, a fellow countrymanknown also as Mimmo, who was very popular in Italy, used his social media to spread to a rather big audience histruths and opinions. “Coincidentally,” Dr. Biscardi, who was about to submit an official complaint against BigPharma to the European Commission regarding the ingredients present in the vaccines after receiving a recent labreport, just like Dr. Andreas Noack, talked about the presence of graphene oxide, but also nano router technology inthe vaccines."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"FIG. 25 –– The late Dr. Andreas Noack (1964-2021) in a frame from the live stream he made in November 2020 when he was brutally raided by theGerman police."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"FIG. 26 –– The late Norwegian journalist Hans Gaarder and the author in Oslo in 2008."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"FIG. 27 –– Dr. Domenico Biscardi (1968-2022), the Italian anti-vaccine doctor who wanted to submit an official complaint against Big Pharma to theEuropean Commission but died in mysterious circumstances."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURThe Unfolding of The Fourth ReichThe Illuminati Playgrounds of Austria, Germany, and SwitzerlandThe Fourth Reich concept, being the successor to Adolf Hitler's infamous Third Reich (1933–1945), has beenmostly relegated in the pages of some fringe conspiracy theorists, like the late Jim Marrs (1943-2017) for example,who used it to refer to what he perceived as a covert continuation of Nazi ideals. In one of his latest works publishedin 2015, The Rise of the Fourth Reich: The Secret Societies That Threaten to Take Over America, Marrs claimed thatNazis infiltrated the U.S. at every level of government. Combining revisionist history with careful research, theauthor and conspiracy researcher, offered at the time, a plethora of material that connected the Nazi’s move afterWorld War II to the Americas, to what is going on in American politics today. Certainly, Marrs, whose previouswork entitled Crossfire (1989), was also the basis of the Oliver Stone movie JFK, seemed to be serious in hisassertions, even though he eased off on the pedal, as if a touch embarrassed, when his subjects got too weird evenfor him, in certain parts of the book. After excitedly postulating that Hitler escaped the bunker in 1945, Marrs (whoalso wrote Rule by Secrecy: The Hidden History That Connects the Trilateral Commission, the Freemasons, and theGreat Pyramids, 2000, etc.), cleared his throat once and for all by declaring that Hitler’s fate “is immaterial, a mootpoint. What is certain is that Hitler’s legacy—National Socialism—lives on.”[322] And I’m sure we can all agree onthis statement. However, immediately after his controversial book on the Fourth Reich came out, a newdocumentary series started at the History Channel, entitled “Hunting Hitler,” that explored how Hitler might haveescaped, where might he have gone, and whether he plotted a Fourth Reich.[323] The series in question ran for threeseasons between 2015 and 2018, followed by a two-hour special in 2020.[324] ​ Jim Marrs wasn’t the only author to have talked about the possibility of a Fourth Reich being a reality intoday’s world, we also had the late Max Spiers, who died under mysterious circumstances in 2016, and PeterLevenda one of my favorite authors on this subject, who talks extensively of the occult background and roots of theNazi movement, in his book published in 2003, Unholy Alliance: A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult, thatshows how the idea of a vast international network of late 19th- and early 20th-century occult groups influencedNazi ideology. However, I often wonder these days how the late Jim Marrs, would have reacted to what has beenhappening to us since the beginning of the China virus plandemic that makes it more obvious how they are trulyworking towards a Fourth Reich.​ In this absurd context that keeps unfolding each day, an Austrian brothel in Vienna was pushing an absurdgimmick to entice people into getting vaccinated by offering free “sex sessions” with a sex worker of their choice ifthey took the jab. This clear attempt to bribe the skeptics was made at the Fun Palast: Sex Star Sauna Club inVienna, which was administering COVID-19 vaccination on-site, in November 2021, every Monday from 4 pm to10 pm, offering in their unusual COVID package a free 30-minute session with a “lady of your choice” at theirsexual “sauna club.” On top of that, those 14 and older, were allowed to enter the club, if they were accompanied byan adult.A truly controversial move worthy of a Third World country, that could be used to cover upterrible acts of pedophilia in broad daylight. Usually, men go to brothels, but in this context, even girls 14 and abovewere encouraged to visit the site for this special offer. Keep in mind that prostitution, the provision of sexualservices by adults, is generally legal in Austria. According to the current case law of the Austrian Supreme Court,contracts for sexual services between sex service providers and customers are generally permissible[325], but that’snot the problem I’m exposing here, but only a necessary specification for a better understanding of the roots of thisperversion and liberal behavior in Austria, of all places, that is found in the Illuminati and the esoteric movements,that strived in Germany and Austria between 1880 and 1945, and shaped many occult groups presenting elements ofTheosophy, Anthroposophy, and Ariosophy against the influences of earlier European esotericism. This way,Austria has become the number one experimental ground of the Illuminati network, and among the first countries toembrace the modern New Age Antichristian philosophy that emanated from the infamous Theosophical Society, andlater gave birth to modern Satanism, as I explained in Volume 5 of my Confessions.​ The first German Theosophical Society was established in July 1884, under the presidency of WilhelmHübbe-Schleiden, a conservative German nationalist turned spiritual seeker who sought to establish Theosophy on asupposed “scientific” basis. Between 1886 and 1895 Hübbe-Schleiden published the monthly periodical Die Sphinx"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"in Vienna and in 1887, another Theosophical society was founded with its president, Friedrich Eckstein. Among hiscircle was Franz Hartmann (1831-1912), a known Rosicrucian author and Illuminati, and a young Rudolf Steiner(1861-1925), who later would publish a periodical called Lucifer-Gnosis. Steiner later rejected some of the morecontroversial elements of Theosophy and the Illuminati, to establish his own Anthroposophical brand under hislodges of the Masonic Rite of Misraim, the combined Masonic Rite of Memphis-Misraim, and the Adoption gradesof Egyptian Freemasonry. Steiner, however, claimed that although the Masonic lineage given to him in 1906 byIlluminati fringe Masonic agent Theodor Reuss gave him additional accreditation for his project, he did notofficially use these Masonic grades as a basis of his Misraim Service. It is very important to note that the grades ordegrees worked within Steiner’s Misraim Rite are unlike those of the traditional Masonic/Illuminati Rites hereceived authority to perform.The grades in Steiner's Misraim Rite were not (and are not) Masonic, they are purely Rosicrucian andunique in their dramatic style. In the summer of 1914, World War I begins and Steiner decides to put his MisraimRite to sleep while the war spreads through Europe. Some say that he never awoke it from its slumbers[326]but that’snot correct, and his disciples still work this unusual rite to this day, even here in the United States. After all, Steinerused the teachings from his reformed Misraim Rite for his Anthroposophical Society, trying to oppose in its“gnostic” way, the influences of the dark side of the Illuminati and controversial figures like Aleister Crowley thatpushed towards what Steiner defined as the “Ahrimanic Deception.”​ Like Ati Petrov, Owner of Real Medicine (2004-present) writes in a comment on Quora “Steiner uses thename Ahriman to describe a cosmic being who represents everything which is clever, intellectual, materialistic, rigidand with many laws and rules...but without heart or a value for the human or spiritual in us.“ I will analyze furtherthe evil figure of Ahriman, who is also called Satan in religious literature, later on in my book, but let’s go back tothe first steps of the influential Theosophical saga that took place in German-speaking countries.A German Theosophical Society, as a branch of the International Theosophical Brotherhood, wasestablished a decade later in 1896, when the American theosophists around William Quan Judge, Katherine Tingley,E. T. Hargrove, and C. F. Wright traveled through Europe. Franz Hartmann, who became the president of thisbranch, also founded a Theosophical lay monastery in Ascona, Switzerland, in 1889, which became an importantlaboratory for the development of the future New Age movement and the Illuminati in Europe. His periodicalLotusblüten (Lotus Blossoms, 1892–1900), which possibly ended in the hands of Adolf Hitler, was the first Germanpublication to use the theosophical swastika on its cover,[327]and Hitler’s demented racial ideology, content, andoccult sources all came from Theosophy and a Theosophist, in particular, Guido (von) List (1848–1919), ajournalist, and writer who after turning to esotericism, became the first popular author to combine Völkisch ideologyand occultism into the type of esoteric doctrine that is now collectively labeled Ariosophy. In September 1903, theoccult periodical Die Gnosis included an article by List, in which he, referring to Sebaldt von Werth, began toarticulate “a Germanic occult religion.”​ In the following decade, List continued to work on this topic, also making references to the works of MadameBlavatsky, who co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875, and William Scott-Elliot, an early member of theLondon Lodge of the Theosophical society who elaborated Helena Blavatsky's concept of root races in severalpublications, most notably The Story of Atlantis (1896) and The Lost Lemuria (1904), later combined in 1925 into asingle volume called The Story of Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria.[328]​ In List, we find the concept of Armanism, a system of belief that attempts to explain the relationshipbetween God’s sovereignty and mankind’s free will, the religion of the Theocratic elite in his image of ancientGermanic past, List also borrowed material from Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism. So Armanism and Ariosophyare esoteric ideological systems that were pioneered by Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels respectively,in Austria between 1890 and 1930. [329]Now, whether Hitler had a formal or informal relationship with the Guidovon List Society during his years in Vienna from 1907-1913, has not been definitively established. However, theList Society was certainly prominent in the occult circles that stressed Volkisch nationalism and antisemitism in thatperiod in Austria, and Hitler was profoundly inspired by it, as Hitler himself emphasized in his Mein Kampf, it wasin Vienna that he established “a world picture and a philosophy which became the granite foundation” of all hisactions.​ That “granite foundation” was centered on his racial ideology. Nevertheless, it is more probable that Hitlerdid come into direct contact with another major proponent of Ariosophy (which means the wisdom of the Aryans),in Vienna, Lanz von Liebenfels (1874-1954).[330] In 1905, he published his book Theozoölogie oder die Kunde vonden Sodoms-Äfflingen und dem Götter-Elektron (Theozoology, or the Science of the Sodomite-Apelings and theDivine Electron) in which he advocated sterilization of the sick and the “lower races” as well as forced labor for“castrated chandals,” and glorified the “Aryan race” as “Gottmenschen” (“god-men”). Lanz justified his esotericracial ideology by attempting to give it a Biblical foundation; according to him, Eve, whom he described as initially"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"being divine, involved herself with a demon and gave birth to the “lower races” in the process. Furthermore, heclaimed that this led to blonde women being attracted primarily to “dark men”, something that only could be stoppedby “racial demixing” so that the “Aryan-Christian master humans” could “once again rule the dark-skinnedbeastmen” and ultimately achieve divinity. A copy of this book was sent to Swedish poet August Strindberg, fromwhom Lanz received an enthusiastic reply in which he was described as a “prophetic voice”. One year later, in 1905,Lanz von Liebenfels founded the magazine Ostara, Briefbücherei der Blonden und Mannesrechtler, of which hebecame the sole author and editor in 1908. Lanz is said to have up to 100,000 subscribers, but it is generally agreedthat this figure was grossly exaggerated. Readers of this publication included a young Adolf Hitler, Dietrich Eckart,and the British Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener among others. Lanz himself claimed he was visited by Hitler in1909, who he supplied with two missing issues of the magazine.[331] Like professor Richard B. Spence, a knownexpert on this subject from the University of Idaho once pointed out:Adolf Hitler is one of the most infamously influential men in modern history. He changed the course ofhistory by raging World War II and for his racist ideas. Although there are heaps of documents, speeches, andstatements about him, Hitler was a secretive man. It is believed that he was guided by secret forces that shapedhis ideology and gave him power. Though he took advantage of many historical changes and chaotic situationsat the time, it is possible that the secret societies had a great role in the making of Hitler.[332]​ Hitler came in contact, with those evil “secret forces,” that will eventually bring us to the monstrosities ofthe holocaust, in Austria’s Theosophical milieu, where he is still very popular to this day. Theosophy, founded bythe antisemitic Madame Blavatsky took root in Germany during the decades before World War II, but thesuperiority of the Aryan race is a cornerstone of Theosophical beliefs that were promoted in Austria back then,giving birth to Ariosophy, also extant in pre-Hitler Germany and Austria that became the base of Nazi ideology. Intheir perverse ideology only so-called “Aryan god-men” possessed the occult spirit and soul to lead the spiritualhierarchy of society. Jews were instead the prototypes of lesser races and were identified as animal men.​ To cancel any memory of Hitler’s Austrian origins and occult upbringing, in 2020, Austria has unveiled plansto “neutralize” the building where the Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler was born, by turning it into a policestation[333] but the fact that Hitler was Austrian by birth, and profoundly inspired by the perverse occult doctrines ofhis country, is a something the contemporary Austrian elite, directly involved, as I showed you earlier, to KlausSchwab and his Great Reset, will not be able to neutralize, especially in light of their new increasing antidemocraticmeasurers, and their “free sex sessions” for the vaccinated, that shows to the entire world the real authoritarian, andperverse nature, of Austrian’s elite.Another important element to explain the free “sex sessions” in exchange for the vaccine, is theAustrian Illuminati’s obsession for weird sexual practices that influenced the birth of the Ordo Templi Orientis, alsoknown by the acronym O.T.O., a powerful Illuminati sect later taken over by Aleister Crowley, that initially wascreated in the Austrian Theosophical milieu, thanks to Carl Kellner (1851 –1905), a chemist, inventor, andindustrialist born in Vienna, who also financed the late Franz Hartmann after he came back from living at theheadquarters of the Theosophical Society in Adyar, India. Kellner, who was a student of Freemasonry,Rosicrucianism, and Eastern mysticism considered today the founder of Ordo Templi Orientis, and sometimesreferred to as “the spiritual father of the O.T.O.”[334]In 1895, Kellner began to discuss his idea for founding this new branch of the Illuminati /AcademiaMasonica with his associate Theodor Reuss (1855-1923), aka Frater Merlin or Peregrinus. During thesediscussions, Kellner decided that the Academia Masonica should be called Ordo Templi Orientis (Oriental TemplarOrder). The occult inner circle of this Illuminati order (O.T.O. proper) would be organized parallel to the highestdegrees of the Rite of Memphis-Misraim and would teach the secret doctrines of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light,and Kellner’s “key” to Masonic symbolism that was to be found in sexual magic. For this reason, both men andwomen would be admitted at all levels to this order, but possession of the various degrees of Craft and high-gradeFreemasonry would be a prerequisite for admission to the inner circle of O.T.O. Due to the regulations of theestablished grand lodges which governed regular Masonry, women could not be made masons and would thereforebe excluded by default from membership in Ordo Templi Orientis. Reforming the Masonic system, to allow theadmission of women, may have been one of the reasons that Carl Kellner and his associates resolved to obtaincontrol over one of the many rites of masonry; possibly wishing to incorporate the practice of sex magic on the side.They believed that sex magic was, in fact, “...the key to all the secrets of the universe and all the symbolismever used by secret societies and religions.”[335]"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"​ However, the discussions, between Reuss and Kellner did not lead to positive results, because Reuss was verybusy at the time with a revival of the original Order of Illuminati, along with his associate in Dresden, LeopoldEngel (1824 - 1913).The story of Reuss also has a darker side. After having unsuccessfully tried his luck in Germany as a singer andjournalist, he moved to London, where he was also initiated into Freemasonry in 1876 and expelled in 1881 as hewas in arrears with the payment of dues, and frequented socialist and anarchist circles. In 1885, he become amember of the executive committee of the Socialist League. But his political comrades considered his Masonic andoccult interests exotic, and finally expelled him in 1886, believing they had unmasked him as a spy for the Germanpolice. It was after these events that Reuss returned to Berlin, where he met Engel, and where he continued for along time, always suspected of being an agent provocateur, to frequent the anarchist and socialist milieu. In Berlin,he met Engel, and the project of “awakening” the Bavarian Illuminati began.[336]​ Carl Kellner did not approve of the revived Illuminati Order Reuss was putting together with Engel, mainlybecause it would draw too much attention towards them. Over a hundred years earlier, the Illuminati had severallodges in Vienna and expanded into Austria and southwestern Germany. It gained important recruits such as Dalbergwho was at one time an Austrian minister and Baron d’Erthal. The Viennese members of the time also included akey figure of the Illuminati, Count Leopold Vilém Kolowrat (1727-1809), Supreme Chancellor to the king, andclose friend of the Hapsburg Empress Maria Theresia, who was also a holder of the previously mentioned Order ofthe Golden Fleece, and one of the four national superiors in Europe of the Bavarian Illuminati. Count Kolwrat,known also as Numenius in the Illuminati, came from a Czech noble family that had a prominent role in the historyand administration of their native Kingdom of Bohemia, and he was regarded as one of the most suitable membersto participate in the strategically important Masonic Congress that took place in Paris in 1785, organized 4 yearsbefore the start of the French Revolution, by the Rite of The Philalethes, created in the 1770s by the Loge desAmis Réunis founded by Charles Pierre Paul Savalette de Lange (1746-1797), who was also a member of theIlluminati under the code name Bias, and captain of the National Guard and adjutant of Lafayette in Paris.According to the Illuminati chief executive officer, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode’s travel journal, some of thePhilalethes comprised a secret core of Illuminati members, called the “Philadelphians.”[337] The powerful lodgecounted amongst its influential members, Maximilien de Robespierre (1758-1794), one of the best-known figuresof the French Revolution. Count Kolwrat went to Paris on behalf of Adam Weishaupt, to lobby French leaders tosponsor these congresses so they could propagate their Illuminist plans. Attendants included also the WorshipfulMaster of the Loge Neuf Soeurs, where Benjamin Franklin, served as Worshipful Master, from 1779 to 1781.​ Then there were among the Austrian Illuminati, in the same period Joseph von Sonnenfels, a Professor atVienna University; Gottfried von Swieten, President of the Commission for Education; Count Johann Cobenzl, laterForeign Minister of Austria; and the poet Alxinger. The Order had also many lodges sprinkled about many smallerAustrian towns, including Innsbrück, as well as Italian cities under Austrian control at the time such as Milan.Austria was once a stronghold for the Illuminati, and Carl Kerner, an expert himself on the history of Austrian secretsocieties and the original Illuminati, remembered the warnings of the late Adam Weishaupt (1748-1830), thefounder, that suggested to change the name of the order, to avoid persecution, after their plans were exposed, andthey were outlawed from the mid-1780s when internal documents of the Illuminati of Bavaria were seized byBavarian police authorities.  ​ According to Theodor Reuss, upon his final separation with Engel in June 1902, Kellner finally contactedhim, and the two agreed to proceed with the establishment of the Ordo Templi Orientis aka O.T.O., by seekingauthorizations to work the various rites of high-grade Masonry. Reuss and Kellner prepared a brief manifesto fortheir order in 1903, which was published later in the Fringe Masonic/Illuminati publication known as TheOriflamme. Whether Kellner ever lived to see the O.T.O. become more than just these early plans is debatable,since he died in 1905, not long after the first announcements were made, but his obsession with sexual magic anddeviant occult practices, that were prevalent at that time in the Theosophical milieu in Austria, inspired what willbecome one of the most influential Illuminati sects of the last one hundred years, proving once again Austria hasalways been used by the Illuminati network for the most uncompromising experiments for a very long time.It also seems that Engel and Reuss, did not abandon the project to bring together the Illuminati inGermany and Austria, as a bulletin named Ordensanzeigerder Illuminatenorderns, was published before World WarI, and in 1912 there was a Johannite lodge in Berlin named “Adam Weishaupt to the pyramid,” that worked under aGrand Lodge of the Illuminati-Freemasons of Germany, that seemed to have established another Lodge in 1910called “Adam Weishaupt to the light of the Rhine” in Cologne, but after World War I, Leopold Engel immigrated toAustria,[338] where the Johannite heresy, that venerates John the Baptist above Jesus Christ, has always been morepowerful than in Germany. Comte le Couteulx de Canteleu (1827-1910), known for his work on secret societies, inwhich he points out all the links between Freemasonry and the French Revolution, explains the importance of the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Johannite heresy for Neotemplars, Freemasons, and the Illuminati, in his book, Les sectes et sociétés secrètespolitiques et religieuses, where he writes:At the time of the Crusades, there existed, in the East, \"the religious Christians who called themselvesbrothers of the East, and whose doctrine it is necessary to test to understand the future beliefs of the Templarsand the Johannites.\"[339]​ Adding later that:The mysteries of the Egyptian initiation, transmitted to the Jews by Moses, to the Christians by Jesus Christ,were religiously preserved by the successors of Saint John the apostle, and these mysteries and theseinitiations, regenerated by the evangelical initiation, were a sacred deposit, guarded by the brothers of theEast.[340]​ It is worth mentioning the fact that even if Comte le Couteulx de Canteleu was a fervent Anti-Mason himself,he was also the grandson of influential Freemason Jean-Barthélemy Le Couteulx de Canteleu, one of the founders ofthe Banque de France, the central bank of France. In 1819, Vincent Lombard of Langres, who was once close to thepreviously mentioned Count Kolowrat and served after the French Revolution as an ambassador of France inHolland, and as judge member of the Court of Cassation, disguising himself under the name Ancien Illuminé,published a very revealing book on the Illuminati, entitled La Vérité sur les Sociétés secrètes en Allemagne (Paris:1819)[341]. The Ancien Illuminé offered a more realistic interpretation of the Illuminati than most publicationsaround at the time. First of all, Ancien Illuminé states that the “Machiavellian code” developed by Weishauptreflected a “profound immorality.”[342]The Ancien Illuminé also gave Weishaupt sarcastic praise, when he saysWeishaupt’s “genius” was not only his “ranting about abuses and prejudice,” but also his ability to make a “group offools” come to his school of wisdom to graze upon his “many words.”[343]Weishaupt exaggerated to them about “theevil into gigantic forms” of the monarchy while filing “young heads with selfish ambition.”[344] Ancien Illuminé,who had been part of the Bavarian Illuminati and still believed in some of the elements of their ideology, appearedto agree that the power of religion needed to be broken, just like Weishaupt wanted, but in doing so, a newintolerance should not emerge which would deny anyone the religious vocation that they seek.Weishaupt sought to capture, by the influence of the Order of which he was chief, the power that was usurpedby religion over common sense and human reason. If it had been more open and better managed, an attackagainst monasticism in Bavaria might have been a blessing. But this was not the only abuse upon which warwas declared. Rather, a spirit of intolerance was taken toward the monastic life itself which [instead] shouldhave been allowed for men to prefer as well as any other social existence.[345]​ Ancien Illuminé seems to have had a softer approach to the Antichristian mission of the Illuminati, criticizesWeishaupt, because he says the Illuminati founder confused the abuses of religion with religion itself. It is fine to“repress abuse,” he said, but Ancien Illuminé also says it is wrong to attack religion which at the same time, “givesdirection to society and forms its base.”[346]As a consequence of Weishaupt going beyond necessity he rightly said,“Weishaupt and his adepts had become the most dangerous enemies of their country.”[347]Ancien Illuminé alsodisparaged the irreligion of Weishaupt’s followers, even if he was not particularly concerned about the Christianinstitutions of Europe. Thus, the Ancien Illuminé offered criticism primarily only to the extent that the Illuminatiused Machiavellian schemes, the old Illuminatus, Vincent Lombard of Langres, also disliked taking away thefreedom of religion of anyone, even though he sympathized with the destruction of the old religious system. Hiscriticisms were well-measured, more sober-minded than Weishaupt’s. Yet, the Ancien Illuminé exposes intimatedetails of their founding lodges in France, and their involvement with the French Revolution, through German andAustrian agents of the Illuminati Order.At the end of his book, Ancien Illuminé, the Illuminati renounced their association andreturned Weishaupt to obscurity. But we all know that is only partly true, as some of them will simply operate underother names, but his work provides nevertheless a sober insight into the fact that the Illuminati as they originallyexisted had fully renounced their association, and were permanently disbanded as of 1819, and some researchers saythe authentic Order of Illuminati was already dissolved in 1993, and that’s why, Theodor Reuss, joined later byLeopold Engel, started to work on reestablishing the Order with its original name in the 1880s. A project that"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"generated controversy in Germany, but found a lot of interested Freemasons in Austria, where Leopold Engeleventually moved after getting into trouble with the German Grand Lodges Freemasonry, that never recognized anyof his lodges that were considered highly “irregular.”​ In 1928, the late Engel published before his death in 1931, Luzifers Bekenntnisse (“The Confessions ofLucifer”), a work that he allegedly received from Lucifer via mediumship, based on the redemption of the fallenangel. In 1949, the Austrian “World League of the Illuminati,” was revived after the war, as the outer court of theFraternitas Saturni Illuminati sect by Eduard Kobel, who amassed the titles of Grand Chancellor -General,Chancellor of the Austrian Province, Grand Magus 5°, and the highest degree of the Illuminati Order (Rex).[348]Suddenly things were moving forward for Austrian Freemasonry and the Illuminati in that period, only one yearearlier in August 1948, in Bad Hofgastein, a market town in the district of St. Johann im Pongau, in the Austrianstate of Salzburg, there was an important meeting between the late Nazi sympathizer Theodor Innitzer (1875-1955), Archbishop of Vienna, and a Cardinal of the Catholic Church, and the Grand Master of the Johannine rite ofAustrian Freemasonry (Grand Lodge of Vienna for Austria), Bernhard Scheichelbauer. The Archbishop of Viennawanted to personally verify if the Austrian Masons, who were re-founding the first Austrian Grand Lodge after thewar, were not atheists and what kind of beliefs they had. He must have been positively impressed because four yearslater, the Austrian Freemasons started an official relation with the Apostolic Nuncio to Austria, a diplomatic post ofthe Holy See, but Pope Pius XII, who was still a traditionalist, before the Masonic take over of his successor,rejected this initiative.[349] But things will change with the Second Vatican Council, and in the end, the experimentalnature of Austrian Freemasonry, and their constant link to the progressive heretical ideals of the Illuminati, havereached the highest levels of the Vatican. For this reason, in the last few years, Father Michael HeinrichWeninger, a long time Austrian Freemason, known for his work in reconciling Freemasonry with the CatholicChurch, has been placed in a key position at the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, that is being usedto usher in the One World Religion.Father Weniger is no ordinary priest, but a former Austrian diplomat and a member of the Academy of theIlluminati with its headquarters in Piazza di Spagna, Rome, who was ordained in 2009 following the death of hiswife but is also openly a Mason and the chaplain of three Austrian Masonic lodges. You can’t make this stuff up theCatholic Church is finally showing their true Masonic colors to the world. In the August-September 2020 issue ofInside the Vatican, there is an interesting article on the increasing toleration, if not outright approval, of overt“Catholic” Freemasons by the Vatican II Church. The piece is entitled, “New Openings to Make MasonicMembership Permissible?” and is written by the magazine’s editor-in-chief, Dr. Robert Moynihan who writes:In 2013, a French priest was removed from office and stripped of his public ministry for refusing to resignfrom Freemasonry. By contrast, in February 2020 an Austrian priest and Vatican official, quite open about hisMasonic membership, held a press conference to launch his new book about the alleged compatibility of“regular” (British-recognized) Masonry and the Catholic faith, with little if any fear of punishment. [350]​ So, who is this “Father” Weninger, anyway? He used to be married and served in the Austrian diplomaticservice. In 2009 he was widowed, and a mere two years later he was suddenly ordained a priest by Vienna’s infernalCardinal, Christoph Schönborn, a member of the Austrian elite I mentioned earlier on, concerning the late Otto vonHabsburg and “Great Reseter” Klaus Schwab. Schonborn appears to have connections with Freemasonry and, in anycase, is certainly doing the anti-Catholic work of the Masons. Incredibly enough, it was Pope Benedict XVI, thesame Joseph Ratzinger, who had reiterated the impermissibility of joining the Masons, who originally appointedFather Weninger in November 2012, to serve on the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, where hecontributes to the dialogue with Islam, that is crucial for the Jesuit One World Religion project. Quite rightly,therefore, does Dr. Moynihan observe that “it appears action is no longer being taken to discipline priests andprominent laymen who are known Masons, or bar them from Holy Communion.” Not only that — they are nowopenly promoted! And why not? The highest-ranking Freemason in Vatican City is, after all, Pope Francis. Nowonder the Jesuit Pope holds honorary membership of the Rotary Club in his native Buenos Aires (full of formerNazis), and Masonic institutions worldwide have been openly supporting him since his election as “Pope” in 2013,treating him like a “Brother.”After all, Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati strategy of secretly binding hands of world leaders was preciselydesigned to mimic the Jesuits, and now that we have a Jesuit and a Freemason as Pope, the project to end all religionand private property, as Weishaupt wanted, can now finally take place. Weishaupt had laid out the end-goals of the"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Great Reset already back then in these quite succinct terms:To reinstate man in his primitive right of equality and liberty we must begin by destroying all religion andcivil society, and finish by the destruction of all property . . . A time shall come when man shall acknowledge noother law but the great book of nature. This revolution will be the work of the secret societies.[351]​ At the time of Weishaupt, Freemasonry contained within itself a sort of antidote against Illuminati influence.For the general rule of all Freemasonry, there is no discussion in the lodge of either religion or politics. As a result,the Illuminati were only able to influence a minority of Freemasons, but things have changed since then, and evenmainstream Freemasonry, as well as the Church, is now fully politicized by the progressive ideals of the Illuminati. This is an extract from Adam’s Weishaupt PREPARATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE TO PARTICIPATE INGOVERNING THE ORDER OF THE ILLUMINATI, to better understand the manipulative beliefs of their elitecircle:My Brother!You have declared that you regard the institute of the Illustrious Order up to the Lesser Illuminatus degree,which you have received, as important, noble, and worthy of your collaboration. We, therefore, welcome you tothe smaller circle of operative workers! With confidence, we can assert that the Order deserves this sentimentand that you shall never regret having become one of its active members. Now you know what is essential, themain focus of our association’s Superiors and the manner in which we perpetuate it – and that in order tospread truth and light we must first set up preparatory schools and educate men according to our principles.However, before you direct such an enterprise in your parts, before you can proliferate the Order and link it tothe Freemasons, it is necessary that any conceivable doubt or mistrust on either side be fully resolved if indeedany still exists. You still have two Illuminati degrees before you, one of which is concerned with the mostprecise knowledge of man, and another which, in addition to various disclosures, demonstrates its practicalapplications for the members of the Order.[352] Then follows the Mysteries Class, in which your spirit will findnourishment as well as the opportunity to teach and learn. However, neither you nor we are served well if webestow these degrees on you one after the other before you are ready to use such knowledge for the benefit ofother men. The lowest Class is the Order’s foundation. Once you have established this preparatory school andthen entrusted the worthiest among the Minervals with the care of the weaker ones, thus placing the directionof the Minerval Class into other hands and discharging yourself of this duty, then you have the leisure, merit,and right to learn more about the Order and participate in its government. Until then we shall postponeeverything else to avoid confusion, skip the other degrees, and look ahead to give you a first glance at thelarger plan of operations. If we could not agree on the latter, it would be fruitless for both parties to dwell onthe theoretical part, as our main focus is to be of practical use for the world. A society desiring to spreadwisdom and virtue in this corrupted world is bound to encounter obstacles. The Order has taken the mostreliable measures to overcome these and to gain power over evil; should we, my Brother! share this power withyou, and if you wish to become a pillar of the just cause, we must better acquaint ourselves with one another inone more aspect. Our work must be accomplished with prudence and caution as well as honesty andunselfishness. You can easily see that an association resting on such a solid foundation is and must be verypowerful in secret in order to remove the obstacles barring the progress of wisdom, and that it does not sufficeto have noble principles alone but that he who has the power to implement them must also choose good meansfor this end. Therefore, it is in the interest of both parties to ascertain:I. On our part, that the man whom we allow to stand at the helm with us uses the instruction and meansplaced in his hands in a most unselfish manner and for the advantage of the whole.II. On your part, that you can be assured that we seek nothing other than universal felicity and that we planno dangerous treason. –In a word, we must ask one another about our political principles, and you must know our plan ofoperations. Or we ask you: ‘Which measures would you take to remove the obstacles hindering us todisseminate our knowledge and intentions with which you are familiar?’ You then ask us: ‘How do you intendto make the good cause prevail with this legion of well-trained men?’[353]​ For this purpose, the future elite members of the order were made to answer seventeen questions, among themthese three that I regard as particularly relevant:"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"IX. Would such a society be evil if it were to contrive situations in which the greatest monarchs of the worldwould be rendered incapable of doing evil?

Wells to Dr. Fauci, the Twisted Ideology of the NWO is Upon Us In this unprecedented reality, secretly driven by the occult forces I have described until now, we shouldn’t besurprised if a Vatican document issued jointly by the Pontifical Academy for Life and the Vatican COVID-19commission, seems to think you can ignore the teachings of the church in blind favor of alleged scientific solutionsand never-ending lockdowns. In January 2022, Allison Pearson from Telegraph recounted her anti-lockdown viewsfrom early on, and how so many people who implemented draconian policies are now running from them and theirresponsibility.[354] All this insanity is taking place mainly because the Jesuit-led New World Order is upon us,dictated by such evil figures as Jesuit-trained Dr. Anthony Fauci.​ At a Senate hearing on May 11th, 2021, Dr. Fauci, who was a special guest at a Vatican virtual healthconference only a month earlier, denied ever having funded “gain of function” research at the Wuhan Institute ofVirology (WIV), despite clear documentation proving otherwise. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergyand Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told a House Appropriations subcommittee that the money was funneled to theChinese lab through the non-profit EcoHealth Alliance directed by Dr. Peter Daszak, to fund only, “a modestcollaboration with very respectable Chinese scientists who were world experts on coronavirus.” But Fauciemphatically denied, in a typical Jesuit fashion (they are professional liars), that the money went toward so-called“gain of function” research, which he described as “taking a virus that could infect humans and making it eithermore transmissible and/or pathogenic for humans.”However, this was a lie by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who argued even publicly that conducting experiments oncontagious viruses to increase their potency was worth the risk, even if the work could accidentally lead to apandemic. ​ On August 27th, 2021, the U.S. intelligence community issued a 502-word summary of the conclusions drawnup by the joint investigation ordered by President Biden in late May. Conspicuously absent from the brief statement"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"were any indications that the evidence presented in testimony to Congress had been part of the intelligencecommunity analysis - at least not in the unclassified version that was released. In this context, the lifting of the gain-of-function (GOF) moratorium in late 2017, via the Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight framework(P3CO), has allowed GOF research with SARS-like coronaviruses to resume with very few practical limits. Inparticular, the absence of clear definitions of GOF, creative interpretations of the guidelines, and rather discretionarydecisions to refer research projects or not, all contributed to reducing the effectiveness of the P3CO framework –even though other agencies of the U.S. Federal government actively maintained the GOF standards. D.R.A.S.T.IC.(Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team Investigating COVID-19) a loose collection of internet activistsinvestigating the origins of COVID-19 became aware of documents that show that EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) inconcert wIth the Wuhan Institute of Virology were looking towards implementing an advanced human pathogenicityBatCoV research project that qualifies as GoF, in a grant proposal submitted to a funding proposal call by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) ALREADY in the spring of 2018. The EHA / WIVproposal (named ‘DEFUSE’) was ultimately rejected for full funding (but leaving open the door for partial funding),in part because it skirted the GOF guidelines.​ Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s chief medical advisor, wrote in a scientific article for the American Societyfor Microbiology (ASM), in October 2012, about the public health benefit of gain-of-function viral experiments ifthere is a significant oversight. In the article in question, first reported by The Australian, Fauci also noted that apause on such studies should continue until researchers can figure out how to do them more transparently.Interestingly enough, in March 2021, the Wuhan Institute of Virology deleted all mention of its collaboration withthe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, directed by Dr. Anthony Fauci. It also deleted descriptionsof gain-of-function research on the SARS virus. The elite wants to hide the truth and to bow down to their rules,they want to destroy Capitalism in favor of communism on a global scale, leading us to an Abyss, that seems moreevident in this increasingly Satanic reality, that has also an invisible side, where we find demons, psychic vampires,psychic leeches, and all ghastly forms of evil operating with impunity around us.Some will wonder at this point if, in the current scenario, our freedom will ever be returned to us inthe future. Well, not according to Hollywood or the World Health Organization. In the first major feature film to bemade during the pandemic in Los Angeles, “Songbird” set in a not-so-distant dystopian future, we find a world in2023 still under siege from a coronavirus that has gone through several deadly mutations. Something that is,unfortunately, happening already, as the never-ending parade of new and improved variants keep on coming, alongwith the strategy of tension of the infamous and willingly incompetent World Health Organization, that haswarned us that a much worse pandemic is already around the corner, stating to a shocked world that the currentpandemic is ”not necessarily the big one,” and that we must rebel against this bleak and screwed-up future, beforeit’s too late and understand once and for all that the Vatican Jesuits and their reign of terror must be stopped.For this reason, a growing number of Italians are organizing a once-in-a-lifetime event at the end ofOctober 2022, to liberate Italy and the world from the lies and manipulation of the Jesuits and occupy the Vaticanindefinitely. Let’s hope they do it, if not the elite will move faster and faster towards the final stage of their “NewWorld Order,” a word coined by an illustrious and controversial Herbert George Wells, better known as H. G.Wells (1866- 1946), who was the author of the 1946 manual for the elite entitled, The New World Order, whoseoriginal title was: The New World Order: Whether It Is Attainable, How It Can Be Attained, and What Sort of Worlda World at Peace Will Have to Be. Wells published in The New World Order his first version of a human rightsdeclaration, which was a precursor to his work on the Sankey Declaration of the Rights of Man (1940).In 1947, both declarations became used as advisory works by the United Nations Commission on Human Rightsfor drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).[355] H. G. Wells was a member of the infamous Fabian Society from 1903 to 190, an organization historicallyrelated to radicalism, a left-wing liberal tradition, but Wells eventually turned critic of its operations, particularly inhis 1905 paper, “The Faults of the Fabian,” in which he claimed the Society in question was a middle-class talkingshop. [356] He later parodied the society in his 1910 novel The New Machiavelli. Biographer David Smith called TheNew Machiavelli, “Wells's most autobiographical novel”[357] and some critics have considered The NewMachiavelli, “the beginning of the retreat of Wells the storyteller. It was the first ominous eruption of thosemagnificent moments of self-assertion which were to disintegrate the novelist in him.”[358]But that’s not entirelytrue, as Wells had already started nine years earlier his groundbreaking non-fiction futuristic work, with his firstnon-fiction bestseller Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life andThought (1901), that was originally serialized in a magazine subtitled, “An Experiment in Prophecy.[359]”Incredibly, the experiment he conducted not only influenced his contemporaries but still influences us.​ Cynthia Chung Editor-in-Chief and co-founder of the Rising Tide Foundation (Montreal, Canada), says that“It is no coincidence that our entertainment industry today, so heavily saturated with the influence of Wells’"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"propaganda, is obsessed with the theme of a post-apocalyptic world.” Already back in 1901, the great writer andsocial critic attempted to predict the future in his book cited above, commonly referred to as Anticipations, where hewrote:It has become apparent that whole masses of the human population are, as a whole, inferior in their claimupon the future, to other masses, that they cannot be given opportunities or trusted with power as the superiorpeoples are trusted, that their characteristic weaknesses are contagious and detrimental to the civilizing fabric,and that their range of incapacity tempts and demoralizes the strong. To give them equality is to sink to theirlevel, to protect and cherish them is to be swamped in their fecundity.​ Later in The Shape of Things to Come: The Ultimate Revolution, published in 1933, H.G Wells, wrote of thefuture predicting, rather optimistically, likes Cynthia Chung points out, that there will be another World War in justa few years, followed by epidemic and famine. In this fictional future, the war continues for thirty years into the1960s, despite that people have forgotten why they started fighting, humanity enters a new Dark Age.[360] This is abrief synopsis, found online, of the book in question:A long economic slump causes a major war that leaves Europe devastated and threatened by plague. Indecades of chaos with much of the world reverting to medieval conditions, pilots and technicians formerlyserving in various nations' air forces maintain a network of functioning airfields. Around this nucleus,technological civilization is rebuilt, with the pilots and other skilled technicians eventually seizing worldwidepower and sweeping away the remnants of the old nation-states. A benevolent dictatorship is set up, paving theway for world peace by abolishing national divisions, enforcing the English language, promoting scientificlearning, and outlawing religion. The enlightened world citizens can depose the dictators peacefully and go onto breed a new race of super-talents, able to maintain a permanent utopia.[361]​ Many of Wells' short-term predictions would come true, such as the aerial bombing of whole cities presentedin more detail than in his previous The War in the Air and the eventual development of weapons of mass destruction.Others, such as the withering of state-power and the dissolution of Islam, have not yet come to pass, and, of course,we all know the second World War ended in 1945 but did it really end? Adrian Bonenberger, who is a journalist andessayist with extensive experience covering national security and international relations, came out in 2016 with thefollowing conclusion I partly agree with:World War Two never stopped because it was a war fought over whether repressive anti-enlightenmenttotalitarianism would rule Europe and the world, or whether humanism and western values (even thoseespoused haphazardly as in republican oligarchies like the United States) would hold sway. And while we havesaid that we won WWII and the Nazis lost, or that the Soviet Union won WWII and the Nazis lost, the truth is,the intellectual and ideological conflict at the heart of WWII never disappeared. On the one hand, it didn’tdisappear because the Soviet Union was a more enthusiastic and popular if less well-organized version of NaziGermany (especially after 1945, when ethnolinguistic nationalism drove Russian ethnic cleansing)—and theUSSR lasted well into the 20th century. So all the places that we neglected to liberate from the Soviet Unionwere places where WWII didn’t have a chance to end, at least until the USSR’s collapse. Because of activewars today, to some of those places (like Ukraine), we might as well have never fought WWII in the first place.[362]​ However, in his fictional account, H. G. Wells writes that in the last bid for victory, the enemy deploys abiological weapon resulting in a “wandering sickness,” that will produce the first zombies, and by 1970 the globalpopulation will have dropped to a little under one billion. Though all this is depicted as horrific, like Cynthia Chungalso notices, this event, is at the same time depicted as a necessity – a “great reset,” to restore the “balance” so tospeak of humanity. That’s because H. G. Wells was part of the elite of the New World Order, a definition he coinedin the last years of his life, for the title of a non-fiction book published by Secker & Warburg in January 1940.​ But let’s go back to The Shape of Things to Come: The Ultimate Revolution, where with this reducedpopulation, the elite that manages a bureaucratic system under the form of a “World Government” can finally beginto build back together from the chaos something different (the so-called “Build Back Better” framework comes tomind), a new phase of human evolution, as a biologically superior species (transhumans?) after the inferior havebeen culled by war and disease. This early sci-fi fantasy from H. G. Wells, and the subjects developed in it includingthat of depopulation, are the central theme to everything he wrote after, including his works of non-fiction like New"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"World Order. Like Cynthia Chung says, in her article on the matter, that brings to light the real evil nature of H. G.Wells’ work:The subject on ways to reduce the world population was a troubling dilemma for Wells...not the reducingpart, but the thought that there would be those so foolish as to forbid it. You see, it was considered by some thatthe human species had found itself in a crisis by the 1900s. Europe, up until the 17th century had a populationsize that never exceeded roughly 100 million. But nearly doubled to 180 million in the 18th century anddoubled again to 390 million in the 19thcentury. H. G. Wells wrote of this “the extravagant swarm of newbirths” as “the essential disaster of the nineteenth century.” Not war, not disease, not starvation, not abjectpoverty, but population growth was determined as the disaster of an entire century.Today the world population is 7.9 billion people, a far cry from Wells’ hopeful 1 billion.However, there is good news! The worldometers.info site predicts a decreasing net change in populationgrowth, such that by the year 2050 the yearly change will be 0.50% of what it is now! In other words, the rateof population growth will be cut in half 29 years from now! Those are striking projections and would entail amassive cap on growth! Obviously, this is a projection based on the presumed success of “educationalreforms.” Though I do wonder...what will we do if not all of the individuals agree to abide by these reforms?And what will we do if not all of the nations agree to abide by these reforms? Will we enforce it nonetheless,and if so...by what methods? [363]​ H. G. Wells started his journey towards becoming an inspiration for the entire elite of The New World Orderas a young boy when he won a scholarship to study at the prestigious Normal School of Science (now called theRoyal College of Science). His subject of choice was biology and his teacher, and quickly thereafter, the mentor wasnone other than Thomas Huxley, otherwise known as “Darwin’s bulldog” (his words), grandfather of JulianHuxley who in 1951 coined the term transhumanism,[364] for the view that humans should better themselvesthrough science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the socialenvironment. Let’s also remember that Julian’s brother Aldous Leonard Huxley, was the diabolical mastermind ofMK-Ultra.          So, H. G. Wells was connected to a family, that from the very beginningpromoted and drove the acceptance of the occult theory of evolution, and ultimately, transhumanism.[365] ThroughThomas Huxley, Wells’ conception of the nature of mankind was formed, with its foundation built upon thephilosophies of Charles Darwin and Thomas Malthus that form the very basis for his ethics, or non-ethics. Amongthe plethora of books Wells wrote, the previously mentioned Anticipations from 1901 contains many details on theupcoming system of world governance and scientific control that we see manifesting in front of us every day. Hewrites the “vicious, helpless, and pauper masses” have appeared, spreading as the railway systems have spread, andrepresenting an integral part of the process of industrialization, like the waste product of a healthy organism.” Forthese, “great useless masses of people” Wells adopts the term “People of the Abyss,” and he predicts that the“nation that most resolutely picks over, educates, sterilizes, exports or poisons its People of the Abyss” will bein the ascendant. In this case, I guess H. G. Wells would have probably loved Communist China, where the founderof Thelema, Aleister Crowley, (who initiated Wells to the mysteries of the Illuminati), finished his Abramelin ritualand summoned his Holy Guardian Angel. Crowley explains that the Abyss is the great gulf or void between thephenomenal world of manifestation and its noumenal source. Crowley, who embraced the concept of the Abyss,because of its Satanic nature, describes it in the following way, in his Little Essays Toward Truth:In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack thesubstratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane Delusions. Now theAbyss being thus the great storehouse of Phenomena, it is the source of all impressions.​ On a practical level, Crowley, even published a series of detailed instructions on how to reach the Abyss,saying it prepared the student for the mystical experience that Crowley called Shivadarshana. And according to abook entitled Green Gold: The Tree of Life, Marijuana in Magic and Religion by Chris Bennett, Lynn Osburn, andJudy Osburn, Crowley initiated not only H. G. Wells into the mysteries of hashish, but also Aldous Huxley into thevisionary experience of peyote in a Berlin hotel room. The source for this is given also elsewhere from Francis King,a well-known, writer on the occult, and an authority on Aleister Crowley’s work. Going back to Wells, whenreading Anticipations, it is difficult not to be reminded of later works that might have been inspired by it, such asOrwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where a scientific, ruthless elite (Dr. Fauci...) gains control"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"of society - in the case of H. G. Wells the so-called “New Republic” that proclaims altruistic motives to the generalpopulation - and directs the affairs of mankind in a very similar way to today’s elite. Anticipations was one of thefirst books dedicated to surveying this glim future, a book we can almost consider a warning. BinghamtonUniversity history professor and futurist W. Warren Wagar writes regarding Wells' Anticipations,Anticipations ranged widely in its subject matter, from the future of transport to the future of world order...Wells looked ahead to the first aircraft and too broad highways teeming with automobiles, busses, and trucks.Suburbia would triumph over city and countryside... one vast unbroken sprawl of middle-class life would reachfrom Boston to Washington. [Wells] foresaw the collapse of capitalism and the nation-state system in greattechnologically advanced total wars that the tycoons and the politicians could not, ultimately, understand orcontrol. Power would slip through their fingers. They would be swiftly replaced by the technically competent,by scientists and engineers and managers, who would learn from their errors and build a world state of peaceand plenty.[366]​ Anticipations contain many startling predictions that have come to pass to one degree or another. In this book,Wells bluntly states the goals and intentions of his envisioned, “New Republic” that will, among many other things,“...have an idea that will make killing worth the while,\" and inflict upon deviants, \"good scientifically caused pain,that will leave nothing but a memory.” Wells even predicts the rise of a union of European states complete with“...homologation of laws and coinage and measures...” through which \"...the final peace of the world may be assuredforever.” This “peace” however, means certain enslavement for a large portion of mankind. Wells states - again, thisis written in 1901 - that the “New Republic” will,...aim to establish, and it will at last, though probably only after a second-century has passed, establish aworld-state with a common language and a common rule. All over the world its roads, its standards, its laws,and its apparatus of control will run.[367]​ The ethical system laid out in Wells’ “New Republic” forbids the further growth of the “People of theAbyss.” In the past, Nature killed these off, and in some cases killing will still be necessary. And we should not beappalled by this task, as per Mr. Wells. Death for such people will mean merely “the end of the bitterness of failure,the merciful obliteration of weak and silly and pointless things.” Clearly, the effecting of this will be morallyjustifiable according to Wells:The new ethics will hold life to be a privilege and a responsibility, not a sort of night refuge for base spiritsout of the void; and the alternative in right conduct between living fully, beautifully, and efficiently will be todie. For a multitude of contemptible and silly creatures, fear-driven and helpless and useless, unhappy, orhateful happy in the midst of squalid dishonor, feeble, ugly, inefficient, born of unrestrained lusts, andincreasing and multiplying through sheer incontinence and stupidity, the men of the New Republic will havelittle pity and less benevolence. [emphasis added]​ If “the whole tenor of a man’s actions” shows him to be unfit to live, they will exterminate him. They will notbe squeamish about inflicting death because they will have in his sick vision a fuller sense of the possibilities of life.But remember the killing that Wells describes, will not be needlessly brutal but almost invisible like the presentpandemic/biological warfare. In 1938, Wells’ War of the Worlds was broadcasted as a radio drama and narrated bynone other than Orson Welles, an exceptional director, actor, screenwriter, and producer, who is remembered for hisinnovative work in countless radio, theatre, and film productions, who will also star 11 years later as CountCagliostro (one of the real Grand Masters of the Illuminati), in the now-forgotten film “Black Magic” (1949).During the broadcast, it had not made itself clear to its audience that it was a radio drama and not the actual news.Suffice to say, the reporting of a man-eating alien invasion caused quite a panic in its London boroughs, and I amsure Britain's War Propaganda Bureau, whom H.G. Wells had worked for, got quite a chuckle out of it. It was greatnews for them, for it showed how easy it would be to control the narrative, even if it were to be carried out to anabsurd degree. It confirmed to them that the public will believe anything just like they do today, as the last variant ofthis infinite pandemic will eventually be called the New World Order. Wells wrote of the panic caused by the radiodrama in the London boroughs, and the following that should put chills down your spine:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"If one could have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London, every northwardand eastward road running out of the infinite tangle of streets would have seemed stippled black with thestreaming fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress...Never before in the history of theworld had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together...without order and with a goal, sixmillion people, unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,of the massacre of mankind. [368]​ This whole scenario brings back to my mind a very old film by Alfred Hitchcock entitled “The Rope” (1948),where two Harvard students murder one of their friends as an experiment in committing the “perfect murder” and adisplay of their intellectual superiority. They stuff the body in a large chest in the middle of the dining room andhold a party, the idea being that their guests would be too daft as to figure out that they are dining in a room with afresh corpse, that is, everyone except Rupert Cadell (played by James Stewart), a former teacher of theirs. Rupert,they recognize will be their real challenge and their greatest proof of intellectual superiority if they succeed inpulling the wool over his eyes. It was Rupert who taught the two men this manner of thinking that “murder is acrime for most men, but a privilege for the few.” This is reasoned by the belief that “moral concepts of good and evildo not pertain to the superior being.” This subject is discussed at the dinner party, the guests think at first Rupert iskidding, but he assures them that the world would be a better place if the superior were permitted to commit murderand that such a murder would be an “art form.” He states, in a way typical of the elite, that unfortunately rules theworld today, “think of what this would mean for unemployment, poverty, waiting in long lines.” He thinks an openseason for murder would be too much and suggests shorter durations such as “cut a throat week” or “strangulationday.”As the evening progresses, Rupert, the astute man that he is, observes a series of odd behaviorfrom the two men. David (the murdered young man) was invited to the party, his father and his fiancé are among theguests, and there is a growing concern for why David has not shown up. Long story short – after all the guests hadleft, only Rupert and the two young killers remain in the apartment. Rupert discovers that they have murdered David(who was also a student of Rupert’s), and he opens the chest to find the body. Horrified and disgusted, he asks “whydid you do it?” They, of course, responded, “We simply acted out what you always talked about.” Confronted withthe reality of his words, Rupert feels ashamed, being partially responsible for this macabre scene. However, Rupertstates, “there was always something deep within me that prevented me from ever acting out my words,” in otherwords, he never thought it possible that anyone would do it. It is at that moment that Rupert realizes that it is not thesuperior being who is capable of murder, but rather the criminally insane. He finally understands that the idea ofpurging the world of its “inferiors,” would rid the world of its most loving and moral beings, their traits regarded asintolerably foolish and weak. In the end, we would be left with the worst of humankind, a human race that hadcannibalized itself.[369]    ​ Today, we are risking a purge, and we are all no matter what the color of our skin, the “people of the Abyss”described by the early H.G Wells, as inferior. The supposed superiority of the scientific elite, who have supposedlypurified themselves of ancient, outdated ideas, and restraining morality, like the infamous Dr. Fauci, places them ina position of dominance, just like in H. G. Wells 1901 book, where a “reconstructed ethical system” gives rise to a“new ethics” in the so-called “New Republic” aka the New World Order. For this reason, is important that we find away to stop all this madness before we lose forever the very soul of humanity. Wells writes regarding this newethics, “...the ethical system of these men of the “New Republic” the ethical system which will dominate the worldstate, will be shaped primarily to favor the procreation of what is fine and efficient... and to check the procreation ofbase and servile types...” And regarding death in this context, Wells, writes that it must be called to the aid ofmankind, “And the method that nature has followed hitherto in the shaping of the world, whereby weakness wasprevented from propagating weakness, and cowardice and feebleness were saved from the accomplishment of theirdesires... the method that must in some cases still be called into the help of man, is death.” A “reconstructed ethicalsystem” governs the elite of the New Republic which allows for the killing of lesser types as a greater service to thewhole of mankind, but a more selfish motivation of total domination seems to cut to the core of the elite.Remember the men of the “New Republic” described by Wells have a “moral justification” for everyaction, just like people like Dr. Fauci seem to have. Scientific management, and a compulsive desire for efficiency,guide their hands and their mission in eliminating part of the human population, for what they ultimately think, intheir twisted vision of things, an act of good for the future of our race. Wells brushed shoulders and had intimaterelationships with some of the most prominent people of his day, the elite... and for this reason, he had the uncannyability to predict the future shape of the world. That is partly what happened to me before I left The New WorldOrder, and I started to expose them in the fall of 2006. Unfortunately, Wells, a social climber, and the son of"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"domestic servants turned small shopkeepers, never rejected the elite he had managed to join, and supported them andtheir evil plans until the end of his life.Going back to what is happening today, myself and other researchers like Charles Hugh Smith, author of oneof the top alternative financial sites, are struck by the similarities between the conflict-torn mid-1600s and thepresent global climate change that looks a bit like the little ice age in the 1600s, where political upheavals and warsintertwined civil and imperial conflicts. Global Crisis, War, Climate Change. and Catastrophe made the 17thCentury a complex era that disrupted regimes and empires from England to China, in a scenario that inevitablybrings back to mind the previously mentioned work of H. G. Wells. Climate change naturally produced by “TheLittle Ice Age”, generated scarcities of grain in a time of burgeoning human populations, and as in the present day,everyone assumed ample harvests would continue forever, but nature is not a steady-state system, and cycles are nottamed by our desire for ever-expanding abundance. The fact this kind of “natural” climate change cyclicly occurs inthe history of mankind, should make us understand the lies and manipulation currently at work. And when this kindof thing happens, the various nations of the world respond to scarcity by assessing who's getting the biggest piecesof the shrinking pie. When hunger begets desperation, various dynamics are set into motion, as those without agencyand capital i.e. political and financial power, do whatever they can to get enough to survive, while those holding themajority of political and financial power, jockey to maintain or expand their power. These dynamics are fluid, andprone to non-linear flows, in which relatively small actions unleash enormous consequences, that are notpredictable, but Charles Hugh Smith says that we can discern some repeating patterns in this chaotic swirl, that Ithink can be extremely useful for our better understanding of things to come:1. Private owners of capital (i.e. elites) seek to influence the state to protect/expand their holdings.2. The dispossessed/disenfranchised masses seek redress/succor from the state.3. The geopolitical balance of power becomes increasingly precarious as competition for control ofresources and political power heats up.4. The state's resources are diminished by famine, thedecline of trade, etc. as pressures from geopolitical rivals, elites and the masses are spiking, reducing thestate's ability to respond to the multiple challenges / overlapping crises.5. The overlapping crises reveal and exploit the weaknesses in the political, social, and economicstructures, and in the competing elites.6. Leaders concentrate centralized power in the hands of the few as a coping strategy by reducing theinfluence of broad-based councils, assemblies, etc. This concentration of power at the expense of the many(including lower-level elites who were accustomed to holding some consequential power) increases resistanceof those being cut out of the decision-making and increases the odds of catastrophic errors of judgment in thefew at the top.7. As the state falters or divides into warring factions, the most powerful elites take control of resourcesand power from the state, both as a defensive measure and as a means of exploiting the crisis to theiradvantage.8. Populist leaders arise demanding a fairer distribution of resources and power. The more repressed themasses, the greater the disorder created by this emergence of long-silenced voices.9. Each node seeking to defend or expand its share of resources and power projects and amplifiespersuasive rhetoric, symbols, and beliefs to unify its supporters around deeply held values and aspirations.10. With so many loyalties in play--local, regional, linguistic, political, social, religious, and economic--each node faction seeks to decisively cement loyalties by establishing all-or-nothing hard lines viaideologically \"pure\" rhetoric that demonizes competing factions, effectively dividing the populace into us-and-them camps that leave little middle ground for compromise or negotiation.11. In this fevered competition for loyalty and trustworthy followers willing to sacrifice for the faction,leaders view every advance as evidence that compromise is unnecessary as total victory awaits the next \"win.\"12. Given the grievous losses and potentially devastating consequences of competing factions gainingground, the victors of each battle hasten to take revenge on the losing faction, laying waste and inflictingcruelties that harden the hearts of the surviving losers and inciting their own determination to exact a fullmeasure of revenge when fortunes turn their way.13. Only when the land, people, and treasure are all exhausted does the promise of total victory fade, andthe factions seek some negotiated settlement that leaves whatever power they still have intact lest they loseeverything.14. The eventual settlement could have been reached in the initial stages of disorder, but the leaders of thefactions were too myopic, too confident in their judgment and power, too greedy for more and too hubris-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"soaked to appreciate their weaknesses and the immense pitfalls ahead.[370]​ If you don't discern any of these dynamics in the present, you will not understand where we are heading."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"FIG. 35 –– Documents made available to D.R.A.S.T.I.C. research by an anonymous source."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"FIG. 36 –– Herbert George Wells (1866–1946) is often called the “father of science fiction.”"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"FIG. 37 –– First edition of The New World Order published by Secker & Warburg in January 1940.

Pope Francis signed the new encyclical,after a solemn Mass celebrated in the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, in the region of Umbria in central Italy, onceone of the holiest places in Italy, now instead, one of the more infested with Satanic activity.Catholic priests all over Italy, have been working for the last few years alongside Italian police officers, totackle a rising tide of crimes linked to devil worship in the region. Police say that Satanists are particularly active inPiedmont, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna in the north, and Tuscany, Umbria, Calabria, and Puglia further south.[371]For this reason, the police authorities in Umbria’s capital city of Perugia often attended my conferences andbook presentations in town, and knowing about my expertise on the matter, they would even call me at times as aconsultant, in solving some of the most recent cases that concern churches all over Umbria, that were beingregularly desecrated by Satanists, who mostly steal old relicts and consecrated hosts.[372] But something evenstranger happened before Pope Francis “The False Prophet,” went to Assisi for his Luciferian/Masonic landmark.As the secret occult forces of the Jesuits that control the Catholic Church, the Illuminati, and most branchesof Freemasonry today, we’re moving towards advancing the crafting the One World Religion of the Antichrist, inAssisi, in the middle of the pandemic, something dark and sinister happened in nearby Spoleto, in the province ofPerugia a few days earlier. On Wednesday, September 23rd, 2020 an ampoule,( a small sealed vial, used to containand preserve the blood) of Saint John Paul II, placed in the chapel of the Crucifix of the Cathedral of Spoleto wasstolen with no signs of an infraction. Like I told you a moment ago, in the past few years, similar actions have beenconducted by groups of Satanists in the city of Perugia, and surrounding areas. This happens mainly becauseSatanists often use the stolen relicts, or religious artifacts, for their infamous Black masses, and, in this case, thedisappearance of the blood of Pope John Paul II, on the eve of such an event seems highly suspicious, as Pope JohnPaul II organized the first World Day of Prayer for Peace on October 27, 1986, and this event is still considered tothis day by high-level Freemasons and religious leaders worldwide, as the cornerstone of the One World Religion,with the attendance of 160 religious leaders, who spent that historic day together, fasting and praying to their God orGods, or more likey Lucifer. There is also an interesting dimension of similarities between monastic and Masonicorders and the existence of monastic lodges. Some French and Italian Masonic historians even indicate a more thanspiritually shared parenthood between the Monastic and the Masonic orders. In the XVIIIth century, variousMasonic Lodges were erected in Benedictine monasteries, like Santa Scolastica, for example, in Subiaco.​ Keeping in mind the attitude of the official Roman-Catholic Church towards Freemasonry, this seems ratherinteresting because it shows once again their never-ending hypocrisy. The well-known Ferrer-Benimeli mentions inhis “Archives Secrètes,” that in the last 40 years of the XVIIIth century, an impressive number of Freemasons wereactive in the Catholic Church, either as monks or as priests, and that’s the main reason for having this event inAssisi, not the connection with the pope’s name because well-informed Jesuit sources say that Pope Francis took thename Francis because of Saint Francis Xavier, not Saint Francis of Assisi. Father Xavier was not a monk, but aSpanish Jesuit priest, a missionary, and saint from Navarre who was also the co-founder of the Society of Jesus.Conventual Franciscan Father Mauro Gambetti, the custodian of the Assisi convent, said a few days before thehistorical event that took place on the 3rd of October 2020 that the encyclical of the Pope, “will indicate to the worlda style for the future, and will give the church and people of goodwill the responsibility for building it together.”Adding: “It is with great joy and in prayer that we welcome and wait for the private visit of Pope Francis. A stagethat will highlight the importance and necessity of fraternity.” America the National weekly magazine published bythe Jesuits of the United States, emphatically stated about the event:The words “Fratelli” are from St. Francis of Assisi, just as were the words “Laudato Si’” which the popechose as the title of his second encyclical. It is highly significant that the Argentine pope has decided to sign theencyclical at the tomb of St. Francis. As he has stated on numerous occasions, his ministry as successor of St.Peter has been greatly influenced by the Saint of Assisi and his love for the poor, so much so that on hiselection as pope he took the name Francis, the first pope ever to do so, a name that also conveyed a program.[373]​ The important ceremony was defined by Father Mauro Gambetti as “private” in his description, mainlybecause it took place without the faithful present in respect of the China virus regulations, which in a way facilitatedPope Francis’ heretical work for the establishment of a One World Religion. The title of the encyclical in question,considered of great importance by the Vatican-led New World Order, appears originally in a passage of the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Admonitions of St. Francis, which reads: “Let us all, brothers, look to the Good Shepherd who suffered the passionof the Cross to save his sheep.” But don’t be deceived, the Pope is not the “Good Shepherd.” This quasi-Masonicpapal encyclical is largely connected to the document on “Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together”signed by Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in early 2019. Rumors of a papal encyclical first made therounds in August 2020 when Bishop Domenico Pompili of Rieti let slip during a press conference of the Charter ofIntent signed in light of the 800th anniversary of the nativity scene in Greccio that the document was in the works.[374] Greccio is the cave where Saint Francis of Assisi staged the first-ever nativity scene on Christmas Eve 1223.[375]Given the emphasis Pope Francis has placed on his name misleading the masses, it is unsurprising that hewould have chosen Assisi as the place to sign his important document on the eve of the feast of St. Francis. Becausesince the beginning of his demonic papacy, Francis has exteriorly embraced and celebrated St. Francis of Assisi,knowing he was a model of social justice, which suits him perfectly when it comes to the topics of poverty, peace,and fraternity. However, I’m pretty sure the coming kingdom of God, that will be conducted as a Monarchy withJesus King of all, will never be able to digest all of the leftist proposals of Fratelli Tutti, a quasi-Masonic/Marxistencyclical, that echoes many of the classic themes of Pope Francis’ present work, and I’m 100% sure that SaintFrancis will probably find the Nativity scene that the Vatican placed in 2020 in St. Peter's Square, “grotesque,” and“demonic,\" in that infamous year that started the Great Reset preparing for the One World Religion of the Antichrist.​ In January 2020, just before the China virus frenzy kicked off, another ambiguous figure, Vice President MikePence, visited the Vatican to officially discuss the Abrahamic Faiths Initiative, which is the first concrete steptowards a One World Religion. Mike Pence was so happy about the Pope granting him a private audience that hetold Pope Francis, “You made me a hero” back home.” Now this brief statement on its own should have made a fewpeople worried back then, including President Trump, but nobody seemed to care, or even notice the importance ofthis statement that will be fully understood only one year later when Pence showed his true colors, or simply wentalong with the plan of the elite to replace his former boss with a zombie.After all, the economy at the beginning of 2020 was still striving, and President Trump seemedindestructible and extremely successful in keeping America great. That’s why Pence’s “strange” actions in January2021, when he resisted pressure from President Trump to toss out the fraudulent election results were no surprise tome. Remember that Trump and the Pope’s opposite worldviews collided head-on right at the start of Trump’s bid forthe White House when Francis was sharply critical of Trump’s campaign pledge to build an impenetrable wall onthe Mexican border and his declaration that the United States should turn away Muslim immigrants and refugees tohelp the security of the United States. Eventually, when President Trump went to Rome, photos of the strangeawkward encounter between him, First Lady Melania, and the Pope became viral. The Pope did not look happy at allto be standing next to Trump, with whom he had publicly feuded in the past, and the press immediately went onrecord saying that Pope Francis has smiled during similar photo-ops with other heads of state, from GermanChancellor Angela Merkel to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to former President Obama, but he did notsmile with President Trump, suggesting Francis was way happier to meet a full-on Satanist like Obama. Or maybeTrump and the Pope were also acting a part that was essential for the control of the two opposing factions.​ Going back to the Papal audience with Pence, it is interesting how it happened on the same day that PresidentDonald J. Trump was attending an unprecedented anti-abortion rally in Washington DC, as the first sitting U.S.president to do so in the history of the annual March for Life, and probably the last, if the globalists finishconquering the U.S. in the coming years. At the time of Pence’s visit to the Pope, I wrote on my website “let’s hopePence doesn’t fall into their trap.” Well, it was only wishful thinking on my side, “after all despotic people tend totelegraph their future actions like inexperienced fighters tend to telegraph their punches; it’s not as if the intentionsof totalitarians are obscured or hard to predict.”[376] Says Brandon Smith from alt-market.us. In some cases, the eliteof the New World Order may even believe that they can be as obvious as they wish, because they assume no onewill ever try to stop them, and up until now they sadly seem to have been right in their assertion. The Illuminati eliteof the Vatican-led New World Order has been destroying lives for so long, they end up adopting a sense ofsuperiority as if they are untouchable. Brandon Smith writes:In my extensive study of psychopathy I find that, unfortunately, the primary catalyst for the exploitation andvictimization of large populations of people is that many of them can’t wrap their heads around the idea of anorganized conspiracy of human monsters. They refuse to acknowledge the existence of the evil right in front ofthem, so the evil can go unopposed for long stretches of time. There is ALWAYS a moment, though, whenpsychopaths push the wrong people too far. They just can’t help it, and this is when they find themselves on thebusiness end of a noose or the barrel of a gun."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"When it comes to organizations of psychopaths, the same moment also eventually arrives, it just takeslonger for the public to come to grips with the necessity of it.In terms of the “Great Reset” agenda, medical tyranny using COVID as a rationale is a key ingredient tothe future objectives of the power elite. At the beginning of the pandemic lockdowns last year, I made severalpredictions and warnings. I said that the mandates and lockdowns for most people around the world wouldnever go away, and I called this “Wave Theory”; the use of intermittent moments of limited freedom followedby increasingly more aggressive restrictions.This cycle is meant to condition the public to the idea that governments are “allowed” to micromanage ourdaily lives, that this is “normal”, that it is for our own good, and that we should enjoy the short moments ofliberty or normalcy they so graciously let us have.[377]​ We are living in difficult times if you expose the truth of an authoritarian plot the establishment willimmediately lie and call you a “conspiracy theorist.” Later, once the establishment admits to the plot and you refuseto comply with it, those same liars will not only call you a “conspiracy theorist,” but also a “terrorist.” The OneWorld Religion is a project I have been denouncing for years, hoping some parts of Freemasonry will eventuallyfight it. However, after an investigation I made after moving to the U.S. in 2019, I have found out with the help ofother Freemasons, a lot of evidence that the once glorious institution of U.S. Freemasonry has been infiltrated andcompromised in most of the country by the same dark forces of the left, Islamists, and Satanists who are alsosupporting the One World Religion project of the Jesuits. Now you might disregard the Satanic or religious aspect ofit if you are not a believer, but there is a political one you can’t ignore as a Freemason in good standing.Traditionally, as all Freemasons know, by not permitting the discussion of politics or religion inside Americanlodges you maintain a better atmosphere of harmony and peace that both these subjects can, unfortunately, bring upin other environments, but that’s no longer the case, at least in America.In New Mexico, for example, a 32° Freemason was balloted out from a lodge for simply wearing aProud Boys hat, and in Arizona, a Brother was reprimanded in front of his brothers by his Worshipful Master forwearing a MAGA hat on his way to the lodge. The basic principle in Freemasonry is to be respectful and fair toeveryone regardless of their ideology and beliefs. This is fundamental to why Freemasonry was founded and why itis still in existence today. Masonic brethren should respect each other, and this includes leaving your political orreligious stand outside the lodge. Instead, for the first time since the Civil War, Freemasonry in the U.S. is onceagain divided by politics and religion, with entire lodges dedicated to a specific political inclination, that in mostcases seems to be Socialism! In most cases, bringing Freemasonry into disrepute by not respecting the basic rules ofthe Craft that forbid such discrimination.​ In the Masonic Grand Lodge’s of Democratic states like California or Colorado, Islamic groups like theMuslim Brotherhood and even Harun Yahya’s Turkish sect, are preaching and involved in running local lodges.Timothy Hogan, who is held in high esteem in U.S. Masonic circles, and is also the Grand Master of the Neo-Templar Order called Ordre Souverain du Temple Initiatique (OSTI), that runs the Cercle International deRecherches Culturelles et Spirituelles (CIRCES), even went to Turkey to meet face to face with the controversialIslamic scholar Adnan Oktar aka Harun Yahya, who claims he is the Mahdi of the Islamic prophecies. TimothyHogan, who is a Democrat and a member of the Grand Lodge of A.F. & A.M. of Colorado, a Past Master of EastDenver #160 Masonic Lodge (AF&AM), and an active member of Enlightenment Lodge #198, two lodges that wereused to actively promote his new Islamic alliance in recent years.​ On top of all this, we have the infiltration of para-Masonic Illuminati sects like the O.T.O, that continues thepromotion of anti-Christian beliefs of irregular Freemason’s like Aleister Crowley, undisturbed. In California whereI live, the O.T.O. has taken over most lodges, especially in the Los Angeles County area, including some prestigiousones in Hollywood and South Pasadena. In New York City, the Masonic Hall that is home to the headquarters of theGrand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York regularly rents their lodge meeting roomslocated on the corner of 23rd St and 6th Avenue, and the other (constructed in 1907) facing 24th St, to the O.T.O.for their infamous Gnostic Masses featuring a Priestess who sits naked upon the Masonic Altar used by regularFreemasons during their regular meetings. Remember, most Freemasons, are good people who often ignore the facttheir lodge rooms have been used for such depravities by other Fraternal organizations thanks to their connectionswith high-level members of the Craft. But let’s remember, the visible world is but a reflection of theinvisible realm, and at its center stands the altar used in ancient times for sacrifices, obligation, and adoration andnow a focus of faith and fellowship amongst the Brothers of the Craft during their rituals. Of course, while we hold aview of the world very unlike that which was held by our ancient brethren, let’s remember that the Masonic Lodge isa symbol of the world as it was thought to be in ancient times. The ancient brethren that created the institution ofFreemasonry using the art of analogy, had profound insight when they saw the world as a temple over-hung by a"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"starry canopy by night, lit by the journeying sun by day, wherein man goes forth to his labor on a checker-board oflights and shadows, joys, and sorrows, seeking to reproduce on earth the law and order of heaven. So what happensnow that Freemasonry has been taken over by Satanists, Muslims, and left-wingers whose intent is to destroyChristianity and the American way of life? This goes against the very principles of Freemasonry as envisioned byBrothers like George Washington, the founding father of our nation who served as the first President of the UnitedStates.Since I have arrived in the U.S. I met many great Brothers who I have recognized as legitimate andhonest in their Masonic undertakings, but most of them are now disappointed with an organization that in manystates like California is requiring proof of vaccination to participate in lodge workings, and during the first year ofthe pandemic was meeting only on Zoom for the joy of Communist China. Zoom has acknowledged keeping at leastone data center and a staff employee in China, where the Communist government requires resident tech firms toprovide user data on request and Jacob Helberg, a senior adviser at the Stanford University Center on Geopoliticsand Technology said in October 2021, that “If you have Zoom engineers in China who have access to the actualservers, from an engineering standpoint those engineers can have access to the content of potential communicationsin China.”[378]On top of this, U.S. Freemasons were not even capable of stopping the removal and destruction of the statue oftheir legendary Sovereign Grand Commander of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Albert Pike. The statuewas toppled and burned by protesters in June 2020, as protests continued in response to the murder of GeorgeFloyd[379]and James D. Cole, 33°, their present Sovereign Grand Commander, made the following statement,showing to all of us how the Jesuit progressive leftist ideals are guiding the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite inthe United States: On June 19th, 2020 a statue of Past Grand Commander Albert Pike was toppled from its pedestal inWashington, D.C.The statue celebrated Pike’s humanitarian successes and his leadership of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.The statue was gifted to the people of the United States in 1901. Even though the Scottish Rite no longer hadany ownership rights to the sculpture, this Supreme Council has repeatedly voiced its strong support for anygovernmental decision to remove the statue, because we recognized that its existence could be a concernamong some citizens.We can never condone unlawful acts; otherwise, the foundation of our society would crumble. However, thestatue has belonged to the people since we gave it to them more than a hundred years ago. Our prayer is thatthe removal of the statue can be at least a small step toward healing our nation’s wounds.As Scottish Rite Masons, we prefer to step forward with our fellow citizens, consistent with the Scottish RiteCreed: Human progress is our cause, liberty of thought our supreme wish, freedom of conscience our mission,and the guarantee of equal rights to all people everywhere our ultimate goal.[380]​ Of course, the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the American “York” Rite, and so forth, were invented byMasons, and require members to be Master Masons, but like Bro. Andrew Hammer explains in his book Observingthe Craft: The Pursuit of Excellence in Masonic Labour and Observance (Mindhive Books, 2010), they are not inthemselves Masonry because only the degrees and work of the Craft Lodge, the Symbolic Lodge can be calledFreemasonry. However, Bro. Andrew Hammer is not only an author by another Marxist using the Craft to promotehis Socialist ideal. Hammer, a friend of Bernie Sanders, with a controversial past in Virginia's Alexandria-Washington Lodge 22,[381]has been traveling for years around the world meeting socialist leaders, like SocialistInternational Secretary-General Louis Ayala, former Nicaraguan President Danil Ortega, and many others. He evendelivered a speech in Vienna to the Austrian Socialist, andhe is also a big supporter of leftist Freemason Pope Francis’ work for the creation of a “One World Religion.”So, we can say that all the most prominent contemporary Freemasons are united in pushing the progressive agendaof the Vatican.

First, we need to observe what the enemy does. The elite is organizedin secret networks connected to clubs and lodges present all over the planet, in which the slaves of the worldwidetechnocracy are constantly kept under control. They have been organized for centuries, and they obey ruthlessmasters blindly, who offer them in exchange, privileges, and power. While you are wasting your time, watching TV,or surfing the internet, they act in the shadows in secret. In the meantime, you keep on fooling yourself anddreaming of a better world, occupying your time on a variety of senseless conspiracy theories like the Earth is flat,or did man really go to the moon. Who cares, when we are about to face the possible extermination of large parts ofhumanity, including yourself and your family and friends. Remember, without creating a real organized structure todefeat this evil, there is no chance for us to stop it, or even survive it in the long run. You can see that the politicalsystem you are trying to fight, is founded on a strong technocratic military organizational structure, in whichjournalists, bankers, and Hollywood stars are all sleeping together, and nothing is left to chance. The truth is thatthey are well-organized, and we are not, that’s why we need to have a more structured organization for the GreatReject.​ Today most of us are isolated, but at the same time we are willingly offering our soul, and all our personalinformation to the internet and to Artificial Intelligence/Cyber Satan that controls it, increasingly indulging in thedangers of virtual reality, aka the metaverse. In the meantime, the elite of the New World Order, the Freemasons,and their Illuminati and Jesuit controllers, are enjoying the real world, they meet in person, free of restrictions evenin the middle of the China virus pandemic. They collaborate and help each other following the Biblical phrase, “thoushalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” The elite that appears in front of the tv cameras, enjoys fooling people thatapplaud them from their modest homes while they enjoy the finest things in life. Things that most of us can’t afforddue to the infinite restrictions that the elite is imposing on us in the last few years. Just ask yourself if you feel freerthan you used to, and you will immediately find the answer and realize your present level of slavery. When are wefinally going to realize that we need a true strategy to move forward and oppose all this, as publically The NewWorld Order is been ushered in thanks to the pandemic? “COVID and The New World Order - Building A NewHuman Centered Economy” is the title of an article that appeared on Forbes in September 2020, by LawrenceWintermeyer, who writes without any sense of shame:The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes to our lives and the economy. The enforcedswitch to virtual work, changes to our travel and consumption patterns, and bans on social gatherings havegenerated a seismic shift towards virtual activity. Anything that can be done virtually is now done virtually. Thelockdown has us thinking about what the future will bring.[382]​ As we embark on the Chinese Year of the Tiger many things are already clear, the attempt to destroy culture,customs, habits, and ideas is an ideological doctrine called the “four olds.” It is covert Maoism. For my friend andauthor, Ryan Gable, in the introduction to a recent radio show we did together, these “olds” can be expanded to “theintroduction of homosexual pornography in the classrooms across the United States, the chanting of cannibalisticgods in Californian classrooms, the sacrificing of children on the altar of social justice and political correctionthrough experimental medical trials, etc. All these weapons, target the youth, corrupt their moral centers, andprepare their minds for a download of ideological prejudice and the acceptance of censorship and violence in thename of supposed equality. Compounding this is the notion that one is an oppressor or pressed simply because oftheir skin color or ethnicity - a discriminatory ideology based on genetic guilt.”​ Though it may seem as if American society has collectively reached this cultural tipping point overnight, therecent attacks on individual freedom and civic institutions are the effects of a decades-old worldview known asCritical Race Theory, a divisive discourse that puts people of color against white people, that originated in Europealmost a hundred years ago. German academics who wanted to find an authentic form of Marxism after World War Iformed the “Frankfurt School” at the University of Frankfurt. There, they developed what was called “CriticalTheory.” The Nazis chased them out of Europe in the 1930s, and the Frankfurt School’s members, including Max"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, moved to Columbia University at the beginning of World War II. The earlytheorists combined the Marxist perspective that the world is divided only between the oppressors and the oppressedand the postmodern idea that there is no “authentic truth,” only perspectives (called “narratives”).Once in the U.S., still more students and academics applied the Critical Theorists’ teachingsand writings to American law. This Critical Legal Theory was already skeptical of the traditional liberal order—ideas like a representative democracy and equality under the law—and theorists embraced the notion that anyoneidentifying with a victimized category should dismantle systems of authority. Theorist Derrick Bell, later consideredthe godfather of Critical Race Theory, said he hoped the “program of scholarly resistance will lay the groundworkfor wide-scale resistance.”[383] Unfortunately, it laid in the ground for rioters toppling statues of our FoundingFathers, activists rewriting school textbooks, mobs eroding freedom of speech, and the virtues of hard work andcommitment we used to hold dear being eviscerated in the name of cultural Marxism, that is, of course, part of theGreat Reset package, and to obtain all this, so-called “woke” crusaders have redefined the vital concept of justice inAmerica.​ For Gable, “the undermining of culture seeks to sever the connection between the individual and the largercommunity. Virtually every non-legislative recommendation from federal agencies, local government, and stategovernments has done just that in the name of public health over the last two years. This constant undermining hasresulted in further moral degeneration and cultural decline on an unprecedented level. Every public ‘health’ policyhas separated families, isolated children, inhibited learning, destroyed small and medium business entrepreneurs,and worked to destroy infrastructure in the name of building back better.”​ This is for Gable, the product of “Maoist and Marxist ideology, or the great leap forward - better known asthe Great Leap Forward Reset.” Adding that, “the usage of an invisible enemy like a virus, and the usage ofenvironmentalism, are tenets of the same school of Maoist and Marxist ideology. The Communists did this in 1952China, lying to the public about the spreading of biological weapons and viral contagions. Meanwhile, within whatwe call the field of ufology, some groups are using lasers and other methods to contact what they believe to be alienspaceships or UFOs. One can’t help but think that these little green men, or little gray men, are similar to thehomunculus of alchemists and magicians like John D and Edward Kelley. The same can be said about AleisterCrowley‘s alien friend. These seemingly harmless games with lasers and UFOs are akin to a modern form ofcollective community ritualism to invoke that which is non-specified or descriptive. The intention is simply toinvoke for the sake of invocation, or perhaps to obtain contact to satisfy one’s desire to believe or to have specialknowledge. All of this has been utilized to undermine public faith in faith, religious institutions, etc. It’s hard toseparate true faith for some folks from that which is propped up by the rot within official institutions that claim tospeak for God and man. This undermining of faith mixed with the open acknowledgment of child sex trafficking,child abuse, etc. destroys one of the three major centers of power in the world, the perceptual power that resides atthe Vatican. This center of religious power adorned with an obelisk is one of three horns spoken of in the book ofDaniel. The other two horns can be found in London, the city of financial power, and the United States, WashingtonDC, the seat of political and military might.”​ Something strange is going on at CNN concerning their Jesuit controllers and pedophilia that now connectswith evidence- Chris Cuomo, brother of another Jesuit agent and former governor, the Pope, and John Griffin, asenior producer from CNN who worked with the now-disgraced ex-anchor Chris Cuomo. John Griffin was arrestedby the FBI in early December 2021, and charged with enticing minors as young as 9-years-old to engage in unlawfulsexual activity. Between April and July of 2020, Griffin – who worked on the CNN show New Day, that wasconducted by Cuomo, allegedly used online messaging applications to communicate with the purported parents ofminor daughters, according to a Vermont grand jury indictment, instructing them on how to prepare their children tohave sex with him. But there is something even more deranged about this story. John Griffin, who worked “shoulderto shoulder” with Chris Cuomo, appeared once in the arms of Cuomo in a very weird photo originally posted onTwitter on the 26th of September 2015, where he is holding a replica doll of pedo-ringleader Pope Francis. The picin question, and the heretical description confirms beyond any doubt CNN as a papal pedo base:@ChrisCuomo says he can get me blessed by #PopeFrancis thanks to my “giant baby head.” Let’s try it, shallwe??​ The 44-year-old CNN producer John Griffin from Stamford CT used Google Hangouts and Kik to convincethe mothers that a “woman is a woman regardless of her age,” and that “women should be sexually subservient andinferior to men.” The indictment also includes specific allegations that Griffin attempted to entice two other childrenover the internet to engage in sexual activity.

In June of 2020, Griffin proposed to a purported mother of a 16-year-old daughter that she take a “little mother-daughter trip” to Griffin’s Ludlow ski house for sexual traininginvolving the child.” As you can see, the perverted minds at work behind the scenes at CNN seem to have a verydifferent approach to the so-called “Holy Father,” and only a week after the arrest of John Griffin, the exceptionalinvestigative journalist at Project Veritas released the name of another CNN producer caught up in a pedophiliascandal, Rick Saleeby, a producer on one of the network’s most successful shows “The Lead with Jake Tapper.”[384]​ Then we have the Elizabeth II, the old British monarch, dying before our eyes and the corruption, accusationsof pedophilia, racism, and vitriol within her Royal family, and its subsequent public fracturing, mixed with globalfinancial and economic distress, that has been a monumental undermining of the public perception of that secondmajor center of power pointed out by Gable, who rightly says: “The idea that an invisible enemy wreckedeconomies, drove small businesses, owners and employees out of jobs, destroyed people's savings, obliteratedmanufacturing, supply chains, resource distribution, etc. is accurate only so much as the invisible enemy is classifiedin a group such as the World Economic Forum instead of a virus.With the religious and financial horns undermined, we turn our attention to the political andmilitary power of the United States in Washington DC. Supposedly at the helm is a dying so-called leader withblatant dementia. His criminal behavior, as with his son’s, and their connections to Communist China considered,the President of the United States represents the flexing of a political and military muscle that has dissolved intoparalysis. Parallel to this overturning of the world systems of governance is the reported assassin who threatened tokill the President of the United States. He was arrested on December 30, 2021 and the media claimed he wanted tokill those involved in the sex trafficking of children, something mainstream media sources denied was anythingmore than a Qanon conspiracy theory, literally less than 24 hours after the sentencing of Ghislaine Maxwell, whowas convicted of child sex trafficking and her involvement in an international ring that included some of the mostpowerful and wealthy people in the world. A few days before, a man broke into Windsor Castle on Christmas with acrossbow to Assassinate the queen. And just a few days before that, a press release about an event that happened inNovember documented how a rogue drone was stopped from targeting the pope. Once again, three horns beingplucked.”​ The elite is deranged and perverted, that’s obvious, and a growing number of people are finally realizing this,that’s why they need to implement the Great Reset as soon as possible, to silence all of us once and for all, that’s themain reason for this sudden oppressive change. However, the populist masses are rising in Europe, the UnitedStates, and even in South America, while in Asia compliance, unfortunately, is the norm, and in Africa corruptionrules all parts of society. They call us the losers who don’t want to accept globalization and technologicaladvancement, who have turned to populism and populist political parties in despair, but that’s not always the case.Most of us are simply feeling that something is truly wrong with what is unfolding in our new reality, and politicsand corrupt politicians are not going to be able to save us from this. We need to be honest with ourselves about it.​ As Ryan Gable cleverly explains: “In the book of Daniel, we are told that the three horns will be replaced bya little horn known as the Antichrist who will be given power by the beast. The perceptual powers that exist at theVatican, London, and Washington, maybe those three horns, and a little horn to be given power by the beast may bythat which controls the Great Reset, otherwise translated as King Set. If Prince William took the throne, he can takeupon himself the name of Arthur. The once and future King could be granted power by his father abdicating thethrone, Prince Charles, of course, being the red dragon or beast. Some may say China is the red dragon. It’sinteresting because Arthur is associated with and derived from Ursa Major, the bear. It is from this constellation thatthe tiger is born. In mythology, the tiger lives 1000 years. Likewise, it is from Ursa Major from where astrologersderive the swastika. Although we are dealing with a state of hybrid Fascist Communism, wherein the hammer andsickle should be remembered much like the swastika, it is interesting that the swastika is derived astrologically fromthe same constellation that births the tiger who lives the length of the great thousand-year Reich. Ursa Major wasalso called the Dog of Set/Typhon by the Egyptians. Again, King Set, the Antichrist. It is such in mythology that hewho the tiger devours becomes a servant of the tiger and can only escape the jaws of suffering if he sacrificesinnocent souls in his place. From artificial intelligence to idealistic and ideological rabid progressive politics, thoseconsumed by the beast-like devil who made a deal with diabolic forces, look to keep themselves alive artificially bysacrificing the innocent - never being able to admit that they have been consumed and therefore seeking redemption.2022, the year of the tiger, could also be the year in which the tiger, or the beast, gives rise to that whichpromulgates the thousand-year Reich, and that is the Great Reset or the establishment of the Kingdom of theAntichrist.”This kingdom, is, of course, The Fourth Reich ushered in by Klaus and friends, which will bethe exact opposite of the Kingdom of God that we want to establish after the Great Reject. After all, it was Illuminatiagent Baron Julius Evola (1898-1974), who was admired by the SS head Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, whom"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"he once met, and a popular figure in fringe circles, described as one of “the leading philosophers of Europe's neo-fascist movement[385],” that I have mentioned in Vol.1, and discussed in great length in Volume 2 of myConfessions, who talks in his final major work, about riding the tiger, offering us a brilliant description of our “DarkAge”:The phrase was chosen as the title of this book, “ride the tiger,” may serve as a transition between what hasbeen said hitherto, and this other order of ideas. The phrase is a Far Eastern saying, expressing the idea that ifone succeeds in riding a tiger, not only does one avoid having it leap on one, but if one can keep one’s seat andnot fall off, one may eventually get the better of it. Those who are interested may be reminded of a similartheme found in the schools of traditional wisdom, such as the “ox-herding” episodes of Japanese Zen; while inclassical antiquity, there is a parallel in the trials of Mithras, who lets himself be dragged by the bull and willnot let go until the animal stops, whereupon Mithras kills it. This symbolism is applicable at various levels.First, it can refer to a line of conduct in the interior, personal life; then to the appropriate attitude in the face ofcritical, historical, and collective situations. In the latter case, we are interested in the relation of the symbol tothe doctrine of cycles, with regard to both the general structure of history and the particular aspect of it thatrefers to the sequence of the “Four Ages.” This is a teaching that, as I have shown elsewhere,1 bears identicaltraits in the East and in the ancient West. (Giambattista Vico simply caught an echo of it.)In the classical world, it was presented in terms of humanity’s progressive descent from the Golden Age towhat Hesiod called the Iron Age. In the corresponding Hindu teaching, the final age is called the Kali Yuga(Dark Age). Its essential quality is emphatically said to be a climate of dissolution, in which all the forces—individual and collective, material, psychic, and spiritual—that were previously held in check by a higher lawand by influences of a superior order pass into a state of freedom and chaos. The texts of Tantra have a strikingimage for this situation, saying that it is the time when Kali is “wide awake.” Kali is a female divinitysymbolizing the elementary, primordial forces of the world and of life, but in her “lower” aspects she is alsopresented as a goddess of sex and orgiastic rites. In previous ages, she was “sleeping,” that is, latent in thelatter aspects, but in the Dark Age she is said to be completely awake and active.[386]​ In the book, Ride the Tiger, A Survival Manual for the Aristocrats of the Soul (1961), Evola presents animplacable criticism of the idols, structures, theories, and illusions of our dissolute age examined in the light of theinner teachings of indestructible Tradition. Evola identifies the type of human capable of “riding the tiger,” who maytransform destructive processes into inner liberation. He offers hope for those who wish to reembraceTraditionalism.[387] But while I can’t agree with Evola’s pagan view that allegedly led him to become a member ofCrowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis, I do agree with the fact that this book is an excellent criticism of the decline of our“Modern World.” A world where Pope Francis’ vestments designer and papal tailor, Filippo Sorcinelli, is aflamboyant homosexual activist who is flaunting his papal credentials to market a brand of homoerotic perfumes formen which carry the label “parental advisory: explicit perfume,” that are described as “a journey through spiritualityand harmony in the constant and daring search for beauty.”​ Advertisements for the controversial products make use of sacrilegious, Satanic, and sexual imagery.Sorcinelli’s wide range of 27 perfumes is produced by a Milan-based company that translates his experiences intofragrances. “I have explored the world of identity and sexuality in this pandemic year,” the entrepreneur boasts. Thefour perfumes in the “perversion extract” range are named “Popper Pop,” “Cruising Area,” “Slightly Bitch,” and, ofcourse, “Cyber Sex,” which will bring you right into the arms of Cyber Satan in a not soo distant future. I wonderwhat Evola would have said about it, even if I must admit I never understood his link with weirdo creepo AleisterCrowley, and the Italian philosopher is an unlikely hero for defenders of the “Judeo-Christian West,” like myself, soplease study him with care. References to Evola abound in recent years on websites such as Breitbart News, TheDaily Stormer, and AltRight.com well before The New York Times noted in 2017 the Bannon-Evola connection. Butall these people including Trump’s former adviser, have little or no knowledge of who Evola really was. After all,Evola believed in the power of magick (with a K like Crowley) and tried to use it to restore Roman pagan religion,something that I find completely Satanic and anti-Christian.Of course, some aspects of his criticism of the “Modern World,” are correct, just as the work of hiscontemporary René Guénon (1886-1951), the French metaphysician, writer, and editor, who, after publishing TheCrisis of the Modern World, where he discussed modernity, and how it has flipped everything around putting manbefore God, the material before the metaphysical, pleasure before duty, unfortunately, rejected the Western worldand Christianity to embrace Islam."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"FIG. 41 –– Julius Evola (1898-1974) philosopher and \"chief ideologue\" of Italy's radical right after World War II who allegedly worked for theSicherheitsdienst, or SD, the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party.The Future of the Davos Agenda They are well-organized and ready to take over the world, but some members of the global business elite musthave been disappointed to learn that the World Economic Forum in Davos, as an in-person event, was canceled onceagain, in 2022, for the second year running, officially due to concerns tied to the global COVID pandemic, and notbecause of all the emissions created by the private air force of all their elite attendees, that usually travel for a pricetag of around 50 thousand USD, to the remote Alpine skiing village for the annual event. Officially, the WorldEconomic Forum or WEF, like some prefer to call it, was forced to rethink its plans for their lavish in-person event,and hosted the whole thing virtually, instead, officially due to “continued uncertainty” over the latest variant of thisinfinite pandemic. They said in their official communication that the: “Current pandemic conditions make itextremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting,” adding that, “Despite the meeting’s stringent healthprotocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary.” ​ At this point, many of you will probably wonder why the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab andthe Davos elite, made up of extremely influential people that can bend the rules all the time, are even bothering withsuch restrictions? And the answer is a very simple, and shocking one, at the same time: Their mission has beenaccomplished and they are proceeding towards a future Metaverse solution. So, at this point, they don’t really careabout the formalities, fancy dinners, or their yearly meeting any longer, as they prefer to meet online, or in secret to"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"avoid public scrutiny.For this reason, the global thought leaders, political leaders, and business leaders have, at least for the moment,gathered in a scaled-back all-online version of the speeches, with virtual talks and forums that make up the bulk ofthe event, which is better known for its influential parties and backroom dealings, that for some people are worth 50thousand dollars.However, in late January 2022, the World Economic Forum announced they might attempt aphysical event if all the safety precautions can be taken. Right now, the tentative dates are May 22-26, according to astatement emailed to members that were obtained by Bloomberg.[388]Last year the event was also canceled becauseof the pandemic, then tentatively rescheduled to take place in Singapore over the summer, before ultimately beingcanceled again because of the global pandemic. However, the last in-person event of the WEF, that took place inDavos netted the Swiss economy around CHF80 million ($87 million) in 2020, with businesses and hotels taking insome CHF63 million in revenues, so the locals are eager to get things going again.[389] But things are changing nowbecause in a certain sense “Davos is dead,” like POLITICO suggested in an article by Ryan Health, published onthe 20th of December 2021 says:The postponement — due to Omicron’s emergence — is the latest in a series of failed efforts by WEF toreturn to in-person meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, and puts financial pressure on the organization,with tens of millions of dollars of event income at risk.In 2020, WEF’s Davos conference attracted more than 100 billionaires and 53 heads of state orgovernment. Companies — still mostly from the U.S. and Europe — pay around $50,000 per person for acoveted “white badge” to access this guest list.[390]​ In June 2021, Schwab had also sharply criticized the “profiteering”, “complacency” and “lack ofcommitment” by the municipality of Davos concerning the WEF annual meeting. Well-informed sources say he didthis because he does not need them anymore. For this reason, he mentioned that the preparation of their recentevents in other possible locations like Singapore had created an alternative to its Swiss host, saying the chance thatthe annual meeting will stay in Davos was between 40 and 70 percent.[391] ​ This is the full statement issued on the 20th of December 2021 by Adrian Monck, Managing Director, PublicEngagement, of Schwab’s WEF given from his headquarters in Geneva (Switzerland):The World Economic Forum will defer its Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in the light of continueduncertainty over the Omicron outbreak.The Annual Meeting was scheduled to take place in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland between 17-21 January2022. It is now planned for early summer.Participants will instead join a headlining series of State of the World sessions bringing together globalleaders online to focus on shaping solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges.Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Preparationshave been guided by expert advice and have benefited from the close collaboration of the Swiss government atall levels.Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on traveland mobility have made deferral necessary.The health and safety of everyone involved in physical meetings – participants, collaborators, and the hostcommunity – have always been the Forum’s priority.\"The deferral of the Annual Meeting will not prevent progress through the continued digital convening ofleaders from business, government, and civil society,\" said Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and ExecutiveChairman of the World Economic Forum. “Public-private cooperation has moved forward throughout thepandemic and that will continue apace. We look forward to bringing global leaders together in person soon.”​Marcello Bussi, an economic journalist for the newspaper Milano Finanza, who has been following the event foryears, seems to also think that the mission of the World Economic Forum has been accomplished in Davos andcould move elsewhere. After all, they officially announced, “The Great Reset Initiative” in this CONTEXT:The COVID-19 crisis, the political, economic, and social disruptions it has caused, are fundamentallychanging the traditional context for decision-making. The inconsistencies, inadequacies, and contradictions ofmultiple systems –from health and finance, to energy and education – are more exposed than ever amidst aglobal context of concern for lives, livelihoods, and the planet. Leaders find themselves at a historic"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"crossroads, managing short-term pressures against medium- and long-term uncertainties.[392]​ Adding, this was an “OPPORTUNITY”:As we enter a unique window of opportunity to shape the recovery, this initiative will offer insights to helpinform all those determining the future state of global relations, the direction of national economies, thepriorities of societies, the nature of business models, and the management of a global commons. Drawing fromthe vision and vast expertise of the leaders engaged across the Forum’s communities, the Great Reset initiativehas a set of dimensions to build a new social contract that honors the dignity of every human being.[393]​ These Jesuit agents are echoing what Pope Francis said in 2020 when Bergoglio called the pandemic “anopportunity.” Yes, I will add, an opportunity to transform America, and the rest of the world, into a Communisthellhole, that’s for sure. Remember, it was Freemason and Illuminati, Sir Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister,and statesman (1874-1965), who was also a member of the Ancient Order of Druids[394], and a disciple of H. G.Wells, that first said: “Never let a good crisis go to waste.”     Because of some critics, Klaus Schwab WEF is exercising too much influence on global systems andinstitutions. In the meantime, people like George Soros have used their Davos session to completely redesign theinternational monetary system, and soon we might end up with a cashless society, and a Chinese-style social creditsystem because of the Davos crew, with a combination of government and business surveillance, that will give allthe future citizens of the New World Order, a “score” only if you obey and comply with their system.Under the Biden administration, the United States is on the path toward becoming a welfarestate fully entrenched in waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Like James Comer, a Ranking Member of theHouse Oversight and Reform Committee wrote in a recent article:President Biden plans to expand welfare to almost half of the country’s working adults through thedeceptively named American Families Plan. If passed, it will allow the federal government to meddle inAmericans’ everyday lives from birth to death. Meanwhile, every year, entitlement programs are spending tensof billions of taxpayer dollars improperly—either through inaccuracies, incompetence, or fraud.[395] ​ Of course, like Comer also said in the same article “Republicans stand ready to stop the rise of the socialiststate, and while we wage that battle,”[396] but will that be enough to stop the plan of the New World Order? And willthe Republicans manage to stop the increase in censorship from the Silicon Valley mafia? Probably not, and by2024-2025 we might be completely screwed up in one way or the other, so please prepare, as I suggested earlierbecause the future is very much uncertain.Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown champions have perennially invoked“science and data” to sanctify any mandate politicians impose, as this is a materialistic, senseless, Satanic approach,typical of this age. Hard facts have shown that neither vaccines or face masks provide enough sure-fire protectionagainst the China virus, and this whole biological warfare, waged against the West, to crack its Capitalistic systemand implement the Great Reset. That’s why Chinese President Xi Jinping, was, the special guest of honor thatopened the Sinocentric WEF Davos Agenda virtual sessions of 2022, with a good dose of Communist-Jesuitrhetoric/propaganda, playing the part of the good guy by saying: “We need to discard Cold War mentality and seekpeaceful co-existence and win-win outcomes.” Adding after crippling the worldwide economy: “Our world today isfar from being tranquil. Rhetorics that stoke hatred and prejudice abound. Acts of containment, suppression, orconfrontation arising thereof do all harm, not the least good to world peace and security.”[397]​ Well, why doesn’t President Xi Jinping respect the democratic rights of the people of Hong Kong, or tell usmore about the Uyghur genocide, or of course, finally reveal to us the origins of the virus that came out of hisWuhan lab, before pushing his own rhetorics and respectability on us?​ That’s why Schwab’s buddy and partial mentor Henry Kissinger wrote:From its unification as a single political entity in 221 B.C. through the early twentieth century, China’sposition at the center of the world order was so ingrained in its elite thinking that in the Chinese languagethere was no word for it. Only retrospectively did scholars define the “Sinocentric” tribute system.[398]​ Some Christians believe the “kings from the east” in Revelation 16:12–16 to be a direct reference to China.Many also think “the land of Syene” that we find in Isaiah 49:12 is associated with China. The passage says, “Thesixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"kings from the east. And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out ofthe mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, whogo abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.('Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not goabout naked and be seen exposed!') And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.”The gathering of armies is in preparation for the battle of the inevitable Armageddon, which takes place at the end ofthe Tribulation. Some interpret “the kings of the east” marching toward the Middle East, as the armies of China,being able to cross the dried up Euphrates, and aside from the fact that in 2021 millions of people in Iraq and Syriaare facing water shortage as the region’s longest river dries up[399], China has significantly increased its economic,political, and – to a lesser extent – security footprint in the Middle East in the past twelve years, becoming thebiggest trade partner and external investor for many countries in the region.[400]The kings of the east will join the forces of the Antichrist, and at that point, the final, seventhbowl judgment will be poured out, as our Lord Jesus Christ will finally return, and the world will be shaken.Remember, that Jesus will return so quickly, any attempt to live by the world's rules will be futile as his Kingdomwill rise and become the only sovereignty accepted by God on this planet. Ultimately, the armies of the East and thearmies of the Antichrist will be destroyed by the Messiah and his allies (Revelation 16:17–20; 19:11–21). Thiscoalition of eastern kings indicates China, which has one of the most powerful and numerous armies in history, andits military, economic power, and influence are growing more and more every day. Add to that its constantpersecution of Christians, and other religions, and it seems China is at the center of all end-times activities.​ Therefore, China works very closely with both Illuminati Kingpin Henry Kissinger and Klaus Schwab, whoseson Olivier Schwab, is even married to a Chinese woman and heads the WEF office in Beijing, to bring us rightinto the hands of Cyber Satan, as merging man with machine is one of the most important aspects of “The GreatReset,” or the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” “What the fourth industrial revolution will lead to is a fusion of ourphysical, digital, and biological identity,” Schwab told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in May 2019.[401]Schwab went on to explain in the same event how his book, Shaping the Future of The Fourth Industrial Revolution,was particularly popular in China, but also South Korea, and Japan, with the South Korean military alone purchasing16,000 copies. An astonishing number sold in a country that is paradoxically trying to oppose the North KoreanCommunist model. In the book in question, Schwab explains with excitement how upcoming technology will allowauthorities to “intrude into the hitherto private space of our minds, reading our thoughts and influencing ourbehavior.” He goes on to predict that this will provide an incentive for law enforcement to implement MinorityReport-style pre-crime programs.“As capabilities in this area improve, the temptation for law enforcement agenciesand courts to use techniques to determine the likelihood of criminal activity, assess guilt, or even possibly retrievememories directly from people’s brains will increase,” writes Schwab. “Even crossing a national border might oneday involve a detailed brain scan to assess an individual’s security risk.”​ Schwab also waxes lyrical about the transhumanist utopian dream shared by all elitists which will ultimatelylead to the creation of human cyborgs.“Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies will not stop at becoming part ofthe physical world around us—they will become part of us,” writes Schwab. “Indeed, some of us already feel thatour smartphones have become an extension of ourselves. Today’s external devices—from wearable computers tovirtual reality headsets—will almost certainly become implantable in our bodies and brains.” Schwab also openlyendorses something the media still claims is solely a domain of discussion for conspiracy theorists, namely “activeimplantable microchips that break the skin barrier of our bodies.”The globalists hail the arrival of “implanted devices (that) will likely also help tocommunicate thoughts normally expressed verbally through a ‘built-in’ smartphone, and potentially unexpressedthoughts or moods by reading brain waves and other signals.”So in other words, the “fusion of our physical, digital and biological identity” like investigative journalist PaulJoseph Watson points out, “relates to the transhumanist singularity, and a future where people have their everymovement tracked and every thought read by an implantable microchip.” Basically, “It isn’t a conspiracy theory.”Says, Paul, “when they’re openly telling you what they want to do.”[402]​ In this context, a promo produced last year by Schwab’s globalist World Economic Forum (WEF), describesthe post-industrial changes they have planned for humanity, including biometric surveillance and digitalization ofwork and education. The WEF website asks, “What are the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic? These 5trends give us a glimpse.”The most alarming “trend” is the introduction of biometric surveillance using anindividual’s heartbeat as their ID signature. “Digital acceleration has also put the limelight back onto security issues.Much of the world’s move online – whether for work or your weekly shop – involves sharing personal or businessinformation remotely, with an ever-wider number of entities. When people started wearing masks, facial recognitionsecurity systems were stumped,” the WEF states. “One solution to this conundrum may be the unique pattern of"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"your heartbeat. Developed by the Pentagon and NASA, ‘cardio ID’ devices can detect an individual’s unique cardiacsignature using an infrared laser. The technology is already available for licensing, and security is only one possibleuse. Another application could be identifying opted-in shoppers as they enter a store, for example, to personalizetheir visit.”​ The other three “trends” describe a general shift away from a socializing in-person work and schoolenvironment: repurposing office space to create “neighborhood hubs,” cultivating a personalized “cloud market”home delivery system, and leaning more heavily on digital Zoom schooling for students, after all, the CEO andfounder of Zoom Video Communications, is a Chinese-American billionaire who used to live in Beijing beforemoving to Silicon Valley in the 1990s but has always kept strong ties with China's ruling Communist Party, and inDecember 2020 Federal prosecutors accused a Zoom executive of working with the Chinese government to surveyusers and suppress video calls.[403]The social engineers of the Davos elite are eager to impose their Sinocentric technocraticvision of the world on humanity. Professor Klaus Schwab explained how the COVID-19 pandemic presents the elitewith a unique opportunity to usher in the final stages of this New World Order system,[404] which seems to alwaysput science before God and even before man, and the people seem to buy this new version of reality. No amount ofevidence has ever shaken the faith that most people have today in the absolute power of their only “God” calledscience, and COVID policies are increasingly degenerating to the equivalent of sacrificing virgins to appease angryviral gods, and far greater restrictions may always be on the horizon in this constant move towards embracing theideals of Communist China, and their Illuminati/Jesuit controllers. Politicians’ anti-COVID recommendationsincreasingly resemble frightened soldiers shooting at any noise they hear in the dark. The Big pharma industry hasput its weight behind Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden in 2020, reversing a longstanding fundraisingtrend that has favored the GOP,[405] but things might change in the near future, as before Biden came to power, atthe very top of Trump’s health care and drug policy world, there was a long list of people in his administration, whohad been bought and paid for by Big Pharma.[406] That’s why Trump is also so pro-vaccine in end. And has BenBartee, from The Daily Bell, wrote on the 28th of December 2021 “The spineless Republican leadership deservesjust as much scrutiny as the DNC (the functional political arm of the biomedical state) for their COVID failures —even more, given their self-styled role as the ‘resistance party’.”[407] Stat News reported in August 2020:The world’s biggest drugmakers and their trade groups have cut checks to 356 lawmakers ahead of thisyear’s election — more than two-thirds of the sitting members of Congress... Pfizer’s PAC has been the mostactive. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader seeking reelection in 2020... raked in more fromthe industry than any other lawmaker.[408]​ As Michael Rivero the host of the What Really Happened radio shows once said:Most people prefer to believe their leaders are just and fair even in the face of evidence to the contrarybecause once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which they live is lying and corrupt, the citizenhas to choose what he or she will do about it. To take action in the face of a corrupt government entails risks ofharm to life and loved ones. To choose to do nothing is to surrender one’s self-image of standing for principles.Most people do not have the courage to face that choice. Hence, most propaganda is not designed to fool thecritical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all.[409]​ After all, before the current pandemic took off, at the last in-person meeting arranged by Professor KlausSchwab in Davos, in January 2020, President Donald J. Trump, the “chaos magician,” said something that wasinevitably rejected by the increasing Socialist-minded elite present in Switzerland:This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, wemust reject the perennial profits of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs ofyesterday's foolish fortune tellers. They want to see us do badly, but we don't let that happen. They predicted anoverpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s. These alarmistsalways demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives.We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country, or eradicate our liberty.[410]​ Once again, one is left wondering if Trump does this simply to generate chaos and confusion, or if he isgenuine at times in his opposition towards the New World Order."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"In the last few months, the mainstream media of the Biden regime has talked a lot about asupposed epidemic of disinformation, to start increasing censorship. Even NIH Director Francis Collins condemnedthe “epidemic of misinformation, disinformation, and distrust that is tearing us apart.” But of course, much of themisinformation stemmed directly from the Biden administration’s constant flip-flops and fearmongering. TheOfficial Enemies List of this never-ending pandemic/plandemic, has expanded from those not wearing a mask tothose resisting getting the latest vaccine booster.​ On August 13, 2021, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a terrorist alert, warning lawenforcement agencies that “anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists could exploit... potential re-establishment of public health restrictions across the United States as a rationale to conduct attacks.” Anyone wholoudly objects to being locked back under house arrest will be the moral equivalent of the Taliban, or maybeHezbollah. Previous Federal driftnets for potential troublemakers expanded far beyond individuals who threatenedviolence.[411]The feds may already be compiling vast lists of COVID critics that could come in handy at some futurepoint and might include the author of this book. And I hope that is this context the Fourth Reich, does not follow theevil practices of the Third Reich when they started the infamous, “Nazi book burnings,” that were a campaignconducted by the German Student Union to ceremonially burn what they regarded as dangerous books in NaziGermany and Austria in the 1930s. The books targeted for burning were those viewed as being subversive, or asrepresenting ideologies opposed to Nazism.[412] For this and other reasons I suggest, in these unprecedented timeswe are living, to purchase this book and to also ask all your friends and family to purchase it before it might becensored or made no longer available. Remember, books have been suppressed in the past, even in the U.S., for theirpolitical content, by both local governments, and the Federal government. Uncomfortable books the establishmentperceived in the past as promoting anarchism, Communism, or Socialism (unpopular, of course, during the ColdWar), have had a history of being suppressed in the United States.[413] But in today’s America we might also startseeing conservative, and libertarian books, banned as well, so be ready and act accordingly.After the Soviet Union was formed in 1922, books gradually began to be aligned with Communistideology. However, some Russian writers who persevered within the totalitarian state and managed to create art outof hardship. The Bolshevik-led October Revolution of 1917 provided ideological justifications for restricting theflow of foreign ideas and analysis into the USSR. One of the first manifestations of this would be the creation of theMain Administration for Literary and Publishing Affairs, or Glavlit, aiming to purge Soviet society of allexpressions regarded as destructive to the new order and suppressing political dissidence.[414]​ In September 2021, Elizabeth Warren was accused of trying to 'circumvent the Constitution' by demandingAmazon to suppress books sold on the site, that she said included “misinformation” about coronavirus.[415]Fortunately, nobody listened to her insane request, but the Warrens of the world are on the rise, so we might seemore censorship requests like hers in the future. The problem in all this is the absolute compliance of the youngergenerations, more inclined than ever to submit to such madness, and for this reason, join without any opposition, theDemoncrats, and their sad “Woke” ideology. The Atlantic wrote back in March 2020 during the electioncountdown:Older people still see socialism and communism as dangerous, authoritarian political systems, whereasyounger people are more likely to see them as economic systems, and to care far less one way or another.[416]​ But 2021 also marked the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the end to the Soviet Union, the samecrumbling Communist nation that guested in the spring of 1988 the bare-chested, towel-draped, sitting at a tablelined with vodka bottles, Bernie Sanders, as he sang “This Land Is Your Land” to his comrades, during his nowalmost legendary 10-day ‘honeymoon’ in the Soviet Union, that shaped his future political views.[417] Unfortunately,the young people of today who follow Sanders in America, know nothing about the dangers of Communism, or thefact it was just as bad as Nazism in their authoritarian criminal ways. As outlined in the summer of 2021 by RichardM. Ebeling:During August 19-21, 1991, hardline members of the Soviet Communist Party and the KGB attempted a coupd’état in Moscow to prevent the political and economic reforms introduced over the prior five years from goingany further. The coup failed, and on Christmas Eve, 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved and disappearedfrom the political map of the world, but that’s not entirely true, as their perverse ideology, aka Communism,was still unfortunately alive and kicking, not only in Russia with its old aficionados, but also in China, Cuba,and many other countries worldwide, waiting for the right moment to come back even stronger than before. TheSoviet regime had ruled Russia and the other 14 component republics of the U.S.S.R. for nearly 75 years since"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917 led by Vladimir Lenin and his communist cadre of Marxistfollowers. During that almost three-quarters of a century, first under Lenin and especially Joseph Stalin andthen their successors, historians have estimated that upwards of 64 million people – innocent, unarmed men,women, and children – died at the hands of the Soviet regime in the name of building the “bright, beautifulfuture” of socialism.​ Of course, it was not a “beautiful future” but a future of hardships and oppression. In the meantime, theAmerican leftist mercenaries of the New World Order are also fighting us, using black magic publically under thedisguise of “Magical Resistance.” It happened when an Illuminati black magician from the O.T.O and Freemasoncalled Michael M. Hughes, created a magical movement during Trump’s past presidency to fight him magically onbehalf of the left. A move that might have helped ulteriorly the negative transformation of Donald J. Trump. Hugheseven published a book on the topic by the title MAGIC FOR THE RESISTANCE, that was praised by one of thecurrent leaders of the Ordo Templi Orientis named Lon Milo Duquette, who I have written extensively about inVolume 1 of my Confessions, who is a staunch leftist, and Bernie Sanders supporter, who wrote in the introductorypraises of Hughes infamous book: “Then...put your magic where your mouth is! You might want to start by readingMagic for the Resistance.” [418] In Hughes’s work in Chapter Three, he explains how he and a group of blackmagicians devised a ritual for “Binding Trump.”At midnight on February 24, 2017, about forty of my friends and I gathered around a bonfire in a backyardin Baltimore City to cast a binding spell on Donald Trump and all those who albeit him.[419]​ But Michael M. Hughes is not the first attempt to mix magic and liberal politics, and subjects dear to the left,like feminism, anti-white suprematism, and the unconditional support for the LGBTQ cause. In 1982, a similar bookcalled Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics written by feminist author Miriam Simos, who signs herselfwith the pen name Starhawk, was talking about magic, spirituality, leftist politics, ethics, and sex, in the same way.Along with Margot Adler's Drawing Down the Moon (1979), which also came out only three years earlier, the bookpoliticized practices of paganism and witchcraft by emphasizing their radical and feminist aspects, and as a result,drew many radical feminists into their orbit.[420] In Hughes’s book, we find feminist pioneer Victoria Woodhulldescribed by the libtard author as “Mrs. Satan: The Revolutionary Feminist Who Spoke to the Dead.”[421]Stating emphatically she not only “impressed millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt[422],” who later “helped her publish aweekly newspaper,” but also published “the first English translation of Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto.”[423] The truth is, we don’t need Michael M. Hughes’s Magical Resistance, or any connection with Communism andthe likes in politics with Jesus Christ in our lives, who constantly protect us from such evil. However, we need topray, now more than ever, and exorcise any demonic force trying to enter our lives through the ever-so diabolicrealm of politics, which I’m sorry to say seems corrupt beyond any possibility of being recovered.I’m writing this as proof to my readers, of the long-standing connection, between blackmagic and the left. After all, the National Socialist ideology, that blindly believed in the occult and gave us AdolfHitler, was itself an outgrowth of earlier political theories that came from the left, even if Hitler and his thugs,officially hated Socialism and Communism and worked to destroy those ideologies later. Imagine that when Hitlerpublically rejected Socialism, at the 1926 conference in Bamberg, that was organized by Nazi Party leaders over thevery question of the party’s ideological underpinnings, Joseph Goebbels, who idolized Hitler from the beginning,and would eventually become his infamous Reich Minister of Propaganda, wrote in his diary, “I feel as if someonehad knocked me on the head ... my heart aches so much. ... A horrible night! Surely one of the greatestdisappointments of my life. I do not believe Hitler without reservations anymore. That is what is terrible: I havebeen deprived of my inner self. I am only half.”[424]A rather dramatic statement from Goebbels, who like most of the Nazi elite of the time,loved Socialism, that was only rejected by Hitler to please his occult controllers in the American Illuminati, andpeople like Bush’s grandfather who helped Hitler’s rise to power and didn’t want him to assist in any wayCommunist-inspired movements, that were often linked to the growing threat of the Soviet Union. George W. Bush'sgrandfather, the late U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, a member of Skull and Bones, Yale's infamous Illuminati secretsociety, was, in fact, a director and shareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the financialbackers of Nazi Germany. The British paper The Guardian, obtained in 2004 confirmation from newly discoveredfiles in the U.S. National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financialarchitects of Nazism. His business dealings, which continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 underthe Trading with the Enemy Act, has led more than 60 years later, to a civil action for damages being brought inGermany against the Bush family by two former slave laborers at Auschwitz, to a hum of pre-election controversy."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"[425] A controversy, that reached Bush, when he was involved at the time, with a fellow member of the Skull andBones, John Kerry, who is now one of the most influential figures of Joe Biden’s administration, in the 2004 UnitedStates Presidential election. An election that, of course, turned out to be a farse, set up by the usual suspects to placeonce again in the White House, the “useful idiot” son of the late George Herbert Walker Bush (1924-2018), whowas a top Illuminati agent of the Luciferian court of the Jesuits. Before Obama, and Joe Biden came along, PresidentGeorge W. Bush was considered a hero by most conservatives, but for some researchers, like Eric John Phelps, whoknew the Jesuits were controlling him all long, thought otherwise, stressing the fact George W. Bush was “the mostCatholic president we’ve ever had.”[426] That’s why Bush in recent years, has finally shown his true Socialist colors,becoming the new darling of the left, suddenly championing the progressive ideals of Pope Francis, and becomingloved even by The Guardian[427], who exposed, many years ago, his grandfather’s connection to the Nazi’s. FormerPresident George W. Bush is even jumping into 2022’s heated Republican primary races, as revealed in late January2022, opening his pocketbook to two GOP lawmakers caught in his Republican successor Donald Trump’scrosshairs. Campaign finance disclosures show Bush donated to the re-election campaigns of Wyoming swampcreature Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of his former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Republican In Name Only(RINO) Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski.[428] In this context, we should all remember Eric John Phelps’s warningsabout him in his book Vatican Assassins.He is surrounded by cardinals. From the beginning of his presidency, George [W.] Bush has been promotingthe Vatican-Nazi Jesuit agenda. Two months into his presidency, surrounded by cardinals of Rome, thePresident dedicated a cultural center in Washington, D.C., to the greatest enemy this Republic has ever had,the Pope of Rome. Bush declared that he is going to enforce the words and teachings of the Pope here inAmerica. [According to Patricia Zapoa of the Catholic News Service, March 24, 2001] President Bush said,“The best way to honor Pope John Paul II, truly one of the greatest men, is to take his teachings seriously,to listen to his words and put his words and his teachings into action here in America.”[429]​ Phelps later added:Every President from Johnson to Clinton, and now Bush, has been the abject tool of the Order fulfilling“Jesuitical Politics” — treasonous, internationalist and plotting to make its “infallible” Pope, ruling Satan’sTheocratic Kingdom offered to the Lord Jesus Christ, “the Universal Monarch of the World.”[430]​ But things have changed in the DNA of the Republican party in recent years thanks to Donald J. Trump, whomight have lost his political sense and the honesty of his mission in recent times but has always hated the Bushfamily. For this reason, even the perception of Hitler has changed among most conservatives that are fully consciousof his leftist background and denounce it publically. At the end of the Mueller investigation, Alabama Rep. MoBrooks who took to the House floor to denounce the probe as “the big lie” linked the event to what he said wasanother of history’s greatest lies. Discussing special counsel Robert Mueller’s nearly two-year farse/investigationinto President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign’s ties with Russia (that didn’t exist!), Brooks rightly said, “SocialistDemocrats and their fake news allies ... have perpetrated the biggest political lie, con, scam, and fraud in Americanhistory.” Brooks, went on, saying, “In that vein, I quote from another Socialist who mastered big lie propaganda to amaximum, and deadly, effect.” And then, after reading a long quote about how “broad masses of a nation are alwaysmore easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature,” Brooks got to his conclusion I consider 100%correct: “Who is this big lie master? That quote was in 1925 by a member of Germany’s National Socialist GermanWorkers’ Party—that’s right, Germany’s Socialist party—more commonly known as the Nazis. The author wassocialist Adolf Hitler, in his book Mein Kampf.” And Brooks was somehow not alone at the time in making the“Nazis were Socialists” argument in Congress. Rep. Louis Gohmert did the same, during a House JudiciaryCommittee meeting about a GOP resolution on the Mueller probe in which he said the Justice Department could, inthe future, enable “another socialist like Hitler to come along.” The leftist propagandist of the Vox, immediatelywent on record to criticize and possibly hide Hitler’s connections to socialism and the left, dismissing them as“hilariously incorrect,” to protect the link to their “Woke” ideology and Marxism that is currently spreading like awildfire in today’s America.There are many, many, many things wrong with Rep. Brooks’s and Rep. Gohmer’s understanding of Nazism,from a basic misunderstanding of Nazism and Nazi ideology to what I term the ‘Americanization’ of Nazism:an effort to put Nazi Germany somewhere on the American political axis, where it very much does not belong.But one of their core assumptions — “Nazis were socialists” — has become one of the biggest memes within a"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"swath of the American Right. And it is woefully, almost hilariously incorrect.[431] Of course, Vox can keep on with their lies, that are “hilariously incorrect,” but we need to prepare for the increaseof censorship, as these servants of the New World Order simply advance their Nazi-Communism 2.0 agenda for theGreat Reset initiative to be implemented. The Covert-1984 PSYOPS is the rollout of the New World Order and theA.I. advancement is here to lead all of us soon towards the transhumanism Matrix if we don’t all embrace myconcept of Great Reject that I’m trying to outline in this book. “We were just following directives,” say thehypnotized zombie living in denial, while they comply with anything the Jesuit “Mengele’s” of our world areproposing, but history is on “repeat mode” unfortunately, and we need to avoid the same errors of the past to stopKlaus Schwab, George Soros, Bill Gates, and all the other Jesuit/Sabbatean agents of “Lucifer’s court,” that was, bythe way also the title of Otto Rahn’s personal diary from his travels as an occult investigator for the Third Reich, butwe are now approaching the Fourth Reich under the direct supervision of the previously mentioned Ahriman not theFührer. Scholar John R. Hinnels describes Ahriman's nature in this way:He is the demon of demons, and dwells in an abyss of endless darkness in the north, the traditional home ofthe demons. Ignorance, harmfulness, and disorder are the characteristics of Ahriman. He can change hisoutward form and appear as a lizard, a snake, or a youth. His aim is always to destroy the creation of [AhuraMazda] and to this end he follows behind the creator's work, seeking to spoil it. As Ahura Mazda creates life,Ahriman creates death; for health, he produces disease; for beauty, ugliness. All man's ills are due entirely toAhriman.[432]​ In Rabbinical Literature Ahriman (Angro-mainyush) is mentioned in Sanhedrin, 39a: Amemar, on being toldby one of the Magi, “The upper half of thy body belongs to Ormuzd, the good principle; the lower to Ahriman, theevil principle,” replies satirically, \"Why, then, does Ahriman permit Ormuzd to carry the water (the excreta) throughhis province?\" The whole conception of Ahriman as the antagonist of the divine principle of goodness haspermeated Judaism in many ways.[433] Angro-mainyush, Angra Mainyu, or Aŋra Mainiiu is the Avestan-languagename that describes in Zoroastrianism's the “destructive/evil spirit,” and the main adversary of Ahura Mazda,regarded as their highest deity. Rudolf Steiner used the concept of Ahriman to name one of two extreme forceswhich pull humanity away from the centering influence of Christ[434], but we also have The Opus SanctorumAngelorum, an international movement within the Catholic Church ordered to promote devotion to the HolyAngels[435], that defines Ahriman as a “demon in the Rank of Fallen Powers.”It says his duty is to obscure humanbrains from the Truth of God.[436]"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"FIG. 42 –– Catholic booklet OPUS SANCTORUM ANGELORUM The Work of the Holy Angels.Kurzweil and the Computerized Incarnation of Ahriman I might not agree with all of Rudolph’s Steiner’s “Gnostic Doctrines and Supersensible Influences,” to use partof the title of a lecture he gave in Dornach, on July 15, 1923, but I still find his studies on “the character of certainspiritual impulses, which have been at work in the course of evolution and have led on to the present state of affairsin the world[437],” not only fascinating but also partly agreeable with, including his take on the infamous figure ofAhriman, central to this book.      The Steiner Online Library (SOL) a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established to increase public awareness ofAnthroposophy in the United States, published online, in April 2017, a very interesting perspective of theincarnation of Ahriman through the medium of Artificial Intelligence, a very interesting article that I will analyze indetail in the coming pages. Steiner’s contemporary students as you will see, confirm 100% what I have alreadyoutlined in my prior work, Vol.6.66, a book where I have talked extensively about the new concept of Cyber Satan,and it was MIT professor Norbert Wiener (1894-1964), cited in the article in question published on the SOL, whocoined the term “Cybernetics.” Wiener did this to characterize a very general science of “control andcommunication in the animal and machine.” Like author and researcher, David Livingstone, explains in hisbrilliant book Transhumanism: The History of a Dangerous Idea, “Like MK Ultra, the personal computer was aproject of the Cybernetics Group” that he rightly claims was “designed to provide the ultimate tool of socialcontrol.”[438] Livingstone arrives also to the absolute correct conclusion, that knowing that the rest of society wouldeasily recognize the pervasive deployment of computers in every household as an intrusion of “Big Brother,” thehippie counterculture that was aligned from the start with the nascent technology of culture in California, willmarket the computer instead, as a tool of personal liberation, and the pioneer in this diabolic project, known amongits members as the “Man-Machine Project,” was John von Neumann (1903-1957), one of the Cybernetics Group’sleaders, known for his work in mathematics and computer science.[439] According to American historian andpolitical scientist, Jeffrey Steinberg, in an article entitled “From Cybernetics to Littleton: Techniques of MindControl” that appeared over twenty years ago in the May 2000, issue of Executive Intelligence Review:For John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener, the core of the Cybernetics Group project was the developmentof computers, and the prospect of combining high-speed computers with so-called Artificial Intelligence, toliterally “program” the human race. Underlying all of these efforts was the unshakable, albeit preposterousconviction, most avidly presented by von Neumann, that there was nothing sacred about the human mind, andthat the human brain was a machine, whose functioning could be replicated, and eventually surpassed, bycomputers.[440]​ The disciples of Rudolph Steiner seem to understand the dangers of all this. “The computer is transformingour society and our way of life. At first confined to the central offices of large corporations, scientific researchinstitutions, and government agencies, computers are finding widespread application in automobiles, appliances, andsmall businesses. In 1980, about 400,000 ‘personal computers’ were sold, bringing the computer as such into manyof our lives, more directly than the ubiquitous computer-generated bill. Many people have grown concerned aboutthe changes resulting from the spread of computers. While few would maintain that having armies of clerks addingcolumns of figures is better (for the clerks or the rest of us) than having computers do the work, people complainthat they are being dehumanized, reduced to a number or a machine, being made servants of inhuman masters, and,in general, feeling their lives changed in ways they cannot control and do not like. While computers give uswelcome relief from drudgery, they have other effects which we do not welcome.Norbert Wiener took up this theme as early as 1948. [441] He described the unprecedentedrapidity of the changes, that science and technology brought to society, and emphasized the key role played bycybernetics in bringing this about in its later stages. He also described some of the evil consequences of the changesbut seemed to feel that the evil resided in the social aspect of the new situation, in the uses to which we are puttingour new powers.”[442] ​ In the 1989 edition of Wiener’s book The Human Use of Human Beings, which was first published in 1950and revised in 1954, we find the following description in the opening page, that might help you understand more theinfluence of his groundbreaking work:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"This is one of the fundamental documents of our time, a period characterized by the concepts of 'information'and 'communications'. Norbert Wiener, a child prodigy and a great mathematician, coined the term'cybernetics' to characterize a very general science of 'control and communication in the animal and machine'.It brought together concepts from engineering, the study of the nervous system, and statistical mechanics (e.g.entropy). From there, he developed concepts that have become pervasive through science (especially biologyand computing) and common parlance: 'in formation', 'message', 'feedback' and 'control'. He wrote, 'thethought of every age is reflected in its technique . . . If the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries are theage of clocks, and the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries constitute the age of steam engines, the presenttime is the age of communication and control.'In this volume, Norbert Wiener spells out his theories for the general reader and reflects on the socialissues raised by the dramatically increasing role of science and technology in the new age - the age in whichwe are now deeply and problematically embroiled. His cautionary remarks are as relevant now as they werewhen the book first appeared in the 1950s. [443]​ Wiener describes the unprecedented rapidity, of the changes that science, and technology brought to society,and emphasized the key role played by cybernetics in bringing this about in its later stages. For Steiner’s followers,he also described some of the evil consequences of the changes but seemed to feel that the evil resided in the socialaspect of the new situation, in the uses to which we are putting our new powers. Since Wiener's time, the fieldknown as “artificial intelligence,” in which one tries to make computers mimic human intelligence, has beenestablished and grown. What started out as dumb, fast machines have developed into automatons that areincreasingly able to exhibit human-like characteristics. Joseph Weizenbaum, who devised a program to carry on anintimate conversation in English with a person, reported[444] his dismay when people took what he imagined to be aclever experiment completely seriously. For example, “Some practicing psychiatrists seriously believed theDOCTOR computer program would grow into a nearly complete automatic form of psychotherapy.”[445]​ Amidst other important observations and insights, Weizenbaum worried about how, as machines grow morecapable, we imagine ourselves less capable, more like machines, and grow more committed to a mindlessly“scientistic” [446] approach to the world. The disciples of Steiner also point out how some people have the idea thatthings with the computer are getting out of control, that the machines are acquiring a kind of autonomy. “Insummarizing her recent survey of 50 computer owners, Sherry Turkle, an associate professor of sociology at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, said consumers liked the feeling of power associated with programming acomputer. 'When you program a computer, you feel a great deal of control and mastery,' she said. 'People begin witha desire to make the computer do something and end up being absorbed by its doing something to them,' she said.”[447]​ This experience of having the tables turned on one is being repeated at many levels and in many contexts.This brings us to the idea that the computer is no ordinary machine, that it can wield a power over us that no meretool could. What is it about the computer that makes it special? To me, as well as the students of Rudoph Steiner,this is no abstract question.After programming computers at an advanced level for many years and watching what happened to me andto others who developed intimate relationships with the machines, I confronted this question with a sense ofpersonal urgency and in a troubled mood. Most of the experiences I had were not discussed by those whoworked with me; indeed, in the atmosphere that attaches itself to computers, certain things about the machinesare nearly unthinkable, though nonetheless true. I had no desire to engage in a romantic reaction againstmachines or to struggle against rationality in any way. What troubled me was that I felt my reasoning powersbeing boxed in and limited, and I found it difficult to be as rational about all of my experience as I wished tobe. I felt the need for more understanding, not less, and began to realize that the computer itself had somethingto do with my lack of intellectual penetration. What happened to me many other people have also experiencedin varying degrees. Specifically, I noticed that my thinking became more refined and exact, able to carry outextensive logical analyses with facility, but at the same time more superficial and less tolerant of ambiguity orconflicting points of view. My feeling life somehow gradually detached itself from the rest of me. The feelingsthat were closer to me grew flat and grey; they lost their strength and color and correspondingly played a lessprominent role in my life. The feelings that were farther from me, on the other hand, grew stronger and cruder;they lost much of their human quality and modulation. Finally, in the life of the will, I developed a tremendouscapacity for application to the solution of problems connected with the computer, and an ability for sustained"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"intellectual concentration far above average so long as the focus of concentration was the computer. In otherareas, I lost willpower, and what I had taken on an obsessive character. Many other things happened to me aswell, but the transformations I have just described are of a general nature, widely experienced, and will servefor the present. The computer is special because of its relation to the spiritual being here called“Ahriman.”[448]​ The name Ahriman, comes, as I said earlier, from the Zoroastrian god of darkness, the being eternallyopposed to the god of light, who is called Ormazd (also called Ahura Mazda). In Rudolf Steiner's gnostic conceptionthat influences his followers, “Ahriman is opposed to Lucifer (literally, light-vessel), and the two of them togetherare opposed by the redeeming power of Christ. Steiner's thought is formally similar to the one advanced by Aristotlein the Nichomachean Ethics, in which evil is pictured as having the form of mutually contradictory excessiveopposites, both of which are opposed by a good which stands at the mean of the two evils.“ The general idea ofSteiner’s students, or at least the one we are citing in this context is that ”the world has been coming increasinglyunder the sway of this being Ahriman in the course of the last two millennia, with an ever-increasing pace in recentcenturies, and that the computer represents the vanguard of this development.” And I completely agree with thisanalysis, that’s why the Artificial Intelligence emanating from these computers, is, after all, inherently evil ifconnected to Ahriman, that’s why I have promoted in my books the definition of “Cyber Satan.”After all, humantools of this ongoing demonic transformation of mankind towards obtaining the ultimate “Cyber Satan,” likeRaymond Kurzweil, for example, who is a supporter of Klaus Schwab’s “Fourth Industrial Revolution” [449] akaFourth Reich, believes that in the 21st century a “strong AI” will emerge as an inherently uncontrollable super-intelligence. However, Kurzweil, who reminds me of the fictional nerdy villain Peter Isherwell, in the Netflixfilm Don't Look Up (2021), and holds intelligence as the highest value, has a frightening vision for humans thatculminates with swarms of nanobots blasting out into the cosmos, saturating “dumb matter” with intelligence, whileusing the stars and planets, including our beloved sun, as computational substrates. His shocking description of theultimate cold computer and the possible computational potential of black holes, really shows the dark extreme of hisdangerous thought, which is also described very well by Benjamin Butler, in a review of Ray Kurzweil’s book TheSingularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology (2005):Ray Kurzweil foresees a future in which each organ of the human being is gradually replaced by intelligentnanobots or otherwise synthetic materials. The heart and brain are seen as flawed in design, badly in need ofan upgrade, because they are run by outdated biological programming. Kurzweil describes his discomfort withhis physical body thus he seeks to radically “reprogram” it by taking 250 pills a day to completely change hismetabolic processes. He does this so he can live for further biotechnological innovations that allow humanswithin a few decades to become immortal by uploading their consciousness into computers. He sees the“nonbiological” intelligence increasingly taking over inside augmented human beings as biotechnology comesto replace their biological brain.[450]​ So according to the World Economic Forum, the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” is here. It’s a change assignificant as any modern revolution before it. And if we look, we’ll see the signs. If the first three industrialrevolutions brought us the steam engine, electricity, and global communication, the fourth revolution merges thedigital, physical, and biological. As Ray Kurzweil often says, this trajectory will eventually eliminate the barriersbetween man and machine.[451] But this might also mean the end of mankind as we know it. “One of the features ofthis Fourth Industrial Revolution is that it doesn’t change what we are doing, but it changes us,” says Klaus Schwab,founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. To some degree, we’re already engaging in thissymbiotic relationship today and the nightmare has only started with seemingly innocent changes. Like Kurzweilpoints out, “at some point, we will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking. But is a gradualtransition.”[452]​ Wireless earphones, for instance, signal a symbolic shift toward hardware devices more intimately connectingwith our daily lives—slowly chipping away the “middleman” between our thoughts and digital activities. Inhealthcare, a concept called “quantified self” already allows end-users to measure, track and change habits usingpersonalized sensors connected directly to our bodies.[453] I saw a recent ad about it on an American TV channel andwas shocked, to say the least, by what they are proposing. The future is already here, and to be honest, is a veryscary one indeed, especially for those with eyes to see what’s happening behind this. How can we prepare and adaptto these changes then? Professor Schwab suggests, “The response to (the Fourth Industrial Revolution) must beintegrated and comprehensive, involving all stakeholders of the global polity, from the public and private sectors to"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"academia and civil society.”[454] That’s why they have opened the gates of hell in the last few years to obtain theirevil goals. FIG. 43 –– The head of Ahriman was carved in wood by Dr. Rudolf Steiner who prophesied the birth of the Anti-Christ in America in the second halfof the 20th century (Barack Obama?).The Portals of Hell initially Opened by the Swiss Illuminati The opening of the gates, or portals of hell, that we are all witnessing in the last few years, didn’t happen in oneday, or one place. In 2016, for example, the world was shocked by some unusual events, that happened right in theheart of Europe, in Switzerland to be precise, where the German Illuminati always had a very relevant presence andthe place where Professor Klaus Schwab, launched his Jesuit-driven project that will culminate in the Great Resetinitiative. I know you always thought, Swiss Cheese, Swiss Chocolate and Swiss Alps, were the only things thatSwitzerland had to offer, aside, of course, from their famous banks, but that’s not the case, there is also a hiddendark side. Maybe a glimpse into the world of the Swiss Illuminati will help us understand this.​ The German scholar Lothar Diehl, born in 1937, author of the excellent trilogy Initiatory Orders andMystery Schools, who used to be one of the leaders of the Gnostic Catholic Church, the Order of the Illuminati, andthe pre-Crowleyan O.T.O. based in Switzerland (known as the Metzger O.T.O.), located in the village of Stein inGerman-speaking Switzerland, so dear to Schwab’s family, wrote the following in the first volume of his trilogy:“The deviate Arcanum of sexual power is reflected, in the twisted practices of the so-called, “Libertine” gnosticsocieties, (known for their sexual excesses), and are not to be compared to the authentic traditional gnosticchurches.”[455] So, was Lothar himself practicing these deviant practices? Well, we might never know this, at leastfor the time being, mainly because from September 2009, the official activities of the Swiss O.T.O. Illuminatibranch, that involved the same Lothar Diehl, ceased, as they were formally put to sleep (as you say in Masonicterms), with an official declaration signed by the committee in charge of the estate of the so-called Abbey ofThelema in Stein, known as the Aeshbach Foundation, controlled by Enst Graf and Adalbert Schmid. Maybe theoverexposure of this secretive group of Swiss Illuminati Freemasons, that found themselves suddenly connected toAleister Crowley after the launch of the World Wide Web, brought them to this decision, probably due to thedifficult choice made in the past by their late leader Hermann Joseph Metzger (1919-1990), who initially refusedCrowleyanity, and the perverse sexual magickal practices of “The Great Beast”, Aleister Crowley, in an attempt topreserve the integrity of his various Orders, and the dignity of its members, but then accepted it covertly, dedicatingregularly to Thelema, a Gnostic Mass in his Abbey.Metzger, who was once considered the outer head of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), at least inGerman-speaking countries, was born in Zezikon, Switzerland, on June 20, 1919. Little is known of his youth. Heconsidered the priesthood at one time but eventually became a Marxist. He emerged out of obscurity in 1939 when"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"he moved from Lugano (in Italian-speaking Switzerland) to Zürich. During World War II (1939-45), under the stagename Peter Mano, he worked as a stage magician and also was an astrologer. In February 1947, he inherited fromhis Illuminati mentor Felix Lazerus Pinkus (1881-1947), who had just died, a small publishing firm, calledPsychosophische Gesellschaft.​ Pinkus, who was an influential Jewish Sabattean Illuminati, and Bnai Brith member,[456] had been in his 30s,the president of the Zionist society in Zurich, as well as editor of the Economist, but after some financial troublesand turbulent life in support of the Jewish cause, became very active not only socially, but also magically in theSwiss and Austrian theosophical milieu of those years creating his esoteric group. Pinkus knew very well the peoplein charge of the Escher Wyss company in Zurich, that had the direct involvement of Schwab’s family, so there is apossible direct connection there that might need some further investigation, as, over the next decades, Metzger'sactivities would be underwritten by a wealthy friend, Annemarie Aeschbach, who also knew the Schwab’s, and metKlaus personally in the 1960s in an art gallery she owned until 1983 on the Löwenstrasse in Zurich, near the oldestand largest synagogue in town.Interestingly, the fact that Pinkus had become Mezter’s “spiritual father” got him immediatelythe IX° degree of the O.T.O. In fact, after the war, Hermann Joseph Metzger founded a lodge of the O.T.O, then ledinternationally by Karl Johannes Germer (1885-1962). He also joined the World League of the Illuminati, theorganization that had attempted to revive the eighteenth-century German Illuminati connected to the previouslymentioned Theodor Reuss and Leopold Engel, after a new branch of the Illuminati was activated in Switzerland atthe end of the 1940s by Karl Brodbeck,[457] connected to the Austrian Illuminati, that was revived in the same periodafter World War II by Hermann Medinger.[458]​ In 1955, the leader of the Swiss chapter of the World League of the Illuminati died and left the smallorganization to Metzger. In 1957, he was consecrated as a bishop in the Gnostic Catholic Church, one of severalsmall ecclesiastical bodies that traced its apostolic succession to the mystical consecration of French bishop Jules-Benoit Doniel (1842-1894). Then in 1960, Metzger became the new patriarch of the church. In 1963, after hearingof the death of Germer, he called the German-speaking leadership of the O.T.O. together and had himself elected thenew international outer head of the order (though those in the Spanish-and English-speaking countries did notrecognize him). By this time, Metzger was already putting together a new organization that would unite theteachings and practices of the several organizations he had inherited. His headquarters was established in Appenzell,in northeast Switzerland. A variety of cottage industries emerged, from a bakery to a movie theater. There was also achapel for the gatherings of the so-called “Gnostic Catholic Church,” founded by Crowley. Metzger led the groupuntil he fell ill toward the end of the 1980s. He died on July 14, 1990. His ashes are kept enshrined at the chapel atAppenzell.[459]This branch of the Illuminati, connected to the Sabbatean-Frankist Messianic Conspiracy, waspretty successful, until the growing influence and pressure exercised since 1999 by the U.S. CIA driven CaliphateO.T.O., that likes to be the only O.T.O. in town, and like I explained earlier, the obsessive interest showed by manyweirdos throughout the internet, led this rather reserved and private group of Swiss, and Austrian Freemasons,involved in the Illuminati workings in Stein, to cease all their official activities. On top of this, the death ofMetzger’s wealthy successor Annemarie Aeschbach “Soror Chockmah” (1926-2008)—who after Metzger died in1990, took the role of supreme guide and patron of all the Orders involved in the Abbey of Thelema in Stein, mighthave pushed this one-time mecca of the Swiss Illuminati to rediscuss their future. Sabbatean Frankist Jew Peter-Robert Koenig, the self-proclaimed historian of the O.T.O. Swiss Illuminati, and a figure of the Swiss occult milieuthat I speak of in-depth about in Vol.1 of my Confessions[460], stated in 2009 that:The Gnostic Catholic Church’s Crowleyan Masses are performed, without a break, as usual, on alternateSundays. The museum and library remain active, as well as Order operations. The finances have been mergedwith those of the Aeschbach-Stiftung, which is overseen by the cantonal authorities and run by a FoundationCommittee, headed by Ernst Graf and Adalbert Schmid; the latter looks after the library and the estatebusiness. Besides being the new president of the Psychosophische Gesellschaft, Graf is also its vice-president.A financial cushion results from the sale of the Haus Schedlern, where Fraeulein Aeschbach once lived; thisalso overcame any financial hurdles that might have thwarted the Society’s successful continuation. Newmembers were also taken on.[461]​ Koenig’s claims are not supported by any hard evidence, but is public “revelations” may be connected to hisgrowing role in the last years of the Stein initiatic reality that he has directly participated in, and are probablyendorsed by some of the older members of this branch of the Illuminati, to maintain an aura of mystery and intriguearound the present business of the estate, which includes a small museum dedicated to the Illuminati, that is"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"probably the only one in the world. The continued interest might also help Koenig sell more of his books on thesubject, and at the same time recruit new members for a more secretive eliterian kind of reality, that can avoid publicscrutiny.However, the end of all official Illuminati activities in Stein in 2009, was confirmed in 2011, byLashtall, the official publication of the Sovrano Ordine del Tempio della Via della Luce (S.O.T.V.L.), anindependent Italian branch of Crowley’s Illuminati, based in Bellinzago Novarese near Novara in Northern Italy.[462]Karl Germer aka Frater Saturnus, who was Crowley’s disciple, and chief representative in the United States, afterthe Second World War, once warned the founder of S.O.T.O., Marcelo Ramos Motta, about the feared SwissIlluminati, the “the Swiss Group,” as Germer used to call them, denouncing one of its members, Sabbatean FrankistOscar Schlag, saying he was not sincere in his passion for Thelema and “A.C.” (Aleister Crowley). Describing in theprocess, the very interesting connections that the Swiss members seem to have with “such things as C.I.A., F.B.I.,and whatnot”:... It seems to me that you want to get initiated into the Netherworld of enemies, spies, and that typequickly, at an earlier period of life than I, anyway ... As soon as anyone contacts Thelema, and especially if hedoes actual work for it, he or she gets the kindest attention, not only attacks. What they prefer is to win himover back into their fold, and subtly work against 93, while pretending to be an exponent for it ... This, I amafraid, is the case with the Swiss group. Yes, I warned you years ago against Schlag. He is a Jew, High-GradeMason, hates the O.T.O., is a political trouble-maker, psychologist, seems to have plenty of money, travels allover the globe, is in touch with such things as C.I.A., F.B.I., and whatnot. He has possibly the greatest occultlibrary extant, has every scrap that A.C. ever issued, has things Thelemic that I do not have myself. The lasttime I ever saw him was in New York in a hotel; he boasted that he had the only handwritten copy of The Bookof the Law in A.C.’s hand. When challenged, he brought it down to the car, and I spotted at once the origin—tohis great chagrin ...[463]​ Of course, Peter-Robert Koenig, was by his admission, a friend of the late Illuminati, homosexual spy, and“political trouble-maker,” Oscar Schlag[464] who considered himself the reincarnation of none other than CarlKellner. Let’s not forget that Kellner, as I mentioned earlier, was the founder of the O.T.O., and the late Schlag isalso indicated as an alleged “psychological warfare” specialist from Israel.[465] “the Swiss Group,” seem to havealways been a very important outpost for the Sabbatean-Frankists.I wanted to talk about them in detail because I want to introduce you first to the occult reality around the SwissIlluminati, before moving further in my description of the opening of the gates of hell and other diableries thathappened there in Switzerland in 2016, after all, the Headquarters of the infamous World Health Organization is alsoin Switzerland.​ In 2016, Europe’s most powerful people attended a bizarre Satanic opening ceremony in Switzerland for theinauguration of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, a dark, disturbing, and weird, Illuminati ritual made in public, thatindicated the elite was no longer hiding their true Satanic beliefs. Measuring over 57 km and costing over 11 billionEuros, the Gotthard Base Tunnel became the world’s longest and most expensive tunneling project in history andwas said to be a symbol of European unification in a context of rising nationalism and closing borders (the usualleftist propaganda). While most would expect an upbeat, celebratory ceremony for this kind of event, the guestswere treated to a disturbing show orchestrated by German director Volker Hesse, where a man dressed as a goatpresided over what was a Satanic/Luciferian ritual.What does this have to do with the building of a tunnel? Mass media, in its attempts atdelegitimizing any occult interpretation of the event, stated that there are mountain goats in the Alp which explainedin their eyes the appearance of the infamous goat-man. But why was the goat-man in such a position of powerduring the ceremony? Why were people bowing down to him with reverence? The ceremony appeared to drawinspiration from local folk tales, specifically the legend about The Devil’s bridge, which goes through GotthardPass. The legend of this particular bridge states that a Swiss herdsman asked the devil to help him build a bridge.The devil appeared but required that the soul of the first to cross the bridge once it was built would be given to him.The mountaineer agreed with Satan, but drove a goat across ahead of him, fooling his adversary. Angered by thissham, the devil fetched a rock, intending to smash the bridge, but an old woman drew a cross on the rock so thedevil could not lift it anymore. The rock is still there and, in 1977, 300,000 Swiss francs were spent to move the220-ton rock by 127 meters to make room for the new Gotthard road tunnel.While the devil lost in the old Swiss legend I just unveiled, he appears instead to have won inthe tunnel’s opening ceremony of 2016 that turned a great work of engineering into a religious ceremony dedicated"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"to Baphomet, while somewhat ridiculing in the process the workers who sacrificed their lives, and even the masseswho will travel through the tunnel. After portraying the workers as zombie soldiers, the ceremony portrays thegeneral population as a bunch of lascivious people who appear to be extremely suggestible, and that’s unfortunatelythe sad reality of today’s world. Then, emerging from a train passing through the tunnel there is a demonic fallenangel, a baby-faced Lucifer, and at the end of this dark Satanic ceremony, a woman draped the goat-man in white asshe was saying “You are now the king of the world” and Europe’s most powerful people stood up and gave astanding ovation to this ceremony dedicated to the true ruler of the occult elite.[466]Albert Pike Sovereign GrandCommander of the Supreme Council, Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, USA) from 1859 to 1889 wrote aboutLucifer in his Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry:LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Sonof the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfishSouls? Doubt it not! for traditions are full of Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and Inspiration is not of oneAge nor one Creed. Plato and Philo, also, were inspired. The Apocalypse, indeed, is a book as obscure as theSohar.[467]​ At the time of the inauguration of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, I made a video exposing it on the now-defunctchannel of my wife, IlluminatiPrincess33, talking about the opening of the gates of hell that seemed back then stillfar fetched to most people, but then something even weirder happened in Switzerland a couple of months later,during the “strange” summer of 2016. During the month of August, a video suddenly appeared online, with imagesof what appeared to be a human sacrifice, staged on the grounds of the European Organization for Nuclear Research(CERN), the famous home of the God Particle featured in Dan Brown’s bestseller Angels and Demons. The videothat circulated online showed mysterious hooded figures engaging in an apparent magic ritual, staged in the middleof the night, under a huge statue of a Hindu deity. In the finale, a woman was stabbed, or so it appears. The deity inquestion is a Shiva statue that India donated to CERN in the 1960s. Shiva is known in the Hindu religion as “TheDestroyer” within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. However, for the Illuminati, theterm destruction as it relates to Shiva’s cosmic duties can be deceiving, because often Lord Shiva destroys negativepresences such as evil, ignorance, and death. The mainstream media quickly went on record stating that the shockingfootage appeared to have been recorded as part of a supposed prank, made by some scientists based at Europe’s topphysics lab, which also serves as the home of the Lagre Hadron Collider.The identity and motives of those behind the video were never revealed. CERN and theNew World Order built this institution and accepted this statue from India due to the popularity the image hadacquired among the Illuminati elite and many physicists in the last century. The De Broglie theory and Max Plank’stheories “Dual Nature of Matter” are a common concept in Saiva Siddantham, and almost all Tamil Siddhars havestrong beliefs on the dual nature of matter and a parallel universe, multiverse, and wormholes, which is what CERNis working on to open the gates of hell.The Hindu concept is that humans don’t live or die, we just appear in many universes at thesame time in different dimensions, and this is the most common foundation for Siddha Shastrams in the Hindu faith,however, Shiva “The Destroyer,” was about to appear once again a few years later in a key meeting for the NewWorld Order. A photo that posted on Twitter three years ago, by none other than the controversial head of the WorldHealth Organization (WHO ), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, showed to the whole world the presence of thesame image of Shiva “The Destroyer,” so dear to the dark side of the Illuminati, during an important meeting thatwas set up before the start of the pandemic (plandemic?), between the WHO and Chinese officials, focused on theinfamous Belt and Road Initiative.[468]​ The presence of this religious statue overseeing the event in question, seems now like a bad omen and a clearmessage to all of us, after the last two years of this never-ending pandemic. The photo was posted in January 2019on the Twitter feed of Dr. Tedros, who has served as the alleged corrupt Director-General of the World HealthOrganization since 2017. The fact the Hindu god, Shiva “The Destroyer” was so prominently displayed at the headof the table during this important meeting, confirms once again the obsession that the Illuminati have for Shiva andthe key role of Dr. Tedros, in bed with China from the very start of this conspiracy against mankind. The tweet inquestion stated we should celebrate the WHO’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the so-called“New Silk Road” by supporting the “overseas training of more than 2,000 Chinese health workers,” but the problemis, “The Belt and Road Initiative” has nothing to do with health work, but rather with a Chinese economic takeoverof the entire world with the help of Klaus Schwab, and the Jesuit Sabbatean Frankist mafia. That’s why we have all"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"witnessed during this plandemic/pandemic a complete loss of credibility by the WHO institution, that has not evenbeen able to reveal, until now at least, the real origins of this virus/biological warfare connected to the ChineseMilitary, as well as the U.S. Deep State and Jesuit agents like Dr. Anthony Fauci and his infamous Gain of FunctionResearch, and other diableries, that have actively helped fund the research of Chinese military scientists in thissector for decades.For example, research grant number R01AI098775 “RBD recombinant protein-based SARSvaccine for biodefense” amounting to over $1 million per year, was awarded by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to Professor Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine as theProject Leader, but one of the two other principal investigators on this project was also Shibo Jiang, who during hisover 20 years of working in the United States, developed an extensive network of collaborative research withvarious U.S. virus research laboratories, receiving more than $17 million in U.S. research grants, the vast majoritycoming from Fauci’s NIAID. During the entire period of his research here in the U.S., Shibo Jiang activelycollaborated with People’s Liberation Army laboratories, while simultaneously inviting and training into his U.S.laboratory, scientists linked to the Chinese military.[469] ​ The New Silk Road is a trojan horse, that aims to link China to Europe and Africa involving countries likeItaly, in particular, which surprise, surprise became the first epicenter of the CCP virus pandemic in the OldContinent. Formerly named One Belt One Road(OBOR), the name was changed in 2016 when the Chinesegovernment considered the emphasis on the word“one” was prone to misinterpretation around their project, maybeto hide their real intention to establish a One World Government controlled by China. However, the term “One BeltOne Road” is still used in Chinese state media that have now added a “Green” touch to the whole initiative under thedirectives of the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Green finance is officially promoted as animportant feature of the Belt and Road Initiative, which calls for an environmentally friendly \"Green Belt andRoad.” Chinese policy documents for the project coordinator and encourage green finance and investment, but thereal secret objectives of the CCP are to create a stronger economy for the Chinese-driven New World Order afterdestroying the world’s economy, with their biological warfare, aiming to dominate global affairs with a new tradingnetwork, in a diabolical strategy that will gradually damage U.S. interests worldwide. The stated Chinese objectivesare “to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets, throughcultural exchange and integration, to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations, ending up in aninnovative pattern with capital inflows, talent pool, and technology database.” The problem is, what are weintegrating to, Communism?​ President Trump had been quietly working during his presidency to oppose the whole thing with a programentitled the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy (FOIP), but the Socialist-infested European Union, never jumpedon board, continuing their unconditional support for the Belt and Road Initiative, despite the objections of severalmember-nations, mainly because most European leaders have been corrupted by Chinese money and the U.S has notbeen able to stop them since then, neither with Trump, or “Sleepy Joe” who is a well-known Chinese asset. Goingback to Shiva’s symbolism, Devdutt Pattanaik, an Indian mythologist, wrote an article in Economic Times explainedhow Shiva fits into modern corporate society:Organizations are built by people who have the desire to achieve something. This desire makes themBrahma, the creator of the organization, but when their desire ceases and they let go from the organization andthey become Shiva, the destroyer.[470]​ Having said this, Hinduism is not even one of the five religions recognized by the Chinese government, so itis not known why the statue of a Hindu deity should have been displayed in the first place, at that infamous meetingin January 2019. It is also interesting to note that nuclear research has been associated with Shiva since its inceptionand one of the new obsessions of the New World Order is nuclear power plants, that are said to be of great help intheir supposed “green transition,” but more nuclear power stations in the world could mean more nuclear weapons.After all, the first nuclear power stations were built in many countries primarily to provide fissile material fornuclear weapons during the Cold War. Nuclear materials may also get into the wrong hands and be used to make acrude nuclear device or a so-called “dirty bomb,” but that’s something the elite of the New World Order, and peoplelike Bill Gates in particular, busy building his high-tech nuclear reactors in places like Wyoming, with the help ofthe Japanese, seems to not be worried about.However, the idea that even after the terrible Fukushima disaster, The Japan Atomic EnergyAgency (JAEA), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T) are collaborating with the United States and Bill"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Gates' venture company to build a high-tech nuclear reactor in Wyoming,[471] is something that makes my alarmbells ring and makes me very suspicious as Bill Gates seems to want to achieve God status. After all, J. RobertOppenheimer, known as “the father of the atomic bomb” for his work on bombs dropped on Japan at the end ofWWII, recited a quote referring to Shiva from the Hindu text, the Baghavid-Gita, at the time of the first atom bombtest in 1945 “I become death, the destroyer of worlds,” Oppenheimer said during this historical occasion. DoesBill Gates, who was already heavily involved in the China virus plandemic, as well as the financially backing of thedevelopment of sun-dimming technology that would potentially reflect sunlight out of Earth’s atmosphere,triggering a global cooling effect, want to emulate Shiva? To the rest of the world, China most likely engineered avirulent strain of coronavirus in one of its labs, allowed it to escape and infect the world, and then attempted to coverit up before profiting massively from the resulting pandemic. But not to Bill Gates. For Gates, the communist statedid “great work.”[472]Going back to the photo in question, posted by Dr. Tedros on Twitter on January 16, 2019, rightat the start of the year that will eventually unleash COVID-19 onto the world, the image is even more disturbing ifwe consider the controversial past of Dr. Tedros himself. Tedros’ candidacy for the WHO Director-General was, infact, opposed vigorously by several Ethiopian parties, due to his past career in the Tigray People’s Liberation Front,the most powerful of the armed liberation movements in Ethiopia with decidedly Marxist ideologies, and an abysmalrecord of human rights violations. This means the WHO is now allegedly in the hands of a corrupt and possiblyruthless criminal, aka Dr. Tedros, that sides with China whatever the outcome might be, mainly because of personalinterests and political ideology.​ In his first public message for the year 2022, entitled, “Three resolutions to help achieve Health for All in2022”[473]Dr. Tedros said that his first new year’s resolution (or threat?) for 2022, is to end the pandemic byensuring all governments reach the global target of vaccinating 70% of people in all countries by the middle of2022. Dr. Tedros then added a second resolution aiming for a global sanitary dictatorship, talking about “a strongerglobal framework for global health security” supported by negotiations starting in 2022, that he called a “globalpandemic accord.”This new project, which was already announced officially a month earlier by the United Nations,on December 1, 2021, was described as a “new global accord on pandemic prevention” that is being made to createa new intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) for the New World Order.The decision will establish an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) that will negotiate and draft anyconvention, agreement or, another international instrument. A first meeting will take place no later than 1 March 2022, and public hearings will also be held to informdeliberations. The INB will deliver a progress report to the World Health Assembly in 2023 and submit its outcome forconsideration the following year.​ The third and final resolution announced by Dr. Tedros was that all countries must invest in strongerprimary health care, as the foundation of universal health coverage. However, going back to Tetros’ secondresolution for 2022, we should demand a moratorium on the adoption of this new intergovernmental negotiatingbody (INB). Because the people of the countries represented at the World Health Assembly have never beenproperly informed about the content of the documents being submitted for discussion in March 2022, we shouldreserve the right to oppose the signing of the said pandemic agreement by any legal means and refuse the offer uponits acceptance and ratification. But I’m afraid, that’s no longer possible in the sanitary dictatorship of the New WorldOrder. Satan wants control over us in the End Times and the situation will become increasingly uncomfortable forthose who still believe in God, rather than science.​ On October 15, 2021, Italy brought in the strictest COVID-19 measures in Europe, courtesy of the Orwellianand oppressive Italian Republic, requiring all workers, in both the public and private sectors, to have a vaccinepassport, as the start of what later became an introduction to even more stringent rules and measures, that willgradually unfold in the following months, and eventually bring in the so-called “Super Green Pass” in December2021, and the complete lockdown of the unvaccinated in January 2022, before introducing probably the mandatoryvaccine for the whole Italian population soon. From that infamous date in November 2021, the vaccinepassport introduced in Italy and many other parts of the world, the new rules, are becoming more and morereminiscent of this passage from the Apocalypse of John: So that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark,that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. Revelation 13:17. Of course, violent protests erupted in Rome and other Italian cities over such requirements,but nothing changed, and in the end, the majority of the Italians like many Americans pushed by the Biden"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"administration, went for the vaccine option to avoid being locked up at home, or lose their job, but there issomething profoundly evil going on that goes well beyond the current sanitary dictatorship that is happeningsimultaneously all over the world, and that’s the direct involvement of Satan, the Vatican, and Freemasonry, that I’mexposing in this book.On October 15, 2021, the “Inferno” exhibition conceived by Freemason Jean Claire penname Gérard Régnier, an art historian, art conservator, and a member of the Académie française since May2008, opened at the Scuderie del Quirinale, part of the Quirinale Palace (Italian: Palazzo del Quirinale one of thethree current official residences of the President of the Italian Republic. The exhibition that comprises more than200 artworks from over 80 museums, public collections, and private collections from Italy, the Vatican, and acrossEurope, officially marks not the beginning of Italy’s vaccine passport nightmare, but another importantmilestone, the 700th anniversary of the death of 14th-century writer Dante Alighieri, the creator of Inferno (Italianfor “Hell”) the first part of Dante Alighieri’s 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy, that is followed byPurgatorio (Italian for “Purgatory”), and Paradiso ( “Paradise” or “Heaven”).For this demonic exhibition, that remained open until January 9th, 2022, the choice went tothe first part of his Divine Comedy, and one of the most anticipated pieces of this exhibition was the plaster versionof the monumental 23 foot high “The Gates of Hell,” a sculptural work by French artist Auguste Rodin that wastransported to Rome by the Coubertin Foundry in Paris with a special truck. The operation required an exceptionalorganizational effort at the Scuderie del Quirinale. “The Gates of Hell” which cost Auguste Rodin thirty years ofwork and hosts 186 characters depicts the first section of Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy was there to representanother opening of the gates of hell by the elite.​ During the show’s first weeks, visitors were able to gaze into the “Abyss of Hell” by Botticelli, on loan fromthe Vatican, and there were are also other masterpieces in this demonic exhibition put together by French curatorJean Claire, by such artists as Beato Angelico, Bosch, Bruegel, Goya, Manet, Delacroix, Rodin, Cézanne, Richter,and Kiefer. Of course, the participants to the 2021 G20 Rome summit, which was held in Rome, the capital city ofItaly, before the official opening of the exhibition, between the 30- 31st October 2021, were all given the possibilityof a private glimpse into this unusual exhibition. We all know that the claim the vaccine passports are potentially thestart of the infamous “Mark of the Beast,” has been mocked over and over by the leftist Satanists, and theirmercenaries in the mainstream media, but the reality that is unfolding in front of our eyes every day, tells us a verydifferent story.Do you remember, my dear readers, the arrival of the statue of Moloch at the Colosseum inthe fall of 2019? The plandemic was already spreading from Wuhan to the rest of the planet, and the elite wasalready covertly announcing it with this powerful symbol. I even talked in Vol.4, which was published back inDecember 2019, about the possible dangers that the image of this infamous deity, placed in the Colosseum, mighttrigger, and the concerns of many Christians[474], regarding what might happen to Italy and the rest of the world, ifthey didn’t remove it immediately. Of course, I was right once again in my assertion, as God’s wrath was already onits way with the China virus. Having said that, one of the strangest statues that I have ever seen in my entire life wasset up right outside U.N. Headquarters in New York City in November 2021 but was later removed, on December20, 2021, after a growing number of Christian believers started to get offended by this monstrosity placed outside ofthe U.N.'s Visitors Plaza.​ However, CBN News reported on the 5th of January 2022, that,A statue displayed at the United Nations in New York, which was likened to the end-times \"beast\" from theNew Testament's book of Revelation, has been removed.[475]​ Adding an improbable excuse by a U.N. representative:Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the Secretary-General, told CBN News the sculpture was notpermanent and its removal was planned. \"The statue you refer to was a temporary exhibit organized by thePermanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations. It was taken down, as scheduled and anticipated, on 20December,\" Dujarric said in a statement on Wednesday.[476]​ Say “its removal was planned,” sounds like a lame excuse, but that’s the U.N. after all, the home of the NewWorld Order and constant lies. When I first heard about it, I could hardly believe that the global elite would be sobrazen in showing their true colors, and so I looked into this very carefully, and unfortunately, this is not just a badrumor but another Ahrimanic representation of the Lord of Darkness and Chaos, placed right in front of the controlroom of the New World Order. This gigantic statue called “The Guardian of International Peace and Security”"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"looks like something out of a science fiction movie. It does not resemble any known creature on this planet. Instead,it appears to closely resemble the old Persian representation of Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), but also the “beast” that isdescribed in the Book of Revelation. If you have not seen it yet, you can find video footage of this “beast” online onvarious Youtube channels.[477]​ Did they think that they could put this up without anyone noticing? Of course not! But they don’t careanymore, just like they have not cared when they did that Satanic ceremony at the inauguration of the tunnel inSwitzerland, when they did the ritual in front of CERN, when they placed Moloch in the Colosseum, or broughtRodin’s 23-foot high “The Gates of Hell,” to Rome to officially kickstart the “Mark of the Beast” project. We needto prepare, it is no longer the time to think about the possibility of the End Times happening in our lifetime, butrather be ready for it and act accordingly. The home of the New World Order, the United Nations, unveiling a statue of a strange-lookingbeast outside its headquarters in New York City, just in time for the Apocalypse, says it all, so stop thinking aboutgoing back to normality, because these are not normal times that we are living, but unprecedented ones that willchange forever the whole of mankind. The statue in question is more than bizarre and resembles the beast from theBook of Revelation, but there is also another indication this is a Satanic work of art commissioned by the evilIlluminati in time for their end game. The name “The Guardian of International Peace and Security” seems toindicate the ominous warning present in Thessalonians 5:3. While people are saying, “There is peace andsecurity ” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, andthey will not escape.​ The End times are upon us let us pray, but also let’s be ready as the gates of hell are now wide open for thosewho ignore these warnings, and the Great Reject is our only hope so that we can finally stand by the side of Godwhen he sends once again his Only Begotten Son because, From His Father, He inherited divine powers (seeJohn 10:17–18).Without hate or passion, in a tranquil and relaxed manner, please empty your head of all the religious, scientific,intellectual, and political dogmas and rubbish, the elite, and their system has been pushing on us for so long, so wecan move forward towards a new dawn ready to face the great battles in front of us in the name of our Lord JesusChrist.Apocalypse is unfolding in front of our eyes, and you'll need to be bold and courageous. You see, thesecond coming (“end times”) should not have any frightening thoughts as the New Testament writers, or earlyChristians, always longed for the return of Jesus, and, of course, if you have read Revelation 20-22 in the end, Godwins, and those who have not worshiped the beast or its image, and have not received the infamous mark on theirforeheads or their hands, will be able to partake in the Kingdom of God. For the first Christians, they hoped to seethis happen in their lifetimes, but it didn’t because it is happening in ours, which includes the increasing persecutionof Christians.Christianity Today reported last year that “Every day, 13 Christians worldwide are killed because of theirfaith. Every day, 12 churches or Christian buildings are attacked. And every day, 12 Christians are unjustly arrestedor imprisoned, and another 5 are abducted.” Is the Pope aka the False Prophet Jorge Mario Bergoglio doingsomething about it? Of course not, the Jesuit False Prophet is too busy promoting the vaccines.​ In early January 2022, Pope Francis has once again strongly pushed for people to take the abortion-taintedCOVID-19 injections, calling health care and vaccination “a moral obligation,” both for personal health and thehealth of others, while continuing to ignore both moral concerns,[478]as well as health concerns. In the meantime,according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom's 2020 report, Christians are beingpersecuted more than ever in many foreign countries, including Communist China, and various Muslim ones. Thetruth is, that since the beginning of this never-ending sanitary emergency/plandemic, traditional Christians, as wellas large portions of the Orthodox Jewish community, who have not given up their religious identity and their lovefor God in the name of progressive values, science, and the infamous “vaccine god,” have been more and moreisolated, and persecuted all over the world, even in countries like the U.S., or in Europe.​ Churches and other places of worship have been closing for long periods because of the never-endingrestrictions and lockdowns imposed for the China virus pandemic, and in many countries, the police even interveneddirectly to forcefully shut down masses. In April 2020, an Italian Catholic priest, for example, refused to complywith a request to end the mass in front of the shocked faithful, resulting in a 280 euro fine,[479] while in the sameperiod the police shut down a Sunday church service in Baltimore to the disbelieve of the pastor who said they wereviolating the U.S Constitution.[480]One year later, in April 2021, the situation, got even worse. A Roman Catholic church in Londoncomplained to the police after their officers brutally shut down a Good Friday service, on the grounds it brokeCOVID-19 lockdown rules.[481] While pastor Sharon Perry, of the Abundant Grace Christian Assembly in Ringsend,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Dublin, Ireland, was given a prosecution notice and threatened with up to six months in prison by the national policeforce for opening her church on Easter Sunday.[482]Similar actions took place in so many different countries, including Australia, of course, it is impossible toreport them all. In early January 2022, Artur Pawlowski, the pastor of Street Church and the Cave of Adullam inCalgary, Alberta, Canada, who made some videos documenting his multiple contentious exchanges with local lawenforcement officials during the plandemic, was arrested along with his brother Dawid after protesting outside thehome of Alberta Health Minister Jason Copping. In the moments leading up to the arrest, Pawlowski, a Polishimmigrant to Canada, referred to his adopted country as “Chinada,” seeking to compare the actions of governmentofficials to those taken by the Chinese Communist Party.[483] This view coincides with the previously cited homily,of the great Serbian Orthodox Bishop Photius of the Eparchy of Zvornik and Tuzla, who said “Until now, peoplehave been struggling each in their own place of living, in their own region, in their own country, but today [it] isnecessary to struggle globally for global freedom because if they close everything, and if they place us in thosedigital camps, nobody will be able to go to anybody.” [484] ​ The bishop’s homily was posted to Twitter on December 14, 2021[485] but resurfaced strongly with Serbia’sfavorite son, tennis great Novak Djokovic, who fought to be allowed to defend his title in Australia. Photiushighlighted the spiritual nature of humanity’s struggle against COVID passports and said that they are part of a newChinese-style digital communism. He warned that vaccine passport implementation is a “trap” to ensnare humanitywhile granting privileges to benefit only “the chosen ones,” “the obedient,” and “‘the ‘rulers of this world.’” Photiuswarned, “They will lock us up into ghettos. They will lock us up into digital prisons,” adding that, “Someone may beimprisoned in one’s apartment, not being allowed to move from one room to another, and this may be declared thebest solution.”[486] The bishop stated that it is time for the Christian Church to become resolute and resist vaccinepassports by engaging in prayer and fasting, and for everyone to respond however they can.All this is symptomatic of the growing persecution of Christians even in the “civilized” Western World, where agrowing number of Churches and synagogues are being burned and vandalized each day, courtesy of the Leftist andIslamic mercenaries of the New World Order.

Penned by John the Apostle, who allegedly at the age of 86, wrote the last book of theBible, the revelation of Jesus Christ. Revelation contains the final chapters of the New Testament and is dedicated toprophetic visions outlining the final days of mankind before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Revelation speaksof natural cataclysms and plagues that will follow the arrival of the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse among them thesecond horse is the red horse of war, described in Revelation 6:4, “Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it wasgranted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another, andthere was given to him a great sword.”​ The red horse, that in my view is Russia, or China, or both combined, after all, the term “Red scare” belongsto both, as the first “Red Scare” was used following the Bolshevik Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequentwave of Communist revolutions throughout Europe and beyond, and according to The New York Times in 2019,China's growing military and economic power have resulted in a “New Red Scare” in the United States. Considerthat Henry Kissinger, in his book World Order, wrote that when in the 1950s and 1960s “the prevailing strategicdoctrine of each superpower relied on the ability to inflict an ‘unacceptable’ level of damage on the presumedadversary,”[487] the answer of the founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC), was a shocking one thatshould make us all extremely worried today. “Mao spoke of China’s willingness to accept sacrifices of hundreds ofmillions in a nuclear war.”[488] Kissinger also adds that such statement, “was widely treated in the West as asymptom of emotional or ideological derangement.”[489] But, “It was, in fact, probably the consequence of a sobercalculation that to withstand military capacities beyond previous human experience, a country needs to demonstrate"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"the willingness to sacrifice beyond human comprehension.”[490]​ The “fiery red” horse will bring death all over this planet at an unprecedented level in which ¼ of the humanpopulation will be slaughtered, and with the possibility of a global nuclear war, that number might be even bigger,remember that Albert Einstein predicted that in a full-scale nuclear exchange, 1/3 of the earth’s population wouldprobably die. That is roughly 110 million people in America today. Think that’s an exaggeration? There are roughly14,000 nuclear weapons in the world and 90% of them are in the hands of Russia and the US, according toatmospheric scientist and nuclear expert Professor Brian Toon, which seems to ignore China is also expanding itsnuclear arsenal. However, even if the smallest weapon in the U.S. arsenal (100 kilotons), or a similar one isunleashed on the United States by Russia or China, it would cause catastrophic devastation if it was detonated over amajor city. Everything in a six-mile diameter would catch on fire and be destroyed. Professor Brian Toon says, “Ifyou get within a mile or so [of the blast], the pressure wave is so intense, it will blow down concrete buildings. Andsomewhere in that zone, there's a blast of radiation from the bomb... half of the people exposed to that would dieover a week or two from radiation burns on their skin and radiation poisoning.” On top of this don’t forget Putin’supcoming 16,000mph “Satan-2” nuke with 12 warheads, a very appropriate name for a monster weapon that coulddestroy an entire country.​ For Claire Reilly, who worked on CNET's recent documentary series Hacking the Apocalypse, “If yousurvive the initial impact, your troubles are far from over. These kinds of nuclear blasts generate city-wide fires thatwould push smoke into the stratosphere, blocking out the sun for 10 years and sending temperatures back to whatEarth experienced during the last ice age.”[491] Of course, “you can't duck and cover from a giant asteroid impact oralien invasion.” But in case of a nuclear war scenario, or let’s say a medium-sized asteroid, or not-so-smart group ofalien invaders, we will be able to survive if we are ready. However, Reilly warns us that:The only way you survive in the immediate vicinity is to head underground. If you're used to the finer thingsin life you might head to a place like the Survival Condo in rural Kansas, which offers luxury apartments andfeatures like a cinema, swimming pool, and climbing wall, all 15 stories underground -- for $1 million a pop. Ifthat's not your vibe and you're further away from the impact zone, you could wait out Nuclear Winter in aprepping community, like Fortitude Ranch in West Virginia. It won't protect you from a direct blast, but it'sideal if you're looking for strength in numbers to survive the long, cold years of a post-apocalyptic winter withno food. And its rural location places it far away from city-dwelling marauding hordes.[492]​ Aside from always having massive doses of KI (potassium iodide), a salt of stable (not radioactive) iodinethat can help block radioactive iodine from being absorbed by the thyroid gland, you can see how the survivalexperts seem to think that in order survive for a longer period, one of the key factors is indeed the “strength innumbers” of a large group of people, but you also need like-minded individuals to survive even longer, to possiblyestablish the foundations of a new society. This subject was briefly exposed in the star-studded satire “Don’t LookUp,” which some critics called the movie of the year, that made its 2021 Christmas Eve debut on the leftistpropaganda platform Netflix. Unfortunately, the libtards linked it immediately to climate change, the currentobsession of the leftist predators, and the possibility that a real asteroid, or comet, may sooner or later hit our planet,was at that point completely left out. “A film about a comet hurtling towards Earth and no one is doing anythingabout it? Sounds like the climate crisis” said Peter Kalmus, a deranged climate scientist and author of Being theChange: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution to The Guardian[493]. But aside from the obvious anti-Trumpreferences of the movie, with a conservative president played by leftist darling Meryl Streep, and the U.S. patriotsmade to look like a bunch of fools who don’t look up and accept the imminent disaster because they don’t want toaccept what is happening, there are some truths in this film. In November of 2021, an unusual spacecraft waslaunched by NASA on a mission to test technology that could one day tip a dangerous asteroid off course. Officially,Nasa's Dart mission wants to see how difficult it would be to stop a sizeable space rock from hitting Earth.[494]Some say they fear the arrival of 99942 Apophis. After its discovery in 2004, asteroid 99942Apophis had been identified as one of the most hazardous asteroids that could impact Earth in the future, and even ifastronomers have concluded that there is no risk for the time being, after the uncertainty in the 2029 approachdistance has been reduced from hundreds of kilometers, to now just a couple of kilometers,[495] this asteroid mightstill bring us some dark energies from the cosmos. Comets and asteroids have been considered bad omens, sinceancient times, until approximately the 16th century.​ These omens would include crop failures, diseases, deaths of royalty, or other such catastrophic events. Plinythe Elder (23-79 AD), a Roman natural philosopher, thought comets were the cause of political issues and death.[496]The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition, as in, what they are made of. Asteroids aremade up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust, and rocky material. Both asteroids and"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"comets were formed early in the history of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago.[497] When they saw a cometor an asteroid in the sky, the ancients were stricken with fear. A ball of fire, with a tail stretching across the sky,obviously not a good omen. The skies were the home of capricious gods and such a disturbance in the heavensmeant danger on earth. In 1066, a comet was seen as William the Conqueror was preparing to invade England. Soonafter, Harold, the Saxon king, was defeated by William, and old heads nodded. It was only to be expected after sucha portent.[498] Through their roles as harbingers of doom are now discounted by most people, they are stillconsidered relevant by the Jesuits and the Illuminati that wants to unleash Cyber Satan on the world for theimplementation of the Great Reset by 2030.​ On Friday, April 13, 2029, Earth will experience a dramatic close encounter with the asteroid 99942Apophis. The 1,120 feet (340-meter) wide object could even hit us, or pass within just 19,000 miles (31,000 km) ofour home planet, a distance that brings it closer than most geostationary satellites that could also be damaged by itspassage. Thanks to the tremendous size of Apophis, even if it’s only a close-passage, it will be so bright that around2 billion people will be able to witness it with the naked eye, probably as one of the scariest moments in their lives.First becoming visible in the southern hemisphere, the asteroid will appear as a bright star streaking across the skyfrom east to west, initially passing over Australia, then the Indian Ocean, and eventually crossing the equator overAfrica. Remember, “Apophis” is the ancient Greek name for an ancient Egyptian deity called “Apep”—also spelled“Apepi” or “Aapep”—who was seen as the embodiment of chaos and the opponent of light and order in thecosmos. This should concern us as we are entering the darkest of ages as we approach the 2030 AI take over. Forthose who will survive the coming years, and hopefully view the passage of Apophis, this will be another epicmoment of this ongoing Apocalypse, but whatever happens, don’t give in to fear as we already have enough of thatgoing around.​ For a while now, it’s been rather clear that the primary objective of most pandemic coverage, in the age ofCOVID, is to scare the socks off mass audiences, nothing more, it’s all presented as terrifying, another sign of theimpending Apocalypse, but if you have Jesus in your hearts, you should never be afraid, because that’s what thesedemons, archons, voladores, alien parasites, call them whatever you want; who control also the media, truly wantfrom you. They feed off your sadness, fear, anger, and irritation, as well as other negative, harmful, toxic, sinfulemotions, and their corresponding thought behaviors. Don’t be afraid of such feelings in the coming years, as Godwill always help if you ask him to protect you with a sincere heart, especially after 2030 when Cyber Satan is set totake over the show and the Great Reset is completed.​ For Victor Shvets, a renewed global business strategist who originally left the Soviet Union in 1979 becausehe saw greater opportunities in the West and its finance industry, but is now back to be a Socialist, who predicts theend of Capitalism, in his book The Great Rupture: Three Empires, Four Turning Points, and the Future ofHumanity, we will face by 2030 artificial intelligence (AI) “will replace most research functions and go beyond thatby anticipating changes and making discoveries.” AI in his demented Socialist vision will be able to make all thosenaughty decisions entrepreneurs struggle to make now, ending Capitalism as we know it. Shvets writes, “modern AIcan manipulate an unheard amount of information, and hence, arguably it might steer investments in a moreproductive way than has ever been possible by Adam Smith’s invisible hand.” Shvets even believes that Bolshevikrevolutionary Nikolai Bukharin’s scientific planning of state control “might not have been wrong at all but were justa century ahead of their time.​ Today, the computational power might allow for such planning to occur without creating the stagnation andinefficiency of the Soviet system.” He goes on to say F.A. Hayek’s ideas may end up on the scrap heap of historyand free-market Capitalism will be viewed as the same as the “burning of witches.” All of this after most of his bookis spent chronicling how freedom is the reason the West has prospered and the Ottoman Empire, China, and Russiahave been mired in poverty. However, now, Americans are sitting around watching TV and playing on theircomputers instead of reading. Shvets says the collision of financialization and technology has led to civildisintegration, “all the ingredients of Roman ‘bread and circuses.’ Escapism, stagnating incomes, and risinginequalities characterize most Western societies, with the public sector stepping in to distribute ‘Free bread.’”Younger people are more in favor than their parents of government solving problems. Baby boomer parents havecreated kids who are dependent, used to winning “prizes for losers.”​ Shvets believes this era is more toxic than smoking, with loneliness, increased suicides, declining literacy,digital addictions, and impaired analytical capacity. The new “Socialist paradise” on the horizon, according toShvets, will be fair, equitable, and beneficial to society, rather than the freedom and individualism, that we allappreciate in most parts of the world. His soothsaying is based on a quarter of millennials believing democracy isbad for society, and unfortunately less than a third believing it essential. These days fewer than half of Europeanmillennials support democracy despite direct experience with both Fascism and Communism that created so muchdeath and destruction."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"​ Shvets sees a world where AI takes over and only 5 percent of people will work and the remaining 95 percentwon’t have to, presumably supported by taxes paid by the 5 percent. “Karl Marx’s idea of ‘communism’ will be ourcommon future,” Shvets writes. Society will achieve such a high level of productivity “it will liberate humans fromthe need to toil to survive, and by that stage, it is likely, that alternative avenues of personal satisfaction will alsoemerge.” But like Douglas French President Emeritus of the Mises Institute, and author of books like EarlySpeculative Bubbles & Increases in the Money Supply and Walk Away: The Rise and Fall of the Home-OwnershipMyth, wrote in response to Shvets Socialist propaganda: “there can be no such thing as a leisurely form ofCommunism,” adding Mr. Shvets, “there is mature capitalism. And, it’s not Communism, Marxian orotherwise.”[499] Unfortunately, the New World Order seems to think otherwise and loves to promote the work ofpeople like Victor Shvets, who should have probably stayed in that nightmare called the Soviet Union to enjoy thelast years of what used to be a Communist hell hole. I hope, however, that by 2030, those who agree to join theGreat Reject, will be enough to form a different kind of society that is in no way connected to Shvets vision, that is,of course, also Satan’s vision.​ Christians across the world are experiencing increasing hardship, targeting, and persecution because of thestand they take for biblical principles, as the Satanic principles of the Marxist New World Order take over the show,in this context, democratic backsliding, also known as autocratization, democratic decay and de-democratization onthe rise worldwide. The libtards and the elite that controls them would like you to think that democratic backslidingis happening in countries like America because of conservative leaders like Donald J. Trump. The InternationalInstitute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance for this reason, recently added the United States to their list ofbacksliding democracies, pointing to Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as statevoting laws that disproportionately impact minority groups.[500] But these institutions, which should check oncountries losing their democratic qualities, conveniently leave out countries under Jesuit/Sabbattean Masonic controllike Germany, Austria, Italy, Australia, or Canada, politicizing such research for their own sick goals. No wonder,influential leftist “political scientists” like Pippa Norris, of the Harvard Kennedy School and the University ofSydney, in Australia, argue that the two “twin forces” that pose the largest threat to Western liberal democracies are“sporadic and random terrorist attacks on domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and the rise of populist-authoritarian forces, which feed parasitically upon these fears.”[501]​ Now, we all know that the left has helped with their insane immigration policies, false flag operations, therise of terrorism in most of the West, but when you react to these insane policies and manipulations, you are nowcalled a “populist-authoritarian,” who wants to participate in democratic backsliding. The truth is that the verypeople who seem to be obsessing with the future of democracy, like Joe Biden, are unfortunately the very samepeople, who are doing everything to sabotage it, as they help, willingly or unwillingly, the rise of China, as thewinning model for the age of Artificial Intelligence and robotics. An internet pioneer and technology developer andadministrator predicted, “My expectation is that by 2030, as much of 75% of the world’s population will be enslavedby artificial intelligence-based surveillance systems developed in China and exported around the world. Thesesystems will keep every citizen under observation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, monitoring their everyaction.”​ Dan Gillmor, co-founder of the News Co/Lab at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School ofJournalism and Mass Communication, and professor of practice in digital media literacy commented, “Governments(and their corporate partners) are broadly using technology to create a surveillance state, and what amounts to lawby unaccountable black-box algorithm, far beyond anything Orwell imagined. But this can only happen in a societythat can’t be bothered to protect liberty – or is easily led/stampeded into relinquishing it – and that is happeningmore and more in the Western democracies. The re-emergence of public bigotry has nothing to do with technology,except to the extent that bigots use it to promote their malignant goals. Meanwhile, the institutions that are supposedto protect liberty – journalism among them – are mostly failing to do so. In a tiny number of jurisdictions, peoplehave persuaded leaders to push back on the encroachments, such as a partial ban on government use of facialrecognition in San Francisco. But the encroachments are overwhelming and accelerating.”​ Leah Lievrouw, Professor of Information Studies at the University of California-Los Angeles, wrote, “Todate, virtually no democratic state or system has sorted out how to deal with this challenge to the fundamentallegitimacy of democratic processes, and I guess that only a deep and destabilizing crisis (perhaps growing out of therise of authoritarian, ethnic or cultural nationalism) will prompt a serious response.”[502]​ Democracy in America seems to have faced its most serious crisis in decades, in November 2020, as its basictenets, including a guarantee of free and fair elections, seemed to have been temporarily abandoned in the U.S.A.after one of the most controversial presidential elections in American history, saw in the end, the victory of “SleepyJoe, “and this might be only beginning of a disturbing trend. Only a few months earlier, in June 2020, a newinstitution called the Academy’s Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship, celebrated the release"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"of its final report titled: Our Common Purpose: Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st Century. Thequestion is, why do all these influential people suddenly need to meet up to reinvent democracy? Well, the answer issimple: to sabotage it! For this reason, nearly 1,200 people viewed the launch of this extraordinary libtard event,which featured Commission Chairs Danielle Allen (Harvard University), Stephen Heintz (Rockefeller Brothers Fundthe Philanthropic Foundation created and run by members of the Rockefeller family), and Eric Liu (founder andCEO of Citizen University who served President Bill Clinton as Deputy Assistant for Domestic Policy in the years1999 and 2000); Academy President David Oxtoby; as well as Commission members Judy Woodruff (PBSNewsHour) and David Brooks (The New York Times).[503]​ During this event, the mercenaries of the New World Order proposed thirty-one recommendations, groupedby six strategic imperatives, to officially help the nation emerge as a more resilient constitutional democracy by2026, its 250th anniversary, an important symbolic event, that the New World Order wants to use, to eliminatedemocracy in the United States. The Commission founded in 2018 “to reinvent American democracy,” said to bemade up of a diverse, bipartisan cohort of scholars, business leaders, media members, elected officials, andphilanthropists,[504]was established in the U.S., by the Jesuit/Sabbatean elite, with the official goal of exploring howbest to respond to the vulnerabilities in our political and civic life, but it is working behind the scenes to make surethe world’s oldest constitutional democracy becomes a rigged antidemocratic system, that will never again be in thehands of a populist president like Mr. Trump, or anybody else, that can oppose their evil plan of ushering in aSocialist technocracy in the United States. However, the need to “reinvent democracy,” is an obsession not only inAmerica these days. In an article, that is part of a BBC Future series about the long view of humanity, publishedin March 2019, public philosopher Roman Krznaric, argued that for democracy:One problem is the electoral cycle, an inherent design flaw of democratic systems that produce shortpolitical time horizons. Politicians might offer enticing tax breaks to woo voters at the next electoral contest,while ignoring long-term issues out of which they can make little immediate political capital, such as dealingwith ecological breakdown, pension reform, or investing in early childhood education. Back in the 1970s, thisform of myopic policy-making was dubbed the “political business cycle.”[505]​ That’s why the leftist elite wants to substitute democratic systems, with their technocratic “Socialist paradise”ruled by the AI. For this reason, as Lee Edwards pointed out, “radical progressives are trying to convinceAmericans, especially young Americans, that Socialism is the solution to America’s socio-economicproblems. They are banking on millennial ignorance of the repeated failures of socialism and the proven ability of afree enterprise to produce opportunity and prosperity for the greatest number.” "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"FIG. 48 –– A rare Masonic document from the 1770s shows how the Green Dragon Tavern located on Union Street (then known as Green DragonLane) in Boston's North End, was used by the Freemasons to plan the Boston Tea Party precursor to the American Revolution.The Illuminati Fear the Kingdom of God So how did we produce the American miracle in the first place back in 1776? Well, while monarchies dominatedeighteenth-century Europe, American revolutionaries were determined to find an alternative to this method ofgovernment. Radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine, whose enormously popular essay Common Sense was firstpublished in January 1776, advocated a republic: a state without a king. Six months later, Jefferson’s Declaration ofIndependence affirmed the break with England but did not suggest what form of government should replacemonarchy, the only system most English colonists had ever known. In the late eighteenth century, republics werefew and far between. Genoa, Venice, and the Dutch Republic provided examples of states without monarchs, but"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"many European Enlightenment thinkers questioned the stability of a republic. Nonetheless, after their break fromGreat Britain, Americans turned to Republicanism for their new government.[506]This system has worked ever since, but will it withstand the competition of ruthlessauthoritarian models like the one in China, or Russia in the new millennium? The answer is no, and even if this willmake you mad, or at least upset, we need to face reality and prepare for what’s coming next if our model fails. InMarch 2021, China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, got uncomfortably close to the truth when he lectured Americanofficials during their summit in Alaska about creating turmoil by invading other countries and having a “Cold Warmentality” by trying to impose its democracy on the world. Of course, Yang would not admit to China's appallinghuman rights record, crushing of dissent, or flouting international rules and claiming disputed territory, but hesincerely didn’t care about America’s response, as in the eyes of Communist China democracy it is simply an oldoutdated system with no future in the new era of Artificial Intelligence. When Yang Jiechi sat down with hisAmerican counterparts in Alaska, he also made it clear that there is another big voice in the world — and theAmerican-led so-called “global liberal order” does not run the game anymore. After all, they want to be the main AIleaders by 2030.​ But perhaps his most telling comment, though, was that far from being a model of democracy, “many peoplein the United States have little confidence” in their own government. America —and by extension, the West — isgoing through a period of soul searching where it appears exhausted, unsure of itself, and hypocritical.[507] At thispoint, many of you will ask me, what can we do to save our way of life, and our beloved country, from this mess?The Illuminati agents, and their Jesuit supervisors in the U.S., are trying to transform America into a Socialistnightmare, ready to join China, and the rest of the world in their AI Socialist take over. For this reason, we need torealize, as soon as possible, that the weak spots of our democratic system are being exploited every day beyondrecovery by our enemies, that by corrupting our politicians, and the lobbyists that fund them, are already infringingon our Constitutional rights, more and more each day until we will no longer have a republic. Because America is arepublic, and not a pure democracy, the contemporary efforts to weaken our republican customs and institutions inthe name of greater equality will only make us weak prey of the Chinese-driven New World Order. Something theJesuits and their Illuminati agents planned for a very long time. The Demoncrats, and their controllers, want tosabotage the careful balance produced by our mixed republic in the U.S., to advance their Socialist agenda more andmore, and undermine our political liberty, sabotaging forever our unique way of life based on Liberty and Justice forAll, and the American dream. Sadly, there is little, or nothing, that we can do to stop them if we don’t properlyunderstand the secrets of our Founding Fathers that put together 1776 as a project that will last only until the returnof Christ. Yes, the parousia meaning “arrival, “coming”, or “presence” in Greek, is the expiry date of ourconstitutional federal republic. A “republic” is a form of government in which the people hold power, but electrepresentatives to exercise that power, but that’s not, of course, a valid system once you have Christ the King asyour ruler.Most Christian denominations consider the kingly office of Christ to be one of the threefoldoffices: Christ is a prophet, priest, and king.[508] In the end, the only possibility we have, to fight the advancement ofthe infamous China model, is to defend our republic, while we also learn the principles of monarchy, preservingthem in some way for the Second Coming. In other parts of the world outside the United States, where democracy isnow a growing farse, like in the European Union, for example, monarchy is the only system that could, in theory,withhold the advance of Cyber Satan’s Legion in the End times, saving us from this technocratic Socialistnightmare even here in the United States, if eventually the Republic for Which We Stand, fails to resist theadvancing Socialist nightmare, promoted by an increasing number of today’s corrupt politicians in Washington D.C.After the Capitol Hill trap, most people in America are rightly disillusioned with politics, not willing to sacrificetheir lives to fight the rise of Communism and, what is becoming a social menace.​ However, when I say the word monarchy, please don’t misunderstand me, I’m not talking about the Britishmonarchy or most of the corrupt monarchies around in today’s world. After all, back in the days of AdamWeishaupt’s Illuminati, in their INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE REGENT DEGREE, it states: “the mostpowerful monarchs are ruled by the Illuminati.”[509]That’s why they are probably still in power if your country iscurrently a monarchy, and the recent scandals can only confirm that, as well as the demented leftist attitude of aBritish import, and libtard, Prince Harry, or the deviant and perverted ways of his uncle, former “Prince” Andrew,now exposed as a pedophile connected to the Sabbatean-Frankist mafia. In the Illuminati system, there are specificlessons in the upper degrees that openly suggest revolutions towards those monarchs who are not forced intosubmission by employing all the “peaceful” ways of Jesuitical Machiavellism. There are also lessons for the lowerdegrees that say the order will bring change slowly, and without violence, to deceive those who joined.What are we to do then? Promote revolutions? Turn everything upside down? Expel violence with violence?"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Exchange one tyrant for another? Certainly not! Any violent reform is reprehensible because it does notimprove things as long as men with their passions remain unchanged, and because wisdom does not need to becoerced.[510]​ Consequently, those who ignore the truth regarding the lessons of the higher degrees, believe these passagesare conclusive of the Illuminati goals, but that’s not thecase. Over time, only a few other high-ranking Illuminati were let into the true purpose of the Order, while mostof the members were left in the dark about their true intentions, believing naively it was never the BavarianIlluminati’s original goal to hire thugs to violently overthrow a state. Also, the fact that there was no formalceremony to go along with the higher degrees, and the mounting problems the Order was facing after they wereexposed in the middle of the 1780s, eventually ensured that the teachings of the high degrees truly remained theexclusive knowledge they had always been designed to be,[511]for a very limited amount of people, just as it istoday. However, private correspondence between the high degrees of the Illuminati in those days shows how theylaughed between themselves, on how these early lessons, were cleverly designed to give that very misimpression tothe lower degrees in both matters of politics, as well as religion. As I mentioned at the very start of this book, thefinal and highest degree of the Illuminati system had the working title “Rex”, but as specified in The Secret Schoolof Wisdom: The Authentic Rituals and Doctrines of the Illuminati,...the only two manuscripts extant (one being a mere copy of the other) carry the headline ‘PhilosophySages’ instead. Indeed, it might be called the degree of the philosopher-king. There is not much that constitutesa link to the preceding lecture, except for the invitation to the candidate to find a vantage- point from which tosee the world from a new perspective.[512]​ That “new perspective,” for those joining the elite of the Illuminati, was and still is, of course, Communism,the true virus of our age. An idea that makes me draw a rather fitting analogy, as Adam’s Weishaupt’s IlluminatiOrder became the Wuhan lab of the future Communist ideology, where it was elaborated and perfectioned to lethallevels by some of its most distinguished members, including the utopian Socialist Philippe Buonarroti (1761-1837), who will then influence Sabbatean-Frankist Karl Marx(1818-1883), who will later influence MaoZedong(1893-1976), the founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC), whose form of Communism,loyal to the original plan of the Illuminati and its Jesuit supervisors, will give us the infamous China virus. As youcan see, everything is connected in this insane world, and without Weishaupt’s diabolical creature, we would haveprobably lived in a very different world today, where all monarchies of any importance are dead, and what weperceive as democracy still reigns, but for how long?Since 1850, most of the property-based injustices have been lifted and the world as it existedbefore the French and American Revolution is only a historical memory, but where are we heading today, if nottowards the abyss of uncertainty and despair thanks to our ignorance. Cicero once said: “Not to know that happenedbefore one was born is always to remain the child,” and for the very same reason I’m here, at times, boring you withthese historical facts.​ Going back to the candidate for the Rex Degree or Philosopher King, that was given to NapoleonBonaparte, such a degree in the early days of the Illuminati had to be found in those people particularly discontentedwith the usual civil institutions, so they could serve better the secret revolutionary project of the Order. A seeminglyrhetorical question I showed you earlier in the PREPARATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE TO PARTICIPATE INGOVERNING THE ORDER OF THE ILLUMINATI, regarding “the greatest monarchs of the world” who would be“rendered incapable of doing evil,” shows the real intentions of Weishaupt’s Communist plan from the very start. Acandidate to the inner circle ruling the order, was thus first invited to explore the possibility of the conquest ofgovernments by infiltration, stating that nations must be brought to embrace their plan by “whatever means areconducible—peaceably if it can be done; but if not, then by force—for all subordination must vanish from the faceof the earth,”[513]and this is the mission of World Economic Forum’s founder Klaus Schwab, a former member ofthe steering committee of the Bilderberg Group, co-founded by SS member Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, anda typical example of a German Illuminati member, who has always followed from the beginning of his career, AdamWeishaupt’s original instructions, and philosophy, to become the ideal Rex, a Philosopher King, that can help withhis actions, the rise of the Antichrist, and the not so “Great” King Set/Satan.​ You could only understand this better, if you had access to the instruction of the higher degrees the Illuminati,where they finally reveal their Machiavellian tactics for a violent revolution (if needed), to establish, in the end, anatheist godless Communist world. However, to do it without being erased, and sabotaged, the Illuminati learned"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"from the very beginning to cloak themselves in a false portrait of the message of Jesus, and Klaus Schwab, a typicalhigh-level Illuminati, also does that regularly, growing in influence and popularity among the elite every day.Schwab even admitted that the World Economic Forum can steer the global agenda because it has successfullyinfiltrated the cabinets of several world governments, a sinister modality directly coming out of Adam Weishaupt’splaybook. Speaking to political commentator and Bohemian Club member David Gergen, in 2017, at the HarvardKennedy School’s Institute of Politics, Klaus Schwab described how the WEF’s modus operandi is to “penetratecabinets” and governments by installing its “young global leaders,” that in the past have included “Mrs. Merkel, andeven Vladimir Putin,” who Schwab confirms “have all been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.”[514] FIG. 49 –– Illuminati and Freemason Philippe Buonarroti (1761-1837) proposed a mutualist strategy that would revolutionize society by stages,starting from monarchy to liberalism, then to radicalism, and finally to Communism.The Marxist Pact of the Catacombs to Sabotage the Kingdom of God Professor Klaus Schwab invited Pope Francis to speak at Davos in January 2014, just after he was madepope, displaying that he knew already back then, how they both shared the same Communist ideology, originallyinspired by a mysterious Marxist pact signed by 42 bishops of the Catholic Church in the Catacombs of Rome onNovember 16, 1965.Message Of His Holiness Pope Francis To Prof. Klaus SchwabMessage of His Holiness Pope Francis to Prof. Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of theWorld Economic Forum Davos-Klosters (Switzerland), January 22-25, 2014."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"By Holy See MissionMessage of His Holiness Pope Francis to Prof. Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the WorldEconomic Forum Davos-Klosters (Switzerland), January 22-25, 2014. To Professor Klaus Schwab, ExecutiveChairman of the World Economic Forum,​ I am very grateful for your kind invitation to address the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum,which, as is customary, will be held at Davos-Klosters at the end of this month. Trusting that the meeting willprovide an occasion for deeper reflection on the causes of the economic crisis affecting the world these pastfew years, I would like to offer some considerations in the hope that they might enrich the discussions of theForum and make a useful contribution to its important work. Ours is a time of notable changes and significantprogress in different areas which have important consequences for the life of humanity. In fact, “we mustpraise the steps being taken to improve people’s welfare in areas such as health care, education, andcommunications” (Evangelii Gaudium, 52), in addition to many other areas of human activity, and we mustrecognize the fundamental role that modern business activity has had in bringing about these changes, bystimulating and developing the immense resources of human intelligence. Nonetheless, the successes whichhave been achieved, even if they have reduced poverty for a great number of people, often have led towidespread social exclusion. Indeed, the majority of the men and women of our time continue to experiencedaily insecurity, often with dramatic consequences. In the context of your meeting, I wish to emphasize theimportance that the various political and economic sectors have in promoting an inclusive approach that takesinto consideration the dignity of every human person and the common good. I am referring to a concern thatought to shape every political and economic decision, but which at times seems to be little more than anafterthought. Those working in these sectors have a precise responsibility towards others, particularly thosewho are most frail, weak, and vulnerable. It is intolerable that thousands of people continue to die every dayfrom hunger, even though substantial quantities of food are available, and often simply wasted. Likewise, wecannot but be moved by the many refugees seeking minimally dignified living conditions, who not only fail tofind hospitality but often, tragically, perish in moving from place to place. I know that these words are forceful,even dramatic, but they seek both to affirm and to challenge the ability of this assembly to make a difference. Infact, those who have demonstrated their aptitude for being innovative and for improving the lives of manypeople by their ingenuity and professional expertise can further contribute by putting their skills at the serviceof those who are still living in dire poverty. What is needed, then, is a renewed, profound, and broadened senseof responsibility on the part of all. “Business is – in fact - a vocation, and a noble vocation provided that thoseengaged in it see themselves challenged by a greater meaning in life” (Evangelii Gaudium, 203). Such men andwomen can serve more effectively the common good and make the goods of this world more accessible to all.Nevertheless, the growth of equality demands something more than economic growth, even though itpresupposes it. It demands first of all “a transcendent vision of the person” (Benedict XVI, Caritas in Veritate,11), because “without the perspective of eternal life, human progress in this world is denied breathing-space”(ibid.). It also calls for decisions, mechanisms, and processes directed to a better distribution of wealth, thecreation of sources of employment, and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfarementality. I am convinced that from such an openness to the transcendent a new political and businessmentality can take shape, one capable of guiding all economic and financial activity within the horizon of anethical approach that is truly humane. The international business community can count on many men andwomen of great personal honesty and integrity, whose work is inspired and guided by high ideals of fairness,generosity, and concern for the authentic development of the human family. I urge you to draw upon thesegreat human and moral resources and to take up this challenge with determination and far-sightedness.Without ignoring, naturally, the specific scientific and professional requirements of every context, I ask you toensure that humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it. Dear Mr. Chairman and friends, I hope that youmay see in these brief words a sign of my pastoral concern and a constructive contribution to help youractivities to be ever more noble and fruitful. I renew my best wishes for a successful meeting, as I invoke divineblessings on you and the participants of the Forum, as well as on your families and all your work.From the Vatican, 17 January 2014     FRANCISCUS PP[515]​ The Illuminati taught that Communism was Christ’s aim, following the teachings of their Jesuit supervisors,to deceive and prepare their candidates for their “enlightened” Satanic mission. Baron Adolph Franz Friedrich"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Ludwig Knigge (1752–1796), German writer, high-level Freemason, and a leading member of the Order of theIlluminati, had personally devised this strategy. He fought hard with Weishaupt to introduce the affirmation of“Christian principles,” as a cover-up for their true agenda, before realizing that Adam Weishaupt was already aJesuit agent who simply didn’t want to look like he was always mimicking his masters. Knigge accused Weishauptof “Jesuitism,” and suspected him of being “a Jesuit in disguise.” Adding with great disappointment, \"And was I tolabor under his banner for mankind, to lead men under the yoke of so stiff-necked a fellow? Never!\"[516]However,according to the anti-Sabbatean Frankist American/ Israeli, Rabbi Marvin Antelman (1933-2013), who, along withhis 13-member Supreme Rabbinical Council of America (SRCA), performed a controversial ex-communication ofHenry Kissinger from Judaism in 1976. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812), the founder of the Rothschilddynasty, convinced Weishaupt to also accept the Frankist doctrine to finance the rise of the Illuminati, as he aimedto fulfill the Frankist plot of subverting the world’s religions[517], which also meant sabotaging the image of Jesus.​ These are the reasons why, after Adam Weishaupt died of old age in 1830, we notice the immediate rise ofthe “Communist Jesus trend” with The League of the Just, a Christian Communist international revolutionaryorganization founded in 1836 by branching off from its ancestor, the League of Outlaws, which had been formed inParis in 1834 by a German disciple of Adam Weishaupt named Theodor Schuster (1808-1872), who modeled hisnew organization closely after Italian Illuminati Philippe Buonarroti's vision of the “Universal DemocraticCarbonari,” as an egalitarian international revolutionary fellowship organization. In 1847, the League of the Justmerged with the Communist Correspondence Committee, an organization led by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels,creating the infamous Communist League. The new group tasked Marx and Engels with writing a political platformfor itself. The resulting document was The Communist Manifesto. [518]The heretical view pushed by the Illuminati that Communism was just Christianity in practice, and Jesus was thefirst Communist, was highlighted in one of Karl Marx's early writings, which stated, “Christ is the intermediary untowhom man unburdens all his divinity, all his religious bonds, so the state is the mediator unto which he transfers allhis Godlessness, all his human liberty.”[519]The Illuminati, instructed in secret by the Jesuits, didn’t stop at the idea that Jesus was a “Communist,” theywere so diabolical that they even envisioned themselves creating a new religion in the future, where Jesus was theirmain founder linked to the mysteries of Ancient Egypt, an idea that will lead to Count Cagliostro’s Egyptian Rite,and the subsequent revival of Gnosticism within Freemasonry, that will later give birth to Aleister Crowley’sThelema, that used in the same heretical way, Jesus Christ, in the upper degrees of his version of the Ordo TempliOrientis where he states “In our Lord Jesus Christ is the Great Work accomplished,” and that explains once and forall, the Egyptian symbolism of the Vatican Nativity Scene placed in Saint Peter’s Square in December 2020.Regarding Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati, they trusted their internal security apparatus would always avoidany future discovery of their manipulative heretical interpretation of Jesus, where only their best recruits wouldunderstand the secular significance of it, and its true Anti-Christian mission. This way, the explanation to therecruits that Illuminism was true Christianity, almost became a standard fixture of many subsequent Illuministsocieties inspired by the Illuminati Order.​ Following this longstanding tradition, Professor Klaus Schwab wants to be perceived, not only as a goodChristian, like most Illuminati members, but somebody genuinely interested in Liberation theology, a controversialreligious movement born in the late 20th-century Roman Catholicism, centered in Latin America. Schwab evenpraised publically last year one of the key figures of the Second Vatican Council, the late Brazilian Catholicarchbishop Hélder Pessoa Câmara (1909-1999), one of the most influential Council Fathers, that helped totransform the Church into that “Pachamama monstrosity” of Pope Francis.Câmara was also an honored speaker of one of the first World Economic Forums in Davos, back in1974. Câmara, a self-proclaimed Marxist, described today by the Co-Creator of the infamous farse of Occupy WallStreet, Mica White, for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting, as “a radical liberation theologist and advocatefor the poor,”[520]was quoted once as having said, “When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I askwhy they are poor, they call me a Communist.”[521] What we must understand is that Pope Francis is a Communist at heart, and he embraced this sickand perverse ideology, mainly because of his friend, Archbishop Hélder Câmara, who was a very influentialIlluminati member, and Câmara even led a secret meeting, on the evening of November 16, 1965, three weeksbefore the close of the Second Vatican Council, that will prove to be a turning point in the history of the CatholicChurch, and the Vatican-led New World Order. To avoid public scrutiny, Archbishop Câmara, with 42 like-mindedbishops, went to the Catacombs of Domitilla, situated over 16 meters underground, around 1 mile from the south ofAppian Way, spread over 15 kilometers underground. Curiously enough, unlike other Roman catacombs, thesecatacombs still hold the remains of humans. During the unusual meeting protected on the surface by a bunch of loyalItalian Mafiosi, they signed a secret document under the title of “Pact of the Catacombs,” with 13 points, that were"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"inspired by Karl Marx.​ This small group of Illuminati/Marxist priests meeting in secret has been the beginning of an existential threatto our very future because what they decided there among those catacombs, influenced the Illuminati elite thatwould create a few years later, the World Economic Forum. Sadly, because of this meeting, South America,traditionally controlled by the Jesuits, has also been unable to rise above Marxism, as it was used for the rise ofliberation theology and the most progressive ideas of the Second Vatican Council. No wonder Archbishop HelderCâmara, Schwab’s mentor, who was credited with taking the lead role in organizing the “Pact of the Catacombs,”became known in the subsequent post-conciliar years as “the Red Bishop,” because of his prominence as one of theleading proponents of Latin American liberation theology which is Marxism engaging socio-economic analyses,rather than theology, that at the core says that material “inequality” is driven by race, or caste, rather than ability.In this way, the Vatican experimented in that influential Catholic part of the world, theinfamous leftist doctrine, born out of the “Pact of the Catacombs,” despite the fact it was never sanctioned, or evenpromoted by the Vatican, until the arrival of Jorge Mario Bergoglio on the papal throne, who practiced this distorteddoctrine for a large portion of his priestly life, before becoming pope. A doctrine focused on material wealth, ratherthan on the spiritual concerns for the soul, that seems another gift out of Adam Weishaupt’s playbook. Point #10 ofthe “Pact of the Catacombs,” truly shows us the relevance it had on the present project for a Great Reset.We will do our utmost so that those responsible for our government and for our public services make, andput into practice, laws, structures, and social institutions required by justice and charity, equality andharmonic and holistic development of all men and women, and by this means to bring about the advent ofanother social order, worthy of the sons and daughters of mankind and of God.​During the controversial “Pachamama” Azon Synod, that took place in October 2019 in Rome, when COVID-19was “coincidentally” starting to spread in China[522], a rather large group of Synod Fathers renewed the “Pact of theCatacombs,” made 54 years earlier, making a pilgrimage to the Catacombs of Domitilla to renew that importantMarxist promise. The event was also reported by Vatican News.[523]But the reason why this obscure meeting, thathappened in the catacombs of Rome in 1965, became so relevant to us today, was fully revealed by Klaus Schwabduring an interview given on the 25th of June 2021, for the 10th anniversary of his Global Shapers Community, whenhe confessed that the infamous “Red Bishop,” Archbishop Hélder Câmara, and his leftist doctrine intervented inwhat he described as a “crucial moment” of his life. Schwab says that when traveling to Brazil for the first time, “Imet a priest known as the priest of the poor people and his name was Hélder Câmara,” [524] he also admitsduring the same interview that they advised him to not invite him to Davos for the annual gathering of the WorldEconomic Forum, because in Switzerland at the time, “he was considered to be a Communist, and I said, this is forme a test. Europe was fortunately still anti-Communist back then, during the Cold War, however, for Schwab, thiswas simply “a test” for him, as “I had to stand up to my values even at the risk of having to give up the WorldEconomic Forum. But it went very well, I have to say. The audience in Davos listened to him.”[525]That “test” was,of course, for Professor Schwab, his public embracing of Communism in front of the Davos elite, that had beenfollowing, until that point, the fierce opposition of both Nazism and Communism, proposed by Illuminati KingpinOtto von Habsburg.Archbishop Câmara, spoke at Davos in 1974, and from that time onwards, Schwab has beentrying to influence world leaders and convince them it is time to adopt Marxism on a global scale, and the GlobalShapers Community, is another one of Schwab’s diabolical libtard creations, aimed to the young people, who areconstantly brainwashed by the left, embracing more than ever the Communist ideal.​ Thus, Weishaupt’s Illuminati said to recruits in the early grades, that their goals were compatible withChristianity, of course, it wasn’t true, just like it is not true that Professor Schwab wants to help the world, especiallyon the premises of a supposed Christian Marxist ideal laid out by the late Archbishop Câmara. Remember, theseSatanists have promoted Communism for the last two centuries, because they fear the principles of monarchy andthe ideal Kingdom, the one that will eventually manifest with the return of our Lord Jesus Christ on the throne, asthey were, and still are, submerged in materialism (watch Freemason/Illuminati Nancy Pelosi, for example, just toname one). Weishaupt would even publish an essay in 1786, a revised and expanded version, of the Docetistsdegree, entitled On Materialism and Idealism (Ueber Materialismus und Idealis (Ueber Materialismus undIdealismus), where he tried to propose a rather weird, and sophisticated refutation of materialism. But a preview ofthe essay that he had given out while he was writing it in 1783, failed to convince his friend and Illuminati member,Johann Friedrich Mieg, a German pastor, Freemason, and professor of Theology at Heidelberg University, who atthat point doubted Weishaupt’s claim that his system amounted to a refutation of materialism.[526] This degree is a"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"philosophical lecture reflecting Weishaupt’s brand of sensualist idealism. It was originally meant to be called,‘Magi’, but the cryptic title Docetists, as it stands, refers to the adherents of an early Christian current whichmaintained the belief that Jesus did not have a physical form and therefore did not die on the cross. Surprisingly, thisparticular gnostic heresy is not even mentioned in the body of the text itself. It would seem that it was usedsymbolically in the heading to indicate that all perception, as mediated by the senses, is inevitably flawed andrestricted.[527]​ This was Adam Weishaupt’s impetus view of the rise of the monarchy in the Rex degree:Consequently, the first leaders of the savage peoples, through their greater share of the bounty and the landsthey had acquired, had the means at hand first to usurp the freedom of the rest of the nation, and then promptlyto forge their own fetters; then to break free from the self-imposed rule of their vassals, reaching theirgreatness of today, becoming truly sovereign, until this power, through their own fault, falls into other handsagain one day, because power abused always destroys itself, and because it is nature’s design that any powerthat one has been given is inevitably abused.This greater share of goods and land which they had been handed by a savage nation in its naivety enabledthese so-called kings to give – and consequently take – and so to strengthen their following. Now free andindependent men, even the most important men among the people, proceeded to sell their freedom and servicesin exchange for land-parcels assigned according to the duration of their service. They in turn surrendered theirshare of the land to others under similar conditions. As a result, free men became rarer, and servants morecommon. Great men gave their services to the king, others to the great men. The previous equality andindependence vanished.[528] ​ Of course, we can agree with certain things exposed above by Adam Weishaupt, especially regarding the“naivety,” that at times enabled “these so-called kings,” to rule over us, but his assumption that “previous equalityand independence vanished,” is false. As there was never a time in the history of humanity, were equality andindependence flourished before the foundation of the United States. That’s the truth I’m afraid. But let me show yousome other comments, made by Weishaupt about monarchs and the monarchy, that we find in another of the“Mysteries Class” upper degrees of the Illuminati.The monarchs’ lust for conquest significantly contributed to completing the subjugation of the nation. Noone was in command of 100,000 people. With these, it felt safe to assault one’s neighbors. As long as the nationhad a share in the spoils of war, it eagerly consented to this. The nation and the kings divided the conqueredlands among themselves. The kings would often cede some of their share to others in order to gain a following,a standing militia against a nation that also desired to command and to keep one part of the people in check bythe other.Thence came feudalism; an invention of monarchs who had more than they needed and used their surplusto govern more absolutely, to gild the shackles of the people, changing from being benefactors of men to beingtheir oppressors. This is the origin of a class of people who served not the nation but the king, ready to workagainst the nation at the slightest nod, the true tools of despotism and the means for suppressing nationalfreedom, the liegemen and the militia established later, both serving a single purpose: the ones paid in money,the others in real property for serving as oppressors and executioners, forced to murder and rob innocentpeople.Now people fell upon people, nations upon nations, and human blood flowed on all sides; the vanquishedbecame a new class of people, called slaves, subject to the whim of the conqueror, without income or property.These were foolish nations, who did not foresee what was to happen to them, who helped the despot tolower human dignity to that of cattle so he could one day attempt the same with them. The slavery of thevanquished became the means for the slavery of the conquerors. Their crime was avenged on theirdescendants. They only needed to abandon their strict morals, succumb to effeminacy, and develop a taste forsensual pleasures, for which the abundance of the gathered spoils had prepared them; thus, the victor wasvanquished, and the vanquished became the victor.These consequences arising from the establishment of the states were significant, but they were not the onlyones. Men who once had dared the first step in good faith now competed in the art of finding means for theirown debasement.Initially, such men who had raised their nation from nothing to greatness could only be regarded asextraordinary men, even gods, by their blind subordinates, who only saw the present and could not believe that"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"he who had benefited them so much might also harm them in the future. One would gladly have wished themimmortality. As a very natural consequence of human short-sightedness, this reverence also had to be extendedto their children and relatives. In the eyes of the people, the son of a benefactor appeared as anotherbenefactor. It was still a kind of an election that determined the successor. Out of reverence for the initialbenefactor one did not look outside his family. By and by, however, rule by-election became rule byinheritance, and, later still, as the princes began to take the place of the state and the nation, regarding thepeople as their inheritance and property, once the tumult of war had subsided and the nation was betterprepared for servitude by the refinement of customs and the love of convenience when the first fathers,children, and grandchildren of the nascent people were no longer alive and the degenerate, weakly great-grandchildren had forgotten their rights, then, at last, the patrimonial kingdoms were born, and despotism fellupon a carefree humanity.​ That was part of the instructions for the Lesser Priest Degree, Presbyter, of the Illuminati, that is alsocritical towards the monarchy, but even Weishaupt admits in the instructions in question, citing various passages of“the book called the Apocalypse, or Revelation of Saint John,” that “everything shall be reversed,” leading to aperiod “called the new heaven, the new earth,” where we will have “a solid kingdom that cannot be moved. No moretemples will be built, since God Almighty himself will dwell among men, and there will be only one truth on theface of the earth. No one must fear suffering for this truth.”[529] It seemed like the diabolical plan of AdamWeishaupt’s Illuminati was devised to destroy all the monarchies that opposed his authority, or at least control themfor the time being, to later facilitate one day, thanks to the future Illuminati, the rise of the Antichrist, linking him tothe return of the son of God, that Weishaupt portrays as the ultimate master of the Age of Reason, without evermentioning even once, his role as Our Lord and Saviour, or Christ's grace, that erases our original sin and turns aman back towards God.This our grand and unforgettable master, Jesus of Nazareth, came to us in a historical period during whichthe world had fallen into a state of general corruption, to a people that had felt the oppression of servitudemost emphatically since time immemorial and hoped for its redemption heralded by the prophets, in a countrythat lay at the center of the then-known world. These people He instructed in the doctrines of reason, and inorder to increase their efficacy, He shrewdly joined this simple religion of reason with the then prevailingpopular religion, using all ruling traditions and customs and concealing the inner, essential parts of histeachings therein.[530]​ With this heretical aim in mind from the very start, Weishaupt wrote an explanation of the Masonic symbolsfor his Freemasonic set of degrees (Freemasonic Class), that he elaborated with the help of the Jesuit abbateGiuseppe Marotti, (who was later to become the secretary of Pope Pius VI),[531] that culminates in the diabolicalrevelation of the secret that Hiram (yes the Masonic Hiram Abiff), is Jesus, that Freemasonry is a vessel forcommunicating his secret teachings, and that taking heed of his great yet unaccomplished revolution is the true taskof every Mason.[532] This way all the Masons who become “Illuminati Freemasons,” without knowing the true Anti-Christian purpose of the Order, which can be understood only by studying the instructions of the high degrees, havea new internal doctrine that fully reconciled Freemasonry with Christianity. While the future Priest of the Order wastold, “that the teachings of Jesus Christ have been misunderstood and distorted, and that their true purpose was toreturn humanity to its original dignity and freedom by tempering men’s passions and curbing their needs.”[533] Thisway the Machiavellian Jesuitic scheme set up by ProfessorAdam Weishaupt, laid the future foundations for theAntichrist, the ultimate enemy of Christ.In the meantime, Weishaupt was able to change the course of history promoting Communism,sometimes referred to as revolutionary Socialism, and eliminating most of the world monarchies in the process, or atleast submitting them to the will and decisions, of the Illuminati, preparing the path for future members, likeProfessor Klaus Schwab, who these days influences in the same way royals like Prince Charles. Interestingly,Weishaupt and Schwab, aside from both being German, were both University professors before launching theirprojects for world domination.​ And now, let me go back to a summary of the important role of the monarchy in our society. Britannicadescribes monarchy in the following way: “The monarchy, political system based upon the undivided sovereignty orrule of a single person. The term applies to states in which supreme authority is vested in the monarch, an individualruler who functions as the head of state and who achieves his or her position through heredity.”[534] In this context,there are two kinds of monarchy, one is called an absolute monarchy, which is a form of monarchy in which themonarch is the only one to decide and therefore rules on his own, the other is a constitutional monarchy, in which"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"the monarch exercises their authority following a constitution and is not alone in deciding. Thanks to the Illuminati,and after the Jesuits abandoned their goal for a “Universal Monarchy” under the Roman pontiff, the widespreadconcept of an absolute monarchy declined substantially in Europe, following the French Revolution and World WarI, which promoted theories of governments based on the notion of popular sovereignty, which was a notion,originally instigated by Weishaupt. Even the Vatican, which is one of the most unique countries, in that it is anelective ecclesiastical monarchy, after the Second Vatican Council, abandoned the Papal Coronation ceremony inwhich the new pope was crowned after his election with a Papal Tiara, which in later centuries was triple-tiered. Themost recent was the 1963 coronation of Freemason Paul VI, who soon afterward abandoned the practice of wearingthe tiara to please the Illuminati.​ The first states were mostly monarchies, as far as we can tell. They were ruled by kings or queens. Theearliest monarchies that we know about are the ones in Sumer and Egypt. These both began around 3000 BC. But itwas not only the early states which had kings and queens. After all, there are still many countries that have kings andqueens, even today, and only two years ago, in January 2020, a court in Thailand acquitted of a sedition charge, oneof the country's largest opposition parties, called Future Forward, after it was accused of having links to theIlluminati seeking to overthrow the monarchy.[535]However, other examples of places that were ruled by kings are Greece in the Late Bronze Age, as described inHomers’ Iliad, the Etruscan cities in northern Italy, including Rome between about 700 and 500 BC, China in theWarring States period, the Early Medieval kingdoms of Western Europe and Africa like the Visigoths, the Vandals,the Franks, Ethiopia and Mali, and the later medieval kingdoms (both Christian and Islamic) of France, England, andSpain. [536]People often think that in ancient and medieval times only men could rule, but that’s not correct. Therehave indeed been many more men in power than women, but there have always been women rulers too, and verypowerful ones, like Elizabeth I for example, who, with her vast spy network I talked about in Volume 1 of myConfessions, created the first “Surveillance State.”[537] Some women who ruled over Egypt, like Hatshepsut andCleopatra, and women who ruled the Byzantine Empire, like Irene. Some women who ruled France, like Catherinede Medici, who was said to have performed the first Black Mass, and before her, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen ofFrance from 1137 to 1152, as the wife of King Louis VII, and Queen of England from 1154 to 1189, as the wife ofKing Henry II, and women who ruled Castile in Spain, like Isabelle, and women who ruled the kingdom of Kush inAfrica, and even a Chinese Empresses, called Lu, the first woman to assume the title Empress of China, as well asEmpresses Wu Chao, the de facto ruler of the Tang dynasty. Many other women held power without having theofficial title, often as regents for their sons or grandsons, like Agrippina and Julia Maesa in Rome, or Blanche ofCastile in France. Throughout history, royal dynasties have dominated countries and empires around the world.Kings, queens, emperors, chiefs, pharaohs, czars -- whatever title they ruled by monarchs have shaped institutions,rituals, and cultures in every period of history and every corner of the globe.The concept of monarchy originated in prehistoric times and evolved over centuries, right up to thepresent, so there was never “a carefree humanity,” or “a previous equality and independence” as Weishaupt claimed.Efforts to overthrow monarchies or evade their rule -- such as the American, French, Chinese, and Russianrevolutions -- are considered turning points in world history, but only the United States has been, up until now, asuccessful experiment. Even today, many countries retain their monarchies, although in vastly reduced form withlittle or no political power due to the Illuminati.Remember, one cannot fully understand human history and government without understanding monarchs andmonarchies, and their importance in the development of our present society. World history proves that thecivilization of any country, including America, was built by the monarchy; It is difficult to imagine civilizationgrowing in India without the influence of Mughal Emperors Ashok and Akbar. Whether the Great Wall of China orthe Pyramids of Egypt, monarchy builds great things, but it also was corrupted to brainwash people into thinking ofit as a useless relic of the past. But remember, there is no civilization living today which did not originate in thework and effort of a monarchy. And in the end, remember “normal” is not coming back, Jesus is, and he will be amonarch, not a president.God Bless America and our future King Jesus Christ,AmenLeo Lyon ZagamiPalm Springs, January 22, 2022."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"FIG. 50 –– Brazilian Catholic Archbishop Hélder Pessoa Câmara (1909–1999) a self-identified socialist known as the “Red Bishop” for hisCommunist tendencies was declared a Servant of God in 2015 thanks to Pope Francis.

Thought reflects perception andperception leads to both behaviour and self-identity. In that sense‘we’ are what we think. But who or what is doing the thinking and isthinking the only route to perception? Clearly, as we shall see, ‘we’are not always the source of ‘our’ perception, indeed with regard tohumanity as a whole this is rarely the case; and thinking is far fromthe only means of perception. Thought is the village idiot comparedwith other expressions of consciousness that we all have thepotential to access and tap into. This has to be true when we arethose other expressions of consciousness which are infinite in nature.We have forgo\u0000en this, or, more to the point, been manipulated toforget.These are not just the esoteric musings of the navel. The wholefoundation of human control and oppression is control ofperception. Once perception is hijacked then so is behaviour whichis dictated by perception. Collective perception becomes collectivebehaviour and collective behaviour is what we call human society.Perception is all and those behind human control know that which is"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"why perception is the target 24/7 of the psychopathic manipulatorsthat I call the Global Cult. They know that if they dictate perceptionthey will dictate behaviour and collectively dictate the nature ofhuman society. They are further aware that perception is formedfrom information received and if they control the circulation ofinformation they will to a vast extent direct human behaviour.Censorship of information and opinion has become globally Nazi-like in recent years and never more blatantly than since the illusory‘virus pandemic’ was triggered out of China in 2019 and across theworld in 2020. Why have billions submi\u0000ed to house arrest andaccepted fascistic societies in a way they would have never believedpossible? Those controlling the information spewing fromgovernment, mainstream media and Silicon Valley (all controlled bythe same Global Cult networks) told them they were in danger froma ‘deadly virus’ and only by submi\u0000ing to house arrest andconceding their most basic of freedoms could they and their familiesbe protected. This monumental and provable lie became theperception of the billions and therefore the behaviour of the billions. Inthose few words you have the whole structure and modus operandiof human control. Fear is a perception – False Emotion AppearingReal – and fear is the currency of control. In short ... get them by theballs (or give them the impression that you have) and their heartsand minds will follow. Nothing grips the dangly bits and freezes therear-end more comprehensively than fear.World number 1There are two ‘worlds’ in what appears to be one ‘world’ and theprime difference between them is knowledge. First we have the massof human society in which the population is maintained in coldly-calculated ignorance through control of information and the‘education’ (indoctrination) system. That’s all you really need tocontrol to enslave billions in a perceptual delusion in which what areperceived to be their thoughts and opinions are ever-repeatedmantras that the system has been downloading all their livesthrough ‘education’, media, science, medicine, politics and academia"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"in which the personnel and advocates are themselvesoverwhelmingly the perceptual products of the same repetition.Teachers and academics in general are processed by the sameprogramming machine as everyone else, but unlike the greatmajority they never leave the ‘education’ program. It gripped themas students and continues to grip them as programmers ofsubsequent generations of students. The programmed become theprogrammers – the programmed programmers. The same canlargely be said for scientists, doctors and politicians and not leastbecause as the American writer Upton Sinclair said: ‘It is difficult toget a man to understand something when his salary depends uponhis not understanding it.’ If your career and income depend onthinking the way the system demands then you will – bar a few free-minded exceptions – concede your mind to the PerceptualMainframe that I call the Postage Stamp Consensus. This is a tinyband of perceived knowledge and possibility ‘taught’ (downloaded)in the schools and universities, pounded out by the mainstreammedia and on which all government policy is founded. Try thinking,and especially speaking and acting, outside of the ‘box’ of consensusand see what that does for your career in the Mainstream Everythingwhich bullies, harasses, intimidates and ridicules the population intocompliance. Here we have the simple structure which enslaves mostof humanity in a perceptual prison cell for an entire lifetime and I’llgo deeper into this process shortly. Most of what humanity is taughtas fact is nothing more than programmed belief. American sciencefiction author Frank Herbert was right when he said: ‘Belief can bemanipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.’ In the ‘Covid’ agebelief is promoted and knowledge is censored. It was always so, butnever to the extreme of today.World number 2A ‘number 2’ is slang for ‘doing a poo’ and how appropriate that iswhen this other ‘world’ is doing just that on humanity every minuteof every day. World number 2 is a global network of secret societiesand semi-secret groups dictating the direction of society via"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"governments, corporations and authorities of every kind. I havespent more than 30 years uncovering and exposing this network thatI call the Global Cult and knowing its agenda is what has made mybooks so accurate in predicting current and past events. Secretsocieties are secret for a reason. They want to keep their hoardedknowledge to themselves and their chosen initiates and to hide itfrom the population which they seek through ignorance to controland subdue. The whole foundation of the division between World 1and World 2 is knowledge. What number 1 knows number 2 must not.Knowledge they have worked so hard to keep secret includes (a) theagenda to enslave humanity in a centrally-controlled globaldictatorship, and (b) the nature of reality and life itself. The la\u0000er (b)must be suppressed to allow the former (a) to prevail as I shall beexplaining. The way the Cult manipulates and interacts with thepopulation can be likened to a spider’s web. The ‘spider’ sits at thecentre in the shadows and imposes its will through the web witheach strand represented in World number 2 by a secret society,satanic or semi-secret group, and in World number 1 – the world ofthe seen – by governments, agencies of government, lawenforcement, corporations, the banking system, mediaconglomerates and Silicon Valley (Fig 1 overleaf). The spider and theweb connect and coordinate all these organisations to pursue thesame global outcome while the population sees them as individualentities working randomly and independently. At the level of theweb governments are the banking system are the corporations are themedia are Silicon Valley are the World Health Organization workingfrom their inner cores as one unit. Apparently unconnectedcountries, corporations, institutions, organisations and people are onthe same team pursuing the same global outcome. Strands in the webimmediately around the spider are the most secretive and exclusivesecret societies and their membership is emphatically restricted tothe Cult inner-circle emerging through the generations fromparticular bloodlines for reasons I will come to. At the core of thecore you would get them in a single room. That’s how many peopleare dictating the direction of human society and its transformation"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"through the ‘Covid’ hoax and other means. As the web expands outfrom the spider we meet the secret societies that many people will beaware of – the Freemasons, Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, OpusDei, the inner sanctum of the Jesuit Order, and such like. Note howmany are connected to the Church of Rome and there is a reason forthat. The Roman Church was established as a revamp, a rebranding,of the relocated ‘Church’ of Babylon and the Cult imposing globaltyranny today can be tracked back to Babylon and Sumer in what isnow Iraq.Figure 1: The global web through which the few control the many. (Image Neil Hague.)Inner levels of the web operate in the unseen away from the publiceye and then we have what I call the cusp organisations located atthe point where the hidden meets the seen. They include a series ofsatellite organisations answering to a secret society founded inLondon in the late 19th century called the Round Table and amongthem are the Royal Institute of International Affairs (UK, founded in1920); Council on Foreign Relations (US, 1921); Bilderberg Group(worldwide, 1954); Trilateral Commission (US/worldwide, 1972); andthe Club of Rome (worldwide, 1968) which was created to exploitenvironmental concerns to justify the centralisation of global powerto ‘save the planet’. The Club of Rome instigated with others thehuman-caused climate change hoax which has led to all the ‘green"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"new deals’ demanding that very centralisation of control. Cusporganisations, which include endless ‘think tanks’ all over the world,are designed to coordinate a single global policy between politicaland business leaders, intelligence personnel, media organisationsand anyone who can influence the direction of policy in their ownsphere of operation. Major players and regular a\u0000enders will knowwhat is happening – or some of it – while others come and go andare kept overwhelmingly in the dark about the big picture. I refer tothese cusp groupings as semi-secret in that they can be publiclyidentified, but what goes on at the inner-core is kept very much ‘inhouse’ even from most of their members and participants through afiercely-imposed system of compartmentalisation. Only let themknow what they need to know to serve your interests and no more.The structure of secret societies serves as a perfect example of thisprinciple. Most Freemasons never get higher than the bo\u0000om threelevels of ‘degree’ (degree of knowledge) when there are 33 officialdegrees of the Sco\u0000ish Rite. Initiates only qualify for the next higher‘compartment’ or degree if those at that level choose to allow them.Knowledge can be carefully assigned only to those considered ‘safe’.I went to my local Freemason’s lodge a few years ago when theywere having an ‘open day’ to show how cuddly they were and whenI cha\u0000ed to some of them I was astonished at how li\u0000le the rank andfile knew even about the most ubiquitous symbols they use. Themushroom technique – keep them in the dark and feed them bullshit– applies to most people in the web as well as the population as awhole. Sub-divisions of the web mirror in theme and structuretransnational corporations which have a headquarters somewhere inthe world dictating to all their subsidiaries in different countries.Subsidiaries operate in their methodology and branding to the samecentrally-dictated plan and policy in pursuit of particular ends. TheCult web functions in the same way. Each country has its own webas a subsidiary of the global one. They consist of networks of secretsocieties, semi-secret groups and bloodline families and their job isto impose the will of the spider and the global web in their particularcountry. Subsidiary networks control and manipulate the nationalpolitical system, finance, corporations, media, medicine, etc. to"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ensure that they follow the globally-dictated Cult agenda. Thesenetworks were the means through which the ‘Covid’ hoax could beplayed out with almost every country responding in the same way.The ‘Yessir’ pyramidCompartmentalisation is the key to understanding how a tiny fewcan dictate the lives of billions when combined with a top-downsequence of imposition and acquiescence. The inner core of the Cultsits at the peak of the pyramidal hierarchy of human society (Fig 2overleaf).

Common themes with personnel are matched by common goals.The ‘solutions’ to both ‘problems’ are centralisation of global powerto impose the will of the few on the many to ‘save’ humanity from‘Covid’ and save the planet from an ‘existential threat’ (we need‘zero Covid’ and ‘zero carbon emissions’). These, in turn, connectwith the ‘dot’ of globalisation which was coined to describe thecentralisation of global power in every area of life through incessantpolitical and corporate expansion, trading blocks and superstateslike the European Union. If you are the few and you want to controlthe many you have to centralise power and decision-making. Themore you centralise power the more power the few at the centre willhave over the many; and the more that power is centralised the morepower those at the centre have to centralise even quicker. Themomentum of centralisation gets faster and faster which is exactlythe process we have witnessed. In this way the hoaxed ‘pandemic’and the fakery of human-caused global warming serve the interestsof globalisation and the seizure of global power in the hands of theCult inner-circle which is behind ‘Covid’, ‘climate change’ andglobalisation. At this point random ‘dots’ become a clear andobvious picture or pa\u0000ern.Klaus Schwab, the classic Bond villain who founded the Cult’sGates-funded World Economic Forum, published a book in 2020, TheGreat Reset, in which he used the ‘problem’ of ‘Covid’ to justify atotal transformation of human society to ‘save’ humanity from‘climate change’. Schwab said: ‘The pandemic represents a rare butnarrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset ourworld.’ What he didn’t mention is that the Cult he serves is behindboth hoaxes as I show in my book The Answer.

Their job is not to imagine, but toget humanity to imagine and agree with their plans while believingit’s all random.

Problem-Reaction-Solution is the techniqueused to manipulate us every day by covertly creating a problem (orthe illusion of one) and offering the solution to the problem (or theillusion of one).

This may relateto a financial collapse, terrorist a\u0000ack, war, global warming orpandemic, anything in fact that will allow you to impose the‘solution’ to change society in the way you desire at that time. The‘problem’ doesn’t have to be real. PRS is manipulation of perceptionand all you need is the population to believe the problem is real.Human-caused global warming and the ‘Covid pandemic’ only haveto be perceived to be real for the population to accept the ‘solutions’ ofauthority. I refer to this technique as NO-Problem-Reaction-Solution.Billions did not meekly accept house arrest from early 2020 becausethere was a real deadly ‘Covid pandemic’ but because theyperceived – believed – that to be the case. The antidote to Problem-Reaction-Solution is to ask who benefits from the proposed solution.Invariably it will be anyone who wants to justify more controlthrough deletion of freedom and centralisation of power anddecision-making.The two world wars were Problem-Reaction-Solutions thattransformed and realigned global society.

The technique is fashioned to hide thecarefully-coordinated behind the cover of apparently random events.You start the sequence at ‘A’ and you know you are heading for ‘Z’.You don’t want people to know that and each step on the journey ispresented as a random happening while all the steps strung togetherlead in the same direction. The speed may have quickeneddramatically in recent times, but you can still see the incrementalapproach of the Tiptoe in the case of ‘Covid’ as each new impositiontakes us deeper into fascism. Tell people they have to do this or thatto get back to ‘normal’, then this and this and this. With each newdemand adding to the ones that went before the population’sfreedom is deleted until it disappears. The spider wraps its webaround the flies more comprehensively with each new diktat. I’llhighlight this in more detail when I get to the ‘Covid’ hoax and howit has been pulled off. Another prime example of the TotalitarianTiptoe is how the Cult-created European Union went from a ‘free-trade zone’ to a centralised bureaucratic dictatorship through theTiptoe of incremental centralisation of power until nations becamemere administrative units for Cult-owned dark suits in Brussels.The antidote to ignorance is knowledge which the Cult seeksvehemently to deny us, but despite the systematic censorship to thatend the Renegade Mind can overcome this by vociferously seekingout the facts no ma\u0000er the impediments put in the way.

We’re going to put gateways to thecloud in our brains ... We’re going to gradually merge and enhance ourselves ... In my view,that’s the nature of being human – we transcend our limitations.As the technology becomes vastly superior to what we are then the small proportion that isstill human gets smaller and smaller and smaller until it’s just utterly negligible.The sales-pitch of Kurzweil and Cult-owned Silicon Valley is thatthis would make us ‘super-human’ when the real aim is to make uspost-human and no longer ‘human’ in the sense that we have cometo know. The entire global population would be connected to AI andbecome the centrally-controlled ‘hive-mind’ of externally-deliveredperceptions. The Smart Grid being installed to impose the Cult’s willon the world is being constructed to allow particular locations – evenone location – to control the whole global system. From these primecontrol centres, which absolutely include China and Israel, anythingconnected to the Internet would be switched on or off andmanipulated at will. Energy systems could be cut, communicationvia the Internet taken down, computer-controlled driverlessautonomous vehicles driven off the road, medical devices switchedoff, the potential is limitless given how much AI and Internetconnections now run human society.

The picture is far bigger even thanthe Cult global network or web and that will become clear when Iget to the nature of the ‘spider’. There is a connection between allthese happenings and the instigation of DNA-manipulating‘vaccines’ (which aren’t ‘vaccines’) justified by the ‘Covid’ hoax. Thatconnection is the unfolding plan to transform the human body froma biological to a synthetic biological state and this is why syntheticbiology is such a fast-emerging discipline of mainstream science.‘Covid vaccines’ are infusing self-replicating synthetic geneticmaterial into the cells to cumulatively take us on the TotalitarianTiptoe from Human 1.0 to the synthetic biological Human 2.0 whichwill be physically and perceptually a\u0000ached to the Smart Grid to onehundred percent control every thought, perception and deed.Humanity needs to wake up and fast.This is the barest explanation of where the ‘outcome’ is planned togo but it’s enough to see the journey happening all around us.

Martinsimple definition of the difference between a programmedmind and a Renegade Mind would be that one sees only dotswhile the other connects them to see the picture. Reading realitywith accuracy requires the observer to (a) know the plannedoutcome and (b) realise that everything, but everything, is connected.The entirety of infinite reality is connected – that’s its very nature –and with human society an expression of infinite reality the samemust apply. Simple cause and effect is a connection. The effect istriggered by the cause and the effect then becomes the cause ofanother effect. Nothing happens in isolation because it can’t. Life inwhatever reality is simple choice and consequence. We make choicesand these lead to consequences. If we don’t like the consequences wecan make different choices and get different consequences whichlead to other choices and consequences. The choice and theconsequence are not only connected they are indivisible. You can’thave one without the other as an old song goes. A few cannotcontrol the world unless those being controlled allow that to happen– cause and effect, choice and consequence.

In the same way world events of every kind are connected andthe Cult works incessantly to sell the illusion of the random andcoincidental to maintain the essential (to them) perception of dotsthat hide the picture. Renegade Minds know this and constantlyscan the world for pa\u0000erns of connection. This is absolutely pivotalin understanding the happenings in the world and without thatperspective clarity is impossible. First you know the plannedoutcome and then you identify the steps on the journey – the day-by-day apparently random which, when connected in relation to theoutcome, no longer appear as individual events, but as theproverbial chain of events leading in the same direction. I’ll give yousome examples:Political puppet showWe are told to believe that politics is ‘adversarial’ in that differentparties with different beliefs engage in an endless tussle for power.There may have been some truth in that up to a point – and only apoint – but today divisions between ‘different’ parties are rhetoricalnot ideological. Even the rhetorical is fusing into one-speak as theparties eject any remaining free thinkers while others succumb to theever-gathering intimidation of anyone with the ‘wrong’ opinion. TheCult is not a new phenomenon and can be traced back thousands ofyears as my books have documented. Its intergenerational initiateshave been manipulating events with increasing effect the more thatglobal power has been centralised. In ancient times the Cult securedcontrol through the system of monarchy in which ‘special’bloodlines (of which more later) demanded the right to rule as kingsand queens simply by birthright and by vanquishing others whoclaimed the same birthright. There came a time, however, whenpeople had matured enough to see the unfairness of such tyrannyand demanded a say in who governed them. Note the word –governed them. Not served them – governed them, hence governmentdefined as ‘the political direction and control exercised over the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities,societies, and states; direction of the affairs of a state, community,etc.’ Governments exercise control over rather than serve just like themonarchies before them. Bizarrely there are still countries like theUnited Kingdom which are ruled by a monarch and a governmentthat officially answers to the monarch. The UK head of state and thatof Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and NewZealand is ‘selected’ by who in a single family had unprotected sexwith whom and in what order. Pinch me it can’t be true. Ouch! Shit,it is. The demise of monarchies in most countries offered a potentialvacuum in which some form of free and fair society could arise andthe Cult had that base covered. Monarchies had served its interestsbut they couldn’t continue in the face of such widespread oppositionand, anyway, replacing a ‘royal’ dictatorship that people could seewith a dictatorship ‘of the people’ hiding behind the concept of‘democracy’ presented far greater manipulative possibilities andways of hiding coordinated tyranny behind the illusion of ‘freedom’.Democracy is quite wrongly defined as government selected bythe population. This is not the case at all. It is government selectedby some of the population (and then only in theory). This ‘some’doesn’t even have to be the majority as we have seen so o\u0000en in first-past-the-post elections in which the so-called majority party winsfewer votes than the ‘losing’ parties combined. Democracy can givetotal power to a party in government from a minority of the votescast. It’s a sleight of hand to sell tyranny as freedom. Seventy-fourmillion Trump-supporting Americans didn’t vote for the‘Democratic’ Party of Joe Biden in the distinctly dodgy election in2020 and yet far from acknowledging the wishes and feelings of thatgreat percentage of American society the Cult-owned Bidengovernment set out from day one to destroy them and their right to avoice and opinion. Empty shell Biden and his Cult handlers saidthey were doing this to ‘protect democracy’. Such is the level oflunacy and sickness to which politics has descended. Connect thedots and relate them to the desired outcome – a world governmentrun by self-appointed technocrats and no longer even elected"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"politicians. While operating through its political agents ingovernment the Cult is at the same time encouraging public distainfor politicians by pu\u0000ing idiots and incompetents in theoreticalpower on the road to deleting them. The idea is to instil a publicreaction that says of the technocrats: ‘Well, they couldn’t do anyworse than the pathetic politicians.’ It’s all about controllingperception and Renegade Minds can see through that whileprogrammed minds cannot when they are ignorant of both theplanned outcome and the manipulation techniques employed tosecure that end. This knowledge can be learned, however, and fast ifpeople choose to get informed.Politics may at first sight appear very difficult to control from acentral point. I mean look at the ‘different’ parties and how wouldyou be able to oversee them all and their constituent parts? In truth,it’s very straightforward because of their structure. We are back tothe pyramid of imposition and acquiescence. Organisations arestructured in the same way as the system as a whole. Political partiesare not open forums of free expression. They are hierarchies. I was anational spokesman for the British Green Party which claimed to bea different kind of politics in which influence and power wasdevolved; but I can tell you from direct experience – and it’s farworse now – that Green parties are run as hierarchies like all theothers however much they may try to hide that fact or kidthemselves that it’s not true. A very few at the top of all politicalparties are directing policy and personnel. They decide if you areelevated in the party or serve as a government minister and to dothat you have to be a yes man or woman. Look at all the maverickpolitical thinkers who never ascended the greasy pole. If you want toprogress within the party or reach ‘high-office’ you need to fall intoline and conform. Exceptions to this are rare indeed. Should youwant to run for parliament or Congress you have to persuade thelocal or state level of the party to select you and for that you need toplay the game as dictated by the hierarchy. If you secure election andwish to progress within the greater structure you need to go onconforming to what is acceptable to those running the hierarchy"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"from the peak of the pyramid. Political parties are perceptual gulagsand the very fact that there are party ‘Whips’ appointed to ‘whip’politicians into voting the way the hierarchy demands exposes theridiculous idea that politicians are elected to serve the people theyare supposed to represent. Cult operatives and manipulation haslong seized control of major parties that have any chance of forminga government and at least most of those that haven’t. A new partyforms and the Cult goes to work to infiltrate and direct. This hasreached such a level today that you see video compilations of‘leaders’ of all parties whether Democrats, Republicans,Conservative, Labour and Green parroting the same Cult mantra of‘Build Back Be\u0000er’ and the ‘Great Reset’ which are straight off theCult song-sheet to describe the transformation of global society inresponse to the Cult-instigated hoaxes of the ‘Covid pandemic’ andhuman-caused ‘climate change’. To see Caroline Lucas, the GreenParty MP that I knew when I was in the party in the 1980s, speakingin support of plans proposed by Cult operative Klaus Schwabrepresenting the billionaire global elite is a real head-shaker.Many parties – one masterThe party system is another mind-trick and was instigated to changethe nature of the dictatorship by swapping ‘royalty’ for dark suitsthat people believed – though now ever less so – represented theirinterests. Understanding this trick is to realise that a single force (theCult) controls all parties either directly in terms of the major ones orthrough manipulation of perception and ideology with others. Youdon’t need to manipulate Green parties to demand yourtransformation of society in the name of ‘climate change’ when theyare obsessed with the lie that this is essential to ‘save the planet’. Youjust give them a platform and away they go serving your interestswhile believing they are being environmentally virtuous. America’spolitical structure is a perfect blueprint for how the two or multi-party system is really a one-party state.

This is how it works in almost every country and certainly inBritain with Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Greenparties now all on the same page whatever the rhetoric may be intheir feeble a\u0000empts to appear different.

We have ‘different’ parties and ‘different’people, but the same unfolding script. The more the Cult has seizedthe reigns of parties and personnel the more their policies havetransparently pursued the same agenda to the point where thefascist ‘Covid’ impositions of the Conservative junta of JackbootJohnson in Britain were opposed by the Labour Party because theywere not fascist enough. The Labour Party is likened to the USDemocrats while the Conservative Party is akin to a British versionof the Republicans and on both sides of the Atlantic they all speakthe same language and support the direction demanded by the Cultalthough some more enthusiastically than others. It’s a similar storyin country a\u0000er country because it’s all centrally controlled. Oh, butwhat about Trump? I’ll come to him shortly. Political ‘choice’ in the‘party’ system goes like this: You vote for Party A and they get intogovernment. You don’t like what they do so next time you vote forParty B and they get into government. You don’t like what they dowhen it’s pre\u0000y much the same as Party A and why wouldn’t that bewith both controlled by the same force?

This, ladies and gentlemen, is whatthey call ‘democracy’ which we are told – wrongly – is a terminterchangeable with ‘freedom’.The cult of cultsAt this point I need to introduce a major expression of the GlobalCult known as Sabbatian-Frankism. Sabbatian is also spelt asSabbatean. I will summarise here. I have published major exposés"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"and detailed background in other works. Sabbatian-Frankismcombines the names of two frauds posing as ‘Jewish’ men, SabbataiZevi (1626-1676), a rabbi, black magician and occultist whoproclaimed he was the Jewish messiah; and Jacob Frank (1726-1791),the Polish ‘Jew’, black magician and occultist who said he was thereincarnation of ‘messiah’ Zevi and biblical patriarch Jacob. Theyworked across two centuries to establish the Sabbatian-Frankist cultthat plays a major, indeed central, role in the manipulation of humansociety by the Global Cult which has its origins much further back inhistory than Sabbatai Zevi. I should emphasise two points here inresponse to the shrill voices that will scream ‘anti-Semitism’: (1)Sabbatian-Frankists are NOT Jewish and only pose as such to hidetheir cult behind a Jewish façade; and (2) my information about thiscult has come from Jewish sources who have long realised that theirsociety and community has been infiltrated and taken over byinterloper Sabbatian-Frankists. Infiltration has been the foundationtechnique of Sabbatian-Frankism from its official origin in the 17thcentury. Zevi’s Sabbatian sect a\u0000racted a massive followingdescribed as the biggest messianic movement in Jewish history,spreading as far as Africa and Asia, and he promised a return for theJews to the ‘Promised Land’ of Israel. Sabbatianism was not Judaismbut an inversion of everything that mainstream Judaism stood for. Somuch so that this sinister cult would have a feast day when Judaismhad a fast day and whatever was forbidden in Judaism theSabbatians were encouraged and even commanded to do. Thisincluded incest and what would be today called Satanism. Memberswere forbidden to marry outside the sect and there was a system ofkeeping their children ignorant of what they were part of until theywere old enough to be trusted not to unknowingly reveal anythingto outsiders. The same system is employed to this day by the GlobalCult in general which Sabbatian-Frankism has enormouslyinfluenced and now largely controls.Zevi and his Sabbatians suffered a setback with the interventionby the Sultan of the Islamic O\u0000oman Empire in the Middle East andwhat is now the Republic of Turkey where Zevi was located. The"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Sultan gave him the choice of proving his ‘divinity’, converting toIslam or facing torture and death. Funnily enough Zevi chose toconvert or at least appear to. Some of his supporters weredisillusioned and dri\u0000ed away, but many did not with 300 familiesalso converting – only in theory – to Islam. They continued behindthis Islamic smokescreen to follow the goals, rules and rituals ofSabbatianism and became known as ‘crypto-Jews’ or the ‘Dönmeh’which means ‘to turn’. This is rather ironic because they didn’t ‘turn’and instead hid behind a fake Islamic persona. The process ofappearing to be one thing while being very much another wouldbecome the calling card of Sabbatianism especially a\u0000er Zevi’s deathand the arrival of the Satanist Jacob Frank in the 18th century whenthe cult became Sabbatian-Frankism and plumbed still new depthsof depravity and infiltration which included – still includes – humansacrifice and sex with children. Wherever Sabbatians go paedophiliaand Satanism follow and is it really a surprise that Hollywood is soinfested with child abuse and Satanism when it was established bySabbatian-Frankists and is still controlled by them? Hollywood hasbeen one of the prime vehicles for global perceptual programmingand manipulation. How many believe the version of ‘history’portrayed in movies when it is a travesty and inversion (again) of thetruth? Rabbi Marvin Antelman describes Frankism in his book, ToEliminate the Opiate, as ‘a movement of complete evil’ while Jewishprofessor Gershom Scholem said of Frank in The Messianic Idea inJudaism: ‘In all his actions [he was] a truly corrupt and degenerateindividual ... one of the most frightening phenomena in the whole ofJewish history.’ Frank was excommunicated by traditional rabbis, aswas Zevi, but Frank was undeterred and enjoyed vital support fromthe House of Rothschild, the infamous banking dynasty whoseinner-core are Sabbatian-Frankists and not Jews. Infiltration of theRoman Church and Vatican was instigated by Frank with manyDönmeh ‘turning’ again to convert to Roman Catholicism with aview to hijacking the reins of power.

They did this with Judaism, Christianity(Christian Zionism is part of this), Islam and other religions andnations until Sabbatian-Frankism spanned the world as it doestoday.Sabbatian Saudis and the terror networkOne expression of the Sabbatian-Frankist Dönmeh within Islam isthe ruling family of Saudi Arabia, the House of Saud, through whichcame the vile distortion of Islam known as Wahhabism. This is theviolent creed followed by terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS orIslamic State. Wahhabism is the hand-chopping, head-chopping‘religion’ of Saudi Arabia which is used to keep the people in aconstant state of fear so the interloper House of Saud can continue torule. Al-Qaeda and Islamic State were lavishly funded by the Houseof Saud while being created and directed by the Sabbatian-Frankistnetwork in the United States that operates through the Pentagon,CIA and the government in general of whichever ‘party’. The frontman for the establishment of Wahhabism in the middle of the 18thcentury was a Sabbatian-Frankist ‘crypto-Jew’ posing as Islamiccalled Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. His daughter would marrythe son of Muhammad bin Saud who established the first Saudi statebefore his death in 1765 with support from the British Empire. BinSaud’s successors would establish modern Saudi Arabia in leaguewith the British and Americans in 1932 which allowed them to seizecontrol of Islam’s major shrines in Mecca and Medina. They havedictated the direction of Sunni Islam ever since while Iran is themajor centre of the Shiite version and here we have the source of atleast the public conflict between them. The Sabbatian network hasused its Wahhabi extremists to carry out Problem-Reaction-Solutionterrorist a\u0000acks in the name of ‘Al-Qaeda’ and ‘Islamic State’ tojustify a devastating ‘war on terror’, ever-increasing surveillance ofthe population and to terrify people into compliance. Anotherinsight of the Renegade Mind is the streetwise understanding that"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"just because a country, location or people are a\u0000acked doesn’t meanthat those apparently representing that country, location or peopleare not behind the a\u0000ackers.

Observe what was justified in the nameof 9/11 alone in terms of Middle East invasions, mass surveillanceand control that fulfilled the demands of the Project for the NewAmerican Century document published by the Sabbatian Neocons.What appear to be enemies are on the deep inside players on thesame Sabbatian team. Israel and Arab ‘royal’ dictatorships are allruled by Sabbatians and the recent peace agreements between Israeland Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and others areonly making formal what has always been the case behind thescenes. Palestinians who have been subjected to grotesque tyrannysince Israel was bombed and terrorised into existence in 1948 havenever stood a chance. Sabbatian-Frankists have controlled Israel (sothe constant theme of violence and war which Sabbatians love) andthey have controlled the Arab countries that Palestinians havelooked to for real support that never comes. ‘Royal families’ of theArab world in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE, etc., are all Sabbatianswith allegiance to the aims of the cult and not what is best for theirArabic populations. They have stolen the oil and financial resourcesfrom their people by false claims to be ‘royal dynasties’ with agenetic right to rule and by employing vicious militaries to imposetheir will.Satanic ‘illumination’The Satanist Jacob Frank formed an alliance in 1773 with two otherSabbatians, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), founder of theRothschild banking dynasty, and Jesuit-educated fraudulent Jew,Adam Weishaupt, and this led to the formation of the BavarianIlluminati, firstly under another name, in 1776. The Illuminati would"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"be the manipulating force behind the French Revolution (1789-1799)and was also involved in the American Revolution (1775-1783)before and a\u0000er the Illuminati’s official creation. Weishaupt wouldlater become (in public) a Protestant Christian in archetypalSabbatian style. I read that his name can be decoded as Adam-Weis-haupt or ‘the first man to lead those who know’. He wasn’t a leaderin the sense that he was a subordinate, but he did lead those belowhim in a crusade of transforming human society that still continuestoday. The theme was confirmed as early as 1785 when a horsemancourier called Lanz was reported to be struck by lighting andextensive Illuminati documents were found in his saddlebags. Theymade the link to Weishaupt and detailed the plan for world takeover.Current events with ‘Covid’ fascism have been in the making for avery long time. Jacob Frank was jailed for 13 years by the CatholicInquisition a\u0000er his arrest in 1760 and on his release he headed forFrankfurt, Germany, home city and headquarters of the House ofRothschild where the alliance was struck with Mayer AmschelRothschild and Weishaupt. Rothschild arranged for Frank to begiven the title of Baron and he became a wealthy nobleman with abig following of Jews in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empireand other European countries. Most of them would have believed hewas on their side.The name ‘Illuminati’ came from the Zohar which is a body ofworks in the Jewish mystical ‘bible’ called the Kabbalah. ‘Zohar’ isthe foundation of Sabbatian-Frankist belief and in Hebrew ‘Zohar’means ‘splendour’, ‘radiance’, ‘illuminated’, and so we have‘Illuminati’. They claim to be the ‘Illuminated Ones’ from theirknowledge systematically hidden from the human population andpassed on through generations of carefully-chosen initiates in theglobal secret society network or Cult. Hidden knowledge includesan awareness of the Cult agenda for the world and the nature of ourcollective reality that I will explore later. Cult ‘illumination’ issymbolised by the torch held by the Statue of Liberty which wasgi\u0000ed to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew exactlywhat it represents. ‘Liberty’ symbolises the goddess worshipped in"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Babylon as Queen Semiramis or Ishtar. The significance of this willbecome clear. Notice again the ubiquitous theme of inversion withthe Statue of ‘Liberty’ really symbolising mass control (Fig 7). Amirror-image statute stands on an island in the River Seine in Parisfrom where New York Liberty originated (Fig 8). A large replica ofthe Liberty flame stands on top of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Pariswhere Princess Diana died in a Cult ritual described in The BiggestSecret. Lucifer ‘the light bringer’ is related to all this (and much moreas we’ll see) and ‘Lucifer’ is a central figure in Sabbatian-Frankismand its associated Satanism. Sabbatians reject the Jewish Torah, orPentateuch, the ‘five books of Moses’ in the Old Testament known asGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy which areclaimed by Judaism and Christianity to have been dictated by ‘God’to Moses on Mount Sinai. Sabbatians say these do not apply to themand they seek to replace them with the Zohar to absorb Judaism andits followers into their inversion which is an expression of a muchgreater global inversion. They want to delete all religions and forcehumanity to worship a one-world religion – Sabbatian Satanism thatalso includes worship of the Earth goddess. Satanic themes are beingmore and more introduced into mainstream society and whileChristianity is currently the foremost target for destruction theothers are planned to follow.Figure 7: The Cult goddess of Babylon disguised as the Statue of Liberty holding the flame ofLucifer the ‘light bringer’."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Figure 8: Liberty’s mirror image in Paris where the New York version originated.Marx brothersRabbi Marvin Antelman connects the Illuminati to the Jacobins in ToEliminate the Opiate and Jacobins were the force behind the FrenchRevolution. He links both to the Bund der Gerechten, or League ofthe Just, which was the network that inflicted communism/Marxismon the world. Antelman wrote:The original inner circle of the Bund der Gerechten consisted of born Catholics, Protestantsand Jews [Sabbatian-Frankist infiltrators], and those representatives of respective subdivisionsformulated schemes for the ultimate destruction of their faiths. The heretical Catholics laidplans which they felt would take a century or more for the ultimate destruction of the church;the apostate Jews for the ultimate destruction of the Jewish religion.Sabbatian-created communism connects into this anti-religionagenda in that communism does not allow for the free practice ofreligion. The Sabbatian ‘Bund’ became the International CommunistParty and Communist League and in 1848 ‘Marxism’ was born withthe Communist Manifesto of Sabbatian assets Karl Marx andFriedrich Engels. It is absolutely no coincidence that Marxism, just adifferent name for fascist and other centrally-controlled tyrannies, isbeing imposed worldwide as a result of the ‘Covid’ hoax and northat Marxist/fascist China was the place where the hoax originated.The reason for this will become very clear in the chapter ‘Covid: Thecalculated catastrophe’.

Marxism is being touted by Wokers as a replacementfor ‘capitalism’ when we don’t have ‘capitalism’. We have cartelismin which the market is stitched up by the very Cult billionaires andcorporations bankrolling Woke. Billionaires love Marxism whichkeeps the people in servitude while they control from the top.Terminally naïve Wokers think they are ‘changing the world’ whenit’s the Cult that is doing the changing and when they have playedtheir vital part and become surplus to requirements they, too, will betargeted. The Illuminati-Jacobins were behind the period known as‘The Terror’ in the French Revolution in 1793 and 1794 when JacobinMaximillian de Robespierre and his Orwellian ‘Commi\u0000ee of PublicSafety’ killed 17,000 ‘enemies of the Revolution’ who had once been‘friends of the Revolution’. Karl Marx (1818-1883), whose Sabbatiancreed of Marxism has cost the lives of at least 100 million people, is ahero once again to Wokers who have been systematically keptignorant of real history by their ‘education’ programming. As aresult they now promote a Sabbatian ‘Marxist’ abomination destinedat some point to consume them. Rabbi Antelman, who spent decadesresearching the Sabbatian plot, said of the League of the Just andKarl Marx:Contrary to popular opinion Karl Marx did not originate the Communist Manifesto. He waspaid for his services by the League of the Just, which was known in its country of origin,Germany, as the Bund der Geaechteten.Antelman said the text a\u0000ributed to Marx was the work of otherpeople and Marx ‘was only repeating what others already said’.Marx was ‘a hired hack – lackey of the wealthy Illuminists’. Marxfamously said that religion was the ‘opium of the people’ (part of theSabbatian plan to demonise religion) and Antelman called his books,To Eliminate the Opiate.

I don’t follow any religion and it has done muchdamage to the world over centuries and acted as a perceptualstraightjacket. Renegade Minds, however, are always asking whysomething is being done. It doesn’t ma\u0000er if they agree or disagreewith what is happening – why is it happening is the question. The‘why?’ can be answered with regard to religion in that religionscreate interacting communities of believers when the Cult wants todismantle all discourse, unity and interaction (see ‘Covid’lockdowns) and the ultimate goal is to delete all religions for a one-world religion of Cult Satanism worshipping their ‘god’ of whichmore later. We see the same ‘why?’ with gun control in America.

Don’t bother telling Quinn and Bland. I don’t want toconfuse them, bless ‘em. One reason I am dubbed ‘anti-Semitic’ isthat I wrote in the 1990s that Jewish operatives (Sabbatians) wereheavily involved in the Russian Revolution when Sabbatiansoverthrew the Romanov dynasty. This apparently made me ‘anti-Semitic’. Oh, really? Here is a section from The Trigger:British journalist Robert Wilton confirmed these themes in his 1920 book The Last Days of theRomanovs when he studied official documents from the Russian government to identify themembers of the Bolshevik ruling elite between 1917 and 1919. The Central Committeeincluded 41 Jews among 62 members; the Council of the People’s Commissars had 17 Jewsout of 22 members; and 458 of the 556 most important Bolshevik positions between 1918 and1919 were occupied by Jewish people. Only 17 were Russian. Then there were the 23 Jewsamong the 36 members of the vicious Cheka Soviet secret police established in 1917 whowould soon appear all across the country.Professor Robert Service of Oxford University, an expert on 20th century Russian history,found evidence that [‘Jewish’] Leon Trotsky had sought to make sure that Jews were enrolledin the Red Army and were disproportionately represented in the Soviet civil bureaucracy thatincluded the Cheka which performed mass arrests, imprisonment and executions of ‘enemiesof the people’.

He wrote in a 1920 edition of the Illustrated Sunday Heraldthat those behind the Russian revolution were part of a ‘worldwideconspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for thereconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, ofenvious malevolence, and impossible equality’ (see ‘Woke’ todaybecause that has been created by the same network).

ThusTchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate, Litvinoff, and theinfluence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power ofTrotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek – allJews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And theprominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by theExtraordinary Commissions for Combatting Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, andin some notable cases by Jewesses.What I said about seriously disproportionate involvement in theRussian Revolution by Jewish ‘revolutionaries’ (Sabbatians) isprovable fact, but truth is no defence against the Sabbatian Anti-Semitism Industry, its repeater parrots like Quinn and Bland, andthe now breathtaking network of so-called ‘Woke’ ‘anti-hate’ groupswith interlocking leaderships and funding which have the role ofdiscrediting and silencing anyone who gets too close to exposing theSabbatians. We have seen ‘truth is no defence’ confirmed in legaljudgements with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission inCanada decreeing this: ‘Truthful statements can be presented in amanner that would meet the definition of hate speech, and not alltruthful statements must be free from restriction.’ Most ‘anti-hate’activists, who are themselves consumed by hatred, are too stupidand ignorant of the world to know how they are being used.

Sabbatian Mayer AmschelRothschild set out to dominate this arena in his family’s quest fortotal global control. What is freedom? It is, in effect, choice. Themore choices you have the freer you are and the fewer your choicesthe more you are enslaved. In the global structure created overcenturies by Sabbatians the biggest decider and restrictor of choice is... money. Across the world if you ask people what they would liketo do with their lives and why they are not doing that they will reply‘I don’t have the money’. This is the idea. A global elite of multi-billionaires are described as ‘greedy’ and that is true on one level;but control of money – who has it and who doesn’t – is not primarilyabout greed. It’s about control. Sabbatians have seized ever morecontrol of finance and sucked the wealth of the world out of thehands of the population. We talk now, a\u0000er all, about the ‘One-percent’ and even then the wealthiest are a lot fewer even than that.This has been made possible by a money scam so outrageous and sovast it could rightly be called the scam of scams founded on creating‘money’ out of nothing and ‘loaning’ that with interest to thepopulation. Money out of nothing is called ‘credit’. Sabbatians haveasserted control over governments and banking ever morecompletely through the centuries and secured financial laws thatallow banks to lend hugely more than they have on deposit in aconfidence trick known as fractional reserve lending. Imagine if youcould lend money that doesn’t exist and charge the recipient interestfor doing so. You would end up in jail. Bankers by contrast end up inmansions, private jets, Malibu and Monaco.Banks are only required to keep a fraction of their deposits andwealth in their vaults and they are allowed to lend ‘money’ theydon’t have called ‘credit.

Credit is backed by nothing exceptwind and only has buying power because people think that it hasbuying power and accept it in return for property, goods andservices. I have described this situation as like those cartooncharacters you see chasing each other and when they run over theedge of a cliff they keep running forward on fresh air until one ofthem looks down, realises what’s happened, and they all crash intothe ravine.

He set out to overcome the best part of 20 othercandidates in the Republican Party before and during the primariesand was not considered by many in those early stages to have aprayer of living in the White House. The Republican Party was saidto have great reservations about Trump and yet somehow he wonthe nomination. When you know how American politics works –politics in general – there is no way that Trump could have becomethe party’s candidate unless the Sabbatian-controlled ‘Neocons’ thatrun the Republican Party wanted that to happen. We saw the proofin emails and documents made public by WikiLeaks that theDemocratic Party hierarchy, or Democons, systematicallyundermined the campaign of Bernie Sanders to make sure thatSabbatian gofer Hillary Clinton won the nomination to be theirpresidential candidate. If the Democons could do that then theNeocons in the Republican Party could have derailed Trump in thesame way. But they didn’t and at that stage I began to conclude thatTrump could well be the one chosen to be president. If that was thecase the ‘why’ was pre\u0000y clear to see – the goal of dividing Americabetween Cult agenda-supporting Wokers and Pushbackers whogravitated to Trump because he was telling them what they wantedto hear. His constituency of support had been increasingly ignoredand voiceless for decades and profoundly through the eight years ofSabbatian puppet Barack Obama. Now here was someone speakingtheir language of pulling back from the incessant globalisation ofpolitical and economic power, the exporting of American jobs toChina and elsewhere by ‘American’ (Sabbatian) corporations, thedeletion of free speech, and the mass immigration policies that hadfurther devastated job opportunities for the urban working class ofall races and the once American heartlands of the Midwest.Beware the forked tongueThose people collectively sighed with relief that at last a politicalleader was apparently on their side, but another trait of theRenegade Mind is that you look even harder at people telling you"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"what you want to hear than those who are telling you otherwise.Obviously as I said earlier people wish what they want to hear to betrue and genuine and they are much more likely to believe that thansomeone saying what they don’t want to here and don’t want to betrue. Sales people are taught to be skilled in eliciting by calculatedquestioning what their customers want to hear and repeating thatback to them as their own opinion to get their targets to like andtrust them. Assets of the Cult are also sales people in the sense ofselling perception. To read Cult manipulation you have to play thelong and expanded game and not fall for the Vaudeville show ofparty politics. Both American parties are vehicles for the Cult andthey exploit them in different ways depending on what the agendarequires at that moment. Trump and the Republicans were used tobe the focus of dividing America and isolating Pushbackers to openthe way for a Biden presidency to become the most extreme inAmerican history by advancing the full-blown Woke (Cult) agendawith the aim of destroying and silencing Pushbackers now labelledNazi Trump supporters and white supremacists.Sabbatians wanted Trump in office for the reasons described byultra-Zionist Saul Alinsky (1909-1972) who was promoting the Wokephilosophy through ‘community organising’ long before anyone hadheard of it. In those days it still went by its traditional name ofMarxism. The reason for the manipulated Trump phenomenon waslaid out in Alinsky’s 1971 book, Rules for Radicals, which was hisblueprint for overthrowing democratic and other regimes andreplacing them with Sabbatian Marxism. Not surprisingly his to-dolist was evident in the Sabbatian French and Russian ‘Revolutions’and that in China which will become very relevant in the nextchapter about the ‘Covid’ hoax. Among Alinsky’s followers havebeen the deeply corrupt Barack Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosiand Hillary Clinton who described him as a ‘hero’. All three areSabbatian stooges with Pelosi personifying the arrogant corruptidiocy that so widely fronts up for the Cult inner core. Predictably asa Sabbatian advocate of the ‘light-bringer’ Alinsky features Luciferon the dedication page of his book as the original radical who gained"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"his own kingdom (‘Earth’ as we shall see). One of Alinsky’s goldenradical rules was to pick an individual and focus all a\u0000ention, hatredand blame on them and not to target faceless bureaucracies andcorporations. Rules for Radicals is really a Sabbatian handbook withits contents repeatedly employed all over the world for centuries andwhy wouldn’t Sabbatians bring to power their designer-villain to beused as the individual on which all a\u0000ention, hatred and blame wasbestowed? This is what they did and the only question for me is howmuch Trump knew that and how much he was manipulated. A bit ofboth, I suspect. This was Alinsky’s Trump technique from a manwho died in 1972. The technique has spanned history:Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it. Don’t try to attack abstract corporations orbureaucracies. Identify a responsible individual. Ignore attempts to shift or spread the blame.From the moment Trump came to illusory power everything wasabout him. It wasn’t about Republican policy or opinion, but allabout Trump. Everything he did was presented in negative,derogatory and abusive terms by the Sabbatian-dominated medialed by Cult operations such as CNN, MSNBC, The New York Timesand the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post – ‘Pick the target, freeze it,personalize it, polarize it.’ Trump was turned into a demon to bevilified by those who hated him and a demi-god loved by those whoworshipped him. This, in turn, had his supporters, too, presented asequally demonic in preparation for the punchline later down the linewhen Biden was about to take office. It was here’s a Trump, there’s aTrump, everywhere a Trump, Trump. Virtually every news story orhappening was filtered through the lens of ‘The Donald’. You lovedhim or hated him and which one you chose was said to define you asSatan’s spawn or a paragon of virtue. Even supporting some Trumppolicies or statements and not others was enough for an assault onyour character. No shades of grey were or are allowed.

The last two were central to the running and protectingfrom collapse of his business empire, the Trump Organisation, andcolossal business failures made him forever beholding to Sabbatiannetworks that bailed him out. By the start of the 1990s Trump owed$4 billion to banks that he couldn’t pay and almost $1billion of thatwas down to him personally and not his companies. This mega-disaster was the result of building two new casinos in Atlantic Cityand buying the enormous Taj Mahal operation which led tocrippling debt payments.

The US Intelligence/Mossad Psyop or psychologicaloperation known as QAnon emerged during the Trump years as acentral pillar in the Sabbatian campaign to lead Pushbackers into thetrap set by those that wished to destroy them.

The central message to Pushbackers in each case isthat they don’t have to do anything because there is ‘a plan’ and it isall going to be sorted by the ‘good guys’ on the inside. ‘Trust theplan’ was a QAnon mantra when the only plan was to misdirectPushbackers into pu\u0000ing their trust in a Psyop they believed to bereal.

Cult corporations likeAmazon and Walmart were naturally considered ‘essential’ whilemom and pop shops and stores had their doors closed by fascistdecree.

A made-up‘virus’ gives you a blank sheet of paper on which you can make it dowhatever you like and have any symptoms or mutant ‘variants’ youchoose to add while a real infectious agent would limit you to whatit actually does. A phantom disease allows you to have endlessludicrous ‘studies’ on the ‘Covid’ dollar to widen the perceivedimpact by inventing ever more ‘at risk’ groups including one studywhich said those who walk slowly may be almost four times morelikely to die from the ‘virus’. People are in psychiatric wards for less.A real ‘deadly bioweapon’ can take out people in the hierarchythat are not part of the Cult, but essential to its operation. Obviouslythey don’t want that. Releasing a real disease means youimmediately lose control of it. Releasing an illusory one means youdon’t. Again it’s vital that people are extra careful when dealing withwhat they want to hear. A bioweapon unleashed from a Chineselaboratory in collusion with the American Deep State may fit aconspiracy narrative, but is it true? Would it not be far more effectiveto use the excuse of a ‘virus’ to justify the real bioweapon – the‘vaccine’? That way your disease agent does not have to betransmi\u0000ed and arrives directly through a syringe. I saw a Frenchvirologist Luc Montagnier quoted in the alternative media as sayinghe had discovered that the alleged ‘new’ severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus , or SARS-CoV-2, was made artificially andincluded elements of the human immunodeficiency ‘virus’ (HIV)and a parasite that causes malaria. SARS-CoV-2 is alleged to triggeran alleged illness called Covid-19. I remembered Montagnier’s namefrom my research years before into claims that an HIV ‘retrovirus’causes AIDs – claims that were demolished by Berkeley virologistPeter Duesberg who showed that no one had ever proved that HIVcauses acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. Claims thatbecome accepted as fact, publicly and medically, with no proofwhatsoever are an ever-recurring story that profoundly applies to"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"‘Covid’. Nevertheless, despite the lack of proof, Montagnier’s teamat the Pasteur Institute in Paris had a long dispute with Americanresearcher Robert Gallo over which of them discovered and isolatedthe HIV ‘virus’ and with no evidence found it to cause AIDS. You willsee later that there is also no evidence that any ‘virus’ causes anydisease or that there is even such a thing as a ‘virus’ in the way it issaid to exist. The claim to have ‘isolated’ the HIV ‘virus’ will bepresented in its real context as we come to the shocking story – andit is a story – of SARS-CoV-2 and so will Montagnier’s assertion thathe identified the full SARS-CoV-2 genome.Hoax in the makingWe can pick up the ‘Covid’ story in 2010 and the publication by theRockefeller Foundation of a document called ‘Scenarios for theFuture of Technology and International Development’. The innercircle of the Rockefeller family has been serving the Cult since JohnD. Rockefeller (1839-1937) made his fortune with Standard Oil. It isless well known that the same Rockefeller – the Bill Gates of his day– was responsible for establishing what is now referred to as ‘BigPharma’, the global network of pharmaceutical companies that makeoutrageous profits dispensing scalpel and drug ‘medicine’ and areobsessed with pumping vaccines in ever-increasing number into asmany human arms and backsides as possible. John D. Rockefellerwas the driving force behind the creation of the ‘education’ systemin the United States and elsewhere specifically designed to programthe perceptions of generations therea\u0000er. The Rockefeller familydonated exceptionally valuable land in New York for the UnitedNations building and were central in establishing the World HealthOrganization in 1948 as an agency of the UN which was createdfrom the start as a Trojan horse and stalking horse for worldgovernment.

The psychopaths can’thandle events where the outcome isn’t certain and as li\u0000le aspossible – preferably nothing – is le\u0000 to chance. Politicians,government and medical officials who would follow direction werebrought to illusory power in advance by the Cult web whether onthe national stage or others like state governors and mayors ofAmerica. For decades the dynamic between officialdom, lawenforcement and the public was changed from one of service to oneof control and dictatorship. Behaviour manipulation networksestablished within government were waiting to impose the coming‘Covid’ rules and regulations specifically designed to subdue andrewire the psyche of the people in the guise of protecting health.These included in the UK the Behavioural Insights Team part-ownedby the British government Cabinet Office; the Scientific PandemicInsights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B); and a whole web ofintelligence and military groups seeking to direct the conversationon social media and control the narrative. Among them are thecyberwarfare (on the people) 77th Brigade of the British militarywhich is also coordinated through the Cabinet Office as civilian andmilitary leadership continues to combine in what they call theFusion Doctrine. The 77th Brigade is a British equivalent of theinfamous Israeli (Sabbatian) military cyberwarfare and Internetmanipulation operation Unit 8200 which I expose at length in TheTrigger.

Through thissimple global communication and enforcement structure the policyof the Cult could be imposed on virtually the entire humanpopulation so long as they acquiesced to the fascism. Witheverything in place it was time for the bu\u0000on to be pressed in late2019/early 2020.These were the prime goals the Cult had to secure for its will toprevail:1) Locking down economies, closing all but designated ‘essential’ businesses (Cult-ownedcorporations were ‘essential’), and pu\u0000ing the population under house arrest was animperative to destroy independent income and employment and ensure dependency on theCult-controlled state in the Hunger Games Society. Lockdowns had to be established as theglobal blueprint from the start to respond to the ‘virus’ and followed by pre\u0000y much theentire world.2) The global population had to be terrified into believing in a deadly ‘virus’ that didn’tactually exist so they would unquestioningly obey authority in the belief that authoritymust know how best to protect them and their families. So\u0000ware salesman Gates wouldsuddenly morph into the world’s health expert and be promoted as such by the Cult-ownedmedia.3) A method of testing that wasn’t testing for the ‘virus’, but was only claimed to be, had tobe in place to provide the illusion of ‘cases’ and subsequent ‘deaths’ that had a verydifferent cause to the ‘Covid-19’ that would be scribbled on the death certificate.4) Because there was no ‘virus’ and the great majority testing positive with a test not testingfor the ‘virus’ would have no symptoms of anything the lie had to be sold that peoplewithout symptoms (without the ‘virus’) could still pass it on to others. This was crucial tojustify for the first time quarantining – house arresting – healthy people. Without this theeconomy-destroying lockdown of everybody could not have been credibly sold.5) The ‘saviour’ had to be seen as a vaccine which beyond evil drug companies wereworking like angels of mercy to develop as quickly as possible, with all corners cut, to savethe day. The public must absolutely not know that the ‘vaccine’ had nothing to do with a‘virus’ or that the contents were ready and waiting with a very different motive long beforethe ‘Covid’ card was even li\u0000ed from the pack.I said in March, 2020, that the ‘vaccine’ would have been createdway ahead of the ‘Covid’ hoax which justified its use and thefollowing December an article in the New York Intelligencermagazine said the Moderna ‘vaccine’ had been ‘designed’ by"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"January, 2020.

The ‘vaccine’ was actually‘designed’ long before that although even with this timescale youwould expect the article to ask how on earth it could have been donethat quickly. Instead it asked why the ‘vaccine’ had not been rolledout then and not months later. Journalism in the mainstream is trulydead.

To use a test that was testing for the ‘virus’ wouldmean that every test would come back negative given there was no‘virus’. They chose to exploit something called the RT-PCR testinvented by American biochemist Kary Mullis in the 1980s who saidpublicly that his PCR test ... cannot detect infectious disease. Yes, the‘test’ used worldwide to detect infectious ‘Covid’ to produce all theillusory ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ compiled by Johns Hopkins and otherscannot detect infectious disease. This fact came from the mouth of theman who invented PCR and was awarded the Nobel Prize inChemistry in 1993 for doing so. Sadly, and incredibly convenientlyfor the Cult, Mullis died in August, 2019, at the age of 74 just beforehis test would be fraudulently used to unleash fascism on the world.He was said to have died from pneumonia which was an irony initself.

He had been seriously critical of theGallo/Montagnier claim to have isolated the HIV ‘virus’ and shownit to cause AIDS for which Mullis said there was no evidence. AIDSis actually not a disease but a series of diseases from which peopledie all the time. When they die from those same diseases a\u0000er apositive ‘test’ for HIV then AIDS goes on their death certificate. Ithink I’ve heard that before somewhere. Countries instigated apolicy with ‘Covid’ that anyone who tested positive with a test nottesting for the ‘virus’ and died of any other cause within 28 days andeven longer ‘Covid-19’ had to go on the death certificate. Cases havecome from the test that can’t test for infectious disease and thedeaths are those who have died of anything a\u0000er testing positivewith a test not testing for the ‘virus’. I’ll have much more later aboutthe death certificate scandal.Mullis was deeply dismissive of the now US ‘Covid’ star AnthonyFauci who he said was a liar who didn’t know anything aboutanything – ‘and I would say that to his face – nothing.’ He said ofFauci: ‘The man thinks he can take a blood sample, put it in anelectron microscope and if it’s got a virus in there you’ll know it – hedoesn’t understand electron microscopy and he doesn’t understandmedicine and shouldn’t be in a position like he’s in.’ That position,terrifyingly, has made him the decider of ‘Covid’ fascism policy onbehalf of the Cult in his role as director since 1984 of the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) while his recordof being wrong is laughable; but being wrong, so long as it’s the rightkind of wrong, is why the Cult loves him.

Lying is inFauci’s DNA. To make the situation crystal clear about the PCR testthis is a direct quote from its inventor Kary Mullis:It > the 3 C5 test@ doesn’t tell you that you’re sick and doesn’t tell you that the thing you endedup with was really going to hurt you ...’Ask yourself why governments and medical systems the world overhave been using this very test to decide who is ‘infected’ with theSARS-CoV-2 ‘virus’ and the alleged disease it allegedly causes,‘Covid-19’.

The process is called‘amplification’ and means that a tiny sample of genetic material isamplified to bring out the detailed content. I stress that it is nottesting for an infectious disease. It is simply amplifying a sample ofgenetic material. In the words of Kary Mullis: ‘PCR is ... just aprocess that’s used to make a whole lot of something out ofsomething.’ To emphasise the point companies that make the PCRtests circulated around the world to ‘test’ for ‘Covid’ warn on thebox that it can’t be used to detect ‘Covid’ or infectious disease and isfor research purposes only. It’s okay, rest for a minute and you’ll befine. This is the test that produces the ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ that havebeen used to destroy human society. All those global and nationalmedical and scientific ‘experts’ demanding this destruction to ‘saveus’ KNOW that the test is not testing for the ‘virus’ and the cases anddeaths they claim to be real are an almost unimaginable fraud. Everyone of them and so many others including politicians andpsychopaths like Gates and Tedros must be brought beforeNuremburg-type trials and jailed for the rest of their lives.

Once theamplification of the PCR reaches a certain level everyone will testpositive. So much of the material has been made sensitive to the testthat everyone will have some part of it in their body. Even lyingcriminals like Fauci have said that once PCR amplifications pass 35cycles everything will be a false positive that cannot be trusted forthe reasons I have described. I say, like many proper doctors andscientists, that 100 percent of the ‘positives’ are false, but let’s just gowith Fauci for a moment.He says that any amplification over 35 cycles will produce falsepositives and yet the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) andFood and Drug Administration (FDA) have recommended up to 40cycles and the National Health Service (NHS) in Britain admi\u0000ed inan internal document for staff that it was using 45 cycles ofamplification. A long list of other countries has been doing the sameand at least one ‘testing’ laboratory has been using 50 cycles.

The ‘test’ comesback ‘positive’ and so you have the ‘virus’, end of story. Now we cansee how the government in Tanzania could send off samples from agoat and a pawpaw fruit under human names and both came backpositive for ‘Covid-19’.

I haveheard of, and from, many people who booked a test, couldn’t turnup, and yet got a positive result through the post for a test they’dnever even had. The whole thing is crazy, but for the Cult there’smethod in the madness. Controlling and manipulating the level ofamplification of the test means the authorities can control wheneverthey want the number of apparent ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’. If they wantto justify more fascist lockdown and destruction of livelihoods theykeep the amplification high. If they want to give the illusion thatlockdowns and the ‘vaccine’ are working then they lower theamplification and ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ will appear to fall. In January,2021, the Cult-owned World Health Organization suddenly warnedlaboratories about over-amplification of the test and to lower thethreshold. Suddenly headlines began appearing such as: ‘Why ARE“Covid” cases plummeting?’ This was just when the vaccine rolloutwas underway and I had predicted months before they would makecases appear to fall through amplification tampering when the‘vaccine’ came.

A nasalswab punctured one woman’s brain and caused it to leak fluid. Mostof these procedures are being done by people with li\u0000le training ormedical knowledge. Dr Lorraine Day, former orthopaedic traumasurgeon and Chief of Orthopaedic Surgery at San Francisco GeneralHospital, says the tests are really a ‘vaccine’. Cows have long beenvaccinated this way. She points out that masks have to cover the noseand the mouth where it is claimed the ‘virus’ exists in saliva. Whythen don’t they take saliva from the mouth as they do with a DNAtest instead of pushing a long swab up the nose towards the brain?The ethmoid bone separates the nasal cavity from the brain andwithin that bone is the cribriform plate. Dr Day says that when theswab is pushed up against this plate and twisted the procedure is‘depositing things back there’. She claims that among these ‘things’are nanoparticles that can enter the brain. Researchers have notedthat a team at the Gates-funded Johns Hopkins have designed tiny,star-shaped micro-devices that can latch onto intestinal mucosa andrelease drugs into the body. Mucosa is the thin skin that covers theinside surface of parts of the body such as the nose and mouth andproduces mucus to protect them. The Johns Hopkins micro-devicesare called ‘theragrippers’ and were ‘inspired’ by a parasitic wormthat digs its sharp teeth into a host’s intestines. Nasal swabs are alsocoated in the sterilisation agent ethylene oxide. The US NationalCancer Institute posts this explanation on its website:At room temperature, ethylene oxide is a flammable colorless gas with a sweet odor. It is usedprimarily to produce other chemicals, including antifree] e. In smaller amounts, ethyleneoxide is used as a pesticide and a sterili] ing agent. The ability of ethylene oxide to damage' NA makes it an effective sterili] ing agent but also accounts for its cancer-causing activity.The Institute mentions lymphoma and leukaemia as cancers mostfrequently reported to be associated with occupational exposure toethylene oxide along with stomach and breast cancers.

They are mostly not physicians or healers, but repeaters ofthe official narrative – or else. I have seen alleged professionaldoctors on British television make shocking statements that we aresupposed to take seriously. One called ‘Dr’ Amir Khan, who isactually telling patients how to respond to illness, said that mencould take the birth pill to ‘help slow down the effects of Covid-19’.In March, 2021, another ridiculous ‘Covid study’ by an Americandoctor proposed injecting men with the female sex hormoneprogesterone as a ‘Covid’ treatment. British doctor Nighat Arif toldthe BBC that face coverings were now going to be part of ongoingnormal. Yes, the vaccine protects you, she said (evidence?) ... but theway to deal with viruses in the community was always going tocome down to hand washing, face covering and keeping a physicaldistance. That’s not what we were told before the ‘vaccine’ wascirculating. Arif said she couldn’t imagine ever again going on theunderground or in a li\u0000 without a mask.

He was feted on television and advised the Germangovernment on ‘Covid’ policy. Most importantly to the wider worldDrosten led a group that produced the ‘Covid’ testing protocol forthe PCR test. What a remarkable feat given the PCR cannot test forinfectious disease and even more so when you think that Drostensaid that his method of testing for SARS-CoV-2 was developed‘without having virus material available’. He developed a test for a‘virus’ that he didn’t have and had never seen. Let that sink in as yousurvey the global devastation that came from what he did. Thewhole catastrophe of Drosten’s ‘test’ was based on the allegedgenetic sequence published by Chinese scientists on the Internet. Wewill see in the next chapter that this alleged ‘genetic sequence’ hasnever been produced by China or anyone and cannot be when thereis no SARS-CoV-2. Drosten, however, doesn’t seem to let li\u0000le detailslike that get in the way. He was the lead author with Victor Cormanfrom the same Charité Hospital of the paper ‘Detection of 2019 novelcoronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time PCR‘ published in a magazinecalled Eurosurveillance. This became known as the Corman-Drostenpaper. In November, 2020, with human society devastated by theeffects of the Corman-Drosten test baloney, the protocol was publiclychallenged by 22 international scientists and independentresearchers from Europe, the United States, and Japan. Among themwere senior molecular geneticists, biochemists, immunologists, andmicrobiologists. They produced a document headed ‘External peerreview of the RTPCR test to detect SARS-Cov-2 Reveals 10 MajorFlaws At The Molecular and Methodological Level: Consequences"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"••••••For False-Positive Results’. The flaws in the Corman-Drosten testincluded the following: The test is non-specific because of erroneous designResults are enormously variableThe test is unable to discriminate between the whole ‘virus’ andviral fragmentsIt doesn’t have positive or negative controlsThe test lacks a standard operating procedureIt is unsupported by proper peer view The scientists said the PCR ‘Covid’ testing protocol was notfounded on science and they demanded the Corman-Drosten paperbe retracted by Eurosurveillance. They said all present and previousCovid deaths, cases, and ‘infection rates’ should be subject to amassive retroactive inquiry. Lockdowns and travel restrictionsshould be reviewed and relaxed and those diagnosed through PCRto have ‘Covid-19’ should not be forced to isolate. Dr Kevin Corbe\u0000,a health researcher and nurse educator with a long academic careerproducing a stream of peer-reviewed publications at many UKuniversities, made the same point about the PCR test debacle. Hesaid of the scientists’ conclusions: ‘Every scientific rationale for thedevelopment of that test has been totally destroyed by this paper. It’slike Hiroshima/Nagasaki to the Covid test.’ He said that Chinahadn’t given them an isolated ‘virus’ when Drosten developed thetest. Instead they had developed the test from a sequence in a genebank.’ Put another way ... they made it up! The scientists weresupported in this contention by a Portuguese appeals court whichruled in November, 2020, that PCR tests are unreliable and it isunlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test. The pointabout China not providing an isolated virus must be true when the‘virus’ has never been isolated to this day and the consequences ofthat will become clear.

In other words there was no peer-reviewfor a test that would be used to decide who had ‘Covid’ and whodidn’t across the world. The Cult-created, Gates-controlled WorldHealth Organization immediately recommended all its nearly 200member countries to use the Drosten PCR protocol to detect ‘cases’and ‘deaths’. The sting was underway and it continues to this day.So who is this Christian Drosten that produced the means throughwhich death, destruction and economic catastrophe would bejustified? His education background, including his doctoral thesis,would appear to be somewhat shrouded in mystery and his trackrecord is dire as with another essential player in the ‘Covid’ hoax,the Gates-funded Professor Neil Ferguson at the Gates-fundedImperial College in London of whom more shortly. Drostenpredicted in 2003 that the alleged original SARS ‘virus’ (SARS-1’)was an epidemic that could have serious effects on economies and aneffective vaccine would take at least two years to produce. Drosten’sanswer to every alleged ‘outbreak’ is a vaccine which you won’t beshocked to know. What followed were just 774 official deathsworldwide and none in Germany where there were only nine cases.That is even if you believe there ever was a SARS ‘virus’ when theevidence is zilch and I will expand on this in the next chapter.Drosten claims to be co-discoverer of ‘SARS-1’ and developed a testfor it in 2003. He was screaming warnings about ‘swine flu’ in 2009and how it was a widespread infection far more severe than anydangers from a vaccine could be and people should get vaccinated. Itwould be helpful for Drosten’s vocal chords if he simply recordedthe words ‘the virus is deadly and you need to get vaccinated’ andcopies could be handed out whenever the latest made-up threatcomes along. Drosten’s swine flu epidemic never happened, but BigPharma didn’t mind with governments spending hundreds ofmillions on vaccines that hardly anyone bothered to use and manywho did wished they hadn’t. A study in 2010 revealed that the riskof dying from swine flu, or H1N1, was no higher than that of theannual seasonal flu which is what at least most of ‘it’ really was as in"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"the case of ‘Covid-19’. A media investigation into Drosten askedhow with such a record of inaccuracy he could be the governmentadviser on these issues. The answer to that question is the same withDrosten, Ferguson and Fauci – they keep on giving the authoritiesthe ‘conclusions’ and ‘advice’ they want to hear. Drosten certainlyproduced the goods for them in January, 2020, with his PCR protocolgarbage and provided the foundation of what German internalmedicine specialist Dr Claus Köhnlein, co-author of Virus Mania,called the ‘test pandemic’. The 22 scientists in the Eurosurveillancechallenge called out conflicts of interest within the Drosten ‘protocol’group and with good reason. Olfert Landt, a regular co-author ofDrosten ‘studies’, owns the biotech company TIB MolbiolSyntheselabor GmbH in Berlin which manufactures and sells thetests that Drosten and his mates come up with. They have done thiswith SARS, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), MERS, Zika ‘virus’,yellow fever, and now ‘Covid’. Landt told the Berliner Zeitungnewspaper:The testing, design and development came from the Charitp > ' rosten and Corman@ . Wesimply implemented it immediately in the form of a kit. And if we don’t have the virus, whichoriginally only existed in Wuhan, we can make a synthetic gene to simulate the genome of thevirus. That’s what we did very quickly.This is more confirmation that the Drosten test was designedwithout access to the ‘virus’ and only a synthetic simulation which iswhat SARS-CoV-2 really is – a computer-generated synthetic fiction.It’s quite an enterprise they have going here. A Drosten team decideswhat the test for something should be and Landt’s biotech companyflogs it to governments and medical systems across the world. Hiscompany must have made an absolute fortune since the ‘Covid’ hoaxbegan.

Remember it’s not about changing‘real’ reality it’s about controlling perception of reality. You don’t haveto make something happen you only have make people believe thatit’s happening. Renegade Minds understand this and are thereforemuch harder to swindle. ‘Covid-19’ is not a ‘real’ ‘virus’. It’s a mindvirus, like a computer virus, which has infected the minds, not thebodies, of billions. It all started, publically at least, in China and thatalone is of central significance. The Cult was behind the revolutionled by its asset Mao Zedong, or Chairman Mao, which establishedthe People’s Republic of China on October 1st, 1949. It should havebeen called The Cult’s Republic of China, but the name had to reflectthe recurring illusion that vicious dictatorships are run by and forthe people (see all the ‘Democratic Republics’ controlled by tyrants).In the same way we have the ‘Biden’ Democratic Republic ofAmerica officially ruled by a puppet tyrant (at least temporarily) onbehalf of Cult tyrants. The creation of Mao’s mercilesscommunist/fascist dictatorship was part of a frenzy of activity by theCult at the conclusion of World War Two which, like the First WorldWar, it had instigated through its assets in Germany, Britain, France,the United States and elsewhere. Israel was formed in 1948; theSoviet Union expanded its ‘Iron Curtain’ control, influence andmilitary power with the Warsaw Pact communist alliance in 1955;the United Nations was formed in 1945 as a Cult precursor to worldgovernment; and a long list of world bodies would be establishedincluding the World Health Organization (1948), World TradeOrganization (1948 under another name until 1995), InternationalMonetary Fund (1945) and World Bank (1944).

Thesedelude the population into believing that countries are ruled withintheir borders by a government of whatever shade when these aremere agencies of a global power. America’s illusion of democracyand China’s communism/fascism are subsidiaries – vehicles – for thesame agenda. We may hear about conflict and competition betweenAmerica and China and on the lower levels that will be true; but atthe Cult level they are branches of the same company in the way ofthe McDonald’s example I gave earlier. I have tracked in the booksover the years support by US governments of both parties forChinese Communist Party infiltration of American society throughallowing the sale of land, even military facilities, and the acquisitionof American business and university influence. All this isunderpinned by the infamous stealing of intellectual property andtechnological know-how. Cult-owned Silicon Valley corporationswaive their fraudulent ‘morality’ to do business with human-rights-free China; Cult-controlled Disney has become China’s PRdepartment; and China in effect owns ‘American’ sports such asbasketball which depends for much of its income on Chineseaudiences.

I will discuss later the common forcebehind all this that has spanned those centuries and thousands ofyears if the truth be told. Instigating the Mao revolution in China in1949 with a 2020 ‘pandemic’ in mind is not only how they work – the71 years between them is really quite short by the Cult’s standards ofmanipulation preparation. The reason for the Cult’s Chineserevolution was to create a fiercely-controlled environment withinwhich an extreme structure for human control could be incubated toeventually be unleashed across the world. We have seen this happensince the ‘pandemic’ emerged from China with the Chinese control-structure founded on AI technology and tyrannical enforcementsweep across the West. Until the moment when the Cult went forbroke in the West and put its fascism on public display Westerngovernments had to pay some lip-service to freedom and democracyto not alert too many people to the tyranny-in-the-making. Freedomswere more subtly eroded and power centralised with covertgovernment structures put in place waiting for the arrival of 2020when that smokescreen of ‘freedom’ could be dispensed with. TheWest was not able to move towards tyranny before 2020 anythinglike as fast as China which was created as a tyranny and had nolimits on how fast it could construct the Cult’s blueprint for globalcontrol.

This is why the Cult-owned, Gates-owned, WHO Director-General Tedros said early on:The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken tocontain the outbreak. China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response and it isnot an exaggeration.Forbes magazine said of China: ‘... those measures protected untoldmillions from ge\u0000ing the disease’. The Rockefeller Foundation‘epidemic scenario’ document in 2010 said ‘prophetically’:However, a few countries did fare better – China in particular. The Chinese government’squick imposition and enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citi] ens, as well as itsinstant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders, saved millions of lives, stopping the spreadof the virus far earlier than in other countries and enabling a swifter post-pandemic recovery.Once again – spooky.The first official story was the ‘bat theory’ or rather the batdiversion. The source of the ‘virus outbreak’ we were told was a‘‘wet market’ in Wuhan where bats and other animals are boughtand eaten in horrifically unhygienic conditions. Then another storyemerged through the alternative media that the ‘virus’ had beenreleased on purpose or by accident from a BSL-4 (biosafety level 4)laboratory in Wuhan not far from the wet market. The lab wasreported to create and work with lethal concoctions andbioweapons. Biosafety level 4 is the highest in the World HealthOrganization system of safety and containment. Renegade Minds areaware of what I call designer manipulation. The ideal for the Cult isfor people to buy its prime narrative which in the opening salvoes ofthe ‘pandemic’ was the wet market story. It knows, however, thatthere is now a considerable worldwide alternative media ofresearchers sceptical of anything governments say and they are o\u0000engiven a version of events in a form they can perceive as crediblewhile misdirecting them from the real truth.

Theinner circle will know where the ‘virus’ came from – nowhere. Thebo\u0000om line was to ensure the public believed there was a ‘virus’ andit didn’t much ma\u0000er if they thought it was natural or had beenreleased from a lab. The belief that there was a ‘deadly virus’ was allthat was needed to trigger global panic and fear. The population wasterrified into handing their power to authority and doing what theywere told. They had to or they were ‘all gonna die’.In March, 2020, information began to come my way from realdoctors and scientists and my own additional research which hadmy intuition screaming: ‘Yes, that’s it! There is no virus.’ The‘bioweapon’ was not the ‘virus’; it was the ‘vaccine’ already beingtalked about that would be the bioweapon. My conclusion wasfurther enhanced by happenings in Wuhan. The ‘virus’ was said tobe sweeping the city and news footage circulated of peoplecollapsing in the street (which they’ve never done in the West withthe same ‘virus’). The Chinese government was building ‘newhospitals’ in a ma\u0000er of ten days to ‘cope with demand’ such was thevirulent nature of the ‘virus’. Yet in what seemed like no time the‘new hospitals’ closed – even if they even opened – and Chinadeclared itself ‘virus-free’. It was back to business as usual.

TheInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in the UnitedStates, another source of outrageously false ‘Covid’ computermodels to justify lockdowns, is bankrolled by Gates who is avehement promotor of lockdowns. America’s version of Whi\u0000y andVallance, the again now infamous Anthony Fauci, has connections to‘Covid vaccine’ maker Moderna as does Bill Gates through fundingfrom the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

DeborahBirx who was appointed White House Coronavirus ResponseCoordinator in February, 2020, is yet another with ties to Gates.Everywhere you look at the different elements around the worldbehind the coordination and decision making of the ‘Covid’ hoaxthere is Bill Gates and his money.

The story was told by PCR inventor Kary Mullis in hisbook Dancing Naked in the Mind Field. He said that in 1984 heaccepted as just another scientific fact that Luc Montagnier ofFrance’s Pasteur Institute and Robert Gallo of America’s NationalInstitutes of Health had independently discovered that a ‘retrovirus’dubbed HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) caused AIDS. They"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"were, a\u0000er all, Mullis writes, specialists in retroviruses. This is howthe medical and science pyramids work. Something is announced orassumed and then becomes an everybody-knows-that purely throughrepetition of the assumption as if it is fact. Complete crap becomesaccepted truth with no supporting evidence and only repetition ofthe crap. This is how a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist became the ‘virus’that changed the world. The HIV-AIDS fairy story became a multi-billion pound industry and the media poured out propagandaterrifying the world about the deadly HIV ‘virus’ that caused thelethal AIDS. By then Mullis was working at a lab in Santa Monica,California, to detect retroviruses with his PCR test in blooddonations received by the Red Cross. In doing so he asked avirologist where he could find a reference for HIV being the cause ofAIDS. ‘You don’t need a reference,’ the virologist said ... ‘Everybodyknows it.’ Mullis said he wanted to quote a reference in the report hewas doing and he said he felt a li\u0000le funny about not knowing thesource of such an important discovery when everyone else seemedto. The virologist suggested he cite a report by the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) on morbidity and mortality.Mullis read the report, but it only said that an organism had beenidentified and did not say how. The report did not identify theoriginal scientific work. Physicians, however, assumed (key recurringtheme) that if the CDC was convinced that HIV caused AIDS thenproof must exist. Mullis continues:I did computer searches. Neither Montagnier, Gallo, nor anyone else had published papersdescribing experiments which led to the conclusion that HIV probably caused AIDS. I readthe papers in Science for which they had become well known as AIDS doctors, but all theyhad said there was that they had found evidence of a past infection by something which wasprobably HIV in some AIDS patients.They found antibodies. Antibodies to viruses had always been considered evidence of pastdisease, not present disease. Antibodies signaled that the virus had been defeated. The patienthad saved himself. There was no indication in these papers that this virus caused a disease.They didn’t show that everybody with the antibodies had the disease. In fact they found somehealthy people with antibodies."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Mullis asked why their work had been published if Montagnierand Gallo hadn’t really found this evidence, and why had they beenfighting so hard to get credit for the discovery? He says he washesitant to write ‘HIV is the probable cause of AIDS’ until he foundpublished evidence to support that. ‘Tens of thousands of scientistsand researchers were spending billions of dollars a year doingresearch based on this idea,’ Mullis writes. ‘The reason had to bethere somewhere; otherwise these people would not have allowedtheir research to se\u0000le into one narrow channel of investigation.’ Hesaid he lectured about PCR at numerous meetings where peoplewere always talking about HIV and he asked them how they knewthat HIV was the cause of AIDS:Everyone said something. Everyone had the answer at home, in the office, in some drawer.They all knew, and they would send me the papers as soon as they got back. But I never gotany papers. Nobody ever sent me the news about how AIDS was caused by HIV.Eventually Mullis was able to ask Montagnier himself about thereference proof when he lectured in San Diego at the grand openingof the University of California AIDS Research Center. Mullis saysthis was the last time he would ask his question without showinganger. Montagnier said he should reference the CDC report. ‘I readit’, Mullis said, and it didn’t answer the question. ‘If Montagnierdidn’t know the answer who the hell did?’ Then one night Mulliswas driving when an interview came on National Public Radio withPeter Duesberg, a prominent virologist at Berkeley and a CaliforniaScientist of the Year. Mullis says he finally understood why he couldnot find references that connected HIV to AIDS – there weren’t any!No one had ever proved that HIV causes AIDS even though it hadspawned a multi-billion pound global industry and the media wasrepeating this as fact every day in their articles and broadcaststerrifying the shit out of people about AIDS and giving theimpression that a positive test for HIV (see ‘Covid’) was a deathsentence. Duesberg was a threat to the AIDS gravy train and theagenda that underpinned it. He was therefore abused and castigateda\u0000er he told the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"there was no good evidence implicating the new ‘virus’. Editorsrejected his manuscripts and his research funds were deleted. Mullispoints out that the CDC has defined AIDS as one of more than 30diseases if accompanied by a positive result on a test that detectsantibodies to HIV; but those same diseases are not defined as AIDScases when antibodies are not detected:If an HIV-positive woman develops uterine cancer, for example, she is considered to haveAIDS. If she is not HIV positive, she simply has uterine cancer. An HIV-positive man withtuberculosis has AIDS; if he tests negative he simply has tuberculosis. If he lives in Kenya orColombia, where the test for HIV antibodies is too expensive, he is simply presumed to havethe antibodies and therefore AIDS, and therefore he can be treated in the World HealthOrganization’s clinic. It’s the only medical help available in some places. And it’s free,because the countries that support WHO are worried about AIDS.Mullis accuses the CDC of continually adding new diseases (see evermore ‘Covid symptoms’) to the grand AIDS definition and ofvirtually doctoring the books to make it appear as if the diseasecontinued to spread. He cites how in 1993 the CDC enormouslybroadened its AIDS definition and county health authorities weredelighted because they received $2,500 per year from the Federalgovernment for every reported AIDS case. Ladies and gentlemen, Ihave just described, via Kary Mullis, the ‘Covid pandemic’ of 2020and beyond. Every element is the same and it’s been pulled off in thesame way by the same networks.The ‘Covid virus’ exists? Okay – prove it. Er ... still waitingWhat Kary Mullis described with regard to ‘HIV’ has been repeatedwith ‘Covid’. A claim is made that a new, or ‘novel’, infection hasbeen found and the entire medical system of the world repeats thatas fact exactly as they did with HIV and AIDS. No one in themainstream asks rather relevant questions such as ‘How do youknow?’ and ‘Where is your proof?’ The SARS-Cov-2 ‘virus’ and the‘Covid-19 disease’ became an overnight ‘everybody-knows-that’.The origin could be debated and mulled over, but what you couldnot suggest was that ‘SARS-Cov-2’ didn’t exist. That would be"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"ridiculous. ‘Everybody knows’ the ‘virus’ exists. Well, I didn’t forone along with American proper doctors like Andrew Kaufman andTom Cowan and long-time American proper journalist JonRappaport. We dared to pursue the obvious and simple question:‘Where’s the evidence?’ The overwhelming majority in medicine,journalism and the general public did not think to ask that. A\u0000er all,everyone knew there was a new ‘virus’. Everyone was saying so and Iheard it on the BBC. Some would eventually argue that the ‘deadlyvirus’ was nothing like as deadly as claimed, but few would ventureinto the realms of its very existence. Had they done so they wouldhave found that the evidence for that claim had gone AWOL as withHIV causes AIDS. In fact, not even that. For something to go AWOLit has to exist in the first place and scientific proof for a ‘SARS-Cov-2’can be filed under nothing, nowhere and zilch.Dr Andrew Kaufman is a board-certified forensic psychiatrist inNew York State, a Doctor of Medicine and former AssistantProfessor and Medical Director of Psychiatry at SUNY UpstateMedical University, and Medical Instructor of Hematology andOncology at the Medical School of South Carolina.

Kaufman isnot only a forensic psychiatrist; he is forensic in all that he does.

They hadnever – from the start – shown it to exist and every repeat of thisclaim worldwide was based on the accepted existence of proof thatwas nowhere to be found – see Kary Mullis and HIV. Here we goagain.Let’s postulateKaufman discovered that the Chinese authorities immediatelyconcluded that the cause of an illness that broke out among about200 initial patients in Wuhan was a ‘new virus’ when there were nogrounds to make that conclusion. The alleged ‘virus’ was notisolated from other genetic material in their samples and then shownthrough a system known as Koch’s postulates to be the causativeagent of the illness. The world was told that the SARS-Cov-2 ‘virus’caused a disease they called ‘Covid-19’ which had ‘flu-like’symptoms and could lead to respiratory problems and pneumonia.If it wasn’t so tragic it would almost be funny. ‘Flu-like’ symptoms’?Pneumonia? Respiratory disease? What in CHINA and particularly inWuhan, one of the most polluted cities in the world with a resultingepidemic of respiratory disease?? Three hundred thousand peopleget pneumonia in China every year and there are nearly a billioncases worldwide of ‘flu-like symptoms’. These have a whole range ofcauses – including pollution in Wuhan – but no other possibility wascredibly considered in late 2019 when the world was told there was anew and deadly ‘virus’. The global prevalence of pneumonia and‘flu-like systems’ gave the Cult networks unlimited potential to re-diagnose these other causes as the mythical ‘Covid-19’ and that iswhat they did from the very start. Kaufman revealed how Chinesemedical and science authorities (all subordinates to the Cult-ownedcommunist government) took genetic material from the lungs ofonly a few of the first patients. The material contained their owncells, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms living in their bodies.The only way you could prove the existence of the ‘virus’ and itsresponsibility for the alleged ‘Covid-19’ was to isolate the virus fromall the other material – a process also known as ‘purification’ – and"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"then follow the postulates sequence developed in the late 19thcentury by German physician and bacteriologist Robert Koch whichbecame the ‘gold standard’ for connecting an alleged causationagent to a disease:1. The microorganism (bacteria, fungus, virus, etc.) must be present in every case of thedisease and all patients must have the same symptoms. It must also not be present in healthyindividuals.2. The microorganism must be isolated from the host with the disease. If the microorganismis a bacteria or fungus it must be grown in a pure culture. If it is a virus, it must be purified(i.e. containing no other material except the virus particles) from a clinical sample.3. The specific disease, with all of its characteristics, must be reproduced when theinfectious agent (the purified virus or a pure culture of bacteria or fungi) is inoculated into ahealthy, susceptible host.4. The microorganism must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host as in step2.Not one of these criteria has been met in the case of ‘SARS-Cov-2’ and‘Covid-19’. Not ONE. EVER. Robert Koch refers to bacteria and notviruses. What are called ‘viral particles’ are so minute (hence masksare useless by any definition) that they could only be seen a\u0000er theinvention of the electron microscope in the 1930s and can still onlybe observed through that means. American bacteriologist andvirologist Thomas Milton Rivers, the so-called ‘Father of ModernVirology’ who was very significantly director of the RockefellerInstitute for Medical Research in the 1930s, developed a lessstringent version of Koch’s postulates to identify ‘virus’ causationknown as ‘Rivers criteria’. ‘Covid’ did not pass that process either.Some even doubt whether any ‘virus’ can be isolated from otherparticles containing genetic material in the Koch method. Freedomof Information requests in many countries asking for scientific proofthat the ‘Covid virus’ has been purified and isolated and shown toexist have all come back with a ‘we don’t have that’ and when thishappened with a request to the UK Department of Health theyadded this comment:"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"However, outside of the scope of the [Freedom of Information Act] and on a discretionarybasis, the following information has been advised to us, which may be of interest. Mostinfectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Some bacteria or fungi have thecapacity to grow on their own in isolation, for example in colonies on a petri dish. Viruses aredifferent in that they are what we call ‘obligate pathogens’ – that is, they cannot survive orreproduce without infecting a host ...... For some diseases, it is possible to establish causation between a microorganism and adisease by isolating the pathogen from a patient, growing it in pure culture and reintroducingit to a healthy organism. These are known as ‘Koch’s postulates’ and were developed in 1882.However, as our understanding of disease and different disease-causing agents has advanced,these are no longer the method for determining causation [Andrew Kaufman asks why in thatcase are there two published articles falsely claiming to satisfy Koch’s postulates].It has long been known that viral diseases cannot be identified in this way as viruses cannotbe grown in ‘pure culture’. When a patient is tested for a viral illness, this is normally done bylooking for the presence of antigens, or viral genetic code in a host with molecular biologytechniques [Kaufman asks how you could know the origin of these chemicals without havinga pure culture for comparison].For the record ‘antigens’ are defined so:Invading microorganisms have antigens on their surface that the human body can recognise asbeing foreign – meaning not belonging to it. When the body recognises a foreign antigen,lymphocytes (white blood cells) produce antibodies, which are complementary in shape tothe antigen.Notwithstanding that this is open to question in relation to ‘SARS-Cov-2’ the presence of ‘antibodies’ can have many causes and theyare found in people that are perfectly well. Kary Mullis said:‘Antibodies ... had always been considered evidence of past disease,not present disease.’‘Covid’ really is a computer ‘virus’Where the UK Department of Health statement says ‘viruses’ arenow ‘diagnosed’ through a ‘viral genetic code in a host withmolecular biology techniques’, they mean ... the PCR test which itsinventor said cannot test for infectious disease. They have nocredible method of connecting a ‘virus’ to a disease and we will seethat there is no scientific proof that any ‘virus’ causes any disease orthere is any such thing as a ‘virus’ in the way that it is described.Tenacious Canadian researcher Christine Massey and her team made"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"some 40 Freedom of Information requests to national public healthagencies in different countries asking for proof that SARS-CoV-2 hasbeen isolated and not one of them could supply that information.Massey said of her request in Canada: ‘Freedom of Informationreveals Public Health Agency of Canada has no record of ‘SARS-COV-2’ isolation performed by anyone, anywhere, ever.’ If youaccept the comment from the UK Department of Health it’s becausethey can’t isolate a ‘virus’. Even so many ‘science’ papers claimed tohave isolated the ‘Covid virus’ until they were questioned and hadto admit they hadn’t. A reply from the Robert Koch Institute inGermany was typical: ‘I am not aware of a paper which purifiedisolated SARS-CoV-2.’ So what the hell was Christian Drosten andhis gang using to design the ‘Covid’ testing protocol that hasproduced all the illusory Covid’ cases and ‘Covid’ deaths when thehead of the Chinese version of the CDC admi\u0000ed there was aproblem right from the start in that the ‘virus’ had never beenisolated/purified? Breathe deeply: What they are calling ‘Covid’ isactually created by a computer program i.e. they made it up – er, that’sit. They took lung fluid, with many sources of genetic material, fromone single person alleged to be infected with Covid-19 by a PCR testwhich they claimed, without clear evidence, contained a ‘virus’. Theyused several computer programs to create a model of a theoreticalvirus genome sequence from more than fi\u0000y-six million smallsequences of RNA, each of an unknown source, assembling themlike a puzzle with no known solution. The computer filled in thegaps with sequences from bits in the gene bank to make it look like abat SARS-like coronavirus! A wave of the magic wand and poof, anin silico (computer-generated) genome, a scientific fantasy, wascreated. UK health researcher Dr Kevin Corbe\u0000 made the same pointwith this analogy:... It’s like giving you a few bones and saying that’s your fish. It could be any fish. Not even askeleton. Here’s a few fragments of bones. That’s your fish ... It’s all from gene bank and thebits of the virus sequence that weren’t there they made up.They synthetically created them to fill in the blanks. That’s what genetics is; it’s a code. So it’sABBBCCDDD and you’re missing some what you think is EEE so you put it in. It’s all"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"synthetic. You just manufacture the bits that are missing. This is the end result of thegeneticization of virology. This is basically a computer virus.Further confirmation came in an email exchange between Britishcitizen journalist Frances Leader and the government’s Medicines &Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the Gates-funded MHRA)which gave emergency permission for untested ‘Covid vaccines’ tobe used. The agency admi\u0000ed that the ‘vaccine’ is not based on anisolated ‘virus’, but comes from a computer-generated model. FrancesLeader was naturally banned from Cult-owned fascist Twi\u0000er formaking this exchange public. The process of creating computer-generated alleged ‘viruses’ is called ‘in silico’ or ‘in silicon’ –computer chips – and the term ‘in silico’ is believed to originate withbiological experiments using only a computer in 1989. ‘Vaccines’involved with ‘Covid’ are also produced ‘in silico’ or by computernot a natural process. If the original ‘virus’ is nothing more than amade-up computer model how can there be ‘new variants’ ofsomething that never existed in the first place? They are not new‘variants’; they are new computer models only minutely different tothe original program and designed to further terrify the populationinto having the ‘vaccine’ and submi\u0000ing to fascism. You want a ‘newvariant’? Click, click, enter – there you go. Tell the medicalprofession that you have discovered a ‘South African variant’, ‘UKvariants’ or a ‘Brazilian variant’ and in the usual HIV-causes-AIDSmanner they will unquestioningly repeat it with no evidencewhatsoever to support these claims. They will go on television andwarn about the dangers of ‘new variants’ while doing nothing morethan repeating what they have been told to be true and knowing thatany deviation from that would be career suicide. Big-time insiderswill know it’s a hoax, but much of the medical community is cluelessabout the way they are being played and themselves play the publicwithout even being aware they are doing so. What an interesting‘coincidence’ that AstraZeneca and Oxford University wereconducting ‘Covid vaccine trials’ in the three countries – the UK,South Africa and Brazil – where the first three ‘variants’ wereclaimed to have ‘broken out’."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Here’s your ‘virus’ – it’s a unicornDr Andrew Kaufman presented a brilliant analysis describing howthe ‘virus’ was imagined into fake existence when he dissected anarticle published by Nature and wri\u0000en by 19 authors detailingalleged ‘sequencing of a complete viral genome’ of the ‘new SARS-CoV-2 virus’. This computer-modelled in silico genome was used as atemplate for all subsequent genome sequencing experiments thatresulted in the so-called variants which he said now number morethan 6,000. The fake genome was constructed from more than 56million individual short strands of RNA. Those li\u0000le pieces wereassembled into longer pieces by finding areas of overlappingsequences. The computer programs created over two millionpossible combinations from which the authors simply chose thelongest one. They then compared this to a ‘bat virus’ and thecomputer ‘alignment’ rearranged the sequence and filled in the gaps!They called this computer-generated abomination the ‘completegenome’. Dr Tom Cowan, a fellow medical author and collaboratorwith Kaufman, said such computer-generation constitutes scientificfraud and he makes this superb analogy:Here is an equivalency: A group of researchers claim to have found a unicorn because theyfound a piece of a hoof, a hair from a tail, and a snippet of a horn. They then add thatinformation into a computer and program it to re-create the unicorn, and they then claim thiscomputer re-creation is the real unicorn. Of course, they had never actually seen a unicorn socould not possibly have examined its genetic makeup to compare their samples with theactual unicorn’s hair, hooves and horn.The researchers claim they decided which is the real genome of SARS-CoV-2 by ‘consensus’,sort of like a vote. Again, different computer programs will come up with different versions ofthe imaginary ‘unicorn’, so they come together as a group and decide which is the realimaginary unicorn.This is how the ‘virus’ that has transformed the world was broughtinto fraudulent ‘existence’. Extraordinary, yes, but as the Nazis saidthe bigger the lie the more will believe it. Cowan, however, wasn’tfinished and he went on to identify what he called the realblockbuster in the paper. He quotes this section from a paper wri\u0000en"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"by virologists and published by the CDC and then explains what itmeans:Therefore, we examined the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in severalcommon primate and human cell lines, including human adenocarcinoma cells (A549),human liver cells (HUH 7.0), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). In addition toVero E6 and Vero CCL81 cells. ... Each cell line was inoculated at high multiplicity ofinfection and examined 24h post-infection.No CPE was observed in any of the cell lines except in Vero cells, which grew to greater than10 to the 7th power at 24 h post-infection. In contrast, HUH 7.0 and 293T showed onlymodest viral replication, and A549 cells were incompatible with SARS CoV-2 infection.Cowan explains that when virologists a\u0000empt to prove infectionthey have three possible ‘hosts’ or models on which they can test.The first was humans. Exposure to humans was generally not donefor ethical reasons and has never been done with SARS-CoV-2 or anycoronavirus. The second possible host was animals. Cowan said thatforge\u0000ing for a moment that they never actually use purified viruswhen exposing animals they do use solutions that they claim containthe virus. Exposure to animals has been done with SARS-CoV-2 inan experiment involving mice and this is what they found: None ofthe wild (normal) mice got sick. In a group of genetically-modifiedmice, a statistically insignificant number lost weight and had slightlybristled fur, but they experienced nothing like the illness called‘Covid-19’. Cowan said the third method – the one they mostly relyon – is to inoculate solutions they say contain the virus onto a varietyof tissue cultures. This process had never been shown to kill tissueunless the sample material was starved of nutrients and poisoned aspart of the process. Yes, incredibly, in tissue experiments designed toshow the ‘virus’ is responsible for killing the tissue they starve thetissue of nutrients and add toxic drugs including antibiotics and theydo not have control studies to see if it’s the starvation and poisoningthat is degrading the tissue rather than the ‘virus’ they allege to be inthere somewhere. You want me to pinch you? Yep, I understand.Tom Cowan said this about the whole nonsensical farce as heexplains what that quote from the CDC paper really means:"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"The shocking thing about the above quote is that using their own methods, the virologistsfound that solutions containing SARS-CoV-2 – even in high amounts – were NOT, I repeatNOT, infective to any of the three human tissue cultures they tested. In plain English, thismeans they proved, on their terms, that this ‘new coronavirus’ is not infectious to humanbeings. It is ONLY infective to monkey kidney cells, and only then when you add two potentdrugs (gentamicin and amphotericin), known to be toxic to kidneys, to the mix.My friends, read this again and again. These virologists, published by the CDC, performed aclear proof, on their terms, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is harmless to human beings.That is the only possible conclusion, but, unfortunately, this result is not even mentioned intheir conclusion. They simply say they can provide virus stocks cultured only on monkey Verocells, thanks for coming.Cowan concluded: ‘If people really understood how this “science”was done, I would hope they would storm the gates and demandhonesty, transparency and truth.’ Dr Michael Yeadon, former VicePresident and Chief Scientific Adviser at drug giant Pfizer has been avocal critic of the ‘Covid vaccine’ and its potential for multiple harm.He said in an interview in April, 2021, that ‘not one [vaccine] has thevirus. He was asked why vaccines normally using a ‘dead’ version ofa disease to activate the immune system were not used for ‘Covid’and instead we had the synthetic methods of the ‘mRNA Covidvaccine’. Yeadon said that to do the former ‘you’d have to have someof [the virus] wouldn’t you?’ He added: ‘No-one’s got any –seriously.’ Yeadon said that surely they couldn’t have fooled thewhole world for a year without having a virus, ‘but oddly enoughask around – no one’s got it’. He didn’t know why with all the ‘greatlabs’ around the world that the virus had not been isolated – ‘Maybethey’ve been too busy running bad PCR tests and vaccines thatpeople don’t need.’ What is today called ‘science’ is not ‘science’ atall. Science is no longer what is, but whatever people can bemanipulated to believe that it is. Real science has been hijacked by theCult to dispense and produce the ‘expert scientists’ and contentionsthat suit the agenda of the Cult. How big-time this has happenedwith the ‘Covid’ hoax which is entirely based on fake sciencedelivered by fake ‘scientists’ and fake ‘doctors’.

But, don’t worry, it’s all just acoincidence and absolutely nothing to worry about. Zzzzzzzz.What is a ‘virus’ REALLY?Dr Tom Cowan is one of many contesting the very existence ofviruses let alone that they cause disease. This is understandablewhen there is no scientific evidence for a disease-causing ‘virus’.German virologist Dr Stefan Lanka won a landmark case in 2017 inthe German Supreme Court over his contention that there is no suchthing as a measles virus. He had offered a big prize for anyone whocould prove there is and Lanka won his case when someone soughtto claim the money. There is currently a prize of more than 225,000euros on offer from an Isolate Truth Fund for anyone who can provethe isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic substance. Lanka wrotein an article headed ‘The Misconception Called Virus’ that scientiststhink a ‘virus’ is causing tissue to become diseased and degradedwhen in fact it is the processes they are using which do that – not a‘virus’. Lanka has done an important job in making this point clearas Cowan did in his analysis of the CDC paper. Lanka says that allclaims about viruses as disease-causing pathogens are wrong andbased on ‘easily recognisable, understandable and verifiablemisinterpretations.’ Scientists believed they were working with‘viruses’ in their laboratories when they were really working with‘typical particles of specific dying tissues or cells ...’ Lanka said thatthe tissue decaying process claimed to be caused by a ‘virus’ stillhappens when no alleged ‘virus’ is involved. It’s the process that doesthe damage and not a ‘virus’. The genetic sample is deprived ofnutrients, removed from its energy supply through removal fromthe body and then doused in toxic antibiotics to remove any bacteria.He confirms again that establishment scientists do not (pinch me)"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"conduct control experiments to see if this is the case and if they didthey would see the claims that ‘viruses’ are doing the damage isnonsense. He adds that during the measles ‘virus’ court case hecommissioned an independent laboratory to perform just such acontrol experiment and the result was that the tissues and cells diedin the exact same way as with alleged ‘infected’ material. This issupported by a gathering number of scientists, doctors andresearchers who reject what is called ‘germ theory’ or the belief inthe body being infected by contagious sources emi\u0000ed by otherpeople. Researchers Dawn Lester and David Parker take the samestance in their highly-detailed and sourced book What Really MakesYou Ill – Why everything you thought you knew about disease is wrongwhich was recommended to me by a number of medicalprofessionals genuinely seeking the truth. Lester and Parker saythere is no provable scientific evidence to show that a ‘virus’ can betransmi\u0000ed between people or people and animals or animals andpeople:The definition also claims that viruses are the cause of many diseases, as if this has beendefinitively proven. But this is not the case; there is no original scientific evidence thatdefinitively demonstrates that any virus is the cause of any disease. The burden of proof forany theory lies with those who proposed it; but none of the existing documents provides‘proof’ that supports the claim that ‘viruses’ are pathogens.Dr Tom Cowan employs one of his clever analogies to describe theprocess by which a ‘virus’ is named as the culprit for a disease whenwhat is called a ‘virus’ is only material released by cells detoxingthemselves from infiltration by chemical or radiation poisoning. Thetidal wave of technologically-generated radiation in the ‘smart’modern world plus all the toxic food and drink are causing this tohappen more than ever. Deluded ‘scientists’ misread this as agathering impact of what they wrongly label ‘viruses’.Paper can infect housesCowan said in an article for davidicke.com – with his tongue onlymildly in his cheek – that he believed he had made a tremendous"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"discovery that may revolutionise science. He had discovered thatsmall bits of paper are alive, ‘well alive-ish’, can ‘infect’ houses, andthen reproduce themselves inside the house. The result was that thisexplosion of growth in the paper inside the house causes the houseto explode, blowing it to smithereens. His evidence for this newtheory is that in the past months he had carefully examined many ofthe houses in his neighbourhood and found almost no scraps ofpaper on the lawns and surrounds of the house. There was anoccasional stray label, but nothing more. Then he would return tothese same houses a week or so later and with a few, not all of them,particularly the old and decrepit ones, he found to his shock andsurprise they were li\u0000ered with stray bits of paper. He knew thenthat the paper had infected these houses, made copies of itself, andblew up the house. A young boy on a bicycle at one of the sites toldhim he had seen a demolition crew using dynamite to explode thehouse the previous week, but Cowan dismissed this as the idlethoughts of silly boys because ‘I was on to something big’. He wason to how ‘scientists’ mistake genetic material in the detoxifyingprocess for something they call a ‘virus’. Cowan said of his houseand paper story:If this sounds crazy to you, it’s because it should. This scenario is obviously nuts. But considerthis admittedly embellished, for effect, current viral theory that all scientists, medical doctorsand virologists currently believe.He takes the example of the ‘novel SARS-Cov2’ virus to prove thepoint. First they take someone with an undefined illness called‘Covid-19’ and don’t even a\u0000empt to find any virus in their sputum.Never mind the scientists still describe how this ‘virus’, which theyhave not located a\u0000aches to a cell receptor, injects its geneticmaterial, in ‘Covid’s’ case, RNA, into the cell. The RNA once insertedexploits the cell to reproduce itself and makes ‘thousands, naymillions, of copies of itself ... Then it emerges victorious to claim itsnext victim’:"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"If you were to look in the scientific literature for proof, actual scientific proof, that uniformSARS-CoV2 viruses have been properly isolated from the sputum of a sick person, that actualspike proteins could be seen protruding from the virus (which has not been found), you wouldfind that such evidence doesn’t exist.If you go looking in the published scientific literature for actual pictures, proof, that thesespike proteins or any viral proteins are ever attached to any receptor embedded in any cellmembrane, you would also find that no such evidence exists. If you were to look for a videoor documented evidence of the intact virus injecting its genetic material into the body of thecell, reproducing itself and then emerging victorious by budding off the cell membrane, youwould find that no such evidence exists.The closest thing you would find is electron micrograph pictures of cellular particles, possiblyattached to cell debris, both of which to be seen were stained by heavy metals, a process thatcompletely distorts their architecture within the living organism. This is like finding bits ofpaper stuck to the blown-up bricks, thereby proving the paper emerged by taking pieces of thebricks on its way out.The Enders baloneyCowan describes the ‘Covid’ story as being just as make-believe ashis paper story and he charts back this fantasy to a Nobel Prizewinner called John Enders (1897-1985), an American biomedicalscientist who has been dubbed ‘The Father of Modern Vaccines’.Enders is claimed to have ‘discovered’ the process of the viralculture which ‘proved’ that a ‘virus’ caused measles. Cowanexplains how Enders did this ‘by using the EXACT same procedurethat has been followed by every virologist to find and characterizeevery new virus since 1954’. Enders took throat swabs from childrenwith measles and immersed them in 2ml of milk. Penicillin (100u/ml)and the antibiotic streptomycin (50,g/ml) were added and the wholemix was centrifuged – rotated at high speed to separate large cellulardebris from small particles and molecules as with milk and cream,for example. Cowan says that if the aim is to find li\u0000le particles ofgenetic material (‘viruses’) in the snot from children with measles itwould seem that the last thing you would do is mix the snot withother material – milk –that also has genetic material. ‘How are youever going to know whether whatever you found came from the snotor the milk?’ He points out that streptomycin is a ‘nephrotoxic’ orpoisonous-to-the-kidney drug. You will see the relevance of that"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"shortly. Cowan says that it gets worse, much worse, when Endersdescribes the culture medium upon which the virus ‘grows’: ‘Theculture medium consisted of bovine amniotic fluid (90%), beefembryo extract (5%), horse serum (5%), antibiotics and phenol red asan indicator of cell metabolism.’ Cowan asks incredulously: ‘Did hejust say that the culture medium also contained fluids and tissuesthat are themselves rich sources of genetic material?’ The geneticcocktail, or ‘medium’, is inoculated onto tissue and cells from rhesusmonkey kidney tissue. This is where the importance of streptomycincomes in and currently-used antimicrobials and other drugs that arepoisonous to kidneys and used in ALL modern viral cultures (e.g.gentamicin, streptomycin, and amphotericin). Cowan asks: ‘How areyou ever going to know from this witch’s brew where any geneticmaterial comes from as we now have five different sources of richgenetic material in our mix?’ Remember, he says, that all geneticmaterial, whether from monkey kidney tissues, bovine serum, milk,etc., is made from the exact same components. The same centralquestion returns: ‘How are you possibly going to know that it wasthe virus that killed the kidney tissue and not the toxic antibiotic andstarvation rations on which you are growing the tissue?’ John Endersanswered the question himself – you can’t:A second agent was obtained from an uninoculated culture of monkey kidney cells. Thecytopathic changes [death of the cells] it induced in the unstained preparations could not bedistinguished with confidence from the viruses isolated from measles.The death of the cells (‘cytopathic changes’) happened in exactlythe same manner, whether they inoculated the kidney tissue with themeasles snot or not, Cowan says. ‘This is evidence that thedestruction of the tissue, the very proof of viral causation of illness,was not caused by anything in the snot because they saw the samedestructive effect when the snot was not even used ... the cytopathic,i.e., cell-killing, changes come from the process of the culture itself,not from any virus in any snot, period.’ Enders quotes in his 1957paper a virologist called Ruckle as reporting similar findings ‘and inaddition has isolated an agent from monkey kidney tissue that is so"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"far indistinguishable from human measles virus’. In other words,Cowan says, these particles called ‘measles viruses’ are simply andclearly breakdown products of the starved and poisoned tissue. Formeasles ‘virus’ see all ‘viruses’ including the so-called ‘Covid virus’.Enders, the ‘Father of Modern Vaccines’, also said:There is a potential risk in employing cultures of primate cells for the production of vaccinescomposed of attenuated virus, since the presence of other agents possibly latent in primatetissues cannot be definitely excluded by any known method.Cowan further quotes from a paper published in the journalViruses in May, 2020, while the ‘Covid pandemic’ was wellunderway in the media if not in reality. ‘EVs’ here refers to particlesof genetic debris from our own tissues, such as exosomes of whichmore in a moment: ‘The remarkable resemblance between EVs andviruses has caused quite a few problems in the studies focused onthe analysis of EVs released during viral infections.’ Later the paperadds that to date a reliable method that can actually guarantee acomplete separation (of EVs from viruses) DOES NOT EXIST. Thiswas published at a time when a fairy tale ‘virus’ was claimed in totalcertainty to be causing a fairy tale ‘viral disease’ called ‘Covid-19’ – afairy tale that was already well on the way to transforming humansociety in the image that the Cult has worked to achieve for so long.Cowan concludes his article:To summarize, there is no scientific evidence that pathogenic viruses exist. What we think ofas ‘viruses’ are simply the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues and cells.When we are well, we make fewer of these particles; when we are starved, poisoned,suffocated by wearing masks, or afraid, we make more.There is no engineered virus circulating and making people sick. People in laboratories allover the world are making genetically modified products to make people sick. These arecalled vaccines. There is no virome, no ‘ecosystem’ of viruses, viruses are not 8%, 50% or100 % of our genetic material. These are all simply erroneous ideas based on themisconception called a virus.What is ‘Covid’?

These arereleased by cells when in states of toxicity – see the same themesreturning over and over. They are released ever more profusely aschemical and radiation toxicity increases and think of the potentialeffect therefore of 5G alone as its destructive frequencies infest thehuman energetic information field with a gathering pace (5G wentonline in Wuhan in 2019 as the ‘virus’ emerged). I’ll have more aboutthis later. Exosomes transmit a warning to the rest of the body that‘Houston, we have a problem’. Kaufman presented images ofexosomes and compared them with ‘Covid’ under an electronmicroscope and the similarity was remarkable. They both a\u0000ach tothe same cell receptors (claimed in the case of ‘Covid’), contain thesame genetic material in the form of RNA or ribonucleic acid, andboth are found in ‘viral cell cultures’ with damaged or dying cells.James Hildreth MD, President and Chief Executive Officer of theMeharry Medical College at Johns Hopkins, said: ‘The virus is fullyan exosome in every sense of the word.’ Kaufman’s conclusion wasthat there is no ‘virus’: ‘This entire pandemic is a completelymanufactured crisis ... there is no evidence of anyone dying from[this] illness.’ Dr Tom Cowan and Sally Fallon Morell, authors of TheContagion Myth, published a statement with Dr Kaufman inFebruary, 2021, explaining why the ‘virus’ does not exist and you canread it that in full in the Appendix.‘Virus’ theory can be traced to the ‘cell theory’ in 1858 of Germanphysician Rudolf Virchow (1821-1920) who contended that diseaseoriginates from a single cell infiltrated by a ‘virus’. Dr Stefan Lankasaid that findings and insights with respect to the structure, functionand central importance of tissues in the creation of life, which werealready known in 1858, comprehensively refute the cell theory.Virchow ignored them.

Dr Tom Cowan’s view is that ill-heath iscaused by too much of something, too li\u0000le of something, ortoxification from chemicals and radiation – not contagion. We mustalso highlight as a major source of the ‘virus’ theology a man stillcalled the ‘Father of Modern Virology’ – Thomas Milton Rivers(1888-1962). There is no way given the Cult’s long game policy that itwas a coincidence for the ‘Father of Modern Virology’ to be directorof the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1937 to 1956when he is credited with making the Rockefeller Institute a leader in‘viral research’.

We were shown images of Chinesepeople collapsing in the street which never happened in the Westwith what was supposed to be the same condition. In the earliestdays when alleged cases and deaths were few the fear register washysterical in many areas of the media and this would expand intothe common media narrative across the world. The real story wasrather different, but we were never told that. The Chinesegovernment, one of the Cult’s biggest centres of global operation,said they had discovered a new illness with flu-like and pneumonia-type symptoms in a city with such toxic air that it is overwhelmedwith flu-like symptoms, pneumonia and respiratory disease. Chinesescientists said it was a new – ‘novel’ – coronavirus which they calledSars-Cov-2 and that it caused a disease they labelled ‘Covid-19’.There was no evidence for this and the ‘virus’ has never to this daybeen isolated, purified and its genetic code established from that. It"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"was from the beginning a computer-generated fiction. Stories ofChinese whistleblowers saying the number of deaths was beingsupressed or that the ‘new disease’ was related to the Wuhan bio-labmisdirected mainstream and alternative media into cul-de-sacs toobscure the real truth – there was no ‘virus’.Chinese scientists took genetic material from the lung fluid of justa few people and said they had found a ‘new’ disease when thismaterial had a wide range of content. There was no evidence for a‘virus’ for the very reasons explained in the last two chapters. The‘virus’ has never been shown to (a) exist and (b) cause any disease.People were diagnosed on symptoms that are so widespread inWuhan and polluted China and with a PCR test that can’t detectinfectious disease. On this farce the whole global scam was sold tothe rest of the world which would also diagnose respiratory diseaseas ‘Covid-19’ from symptoms alone or with a PCR test not testing fora ‘virus’. Flu miraculously disappeared worldwide in 2020 and into2021 as it was redesignated ‘Covid-19’. It was really the same old fluwith its ‘flu-like’ symptoms a\u0000ributed to ‘flu-like’ ‘Covid-19’. At thesame time with very few exceptions the Chinese response ofdraconian lockdown and fascism was the chosen weapon to respondacross the West as recommended by the Cult-owned Tedros at theCult-owned World Health Organization run by the Cult-ownedGates. All was going according to plan. Chinese scientists –everything in China is controlled by the Cult-owned government –compared their contaminated RNA lung-fluid material with otherRNA sequences and said it appeared to be just under 80 percentidentical to the SARS-CoV-1 ‘virus’ claimed to be the cause of theSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) ‘outbreak’ in 2003. Theydecreed that because of this the ‘new virus’ had to be related andthey called it SARS-CoV-2. There are some serious problems withthis assumption and assumption was all it was. Most ‘factual’ scienceturns out to be assumptions repeated into everyone-knows-that. Amatch of under 80-percent is meaningless. Dr Kaufman makes thepoint that there’s a 96 percent genetic correlation between humansand chimpanzees, but ‘no one would say our genetic material is part"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"of the chimpanzee family’. Yet the Chinese authorities were claimingthat a much lower percentage, less than 80 percent, proved theexistence of a new ‘coronavirus’. For goodness sake human DNA is60 percent similar to a banana.You are feeling sleepyThe entire ‘Covid’ hoax is a global Psyop, a psychological operationto program the human mind into believing and fearing a completefantasy. A crucial aspect of this was what appeared to happen in Italy.It was all very well streaming out daily images of an allegedcatastrophe in Wuhan, but to the Western mind it was still on theother side of the world in a very different culture and se\u0000ing. Areaction of ‘this could happen to me and my family’ was still nothinglike as intense enough for the mind-doctors. The Cult needed aWestern example to push people over that edge and it chose Italy,one of its major global locations going back to the Roman Empire.An Italian ‘Covid’ crisis was manufactured in a particular area calledLombardy which just happens to be notorious for its toxic air andtherefore respiratory disease. Wuhan, China, déjà vu. An hystericalmedia told horror stories of Italians dying from ‘Covid’ in theirdroves and how Lombardy hospitals were being overrun by a tidalwave of desperately ill people needing treatment a\u0000er being struckdown by the ‘deadly virus’. Here was the psychological turningpoint the Cult had planned. Wow, if this is happening in Italy, theWestern mind concluded, this indeed could happen to me and myfamily. Another point is that Italian authorities responded byfollowing the Chinese blueprint so vehemently recommended by theCult-owned World Health Organization. They imposed fascisticlockdowns on the whole country viciously policed with the help ofsurveillance drones sweeping through the streets seeking out anyonewho escaped from mass house arrest. Livelihoods were destroyedand psychology unravelled in the way we have witnessed since in alllockdown countries. Crucial to the plan was that Italy responded inthis way to set the precedent of suspending freedom and imposingfascism in a ‘Western liberal democracy’. I emphasised in an"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"animated video explanation on davidicke.com posted in the summerof 2020 how important it was to the Cult to expand the Chineselockdown model across the West. Without this, and the bare-faced liethat non-symptomatic people could still transmit a ‘disease’ theydidn’t have, there was no way locking down the whole population,sick and not sick, could be pulled off. At just the right time and withno evidence Cult operatives and gofers claimed that people withoutsymptoms could pass on the ‘disease’. In the name of protecting the‘vulnerable’ like elderly people, who lockdowns would kill by thetens of thousands, we had for the first time healthy people told toisolate as well as the sick. The great majority of people who testedpositive had no symptoms because there was nothing wrong withthem. It was just a trick made possible by a test not testing for the‘virus’.Months a\u0000er my animated video the Gates-funded Professor NeilFerguson at the Gates-funded Imperial College confirmed that I wasright. He didn’t say it in those terms, naturally, but he did say it.Ferguson will enter the story shortly for his outrageously crazy‘computer models’ that led to Britain, the United States and manyother countries following the Chinese and now Italian methods ofresponse. Put another way, following the Cult script. Ferguson saidthat SAGE, the UK government’s scientific advisory group which hascontrolled ‘Covid’ policy from the start, wanted to follow theChinese lockdown model (while they all continued to work and bepaid), but they wondered if they could possibly, in Ferguson’swords, ‘get away with it in Europe’. ‘Get away with it’? Who the helldo these moronic, arrogant people think they are? This appallingman Ferguson said that once Italy went into national lockdown theyrealised they, too, could mimic China:It’s a communist one-party state, we said. We couldn’t get away with it in Europe, we thought... and then Italy did it. And we realised we could. Behind this garbage from Ferguson is asimple fact: Doing the same as China in every country was the plan from the start andFerguson’s ‘models’ would play a central role in achieving that.

Italian authoritiesrevealed that 99 percent of those who had ‘died from Covid-19’ inItaly had one, two, three, or more ‘co-morbidities’ or illnesses andhealth problems that could have ended their life. The US Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a figure of 94percent for Americans dying of ‘Covid’ while having other seriousmedical conditions – on average two to three (some five or six) otherpotential causes of death. In terms of death from an unproven ‘virus’I say it is 100 percent. The other one percent in Italy and six percentin the US would presumably have died from ‘Covid’s’ flu-likesymptoms with a range of other possible causes in conjunction witha test not testing for the ‘virus’. Fox News reported that even morestartling figures had emerged in one US county in which 410 of 422deaths a\u0000ributed to ‘Covid-19’ had other potentially deadly healthconditions. The Italian National Health Institute said later that theaverage age of people dying with a ‘Covid-19’ diagnosis in Italy wasabout 81. Ninety percent were over 70 with ten percent over 90. Interms of other reasons to die some 80 percent had two or morechronic diseases with half having three or more includingcardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer.Why is the phantom ‘Covid-19’ said to kill overwhelmingly oldpeople and hardly affect the young?

No wonder Professor Walter Ricciardi, scientific advisor to theItalian minister of health, said a\u0000er the Lombardy hysteria had doneits job that ‘Covid’ death rates were due to Italy having the secondoldest population in the world and to how hospitals record deaths:The way in which we code deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all thepeople who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the coronavirus.On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificateshave shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have diedhave at least one pre-morbidity – many had two or three.This is extraordinary enough when you consider the propagandacampaign to use Italy to terrify the world, but how can they even saytwelve percent were genuine when the ‘virus’ has not been shown toexist, its ‘code’ is a computer program, and diagnosis comes from atest not testing for it?

He said there were noreliable tests for a specific ‘Covid-19 virus’ and nor were there anyreliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual‘Covid-19’ cases. We have seen in the long period since then that hewas absolutely right. ‘Every action and reaction to Covid-19 is basedon totally flawed data and we simply cannot make accurateassessments,’ he said. Most people diagnosed with ‘Covid-19’ wereshowing nothing more than cold and flu-like symptoms ‘becausemost coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu-likesymptoms’. We had farcical situations like an 84-year-old Germanman testing positive for ‘Covid-19’ and his nursing home ordered toquarantine only for him to be found to have a common cold. Thescientist described back then why PCR tests and what he called the‘Mickey Mouse test kits’ were useless for what they were claimed tobe identifying. ‘The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus likeCovid-19 is nonsense,’ he said. Significantly, he pointed out that ‘ifyou want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic– pick a coronavirus’. This is exactly what the Cult-owned Gates,World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University did withtheir Event 201 ‘simulation’ followed by their real-life simulationcalled the ‘pandemic’. The scientist said that all you had to do wasselect the sickest of people with respiratory-type diseases in a singlelocation – ‘say Wuhan’ – and administer PCR tests to them. You canthen claim that anyone showing ‘viral sequences’ similar to acoronavirus ‘which will inevitably be quite a few’ is suffering from a‘new’ disease:Since you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will goon to die. You can then say this ‘new’ virus has a CFR [case fatality rate] higher than the fluand use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more‘cases’, which expands the testing, which produces yet more ‘cases’ and so on and so on.Before long you have your ‘pandemic’, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick toconvert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn’t ACTUALLY EXIST[my emphasis].He said that you then ‘just run the same scam in other countries’and make sure to keep the fear message running high ‘so that people"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"•••will feel panicky and less able to think critically’. The only problemto overcome was the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen andonly regular sick people. This meant that deaths from the ‘newdeadly pathogen’ were going to be way too low for a real newdeadly virus pandemic, but he said this could be overcome in thefollowing ways – all of which would go on to happen:1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent [you underpin thiswith fantasy ‘computer projections’]. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and thenclaim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.2. You can [say that people] ‘minimizing’ the dangers are irresponsible and bully them intonot talking about numbers.3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds ofcoronavirus [RNA] in them) and thus inflate your ‘case figures’ with ‘asymptomaticcarriers’ (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologistknows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen).The scientist said that if you take these simple steps ‘you can haveyour own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running inweeks’. His analysis made so early in the hoax was brilliantlyprophetic of what would actually unfold. Pulling all the informationtogether in these recent chapters we have this is simple 1, 2, 3, ofhow you can delude virtually the entire human population intobelieving in a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist: A ‘Covid case’ is someone who tests positive with a test nottesting for the ‘virus’. A ‘Covid death’ is someone who dies of any cause within 28 days(or much longer) of testing positive with a test not testing for the‘virus. Asymptomatic means there is nothing wrong with you, but theyclaim you can pass on what you don’t have to justify locking"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"down (quarantining) healthy people in totality. The foundations of the hoax are that simple. A study involving tenmillion people in Wuhan, published in November, 2020, demolishedthe whole lie about those without symptoms passing on the ‘virus’.They found ‘300 asymptomatic cases’ and traced their contacts tofind that not one of them was detected with the ‘virus’.‘Asymptomatic’ patients and their contacts were isolated for no lessthan two weeks and nothing changed. I know it’s all crap, but if youare going to claim that those without symptoms can transmit ‘thevirus’ then you must produce evidence for that and they never have.Even World Health Organization official Dr Maria Van Kerkhove,head of the emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said as early asJune, 2020, that she doubted the validity of asymptomatictransmission. She said that ‘from the data we have, it still seems tobe rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to asecondary individual’ and by ‘rare’ she meant that she couldn’t citeany case of asymptomatic transmission.The Ferguson factorThe problem for the Cult as it headed into March, 2020, when thescript had lockdown due to start, was that despite all themanipulation of the case and death figures they still did not haveenough people alleged to have died from ‘Covid’ to justify masshouse arrest. This was overcome in the way the scientist described:‘You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths areimminent ... Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and thenclaim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.’ Enterone Professor Neil Ferguson, the Gates-funded ‘epidemiologist’ atthe Gates-funded Imperial College in London. Ferguson is Britain’sChristian Drosten in that he has a dire record of predicting healthoutcomes, but is still called upon to advise government on the nexthealth outcome when another ‘crisis’ comes along.

Ah, but it makes sense from the Cult point ofview. These ‘experts’ keep on producing predictions that suit theCult agenda for societal transformation and so it was with NeilFerguson as he revealed his horrific (and clearly insane) computermodel predictions that allowed lockdowns to be imposed in Britain,the United States and many other countries. Ferguson does not haveeven an A-level in biology and would appear to have no formaltraining in computer modelling, medicine or epidemiology,according to Derek Winton, an MSc in Computational Intelligence.He wrote an article somewhat aghast at what Ferguson did whichincluded taking no account of respiratory disease ‘seasonality’ whichmeans it is far worse in the winter months. Who would have thoughtthat respiratory disease could be worse in the winter? Well, certainlynot Ferguson.The massively China-connected Imperial College and its bizarreprofessor provided the excuse for the long-incubated Chinese modelof human control to travel westward at lightning speed. ImperialCollege confirms on its website that it collaborates with the ChineseResearch Institute; publishes more than 600 research papers everyyear with Chinese research institutions; has 225 Chinese staff; 2,600Chinese students – the biggest international group; 7,000 formerstudents living in China which is the largest group outside the UK;and was selected for a tour by China’s President Xi Jinping duringhis state visit to the UK in 2015. The college takes major donationsfrom China and describes itself as the UK’s number one universitycollaborator with Chinese research institutions. The Chinacommunist/fascist government did not appear phased by the woefulpredictions of Ferguson and Imperial when during the lockdownthat Ferguson induced the college signed a five-year collaborationdeal with China tech giant Huawei that will have Huawei’s indoor5G network equipment installed at the college’s West London techcampus along with an ‘AI cloud platform’. The deal includes Chinesesponsorship of Imperial’s Venture Catalyst entrepreneurshipcompetition.

Up to 200academics from more than a dozen UK universities are beinginvestigated on suspicion of ‘unintentionally’ helping the Chinesegovernment build weapons of mass destruction by ‘transferringworld-leading research in advanced military technology such asaircra\u0000, missile designs and cyberweapons’. Similar scandals havebroken in the United States, but it’s all a coincidence. ImperialCollege serves the agenda in many other ways including thepromotion of every aspect of the United Nations Agenda 21/2030(the Great Reset) and produced computer models to show thathuman-caused ‘climate change’ is happening when in the real worldit isn’t. Imperial College is driving the climate agenda as it drives the‘Covid’ agenda (both Cult hoaxes) while Patrick Vallance, the UKgovernment’s Chief Scientific Adviser on ‘Covid’, was named ChiefScientific Adviser to the UN ‘climate change’ conference known asCOP26 hosted by the government in Glasgow, Scotland. ‘Covid’ and‘climate’ are fundamentally connected.Professor WoefulFrom Imperial’s bosom came Neil Ferguson still advisinggovernment despite his previous disasters and it was announcedearly on that he and other key people like UK Chief Medical AdviserChris Whi\u0000y had caught the ‘virus’ as the propaganda story wasbeing sold. Somehow they managed to survive and we had PrimeMinister Boris Johnson admi\u0000ed to hospital with what was said to bea severe version of the ‘virus’ in this same period. His whole policyand demeanour changed when he returned to Downing Street. It’s asmall world with these government advisors – especially in theircommunal connections to Gates – and Ferguson had partnered withWhi\u0000y to write a paper called ‘Infectious disease: Tough choices toreduce Ebola transmission’ which involved another scare-story thatdidn’t happen. Ferguson’s ‘models’ predicted that up to150, 000could die from ‘mad cow disease’, or BSE, and its version in sheep ifit was transmi\u0000ed to humans. BSE was not transmi\u0000ed and insteadtriggered by an organophosphate pesticide used to treat a pest on"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"cows. Fewer than 200 deaths followed from the human form. Modelsby Ferguson and his fellow incompetents led to the unnecessaryculling of millions of pigs, ca\u0000le and sheep in the foot and mouthoutbreak in 2001 which destroyed the lives and livelihoods offarmers and their families who had o\u0000en spent decades buildingtheir herds and flocks. Vast numbers of these animals did not havefoot and mouth and had no contact with the infection. Another‘expert’ behind the cull was Professor Roy Anderson, a computermodeller at Imperial College specialising in the epidemiology ofhuman, not animal, disease. Anderson has served on the Bill andMelinda Gates Grand Challenges in Global Health advisory boardand chairs another Gates-funded organisation. Gates is everywhere.In a precursor to the ‘Covid’ script Ferguson backed closingschools ‘for prolonged periods’ over the swine flu ‘pandemic’ in 2009and said it would affect a third of the world population if itcontinued to spread at the speed he claimed to be happening. Hismates at Imperial College said much the same and a news reportsaid: ‘One of the authors, the epidemiologist and disease modellerNeil Ferguson, who sits on the World Health Organisation’semergency commi\u0000ee for the outbreak, said the virus had “fullpandemic potential”.’ Professor Liam Donaldson, the Chris Whi\u0000yof his day as Chief Medical Officer, said the worst case could see 30percent of the British people infected by swine flu with 65,000 dying.Ferguson and Donaldson were indeed proved correct when at theend of the year the number of deaths a\u0000ributed to swine flu was 392.The term ‘expert’ is rather liberally applied unfortunately, not leastto complete idiots. Swine flu ‘projections’ were great forGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as millions rolled in for its Pandemrixinfluenza vaccine which led to brain damage with children mostaffected. The British government (taxpayers) paid out more than £60million in compensation a\u0000er GSK was given immunity fromprosecution. Yet another ‘Covid’ déjà vu. Swine flu was supposed tohave broken out in Mexico, but Dr Wolfgang Wodarg, a Germandoctor, former member of parliament and critic of the ‘Covid’ hoax,observed ‘the spread of swine flu’ in Mexico City at the time. He"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"said: ‘What we experienced in Mexico City was a very mild fluwhich did not kill more than usual – which killed even fewer peoplethan usual.’ Hyping the fear against all the facts is not unique to‘Covid’ and has happened many times before. Ferguson is reportedto have over-estimated the projected death toll of bird flu (H5N1) bysome three million-fold, but bird flu vaccine makers again made akilling from the scare. This is some of the background to the NeilFerguson who produced the perfectly-timed computer models inearly 2020 predicting that half a million people would die in Britainwithout draconian lockdown and 2.2 million in the United States.Politicians panicked, people panicked, and lockdowns of allegedshort duration were instigated to ‘fla\u0000en the curve’ of cases gleanedfrom a test not testing for the ‘virus’. I said at the time that the publiccould forget the ‘short duration’ bit. This was an agenda to destroythe livelihoods of the population and force them into mass controlthrough dependency and there was going to be nothing ‘short’ aboutit. American researcher Daniel Horowitz described the consequencesof the ‘models’ spewed out by Gates-funded Ferguson and ImperialCollege:What led our government and the governments of many other countries into panic was asingle Imperial College of UK study, funded by global warming activists, that predicted 2.2million deaths if we didn’t lock down the country. In addition, the reported 8-9% death rate inItaly scared us into thinking there was some other mutation of this virus that they got, whichmight have come here.Together with the fact that we were finally testing and had the ability to actually report newcases, we thought we were headed for a death spiral. But again ... we can’t flatten a curve ifwe don’t know when the curve started.How about it never started?Giving them what they wantAn investigation by German news outlet Welt Am Sonntag (World onSunday) revealed how in March, 2020, the German governmentgathered together ‘leading scientists from several research institutesand universities’ and ‘together, they were to produce a [modelling]"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"paper that would serve as legitimization for further tough politicalmeasures’. The Cult agenda was justified by computer modelling notbased on evidence or reality; it was specifically constructed to justifythe Cult demand for lockdowns all over the world to destroy theindependent livelihoods of the global population. All thesemodellers and everyone responsible for the ‘Covid’ hoax have a datewith a trial like those in Nuremberg a\u0000er World War Two whenNazis faced the consequences of their war crimes. These corrupt-beyond-belief ‘modellers’ wrote the paper according to governmentinstructions and it said that that if lockdown measures were li\u0000edthen up to one million Germans would die from ‘Covid-19’ addingthat some would die ‘agonizingly at home, gasping for breath’unable to be treated by hospitals that couldn’t cope. All lies. Noma\u0000er – it gave the Cult all that it wanted. What did long-timegovernment ‘modeller’ Neil Ferguson say? If the UK and the UnitedStates didn’t lockdown half a million would die in Britain and 2.2million Americans. Anyone see a theme here? ‘Modellers’ are such acrucial part of the lockdown strategy that we should look into theirbackground and follow the money. Researcher Rosemary Freiproduced an excellent article headlined ‘The Modelling-paperMafiosi’. She highlights a guy called John Edmunds, a Britishepidemiologist, and professor in the Faculty of Epidemiology andPopulation Health at the London School of Hygiene & TropicalMedicine. He studied at Imperial College. Edmunds is a member ofgovernment ‘Covid’ advisory bodies which have been dictatingpolicy, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats AdvisoryGroup (NERVTAG) and the Scientific Advisory Group forEmergencies (SAGE).Ferguson, another member of NERVTAG and SAGE, led the waywith the original ‘virus’ and Edmunds has followed in the ‘variant’stage and especially the so-called UK or Kent variant known as the‘Variant of Concern’ (VOC) B.1.1.7. He said in a co-wri\u0000en report forthe Centre for Mathematical modelling of Infectious Diseases at theLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with input fromthe Centre’s ‘Covid-19’ Working Group, that there was ‘a realistic"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"possibility that VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk ofdeath compared to non-VOC viruses’. Fear, fear, fear, get thevaccine, fear, fear, fear, get the vaccine. Rosemary Frei reveals thatalmost all the paper’s authors and members of the modelling centre’s‘Covid-19’ Working Group receive funding from the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation and/or the associated Gates-fundedWellcome Trust. The paper was published by e-journal Medr χivwhich only publishes papers not peer-reviewed and the journal wasestablished by an organisation headed by Facebook’s MarkZuckerberg and his missus. What a small world it is. Frei discoveredthat Edmunds is on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Coalition forEpidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) which was establishedby the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Klaus Schwab’s DavosWorld Economic Forum and Big Pharma giant Wellcome. CEPI was‘launched in Davos [in 2017] to develop vaccines to stop futureepidemics’, according to its website. ‘Our mission is to accelerate thedevelopment of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases andenable equitable access to these vaccines for people duringoutbreaks.’ What kind people they are. Rosemary Frei reveals thatPublic Health England (PHE) director Susan Hopkins is an author ofher organisation’s non-peer-reviewed reports on ‘new variants’.Hopkins is a professor of infectious diseases at London’s ImperialCollege which is gi\u0000ed tens of millions of dollars a year by the Billand Melinda Gates Foundation.

Edmunds said inJanuary, 2021, that to ease lockdowns too soon would be a disasterand they had to ‘vaccinate much, much, much more widely than the"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"elderly’. Rosemary Frei highlights that Edmunds is married toJeanne Pimenta who is described in a LinkedIn profile as director ofepidemiology at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and she held shares in thecompany. Patrick Vallance, co-chair of SAGE and the government’sChief Scientific Adviser, is a former executive of GSK and has adeferred bonus of shares in the company worth £600,000. GSK hasserious business connections with Bill Gates and is collaboratingwith mRNA-’vaccine’ company CureVac to make ‘vaccines’ for thenew variants that Edmunds is talking about. GSK is planning a‘Covid vaccine’ with drug giant Sanofi. Puppet Prime Minister BorisJohnson announced in the spring of 2021 that up to 60 millionvaccine doses were to be made at the GSK facility at Barnard Castlein the English North East. Barnard Castle, with a population of just6,000, was famously visited in breach of lockdown rules in April,2020, by Johnson aide Dominic Cummings who said that he drovethere ‘to test his eyesight’ before driving back to London. Cummingswould be be\u0000er advised to test his integrity – not that it would takelong. The GSK facility had nothing to do with his visit then althoughI’m sure Patrick Vallance would have been happy to arrange anintroduction and some tea and biscuits. Ruthless psychopath Gateshas made yet another fortune from vaccines in collaboration with BigPharma companies and gushes at the phenomenal profits to be madefrom vaccines – more than a 20-to-1 return as he told oneinterviewer. Gates also tweeted in December, 2019, with theforeknowledge of what was coming: ‘What’s next for ourfoundation? I’m particularly excited about what the next year couldmean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines.’Modeller John Edmunds is a big promotor of vaccines as all thesepeople appear to be. He’s the dean of the London School of Hygiene& Tropical Medicine’s Faculty of Epidemiology and PopulationHealth which is primarily funded by the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation and the Gates-established and funded GAVI vaccinealliance which is the Gates vehicle to vaccinate the world. Theorganisation Doctors Without Borders has described GAVI as being‘aimed more at supporting drug-industry desires to promote new"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"products than at finding the most efficient and sustainable means forfighting the diseases of poverty’. But then that’s why the psychopathGates created it. John Edmunds said in a video that the LondonSchool of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is involved in every aspect ofvaccine development including large-scale clinical trials. Hecontends that mathematical modelling can show that vaccinesprotect individuals and society. That’s on the basis of shit in and shitout, I take it. Edmunds serves on the UK Vaccine Network as doesFerguson and the government’s foremost ‘Covid’ adviser, the grim-faced, dark-eyed Chris Whi\u0000y. The Vaccine Network says it works‘to support the government to identify and shortlist targetedinvestment opportunities for the most promising vaccines andvaccine technologies that will help combat infectious diseases withepidemic potential, and to address structural issues related to theUK’s broader vaccine infrastructure’. Ferguson is acting Director ofthe Imperial College Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium whichhas funding from the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation and theGates-created GAVI ‘vaccine alliance’. Anyone wonder why thesecharacters see vaccines as the answer to every problem? Ferguson iswildly enthusiastic in his support for GAVI’s campaign to vaccinechildren en masse in poor countries. You would expect someone likeGates who has constantly talked about the need to reduce thepopulation to want to fund vaccines to keep more people alive. I’msure that’s why he does it. The John Edmunds London School ofHygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) has a VaccinesManufacturing Innovation Centre which develops, tests andcommercialises vaccines. Rosemary Frei writes:The vaccines centre also performs affiliated activities like combating ‘vaccine hesitancy’. Thelatter includes the Vaccine Confidence Project. The project’s stated purpose is, among otherthings, ‘to provide analysis and guidance for early response and engagement with the publicto ensure sustained confidence in vaccines and immunisation’. The Vaccine ConfidenceProject’s director is LSHTM professor Heidi Larson. For more than a decade she’s beenresearching how to combat vaccine hesitancy.How the bloody hell can blokes like John Edmunds and NeilFerguson with those connections and financial ties model ‘virus’ case"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"and death projections for the government and especially in a waythat gives their paymasters like Gates exactly what they want?

The 4 nations public health HCID group made aninterim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID. This was basedon consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with informationavailable during the early stages of the outbreak.Now that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have reviewedthe most up to date information about COVID-19 against the UK HCID criteria. They havedetermined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information isavailable about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and aspecific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase. TheAdvisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) is also of the opinion that COVID-19should no longer be classified as an HCID.Soon a\u0000er the government had been exposed for downgrading therisk they upgraded it again and everyone was back to singing fromthe same Cult hymn book. Ferguson and his fellow Gates clonesindicated that lockdowns and restrictions would have to continueuntil a Gates-funded vaccine was developed. Gates said the samebecause Ferguson and his like were repeating the Gates script whichis the Cult script. ‘Fla\u0000en the curve’ became an ongoing nightmare ofcontinuing lockdowns with periods in between of severe restrictionsin pursuit of destroying independent incomes and had nothing to dowith protecting health about which the Cult gives not a shit.

To compound the human catastrophe thatFerguson’s ‘models’ did so much to create he was later exposed forbreaking his own lockdown rules by having sexual liaisons with hismarried girlfriend Antonia Staats at his home while she was living atanother location with her husband and children. Staats was a‘climate’ activist and senior campaigner at the Soros-funded Avaazwhich I wouldn’t trust to tell me that grass is green. Ferguson had toresign as a government advisor over this hypocrisy in May, 2020, buta\u0000er a period of quiet he was back being quoted by the ridiculousmedia on the need for more lockdowns and a vaccine rollout. Othergovernment-advising ‘scientists’ from Imperial College’ held the fortin his absence and said lockdown could be indefinite until a vaccinewas found. The Cult script was being sung by the payrolled choir. Isaid there was no intention of going back to ‘normal’ when the‘vaccine’ came because the ‘vaccine’ is part of a very different agendathat I will discuss in Human 2.0. Why would the Cult want to let theworld go back to normal when destroying that normal forever wasthe whole point of what was happening? House arrest, closingbusinesses and schools through lockdown, (un)social distancing andmasks all followed the Ferguson fantasy models. Again as Ipredicted (these people are so predictable) when the ‘vaccine’arrived we were told that house arrest, lockdown, (un)socialdistancing and masks would still have to continue. I will deal withthe masks in the next chapter because they are of fundamentalimportance.Where’s the ‘pandemic’?Any mildly in-depth assessment of the figures revealed what wasreally going on. Cult-funded and controlled organisations still havegenuine people working within them such is the number involved.So it is with Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of theApplied Economics master’s degree program at Johns Hopkins"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"University. She analysed the impact that ‘Covid-19’ had on deathsfrom all causes in the United States using official data from the CDCfor the period from early February to early September, 2020. Shefound that allegedly ‘Covid’ related-deaths exceeded those fromheart disease which she found strange with heart disease always thebiggest cause of fatalities. Her research became even more significantwhen she noted the sudden decline in 2020 of all non-’Covid’ deaths:‘This trend is completely contrary to the pa\u0000ern observed in allprevious years ... the total decrease in deaths by other causes almostexactly equals the increase in deaths by Covid-19.’ This was such agame, set and match in terms of what was happening that JohnsHopkins University deleted the article on the grounds that it ‘wasbeing used to support false and dangerous inaccuracies about theimpact of the pandemic’. No – because it exposed the scam fromofficial CDC figures and this was confirmed when those figures werepublished in January, 2021. Here we can see the effect of peopledying from heart a\u0000acks, cancer, road accidents and gunshotwounds – anything – having ‘Covid-19’ on the death certificate alongwith those diagnosed from ‘symptoms’ who had even not testedpositive with a test not testing for the ‘virus’. I am not kidding withthe gunshot wounds, by the way. Brenda Bock, coroner in GrandCounty, Colorado, revealed that two gunshot victims tested positivefor the ‘virus’ within the previous 30 days and were thereforeclassified as ‘Covid deaths’. Bock said: ‘These two people had testedpositive for Covid, but that’s not what killed them. A gunshotwound is what killed them.’ She said she had not even finished herinvestigation when the state listed the gunshot victims as deaths dueto the ‘virus’. The death and case figures for ‘Covid-19’ are anabsolute joke and yet they are repeated like parrots by the media,politicians and alleged medical ‘experts’. The official Cult narrativeis the only show in town.Genevieve Briand found that deaths from all causes were notexceptional in 2020 compared with previous years and a Spanishmagazine published figures that said the same about Spain whichwas a ‘Covid’ propaganda hotspot at one point. Discovery Salud, a"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"health and medicine magazine, quoted government figures whichshowed how 17,000 fewer people died in Spain in 2020 than in 2019and more than 26,000 fewer than in 2018. The age-standardisedmortality rate for England and Wales when age distribution is takeninto account was significantly lower in 2020 than the 1970s, 80s and90s, and was only the ninth highest since 2000. Where is the‘pandemic’?Post mortems and autopsies virtually disappeared for ‘Covid’deaths amid claims that ‘virus-infected’ bodily fluids posed a risk tothose carrying out the autopsy. This was rejected by renownedGerman pathologist and forensic doctor Klaus Püschel who said thathe and his staff had by then done 150 autopsies on ‘Covid’ patientswith no problems at all. He said they were needed to know whysome ‘Covid’ patients suffered blood clots and not severe respiratoryinfections. The ‘virus’ is, a\u0000er all, called SARS or ‘severe acuterespiratory syndrome’. I highlighted in the spring of 2020 thisphenomenon and quoted New York intensive care doctor CameronKyle-Sidell who posted a soon deleted YouTube video to say thatthey had been told to prepare to treat an infectious disease called‘Covid-19’, but that was not what they were dealing with. Instead helikened the lung condition of the most severely ill patients to whatyou would expect with cabin depressurisation in a plane at 30,000feet or someone dropped on the top of Everest without oxygen oracclimatisation. I have never said this is not happening to a smallminority of alleged ‘Covid’ patients – I am saying this is not causedby a phantom ‘contagious virus’. Indeed Kyle-Sidell said that‘Covid-19’ was not the disease they were told was coming their way.‘We are operating under a medical paradigm that is untrue,’ he said,and he believed they were treating the wrong disease: ‘These peopleare being slowly starved of oxygen.’ Patients would take off theiroxygen masks in a state of fear and stress and while they were bluein the face on the brink of death. They did not look like patientsdying of pneumonia. You can see why they don’t want autopsieswhen their virus doesn’t exist and there is another condition in somepeople that they don’t wish to be uncovered.

I sat ina restaurant one night listening to a loud conversation on the nexttable where a family was discussing in bewilderment how a relativewho had no symptoms of ‘Covid’, and had died of a long-termproblem, could have been diagnosed a death by the ‘virus’. I couldunderstand their bewilderment. If they read this book they willknow why this medical fraud has been perpetrated the world over.Some media truth shockThe media ignored the evidence of death certificate fraud untileventually one columnist did speak out when she saw it first-hand.Bel Mooney is a long-time national newspaper journalist in Britaincurrently working for the Daily Mail. Her article on February 19th,2021, carried this headline: ‘My dad Ted passed three Covid tests"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"and died of a chronic illness yet he’s officially one of Britain’s 120,000victims of the virus and is far from alone ... so how many more arethere?’ She told how her 99-year-old father was in a care home witha long-standing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vasculardementia. Maybe, but he was still aware enough to tell her from thestart that there was no ‘virus’ and he refused the ‘vaccine’ for thatreason. His death was not unexpected given his chronic healthproblems and Mooney said she was shocked to find that ‘Covid-19’was declared the cause of death on his death certificate. She said thiswas a ‘bizarre and unacceptable untruth’ for a man with long-timehealth problems who had tested negative twice at the home for the‘virus’. I was also shocked by this story although not by what shesaid. I had been highlighting the death certificate manipulation forten months. It was the confirmation that a professional full-timejournalist only realised this was going on when it affected herdirectly and neither did she know that whether her dad testedpositive or negative was irrelevant with the test not testing for the‘virus’. Where had she been? She said she did not believe in‘conspiracy theories’ without knowing I’m sure that this and‘conspiracy theorists’ were terms put into widespread circulation bythe CIA in the 1960s to discredit those who did not accept theridiculous official story of the Kennedy assassination. A blanketstatement of ‘I don’t believe in conspiracy theories’ is always bizarre.The dictionary definition of the term alone means the world isdrowning in conspiracies. What she said was even more da\u0000 whenher dad had just been affected by the ‘Covid’ conspiracy. Why elsedoes she think that ‘Covid-19’ was going on the death certificates ofpeople who died of something else?To be fair once she saw from personal experience what washappening she didn’t mince words. Mooney was called by the carehome on the morning of February 9th to be told her father had diedin his sleep. When she asked for the official cause of death whatcame back was ‘Covid-19’. Mooney challenged this and was toldthere had been deaths from Covid on the dementia floor (confirmedby a test not testing for the ‘virus’) so they considered it ‘reasonable"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"to assume’. ‘But doctor,’ Mooney rightly protested, ‘an assumptionisn’t a diagnosis.’ She said she didn’t blame the perfectly decent andsympathetic doctor – ‘he was just doing his job’. Sorry, but that’sbullshit. He wasn’t doing his job at all. He was pu\u0000ing a false cause ofdeath on the death certificate and that is a criminal offence for whichhe should be brought to account and the same with the millions ofdoctors worldwide who have done the same. They were not doingtheir job they were following orders and that must not wash at newNuremberg trials any more than it did at the first ones. Mooney’sdoctor was ‘assuming’ (presuming) as he was told to, but ‘justfollowing orders’ makes no difference to his actions. A doctor’s job isto serve the patient and the truth, not follow orders, but that’s whatthey have done all over the world and played a central part inmaking the ‘Covid’ hoax possible with all its catastrophicconsequences for humanity. Shame on them and they must answerfor their actions. Mooney said her disquiet worsened when sheregistered her father’s death by telephone and was told by theregistrar there had been very many other cases like hers where ‘thedeceased’ had not tested positive for ‘Covid’ yet it was recorded asthe cause of death. The test may not ma\u0000er, but those involved attheir level think it ma\u0000ers and it shows a callous disregard foraccurate diagnosis. The pressure to do this is coming from the top ofthe national ‘health’ pyramids which in turn obey the World HealthOrganization which obeys Gates and the Cult. Mooney said theregistrar agreed that this must distort the national figures addingthat ‘the strangest thing is that every winter we record countlessdeaths from flu, and this winter there have been none. Not one!’ Sheasked if the registrar thought deaths from flu were beingmisdiagnosed and lumped together with ‘Covid’ deaths. The answerwas a ‘puzzled yes’. Mooney said that the funeral director said thesame about ‘Covid’ deaths which had nothing to do with ‘Covid’.They had lost count of the number of families upset by this andother funeral companies in different countries have had the sameexperience. Mooney wrote:"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The nightly shroud-waving and shocking close-ups of pain imposed on us by the TV newsbewildered and terrified the population into eager compliance with lockdowns. We wereinvited to ‘save the NHS’ and to grieve for strangers – the real-life loved ones behind thoseshocking death counts. Why would the public imagine what I now fear, namely that the wayCovid-19 death statistics are compiled might make the numbers seem greater than they are?Oh, just a li\u0000le bit – like 100 percent.Do the mathsMooney asked why a country would wish to skew its mortalityfigures by wrongly certifying deaths? What had been going on?Well, if you don’t believe in conspiracies you will never find theanswer which is that it’s a conspiracy. She did, however, describewhat she had discovered as a ‘national scandal’. In reality it’s aglobal scandal and happening everywhere. Pillars of this conspiracywere all put into place before the bu\u0000on was pressed with theDrosten PCR protocol and high amplifications to produce the casesand death certificate changes to secure illusory ‘Covid’ deaths.Mooney notes that normally two doctors were needed to certify adeath, with one having to know the patient, and how the rules werechanged in the spring of 2020 to allow one doctor to do this. In thesame period ‘Covid deaths’ were decreed to be all cases whereCovid-19 was put on the death certificate even without a positive testor any symptoms. Mooney asked: ‘How many of the 30,851 (as ofJanuary 15) care home resident deaths with Covid-19 on thecertificate (32.4 per cent of all deaths so far) were based on anassumption, like that of my father? And what has that done to ournational psyche?’All of them is the answer to the first question and ithas devastated and dismantled the national psyche, actually theglobal psyche, on a colossal scale. In the UK case and death data iscompiled by organisations like Public Health England (PHE) and theOffice for National Statistics (ONS). Mooney highlights the insanepolicy of counting a death from any cause as ‘Covid-19’ if thishappens within 28 days of a positive test (with a test not testing forthe ‘virus’) and she points out that ONS statistics reflect deaths‘involving Covid’ ‘or due to Covid’ which meant in practice any"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"death where ‘Covid-19’ was mentioned on the death certificate. Shedescribed the consequences of this fraud:Most people will accept the narrative they are fed, so panicky governments here and inEurope witnessed the harsh measures enacted in totalitarian China and jumped intolockdown. Headlines about Covid deaths tolled like the knell that would bring doomsday tous all. Fear stalked our empty streets. Politicians parroted the frankly ridiculous aim of ‘zeroCovid’ and shut down the economy, while most British people agreed that lockdown wasessential and (astonishingly to me, as a patriotic Brit) even wanted more restrictions.For what? Lies on death certificates? Never mind the grim toll of lives ruined, suicides, schoolsclosed, rising inequality, depression, cancelled hospital treatments, cancer patients in a tortureof waiting, poverty, economic devastation, loneliness, families kept apart, and so on. Howmany lives have been lost as a direct result of lockdown?She said that we could join in a national chorus of shock and horrorat reaching the 120,000 death toll which was surely certain to havebeen totally skewed all along, but what about the human cost oflockdown justified by these ‘death figures’? The British MedicalJournal had reported a 1,493 percent increase in cases of childrentaken to Great Ormond Street Hospital with abusive head injuriesalone and then there was the effect on families:Perhaps the most shocking thing about all this is that families have been kept apart – andobeyed the most irrational, changing rules at the whim of government – because theybelieved in the statistics. They succumbed to fear, which his generation rejected in that warfought for freedom. Dad (God rest his soul) would be angry. And so am I.Another theme to watch is that in the winter months when thereare more deaths from all causes they focus on ‘Covid’ deaths and inthe summer when the British Lung Foundation says respiratorydisease plummets by 80 percent they rage on about ‘cases’. Eitherway fascism on population is always the answer.Nazi eugenics in the 21st centuryElderly people in care homes have been isolated from their familiesmonth a\u0000er lonely month with no contact with relatives andgrandchildren who were banned from seeing them. We were told"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"that lockdown fascism was to ‘protect the vulnerable’ like elderlypeople. At the same time Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders wereplaced on their medical files so that if they needed resuscitation itwasn’t done and ‘Covid-19’ went on their death certificates. Oldpeople were not being ‘protected’ they were being culled –murdered in truth. DNR orders were being decreed for disabled andyoung people with learning difficulties or psychological problems.The UK Care Quality Commission, a non-departmental body of theDepartment of Health and Social Care, found that 34 percent ofthose working in health and social care were pressured into placing‘do not a\u0000empt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’ orders on ‘Covid’patients who suffered from disabilities and learning difficultieswithout involving the patient or their families in the decision. UKjudges ruled that an elderly woman with dementia should have theDNA-manipulating ‘Covid vaccine’ against her son’s wishes and thata man with severe learning difficulties should have the jab despitehis family’s objections. Never mind that many had already died. Thejudiciary always supports doctors and government in fascistdictatorships. They wouldn’t dare do otherwise. A horrific video wasposted showing fascist officers from Los Angeles police forciblygiving the ‘Covid’ shot to women with special needs who werescreaming that they didn’t want it. The same fascists are seen givingthe jab to a sleeping elderly woman in a care home. This is straightout of the Nazi playbook. Hitler’s Nazis commi\u0000ed mass murder ofthe mentally ill and physically disabled throughout Germany andoccupied territories in the programme that became known as AktionT4, or just T4. Sabbatian-controlled Hitler and his grotesque craziesset out to kill those they considered useless and unnecessary. TheReich Commi\u0000ee for the Scientific Registering of Hereditary andCongenital Illnesses registered the births of babies identified byphysicians to have ‘defects’. By 1941 alone more than 5,000 childrenwere murdered by the state and it is estimated that in total thenumber of innocent people killed in Aktion T4 was between 275,000and 300,000. Parents were told their children had been sent away for‘special treatment’ never to return. It is rather pathetic to see claimsabout plans for new extermination camps being dismissed today"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"when the same force behind current events did precisely that 80years ago. Margaret Sanger was a Cult operative who used ‘birthcontrol’ to sanitise her programme of eugenics. Organisations shefounded became what is now Planned Parenthood. Sanger proposedthat ‘the whole dysgenic population would have its choice ofsegregation or sterilization’. These included epileptics, ‘feeble-minded’, and prostitutes. Sanger opposed charity because itperpetuated ‘human waste‘. She reveals the Cult mentality and ifanyone thinks that extermination camps are a ‘conspiracy theory’their naivety is touching if breathtakingly stupid.If you don’t believe that doctors can act with callous disregard fortheir patients it is worth considering that doctors and medical staffagreed to put government-decreed DNR orders on medical files anddo nothing when resuscitation is called for. I don’t know what youcall such people in your house. In mine they are Nazis from the JosefMengele School of Medicine. Phenomenal numbers of old peoplehave died worldwide from the effects of lockdown, depression, lackof treatment, the ‘vaccine’ (more later) and losing the will to live. Acommon response at the start of the manufactured pandemic was toremove old people from hospital beds and transfer them to nursinghomes. The decision would result in a mass cull of elderly people inthose homes through lack of treatment – not ‘Covid’. Care homewhistleblowers have told how once the ‘Covid’ era began doctorswould not come to their homes to treat patients and they werebegging for drugs like antibiotics that o\u0000en never came.

In March, 2021, Spain legalised euthanasia andassisted suicide following the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourgand Canada on the Tiptoe to the demise pill. Treatment of old peopleby many ‘care’ homes has been a disgrace in the ‘Covid’ era. Thereare many, many, caring staff – I know some. There have, however,been legions of stories about callous treatment of old people andtheir families. Police were called when families came to take theirloved ones home in the light of isolation that was killing them. Theybecame prisoners of the state. Care home residents in insane, fascistOntario, Canada, were not allowed to leave their room once the‘Covid’ hoax began. UK staff have even wheeled elderly peopleaway from windows where family members were talking with them.Oriana Criscuolo from Stockport in the English North West droppedoff some things for her 80-year-old father who has Parkinson’sdisease and dementia and she wanted to wave to him through aground-floor window. She was told that was ‘illegal’. When she wentanyway they closed the curtains in the middle of the day. Orianasaid:It’s just unbelievable.

UK registered nurse Nicky Millen, aproper old school nurse for 40 years, said that when she started hercareer care was based on dignity, choice, compassion and empathy.Now she said ‘the things that are important to me have gone out ofthe window.’ She was appalled that people were dying without theirloved ones and saying goodbye on iPads. Nicky described how adistressed 89-year-old lady stroked her face and asked her ‘howmany paracetamol would it take to finish me off’. Life was no longerworth living while not seeing her family. Nicky said she washumiliated in front of the ward staff and patients for le\u0000ing the ladystroke her face and giving her a cuddle. Such is the dehumanisationthat the ‘Covid’ hoax has brought to the surface. Nicky worked incare homes where patients told her they were being held prisoner. ‘Iwant to live until I die’, one said to her. ‘I had a lady in tears becauseshe hadn’t seen her great-grandson.’ Nicky was compassionate oldschool meeting psychopathic New Normal. She also said she hadworked on a ‘Covid’ ward with no ‘Covid’ patients. Jewish writerShai Held wrote an article in March, 2020, which was headlined ‘TheStaggering, Heartless Cruelty Toward the Elderly’. What hedescribed was happening from the earliest days of lockdown. Hesaid ‘the elderly’ were considered a group and not uniqueindividuals (the way of the Woke). Shai Held said:Notice how the all-too-familiar rhetoric of dehumanization works: ‘The elderly’ are bunchedtogether as a faceless mass, all of them considered culprits and thus effectively deserving ofthe suffering the pandemic will inflict upon them. Lost entirely is the fact that the elderly areindividual human beings, each with a distinctive face and voice, each with hopes anddreams, memories and regrets, friendships and marriages, loves lost and loves sustained.‘The elderly’ have become another dehumanised group for whichanything goes and for many that has resulted in cold disregard fortheir rights and their life.

It was all propaganda to ramp upthe fear to ensure compliance with fascism as were never-usedtemporary hospitals with thousands of beds known as Nightingalesand never-used make-shi\u0000 mortuaries opened by the criminal UKgovernment. A man who helped to install those extra island bedsa\u0000ributed to the army said they were never used and the hospitalwas empty.

This compares with the 3.4 percent claimed by theCult-owned World Health Organization when the hoax was firstplayed and maximum fear needed to be generated. An updatedStanford study in April, 2021, put the ‘infection’ to ‘fatality’ rate atjust 0.15 percent. Another team of scientists led by Megan O’Driscolland Henrik Salje studied data from 45 countries and published theirfindings on the Nature website.

Decisions are not being made to protect health,but to target psychology. The dominant group guiding and‘advising’ government policy are not medical professionals. They arepsychologists and behavioural scientists. Every major country has itsown version of this phenomenon and I’ll use the British example toshow how it works. In many ways the British version has beenaffecting the wider world in the form of the huge behaviourmanipulation network in the UK which operates in other countries.The network involves private companies, government, intelligenceand military. The Cabinet Office is at the centre of the government‘Covid’ Psyop and part-owns, with ‘innovation charity’ Nesta, theBehavioural Insights Team (BIT) which claims to be independent ofgovernment but patently isn’t. The BIT was established in 2010 andits job is to manipulate the psyche of the population to acquiesce togovernment demands and so much more. It is also known as the‘Nudge Unit’, a name inspired by the 2009 book by two ultra-Zionists, Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, called Nudge: ImprovingDecisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. The book, as with theBehavioural Insights Team, seeks to ‘nudge’ behaviour (manipulateit) to make the public follow pa\u0000erns of action and perception thatsuit those in authority (the Cult). Sunstein is so skilled at this that headvises the World Health Organization and the UK BehaviouralInsights Team and was Administrator of the White House Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration.Biden appointed him to the Department of Homeland Security –another ultra-Zionist in the fold to oversee new immigration lawswhich is another policy the Cult wants to control. Sunstein isdesperate to silence anyone exposing conspiracies and co-authored a2008 report on the subject in which suggestions were offered to ban‘conspiracy theorizing’ or impose ‘some kind of tax, financial orotherwise, on those who disseminate such theories’.

Shiller and they, withThaler, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for theirwork in this field. The Behavioural Insights Team is operating at theheart of the UK government and has expanded globally throughpartnerships with several universities including Harvard, Oxford,Cambridge, University College London (UCL) and Pennsylvania.They claim to have ‘trained’ (reframed) 20,000 civil servants and runmore than 750 projects involving 400 randomised controlled trials indozens of countries’ as another version of mind reframers CommonPurpose.

When politicians say they are being guided by ‘the science’this is the rabble in each country they are talking about and that‘science’ is dominated by behaviour manipulators to enforcegovernment fascism through public compliance. The BehaviourInsight Team is headed by psychologist David Solomon Halpern, avisiting professor at King’s College London, and connects with anational and global web of other civilian and military organisationsas the Cult moves towards its goal of fusing them into one fascisticwhole in every country through its ‘Fusion Doctrine’. The behaviourmanipulation network involves, but is not confined to, the ForeignOffice; National Security Council; government communicationsheadquarters (GCHQ); MI5; MI6; the Cabinet Office-based MediaMonitoring Unit; and the Rapid Response Unit which ‘monitorsdigital trends to spot emerging issues; including misinformation anddisinformation; and identifies the best way to respond’.There is also the 77th Brigade of the UK military which operateslike the notorious Israeli military’s Unit 8200 in manipulatinginformation and discussion on the Internet by posing as members ofthe public to promote the narrative and discredit those whochallenge it.

The network of psychologists was on the‘Covid’ case from the start with the aim of generating maximum fearof the ‘virus’ to ensure compliance by the population. A governmentbehavioural science group known as SPI-B produced a paper inMarch, 2020, for discussion by the main government scienceadvisory group known as SAGE. It was headed ‘Options forincreasing adherence to social distancing measures’ and it said thefollowing in a section headed ‘Persuasion’:A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficientlypersonally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by thelow death rate in their demographic group, although levels ofconcern may be rising.

That’s not happened has it? Those excuses for ‘journalists’who wouldn’t know journalism if it bit them on the arse (the greatmajority) have played their crucial part in serving this Cult-government Psyop to enslave their own kids and grandkids. Howthey live with themselves I have no idea. The psychological war hasbeen underpinned by constant government ‘Covid’ propaganda inalmost every television and radio ad break, plus the Internet andprint media, which has pounded out the fear with taxpayers footingthe bill for their own programming. The result has been peopleterrified of a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist or one with a tiny fatality rateeven if you believe it does. People walk down the street and aroundthe shops wearing face-nappies damaging their health andpsychology while others report those who refuse to be that naïve tothe police who turn up in their own face-nappies.

The fear which has gripped the minds of somany and frozen them into compliance has been carefully cultivatedby these psychologists who are really psychopaths.

SPI-B then turned to compulsion on the public tocomply. ‘With adequate preparation, rapid change can be achieved’,it said.

Translated from the Orwellian thismeans making the rest of population feel guilty for not protectingthe ‘vulnerable’ such as old people which the Cult and its agencieswere about to kill on an industrial scale with lockdown, lack oftreatment and the Gates ‘vaccine’. Psychopath psychologists soldtheir guilt-trip so comprehensively that Los Angeles CountySupervisor Hilda Solis reported that children were apologising (froma distance) to their parents and grandparents for bringing ‘Covid’into their homes and ge\u0000ing them sick. ‘... These apologies are justsome of the last words that loved ones will ever hear as they diealone,’ she said. Gut-wrenchingly Solis then used this childhoodtragedy to tell children to stay at home and ‘keep your loved onesalive’. Imagine heaping such potentially life-long guilt on a kid whenit has absolutely nothing to do with them. These people are deeplydisturbed and the psychologists behind this even more so.Uncivil war – divide and ruleProfessional mind-controllers at SPI-B wanted the media to increasea sense of responsibility to others (do as you’re told) and promote‘positive messaging’ for those actions while in contrast to invoke‘social disapproval’ by the unquestioning, obedient, community ofanyone with a mind of their own. Again the compliant Goebbels-likemedia obliged. This is an old, old, trick employed by tyrannies theworld over throughout human history.

Harlow put other monkeys in steel chambers forthree, six or twelve months while denying them any contact withanimals or humans. He said that the effects of total social isolationfor six months were ‘so devastating and debilitating that we hadassumed initially that twelve months of isolation would not produceany additional decrement’; but twelve months of isolation ‘almostobliterated the animals socially’.

You are going to see efforts toturn the young against the old to support this geriatric genocide.Hannah Flanagan said the big increase in suicide in her countyproved that social isolation is not only harmful, but deadly. Studieshave shown that isolation from others is one of the main risk factorsin suicide and even more so with women. Warnings that lockdowncould create a ‘perfect storm’ for suicide were ignored. A\u0000er all thiswas one of the reasons for lockdown. Suicide, however, is only themost extreme of isolation consequences. There are many others. DrDhruv Khullar, assistant professor of healthcare policy at WeillCornell Medical College, said in a New York Times article in 2016 longbefore the fake ‘pandemic’:A wave of new research suggests social separation is bad for us. Individuals with less socialconnection have disrupted sleep patterns, altered immune systems, more inflammation andhigher levels of stress hormones. One recent study found that isolation increases the risk ofheart disease by 29 percent and stroke by 32 percent. Another analysis that pooled data from70 studies and 3.4 million people found that socially isolated individuals had a 30 percenthigher risk of dying in the next seven years, and that this effect was largest in middle age."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Loneliness can accelerate cognitive decline in older adults, and isolated individuals are twiceas likely to die prematurely as those with more robust social interactions. These effects startearly: Socially isolated children have significantly poorer health 20 years later, even aftercontrolling for other factors. All told, loneliness is as important a risk factor for early death asobesity and smoking.There you have proof from that one article alone four years before2020 that those who have enforced lockdown, social distancing andisolation knew what the effect would be and that is even more sowith professional psychologists that have been driving the policyacross the globe. We can go back even further to the years 2000 and2003 and the start of a major study on the effects of isolation onhealth by Dr Janine Gronewold and Professor Dirk M. Hermann atthe University Hospital in Essen, Germany, who analysed data on4,316 people with an average age of 59 who were recruited for thelong-term research project. They found that socially isolated peopleare more than 40 percent more likely to have a heart a\u0000ack, stroke,or other major cardiovascular event and nearly 50 percent morelikely to die from any cause. Given the financial Armageddonunleashed by lockdown we should note that the study found arelationship between increased cardiovascular risk and lack offinancial support. A\u0000er excluding other factors social isolation wasstill connected to a 44 percent increased risk of cardiovascularproblems and a 47 percent increased risk of death by any cause. Lackof financial support was associated with a 30 percent increase in therisk of cardiovascular health events. Dr Gronewold said it had beenknown for some time that feeling lonely or lacking contact with closefriends and family can have an impact on physical health and thestudy had shown that having strong social relationships is of highimportance for heart health. Gronewold said they didn’t understandyet why people who are socially isolated have such poor healthoutcomes, but this was obviously a worrying finding, particularlyduring these times of prolonged social distancing. Well, it can beexplained on many levels. You only have to identify the point in thebody where people feel loneliness and missing people they areparted from – it’s in the centre of the chest where they feel the acheof loneliness and the ache of missing people. ‘My heart aches for"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"you’ ... ‘My heart aches for some company.’ I will explain this morein the chapter Escaping Wetiko, but when you realise that the bodyis the mind – they are expressions of each other – the reason whystate of the mind dictates state of the body becomes clear.American psychologist Ranjit Powar was highlighting the effectsof lockdown isolation as early as April, 2020. She said humans haveevolved to be social creatures and are wired to live in interactivegroups. Being isolated from family, friends and colleagues could beunbalancing and traumatic for most people and could result in shortor even long-term psychological and physical health problems. Anincrease in levels of anxiety, aggression, depression, forgetfulnessand hallucinations were possible psychological effects of isolation.‘Mental conditions may be precipitated for those with underlyingpre-existing susceptibilities and show up in many others withoutany pre-condition.’ Powar said personal relationships helped us copewith stress and if we lost this outlet for le\u0000ing off steam the resultcan be a big emotional void which, for an average person, wasdifficult to deal with. ‘Just a few days of isolation can causeincreased levels of anxiety and depression’ – so what the hell hasbeen the effect on the global population of 18 months of this at thetime of writing? Powar said: ‘Add to it the looming threat of adreadful disease being repeatedly hammered in through the mediaand you have a recipe for many shades of mental and physicaldistress.’ For those with a house and a garden it is easy to forget thatbillions have had to endure lockdown isolation in tiny overcrowdedflats and apartments with nowhere to go outside. The psychologicaland physical consequences of this are unimaginable and with lunaticand abusive partners and parents the consequences have led totremendous increases in domestic and child abuse and alcoholism aspeople seek to shut out the horror. Ranjit Powar said:Staying in a confined space with family is not all a rosy picture for everyone. It can beextremely oppressive and claustrophobic for large low-income families huddled together insmall single-room houses. Children here are not lucky enough to have many board/electronicgames or books to keep them occupied."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Add to it the deep insecurity of running out of funds for food and basic necessities. On theother hand, there are people with dysfunctional family dynamics, such as domineering,abusive or alcoholic partners, siblings or parents which makes staying home a period of trial.Incidence of suicide and physical abuse against women has shown a worldwide increase.Heightened anxiety and depression also affect a person’s immune system, making them moresusceptible to illness.To think that Powar’s article was published on April 11th, 2020.Six-feet fantasySocial (unsocial) distancing demanded that people stay six feet ortwo metres apart. UK government advisor Robert Dingwall from theNew and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group saidin a radio interview that the two-metre rule was ‘conjured up out ofnowhere’ and was not based on science. No, it was not based onmedical science, but it didn’t come out of nowhere. The distancerelated to psychological science. Six feet/two metres was adopted inmany countries and we were told by people like the criminalAnthony Fauci and his ilk that it was founded on science. Manyschools could not reopen because they did not have the space for six-feet distancing. Then in March, 2021, a\u0000er a year of six-feet ‘science’,a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases involving morethan 500,000 students and almost 100,000 staff over 16 weeksrevealed no significant difference in ‘Covid’ cases between six feetand three feet and Fauci changed his tune. Now three feet was okay.There is no difference between six feet and three inches when there isno ‘virus’ and they got away with six feet for psychological reasonsfor as long as they could. I hear journalists and others talk about‘unintended consequences’ of lockdown. They are not unintended atall; they have been coldly-calculated for a specific outcome of humancontrol and that’s why super-psychopaths like Gates have called forthem so vehemently. Super-psychopath psychologists havedemanded them and psychopathic or clueless, spineless, politicianshave gone along with them by ‘following the science’.

Why does a behaviouralpsychologist from a group charged with changing the behaviour ofthe public want lockdown, human isolation and mandatory masks?Does that question really need an answer? Michie absolutely has toexplain herself before a Nuremberg court when humanity takes backits world again and even more so when you see the consequences ofmasks that she demands are compulsory.

We are seeing more governments and companiesfunding and producing wearable gadgets to keep people apart andthey would not be doing that if this was meant to be short-term.

TheCIA has also supported tech companies developing similar devices.The wearable sensor was developed by Tended, one of a number ofstart-up companies supported by GCHQ (see the CIA and DARPA).The device can be worn on the wrist or as a tag on the waistband andwill vibrate whenever someone wearing the device breaches socialdistancing and gets anywhere near natural human contact. Thecompany had a lucky break in that it was developing a distancingsensor when the ‘Covid’ hoax arrived which immediately provided apotentially enormous market. How fortunate.

Many of them werebehind the creation of NASA and they included Nazi scientist andSS officer Wernher von Braun who swapped designing V-2 rockets tobombard London with designing the Saturn V rockets that poweredthe NASA moon programme’s Apollo cra\u0000.

I had been observing ‘Covidregulations’ and the relationship between authority and public formonths. I saw techniques that I knew were employed on individualsin MKUltra being used on the global population. I had read manybooks and manuals on mind control including one called SilentWeapons for Quiet Wars which came to light in the 1980s and was aguide on how to perceptually program on a mass scale. ‘SilentWeapons’ refers to mind-control. I remembered a line from themanual as governments, medical authorities and law enforcementagencies have so obviously talked to – or rather at – the adultpopulation since the ‘Covid’ hoax began as if they are children. Thedocument said:If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year-old, then, due tosuggestibility, he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion with theuncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach in to his economic reservoir anddeliver its energy to buy that product on impulse when he passes it in the store.That’s why authority has spoken to adults like children since all thisbegan.Why did Michael Jackson wear masks?Every aspect of the ‘Covid’ narrative has mind-control as its centraltheme.

Hewas subjected to MKUltra mind control through Project Monarchand his psyche was scrambled by these simpletons. Cathy wrote:In MKUltra Project Monarch mind control, Michael Jackson had to wear a mask to silence hisvoice so he could not reach out for help. Remember how he developed that whisper voicewhen he wasn’t singing? Masks control the mind from the outside in, like the redefining ofwords is doing. By controlling what we can and cannot say for fear of being labeled racist orbeaten, for example, it ultimately controls thought that drives our words and ultimately actions(or lack thereof).Likewise, a mask muffles our speech so that we are not heard, which controls voice ... words... mind.

Griesz-Brisson has a PhD inpharmacology, with special interest in neurotoxicology,environmental medicine, neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity (theway the brain can change in the light of information received). Shewent public in October, 2020, with a passionate warning about theeffects of mask-wearing laws:The reinhalation of our exhaled air will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and aflooding of carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygendeprivation. There are nerve cells for example in the hippocampus that can’t be longer than 3minutes without oxygen – they cannot survive. The acute warning symptoms are headaches,drowsiness, dizziness, issues in concentration, slowing down of reaction time – reactions ofthe cognitive system.Oh, I know, let’s tell bus, truck and taxi drivers to wear them andpeople working machinery. How about pilots, doctors and police?Griesz-Brisson makes the important point that while the symptomsshe mentions may fade as the body readjusts this does not alter thefact that people continue to operate in oxygen deficit with long list of"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"potential consequences. She said it was well known thatneurodegenerative diseases take years or decades to develop. ‘Iftoday you forget your phone number, the breakdown in your brainwould have already started 20 or 30 years ago.’ She saiddegenerative processes in your brain are ge\u0000ing amplified as youroxygen deprivation continues through wearing a mask. Nerve cellsin the brain are unable to divide themselves normally in thesecircumstances and lost nerve cells will no longer be regenerated.‘What is gone is gone.’ Now consider that people like shop workersand schoolchildren are wearing masks for hours every day. What inthe name of sanity is going to be happening to them? ‘I do not weara mask, I need my brain to think’, Griesz-Brisson said, ‘I want tohave a clear head when I deal with my patients and not be in acarbon dioxide-induced anaesthesia’. If you are told to wear a maskanywhere ask the organisation, police, store, whatever, for their riskassessment on the dangers and negative effects on mind and body ofenforcing mask-wearing. They won’t have one because it has neverbeen done not even by government. All of them must be subject toclass-action lawsuits as the consequences come to light. They don’tdo mask risk assessments for an obvious reason. They know whatthe conclusions would be and independent scientific studies thathave been done tell a horror story of consequences.‘Masks are criminal’Dr Griesz-Brisson said that for children and adolescents, masks arean absolute no-no. They had an extremely active and adaptiveimmune system and their brain was incredibly active with so muchto learn. ‘The child’s brain, or the youth’s brain, is thirsting foroxygen.’ The more metabolically active an organ was, the moreoxygen it required; and in children and adolescents every organ wasmetabolically active. Griesz-Brisson said that to deprive a child’s oradolescent’s brain of oxygen, or to restrict it in any way, was not onlydangerous to their health, it was absolutely criminal. ‘Oxygendeficiency inhibits the development of the brain, and the damagethat has taken place as a result CANNOT be reversed.’ Mind"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"manipulators of MKUltra put masks on two-year-olds they wantedto neurologically rewire and you can see why.

The move would have devastatedwhat’s le\u0000 of the Spanish tourist industry, posed potential breathingdangers to swimmers and had Northern European sunbatherswalking around with their forehead brown and the rest of their facewhite as a sheet. The ruling was so crazy that it had to be retracteda\u0000er pressure from public and tourist industry, but it confirmedwhere the Cult wants to go with masks and how clinically insaneauthority has become. The determination to make masks permanentand hide the serious dangers to body and mind can be seen in thecensorship of scientist Professor Denis Rancourt by Bill Gates-funded academic publishing website ResearchGate over his papersexposing the dangers and uselessness of masks. Rancourt said:ResearchGate today has permanently locked my account, which I have had since 2015. Theirreasons graphically show the nature of their attack against democracy, and their corruption of"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"science ... By their obscene non-logic, a scientific review of science articles reporting onharms caused by face masks has a ‘potential to cause harm’. No criticism of the psychologicaldevice (face masks) is tolerated, if the said criticism shows potential to influence public policy.This is what happens in a fascist world.Where are the ‘greens’ (again)?Other dangers of wearing masks especially regularly relate to theinhalation of minute plastic fibres into the lungs and the deluge ofdiscarded masks in the environment and oceans. Estimatespredicted that more than 1.5 billion disposable masks will end up inthe world’s oceans every year polluting the water with tons of plasticand endangering marine wildlife. Studies project that humans areusing 129 billion face masks each month worldwide – about threemillion a minute. Most are disposable and made from plastic, non-biodegradable microfibers that break down into smaller plasticparticles that become widespread in ecosystems. They are li\u0000eringcities, clogging sewage channels and turning up in bodies of water. Ihave wri\u0000en in other books about the immense amounts ofmicroplastics from endless sources now being absorbed into thebody. Rolf Halden, director of the Arizona State University (ASU)Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering, was thesenior researcher in a 2020 study that analysed 47 human tissuesamples and found microplastics in all of them. ‘We have detectedthese chemicals of plastics in every single organ that we haveinvestigated’, he said. I wrote in The Answer about the world beingdeluged with microplastics. A study by the Worldwide Fund forNature (WWF) found that people are consuming on average everyweek some 2,000 tiny pieces of plastic mostly through water and alsothrough marine life and the air. Every year humans are ingestingenough microplastics to fill a heaped dinner plate and in a life-timeof 79 years it is enough to fill two large waste bins. MarcoLambertini, WWF International director general said: ‘Not only areplastics polluting our oceans and waterways and killing marine life –it’s in all of us and we can’t escape consuming plastics,’ American"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"geologists found tiny plastic fibres, beads and shards in rainwatersamples collected from the remote slopes of the Rocky MountainNational Park near Denver, Colorado. Their report was headed: ‘It israining plastic.’ Rachel Adams, senior lecturer in Biomedical Scienceat Cardiff Metropolitan University, said that among healthconsequences are internal inflammation and immune responses to a‘foreign body’. She further pointed out that microplastics becomecarriers of toxins including mercury, pesticides and dioxins (aknown cause of cancer and reproductive and developmentalproblems). These toxins accumulate in the fa\u0000y tissues once theyenter the body through microplastics. Now this is beingcompounded massively by people pu\u0000ing plastic on their face andthrowing it away.Workers exposed to polypropylene plastic fibres known as ‘flock’have developed ‘flock worker’s lung’ from inhaling small pieces ofthe flock fibres which can damage lung tissue, reduce breathingcapacity and exacerbate other respiratory problems. Now ...commonly used surgical masks have three layers of melt-blowntextiles made of ... polypropylene. We have billions of peoplepu\u0000ing these microplastics against their mouth, nose and face forhours at a time day a\u0000er day in the form of masks. How doesanyone think that will work out? I mean – what could possibly gowrong? We posted a number of scientific studies on this atdavidicke.com, but when I went back to them as I was writing thisbook the links to the science research website where they werehosted were dead. Anything that challenges the official narrative inany way is either censored or vilified. The official narrative is sounsupportable by the evidence that only deleting the truth canprotect it. A study by Chinese scientists still survived – with theusual twist which it why it was still active, I guess. Yes, they foundthat virtually all the masks they tested increased the daily intake ofmicroplastic fibres, but people should still wear them because thedanger from the ‘virus’ was worse said the crazy ‘team’ from theInstitute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan. Scientists first discoveredmicroplastics in lung tissue of some patients who died of lung cancer"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"in the 1990s. Subsequent studies have confirmed the potential healthdamage with the plastic degrading slowly and remaining in thelungs to accumulate in volume. Wuhan researchers used a machinesimulating human breathing to establish that masks shed up tonearly 4,000 microplastic fibres in a month with reused masksproducing more. Scientists said some masks are laced with toxicchemicals and a variety of compounds seriously restricted for bothhealth and environmental reasons. They include cobalt (used in bluedye) and formaldehyde known to cause watery eyes, burningsensations in the eyes, nose, and throat, plus coughing, wheezingand nausea. No – that must be ‘Covid-19’.Mask ‘worms’There is another and potentially even more sinister content of masks.Mostly new masks of different makes filmed under a microscopearound the world have been found to contain strange black fibres or‘worms’ that appear to move or ‘crawl’ by themselves and react toheat and water. The nearest I have seen to them are the self-replicating fibres that are pulled out through the skin of thosesuffering from Morgellons disease which has been connected to thephenomena of ‘chemtrails’ which I will bring into the story later on.Morgellons fibres continue to grow outside the body and have aform of artificial intelligence. Black ‘worm’ fibres in masks have thatkind of feel to them and there is a nanotechnology technique called‘worm micelles’ which carry and release drugs or anything else youwant to deliver to the body. For sure the suppression of humanity bymind altering drugs is the Cult agenda big time and the moreexcuses they can find to gain access to the body the moreopportunities there are to make that happen whether through‘vaccines’ or masks pushed against the mouth and nose for hours onend.So let us summarise the pros and cons of masks:"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Against masks: Breathing in your own carbon dioxide; depriving thebody and brain of sufficient oxygen; build-up of toxins in the maskthat can be breathed into the lungs and cause rashes on the face and‘mask-mouth’; breathing microplastic fibres and toxic chemicals intothe lungs; dehumanisation and deleting individualisation by literallymaking people faceless; destroying human emotional interactionthrough facial expression and deleting parental connection withtheir babies which look for guidance to their facial expression.For masks: They don’t protect you from a ‘virus’ that doesn’t existand even if it did ‘viral’ particles are so minute they are smaller thanthe holes in the mask.Governments, police, supermarkets, businesses, transportcompanies, and all the rest who seek to impose masks have done norisk assessment on their consequences for health and psychologyand are now open to group lawsuits when the impact becomes clearwith a cumulative epidemic of respiratory and other disease.Authorities will try to exploit these effects and hide the real cause bydubbing them ‘Covid-19’. Can you imagine se\u0000ing out to force thepopulation to wear health-destroying masks without doing anyassessment of the risks? It is criminal and it is evil, but then howmany people targeted in this way, who see their children told towear them all day at school, have asked for a risk assessment?Billions can’t be imposed upon by the few unless the billions allow it.Oh, yes, with just a tinge of irony, 85 percent of all masks madeworldwide come from China.Wash your hands in toxic shite‘Covid’ rules include the use of toxic sanitisers and again the healthconsequences of constantly applying toxins to be absorbed throughthe skin is obvious to any level of Renegade Mind.

This is particularly important for youngchildren, especially toddlers, who may be attracted by the pleasant smell or brightly coloredbottles of hand sanitizer.Drinking even a small amount of hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children.(However, there is no need to be concerned if your children eat with or lick their hands afterusing hand sanitizer.) During this coronavirus pandemic, poison control centers have had anincrease in calls about accidental ingestion of hand sanitizer, so it is important that adultsmonitor young children’s use.Do not allow pets to swallow hand sanitizer. If you think your pet has eaten somethingpotentially dangerous, call your veterinarian or a pet poison control center right away. Handsanitizer is flammable and should be stored away from heat and flames. When using handsanitizer, rub your hands until they feel completely dry before performing activities that mayinvolve heat, sparks, static electricity, or open flames.There you go, perfectly safe, then, and that’s without even a mentionof the toxins absorbed through the skin. Come on kids – sanitiseyour hands everywhere you go. It will save you from the ‘virus’. Putall these elements together of the ‘Covid’ normal and see how muchhealth and psychology is being cumulatively damaged, evendevastated, to ‘protect your health’. Makes sense, right? They areonly imposing these things because they care, right? Right?Submitting to insanityPsychological reframing of the population goes very deep and isdone in many less obvious ways. I hear people say howcontradictory and crazy ‘Covid’ rules are and how they are everchanging. This is explained away by dismissing those involved asidiots. It is a big mistake. The Cult is delighted if its cold calculationis perceived as incompetence and idiocy when it is anything but.

Many mayeventually follow, but the few with the iron spines (self-respect) kickit off and generate the momentum. The Cult targets self-respect inthe knowledge that once this has gone only submission remains.Crazy, contradictory, ever-changing ‘Covid’ rules are systematicallyapplied by psychologists to delete self-respect. They want you to seethat the rules make no sense. It is one thing to decide to dosomething when you have made the choice based on evidence andlogic. You still retain your self-respect. It is quite another when youcan see what you are being told to do is insane, ridiculous andmakes no sense, and yet you still do it. Your self-respect isextinguished and this has been happening as ever more obviouslystupid and nonsensical things have been demanded and the greatmajority have complied even when they can see they are stupid andnonsensical.People walk around in face-nappies knowing they are damagingtheir health and make no difference to a ‘virus’. They do it in fear ofnot doing it. I know it’s da\u0000, but I’ll do it anyway. When thathappens something dies inside of you and submissive reframing hasbegun. Next there’s a need to hide from yourself that you haveconceded your self-respect and you convince yourself that you havenot really submi\u0000ed to fear and intimidation. You begin to believethat you are complying with craziness because it’s the right thing todo. When first you concede your self-respect of 2+2 = 4 to 2+2 = 5 youknow you are compromising your self-respect. Gradually to avoidfacing that fact you begin to believe that 2+2=5.

Anal swabsare mandatory for incoming passengers in parts of China andAmerican diplomats have said they were forced to undergo theindignity which would have been calculated humiliation by theCult-owned Chinese government that has America in its sights.Government-people: An abusive relationshipSpirit-breaking psychological techniques include giving people hopeand apparent respite from tyranny only to take it away again. Thishappened in the UK during Christmas, 2020, when the psycho-psychologists and their political lackeys announced an easing ofrestrictions over the holiday only to reimpose them almostimmediately on the basis of yet another lie. There is a bigpsychological difference between ge\u0000ing used to oppression andbeing given hope of relief only to have that dashed. Psychologistsknow this and we have seen the technique used repeatedly. Thenthere is traumatising people before you introduce more extremeregulations that require compliance. A perfect case was theannouncement by the dark and sinister Whi\u0000y and Vallance in theUK that ‘new data’ predicted that 4,000 could die every day over thewinter of 2020/2021 if we did not lockdown again.

Keepingpartner confused or off balance by saying they were just kidding orblaming the partner for ‘making’ them act this way ...

They might throw objects at them or harm them with aweapon. [Observe the physical harm imposed by masks, lockdown,and so on.]Threats and intimidation: One way abusers keep their partners inline is by instilling fear. They might be verbally threatening, or givethreatening looks or gestures. Abusers o\u0000en make it known thatthey are tracking their partner’s every move. They might destroytheir partner’s possessions, threaten to harm them, or threaten toharm their family members. Not surprisingly, victims of this abuseo\u0000en feel anxiety, fear, and panic.

This can be done subconsciously to such an extentthat subjects have no idea they have been ‘reframed’ while to anyobserver changes in behaviour and a\u0000itudes are obvious.Human society is being reframed on a ginormous scale since thestart of 2020 and here we have the reason why psychologists ratherthan doctors have been calling the shots. Ask most people who havesuccumbed to ‘Covid’ reframing if they have changed and most willsay ‘no’; but they have and fundamentally. The Cult’s long-game hasbeen preparing for these times since way back and crucial to that hasbeen to prepare both population and officialdom mentally andemotionally. To use the mind-control parlance they had to reframethe population with a mentality that would submit to fascism andreframe those in government and law enforcement to imposefascism or at least go along with it. The result has been the fact-deleted mindlessness of ‘Wokeness’ and officialdom that has eitherenthusiastically or unquestioningly imposed global tyrannydemanded by reframed politicians on behalf of psychopathic anddeeply evil cultists. ‘Cognitive reframing’ identifies and challengesthe way someone sees the world in the form of situations,experiences and emotions and then restructures those perceptions toview the same set of circumstances in a different way.

Beck’s daughter Judith S.Beck is prominent in the same field and they founded the BeckInstitute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia in 1994.Cognitive reframing, however, began to be used worldwide by thosewith a very dark agenda. The Cult reframes politicians to changetheir a\u0000itudes and actions until they are completely at odds withwhat they once appeared to stand for. The same has been happeningto government administrators at all levels, law enforcement, militaryand the human population. Cultists love mind control for two mainreasons: It allows them to control what people think, do and say tosecure agenda advancement and, by definition, it calms theirlegendary insecurity and fear of the unexpected. I have studied mindcontrol since the time I travelled America in 1996. I may have beentalking to next to no one in terms of an audience in those years, butmy goodness did I gather a phenomenal amount of information andknowledge about so many things including the techniques of mindcontrol. I have described this in detail in other books going back toThe Biggest Secret in 1998. I met a very large number of peoplerecovering from MKUltra and its offshoots and successors and Ibegan to see how these same techniques were being used on thepopulation in general. This was never more obvious than since the‘Covid’ hoax began.Reframing the enforcersI have observed over the last two decades and more the very cleartransformation in the dynamic between the police, officialdom andthe public. I tracked this in the books as the relationship mutatedfrom one of serving the public to seeing them as almost the enemyand certainly a lower caste.

The transformation was so clear andwidespread that it had to be planned. Collective a\u0000itudes anddynamics do not change naturally and organically that quickly onthat scale. I then came across an organisation in Britain calledCommon Purpose created in the late 1980s by Julia Middleton whowould work in the office of Deputy Prime Minister John Presco\u0000during the long and disastrous premiership of war criminal TonyBlair. When Blair speaks the Cult is speaking and the man shouldhave been in jail a long time ago. Common Purpose proclaims itselfto be one of the biggest ‘leadership development’ organisations inthe world while functioning as a charity with all the financial benefitswhich come from that. It hosts ‘leadership development’ courses andprogrammes all over the world and claims to have ‘broughttogether’ what it calls ‘leaders’ from more than 100 countries on sixcontinents. The modus operandi of Common Purpose can becompared with the work of the UK government’s reframing networkthat includes the Behavioural Insights Team ‘nudge unit’ and‘Covid’ reframing specialists at SPI-B. WikiLeaks describedCommon Purpose long ago as ‘a hidden virus in our governmentand schools’ which is unknown to the general public: ‘It recruits andtrains “leaders” to be loyal to the directives of Common Purpose andthe EU, instead of to their own departments, which they thenundermine or subvert, the NHS [National Health Service] being anexample.’ This is a vital point to understand the ‘Covid’ hoax. TheNHS, and its equivalent around the world, has been u\u0000erly reframedin terms of administrators and much of the medical personnel withthe transformation underpinned by recruitment policies. Theoutcome has been the criminal and psychopathic behaviour of the"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"NHS over ‘Covid’ and we have seen the same in every other majorcountry. WikiLeaks said Common Purpose trainees are ‘learning torule without regard to democracy’ and to usher in a police state(current events explained). Common Purpose operated like a ‘glue’and had members in the NHS, BBC, police, legal profession, church,many of Britain’s 7,000 quangos, local councils, the Civil Service,government ministries and Parliament, and controlled many RDA’s(Regional Development Agencies). Here we have one answer forhow and why British institutions and their like in other countrieshave changed so negatively in relation to the public. This furtherexplains how and why the beyond-disgraceful reframed BBC hasbecome a propaganda arm of ‘Covid’ fascism. They are all part of anetwork pursuing the same goal.By 2019 Common Purpose was quoting a figure of 85,000 ‘leaders’that had a\u0000ended its programmes. These ‘students’ of all ages areknown as Common Purpose ‘graduates’ and they consist ofgovernment, state and local government officials and administrators,police chiefs and officers, and a whole range of others operatingwithin the national, local and global establishment. Cressida Dick,Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, is the CommonPurpose graduate who was the ‘Gold Commander’ that oversawwhat can only be described as the murder of Brazilian electricianJean Charles de Menezes in 2005. He was held down bypsychopathic police and shot seven times in the head by apsychopathic lunatic a\u0000er being mistaken for a terrorist when hewas just a bloke going about his day. Dick authorised officers topursue and keep surveillance on de Menezes and ordered that he bestopped from entering the underground train system. Policepsychopaths took her at her word clearly. She was ‘disciplined’ forthis outrage by being promoted – eventually to the top of the ‘Met’police where she has been a disaster.

Founder JuliaMiddleton herself has said:Locally and internationally, Common Purpose graduates will be ‘lighting small fires’ to createchange in their organisations and communities ...

The organisation runs a variety ofeducational programmes for leaders of all ages, backgrounds and sectors, in order to providethem with the inspirational, information and opportunities they need to change the world.Yes, but into what? Since 2020 the answer has become clear.NLP and the Delphi techniqueCommon Purpose would seem to be a perfect name or wouldcommon programming be be\u0000er? One of the foundation methods ofreaching ‘consensus’ (group think) is by se\u0000ing the agenda themeand then encouraging, cajoling or pressuring everyone to agree a‘consensus’ in line with the core theme promoted by CommonPurpose. The methodology involves the ‘Delphi technique’, or anadaption of it, in which opinions are expressed that are summarisedby a ‘facilitator or change agent’ at each stage. Participants are‘encouraged’ to modify their views in the light of what others havesaid. Stage by stage the former individual opinions are merged intogroup consensus which just happens to be what Common Purposewants them to believe. A key part of this is to marginalise anyonerefusing to concede to group think and turn the group against themto apply pressure to conform. We are seeing this very technique usedon the general population to make ‘Covid’ group-thinkers hostile tothose who have seen through the bullshit. People can be reframed byusing perception manipulation methods such as Neuro-LinguisticProgramming (NLP) in which you change perception with the use of"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"carefully constructed language. An NLP website described thetechnique this way:... A method of influencing brain behaviour (the ‘neuro’ part of the phrase) through the use oflanguage (the ‘linguistic’ part) and other types of communication to enable a person to‘recode’ the way the brain responds to stimuli (that’s the ‘programming’) and manifest newand better behaviours. Neuro-Linguistic Programming often incorporates hypnosis and self-hypnosis to help achieve the change (or ‘programming’) that is wanted.British alternative media operation UKColumn has done verydetailed research into Common Purpose over a long period. I quotedco-founder and former naval officer Brian Gerrish in my bookRemember Who You Are, published in 2011, as saying the followingyears before current times:It is interesting that many of the mothers who have had children taken by the State speak ofthe Social Services people being icily cool, emotionless and, as two ladies said in slightlydifferent words, ‘... like little robots’. We know that NLP is cumulative, so people can begiven small imperceptible doses of NLP in a course here, another in a few months, next yearetc. In this way, major changes are accrued in their personality, but the day by day change isalmost unnoticeable.In these and other ways ‘graduates’ have had their perceptionsuniformly reframed and they return to their roles in the institutionsof government, law enforcement, legal profession, military,‘education’, the UK National Health Service and the whole swathe ofthe establishment structure to pursue a common agenda preparingfor the ‘post-industrial’, ‘post-democratic’ society. I say ‘preparing’but we are now there. ‘Post-industrial’ is code for the Great Resetand ‘post-democratic’ is ‘Covid’ fascism. UKColumn has spoken topartners of those who have a\u0000ended Common Purpose ‘training’.They have described how personalities and a\u0000itudes of ‘graduates’changed very noticeably for the worse by the time they hadcompleted the course.

Thesepersonalities are identified using ‘psychometrics’ that identifiesknowledge, abilities, a\u0000itudes and personality traits, mostly throughcarefully-designed questionnaires and tests. As this policy haspassed through the decades we have had power-crazy, power-trippers appointed into law enforcement, security and governmentadministration in preparation for current times and the dynamicbetween public and law enforcement/officialdom has beentransformed. UKColumn’s Brian Gerrish said of the narcissisticpersonality:Their love of themselves and power automatically means that they will crush others who getin their way. I received a major piece of the puzzle when a friend pointed out that when theymade public officials re-apply for their own jobs several years ago they were also required todo psychometric tests.

At the same timechildren are allowed to be abused without response while many areunder council ‘care’.

Today they wear their face-nappieslike good li\u0000le gofers and enforce ‘Covid’ rules which are fascismunder another name.

Normal people say this is political correctness gonemad. Nothing could be further from the truth. The policeman has been reframed, and in hisreality it is perfect common sense not to get on the bike ‘because he hasn’t done the cyclingcourse’.Another example of this is where the police would not rescue a boy from a pond until theyhad taken advice from above on the ‘risk assessment’. A normal person would have arrived,perhaps thought of the risk for a moment, and dived in. To the police now ‘reframed’, theyfollowed ‘normal’ procedure.There are shocking cases of reframed ambulance crews doing thesame.

There are thousands of examples around the world, butI’ll make my point with the infamous Derbyshire police in theEnglish East Midlands – the ones who think pouring dye into beautyspots and using drones to track people walking in the countrysideaway from anyone is called ‘policing’. To them there are rulesdecreed by the government which they have to enforce and in theirbewildered state a group gathering in a closed space and someonewalking alone in the countryside are the same thing.

Reframed people don’t think – others think forthem and that’s the whole idea of reframing.

The Cult has beenpouring billions into taking complete control of ‘education’ fromschools to universities via its operatives and corporations and notleast Bill Gates as always. The plan has been to transform ‘education’institutions into programming centres for the mentality of ‘Woke’.James McConnell, professor of psychology at the University ofMichigan, wrote in Psychology Today in 1970:The day has come when we can combine sensory deprivation with drugs, hypnosis, andastute manipulation of reward and punishment, to gain almost absolute control over anindividual’s behaviour. It should then be possible to achieve a very rapid and highly effectivetype of brainwashing that would allow us to make dramatic changes in a person’s behaviourand personality ...... We should reshape society so that we all would be trained from birth to want to do whatsociety wants us to do. We have the techniques to do it... no-one owns his own personalityyou acquired, and there’s no reason to believe you should have the right to refuse to acquire anew personality if your old one is anti-social.This was the potential for mass brainwashing in 1970 and thementality there displayed captures the arrogant psychopathy thatdrives it forward. I emphasise that not all young people havesuccumbed to Woke programming and those that haven’t areincredibly impressive people given that today’s young are the mostperceptually-targeted generations in history with all the technologynow involved. Vast swathes of the young generations, however, havefallen into the spell – and that’s what it is – of Woke. The Wokementality and perceptual program is founded on inversion and youwill appreciate later why that is so significant. Everything with Wokeis inverted and the opposite of what it is claimed to be. Woke was aterm used in African-American culture from the 1900s and referredto an awareness of social and racial justice.

It is the driver ofpolitical correctness which is nothing more than a Cult inventionto manipulate the population to silence itself.Woke believes itself to be ‘liberal’ while pursuing a global societythat can only be described as fascist (see ‘anti-fascist’ fascistAntifa).Woke calls for ‘social justice’ while spreading injustice wherever itgoes against the common ‘enemy’ which can be easily identifiedas a differing view.Woke is supposed to be a metaphor for ‘awake’ when it is solid-gold asleep and deep in a Cult-induced coma that meets thecriteria for ‘off with the fairies’.I state these points as obvious facts if people only care to look.

Group-think is always underpinned byconsequences for not group-thinking. Abuse now aimed at thoserefusing DNA-manipulating ‘Covid vaccines’ are a potent exampleof this. The biggest pressure to conform comes from the very groupwhich is itself being manipulated. ‘I am programmed to be part of ahive mind and so you must be.’Woke control structures in ‘education’ now apply to everymainstream organisation.

It is indeed not a race war but a class war and colour isjust a diversion. Black Senator Cory Booker and blackCongresswoman Maxine Waters, more residents of Nincompoopia,personify this.

Instead"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"we have: ‘You are only in your situation because of whitey – turn onthem and everything will change.’ It won’t change. Nothing changesin our lives unless we change it. Crucial to that is never seeingyourself as a victim and always as the creator of your reality. Life is asimple sequence of choice and consequence. Make different choicesand you create different consequences. You have to make thosechoices – not Black Lives Ma\u0000er, the Woke Mafia and anyone elsethat seeks to dictate your life. Who are they these Wokers, anemotional and psychological road traffic accident, to tell you what todo? Personal empowerment is the last thing the Cult and its BlackLives Ma\u0000er want black people or anyone else to have. They claim tobe defending the underdog while creating and perpetuating theunderdog. The Cult’s worst nightmare is human unity and if theyare going to keep blacks, whites and every other race undereconomic servitude and control then the focus must be divertedfrom what they have in common to what they can be manipulated tobelieve divides them. Blacks have to be told that their poverty andplight is the fault of the white bloke living on the street in the samepoverty and with the same plight they are experiencing. Thedifference is that your plight black people is due to him, a whitesupremacist with ‘white privilege’ living on the street. Don’t unite asone human family against your mutual oppressors and suppressors– fight the oppressor with the white face who is as financiallydeprived as you are. The Cult knows that as its ‘Covid’ agendamoves into still new levels of extremism people are going to respondand it has been spreading the seeds of disunity everywhere to stop aunited response to the evil that targets all of us.Racist a\u0000acks on ‘whiteness’ are ge\u0000ing ever more outrageous andespecially through the American Democratic Party which has anappalling history for anti-black racism. Barack Obama, Joe Biden,Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi all eulogised about Senator RobertByrd at his funeral in 2010 a\u0000er a nearly 60-year career in Congress.Byrd was a brutal Ku Klux Klan racist and a violent abuser of CathyO’Brien in MKUltra. He said he would never fight in the military‘with a negro by my side’ and ‘rather I should die a thousand times,"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than tosee this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, athrowback to the blackest specimen from the wilds’. Biden calledByrd a ‘very close friend and mentor’. These ‘Woke’ hypocrites arenot anti-racist they are anti-poor and anti-people not of theirperceived class. Here is an illustration of the scale of anti-whiteracism to which we have now descended. Seriously Woke andmoronic New York Times contributor Damon Young describedwhiteness as a ‘virus’ that ‘like other viruses will not die until thereare no bodies le\u0000 for it to infect’. He went on: ‘... the only way tostop it is to locate it, isolate it, extract it, and kill it.’ Young can saythat as a black man with no consequences when a white man sayingthe same in reverse would be facing a jail sentence. That’s racism. Wehad super-Woke numbskull senators Tammy Duckworth and MazieHirono saying they would object to future Biden Cabinetappointments if he did not nominate more Asian Americans andPacific Islanders. Never mind the ability of the candidate what dothey look like? Duckworth said: ‘I will vote for racial minorities and Iwill vote for LGBTQ, but anyone else I’m not voting for.’ Appointingpeople on the grounds of race is illegal, but that was not a problemfor this ludicrous pair. They were on-message and that’s a free passin any situation.Critical race racismWhite children are told at school they are intrinsically racist as theyare taught the divisive ‘critical race theory’. This claims that the lawand legal institutions are inherently racist and that race is a sociallyconstructed concept used by white people to further their economicand political interests at the expense of people of colour. White is a‘virus’ as we’ve seen. Racial inequality results from ‘social,economic, and legal differences that white people create betweenraces to maintain white interests which leads to poverty andcriminality in minority communities‘. I must tell that to the whiteguy sleeping on the street. The principal of East Side CommunitySchool in New York sent white parents a manifesto that called on"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"them to become ‘white traitors’ and advocate for full ‘whiteabolition’. These people are teaching your kids when they urgentlyneed a psychiatrist. The ‘school’ included a chart with ‘eight whiteidentities’ that ranged from ‘white supremacist’ to ‘white abolition’and defined the behaviour white people must follow to end ‘theregime of whiteness’. Woke blacks and their privileged whiteassociates are acting exactly like the slave owners of old and Ku KluxKlan racists like Robert Byrd. They are too full of their own self-purity to see that, but it’s true. Racism is not a body type; it’s a stateof mind that can manifest through any colour, creed or culture.Another racial fraud is ‘equity’. Not equality of treatment andopportunity – equity. It’s a term spun as equality when it meanssomething very different. Equality in its true sense is a raising upwhile ‘equity’ is a race to the bo\u0000om. Everyone in the same level ofpoverty is ‘equity’. Keep everyone down – that’s equity. The Cultdoesn’t want anyone in the human family to be empowered andBLM leaders, like all these ‘anti-racist’ organisations, continue theirprivileged, pampered existence by perpetuating the perception ofgathering racism. When is the last time you heard an ‘anti-racist’ or‘anti-Semitism’ organisation say that acts of racism anddiscrimination have fallen? It’s not in the interests of their fund-raising and power to influence and the same goes for theprofessional soccer anti-racism operation, Kick It Out.

Now reduce that by 35 percent and you have to come down to50 million tonnes, I’ve done the maths. So if you take for example 1.5 million cows, you’regoing to have to reduce the herd by 525,000 [by] 2030, nine years, that’s 58,000 cows a year.The beef herd’s 30 million, reduce that by 35 percent, that’s 10.5 million, which means 1.2million cattle have to go every year between now and 2030. This is insanity!There are 75 million sheep. Reduce that by 35 percent, that’s 26 million sheep, that’s almost 3million a year.

How insane thenthat psychopathic madman Gates is not satisfied only with blockingthe rise of Co2. He’s funding technology to suck it out of theatmosphere. The reason why will become clear. The industrial era isnot destroying the world through Co2 and has instead turnedaround a potentially disastrous ongoing fall in Co2. Greenpeace co-founder and scientist Patrick Moore walked away from Greenpeacein 1986 and has exposed the green movement for fear-mongeringand lies. He said that 500 million years ago there was 17 times moreCo2 in the atmosphere than we have today and levels have beenfalling for hundreds of millions of years. In the last 150 million yearsCo2 levels in Earth’s atmosphere had reduced by 90 percent. Mooresaid that by the time humanity began to unlock carbon dioxide fromfossil fuels we were at ‘38 seconds to midnight’ and in that sense:‘Humans are [the Earth’s] salvation.’ Moore made the point that onlyhalf the Co2 emi\u0000ed by fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere and weshould remember that all pollution pouring from chimneys that weare told is carbon dioxide is in fact nothing of the kind. It’s pollution.Carbon dioxide is an invisible gas.William Happer, Professor of Physics at Princeton University andlong-time government adviser on climate, has emphasised the Co2deficiency for maximum growth and food production.

You hear puppet Greta goingon cluelessly about feedback loops and this is why.The Sun affects temperature? No you climate denierSome other nonsense to contemplate: Climate graphs show that risesin temperature do not follow rises in Co2 – it’s the other way roundwith a lag between the two of some 800 years. If we go back 800years from present time we hit the Medieval Warm Period whentemperatures were higher than now without any industrialisationand this was followed by the Li\u0000le Ice Age when temperaturesplummeted. The world was still emerging from these centuries ofserious cold when many climate records began which makes theever-repeated line of the ‘ho\u0000est year since records began’meaningless when you are not comparing like with like. The coldestperiod of the Li\u0000le Ice Age corresponded with the lowest period ofsunspot activity when the Sun was at its least active. Properscientists will not be at all surprised by this when it confirms theobvious fact that earth temperature is affected by the scale of Sunactivity and the energetic power that it subsequently emits; butwhen is the last time you heard a climate hoaxer talking about theSun as a source of earth temperature?? Everything has to be focussedon Co2 which makes up just 0.117 percent of so-called greenhousegases and only a fraction of even that is generated by human activity.The rest is natural.

I have quoted from US military documentsdetailing how to employ weather manipulation as a weapon of warand they did that in the 1960s and 70s during the conflict in Vietnamwith Operation Popeye manipulating monsoon rains for militarypurposes. Why would there be international treaties on weathermodification if it wasn’t possible? Of course it is. Weather isenergetic information and it can be changed.How was the climate hoax pulled off? See ‘Covid’If you can get billions to believe in a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist you canget them to believe in human-caused climate change that doesn’texist.

A great percentage of thepopulation believe what they are told as the lie becomes aneverybody-knows-that and the believing-masses turn on those witha mind of their own. The technique has been used endlesslythroughout human history. Wokers are the biggest promotors of theclimate lie and ‘Covid’ fascism because their minds are owned by theCult; their sense of self-righteous self-purity knows no bounds; andthey exist in a bubble of reality in which facts are irrelevant and onlyget in the way of looking without seeing.Running through all of this like veins in a blue cheese is control ofinformation, which means control of perception, which meanscontrol of behaviour, which collectively means control of humansociety.

But I won’t back downTom Pettywill now focus on the genetically-manipulating ‘Covid vaccines’which do not meet this official definition of a vaccine by the USCenters for Disease Control (CDC): ‘A product that stimulates aperson’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease,protecting the person from that disease.’ On that basis ‘Covidvaccines’ are not a vaccine in that the makers don’t even claim theystop infection or transmission.They are instead part of a multi-levelled conspiracy to change thenature of the human body and what it means to be ‘human’ and todepopulate an enormous swathe of humanity. What I shall callHuman 1.0 is on the cusp of becoming Human 2.0 and for verysinister reasons. Before I get to the ‘Covid vaccine’ in detail here’ssome background to vaccines in general. Government regulators donot test vaccines – the makers do – and the makers control whichdata is revealed and which isn’t. Children in America are given 50vaccine doses by age six and 69 by age 19 and the effect of the wholecombined schedule has never been tested. Autoimmune diseaseswhen the immune system a\u0000acks its own body have soared in themass vaccine era and so has disease in general in children and theyoung. Why wouldn’t this be the case when vaccines target theimmune system? The US government gave Big Pharma drug"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"companies immunity from prosecution for vaccine death and injuryin the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) andsince then the government (taxpayer) has been fundingcompensation for the consequences of Big Pharma vaccines. Thecriminal and satanic drug giants can’t lose and the vaccine schedulehas increased dramatically since 1986 for this reason. There is noincentive to make vaccines safe and a big incentive to make moneyby introducing ever more. Even against a ridiculously high bar toprove vaccine liability, and with the government controlling thehearing in which it is being challenged for compensation, the vaccinecourt has so far paid out more than $4 billion. These are the vaccineswe are told are safe and psychopaths like Zuckerberg censor postssaying otherwise. The immunity law was even justified by a rulingthat vaccines by their nature were ‘unavoidably unsafe’.Check out the ingredients of vaccines and you will be shocked ifyou are new to this. They put that in children’s bodies?? What?? Tryaluminium, a brain toxin connected to dementia, aborted foetaltissue and formaldehyde which is used to embalm corpses. World-renowned aluminium expert Christopher Exley had his research intothe health effect of aluminium in vaccines shut down by KeeleUniversity in the UK when it began taking funding from the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation. Research when diseases ‘eradicated’ byvaccines began to decline and you will find the fall began long beforethe vaccine was introduced. Sometimes the fall even plateaued a\u0000erthe vaccine. Diseases like scarlet fever for which there was novaccine declined in the same way because of environmental andother factors. A perfect case in point is the polio vaccine. Polio beganwhen lead arsenate was first sprayed as an insecticide and residuesremained in food products. Spraying started in 1892 and the first USpolio epidemic came in Vermont in 1894. The simple answer was tostop spraying, but Rockefeller-created Big Pharma had a be\u0000er idea.Polio was decreed to be caused by the poliovirus which ‘spreads fromperson to person and can infect a person’s spinal cord’. Leadarsenate was replaced by the lethal DDT which had the same effectof causing paralysis by damaging the brain and central nervous"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"system. Polio plummeted when DDT was reduced and then banned,but the vaccine is still given the credit for something it didn’t do.Today by far the biggest cause of polio is the vaccines promoted byBill Gates. Vaccine justice campaigner Robert Kennedy Jr, son ofassassinated (by the Cult) US A\u0000orney General Robert Kennedy,wrote:In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosionin polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo,Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of globalpolio cases were vaccine strain.Vaccines make fortunes for Cult-owned Gates and Big Pharmawhile undermining the health and immune systems of thepopulation. We had a glimpse of the mentality behind the BigPharma cartel with a report on WION (World is One News), aninternational English language TV station based in India, whichexposed the extraordinary behaviour of US drug company Pfizerover its ‘Covid vaccine’. The WION report told how Pfizer had madefantastic demands of Argentina, Brazil and other countries in returnfor its ‘vaccine’. These included immunity from prosecution, evenfor Pfizer negligence, government insurance to protect Pfizer fromlaw suits and handing over as collateral sovereign assets of thecountry to include Argentina’s bank reserves, military bases andembassy buildings. Pfizer demanded the same of Brazil in the formof waiving sovereignty of its assets abroad; exempting Pfizer fromBrazilian laws; and giving Pfizer immunity from all civil liability.This is a ‘vaccine’ developed with government funding. Big Pharmais evil incarnate as a creation of the Cult and all must be handedtickets to Nuremberg.Phantom ‘vaccine’ for a phantom ‘disease’I’ll expose the ‘Covid vaccine’ fraud and then go on to the widerbackground of why the Cult has set out to ‘vaccinate’ every man,woman and child on the planet for an alleged ‘new disease’ with asurvival rate of 99.77 percent (or more) even by the grotesquely-"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"manipulated figures of the World Health Organization and JohnsHopkins University. The ‘infection’ to ‘death’ ratio is 0.23 to 0.15percent according to Stanford epidemiologist Dr John Ioannidis andwhile estimates vary the danger remains tiny. I say that if the truthbe told the fake infection to fake death ratio is zero. Never mind allthe evidence I have presented here and in The Answer that there is no‘virus’ let us just focus for a moment on that death-rate figure of say0.23 percent. The figure includes all those worldwide who havetested positive with a test not testing for the ‘virus’ and then diedwithin 28 days or even longer of any other cause – any other cause.Now subtract all those illusory ‘Covid’ deaths on the global datasheets from the 0.23 percent. What do you think you would be le\u0000with? Zero. A vaccination has never been successfully developed fora so-called coronavirus. They have all failed at the animal testingstage when they caused hypersensitivity to what they were claimingto protect against and made the impact of a disease far worse. Cult-owned vaccine corporations got around that problem this time bybypassing animal trials, going straight to humans and making thelength of the ‘trials’ before the public rollout as short as they couldget away with. Normally it takes five to ten years or more to developvaccines that still cause demonstrable harm to many people andthat’s without including the long-term effects that are never officiallyconnected to the vaccination. ‘Covid’ non-vaccines have beenofficially produced and approved in a ma\u0000er of months from astanding start and part of the reason is that (a) they were developedbefore the ‘Covid’ hoax began and (b) they are based on computerprograms and not natural sources. Official non-trials were so shortthat government agencies gave emergency, not full, approval. ‘Trials’were not even completed and full approval cannot be secured untilthey are. Public ‘Covid vaccination’ is actually a continuation of thetrial. Drug company ‘trials’ are not scheduled to end until 2023 bywhich time a lot of people are going to be dead. Data on whichgovernment agencies gave this emergency approval was supplied bythe Big Pharma corporations themselves in the form ofPfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"others, and this is the case with all vaccines. By its very natureemergency approval means drug companies do not have to prove thatthe ‘vaccine’ is ‘safe and effective’. How could they with trials wayshort of complete? Government regulators only have to believe thatthey could be safe and effective. It is criminal manipulation to getproducts in circulation with no testing worth the name. Agenciesgiving that approval are infested with Big Pharma-connected place-people and they act in the interests of Big Pharma (the Cult) and notthe public about whom they do not give a damn.More human lab rats‘Covid vaccines’ produced in record time by Pfizer/BioNTech andModerna employ a technique never approved before for use on humans.They are known as mRNA ‘vaccines’ and inject a synthetic version of‘viral’ mRNA or ‘messenger RNA’. The key is in the term‘messenger’. The body works, or doesn’t, on the basis of informationmessaging. Communications are constantly passing between andwithin the genetic system and the brain. Change those messages andyou change the state of the body and even its very nature and youcan change psychology and behaviour by the way the brainprocesses information. I think you are going to see significantchanges in personality and perception of many people who have hadthe ‘Covid vaccine’ synthetic potions. Insider Aldous Huxleypredicted the following in 1961 and mRNA ‘vaccines’ can beincluded in the term ‘pharmacological methods’:There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people lovetheir servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind ofpainless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their ownliberties taken away from them, but rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from anydesire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced bypharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.Apologists claim that mRNA synthetic ‘vaccines’ don’t change theDNA genetic blueprint because RNA does not affect DNA only theother way round. This is so disingenuous. A process called ‘reverse"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"transcription’ can convert RNA into DNA and be integrated intoDNA in the cell nucleus. This was highlighted in December, 2020, byscientists at Harvard and Massachuse\u0000s Institute of Technology(MIT). Geneticists report that more than 40 percent of mammaliangenomes results from reverse transcription. On the most basic levelif messaging changes then that sequence must lead to changes inDNA which is receiving and transmi\u0000ing those communications.How can introducing synthetic material into cells not change thecells where DNA is located? The process is known as transfectionwhich is defined as ‘a technique to insert foreign nucleic acid (DNAor RNA) into a cell, typically with the intention of altering theproperties of the cell’. Researchers at the Sloan Ke\u0000ering Institute inNew York found that changes in messenger RNA can deactivatetumour-suppressing proteins and thereby promote cancer. This iswhat happens when you mess with messaging. ‘Covid vaccine’maker Moderna was founded in 2010 by Canadian stem cellbiologist Derrick J. Rossi a\u0000er his breakthrough discovery in the fieldof transforming and reprogramming stem cells. These are neutralcells that can be programmed to become any cell including spermcells. Moderna was therefore founded on the principle of geneticmanipulation and has never produced any vaccine or drug before itsgenetically-manipulating synthetic ‘Covid’ shite. Look at the name –Mode-RNA or Modify-RNA. Another important point is that the USSupreme Court has ruled that genetically-modified DNA, orcomplementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized in the laboratory frommessenger RNA, can be patented and owned. These psychopaths aredoing this to the human body.Cells replicate synthetic mRNA in the ‘Covid vaccines’ and intheory the body is tricked into making antigens which triggerantibodies to target the ‘virus spike proteins’ which as Dr TomCowan said have never been seen. Cut the crap and these ‘vaccines’deliver self-replicating synthetic material to the cells with the effect ofchanging human DNA. The more of them you have the more thatprocess is compounded while synthetic material is all the time self-replicating. ‘Vaccine’-maker Moderna describes mRNA as ‘like"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"so\u0000ware for the cell’ and so they are messing with the body’sso\u0000ware. What happens when you change the so\u0000ware in acomputer? Everything changes. For this reason the Cult is preparinga production line of mRNA ‘Covid vaccines’ and a long list ofexcuses to use them as with all the ‘variants’ of a ‘virus’ never shownto exist. The plan is further to transfer the mRNA technique to othervaccines mostly given to children and young people. The cumulativeconsequences will be a transformation of human DNA through aconstant infusion of synthetic genetic material which will kill manyand change the rest. Now consider that governments that have givenemergency approval for a vaccine that’s not a vaccine; never beenapproved for humans before; had no testing worth the name; andthe makers have been given immunity from prosecution for anydeaths or adverse effects suffered by the public. The UK governmentawarded permanent legal indemnity to itself and its employees forharm done when a patient is being treated for ‘Covid-19’ or‘suspected Covid-19’. That is quite a thought when these are possible‘side-effects’ from the ‘vaccine’ (they are not ‘side’, they are effects)listed by the US Food and Drug Administration:Guillain-Barre syndrome; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis;transverse myelitis; encephalitis; myelitis; encephalomyelitis;meningoencephalitis; meningitis; encephalopathy; convulsions;seizures; stroke; narcolepsy; cataplexy; anaphylaxis; acutemyocardial infarction (heart a\u0000ack); myocarditis; pericarditis;autoimmune disease; death; implications for pregnancy, and birthoutcomes; other acute demyelinating diseases; non anaphylacticallergy reactions; thrombocytopenia ; disseminated intravascularcoagulation; venous thromboembolism; arthritis; arthralgia; jointpain; Kawasaki disease; multisystem inflammatory syndrome inchildren; vaccine enhanced disease.

Yeadon worked onthe inside of Big Pharma, but that did not stop him becoming a vocalcritic of ‘Covid vaccines’ and their potential for multiple harms,including infertility in women. By the spring of 2021 he went muchfurther and even used the no, no, term ‘conspiracy’. When you beginto see what is going on it is impossible not to do so. Yeadon spokeout in an interview with freedom campaigner James Delingpole andI mentioned earlier how he said that no one had samples of ‘thevirus’. He explained that the mRNA technique originated in the anti-cancer field and ways to turn on and off certain genes which couldbe advantageous if you wanted to stop cancer growing out ofcontrol. ‘That’s the origin of them. They are a very unusualapplication, really.’ Yeadon said that treating a cancer patient withan aggressive procedure might be understandable if the alternativewas dying, but it was quite another thing to use the same techniqueas a public health measure. Most people involved wouldn’t catch theinfectious agent you were vaccinating against and if they did theyprobably wouldn’t die:If you are really using it as a public health measure you really want to as close as you can getto zero sides-effects ... I find it odd that they chose techniques that were really cutting theirteeth in the field of oncology and I’m worried that in using gene-based vaccines that have tobe injected in the body and spread around the body, get taken up into some cells, and theregulators haven’t quite told us which cells they get taken up into ... you are going to begenerating a wide range of responses ... with multiple steps each of which could go well orbadly."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"I doubt the Cult intends it to go well. Yeadon said that you can putany gene you like into the body through the ‘vaccine’. ‘You cancertainly give them a gene that would do them some harm if youwanted.’ I was intrigued when he said that when used in the cancerfield the technique could turn genes on and off. I explore this processin The Answer and with different genes having different functionsyou could create mayhem – physically and psychologically – if youturned the wrong ones on and the right ones off. I read reports of anexperiment by researchers at the University of Washington’s schoolof computer science and engineering in which they encoded DNA toinfect computers. The body is itself a biological computer and ifhuman DNA can inflict damage on a computer why can’t thecomputer via synthetic material mess with the human body? It can.The Washington research team said it was possible to insertmalicious malware into ‘physical DNA strands’ and corrupt thecomputer system of a gene sequencing machine as it ‘reads genele\u0000ers and stores them as binary digits 0 and 1’. They concluded thathackers could one day use blood or spit samples to access computersystems and obtain sensitive data from police forensics labs or infectgenome files. It is at this level of digital interaction that synthetic‘vaccines’ need to be seen to get the full picture and that will becomevery clear later on. Michael Yeadon said it made no sense to give the‘vaccine’ to younger people who were in no danger from the ‘virus’.What was the benefit? It was all downside with potential effects:The fact that my government in what I thought was a civilised, rational country, is raining [the‘vaccine’] on people in their 30s and 40s, even my children in their 20s, they’re getting lettersand phone calls, I know this is not right and any of you doctors who are vaccinating youknow it’s not right, too. They are not at risk. They are not at risk from the disease, so you arenow hoping that the side-effects are so rare that you get away with it. You don’t give newtechnology ... that you don’t understand to 100 percent of the population.Blood clot problems with the AstraZeneca ‘vaccine’ have beenaffecting younger people to emphasise the downside risks with nobenefit. AstraZeneca’s version, produced with Oxford University,does not use mRNA, but still gets its toxic cocktail inside cells where"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"it targets DNA. The Johnson & Johnson ‘vaccine’ which uses asimilar technique has also produced blood clot effects to such anextent that the United States paused its use at one point. They are all‘gene therapy’ (cell modification) procedures and not ‘vaccines’. Thetruth is that once the content of these injections enter cells we haveno idea what the effect will be. People can speculate and some cangive very educated opinions and that’s good. In the end, though,only the makers know what their potions are designed to do andeven they won’t know every last consequence. Michael Yeadon wasscathing about doctors doing what they knew to be wrong.‘Everyone’s mute’, he said. Doctors in the NHS must know this wasnot right, coming into work and injecting people. ‘I don’t know howthey sleep at night. I know I couldn’t do it. I know that if I were inthat position I’d have to quit.’ He said he knew enough abouttoxicology to know this was not a good risk-benefit. Yeadon hadspoken to seven or eight university professors and all except twowould not speak out publicly. Their universities had a policy that noone said anything that countered the government and its medicaladvisors. They were afraid of losing their government grants. This ishow intimidation has been used to silence the truth at every level ofthe system. I say silence, but these people could still speak out if theymade that choice. Yeadon called them ‘moral cowards’ – ‘This isabout your children and grandchildren’s lives and you have justbuggered off and le\u0000 it.’‘Variant’ nonsenseSome of his most powerful comments related to the alleged‘variants’ being used to instil more fear, justify more lockdowns, andintroduce more ‘vaccines’. He said government claims about‘variants’ were nonsense. He had checked the alleged variant ‘codes’and they were 99.7 percent identical to the ‘original’. This was thehuman identity difference equivalent to pu\u0000ing a baseball cap onand off or wearing it the other way round. A 0.3 percent differencewould make it impossible for that ‘variant’ to escape immunity fromthe ‘original’. This made no sense of having new ‘vaccines’ for"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"‘variants’. He said there would have to be at least a 30 percentdifference for that to be justified and even then he believed theimmune system would still recognise what it was. Gates-funded‘variant modeller’ and ‘vaccine’-pusher John Edmunds might care tocomment. Yeadon said drug companies were making new versionsof the ‘vaccine’ as a ‘top up’ for ‘variants’. Worse than that, he said,the ‘regulators’ around the world like the MHRA in the UK had gottogether and agreed that because ‘vaccines’ for ‘variants’ were sosimilar to the first ‘vaccines’ they did not have to do safety studies. Howtransparently sinister that is. This is when Yeadon said: ‘There is aconspiracy here.’ There was no need for another vaccine for‘variants’ and yet we were told that there was and the country hadshut its borders because of them. ‘They are going into hundreds ofmillions of arms without passing ‘go’ or any regulator. Why did theydo that? Why did they pick this method of making the vaccine?’The reason had to be something bigger than that it seemed and‘it’s not protection against the virus’. It’s was a far bigger project thatmeant politicians and advisers were willing to do things and not dothings that knowingly resulted in avoidable deaths – ‘that’s alreadyhappened when you think about lockdown and deprivation ofhealth care for a year.’ He spoke of people prepared to do somethingthat results in the avoidable death of their fellow human beings andit not bother them. This is the penny-drop I have been working toget across for more than 30 years – the level of pure evil we aredealing with. Yeadon said his friends and associates could notbelieve there could be that much evil, but he reminded them ofStalin, Pol Pot and Hitler and of what Stalin had said: ‘One death is atragedy. A million? A statistic.’ He could not think of a benignexplanation for why you need top-up vaccines ‘which I’m sure youdon’t’ and for the regulators ‘to just get out of the way and wavethem through’. Why would the regulators do that when they werestill wrestling with the dangers of the ‘parent’ vaccine? He wasclearly shocked by what he had seen since the ‘Covid’ hoax beganand now he was thinking the previously unthinkable:"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"If you wanted to depopulate a significant proportion of the world and to do it in a way thatdoesn’t involve destruction of the environment with nuclear weapons, poisoning everyonewith anthrax or something like that, and you wanted plausible deniability while you had amulti-year infectious disease crisis, I actually don’t think you could come up with a better planof work than seems to be in front of me. I can’t say that’s what they are going to do, but I can’tthink of a benign explanation why they are doing it.He said he never thought that they would get rid of 99 percent ofhumans, but now he wondered. ‘If you wanted to that this would bea hell of a way to do it – it would be unstoppable folks.’ Yeadon hadconcluded that those who submi\u0000ed to the ‘vaccine’ would beallowed to have some kind of normal life (but for how long?) whilescrews were tightened to coerce and mandate the last few percent. ‘Ithink they’ll put the rest of them in a prison camp. I wish I waswrong, but I don’t think I am.’ Other points he made included: Therewere no coronavirus vaccines then suddenly they all come along atthe same time; we have no idea of the long term affect with trials soshort; coercing or forcing people to have medical procedures isagainst the Nuremberg Code instigated when the Nazis did just that;people should at least delay having the ‘vaccine’; a quick Internetsearch confirms that masks don’t reduce respiratory viraltransmission and ‘the government knows that’; they have smashedcivil society and they know that, too; two dozen peer-reviewedstudies show no connection between lockdown and reducing deaths;he knew from personal friends the elite were still flying around andgoing on holiday while the public were locked down; the elite werenot having the ‘vaccines’. He was also asked if ‘vaccines’ could bemade to target difference races. He said he didn’t know, but thedocument by the Project for the New American Century inSeptember, 2000, said developing ‘advanced forms of biologicalwarfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biologicalwarfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.’ Oh,they’re evil all right. Of that we can be absolutely sure.Another cull of old people"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"We have seen from the CDC definition that the mRNA ‘Covidvaccine’ is not a vaccine and nor are the others that claim to reduce‘severity of symptoms’ in some people, but not protect from infectionor transmission.

If they are not claimed to stop infectionand transmission of the alleged ‘virus’, how does anything change?This was all lies to manipulate people to take the jabs and we areseeing that now with masks and distancing still required for the‘vaccinated’. How did they think that elderly people with fragilehealth and immune responses were going to be affected by infusingtheir cells with synthetic material and other toxic substances? Theyknew that in the short and long term it would be devastating andfatal as the culling of the old that began with the first lockdowns wascontinued with the ‘vaccine’. Death rates in care homes soaredimmediately residents began to be ‘vaccinated’ – infused withsynthetic material. Brave and commi\u0000ed whistleblower nurses puttheir careers at risk by exposing this truth while the rest kept theirheads down and their mouths shut to put their careers before thosethey are supposed to care for. A long-time American CertifiedNursing Assistant who gave his name as James posted a video inwhich he described emotionally what happened in his care homewhen vaccination began. He said that during 2020 very few residentswere sick with ‘Covid’ and no one died during the entire year; butshortly a\u0000er the Pfizer mRNA injections 14 people died within twoweeks and many others were near death. ‘They’re dropping likeflies’, he said. Residents who walked on their own before the shotcould no longer and they had lost their ability to conduct anintelligent conversation. The home’s management said the suddendeaths were caused by a ‘super-spreader’ of ‘Covid-19’. Then howcome, James asked, that residents who refused to take the injectionswere not sick? It was a case of inject the elderly with mRNAsynthetic potions and blame their illness and death that followed onthe ‘virus’. James described what was happening in care homes as‘the greatest crime of genocide this country has ever seen’.Remember the NHS staff nurse from earlier who used the same"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"word ‘genocide’ for what was happening with the ‘vaccines’ andthat it was an ‘act of human annihilation’. A UK care homewhistleblower told a similar story to James about the effect of the‘vaccine’ in deaths and ‘outbreaks’ of illness dubbed ‘Covid’ a\u0000erge\u0000ing the jab. She told how her care home management and staffhad zealously imposed government regulations and no one wasallowed to even question the official narrative let alone speak outagainst it. She said the NHS was even worse. Again we see theresults of reframing. A worker at a local care home where I live saidthey had not had a single case of ‘Covid’ there for almost a year andwhen the residents were ‘vaccinated’ they had 19 positive cases intwo weeks with eight dying.It’s not the ‘vaccine’ – honestThe obvious cause and effect was being ignored by the media andmost of the public. Australia’s health minister Greg Hunt (a formerhead of strategy at the World Economic Forum) was admi\u0000ed tohospital a\u0000er he had the ‘vaccine’. He was suffering according toreports from the skin infection ‘cellulitis’ and it must have been asevere case to have warranted days in hospital. Immediately theauthorities said this was nothing to do with the ‘vaccine’ when aneffect of some vaccines is a ‘cellulitis-like reaction’. We had familiesof perfectly healthy old people who died a\u0000er the ‘vaccine’ sayingthat if only they had been given the ‘vaccine’ earlier they would stillbe alive. As a numbskull rating that is off the chart. A father of four‘died of Covid’ at aged 48 when he was taken ill two days a\u0000erhaving the ‘vaccine’. The man, a health administrator, had been‘shielding during the pandemic’ and had ‘not really le\u0000 the house’until he went for the ‘vaccine’. Having the ‘vaccine’ and then fallingill and dying does not seem to have qualified as a possible cause andeffect and ‘Covid-19’ went on his death certificate. His family saidthey had no idea how he ‘caught the virus’. A family member said:‘Tragically, it could be that going for a vaccination ultimately led tohim catching Covid ...The sad truth is that they are never going toknow where it came from.’ The family warned people to remember"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"that the virus still existed and was ‘very real’. So was their stupidity.Nurses and doctors who had the first round of the ‘vaccine’ werecollapsing, dying and ending up in a hospital bed while they or theirgrieving relatives were saying they’d still have the ‘vaccine’ againdespite what happened. I kid you not. You mean if your husbandreturned from the dead he’d have the same ‘vaccine’ again that killedhim??Doctors at the VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, saidthe Johnson & Johnson ‘vaccine’ was to blame for a man’s skinpeeling off. Patient Richard Terrell said: ‘It all just happened so fast.My skin peeled off.

Mass lying is the new normal of the ‘Covid’ era. TheMHRA later said 30 cases of rare blood clots had by then beenconnected with the AstraZeneca ‘vaccine’ (that means a lot more inreality) while stressing that the benefits of the jab in preventing‘Covid-19’ outweighed any risks.

Another woman posted that her husband was transportingstroke patients to hospital on almost every shi\u0000 and when he askedthem if they had been ‘vaccinated’ for ‘Covid’ they all replied ‘yes’.One had a ‘massive brain bleed’ the day a\u0000er his second dose. Shesaid her husband reported the ‘just been vaccinated’ informationevery time to doctors in A and E only for them to ignore it, make nonotes and appear annoyed that it was even mentioned. Thisparticular report cannot be verified, but it expresses a commontheme that confirms the monumental underreporting of ‘vaccine’consequences. Interestingly as the ‘vaccines’ and their brain bloodclot/stroke consequences began to emerge the UK National HealthService began a publicity campaign telling the public what to do inthe event of a stroke. A Sco\u0000ish NHS staff nurse who quit in disgustin March, 2021, said:I have seen traumatic injuries from the vaccine, they’re not getting reported to the yellow card[adverse reaction] scheme, they’re treating the symptoms, not asking why, why it’s happening.It’s just treating the symptoms and when you speak about it you’re dismissed like you’re crazy,I’m not crazy, I’m not crazy because every other colleague I’ve spoken to is terrified to speakout, they’ve had enough.Videos appeared on the Internet of people uncontrollably shakinga\u0000er the ‘vaccine’ with no control over muscles, limbs and even theirface.

The levels ofsickness after vaccination is unprecedented and staff are getting very sick and some withneurological symptoms which is having a huge impact on the health service function. Eventhe young and healthy are off for days, some for weeks, and some requiring medicaltreatment. Whole teams are being taken out as they went to get vaccinated together.Mandatory vaccination in this instance is stupid, unethical and irresponsible when it comes toprotecting our staff and public health. We are in the voluntary phase of vaccination, andencouraging staff to take an unlicensed product that is impacting on their immediate health ...it is clearly stated that these vaccine products do not offer immunity or stop transmission. Inwhich case why are we doing it?Not to protect health that’s for sure. Medical workers are lauded bygovernments for agenda reasons when they couldn’t give a tossabout them any more than they can for the population in general.Schools across America faced the same situation as they closed dueto the high number of teachers and other staff with bad reactions tothe Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson ‘Covidvaccines’ all of which were linked to death and serious adverseeffects.

The cover-up is breathtaking.Hiding the evidenceThe scale of the ‘vaccine’ death cover-up worldwide can beconfirmed by comparing official figures with the personal experienceof the public.

In the UK alone by April 29th, 2021, some 757,654adverse reactions had been officially reported from thePfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna ‘vaccines’ withmore than a thousand deaths linked to jabs and that means anestimated ten times this number in reality from a ten percentreporting rate percentage. That’s seven million adverse reactions and10,000 potential deaths and a one percent reporting rate would beten times those figures. In 1976 the US government pulled the swineflu vaccine a\u0000er 53 deaths. The UK data included a combined 10,000eye disorders from the ‘Covid vaccines’ with more than 750 sufferingvisual impairment or blindness and again multiply by the estimatedreporting percentages. As ‘Covid cases’ officially fell hospitalsvirtually empty during the ‘Covid crisis’ began to fill up with arange of other problems in the wake of the ‘vaccine’ rollout. Thenumbers across America have also been catastrophic. Deaths linkedto all types of vaccine increased by 6,000 percent in the first quarter of2021 compared with 2020. A 39-year-old woman from Ogden, Utah,died four days a\u0000er receiving a second dose of Moderna’s ‘Covidvaccine’ when her liver, heart and kidneys all failed despite the factthat she had no known medical issues or conditions. Her familysought an autopsy, but Dr Erik Christensen, Utah’s chief medicalexaminer, said proving vaccine injury as a cause of death almostnever happened. He could think of only one instance where anautopsy would name a vaccine as the official cause of death and thatwould be anaphylaxis where someone received a vaccine and diedalmost instantaneously. ‘Short of that, it would be difficult for us todefinitively say this is the vaccine,’ Christensen said. If that is truethis must be added to the estimated ten percent (or far less)reporting rate of vaccine deaths and serious reactions and theconclusion can only be that vaccine deaths and serious reactions –including these ‘Covid’ potions’ – are phenomenally understated inofficial figures.

This bore no resemblance towhat people knew had happened in their owns circles and we hadDirk Huyer in charge of ge\u0000ing millions vaccinated in Ontario whileat the same time he was Chief Coroner for the province investigatingcauses of death including possible death from the vaccine. An aidesaid he had stepped back from investigating deaths, but evidenceindicated otherwise. Rosemary Frei, who secured a Master of Sciencedegree in molecular biology at the Faculty of Medicine at Canada’sUniversity of Calgary before turning to investigative journalism, wasone who could see that official figures for ‘vaccine’ deaths andreactions made no sense. She said that doctors seldom reportedadverse events and when people got really sick or died a\u0000er ge\u0000inga vaccination they would a\u0000ribute that to anything except thevaccines. It had been that way for years and anyone who wonderedaloud whether the ‘Covid vaccines’ or other shots cause harm isimmediately branded as ‘anti-vax’ and ‘anti-science’. This was‘career-threatening’ for health professionals. Then there was thehuge pressure to support the push to ‘vaccinate’ billions in thequickest time possible.

The Rockefeller Foundation, which pre-empted the‘Covid pandemic’ in a document published in 2010 that ‘predicted’what happened a decade later, announced an initial $34.95 milliongrant in February, 2021, ‘to ensure more equitable access to Covid-19"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"testing and vaccines’ among other things in Africa in collaborationwith ‘24 organizations, businesses, and government agencies’.

Rajiv Shah, President of the RockefellerFoundation and former administrator of CIA-controlled USAID, saidthat if Africa was not mass-vaccinated (to change the DNA of itspeople) it was a ‘threat to all of humanity’ and not fair on Africans.When someone from the Rockefeller Foundation says they want todo something to help poor and deprived people and countries it istime for a belly-laugh. They are doing this out of the goodness oftheir ‘heart’ because ‘vaccinating’ the entire global population iswhat the ‘Covid’ hoax set out to achieve. Official ‘decolonisation’ ofAfrica by the Cult was merely a prelude to financial colonisation onthe road to a return to physical colonisation. The ‘vaccine’ is vital tothat and the sudden and convenient death of the ‘Covid’ scepticpresident of Tanzania can be seen in its true light. A lot of people inAfrica are aware that this is another form of colonisation andexploitation and they need to stand their ground.The ‘vaccine is working’ scamA potential problem for the Cult was that the ‘vaccine’ is meant tochange human DNA and body messaging and not to protect anyonefrom a ‘virus’ never shown to exist. The vaccine couldn’t workbecause it was not designed to work and how could they make itappear to be working so that more people would have it? This wasovercome by lowering the amplification rate of the PCR test toproduce fewer ‘cases’ and therefore fewer ‘deaths’. Some of us hadbeen pointing out since March, 2020, that the amplification rate ofthe test not testing for the ‘virus’ had been made artificially high togenerate positive tests which they could call ‘cases’ to justifylockdowns.

He said the currentcycle was much too high and was ‘resulting in any particle beingdeclared a positive case’. Even one mainstream news report I sawsaid this meant the number of ‘Covid’ infections may have been‘dramatically inflated’. Oh, just a li\u0000le bit. The CDC in Americaissued new guidance to laboratories in April, 2021, to use 28 cyclesbut only for ‘vaccinated’ people. The timing of the CDC/WHOinterventions were cynically designed to make it appear the‘vaccines’ were responsible for falling cases and deaths when the realreason can be seen in the following examples. New York’s state lab,the Wadsworth Center, identified 872 positive tests in July, 2020,based on a threshold of 40 cycles. When the figure was lowered to 35cycles 43 percent of the 872 were no longer ‘positives’. At 30 cyclesthe figure was 63 percent. A Massachuse\u0000s lab found that between85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cyclethreshold of 40 would be negative at 30 cycles, Ashish Jha, MD,director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said: ‘I’m reallyshocked that it could be that high ... Boy, does it really change theway we need to be thinking about testing.’ I’m shocked that I couldsee the obvious in the spring of 2020, with no medical background,and most medical professionals still haven’t worked it out.

Thetruth was the exact opposite with deaths in care homes soaring withthe ‘vaccine’ and in Israel the term used was ‘skyrocket’. A re-analysis of published data from the Israeli Health Ministry led by DrHervé Seligmann at the Medicine Emerging Infectious and TropicalDiseases at Aix-Marseille University found that Pfizer’s ‘Covidvaccine’ killed ‘about 40 times more [elderly] people than the diseaseitself would have killed’ during a five-week vaccination period and260 times more younger people than would have died from the‘virus’ even according to the manipulated ‘virus’ figures.

It’s a well-honed Cult technique.What can the ‘vaccine’ really do?We have a ‘virus’ never shown to exist and ‘variants’ of the ‘virus’that have also never been shown to exist except, like the ‘original’, ascomputer-generated fictions. Even if you believe there’s a ‘virus’ the‘case’ to ‘death’ rate is in the region of 0.23 to 0.15 percent and those‘deaths’ are concentrated among the very old around the sameaverage age that people die anyway. In response to this lack of threat(in truth none) psychopaths and idiots, knowingly and unknowinglyanswering to Gates and the Cult, are seeking to ‘vaccinate’ everyman, woman and child on Planet Earth. Clearly the ‘vaccine’ is notabout ‘Covid’ – none of this ever has been. So what is it all aboutreally? Why the desperation to infuse genetically-manipulatingsynthetic material into everyone through mRNA fraudulent‘vaccines’ with the intent of doing this over and over with theexcuses of ‘variants’ and other ‘virus’ inventions? Dr SherriTenpenny, an osteopathic medical doctor in the United States, hasmade herself an expert on vaccines and their effects as a vehementcampaigner against their use. Tenpenny was board certified inemergency medicine, the director of a level two trauma centre for 12years, and moved to Cleveland in 1996 to start an integrative"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"medicine practice which has treated patients from all 50 states andsome 17 other countries. Weaning people off pharmaceutical drugs isa speciality.She became interested in the consequences of vaccines a\u0000era\u0000ending a meeting at the National Vaccine Information Center inWashington DC in 2000 where she ‘sat through four days of listeningto medical doctors and scientists and lawyers and parents of vaccineinjured kids’ and asked: ‘What’s going on?’ She had never beenvaccinated and never got ill while her father was given a list ofvaccines to be in the military and was ‘sick his entire life’. Theexperience added to her questions and she began to examine vaccinedocuments from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). A\u0000erreading the first one, the 1998 version of The General Recommendationsof Vaccination, she thought: ‘This is it?’ The document was poorlywri\u0000en and bad science and Tenpenny began 20 years of researchinto vaccines that continues to this day. She began her research into‘Covid vaccines’ in March, 2020, and she describes them as ‘deadly’.For many, as we have seen, they already have been. Tenpenny saidthat in the first 30 days of the ‘vaccine’ rollout in the United Statesthere had been more than 40,000 adverse events reported to thevaccine adverse event database. A document had been delivered toher the day before that was 172 pages long. ‘We have over 40,000adverse events; we have over 3,100 cases of [potentially deadly]anaphylactic shock; we have over 5,000 neurological reactions.’Effects ranged from headaches to numbness, dizziness and vertigo,to losing feeling in hands or feet and paraesthesia which is whenlimbs ‘fall asleep’ and people have the sensation of insects crawlingunderneath their skin. All this happened in the first 30 days andremember that only about ten percent (or far less) of adverse reactionsand vaccine-related deaths are estimated to be officially reported.Tenpenny said:So can you think of one single product in any industry, any industry, for as long as productshave been made on the planet that within 30 days we have 40,000 people complaining ofside effects that not only is still on the market but ... we’ve got paid actors telling us how great"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"they are for getting their vaccine.

Tenpenny described the ‘vaccine’ as ‘a well-designed killingtool’.No off-switchBad as the initial consequences had been Tenpenny said it would bemaybe 14 months before we began to see the ‘full ravage’ of what isgoing to happen to the ‘Covid vaccinated’ with full-outconsequences taking anything between two years and 20 years toshow. You can understand why when you consider that variations ofthe ‘Covid vaccine’ use mRNA (messenger RNA) to in theoryactivate the immune system to produce protective antibodieswithout using the actual ‘virus’. How can they when it’s a computerprogram and they’ve never isolated what they claim is the ‘realthing’? Instead they use synthetic mRNA. They are inoculatingsynthetic material into the body which through a technique knownas the Trojan horse is absorbed into cells to change the nature ofDNA. Human DNA is changed by an infusion of messenger RNAand with each new ‘vaccine’ of this type it is changed even more. Sayso and you are banned by Cult Internet platforms. The contempt thecontemptuous Mark Zuckerberg has for the truth and human healthcan be seen in an internal Facebook video leaked to the ProjectVeritas investigative team in which he said of the ‘Covid vaccines’:‘... I share some caution on this because we just don’t know the longterm side-effects of basically modifying people’s DNA and RNA.’ Atthe same time this disgusting man’s Facebook was censoring andbanning anyone saying exactly the same. He must go before aNuremberg trial for crimes against humanity when he knows that he"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"is censoring legitimate concerns and denying the right of informedconsent on behalf of the Cult that owns him. People have been killedand damaged by the very ‘vaccination’ technique he cast doubt onhimself when they may not have had the ‘vaccine’ with access toinformation that he denied them. The plan is to have at least annual‘Covid vaccinations’, add others to deal with invented ‘variants’, andchange all other vaccines into the mRNA system. Pfizer executivestold shareholders at a virtual Barclays Global Healthcare Conferencein March, 2021, that the public may need a third dose of ‘Covidvaccine’, plus regular yearly boosters and the company planned tohike prices to milk the profits in a ‘significant opportunity for ourvaccine’. These are the professional liars, cheats and opportunistswho are telling you their ‘vaccine’ is safe. Given this volume ofmRNA planned to be infused into the human body and its ability tothen replicate we will have a transformation of human genetics frombiological to synthetic biological – exactly the long-time Cult plan forreasons we’ll see – and many will die. Sherri Tenpenny said of thisreplication:It’s like having an on-button but no off-button and that whole mechanism ... they actuallygive it a name and they call it the Trojan horse mechanism, because it allows that [synthetic]virus and that piece of that [synthetic] virus to get inside of your cells, start to replicate andeven get inserted into other parts of your DNA as a Trojan-horse.Ask the overwhelming majority of people who have the ‘vaccine’what they know about the contents and what they do and theywould reply: ‘The government says it will stop me ge\u0000ing the virus.’Governments give that false impression on purpose to increase take-up. You can read Sherri Tenpenny’s detailed analysis of the healthconsequences in her blog at Vaxxter.com, but in summary these aresome of them. She highlights the statement by Bill Gates about howhuman beings can become their own ‘vaccine manufacturingmachine’. The man is insane. [‘Vaccine’-generated] ‘antibodies’ carrysynthetic messenger RNA into the cells and the damage starts,Tenpenny contends, and she says that lungs can be adverselyaffected through varying degrees of pus and bleeding which"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"obviously affects breathing and would be dubbed ‘Covid-19’. Evenmore sinister was the impact of ‘antibodies’ on macrophages, a whiteblood cell of the immune system. They consist of Type 1 and Type 2which have very different functions. She said Type 1 are ‘hyper-vigilant’ white blood cells which ‘gobble up’ bacteria etc. However,in doing so, this could cause inflammation and in extremecircumstances be fatal. She says these affects are mitigated by Type 2macrophages which kick in to calm down the system and stop itgoing rogue. They clear up dead tissue debris and reduceinflammation that the Type 1 ‘fire crews’ have caused. Type 1 killsthe infection and Type 2 heals the damage, she says. This is herpunchline with regard to ‘Covid vaccinations’: She says that mRNA‘antibodies’ block Type 2 macrophages by a\u0000aching to them anddeactivating them. This meant that when the Type 1 response wastriggered by infection there was nothing to stop that ge\u0000ing out ofhand by calming everything down. There’s an on-switch, but no off-switch, she says. What follows can be ‘over and out, see you when Isee you’.Genetic suicideTenpenny also highlights the potential for autoimmune disease – thebody a\u0000acking itself – which has been associated with vaccines sincethey first appeared. Infusing a synthetic foreign substance into cellscould cause the immune system to react in a panic believing that thebody is being overwhelmed by an invader (it is) and theconsequences can again be fatal. There is an autoimmune responseknown as a ‘cytokine storm’ which I have likened to a homeownerpanicked by an intruder and picking up a gun to shoot randomly inall directions before turning the fire on himself. The immune systemunleashes a storm of inflammatory response called cytokines to athreat and the body commits hara-kiri. The lesson is that you messwith the body’s immune response at your peril and these ‘vaccines’seriously – fundamentally – mess with immune response. Tenpennyrefers to a consequence called anaphylactic shock which is a severeand highly dangerous allergic reaction when the immune system"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"floods the body with chemicals. She gives the example of having abee sting which primes the immune system and makes it sensitive tothose chemicals. When people are stung again maybe years later theimmune response can be so powerful that it leads to anaphylacticshock. Tenpenny relates this ‘shock’ with regard to the ‘Covidvaccine’ to something called polyethylene glycol or PEG. Enormousnumbers of people have become sensitive to this over decades of usein a whole range of products and processes including food, drink,skin creams and ‘medicine’. Studies have claimed that some 72percent of people have antibodies triggered by PEG compared withtwo percent in the 1960s and allergic hypersensitive reactions to thisbecome a gathering cause for concern. Tenpenny points out that the‘mRNA vaccine’ is coated in a ‘bubble’ of polyethylene glycol whichhas the potential to cause anaphylactic shock through immunesensitivity. Many reports have appeared of people reacting this waya\u0000er having the ‘Covid vaccine’. What do we think is going tohappen as humanity has more and more of these ‘vaccines’?Tenpenny said: ‘All these pictures we have seen with people withthese rashes ... these weepy rashes, big reactions on their arms andthings like that – it’s an acute allergic reaction most likely to thepolyethylene glycol that you’ve been previously primed andsensitised to.’Those who have not studied the conspiracy and its perpetrators atlength might think that making the population sensitive to PEG andthen pu\u0000ing it in these ‘vaccines’ is just a coincidence. It is not. It isinstead testament to how carefully and coldly-planned currentevents have been and the scale of the conspiracy we are dealingwith. Tenpenny further explains that the ‘vaccine’ mRNA procedurecan breach the blood-brain barrier which protects the brain fromtoxins and other crap that will cause malfunction. In this case theycould make two proteins corrupt brain function to causeAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive nervous systemdisease leading to loss of muscle control, and frontal lobedegeneration – Alzheimer’s and dementia.

BartClasson published a paper connecting mRNA ‘vaccines’ to prion"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"disease which can lead to Alzheimer’s and other forms ofneurogenerative disease while others have pointed out the potentialto affect the placenta in ways that make women infertile. This willbecome highly significant in the next chapter when I will discussother aspects of this non-vaccine that relate to its nanotechnologyand transmission from the injected to the uninjected.Qualified in idiocyTenpenny describes how research has confirmed that these ‘vaccine’-generated antibodies can interact with a range of other tissues in thebody and a\u0000ack many other organs including the lungs. ‘This meansthat if you have a hundred people standing in front of you that allgot this shot they could have a hundred different symptoms.’Anyone really think that Cult gofers like the Queen, Tony Blair,Christopher Whi\u0000y, Anthony Fauci, and all the other psychopathshave really had this ‘vaccine’ in the pictures we’ve seen? Not abloody chance. Why don’t doctors all tell us about all these dangersand consequences of the ‘Covid vaccine’? Why instead do theyencourage and pressure patients to have the shot? Don’t let’s thinkfor a moment that doctors and medical staff can’t be stupid, lazy, andpsychopathic and that’s without the financial incentives to give thejab. Tenpenny again:Some people are going to die from the vaccine directly but a large number of people aregoing to start to get horribly sick and get all kinds of autoimmune diseases 42 days to maybe ayear out. What are they going to do, these stupid doctors who say; ‘Good for you for gettingthat vaccine.’ What are they going to say; ‘Oh, it must be a mutant, we need to give an extradose of that vaccine.’Because now the vaccine, instead of one dose or two doses we need three or four because thestupid physicians aren’t taking the time to learn anything about it. If I can learn this sitting inmy living room reading a 19 page paper and several others so can they. There’s nothingspecial about me, I just take the time to do it.Remember how Sara Kayat, the NHS and TV doctor, said that the‘Covid vaccine’ would ‘100 percent prevent hospitalisation anddeath’. Doctors can be idiots like every other profession and they"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"should not be worshipped as infallible.

If you do that you are an ‘expert’ and if you won’t you arean ‘anti-vaxxer’ and ‘Covidiot’. The pressure to be ‘vaccinated’ isincessant. We have even had reports claiming that the ‘vaccine’ canhelp cure cancer and Alzheimer’s and make the lame walk.

Such offers and incentives confirm the desperation.Perhaps the worse vaccine-stunt of them all was UK ‘Health’Secretary Ma\u0000-the-prat Hancock on live TV a\u0000er watching a clip ofsomeone being ‘vaccinated’ when the roll-out began. Hancock fakedtears so badly it was embarrassing. Brain-of-Britain Piers Morgan,the lockdown-supporting, ‘vaccine’ supporting, ‘vaccine’ passport-supporting, TV host played along with Hancock – ‘You’re quiteemotional about that’ he said in response to acting so atrocious itwould have been called out at a school nativity which willpresumably today include Mary and Jesus in masks, wise menkeeping their camels six feet apart, and shepherds under tent arrest.System-serving Morgan tweeted this: ‘Love the idea of covid vaccinepassports for everywhere: flights, restaurants, clubs, football, gyms,"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"shops etc. It’s time covid-denying, anti-vaxxer loonies had theirbullsh*t bluff called & bar themselves from going anywhere thatresponsible citizens go.’ If only I could aspire to his genius.

Gates has been funding a project to spray millionsof tonnes of chalk (calcium carbonate) into the stratosphere overSweden to ‘dim the Sun’ and cool the Earth. Scientists warned themove could be disastrous for weather systems in ways no one canpredict and opposition led to the Swedish space agency announcingthat the ‘experiment’ would not be happening as planned in thesummer of 2021; but it shows where the Cult is going with dimmingthe impact of the Sun and there’s an associated plan to change theplanet’s atmosphere.

Thedelivery system to block sunlight is widely referred to as chemtrailsalthough these have a much deeper agenda, too. They appear at firstto be contrails or condensation trails streaming from aircra\u0000 intocold air at high altitudes. Contrails disperse very quickly whilechemtrails do not and spread out across the sky before eventuallytheir content falls to earth. Many times I have watched aircra\u0000 cross-cross a clear blue sky releasing chemtrails until it looks like a cloudyday. Chemtrails contain many things harmful to humans and thenatural world including toxic heavy metals, aluminium (seeAlzheimer’s) and nanotechnology. Ray Kurzweil reveals the reasonwithout actually saying so: ‘Nanobots will infuse all the ma\u0000eraround us with information. Rocks, trees, everything will becomethese intelligent creatures.’ How do you deliver that? From the sky.Self-replicating nanobots would connect everything to the SmartGrid. The phenomenon of Morgellons disease began in the chemtrailera and the correlation has led to it being dubbed the ‘chemtraildisease’. Self-replicating fibres appear in the body that can be pulledout through the skin. Morgellons fibres continue to grow outside thebody and have a form of artificial intelligence.

What does that do to the human?Just imagine getting this substance in you and it can react to things all around you, the 5G,your smart device, your phones, what is happening with that? What if something is triggeringit, too, like an impulse, a frequency? We have something completely foreign in the humanbody.Madej said her research revealed that electromagnetic (EMF)frequencies emi\u0000ed by phones and other devices had increaseddramatically in the same period of the ‘vaccine’ rollout and she wasseeing more people with radiation problems as 5G and otherelectromagnetic technology was expanded and introduced to schoolsand hospitals. She said she was ‘floored with the EMF coming off’the devices she checked. All this makes total sense and syncs withmy own work of decades when you think that Moderna refers indocuments to its mRNA ‘vaccine’ as an ‘operating system’:Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technologyplatform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed sothat it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the ‘program’or ‘app’ is our mRNA drug – the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein ...... Our MRNA Medicines – ‘The ‘Software Of Life’: When we have a concept for a newmRNA medicine and begin research, fundamental components are already in place.Generally, the only thing that changes from one potential mRNA medicine to another is thecoding region – the actual genetic code that instructs ribosomes to make protein.

What ismissed with the ‘vaccines’ is the digital connection between syntheticmaterial and the body that I highlighted earlier with the study thathacked a computer with human DNA. On one level the body isdigital, based on mathematical codes, and I’ll have more about thatin the next chapter. Those who ridiculously claim that mRNA‘vaccines’ are not designed to change human genetics should explainthe words of Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical officer at Moderna, in a 2017TED talk. He said that over the last 30 years ‘we’ve been living thisphenomenal digital scientific revolution, and I’m here today to tellyou, that we are actually hacking the software of life, and that it’schanging the way we think about prevention and treatment ofdisease’:In every cell there’s this thing called messenger RNA, or mRNA for short, that transmits thecritical information from the DNA in our genes to the protein, which is really the stuff we’reall made out of. This is the critical information that determines what the cell will do. So wethink about it as an operating system. So if you could change that, if you could introduce aline of code, or change a line of code, it turns out, that has profound implications foreverything, from the flu to cancer.Zaks should more accurately have said that this has profoundimplications for the human genetic code and the nature of DNA.Communications within the body go both ways and not only one.But, hey, no, the ‘Covid vaccine’ will not affect your genetics. Cultfact-checkers say so even though the man who helped to develop themRNA technique says that it does. Zaks said in 2017:If you think about what it is we’re trying to do. We’ve taken information and ourunderstanding of that information and how that information is transmitted in a cell, and we’vetaken our understanding of medicine and how to make drugs, and we’re fusing the two.

Technology to do this has been readyand waiting in the underground bases and other secret projects to berolled out when the ‘Covid’ hoax was played. ‘Trials’ of such shortand irrelevant duration were only for public consumption. Whenthey say the ‘vaccine’ is ‘experimental’ that is not true. It may appearto be ‘experimental’ to those who don’t know what’s going on, butthe trials have already been done to ensure the Cult gets the result itdesires. Zaks said that it took decades to sequence the humangenome, completed in 2003, but now they could do it in a week. By‘they’ he means scientists operating in the public domain. In thesecret projects they were sequencing the genome in a week longbefore even 2003.Deluge of mRNAHighly significantly the Moderna document says the guidingpremise is that if using mRNA as a medicine works for one diseasethen it should work for many diseases. They were leveraging theflexibility afforded by their platform and the fundamental rolemRNA plays in protein synthesis to pursue mRNA medicines for abroad spectrum of diseases.

Synthetic biology is defined in these ways:A multidisciplinary area of research that seeks to create newbiological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign systems thatare already found in nature.The use of a mixture of physical engineering and geneticengineering to create new (and therefore synthetic) life forms.An emerging field of research that aims to combine theknowledge and methods of biology, engineering and relateddisciplines in the design of chemically-synthesized DNA to createorganisms with novel or enhanced characteristics and traits(synthetic organisms including humans).We now have synthetic blood, skin, organs and limbs beingdeveloped along with synthetic body parts produced by 3D printers.These are all elements of the synthetic human programme and thiscomment by Kurzweil’s co-founder of the Singularity University,"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Peter Diamandis, can be seen in a whole new light with the ‘Covid’hoax and the sanctions against those that refuse the ‘vaccine’:Anybody who is going to be resisting the progress forward [to transhumanism] is going to beresisting evolution and, fundamentally, they will die out.

The term ‘trans’ is so‘in’ and this is the dictionary definition:A prefix meaning ‘across’, ’through’, occurring ... in loanwords from Latin, used in particularfor denoting movement or conveyance from place to place (transfer; transmit; transplant) orcomplete change (transform; transmute), or to form adjectives meaning ’crossing’, ‘on theother side of’, or ‘going beyond’ the place named (transmontane; transnational; trans-Siberian).Transgender means to go beyond gender and transhuman meansto go beyond human. Both are aspects of the Cult plan to transformthe human body to a synthetic state with no gender. Human 2.0 is notdesigned to procreate and would be produced technologically withno need for parents. The new human would mean the end of parentsand so men, and increasingly women, are being targeted for thedeletion of their rights and status. Parental rights are disappearing atan ever-quickening speed for the same reason. The new humanwould have no need for men or women when there is no procreationand no gender. Perhaps the transgender movement that appears tobe in a permanent state of frenzy might now contemplate on how itis being used. This was never about transgender rights which areonly the interim excuse for confusing gender, particularly in theyoung, on the road to fusing gender.

From birth, people are genetically designed tofit into one of five castes, which are further split into ‘Plus’ and ‘Minus’ members and designedto fulfil predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the World State.How could Huxley know this in 1932? For the same reason GeorgeOrwell knew about the Big Brother state in 1948, Cult insiders I havequoted knew about it in 1969, and I have known about it since theearly 1990s.

The incubator creates all the rightconditions for its development, Hanna said. The liquid gives theembryo ‘all the nutrients, hormones and sugars they need’ alongwith a custom-made electronic incubator which controls gasconcentration, pressure and temperature.

I canidentify as a mountain climber, but it doesn’t mean I can climb amountain any more than a biological man can be a biologicalwoman. To believe so is a triumph of belief over factual reality whichis the very perceptual basis of everything Woke. Women’s sport isbeing destroyed by allowing those with male bodies who say theyidentify as female to ‘compete’ with girls and women. Male body‘women’ dominate ‘women’s’ competition with their greater musclemass, bone density, strength and speed. With that disadvantagesport for women loses all meaning. To put this in perspective nearly300 American high school boys can run faster than the quickestwoman sprinter in the world. Women are seeing their previouslyprotected spaces invaded by male bodies simply because they claimto identify as women. That’s all they need to do to access all women’sspaces and activities under the Biden ‘Equality Act’ that destroysequality for women with the usual Orwellian Woke inversion.

Exactly. I said during the long ago-started war on men(in which many women play a crucial part) that this was going toturn into a war on them. The Cult is phasing out both male andfemale genders. To get away with that they are brought into conflictso they are busy fighting each other while the Cult completes the jobwith no unity of response. Unity, people, unity. We need unityeverywhere. Transgender is the only show in town as the big steptowards the no-gender human. It’s not about rights for transgenderpeople and never has been. Woke political correctness is deletingwords relating to genders to the same end. Wokers believe this is tobe ‘inclusive’ when the opposite is true. They are deleting wordsdescribing gender because gender itself is being deleted by Human2.0. Terms like ‘man’, ‘woman’, ‘mother’ and ‘father’ are beingdeleted in the universities and other institutions to be replaced bythe no-gender, not trans-gender, ‘individuals’ and ‘guardians’.Women’s rights campaigner Maria Keffler of Partners for EthicalCare said: ‘Children are being taught from kindergarten upward thatsome boys have a vagina, some girls have a penis, and that kids canbe any gender they want to be.’ Do we really believe that suddenlycountries all over the world at the same time had the idea of havingdrag queens go into schools or read transgender stories to veryyoung children in the local library?

Women areexperiencing declining egg quality, more miscarriages, and morecouples suffer from infertility. Other findings were an increase inerectile dysfunction, infant boys developing more genitalabnormalities, male problems with conception, and plunging levelsof the male hormone testosterone which would explain why somany men have lost their backbone and masculinity.

The result wouldbe infertility ‘of indefinite duration’ in women who have the‘vaccine’ with the placenta failing to form. Section 10.4.2 of thePfizer/BioNTech trial protocol says that pregnant women or thosewho might become so should not have mRNA shots. Section 10.4warns men taking mRNA shots to ‘be abstinent from heterosexualintercourse’ and not to donate sperm. The UK government said thatit did not know if the mRNA procedure had an effect on fertility. Didnot know? These people have to go to jail.

The story, however, goes much deeper than that.The ‘Covid’ hoax is major part of the Cult agenda, but only part,and to grasp the biggest picture we have to expand our a\u0000entionbeyond the realm of human sight and into the infinity of possibilitythat we cannot see. It is from here, ultimately, that humanity is beingmanipulated into a state of total control by the force which dictatesthe actions of the Cult. How much of reality can we see? Next todamn all is the answer. We may appear to see all there is to see in the‘space’ our eyes survey and observe, but li\u0000le could be further fromthe truth. The human ‘world’ is only a tiny band of frequency thatthe body’s visual and perceptual systems can decode into perceptionof a ‘world’. According to mainstream science the electromagneticspectrum is 0.005 percent of what exists in the Universe (Fig 10). Themaximum estimate I have seen is 0.5 percent and either way it’sminiscule. I say it is far, far, smaller even than 0.005 percent whenyou compare reality we see with the totality of reality that we don’t.Now get this if you are new to such information: Visible light, theonly band of frequency that we can see, is a fraction of the 0.005"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"percent (Fig 11 overleaf). Take this further and realise that ouruniverse is one of infinite universes and that universes are only afragment of overall reality – infinite reality. Then compare that withthe almost infinitesimal frequency band of visible light or humansight. You see that humans are as near blind as it is possible to bewithout actually being so. Artist and filmmaker, Sergio Toporek,said:Figure 10: Humans can perceive such a tiny band of visual reality it’s laughable.Figure 11: We can see a smear of the 0.005 percent electromagnetic spectrum, but we stillknow it all. Yep, makes sense.Consider that you can see less than 1% of the electromagnetic spectrum and hear less than1% of the acoustic spectrum. 90% of the cells in your body carry their own microbial DNAand are not ‘you’.

Takeinto account, too, that Planet Earth when compared with theprojected size of this single universe is the equivalent of a billionth ofa pinhead. Imagine the ratio that would be when compared toinfinite reality. To think that Christianity once insisted that Earth andhumanity were the centre of everything. This background is vital ifwe are going to appreciate the nature of ‘human’ and how we can bemanipulated by an unseen force. To human visual reality virtuallyeverything is unseen and yet the prevailing perception within theinstitutions and so much of the public is that if we can’t see it, touchit, hear it, taste it and smell it then it cannot exist. Such perception isindoctrinated and encouraged by the Cult and its agents because itisolates believers in the strictly limited, village-idiot, realm of the fivesenses where perceptions can be firewalled and informationcontrolled. Most of those perpetuating the ‘this-world-is-all-there-is’insanity are themselves indoctrinated into believing the samedelusion.

Consciousness does not come from the brain, but throughthe brain and even that is more symbolic than literal.

Labels of ahuman life, man, woman, transgender, black, white, brown,nationality, circumstances and income are not who we are. They arewhat we are – awareness – is experiencing in a brief connection with aband of frequency we call ‘human’. The labels are not the self; theyare, to use the title of one of my books, a Phantom Self. I am notDavid Icke born in Leicester, England, on April 29th, 1952. I am theconsciousness having that experience. The Cult and its non-humanmasters seek to convince us through the institutions of ‘education’,science, medicine, media and government that what we areexperiencing is who we are. It’s so easy to control and directperception locked away in the bewildered illusions of the five senseswith no expanded radar. Try, by contrast, doing the same with ahumanity aware of its true self and its true power to consciouslycreate its reality and experience. How is it possible to do this? We doit all day every day. If you perceive yourself as ‘li\u0000le me’ with nopower to impact upon your life and the world then your lifeexperience will reflect that. You will hand the power you don’t thinkyou have to authority in all its forms which will use it to control yourexperience. This, in turn, will appear to confirm your perception of‘li\u0000le me’ in a self-fulfilling feedback loop. But that is what ‘li\u0000le me’really is – a perception. We are all ‘big-me’, infinite me, and the Culthas to make us forget that if its will is to prevail. We are thereforemanipulated and pressured into self-identifying with human labelsand not the consciousness/awareness experiencing those humanlabels.The phenomenon of identity politics is a Cult-instigatedmanipulation technique to sub-divide previous labels into evensmaller ones.

Wokersprogrammed by the Cult for generations believe this is about‘inclusivity’ when it’s really the Cult locking them away into smallerand smaller versions of Phantom Self while firewalling them fromthe influence of their true self, the infinite, eternal ‘I’. You may noticethat my philosophy which contends that we are all unique points ofa\u0000ention/awareness within the same infinite whole or Oneness is theultimate non-racism. The very sense of Oneness makes thejudgement of people by their body-type, colour or sexuality u\u0000erlyridiculous and confirms that racism has no understanding of reality(including anti-white racism). Yet despite my perception of life Cultagents and fast-asleep Wokers label me racist to discredit myinformation while they are themselves phenomenally racist andsexist. All they see is race and sexuality and they judge people asgood or bad, demons or untouchables, by their race and sexuality.All they see is Phantom Self and perceive themselves in terms ofPhantom Self. They are pawns and puppets of the Cult agenda tofocus a\u0000ention and self-identity in the five senses and play thoseidentities against each other to divide and rule. Columbia Universityhas introduced segregated graduations in another version of socialdistancing designed to drive people apart and teach them thatdifferent racial and cultural groups have nothing in common witheach other. The last thing the Cult wants is unity. Again the pump-primers of this will be Cult operatives in the knowledge of what theyare doing, but the rest are just the Phantom Self blind leading thePhantom Self blind. We do have something in common – we are allthe same consciousness having different temporary experiences.What is this ‘human’?"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"Yes, what is ‘human’? That is what we are supposed to be, right? Imean ‘human’? True, but ‘human’ is the experience not the ‘I’. Breakit down to basics and ‘human’ is the way that information isprocessed. If we are to experience and interact with this band offrequency we call the ‘world’ we must have a vehicle that operateswithin that band of frequency. Our consciousness in its prime formcannot do that; it is way beyond the frequency of the human realm.My consciousness or awareness could not tap these keys and pick upthe cup in front of me in the same way that radio station A cannotinteract with radio station B when they are on different frequencies.The human body is the means through which we have thatinteraction. I have long described the body as a biological computerwhich processes information in a way that allows consciousness toexperience this reality. The body is a receiver, transmi\u0000er andprocessor of information in a particular way that we call human. Wevisually perceive only the world of the five senses in a wakened state– that is the limit of the body’s visual decoding system. In truth it’snot even visual in the way we experience ‘visual reality’ as I willcome to in a moment. We are ‘human’ because the body processesthe information sources of human into a reality and behavioursystem that we perceive as human. Why does an elephant act like anelephant and not like a human or a duck? The elephant’s biologicalcomputer is a different information field and processes informationaccording to that program into a visual and behaviour type we callan elephant. The same applies to everything in our reality. Thesebody information fields are perpetuated through procreation (likemaking a copy of a so\u0000ware program). The Cult wants to break thatcycle and intervene technologically to transform the humaninformation field into one that will change what we call humanity. Ifit can change the human information field it will change the waythat field processes information and change humanity both‘physically’ and psychologically. Hence the messenger (information)RNA ‘vaccines’ and so much more that is targeting human geneticsby changing the body’s information – messaging – construct throughfood, drink, radiation, toxicity and other means."},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Reality that we experience is nothing like reality as it really is inthe same way that the reality people experience in virtual realitygames is not the reality they are really living in. The game is only adecoded source of information that appears to be a reality. Ourworld is also an information construct – a simulation (more later). Inits base form our reality is a wavefield of information much the samein theme as Wi-Fi. The five senses decode wavefield information intoelectrical information which they communicate to the brain todecode into holographic (illusory ‘physical’) information. Differentparts of the brain specialise in decoding different senses and theinformation is fused into a reality that appears to be outside of usbut is really inside the brain and the genetic structure in general (Fig12 overleaf). DNA is a receiver-transmi\u0000er of information and a vitalpart of this decoding process and the body’s connection to otherrealities. Change DNA and you change the way we decode andconnect with reality – see ‘Covid vaccines’. Think of computersdecoding Wi-Fi. You have information encoded in a radiation fieldand the computer decodes that information into a very differentform on the screen. You can’t see the Wi-Fi until its information ismade manifest on the screen and the information on the screen isinside the computer and not outside. I have just described how wedecode the ‘human world’. All five senses decode the waveform ‘Wi-Fi’ field into electrical signals and the brain (computer) constructsreality inside the brain and not outside – ‘You don’t just look at arainbow, you create it’. Sound is a simple example. We don’t hearsound until the brain decodes it. Waveform sound waves are pickedup by the hearing sense and communicated to the brain in anelectrical form to be decoded into the sounds that we hear.Everything we hear is inside the brain along with everything we see,feel, smell and taste. Words and language are waveform fieldsgenerated by our vocal chords which pass through this process untilthey are decoded by the brain into words that we hear. Differentlanguages are different frequency fields or sound waves generatedby vocal chords.

All these phenomena are interactions, or transactions, ofvibrations with a certain arrangement of neurons.That’s exactly what they are and scientist Robert Lanza describes inhis book, Biocentrism, how we decode electromagnetic waves andenergy into visual and ‘physical’ experience. He uses the example ofa flame emi\u0000ing photons, electromagnetic energy, each pulsingelectrically and magnetically:... these ... invisible electromagnetic waves strike a human retina, and if (and only if) thewaves happen to measure between 400 and 700 nano meters in length from crest to crest,then their energy is just right to deliver a stimulus to the 8 million cone-shaped cells in theretina.Each in turn send an electrical pulse to a neighbour neuron, and on up the line this goes, at250 mph, until it reaches the ... occipital lobe of the brain, in the back of the head. There, acascading complex of neurons fire from the incoming stimuli, and we subjectively perceivethis experience as a yellow brightness occurring in a place we have been conditioned to callthe ‘external world’.You hear what you decode"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"If a tree falls or a building collapses they make no noise unlesssomeone is there to decode the energetic waves generated by thedisturbance into what we call sound. Does a falling tree make anoise? Only if you hear it – decode it. Everything in our reality is afrequency field of information operating within the overall ‘Wi-Fi’field that I call The Field. A vibrational disturbance is generated inThe Field by the fields of the falling tree or building. Thesedisturbance waves are what we decode into the sound of themfalling. If no one is there to do that then neither will make any noise.Reality is created by the observer – decoder – and the perceptions ofthe observer affect the decoding process. For this reason differentpeople – different perceptions – will perceive the same reality orsituation in a different way. What one may perceive as a nightmareanother will see as an opportunity. The question of why the Cult isso focused on controlling human perception now answers itself. Allexperienced reality is the act of decoding and we don’t experienceWi-Fi until it is decoded on the computer screen. The sight andsound of an Internet video is encoded in the Wi-Fi all around us, butwe don’t see or hear it until the computer decodes that information.Taste, smell and touch are all phenomena of the brain as a result ofthe same process. We don’t taste, smell or feel anything except in thebrain and there are pain relief techniques that seek to block thesignal from the site of discomfort to the brain because if the braindoesn’t decode that signal we don’t feel pain. Pain is in the brain andonly appears to be at the point of impact thanks to the feedback loopbetween them. We don’t see anything until electrical informationfrom the sight senses is decoded in an area at the back of the brain. Ifthat area is damaged we can go blind when our eyes are perfectlyokay. So why do we go blind if we damage an eye? We damage theinformation processing between the waveform visual informationand the visual decoding area of the brain.

This explanation is from the science magazine,Wonderpedia:Every second, 11 million sensations crackle along these [brain] pathways ... The brain isconfronted with an alarming array of images, sounds and smells which it rigorously filtersdown until it is left with a manageable list of around 40. Thus 40 sensations per second makeup what we perceive as reality.The ‘world’ is not what people are told to believe that is it and theinner circles of the Cult know that.Illusory ‘physical’ realityWe can only see a smear of 0.005 percent of the Universe which isonly one of a vast array of universes – ‘mansions’ – within infinitereality. Even then the brain decodes only 40 pieces of information(‘sensations’) from a potential 11 million that we receive everysecond. Two points strike you from this immediately: The sheerbreathtaking stupidity of believing we know anything so rigidly thatthere’s nothing more to know; and the potential for these processesto be manipulated by a malevolent force to control the reality of thepopulation. One thing I can say for sure with no risk of contradictionis that when you can perceive an almost indescribable fraction ofinfinite reality there is always more to know as in tidal waves of it.Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was so right when he said thatwisdom is to know how li\u0000le we know.

Cult-controlled ‘science’ dismisses the so-called ‘paranormal’ and all phenomena related to that when the‘para’-normal is perfectly normal and explains the alleged ‘greatmysteries’ which dumbfound scientific minds. There is a reason forthis. A ‘scientific mind’ in terms of the mainstream is a materialmind, a five-sense mind imprisoned in see it, touch it, hear it, smell itand taste it.

We are now well aware ofholograms which are widely used today. Two-dimensionalinformation is decoded into a three-dimensional reality that is notsolid although can very much appear to be (Fig 13). Holograms arecreated with a laser divided into two parts. One goes directly onto aholographic photographic print (‘reference beam’) and the othertakes a waveform image of the subject (‘working beam’) before beingdirected onto the print where it ‘collides’ with the other half of thelaser (Fig 14). This creates a waveform interference pa\u0000ern whichcontains the wavefield information of whatever is beingphotographed (Fig 15 overleaf). The process can be likened todropping pebbles in a pond. Waves generated by each one spreadout across the water to collide with the others and create a waverepresentation of where the stones fell and at what speed, weightand distance.

We are meant to be in this world in terms of the fivesenses but not of this world in relation to our greater consciousnessand perspective. In that state we experience the small picture of thefive senses within the wider context of the big picture of awarenessbeyond the five senses. Put another way the five senses see the dotsand expanded awareness connects them into pictures and pa\u0000ernsthat give context to the apparently random and unconnected.Without the context of expanded awareness the five senses see onlyapartness and randomness with apparently no meaning. The Cultand its other-dimensional controllers seek to intervene in thefrequency realm where five-sense reality is supposed to connect withexpanded reality and to keep the two apart (more on this in the finalchapter). When that happens five-sense mental and emotionalprocesses are no longer influenced by expanded awareness, or theTrue ‘I’, and instead are driven by the isolated perceptions of thebody’s decoding systems. They are in the world and of it. Here wehave the human plight and why humanity with its potential forinfinite awareness can be so easily manipulatable and descend intosuch extremes of stupidity.Once the Cult isolates five-sense mind from expanded awarenessit can then program the mind with perceptions and beliefs bycontrolling information that the mind receives through the‘education’ system of the formative years and the media perceptualbombardment and censorship of an entire lifetime.

These are nomore than a ‘spiritual’ fairy tales to control and dictate events andbehaviour through fear of this ‘God’ which has bizarrely made ‘God-fearing’ in religious circles a state to be desired. I would suggest thatfearing anything is not to be encouraged and celebrated, but ratherdeleted. You can see why ‘God fearing’ is so beneficial to the Cultand its religions when they decide what ‘God’ wants and what ‘God’demands (the Cult demands) that everyone do. As the greatAmerican comedian Bill Hicks said satirising a Christian zealot: ‘Ithink what God meant to say.’ How much of this infinite awareness(‘God’) that we access is decided by how far we choose to expandour perceptions, self-identity and sense of the possible.

I tookit back to ancient Rome and Egypt and on to Babylon and Sumer inMesopotamia, the ‘Land Between Two Rivers’, in what we now callIraq. The two rivers are the Tigris and Euphrates and this region is ofimmense historical and other importance to the Cult, as is the landcalled Israel only 550 miles away by air. There is much more goingwith deep esoteric meaning across this whole region. It’s not onlyabout ‘wars for oil’. Priceless artefacts from Mesopotamia werestolen or destroyed a\u0000er the American and British invasion of Iraq in2003 justified by the lies of Boy Bush and Tony Blair (their Cultmasters) about non-existent ‘weapons of mass destruction’.Mesopotamia was the location of Sumer (about 5,400BC to 1,750BC),and Babylon (about 2,350BC to 539BC). Sabbatians may have becomeimmensely influential in the Cult in modern times but they are partof a network that goes back into the mists of history. Sumer is said byhistorians to be the ‘cradle of civilisation’. I disagree. I say it was there-start of what we call human civilisation a\u0000er cataclysmic eventssymbolised in part as the ‘Great Flood’ destroyed the world thatexisted before. These fantastic upheavals that I have been describingin detail in the books since the early1990s appear in accounts andlegends of ancient cultures across the world and they are supportedby geological and biological evidence. Stone tablets found in Iraqdetailing the Sumer period say the cataclysms were caused by non-human ‘gods’ they call the Anunnaki. These are described in termsof extraterrestrial visitations in which knowledge supplied by theAnunnaki is said to have been the source of at least one of theworld’s oldest writing systems and developments in astronomy,mathematics and architecture that were way ahead of their time. Ihave covered this subject at length in The Biggest Secret and Childrenof the Matrix and the same basic ‘Anunnaki’ story can be found inZulu accounts in South Africa where the late and very great Zuluhigh shaman Credo Mutwa told me that the Sumerian Anunnakiwere known by Zulus as the Chitauri or ‘children of the serpent’.

Spanish and Portuguese colonialists headed for Central andSouth America while the British and French targeted North America.Africa was colonised by Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands,Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Germany. Some like Britain and Francemoved in on the Middle East. The British Empire was by far thebiggest for a simple reason. By now Britain was the headquarters ofthe Cult from which it expanded to form Canada, the United States,Australia and New Zealand. The Sun never set on the British Empiresuch was the scale of its occupation.

The Cult in Europe hasmostly loaded the guns for the US to fire. America has beencontrolled from Europe from the start through Cult operatives inBritain and Europe.

They play a major role in the development andcirculation of vaccines through the Rockefeller Foundation on whichBill Gates said his Foundation is based. Why wouldn’t this be thecase when the Rockefellers and Gates are on the same team? Cultinfiltration of human society goes way back into what we call historyand has been constantly expanding and centralising power with thegoal of establishing a global structure to dictate everything. Lookhow this has been advanced in great leaps with the ‘Covid’ hoax.The non-human dimensionI researched and observed the comings and goings of Cult operativesthrough the centuries and even thousands of years as they wereborn, worked to promote the agenda within the secret society andsatanic networks, and then died for others to replace them. Clearlythere had to be a coordinating force that spanned this entire periodwhile operatives who would not have seen the end goal in theirlifetimes came and went advancing the plan over millennia. I wentin search of that coordinating force with the usual support from theextraordinary synchronicity of my life which has been an almostdaily experience since 1990. I saw common themes in religious textsand ancient cultures about a non-human force manipulating humansociety from the hidden. Christianity calls this force Satan, the Deviland demons; Islam refers to the Jinn or Djinn; Zulus have theirChitauri (spelt in other ways in different parts of Africa); and theGnostic people in Egypt in the period around and before 400ADreferred to this phenomena as the ‘Archons’, a word meaning rulersin Greek. Central American cultures speak of the ‘Predators’ amongother names and the same theme is everywhere. I will use ‘Archons’as a collective name for all of them. When you see how their natureand behaviour is described all these different sources are clearlytalking about the same force. Gnostics described the Archons interms of ‘luminous fire’ while Islam relates the Jinn to ‘smokelessfire’. Some refer to beings in form that could occasionally be seen,but the most common of common theme is that they operate from"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"unseen realms which means almost all existence to the visualprocesses of humans. I had concluded that this was indeed thefoundation of human control and that the Cult was operating withinthe human frequency band on behalf of this hidden force when Icame across the writings of Gnostics which supported myconclusions in the most extraordinary way.A sealed earthen jar was found in 1945 near the town of NagHammadi about 75-80 miles north of Luxor on the banks of the RiverNile in Egypt. Inside was a treasure trove of manuscripts and textsle\u0000 by the Gnostic people some 1,600 years earlier. They included 13leather-bound papyrus codices (manuscripts) and more than 50 textswri\u0000en in Coptic Egyptian estimated to have been hidden in the jarin the period of 400AD although the source of the information goesback much further. Gnostics oversaw the Great or Royal Library ofAlexandria, the fantastic depository of ancient texts detailingadvanced knowledge and accounts of human history. The Librarywas dismantled and destroyed in stages over a long period with thedeath-blow delivered by the Cult-established Roman Church in theperiod around 415AD. The Church of Rome was the Church ofBabylon relocated as I said earlier. Gnostics were not a race. Theywere a way of perceiving reality. Whenever they establishedthemselves and their information circulated the terrorists of theChurch of Rome would target them for destruction. This happenedwith the Great Library and with the Gnostic Cathars who wereburned to death by the psychopaths a\u0000er a long period ofoppression at the siege of the Castle of Monségur in southern Francein 1244. The Church has always been terrified of Gnostic informationwhich demolishes the official Christian narrative although there ismuch in the Bible that supports the Gnostic view if you read it inanother way. To anyone studying the texts of what became known asthe Nag Hammadi Library it is clear that great swathes of Christianand Biblical belief has its origin with Gnostics sources going back toSumer. Gnostic themes have been twisted to manipulate theperceived reality of Bible believers. Biblical texts have been in theopen for centuries where they could be changed while Gnostic"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"documents found at Nag Hammadi were sealed away anduntouched for 1,600 years. What you see is what they wrote.Use your pneuma not your nousGnosticism and Gnostic come from ‘gnosis’ which meansknowledge, or rather secret knowledge, in the sense of spiritualawareness – knowledge about reality and life itself. The desperationof the Cult’s Church of Rome to destroy the Gnostics can beunderstood when the knowledge they were circulating was the lastthing the Cult wanted the population to know. Sixteen hundredyears later the same Cult is working hard to undermine and silenceme for the same reason. The dynamic between knowledge andignorance is a constant. ‘Time’ appears to move on, but essentialthemes remain the same. We are told to ‘use your nous’, a Gnosticword for head/brain/intelligence. They said, however, that spiritualawakening or ‘salvation’ could only be secured by expandingawareness beyond what they called nous and into pneuma or InfiniteSelf. Obviously as I read these texts the parallels with what I havebeen saying since 1990 were fascinating to me. There is a universaltruth that spans human history and in that case why wouldn’t we betalking the same language 16 centuries apart? When you freeyourself from the perception program of the five senses and exploreexpanded realms of consciousness you are going to connect with thesame information no ma\u0000er what the perceived ‘era’ within amanufactured timeline of a single and tiny range of manipulatedfrequency. Humans working with ‘smart’ technology or knockingrocks together in caves is only a timeline appearing to operate withinthe human frequency band. Expanded awareness and theknowledge it holds have always been there whether the era be StoneAge or computer age. We can only access that knowledge byopening ourselves to its frequency which the five-sense prison cell isdesigned to stop us doing.

We need to go there fast.Archon hijackA fi\u0000h of the Nag Hammadi texts describe the existence andmanipulation of the Archons led by a ‘Chief Archon’ they call‘Yaldabaoth’, or the ‘Demiurge’, and this is the Christian ‘Devil’,‘Satan’, ‘Lucifer’, and his demons. Archons in Biblical symbolism arethe ‘fallen ones’ which are also referred to as fallen angels a\u0000er theangels expelled from heaven according to the Abrahamic religions ofJudaism, Christianity and Islam. These angels are claimed to tempthumans to ‘sin’ ongoing and you will see how accurate thatsymbolism is during the rest of the book. The theme of ‘original sin’is related to the ‘Fall’ when Adam and Eve were ‘tempted by theserpent’ and fell from a state of innocence and ‘obedience’(connection) with God into a state of disobedience (disconnection).The Fall is said to have brought sin into the world and corruptedeverything including human nature. Yaldabaoth, the ‘Lord Archon’,is described by Gnostics as a ‘counterfeit spirit’, ‘The Blind One’,‘The Blind God’, and ‘The Foolish One’. The Jewish name forYaldabaoth in Talmudic writings is Samael which translates as‘Poison of God’, or ‘Blindness of God’. You see the parallels.Yaldabaoth in Islamic belief is the Muslim Jinn devil known asShaytan – Shaytan is Satan as the same themes are found all over theworld in every religion and culture. The ‘Lord God’ of the OldTestament is the ‘Lord Archon’ of Gnostic manuscripts and that’swhy he’s such a bloodthirsty bastard. Satan is known by Christiansas ‘the Demon of Demons’ and Gnostics called Yaldabaoth the‘Archon of Archons’. Both are known as ‘The Deceiver’.

The ‘Covid’ hoax alone is a glaring example ofall these things. The Biblical ‘God’ is so different in the Old and NewTestaments because they are not describing the same phenomenon.The vindictive, angry, hate-filled, ‘God’ of the Old Testament, knownas Yahweh, is Yaldabaoth who is depicted in Cult-dictated popularculture as the ‘Dark Lord’, ‘Lord of Time’, Lord (Darth) Vader andDormammu, the evil ruler of the ‘Dark Dimension’ trying to takeover the ‘Earth Dimension’ in the Marvel comic movie, Dr Strange.Yaldabaoth is both the Old Testament ‘god’ and the Biblical ‘Satan’.Gnostics referred to Yaldabaoth as the ‘Great Architect of theUniverse’and the Cult-controlled Freemason network calls their god‘the ‘Great Architect of the Universe’ (also Grand Architect). The‘Great Architect’ Yaldabaoth is symbolised by the Cult as the all-seeing eye at the top of the pyramid on the Great Seal of the UnitedStates and the dollar bill. Archon is encoded in arch-itect as it is inarch-angels and arch-bishops. All religions have the theme of a forcefor good and force for evil in some sort of spiritual war and there is areason for that – the theme is true. The Cult and its non-humanmasters are quite happy for this to circulate. They presentthemselves as the force for good fighting evil when they are reallythe force of evil (absence of love). The whole foundation of Cultmodus operandi is inversion. They promote themselves as a force forgood and anyone challenging them in pursuit of peace, love,fairness, truth and justice is condemned as a satanic force for evil.This has been the game plan throughout history whether the Churchof Rome inquisitions of non-believers or ‘conspiracy theorists’ and‘anti-vaxxers’ of today. The technique is the same whatever thetimeline era.Yaldabaoth is revolting (true)"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Yaldabaoth and the Archons are said to have revolted against Godwith Yaldabaoth claiming to be God – the All That Is. The OldTestament ‘God’ (Yaldabaoth) demanded to be worshipped as such: ‘I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me’(Isaiah 45:5). I have quoted in other books a man who said he wasthe unofficial son of the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild of theMouton-Rothschild wine producing estates in France who died in1988 and he told me about the Rothschild ‘revolt from God’. Theman said he was given the name Phillip Eugene de Rothschild andwe shared long correspondence many years ago while he was livingunder another identity. He said that he was conceived through‘occult incest’ which (within the Cult) was ‘normal and to beadmired’. ‘Phillip’ told me about his experience a\u0000ending satanicrituals with rich and famous people whom he names and you cansee them and the wider background to Cult Satanism in my otherbooks starting with The Biggest Secret. Cult rituals are interactionswith Archontic ‘gods’. ‘Phillip’ described Baron Philippe deRothschild as ‘a master Satanist and hater of God’ and he used thesame term ‘revolt from God’ associated withYaldabaoth/Satan/Lucifer/the Devil in describing the SabbatianRothschild dynasty. ‘I played a key role in my family’s revolt fromGod’, he said. That role was to infiltrate in classic Sabbatian style theChristian Church, but eventually he escaped the mind-prison to liveanother life. The Cult has been targeting religion in a plan to makeworship of the Archons the global one-world religion. Infiltration ofSatanism into modern ‘culture’, especially among the young,through music videos, stage shows and other means, is all part ofthis.Nag Hammadi texts describe Yaldabaoth and the Archons in theirprime form as energy – consciousness – and say they can take form ifthey choose in the same way that consciousness takes form as ahuman. Yaldabaoth is called ‘formless’ and represents a deeplyinverted, distorted and chaotic state of consciousness which seeks toa\u0000ached to humans and turn them into a likeness of itself in ana\u0000empt at assimilation. For that to happen it has to manipulate"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"humans into low frequency mental and emotional states that matchits own. Archons can certainly appear in human form and this is theorigin of the psychopathic personality. The energetic distortionGnostics called Yaldabaoth is psychopathy. When psychopathicArchons take human form that human will be a psychopath as anexpression of Yaldabaoth consciousness. Cult psychopaths areArchons in human form. The principle is the same as that portrayedin the 2009 Avatar movie when the American military travelled to afictional Earth-like moon called Pandora in the Alpha Centauri starsystem to infiltrate a society of blue people, or Na’vi, by hidingwithin bodies that looked like the Na’vi. Archons posing as humanshave a particular hybrid information field, part human, part Archon,(the ancient ‘demigods’) which processes information in a way thatmanifests behaviour to match their psychopathic evil, lack ofempathy and compassion, and stops them being influenced by theempathy, compassion and love that a fully-human information fieldis capable of expressing. Cult bloodlines interbreed, be they royaltyor dark suits, for this reason and you have their obsession withincest. Interbreeding with full-blown humans would dilute theArchontic energy field that guarantees psychopathy in itsrepresentatives in the human realm.Gnostic writings say the main non-human forms that Archonstake are serpentine (what I have called for decades ‘reptilian’ amidunbounded ridicule from the Archontically-programmed) and whatGnostics describe as ‘an unborn baby or foetus with grey skin anddark, unmoving eyes’. This is an excellent representation of the ET‘Greys’ of UFO folklore which large numbers of people claim to haveseen and been abducted by – Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa amongthem.

The Renegade Mind, however,wants to know the source of everything and not only the way thatsource manifests as human or non-human. In the same way that aRenegade Mind seeks the original source material for the ‘Covidvirus’ to see if what is claimed is true. The original source ofArchons in form is consciousness – the distorted state ofconsciousness known to Gnostics as Yaldabaoth.‘Revolt from God’ is energetic disconnectionWhere I am going next will make a lot of sense of religious texts andancient legends relating to ‘Satan’, Lucifer’ and the ‘gods’. Gnosticdescriptions sync perfectly with the themes of my own research overthe years in how they describe a consciousness distortion seeking toimpose itself on human consciousness. I’ve referred to the core ofinfinite awareness in previous books as Infinite Awareness inAwareness of Itself. By that I mean a level of awareness that knowsthat it is all awareness and is aware of all awareness. From herecomes the frequency of love in its true sense and balance which iswhat love is on one level – the balance of all forces into a singlewhole called Oneness and Isness. The more we disconnect from thisstate of love that many call ‘God’ the constituent parts of thatOneness start to unravel and express themselves as a part and not awhole. They become individualised as intellect, mind, selfishness,hatred, envy, desire for power over others, and such like. This is nota problem in the greater scheme in that ‘God’, the All That Is, canexperience all these possibilities through different expressions ofitself including humans. What we as expressions of the wholeexperience the All That Is experiences. We are the All That Isexperiencing itself. As we withdraw from that state of Oneness wedisconnect from its influence and things can get very unpleasant andvery stupid. Archontic consciousness is at the extreme end of that. Ithas so disconnected from the influence of Oneness that it has becomean inversion of unity and love, an inversion of everything, aninversion of life itself.

As a result the Cult, Archonsincarnate, act with such evil, psychopathy and lack of empathy andcompassion disconnected as they are from the source of love.

We do live in atechnologically-generated virtual reality simulation (more veryshortly) and we have been manipulated to be an energy source forArchontic consciousness. The Disney-Pixar animated movieMonsters, Inc. in 2001 symbolised the dynamic when monsters intheir world had no energy source and they would enter the humanworld to terrify children in their beds, catch the child’s scream, terror(low-vibrational frequencies), and take that energy back to powerthe monster world. The lead character you might remember was asingle giant eye and the symbolism of the Cult’s all-seeing eye wasobvious. Every thought and emotion is broadcast as a frequencyunique to that thought and emotion. Feelings of love and joy,empathy and compassion, are high, quick, frequencies while fear,depression, anxiety, suffering and hate are low, slow, densefrequencies. Which kind do you think Archontic consciousness canconnect with and absorb? In such a low and dense frequency statethere’s no way it can connect with the energy of love and joy.Archons can only feed off energy compatible with their ownfrequency and they and their Cult agents want to delete the humanworld of love and joy and manipulate the transmission of lowvibrational frequencies through low-vibrational human mental andemotional states. We are their energy source. Wars are energeticbanquets to the Archons – a world war even more so – and thinkhow much low-frequency mental and emotional energy has beengenerated from the consequences for humanity of the ‘Covid’ hoaxorchestrated by Archons incarnate like Gates.The ancient practice of human sacrifice ‘to the gods’, continued insecret today by the Cult, is based on the same principle. ‘The gods’are Archontic consciousness in different forms and the sacrifice isinduced into a state of intense terror to generate the energy theArchontic frequency can absorb. Incarnate Archons in the ritualdrink the blood which contains an adrenaline they crave whichfloods into the bloodstream when people are terrorised.

It’s the usual Woke crap that inverts racism and calls it anti-racism. In this case solidarity with ‘indigenous tribes’ is being usedas an excuse to chant the names of ‘gods’ to which people weresacrificed (and still are in secret). What an example of Woke’sinability to see beyond black and white, us and them, They condemnthe colonisation of these tribal cultures by Europeans (quite right),but those cultures sacrificing people including children to their‘gods’, and mass murdering untold numbers as the Aztecs did, isjust fine.

Come onchildren ... a\u0000er three ... Other sacrificial ‘gods’ for the young tochant their allegiance include Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli and XipeTotec.

Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was theAustrian philosopher and famous esoteric thinker who establishedWaldorf education or Steiner schools to treat children like uniqueexpressions of consciousness and not minds to be programmed withthe perceptions determined by authority. I’d been writing about thisenergy vampiring for decades when I was sent in 2016 a quote bySteiner. He was spot on:There are beings in the spiritual realms for whom anxiety and fear emanating from humanbeings offer welcome food. When humans have no anxiety and fear, then these creaturesstarve. If fear and anxiety radiates from people and they break out in panic, then thesecreatures find welcome nutrition and they become more and more powerful. These beings arehostile towards humanity. Everything that feeds on negative feelings, on anxiety, fear andsuperstition, despair or doubt, are in reality hostile forces in super-sensible worlds, launchingcruel attacks on human beings, while they are being fed ... These are exactly the feelings thatbelong to contemporary culture and materialism; because it estranges people from thespiritual world, it is especially suited to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown inpeople, thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.Pause for a moment from this perspective and reflect on what hashappened in the world since the start of 2020.

If we want to actindependently, it demands that we don’t do so ... indeed we are held prisoner!They took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because weare their sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in coops, the predators rear us in human coops,humaneros. Therefore, their food is always available to them.Different cultures, different eras, same recurring theme.The ‘ennoia’ dilemmaNag Hammadi Gnostic manuscripts say that Archon consciousnesshas no ‘ennoia’. This is directly translated as ‘intentionality’, but I’lluse the term ‘creative imagination’. The All That Is in awareness ofitself is the source of all creativity – all possibility – and the moredisconnected you are from that source the more you aresubsequently denied ‘creative imagination’. Given that Archonconsciousness is almost entirely disconnected it severely lackscreativity and has to rely on far more mechanical processes ofthought and exploit the creative potential of those that do have‘ennoia’. You can see cases of this throughout human society. Archonconsciousness almost entirely dominates the global banking systemand if we study how that system works you will appreciate what Imean. Banks manifest ‘money’ out of nothing by issuing lines of‘credit’ which is ‘money’ that has never, does not, and will neverexist except in theory. It’s a confidence trick. If you think ‘credit’figures-on-a-screen ‘money’ is worth anything you accept it aspayment. If you don’t then the whole system collapses through lackof confidence in the value of that ‘money’. Archontic bankers withno ‘ennoia’ are ‘lending’ ‘money’ that doesn’t exist to humans that dohave creativity – those that have the inspired ideas and createbusinesses and products. Archon banking feeds off human creativity"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"which it controls through ‘money’ creation and debt. Humans havethe creativity and Archons exploit that for their own benefit andcontrol while having none themselves. Archon Internet platformslike Facebook claim joint copyright of everything that creative userspost and while Archontic minds like Zuckerberg may officially headthat company it will be human creatives on the staff that provide thecreative inspiration. When you have limitless ‘money’ you can thenbuy other companies established by creative humans. Witness theacquisition record of Facebook, Google and their like. Survey theArchon-controlled music industry and you see non-creative darksuit executives making their fortune from the human creativity oftheir artists. The cases are endless. Research the history of peoplelike Gates and Zuckerberg and how their empires were built onexploiting the creativity of others. Archon minds cannot create out ofnothing, but they are skilled (because they have to be) in whatGnostic texts call ‘countermimicry’. They can imitate, but notinnovate. Sabbatians trawl the creativity of others throughbackdoors they install in computer systems through theircybersecurity systems. Archon-controlled China is globally infamousfor stealing intellectual property and I remember how Hong Kong,now part of China, became notorious for making counterfeit copiesof the creativity of others – ‘countermimicry’. With the nowpervasive and all-seeing surveillance systems able to infiltrate anycomputer you can appreciate the potential for Archons to vampirethe creativity of humans. Author John Lamb Lash wrote in his bookabout the Nag Hammadi texts, Not In His Image:Although they cannot originate anything, because they lack the divine factor of ennoia(intentionality), Archons can imitate with a vengeance. Their expertise is simulation (HAL,virtual reality). The Demiurge [Yaldabaoth] fashions a heaven world copied from the fractalpatterns [of the original] ... His construction is celestial kitsch, like the fake Italianate villa of aMafia don complete with militant angels to guard every portal.This brings us to something that I have been speaking about sincethe turn of the millennium.

Well, virtuallyI had pondered for years about whether our reality is ‘real’ or somekind of construct. I remembered being immensely affected on a visitas a small child in the late 1950s to the then newly-openedPlanetarium on the Marylebone Road in London which is nowclosed and part of the adjacent Madame Tussauds wax museum. Itwas in the middle of the day, but when the lights went out there wasthe night sky projected in the Planetarium’s domed ceiling and itappeared to be so real. The experience never le\u0000 me and I didn’tknow why until around the turn of the millennium when I becamecertain that our ‘night sky’ and entire reality is a projection, a virtualreality, akin to the illusory world portrayed in the Matrix movies. Ilooked at the sky one day in this period and it appeared to me likethe domed roof of the Planetarium. The release of the first Matrixmovie in 1999 also provided a synchronistic and perfect visualrepresentation of where my mind had been going for a long time. Ihadn’t come across the Gnostic Nag Hammadi texts then. When Idid years later the correlation was once again astounding. As I readGnostic accounts from 1,600 years and more earlier it was clear thatthey were describing the same simulation phenomenon. They tellhow the Yaldabaoth ‘Demiurge’ and Archons created a ‘bad copy’ oforiginal reality to rule over all that were captured by its illusions andthe body was a prison to trap consciousness in the ‘bad copy’ fakereality. Read how Gnostics describe the ‘bad copy’ and update thatto current times and they are referring to what we would call today avirtual reality simulation.Author John Lamb Lash said ‘the Demiurge fashions a heavenworld copied from the fractal pa\u0000erns’ of the original throughexpertise in ‘HAL’ or virtual reality simulation. Fractal pa\u0000erns arepart of the energetic information construct of our reality, a sort ofblueprint. If these pa\u0000erns were copied in computer terms it wouldindeed give you a copy of a ‘natural’ reality in a non-naturalfrequency and digital form. The principle is the same as making acopy of a website. The original website still exists, but now you canchange the copy version to make it whatever you like and it can"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"become very different to the original website. Archons have donethis with our reality, a synthetic copy of prime reality that still existsbeyond the frequency walls of the simulation. Trapped within theillusions of this synthetic Matrix, however, were and are humanconsciousness and other expressions of prime reality and this is whythe Archons via the Cult are seeking to make the human bodysynthetic and give us synthetic AI minds to complete the job ofturning the entire reality synthetic including what we perceive to bethe natural world. To quote Kurzweil: ‘Nanobots will infuse all thema\u0000er around us with information. Rocks, trees, everything willbecome these intelligent creatures.’ Yes, synthetic ‘creatures’ just as‘Covid’ and other genetically-manipulating ‘vaccines’ are designedto make the human body synthetic. From this perspective it isobvious why Archons and their Cult are so desperate to infusesynthetic material into every human with their ‘Covid’ scam.Let there be (electromagnetic) lightYaldabaoth, the force that created the simulation, or Matrix, makessense of the Gnostic reference to ‘The Great Architect’ and its use byCult Freemasonry as the name of its deity. The designer of the Matrixin the movies is called ‘The Architect’ and that trilogy is jam-packedwith symbolism relating to these subjects. I have contended for yearsthat the angry Old Testament God (Yaldabaoth) is the ‘God’ beingsymbolically ‘quoted’ in the opening of Genesis as ‘creating theworld’. This is not the creation of prime reality – it’s the creation ofthe simulation. The Genesis ‘God’ says: ‘Let there be Light: and therewas light.’ But what is this ‘Light’? I have said for decades that thespeed of light (186,000 miles per second) is not the fastest speedpossible as claimed by mainstream science and is in fact thefrequency walls or outer limits of the Matrix. You can’t have a fastestor slowest anything within all possibility when everything ispossible. The human body is encoded to operate within the speed oflight or within the simulation and thus we see only the tiny frequencyband of visible light. Near-death experiencers who perceive realityoutside the body during temporary ‘death’ describe a very different"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"form of light and this is supported by the Nag Hammadi texts.Prime reality beyond the simulation (‘Upper Aeons’ to the Gnostics)is described as a realm of incredible beauty, bliss, love and harmony– a realm of ‘watery light’ that is so powerful ‘there are no shadows’.Our false reality of Archon control, which Gnostics call the ‘LowerAeons’, is depicted as a realm with a different kind of ‘light’ anddescribed in terms of chaos, ‘Hell’, ‘the Abyss’ and ‘Outer Darkness’,where trapped souls are tormented and manipulated by demons(relate that to the ‘Covid’ hoax alone). The watery light theme can befound in near-death accounts and it is not the same as simulation‘light’ which is electromagnetic or radiation light within the speed oflight – the ‘Lower Aeons’. Simulation ‘light’ is the ‘luminous fire’associated by Gnostics with the Archons. The Bible refers toYaldabaoth as ‘that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, whichdeceiveth the whole world’ (Revelation 12:9). I think that making asimulated copy of prime reality (‘countermimicry’) and changing itdramatically while all the time manipulating humanity to believe itto be real could probably meet the criteria of deceiving the wholeworld. Then we come to the Cult god Lucifer – the Light Bringer.Lucifer is symbolic of Yaldabaoth, the bringer of radiation light thatforms the bad copy simulation within the speed of light. ‘He’ issymbolised by the lighted torch held by the Statue of Liberty and inthe name ‘Illuminati’. Sabbatian-Frankism declares that Lucifer is thetrue god and Lucifer is the real god of Freemasonry honoured astheir ‘Great or Grand Architect of the Universe’ (simulation).I would emphasise, too, the way Archontic technologically-generated luminous fire of radiation has deluged our environmentsince I was a kid in the 1950s and changed the nature of The Fieldwith which we constantly interact. Through that interactiontechnological radiation is changing us. The Smart Grid is designed tooperate with immense levels of communication power with 5Gexpanding across the world and 6G, 7G, in the process ofdevelopment. Radiation is the simulation and the Archonticmanipulation system. Why wouldn’t the Archon Cult wish tounleash radiation upon us to an ever-greater extreme to form"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"Kurzweil’s ‘cloud’? The plan for a synthetic human is related to theneed to cope with levels of radiation beyond even anything we’veseen so far. Biological humans would not survive the scale ofradiation they have in their script. The Smart Grid is a technologicalsub-reality within the technological simulation to further disconnectfive-sense perception from expanded consciousness. It’s atechnological prison of the mind.Infusing the ‘spirit of darkness’A recurring theme in religion and native cultures is themanipulation of human genetics by a non-human force and mostfamously recorded as the biblical ‘sons of god’ (the gods plural in theoriginal) who interbred with the daughters of men. The NagHammadi Apocryphon of John tells the same story this way:He [Yaldabaoth] sent his angels [Archons/demons] to the daughters of men, that they mighttake some of them for themselves and raise offspring for their enjoyment. And at first they didnot succeed. When they had no success, they gathered together again and they made a plantogether ... And the angels changed themselves in their likeness into the likeness of theirmates, filling them with the spirit of darkness, which they had mixed for them, and with evil ...And they took women and begot children out of the darkness according to the likeness oftheir spirit.Possession when a discarnate entity takes over a human body is anage-old theme and continues today. It’s very real and I’ve seen it.Satanic and secret society rituals can create an energetic environmentin which entities can a\u0000ach to initiates and I’ve heard many storiesof how people have changed their personality a\u0000er being initiatedeven into lower levels of the Freemasons. I have been inside threeFreemasonic temples, one at a public open day and two by justwalking in when there was no one around to stop me. They were inRyde, the town where I live, Birmingham, England, when I was witha group, and Boston, Massachuse\u0000s. They all felt the sameenergetically – dark, dense, low-vibrational and sinister. Demonica\u0000achment can happen while the initiate has no idea what is goingon. To them it’s just a ritual to get in the Masons and do a bit of good"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"business. In the far more extreme rituals of Satanism humanpossession is even more powerful and they are designed to makepossession possible. The hierarchy of the Cult is dictated by thepower and perceived status of the possessing Archon. In this waythe Archon hierarchy becomes the Cult hierarchy. Once the entityhas a\u0000ached it can influence perception and behaviour and if ita\u0000aches to the extreme then so much of its energy (information)infuses into the body information field that the hologram starts toreflect the nature of the possessing entity. This is the Exorcist movietype of possession when facial features change and it’s known asshapeshi\u0000ing. Islam’s Jinn are said to be invisible tricksters whochange shape, ‘whisper’, confuse and take human form. These are alltraits of the Archons and other versions of the same phenomenon.Extreme possession could certainty infuse the ‘spirit of darkness’into a partner during sex as the Nag Hammadi texts appear todescribe. Such an infusion can change genetics which is alsoenergetic information. Human genetics is information and the ‘spiritof darkness’ is information. Mix one with the other and change musthappen. Islam has the concept of a ‘Jinn baby’ through possession ofthe mother and by Jinn taking human form. There are many waysthat human genetics can be changed and remember that Archonshave been aware all along of advanced techniques to do this. What isbeing done in human society today – and far more – was knownabout by Archons at the time of the ‘fallen ones’ and their otherversions described in religions and cultures.Archons and their human-world Cult are obsessed with geneticsas we see today and they know this dictates how information isprocessed into perceived reality during a human life. They needed toproduce a human form that would decode the simulation and this issymbolically known as ‘Adam and Eve’ who le\u0000 the ‘garden’ (primereality) and ‘fell’ into Matrix reality. The simulation is not a‘physical’ construct (there is no ‘physical’); it is a source ofinformation. Think Wi-Fi again. The simulation is an energetic fieldencoded with information and body-brain systems are designed todecode that information encoded in wave or frequency form which"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"is transmi\u0000ed to the brain as electrical signals. These are decoded bythe brain to construct our sense of reality – an illusory ‘physical’world that only exists in the brain or the mind. Virtual reality gamesmimic this process using the same sensory decoding system.Information is fed to the senses to decode a virtual reality that canappear so real, but isn’t (Figs 18 and 19). Some scientists believe –and I agree with them – that what we perceive as ‘physical’ realityonly exists when we are looking or observing. The act of perceptionor focus triggers the decoding systems which turn waveforminformation into holographic reality. When we are not observingsomething our reality reverts from a holographic state to a waveformstate. This relates to the same principle as a falling tree not making anoise unless someone is there to hear it or decode it. The conceptmakes sense from the simulation perspective. A computer is notdecoding all the information in a Wi-Fi field all the time and onlydecodes or brings into reality on the screen that part of Wi-Fi that it’sdecoding – focusing upon – at that moment.Figure 18: Virtual reality technology ‘hacks’ into the body’s five-sense decoding system.Figure 19: The result can be experienced as very ‘real’."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Interestingly, Professor Donald Hoffman at the Department ofCognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, says thatour experienced reality is like a computer interface that shows usonly the level with which we interact while hiding all that existsbeyond it: ‘Evolution shaped us with a user interface that hides thetruth. Nothing that we see is the truth – the very language of spaceand time and objects is the wrong language to describe reality.’ He iscorrect in what he says on so many levels. Space and time are not auniversal reality. They are a phenomenon of decoded simulationreality as part of the process of enslaving our sense of reality. Near-death experiencers report again and again how space and time didnot exist as we perceive them once they were free of the body – bodydecoding systems. You can appreciate from this why Archons andtheir Cult are so desperate to entrap human a\u0000ention in the fivesenses where we are in the Matrix and of the Matrix. Opening yourmind to expanded states of awareness takes you beyond theinformation confines of the simulation and you become aware ofknowledge and insights denied to you before. This is what we call‘awakening’ – awakening from the Matrix – and in the final chapter Iwill relate this to current events.Where are the ‘aliens’?A simulation would explain the so-called ‘Fermi Paradox’ nameda\u0000er Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) who created the firstnuclear reactor. He considered the question of why there is such alack of extraterrestrial activity when there are so many stars andplanets in an apparently vast universe; but what if the night sky thatwe see, or think we do, is a simulated projection as I say? If youcontrol the simulation and your aim is to hold humanity fast inessential ignorance would you want other forms of life includingadvanced life coming and going sharing information withhumanity? Or would you want them to believe they were isolatedand apparently alone? Themes of human isolation and apartness arecommon whether they be the perception of a lifeless universe or thefascist isolation laws of the ‘Covid’ era. Paradoxically the very"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"existence of a simulation means that we are not alone when someforce had to construct it. My view is that experiences that peoplehave reported all over the world for centuries with Reptilians andGrey entities are Archon phenomena as Nag Hammadi textsdescribe; and that benevolent ‘alien’ interactions are non-humangroups that come in and out of the simulation by overcomingArchon a\u0000empts to keep them out. It should be highlighted, too, thatReptilians and Greys are obsessed with genetics and technology asrelated by cultural accounts and those who say they have beenabducted by them. Technology is their way of overcoming some ofthe limitations in their creative potential and our technology-drivenand controlled human society of today is archetypical Archon-Reptilian-Grey modus operandi. Technocracy is really Archontocracy.The Universe does not have to be as big as it appears with asimulation. There is no space or distance only information decodedinto holographic reality. What we call ‘space’ is only the absence ofholographic ‘objects’ and that ‘space’ is The Field of energeticinformation which connects everything into a single whole. Thesame applies with the artificially-generated information field of thesimulation. The Universe is not big or small as a physical reality. It isdecoded information, that’s all, and its perceived size is decided bythe way the simulation is encoded to make it appear. The entirenight sky as we perceive it only exists in our brain and so where arethose ‘millions of light years’? The ‘stars’ on the ceiling of thePlanetarium looked a vast distance away.There’s another point to mention about ‘aliens’. I have beenhighlighting since the 1990s the plan to stage a fake ‘alien invasion’to justify the centralisation of global power and a world military.Nazi scientist Werner von Braun, who was taken to America byOperation Paperclip a\u0000er World War Two to help found NASA, toldhis American assistant Dr Carol Rosin about the Cult agenda whenhe knew he was dying in 1977. Rosin said that he told her about asequence that would lead to total human control by a one-worldgovernment. This included threats from terrorism, rogue nations,meteors and asteroids before finally an ‘alien invasion’. All of these"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"things, von Braun said, would be bogus and what I would refer to asa No-Problem-Reaction-Solution. Keep this in mind when ‘the aliensare coming’ is the new mantra. The aliens are not coming – they arealready here and they have infiltrated human society while lookinghuman. French-Canadian investigative journalist Serge Monast saidin 1994 that he had uncovered a NASA/military operation calledProject Blue Beam which fits with what Werner von Braun predicted.Monast died of a ‘heart a\u0000ack’ in 1996 the day a\u0000er he was arrestedand spent a night in prison. He was 51. He said Blue Beam was aplan to stage an alien invasion that would include religious figuresbeamed holographically into the sky as part of a global manipulationto usher in a ‘new age’ of worshipping what I would say is the Cult‘god’ Yaldabaoth in a one-world religion. Fake holographic asteroidsare also said to be part of the plan which again syncs with vonBraun. How could you stage an illusory threat from asteroids unlessthey were holographic inserts? This is pre\u0000y straightforward giventhe advanced technology outside the public arena and the fact thatour ‘physical’ reality is holographic anyway. Information fieldswould be projected and we would decode them into the illusion of a‘physical’ asteroid. If they can sell a global ‘pandemic’ with a ‘virus’that doesn’t exist what will humans not believe if government andmedia tell them?All this is particularly relevant as I write with the Pentagonplanning to release in June, 2021, information about ‘UFO sightings’.I have been following the UFO story since the early 1990s and thecommon theme throughout has been government and militarydenials and cover up. More recently, however, the Pentagon hassuddenly become more talkative and apparently open with AirForce pilot radar images released of unexplained cra\u0000 moving andchanging direction at speeds well beyond anything believed possiblewith human technology. Then, in March, 2021, former Director ofNational Intelligence John Ratcliffe said a Pentagon report monthslater in June would reveal a great deal of information about UFOsightings unknown to the public. He said the report would have‘massive implications’. The order to do this was included bizarrely"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"in a $2.3 trillion ‘coronavirus’ relief and government funding billpassed by the Trump administration at the end of 2020.

I have been pointing out sincethe 1990s that the US military and intelligence networks have longhad cra\u0000 – ‘flying saucers’ or anti-gravity cra\u0000 – which any observerwould take to be extraterrestrial in origin. Keeping this knowledgefrom the public allows cra\u0000 flown by humans to be perceived as alienvisitations. I am not saying that ‘aliens’ do not exist. I would be thelast one to say that, but we have to be streetwise here. PresidentRonald Reagan told the UN General Assembly in 1987: ‘Ioccasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide wouldvanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.’That’s the idea. Unite against a common ‘enemy’ with a commonpurpose behind your ‘saviour force’ (the Cult) as this age-oldtechnique of mass manipulation goes global.Science moves this way ...I could find only one other person who was discussing thesimulation hypothesis publicly when I concluded it was real. Thiswas Nick Bostrom, a Swedish-born philosopher at the University ofOxford, who has explored for many years the possibility that humanreality is a computer simulation although his version and mine arenot the same. Today the simulation and holographic realityhypothesis have increasingly entered the scientific mainstream. Well,the more open-minded mainstream, that is. Here are a few of theever-gathering examples. American nuclear physicist Silas Beane leda team of physicists at the University of Bonn in Germany pursuingthe question of whether we live in a simulation. They concluded thatwe probably do and it was likely based on a la\u0000ice of cubes. Theyfound that cosmic rays align with that specific pa\u0000ern. The teamhighlighted the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit which refersto cosmic ray particle interaction with cosmic background radiationthat creates an apparent boundary for cosmic ray particles. They sayin a paper entitled ‘Constraints on the Universe as a NumericalSimulation’ that this ‘pa\u0000ern of constraint’ is exactly what you"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"would find with a computer simulation. They also made the pointthat a simulation would create its own ‘laws of physics’ that wouldlimit possibility. I’ve been making the same point for decades thatthe perceived laws of physics relate only to this reality, or what Iwould later call the simulation. When designers write codes to createcomputer and virtual reality games they are the equivalent of thelaws of physics for that game. Players interact within the limitationslaid out by the coding. In the same way those who wrote the codesfor the simulation decided the laws of physics that would apply.These can be overridden by expanded states of consciousness, butnot by those enslaved in only five-sense awareness where simulationcodes rule. Overriding the codes is what people call ‘miracles’. Theyare not. They are bypassing the encoded limits of the simulation. Apopulation caught in simulation perception would have no idea thatthis was their plight. As the Bonn paper said: ‘Like a prisoner in apitch-black cell we would not be able to see the “walls” of ourprison,’ That’s true if people remain mesmerised by the five senses.Open to expanded awareness and those walls become very clear. Themain one is the speed of light.American theoretical physicist James Gates is another who hasexplored the simulation question and found considerable evidenceto support the idea. Gates was Professor of Physics at the Universityof Maryland, Director of The Center for String and Particle Theory,and on Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science andTechnology. He and his team found computer codes of digital dataembedded in the fabric of our reality. They relate to on-off electricalcharges of 1 and 0 in the binary system used by computers. ‘We haveno idea what they are doing there’, Gates said. They found withinthe energetic fabric mathematical sequences known as error-correcting codes or block codes that ‘reboot’ data to its original stateor ‘default se\u0000ings’ when something knocks it out of sync. Gates wasasked if he had found a set of equations embedded in our realityindistinguishable from those that drive search engines and browsersand he said: ‘That is correct.’ Rich Terrile, director of the Centre forEvolutionary Computation and Automated Design at NASA’s Jet"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"Propulsion Laboratory, has said publicly that he believes theUniverse is a digital hologram that must have been created by a formof intelligence. I agree with that in every way. Waveform informationis delivered electrically by the senses to the brain which constructs adigital holographic reality that we call the ‘world’. This digital levelof reality can be read by the esoteric art of numerology. Digitalholograms are at the cu\u0000ing edge of holographics today. We havedigital technology everywhere designed to access and manipulateour digital level of perceived reality. Synthetic mRNA in ‘Covidvaccines’ has a digital component to manipulate the body’s digital‘operating system’.Reality is numbersHow many know that our reality can be broken down to numbersand codes that are the same as computer games? Max Tegmark, aphysicist at the Massachuse\u0000s Institute of Technology (MIT), is theauthor of Our Mathematical Universe in which he lays out how realitycan be entirely described by numbers and maths in the way that avideo game is encoded with the ‘physics’ of computer games. Ourworld and computer virtual reality are essentially the same.Tegmark imagines the perceptions of characters in an advancedcomputer game when the graphics are so good they don’t know theyare in a game. They think they can bump into real objects(electromagnetic resistance in our reality), fall in love and feelemotions like excitement. When they began to study the apparently‘physical world’ of the video game they would realise thateverything was made of pixels (which have been found in ourenergetic reality as must be the case when on one level our world isdigital). What computer game characters thought was physical‘stuff’, Tegmark said, could actually be broken down into numbers:And we’re exactly in this situation in our world. We look around and it doesn’t seem thatmathematical at all, but everything we see is made out of elementary particles like quarks andelectrons. And what properties does an electron have? Does it have a smell or a colour or atexture? No! ... We physicists have come up with geeky names for [Electron] properties, like"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"electric charge, or spin, or lepton number, but the electron doesn’t care what we call it, theproperties are just numbers.This is the illusory reality Gnostics were describing. This is thesimulation. The A, C, G, and T codes of DNA have a binary value –A and C = 0 while G and T = 1. This has to be when the simulation isdigital and the body must be digital to interact with it. Recurringmathematical sequences are encoded throughout reality and thebody. They include the Fibonacci sequence in which the twoprevious numbers are added to get the next one, as in ... 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The sequence is encoded in the human face andbody, proportions of animals, DNA, seed heads, pine cones, trees,shells, spiral galaxies, hurricanes and the number of petals in aflower. The list goes on and on. There are fractal pa\u0000erns – a ‘never-ending pa\u0000ern that is infinitely complex and self-similar across allscales in the as above, so below, principle of holograms. These andother famous recurring geometrical and mathematical sequencessuch as Phi, Pi, Golden Mean, Golden Ratio and Golden Section arecomputer codes of the simulation. I had to laugh and give my head ashake the day I finished this book and it went into the productionstage. I was sent an article in Scientific American published in April,2021, with the headline ‘Confirmed! We Live in a Simulation’. Twodecades a\u0000er I first said our reality is a simulation and the speed oflight is it’s outer limit the article suggested that we do live in asimulation and that the speed of light is its outer limit. I le\u0000 school at15 and never passed a major exam in my life while the writer was upto his eyes in qualifications. As I will explain in the final chapterknowing is far be\u0000er than thinking and they come from very differentsources. The article rightly connected the speed of light to theprocessing speed of the ‘Matrix’ and said what has been in my booksall this time ... ‘If we are in a simulation, as it appears, then space isan abstract property wri\u0000en in code. It is not real’. No it’s not and ifwe live in a simulation something created it and it wasn’t us. ‘ThatDavid Icke says we are manipulated by aliens’ – he’s crackers.’"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"Wow ...The reality that humanity thinks is so real is an illusion.

Revealed here is theknowledge kept under raps in the Cult networks ofcompartmentalised secrecy to control humanity’s sense of reality byinducing the population to believe in a reality that’s not real. If itwasn’t so tragic in its experiential consequences the whole thingwould be hysterically funny. None of this is new to Renegade Minds.Ancient Greek philosopher Plato (about 428 to about 347BC) was amajor influence on Gnostic belief and he described the human plightthousands of years ago with his Allegory of the Cave. He told thesymbolic story of prisoners living in a cave who had never beenoutside. They were chained and could only see one wall of the cavewhile behind them was a fire that they could not see. Figures walkedpast the fire casting shadows on the prisoners’ wall and thosemoving shadows became their sense of reality. Some prisoners beganto study the shadows and were considered experts on them (today’sacademics and scientists), but what they studied was only an illusion(today’s academics and scientists). A prisoner escaped from the caveand saw reality as it really is. When he returned to report thisrevelation they didn’t believe him, called him mad and threatened tokill him if he tried to set them free.

Efforts to do this have increased dramaticallywith identity politics as identity bubbles are squeezed into theminutiae of five-sense detail which disconnect people even moreprofoundly from the infinite ‘I’.Five-sense focus and self-identity are like a firewall that limitsaccess to the infinite realms.

Archons seek to control that point where the operatorconnects with the computer to stop that interaction (Fig 20). Now theoperator is banging the keyboard and clicking the mouse, but thecomputer is not responding and this happens when the computer istaken over – possessed – by an appropriately-named computer ‘virus’.The operator has lost all influence over the computer which goes itsown way making decisions under the control of the ‘virus’.

Wetiko isthe spelling used by the Cree and there are other versions includingwintiko and windigo used by other tribal groups. They spell thename with lower case, but I see Wetiko as a proper noun as withArchons and prefer a capital. I first saw an article about Wetiko bywriter and researcher Paul Levy which so synced with what I hadbeen writing about the computer/operator disconnection and laterthe Archons. I then read his book, the fascinating Dispelling Wetiko,Breaking the Spell of Evil. The parallels between what I had concludedlong before and the Native American concept of Wetiko were soclear and obvious that it was almost funny.

Forbes, a founder ofthe Native American movement in the 1960s, wrote another bookabout Wetiko entitled Columbus And Other Cannibals – The WetikoDisease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism which I also read.Forbes says that Wetiko refers to an evil person or spirit ‘whoterrorizes other creatures by means of terrible acts, includingcannibalism’. Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa told me that Africanaccounts tell how cannibalism was brought into the world by theChitauri ‘gods’ – another manifestation of Wetiko. The distinctionbetween ‘evil person or spirit’ relates to Archons/Wetiko possessinga human or acting as pure consciousness. Wetiko is said to be asickness of the soul or spirit and a state of being that takes but givesnothing back – the Cult and its operatives perfectly described. BlackHawk, a Native American war leader defending their lands fromconfiscation, said European invaders had ‘poisoned hearts’ – Wetikohearts – and that this would spread to native societies. Mention ofthe heart is very significant as we shall shortly see. Forbes writes:‘Tragically, the history of the world for the past 2,000 years is, ingreat part, the story of the epidemiology of the wetiko disease.’ Yes,and much longer. Forbes is correct when he says: ‘The wetikosdestroyed Egypt and Babylon and Athens and Rome andTenochtitlan [capital of the Aztec empire] and perhaps now they willdestroy the entire earth.’ Evil, he said, is the number one export of aWetiko culture – see its globalisation with ‘Covid’. Constant war,mass murder, suffering of all kinds, child abuse, Satanism, tortureand human sacrifice are all expressions of Wetiko and the Wetikopossessed.

Once thisconnection is made Wetiko can drive the perceptions of the targetwhich they believe to be coming from their own mind. All thehorrors of history and today from mass killers to Satanists,paedophiles like Jeffrey Epstein and other psychopaths, are theembodiment of Wetiko and express its state of being in all itsgrotesqueness. The Cult is Wetiko incarnate, Yaldabaoth incarnate,and it seeks to facilitate Wetiko assimilation of humanity in totalityinto its distortion by manipulating the population into lowfrequency states that match its own. Paul Levy writes:‘Holographically enforced within the psyche of every human beingthe wetiko virus pervades and underlies the entire field ofconsciousness, and can therefore potentially manifest through anyone of us at any moment if we are not mindful.’ The ‘Covid’ hoaxhas achieved this with many people, but others have not fallen intoWetiko’s frequency lair.

The perceptual divide that has now become a chasm isbetween the Wetikoed and the non-Wetikoed.Paul Levy describes Wetiko in the same way that I have longdescribed the Archontic force. They are the same distortedconsciousness operating across dimensions of reality: ‘... the subtlebody of wetiko is not located in the third dimension of space andtime, literally existing in another dimension ... it is able to affectordinary lives by mysteriously interpenetrating into our three-dimensional world.’ Wetiko does this through its incarnaterepresentatives in the Cult and by weaving itself into The Fieldwhich on our level of reality is the electromagnetic information fieldof the simulation or Matrix. More than that, the simulation is Wetiko/ Yaldabaoth. Caleb Scharf, Director of Astrobiology at ColumbiaUniversity, has speculated that ‘alien life’ could be so advanced thatit has transcribed itself into the quantum realm to become what wecall physics. He said intelligence indistinguishable from the fabric ofthe Universe would solve many of its greatest mysteries:Perhaps hyper-advanced life isn’t just external. Perhaps it’s already all around. It is embeddedin what we perceive to be physics itself, from the root behaviour of particles and fields to thephenomena of complexity and emergence ... In other words, life might not just be in theequations. It might BE the equations [My emphasis].Scharf said it is possible that ‘we don’t recognise advanced lifebecause it forms an integral and unsuspicious part of what we’veconsidered to be the natural world’.

We all have the power to overcome Wetiko"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"influence and the Cult knows that. I doubt it sleeps too well becauseit knows that.Which Field?This, I suggest, is how it all works. There are two Fields. One is thefierce electromagnetic light of the Matrix within the speed of light;the other is the ‘watery light’ of The Field beyond the walls of theMatrix that connects with the Great Infinity. Five-sense mind and thedecoding systems of the body a\u0000ach us to the Field of Matrix light.They have to or we could not experience this reality. Five-sense mindsees only the Matrix Field of information while our expandedconsciousness is part of the Infinity Field. When we open our minds,and most importantly our hearts, to the Infinity Field we have amission control which gives us an expanded perspective, a roadmap, to understand the nature of the five-sense world. If we areisolated only in five-sense mind there is no mission control. We’re onour own trying to understand a world that’s constantly feeding usinformation to ensure we do not understand. People in this state canfeel ‘lost’ and bewildered with no direction or radar. You can seeever more clearly those who are influenced by the Fields of BigInfinity or li\u0000le five-sense mind simply by their views and behaviourwith regard to the ‘Covid’ hoax. We have had this divisionthroughout known human history with the mass of the people onone side and individuals who could see and intuit beyond the wallsof the simulation – Plato’s prisoner who broke out of the cave andsaw reality for what it is. Such people have always been targeted byWetiko/Archon-possessed authority, burned at the stake ordemonised as mad, bad and dangerous.

Political parties act the same whileclaiming to be different for the same reason. Secret society andsatanic rituals are a\u0000aching initiates to Wetiko and the cold, ruthless,psychopathic mentality that secures the positions of power all overthe world is Wetiko. Reframing ‘training programmes’ have thesame cumulative effect of a\u0000aching Wetiko and we have theirgraduates described as automatons and robots with a cold,psychopathic, uncaring demeanour. They are all traits of Wetikopossession and look how many times they have been described inthis book and elsewhere with regard to personnel behind ‘Covid’including the police and medical profession. Climbing the greasypole in any profession in a Wetiko society requires traits of Wetiko toget there and that is particularly true of politics which is not aboutfair competition and pre-eminence of ideas. It is founded on howmany backs you can stab and arses you can lick. This culminated inthe global ‘Covid’ coordination between the Wetiko possessed whopulled it off in all the different countries without a trace of empathyand compassion for their impact on humans. Our sight sense can seeonly holographic form and not the Field which connects holographicform. Therefore we perceive ‘physical’ objects with ‘space’ inbetween. In fact that ‘space’ is energy/consciousness operating onmultiple frequencies. One of them is Wetiko and that connects theCult psychopaths, those who submit to the psychopaths, and thosewho serve the psychopaths in the media operations of the world.Wetiko is Gates. Wetiko is the mask-wearing submissive. Wetiko isthe fake journalist and ‘fact-checker’. The Wetiko Field iscoordinating the whole thing. Psychopaths, gofers, mediaoperatives, ‘anti-hate’ hate groups, ‘fact-checkers’ and submissivepeople work as one unit even without human coordination because theyare a\u0000ached to the same Field which is organising it all (Fig 22).

Once an unconscious content takes possession of certainindividuals, it irresistibly draws them together by mutual attraction and knits them into groupstied together by their shared madness that can easily swell into an avalanche of insanity.A psychic epidemic is a closed system, which is to say that it is insular and not open to anynew information or informing influences from the outside world which contradict its fixed,limited, and limiting perspective.There we have the Woke mind and the ‘Covid’ mind.

Wetiko’s worst nightmare is for humanconsciousness to expand beyond the simulation. Everything isfocussed on stopping that happening through control ofinformation, thus perception, thus frequency. The ‘educationsystem’, media, science, medicine, academia, are all geared tomaintaining humanity in five-sense servitude as is the constantstimulation of low-vibrational mental and emotional states (see‘Covid’). Wetiko seeks to dominate those subconscious spacesbetween five-sense perception and expanded consciousness wherethe computer meets the operator. From these subconscious hidingplaces Wetiko speaks to us to trigger urges and desires that we taketo be our own and manipulate us into anything from low-vibrationalto psychopathic states. Remember how Islam describes the Jinn asinvisible tricksters that ‘whisper’ and confuse. Wetiko is the origin ofthe ‘trickster god’ theme that you find in cultures all over the world.Jinn, like the Archons, are Wetiko which is terrified of humansawakening and reconnecting with our true self for then its energysource has gone. With that the feedback loop breaks between Wetikoand human perception that provides the energetic momentum onwhich its very existence depends as a force of evil. Humans are bothits target and its source of survival, but only if we are operating inlow-vibrational states of fear, hate, depression and the backgroundanxiety that most people suffer. We are Wetiko’s target because weare its key to survival. It needs us, not the other way round. PaulLevy writes:A vampire has no intrinsic, independent, substantial existence in its own right; it only exists inrelation to us. The pathogenic, vampiric mind-parasite called wetiko is nothing in itself – notbeing able to exist from its own side – yet it has a ‘virtual reality’ such that it can potentiallydestroy our species ......The fact that a vampire is not reflected by a mirror can also mean that what we need to seeis that there’s nothing, no-thing to see, other than ourselves.

Paul Levy writes: ‘Due to the primal fear whichultimately drives it and which it is driven to cultivate, wetiko’s bodypolitic has an intrinsic and insistent need for centralising power andcontrol so as to create imagined safety for itself.’ Yeeeeeees! Exactly!Why does Wetiko want humans in an ongoing state of fear? Wetikoitself is fear and it is petrified of love. As evil is an absence of love, solove is an absence of fear. Love conquers all and especially Wetikowhich is fear. Wetiko brought fear into the world when it wasn’t herebefore. Fear was the ‘fall’, the fall into low-frequency ignorance andillusion – fear is False Emotion Appearing Real. The simulation isdriven and energised by fear because Wetiko/Yaldabaoth (fear) arethe simulation.

Most people think thelaw is the law as in one law. This is not the case. There are twobodies of law, Common Law and Statute Law, and they are not thesame. Common Law is founded on the simple premise of do noharm. It does not recognise victimless crimes in which no harm isdone while Statute Law does. There is a Statute Law against almosteverything. So what is Statute Law? Amazingly it’s the law of the seathat was brought ashore by the Cult to override the law of the landwhich is Common Law. They had no right to do this and as alwaysthey did it anyway. They had to. They could not impose their will onthe people through Common Law which only applies to do no harm.How could you stitch up the fine detail of people’s lives with that?Instead they took the law of the sea, or Admiralty Law, and appliedit to the population. Statute Law refers to all the laws spewing out ofgovernments and their agencies including all the fascist laws andregulations relating to ‘Covid’. The key point to make is that StatuteLaw is contract law. It only applies between contracting corporations.Most police officers don’t even know this. They have to be kept inthe dark, too. Long ago when merchants and their sailing shipsbegan to trade with different countries a contractual law wasdeveloped called Admiralty Law and other names. Again it onlyapplied to contracts agreed between corporate entities. If there is noagreed contract the law of the sea had no jurisdiction and that stillapplies to its new alias of Statute Law. The problem for the Cult whenthe law of the sea was brought ashore was an obvious one. Peoplewere not corporations and neither were government entities. Toovercome the la\u0000er they made governments and all associatedorganisations corporations.

This is why you hear the mantra about law enforcementpolicing by consent of the people. In truth the people ‘consent’ onlyin theory through monumental trickery.Okay, the Cult overcame the corporate law problem by makinggovernments and institutions corporate entities; but what aboutpeople? They are not corporations are they? Ah ... well in a sense,and only a sense, they are. Not people exactly – the illusion ofpeople. The Cult creates a corporation in the name of everyone at thetime that their birth certificate is issued. Note birth/ berth certificateand when you go to court under the law of the sea on land you standin a dock. These are throwbacks to the origin. My Common Lawname is David Vaughan Icke. The name of the corporation createdby the government when I was born is called Mr David VaughanIcke usually wri\u0000en in capitals as MR DAVID VAUGHAN ICKE.That is not me, the living, breathing man.

Legalese is the language of Statue Law which usesterms that mean one thing to the public and another in legalese.Notice that when a police officer tells someone why they are beingcharged he or she will say at the end: ‘Do you understand?’ To thepublic that means ‘Do you comprehend?’ In legalese it means ‘Doyou stand under me?’ Do you stand under my authority?

They aredeceiving you and another way they do this is to ask for proof ofidentity. You usually show them a driving licence or other documenton which your corporate name is wri\u0000en.

If you are approached by a police officeryou identify yourself immediately as a living, breathing, man orwoman and say ‘I do not consent, I do not contract with you and I donot understand’ or stand under their authority. I have a CommonLaw birth certificate as a living man and these are available at nocharge from commonlawcourt.com. Businesses registered under theStatute Law system means that its laws apply. There are, however,ways to run a business under Common Law. Remember all ‘Covid’laws and regulations are Statute Law – the law of contracts and youdo not have to contract. This doesn’t mean that you can kill someoneand get away with it. Common Law says do no harm and thatapplies to physical harm, financial harm etc. Police are employees ofprivate corporations and there needs to be a new system of non-corporate Common Law constables operating outside the StatuteLaw system.

How does blood in the feet sofar from the heart get pumped horizontally up the body by theheart?? Cowan explains in the book the real reason why bloodmoves as it does. Our ‘physical’ heart is used to symbolise love whenthe source is really the heart vortex or spiritual heart which is ourmost powerful energetic connection to ‘out there’ expandedconsciousness. That’s why we feel knowing – intuitive knowing – inthe centre of the chest. Knowing doesn’t come from a process ofthoughts leading to a conclusion. It is there in an instant all in onego. Our heart knows because of its connection to levels of awarenessthat do know. This is the meaning and source of intuition – intuitiveknowing.For the last more than 30 years of uncovering the global game andthe nature of reality my heart has been my constant antenna fortruth and accuracy.

To materialistic doctors will be entrusted the task of removing the soul of humanity.As today, people are vaccinated against this disease or that disease, so in the future, childrenwill be vaccinated with a substance that can be produced precisely in such a way that people,thanks to this vaccination, will be immune to being subjected to the ‘madness’ of spiritual life.He would be extremely smart, but he would not develop a conscience, and that is the truegoal of some materialistic circles.Steiner said the vaccine would detach the physical body from theetheric body (subtle bodies) and ‘once the etheric body is detachedthe relationship between the universe and the etheric body wouldbecome extremely unstable, and man would become an automaton’.He said ‘the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth byspiritual will – so the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique(Wetiko) force’ and ‘man can no longer get rid of a givenmaterialistic feeling’.

Same old, sameold. Media articles in mid-February were asking why India had beenso untouched by ‘Covid’ and then as their vaccine rollout gatheredpace the alleged ‘cases’ began to rapidly increase. Indian ‘Covidvaccine’ maker Bharat Biotech was funded into existence by the Billand Melinda Gates Foundation (the pair announced their divorce inMay, 2021, which is a pity because they so deserve each other). TheIndian ‘Covid crisis’ was ramped up by the media to terrify theworld and prepare people for submission to still more restrictions.The scam that worked the first time was being repeated only with farmore people seeing through the deceit. Davidicke.com andIckonic.com have sought to tell the true story of what is happeningby talking to people living through the Indian nightmare which hasnothing to do with ‘Covid’. We posted a le\u0000er from ‘Alisha’ in Punewho told a very different story to government and media mendacity.She said scenes of dying people and overwhelmed hospitals weredesigned to hide what was really happening – genocide andstarvation.

The cops wait at all major crossroadsto question why you are traveling outdoors or to fine you if you are not wearing a mask.The medical community here is also complicit in genocide, lying about hospitals being fulland turning away people with genuine illnesses, who need immediate care. They have evencreated a shortage of oxygen cylinders.This is the classic Cult modus operandi played out in every country.Alisha said that people who would not have a PCR test not testingfor the ‘virus’ were being denied hospital treatment. She said thepeople hit hardest were migrant workers and those in rural areas.Most businesses employed migrant workers and with everythingclosed there were no jobs, no income and no food. As a resultmillions were dying of starvation or malnutrition. All this washappening under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a 100-percentasset of the Cult, and it emphasises yet again the scale of pure anti-human evil we are dealing with. Australia banned its people fromreturning home from India with penalties for trying to do so of up tofive years in jail and a fine of £37,000. The manufactured ‘Covid’crisis in India was being prepared to justify further fascism in theWest. Obvious connections could be seen between the Indian‘vaccine’ programme and increased ‘cases’ and this became acommon theme. The Seychelles, the most per capita ‘Covidvaccinated’ population in the world, went back into lockdown a\u0000er a‘surge of cases’.Long ago the truly evil Monsanto agricultural biotechnologycorporation with its big connections to Bill Gates devastated Indianfarming with genetically-modified crops. Human rights activistGurcharan Singh highlighted the efforts by the Indian governmentto complete the job by destroying the food supply to hundreds ofmillions with ‘Covid’ lockdowns. He said that 415 million people atthe bo\u0000om of the disgusting caste system (still going whatever theysay) were below the poverty line and struggled to feed themselvesevery year.

People may reel back at the suggestion that agovernment would do that, but Wetiko-controlled ‘leaders’ arecapable of any level of evil. In fact what is described in India is in theprocess of being instigated worldwide. The food chain and foodsupply are being targeted at every level to cause world hunger andthus control. Bill Gates is not the biggest owner of farmland inAmerica for no reason and destroying access to food aids both thedepopulation agenda and the plan for synthetic ‘food’ already beingfunded into existence by Gates. Add to this the coming hyper-inflation from the suicidal creation of fake ‘money’ in response to‘Covid’ and the breakdown of container shipping systems and youhave a cocktail that can only lead one way and is meant to. The Cultplan is to crash the entire system to ‘build back be\u0000er’ with the GreatReset.‘Vaccine’ transmissionReports from all over the world continue to emerge of womensuffering menstrual and fertility problems a\u0000er having the fake‘vaccine’ and of the non-’vaccinated’ having similar problems wheninteracting with the ‘vaccinated’. There are far too many for‘coincidence’ to be credible. We’ve had menopausal women ge\u0000ingperiods, others having periods stop or not stopping for weeks,passing clots, sometimes the lining of the uterus, breastirregularities, and miscarriages (which increased by 400 percent inparts of the United States). Non-‘vaccinated’ men and children havesuffered blood clots and nose bleeding a\u0000er interaction with the‘vaccinated’. Babies have died from the effects of breast milk from a‘vaccinated’ mother. Awake doctors – the small minority –speculated on the cause of non-’vaccinated’ suffering the sameeffects as the ‘vaccinated’. Was it nanotechnology in the syntheticsubstance transmi\u0000ing frequencies or was it a straight chemicalbioweapon that was being transmi\u0000ed between people? I am notsaying that some kind of chemical transmission is not one possibleanswer, but the foundation of all that the Cult does is frequency and"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"this is fertile ground for understanding how transmission canhappen. American doctor Carrie Madej, an internal medicinephysician and osteopath, has been practicing for the last 20 years,teaching medical students, and she says a\u0000ending different meetingswhere the agenda for humanity was discussed. Madej, who operatesout of Georgia, did not dismiss other possible forms of transmission,but she focused on frequency in search of an explanation fortransmission. She said the Moderna and Pfizer ‘vaccines’ containednano-lipid particles as a key component. This was a brand newtechnology never before used on humanity. ‘They’re using ananotechnology which is pre\u0000y much li\u0000le tiny computer bits ...nanobots or hydrogel.’ Inside the ‘vaccines’ was ‘this sci-fi kind ofsubstance’ which suppressed immune checkpoints to get into thecell. I referred to this earlier as the ‘Trojan horse’ technique thattricks the cell into opening a gateway for the self-replicatingsynthetic material and while the immune system is artificiallysuppressed the body has no defences. Madej said the substanceserved many purposes including an on-demand ability to ‘deliverthe payload’ and using the nano ‘computer bits’ as biosensors in thebody. ‘It actually has the ability to accumulate data from your body,like your breathing, your respiration, thoughts, emotions, all kindsof things.’She said the technology obviously has the ability to operatethrough Wi-Fi and transmit and receive energy, messages,frequencies or impulses. ‘Just imagine you’re ge\u0000ing this newsubstance in you and it can react to things all around you, the 5G,your smart device, your phones.’ We had something completelyforeign in the human body that had never been launched large scaleat a time when we were seeing 5G going into schools and hospitals(plus the Musk satellites) and she believed the ‘vaccine’ transmissionhad something to do with this: ‘... if these people have this inside ofthem ... it can act like an antenna and actually transmit it outwardlyas well.’ The synthetic substance produced its own voltage and so itcould have that kind of effect. This fits with my own contention thatthe nano receiver-transmi\u0000ers are designed to connect people to the"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"Smart Grid and break the receiver-transmi\u0000er connection toexpanded consciousness. That would explain the French energyhealer’s experience of the disconnection of body from ‘soul’ withthose who have had the ‘vaccine’. The nanobots, self-replicatinginside the body, would also transmit the synthetic frequency whichcould be picked up through close interaction by those who have notbeen ‘vaccinated’. Madej speculated that perhaps it was 5G andincreased levels of other radiation that was causing the symptomsdirectly although interestingly she said that non-‘vaccinated’patients had shown improvement when they were away from the‘vaccinated’ person they had interacted with. It must be rememberedthat you can control frequency and energy with your mind and youcan consciously create energetic barriers or bubbles with the mind tostop damaging frequencies from penetrating your field. Americanpaediatrician Dr Larry Palevsky said the ‘vaccine’ was not a ‘vaccine’and was never designed to protect from a ‘viral’ infection. He calledit ‘a massive, brilliant propaganda of genocide’ because they didn’thave to inject everyone to get the result they wanted. He said thecontent of the jabs was able to infuse any material into the brain,heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, sperm and female productive system.‘This is genocide; this is a weapon of mass destruction.’ At the sametime American colleges were banning students from a\u0000ending ifthey didn’t have this life-changing and potentially life-ending‘vaccine’. Class action lawsuits must follow when the consequencesof this college fascism come to light. As the book was going to presscame reports about fertility effects on sperm in ‘vaccinated’ menwhich would absolutely fit with what I have been saying andhospitals continued to fill with ‘vaccine’ reactions. Another questionis what about transmission via blood transfusions? The NHS hasextended blood donation restrictions from seven days a\u0000er a ‘Covidvaccination’ to 28 days a\u0000er even a sore arm reaction.I said in the spring of 2020 that the then touted ‘Covid vaccine’would be ongoing each year like the flu jab. A year later Pfizer CEO,the appalling Albert Bourla, said people would ‘likely’ need a‘booster dose’ of the ‘vaccine’ within 12 months of ge\u0000ing ‘fully"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"vaccinated’ and then a yearly shot. ‘Variants will play a key role’, hesaid confirming the point. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky alsotook time out from his ‘vaccine’ disaster to say that people may needto be vaccinated against ‘Covid-19’ each year. UK Health Secretary,the psychopath Ma\u0000 Hancock, said additional ‘boosters’ would beavailable in the autumn of 2021. This is the trap of the ‘vaccinepassport’. The public will have to accept every last ‘vaccine’ theyintroduce, including for the fake ‘variants’, or it would cease to bevalid. The only other way in some cases would be continuous testingwith a test not testing for the ‘virus’ and what is on the swabsconstantly pushed up your noise towards the brain every time?‘Vaccines’ changing behaviourI mentioned in the body of the book how I believed we would seegathering behaviour changes in the ‘vaccinated’ and I am alreadyhearing such comments from the non-‘vaccinated’ describingbehaviour changes in friends, loved ones and work colleagues. Thiswill only increase as the self-replicating synthetic material andnanoparticles expand in body and brain. An article in the Guardian in2016 detailed research at the University of Virginia in Charlo\u0000esvillewhich developed a new method for controlling brain circuitsassociated with complex animal behaviour. The method, dubbed‘magnetogenetics’, involves genetically-engineering a protein calledferritin, which stores and releases iron, to create a magnetisedsubstance – ‘Magneto’ – that can activate specific groups of nervecells from a distance. This is claimed to be an advance on othermethods of brain activity manipulation known as optogenetics andchemogenetics (the Cult has been developing methods of braincontrol for a long time). The ferritin technique is said to be non-invasive and able to activate neurons ‘rapidly and reversibly’. Inother words, human thought and perception. The article said thatearlier studies revealed how nerve cell proteins ‘activated by heatand mechanical pressure can be genetically engineered so that theybecome sensitive to radio waves and magnetic fields, by a\u0000achingthem to an iron-storing protein called ferritin, or to inorganic"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"paramagnetic particles’. Sensitive to radio waves and magneticfields? You mean like 5G, 6G and 7G? This is the human-AI SmartGrid hive mind we are talking about. The Guardian article said:... the researchers injected Magneto into the striatum of freely behaving mice, a deep brainstructure containing dopamine-producing neurons that are involved in reward and motivation,and then placed the animals into an apparatus split into magnetised and non-magnetisedsections.Mice expressing Magneto spent far more time in the magnetised areas than mice that did not,because activation of the protein caused the striatal neurons expressing it to releasedopamine, so that the mice found being in those areas rewarding. This shows that Magnetocan remotely control the firing of neurons deep within the brain, and also control complexbehaviours.Make no mistake this basic methodology will be part of the ‘Covidvaccine’ cocktail and using magnetics to change brain functionthrough electromagnetic field frequency activation. The Pentagon isdeveloping a ‘Covid vaccine’ using ferritin. Magnetics would explainchanges in behaviour and why videos are appearing across theInternet as I write showing how magnets stick to the skin at thepoint of the ‘vaccine’ shot. Once people take these ‘vaccines’anything becomes possible in terms of brain function and illnesswhich will be blamed on ‘Covid-19’ and ‘variants’. Magnetic fieldmanipulation would further explain why the non-‘vaccinated’ arereporting the same symptoms as the ‘vaccinated’ they interact withand why those symptoms are reported to decrease when not in theircompany. Interestingly ‘Magneto’, a ‘mutant’, is a character in theMarvel Comic X-Men stories with the ability to manipulate magneticfields and he believes that mutants should fight back against theirhuman oppressors by any means necessary. The character was bornErik Lehnsherr to a Jewish family in Germany.Cult-controlled courtsThe European Court of Human Rights opened the door formandatory ‘Covid-19 vaccines’ across the continent when it ruled ina Czech Republic dispute over childhood immunisation that legally"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"enforced vaccination could be ‘necessary in a democratic society’.The 17 judges decided that compulsory vaccinations did not breachhuman rights law.

Vaccination disputes that come before themare invariably delivered in favour of doctors and authoritiesrepresenting the view of the state which owns the judiciary.

Cult-owned fascist YouTubeCEO Susan Wojcicki spoke at the 2021 WEF Global TechnologyGovernance Summit (see the name) in which 40 governments and150 companies met to ensure ‘the responsible design anddeployment of emerging technologies’. Orwellian translation:‘Ensuring the design and deployment of long-planned technologieswill advance the Cult agenda for control and censorship.’ Freedom-destroyer and Nuremberg-bound Wojcicki expressed support fortech platforms like hers to censor content that is ‘technically legal butcould be harmful’. Who decides what is ‘harmful’? She does andthey do. ‘Harmful’ will be whatever the Cult doesn’t want people tosee and we have legislation proposed by the UK government thatwould censor content on the basis of ‘harm’ no ma\u0000er if theinformation is fair, legal and provably true. Make that especially if itis fair, legal and provably true. Wojcicki called for a global coalitionto be formed to enforce content moderation standards throughautomated censorship. This is a woman and mega-censor so self-deluded that she shamelessly accepted a ‘free expression’ award –Wojcicki – in an event sponsored by her own YouTube. They have noshame and no self-awareness.You know that ‘Covid’ is a scam and Wojcicki a Cult operativewhen YouTube is censoring medical and scientific opinion purely onthe grounds of whether it supports or opposes the Cult ‘Covid’narrative. Florida governor Ron DeSantis compiled an expert panelwith four professors of medicine from Harvard, Oxford, andStanford Universities who spoke against forcing children and"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"vaccinated people to wear masks. They also said there was no proofthat lockdowns reduced spread or death rates of ‘Covid-19’. Cult-gofer Wojcicki and her YouTube deleted the panel video ‘because itincluded content that contradicts the consensus of local and globalhealth authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent thespread of Covid-19’. This ‘consensus’ refers to what the Cult tells theWorld Health Organization to say and the WHO tells ‘local healthauthorities’ to do. Wojcicki knows this, of course. The panellistspointed out that censorship of scientific debate was responsible fordeaths from many causes, but Wojcicki couldn’t care less. She wouldnot dare go against what she is told and as a disgrace to humanityshe wouldn’t want to anyway. The UK government is seeking to passa fascist ‘Online Safety Bill’ to specifically target with massive finesand other means non-censored video and social media platforms tomake them censor ‘lawful but harmful’ content like the Cult-ownedFacebook, Twi\u0000er, Google and YouTube.

There are two versions – it happened by accident and ithappened on purpose. Both are nonsense. The perceived existence ofthe never-shown-to-exist ‘virus’ is vital to sell the impression thatthere is actually an infective agent to deal with and to allow theendless potential for terrifying the population with ‘variants’ of a‘virus’ that does not exist. The authorities at the time of writing aregoing with the ‘by accident’ while the alternative media ispromoting the ‘on purpose’. Cable news host Tucker Carlson whohas questioned aspects of lockdown and ‘vaccine’ compulsion hasbought the Wuhan lab story. ‘Everyone now agrees’ he said. Well, Idon’t and many others don’t and the question is why does the systemand its media suddenly ‘agree’? When the media moves as one unitwith a narrative it is always a lie – witness the hour by hourmendacity of the ‘Covid’ era. Why would this Cult-ownedcombination which has unleashed lies like machine gun firesuddenly ‘agree’ to tell the truth??Much of the alternative media is buying the lie because it fits theconspiracy narrative, but it’s the wrong conspiracy. The realconspiracy is that there is no virus and that is what the Cult isdesperate to hide. The idea that the ‘virus’ was released by accidentis ludicrous when the whole ‘Covid’ hoax was clearly long-plannedand waiting to be played out as it was so fast in accordance with theRockefeller document and Event 201. So they prepared everything indetail over decades and then sat around strumming their fingerswaiting for an ‘accidental’ release from a bio-lab? What?? It’s crazy.Then there’s the ‘on purpose’ claim.

India becamethe new Italy in the ‘Covid’ propaganda campaign and we were toldto be frightened of the new ‘Indian strain’. Somehow I couldn’t findit within myself to do so. A document produced for the UKgovernment entitled ‘Summary of further modelling of easing ofrestrictions – Roadmap Step 2’ declared that a third wave wasinevitable (of course when it’s in the script) and it would be the faultof children and those who refuse the health-destroying fake ‘Covidvaccine’.

Thedocument states that both models presumed extremely high uptake"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"of the ‘Covid vaccines’ and didn’t allow for ‘variants’. The documentstates: ‘The resurgence is a result of some people (mostly children)being ineligible for vaccination; others choosing not to receive thevaccine; and others being vaccinated but not perfectly protected.’The mendacity takes the breath away. Okay, blame those with abrain who won’t take the DNA-modifying shots and put morepressure on children to have it as ‘trials’ were underway involvingchildren as young as six months with parents who give insanity abad name. Massive pressure is being put on the young to have thefake ‘vaccine’ and child age consent limits have been systematicallylowered around the world to stop parents intervening. Mostextraordinary about the document was its claim that the ‘third wave’would be driven by ‘the resurgence in both hospitalisations anddeaths ... dominated by those that have received two doses of the vaccine,comprising around 60-70% of the wave respectively’. The predictedpeak of the ‘third wave’ suggested 300 deaths per day with 250 ofthem fully ‘vaccinated’ people. How many more lies do acquiescersneed to be told before they see the obvious? Those who took the jabto ‘protect themselves’ are projected to be those who mostly get sickand die? So what’s in the ‘vaccine’? The document went on:It is possible that a summer of low prevalence could be followed by substantial increases inincidence over the following autumn and winter. Low prevalence in late summer should notbe taken as an indication that SARS-CoV-2 has retreated or that the population has highenough levels of immunity to prevent another wave.They are telling you the script and while many British peoplebelieved ‘Covid’ restrictions would end in the summer of 2021 thegovernment was preparing for them to be ongoing. Authorities wereawarding contracts for ‘Covid marshals’ to police the restrictionswith contracts starting in July, 2021, and going through to January31st, 2022, and the government was advertising for ‘Media BuyingServices’ to secure media propaganda slots worth a potential £320million for ‘Covid-19 campaigns’ with a contract not ending untilMarch, 2022.

Instead the Nappies choosesituations away from the mass crowds to target, intimidate, and seekto promote the impression of ‘violent protestors’. One such incidenthappened in London’s Hyde Park. Hundreds of thousands walkingthrough the streets in protest against ‘Covid’ fascism were ignoredby the Cult-owned BBC and most of the rest of the mainstreammedia, but they delighted in reporting how police were injured in‘clashes with protestors’. The truth was that a group of peoplegathered in Hyde Park at the end of one march when most had gonehome and they were peacefully having a good time with music andchat. Face-Nappies who couldn’t deal with the full-march crowdthen waded in with their batons and got more than they bargainedfor.

Unfortunately two orthree idiots in the crowd threw drink cans striking two officerswhich gave the media and the government the image they wanted todiscredit the 99.9999 percent who were peaceful.

However, using the abovedefinition, common sense, the laws of logic and the dictates ofscience, any unbiased person must come to the conclusion that theSARS-CoV-2 virus has never been isolated or purified. As a result, noconfirmation of the virus’ existence can be found. The logical,common sense, and scientific consequences of this fact are: the structure and composition of something not shown to existcan’t be known, including the presence, structure, and function ofany hypothetical spike or other proteins;the genetic sequence of something that has never been found can’tbe known;“variants” of something that hasn’t been shown to exist can’t beknown;it’s impossible to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a diseasecalled Covid-19."},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"12 In as concise terms as possible, here’s the proper way to isolate,characterize and demonstrate a new virus. First, one takes samples(blood, sputum, secretions) from many people (e.g. 500) withsymptoms which are unique and specific enough to characterize anillness. Without mixing these samples with ANY tissue or productsthat also contain genetic material, the virologist macerates, filtersand ultracentrifuges i.e. purifies the specimen. This common virologytechnique, done for decades to isolate bacteriophages1 and so-calledgiant viruses in every virology lab, then allows the virologist todemonstrate with electron microscopy thousands of identically sizedand shaped particles. These particles are the isolated and purifiedvirus.These identical particles are then checked for uniformity byphysical and/or microscopic techniques. Once the purity isdetermined, the particles may be further characterized. This wouldinclude examining the structure, morphology, and chemicalcomposition of the particles. Next, their genetic makeup ischaracterized by extracting the genetic material directly from thepurified particles and using genetic-sequencing techniques, such asSanger sequencing, that have also been around for decades. Thenone does an analysis to confirm that these uniform particles areexogenous (outside) in origin as a virus is conceptualized to be, andnot the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues.2 (Asof May 2020, we know that virologists have no way to determinewhether the particles they’re seeing are viruses or just normal break-down products of dead and dying tissues.)3 Isolation, characterization and analysis of bacteriophages from the haloalkaline lake Elmenteita,KenyaJuliah Khayeli Akhwale et al, PLOS One, Published: April 25, 2019.https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215734 – accessed 2/15/21“Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Apoptotic Cells: An Essential Link Between Death andRegeneration,” Maojiao Li1 et al, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2020 October 2.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.573511/full – accessed 2/15/21"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"3“The Role of Extraellular Vesicles as Allies of HIV, HCV and SARS Viruses,” Flavia Giannessi, et al,Viruses, 2020 May If we have come this far then we have fully isolated, characterized,and genetically sequenced an exogenous virus particle. However, westill have to show it is causally related to a disease. This is carriedout by exposing a group of healthy subjects (animals are usuallyused) to this isolated, purified virus in the manner in which thedisease is thought to be transmi\u0000ed. If the animals get sick with thesame disease, as confirmed by clinical and autopsy findings, one hasnow shown that the virus actually causes a disease. Thisdemonstrates infectivity and transmission of an infectious agent.None of these steps has even been a\u0000empted with the SARS-CoV-2virus, nor have all these steps been successfully performed for anyso-called pathogenic virus. Our research indicates that a single studyshowing these steps does not exist in the medical literature.Instead, since 1954, virologists have taken unpurified samplesfrom a relatively few people, o\u0000en less than ten, with a similardisease. They then minimally process this sample and inoculate thisunpurified sample onto tissue culture containing usually four to sixother types of material – all of which contain identical geneticmaterial as to what is called a “virus.” The tissue culture is starvedand poisoned and naturally disintegrates into many types ofparticles, some of which contain genetic material. Against allcommon sense, logic, use of the English language and scientificintegrity, this process is called “virus isolation.” This brewcontaining fragments of genetic material from many sources is thensubjected to genetic analysis, which then creates in a computer-simulation process the alleged sequence of the alleged virus, a socalled in silico genome. At no time is an actual virus confirmed byelectron microscopy. At no time is a genome extracted andsequenced from an actual virus. This is scientific fraud."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"The observation that the unpurified specimen — inoculated ontotissue culture along with toxic antibiotics, bovine fetal tissue,amniotic fluid and other tissues — destroys the kidney tissue ontowhich it is inoculated is given as evidence of the virus’ existence andpathogenicity. This is scientific fraud.From now on, when anyone gives you a paper that suggests theSARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated, please check the methodssections. If the researchers used Vero cells or any other culturemethod, you know that their process was not isolation. You will hearthe following excuses for why actual isolation isn’t done:1. There were not enough virus particles found in samples from patients to analyze.2. Viruses are intracellular parasites; they can’t be found outside the cell in this manner.If No. 1 is correct, and we can’t find the virus in the sputum of sickpeople, then on what evidence do we think the virus is dangerous oreven lethal? If No. 2 is correct, then how is the virus spread fromperson to person? We are told it emerges from the cell to infectothers. Then why isn’t it possible to find it?Finally, questioning these virology techniques and conclusions isnot some distraction or divisive issue. Shining the light on this truthis essential to stop this terrible fraud that humanity is confronting.For, as we now know, if the virus has never been isolated, sequencedor shown to cause illness, if the virus is imaginary, then why are wewearing masks, social distancing and pu\u0000ing the whole world intoprison?Finally, if pathogenic viruses don’t exist, then what is going intothose injectable devices erroneously called “vaccines,” and what istheir purpose?
