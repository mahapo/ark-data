Birth Certificates and Naturalization papers, Green Cards, etc., are private documents presented to the Recording Secretaries for verification purposes and are not published. Apart from this one function -- issuing State Credential Cards -- an Assembly Recording Secretary is not generally enabled nor empowered to comment on the correctness or efficacy of a recording --- that is entirely the responsibility of the people establishing the record and the Recording Secretary bears no responsibility or liability beyond establishing and keeping the Public Record intact. When people wish to become official members of their State Assembly, they need to present (or create) the Public Record that they are Americans, born o r naturalized in this country, and affirm that they are adopting State National and/or State Citizen political status. They also need to affirm that they have a permanent home in the State and have lived in the State for at least one year. That's it. ” – A rticle 3305 For The State Recording Secretaries by Anna Von Reitz "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"V ERIFYING I DENTITY Acceptable Forms of ID: Birth Certificate, Naturalization paperwork, or other documentation like written birth recordings or bible entries with name and date and place establishing where they were born and who they are for assembly record and picture ID like a driver’s license, assembly card, passport, school ID with picture, etc. Common Sense: A nna talks a lot about engaging our shinola sensors.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" THE 1779 D ECLARATION AKA THE ONE PAGER What is it? In July of 1779 the Founders faced a problem: how to identify Americans versus Brits and Dutch and Swedes and other nationalities living here in this country? The 1779 Naturalization Act was the answer. It’s a very simple re quirement by which our Forefathers identified themselves as Americans and not Brits, not French, not Dutch.... or any of the other options that were available in Colonial America. We have been facing a similar problem today, in that our Federal Subcontractor s have proliferated and promoted their citizenship(s) as separate political statuses, and have created False Registrations as Territorial U.S. Citizens and as Municipal “citizens of the United States” in our names without our knowledge or consent. Once aga in, we need to declare our political status as Americans. So, we use The 1779 Naturalization Act and we provide some necessary updates by which Americans, both those born within the physical borders of the States, and those who have been Naturalized as Uni ted States Citizens, may establish and/or re - verify their political status via recording their Declarations with their State Assemblies. How to Handle this Document Currently, there ar e five template versions for this document based on status : For Americans born within the physical boarders of America, Green Card Immigrants, seven year undocumented Immigrants, Naturalized Americans, and Federal Employees.

The two witness testimonies are more recent and therefore superior evidence that the American State National is who he says he is. The two affirmed Witness Testimonies are to be from people ideally having first hand knowledge of who the American State National is (friends, family, classmates, long time employers, coworkers, etc.) and where and when they were born, clearly identifying a picture of the American State National as \"the\" one who was born at such and such a time and place to such parents. The witnesses that sign the document should have known the American State National for at least seven years if they don’t have first hand knowledge of where and when they were born.

This document establishes that you willingly expatriate your names from any and all Federal Territorial and Municipal citizenship obligations and duties and return to your birthright political status. This declares that you are not voluntarily acting in any capacity as a federal employee or dependent or franchisee. There will be one Act for each version of your names that you have ever used. Example: If your birth name is John Mark Doe, you will have one Act for JOHN MARK DOE, JOHN M. DOE, JOHN DOE. If you have gone by any other names (i.e. married names, name changes etc) you will have t he same three versions for EACH NAME. Example: Birth name is Jane Ma rie Doe, you will have one Act for JANE MA RIE DOE, JANE M. DOE, JANE DOE . A dditionally , If your m arried name is Jane Marie Smith, you will have one Act for JANE MARIE SMITH, JANE M. SMITH , JANE SMITH for a total of six Acts. If a woman was married 2 times she will have a total of nine Acts. If you a man or woman does not have a middle name, they will only have one Act. If they have more than one middle name, they can have a lot more Acts. It’s not the Recording Secretaries’ job to verify they have the right number of Acts signed but rather, to simply witness that they sign it matching the name in the document.
