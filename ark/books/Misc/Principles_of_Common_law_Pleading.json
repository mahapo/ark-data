THE principles of common-law pleading as they came into our law are \",\"orthy of special study. They con-stitute a subject of interest and importance alike to the lawyer who practices under a modern code system, and to him whose professional activity lies in some State where the old forms, though modified somewhat it may be by occasional statutory enactment or progressive court decision, still prevail. No code has been able to abolish the principles of common-law pleading because they form the foundation upon which every code must build its own system. A code may call things by different names -as complaint for declaration, answer for plea -but the things re-main the same, and, what is more to the point, the pur-pose for which the thing is used remains the same. Hence to know how to best make the thing serve its purpose one may still study with profit its origin and its use in the cases recorded in the home of its origin. It is in fact the same with Pleading as with other subjects. Our whole system of law is the embodiment of the principles of the common law as found in the cases, and to the cases we must ever turn for .light either as a direct aid to the administration of justice or as a means of understanding and applying some statutory restatement of principles first established by th~ cou~.

Such enactment has perhaps ambitiously sought to simplify a principle of law by encasing it in exact lan-guage, but alas, has only succeeded in adding to the labor of application the task of interpretation, thus increasing the chance of error. In a democracy such as ours the people are the source of the law, which evolves through the slow process of the decisions of courts and the more rapid process of the enactments of legislatures. When such enactments are confineq to the prescribing of new, or the modify-ing of old rules relating to property or persons, they record and reflect the current state of society and thus serve a ve~y useful purpose; but when they attempt to crystallize into a set form all existing rules governing property and person they merely complicate the situa-tion, to the consternation of the lawyer who now finds himself removed one step further from the enlightening sources of the law and is compelled to take his light, as it were, from the original sources through a statutory screen, not always, be it said, of the clearest trans-mitting material. From the earliest beginnings down to the time when our several\" States, with their separate and differing judicial systems, began to adapt and fit the common law to their respective needs we may study the system of pleading in its development through the cases and the English statutes, with the feeling that our knowl-edge thus acquired will be an asset of value in any jurisdiction. To such study the student must add, in order to complete his equipment, a further study of cases and, Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":":PREFACE •. statutes in the particular jurisdiction where he intends to practice. It is not the aim of this treatise to carry the student beyond an understanding of the main principles of com-mon-law pleading as they came to us in the beginning, and, except by way of illustration where original prin-Ciples have been reasserted by modem decisions, little reference is made to modern cases. The subject of common-law pleading has been treated fully, and in great detail, by Chitty. Other text writers, chief among them Stephen, have treated it less in detail, but more clearly. The works of all of these writers, however, are characterized by a greater fulness than is necessary, or even con-venient, for the purposes of the student who expects to practice in this country.. What seems to be required is a summary of the main principles of the subject-the principles whose influence is still felt in the various systems of pleading which prevail in the different States, without the mass of technical and local rules which encumbered the old English system. It is this need which the present work is intended, in some small measure, to meet. The late Professor Ames, of the Harvard Law School, prepared, some years ago, a collection of cases upon the subject, which has been and is used in many Law Schools with satisfactory results. The selection and arrangement of the cases by Professor Ames has been so judicious and effective, and the use of a book, such as his collection of cases, so desirable in connec-tion with a text-book, that I have, in the order of treat-ment of the principles covered by his cases, followed Digitized by Goog I e"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"vi :PREFACE. in the main his arrangement and adopted the cases selected by him as illustrations. This matter is con-tained in Part II. Part I. contains a brief explanation of the different forms of actions, to which the principles set forth in Part II. mainly relate. I know, in my own case, some explanation of this nature would have been a great help to a proper understanding of the cases. If the explanation given shall prove of assistance to any one else, it will have accomplished its purpose. In conclusion, I wish to say that the present work is put forth only as a guide to the main principles of the subject of civil pleading and a help to the under-standing of the cases which illustrate those principles, and in no sense as a complete treatise on the subject. Illustrations taken from the cases have been used to show the application of the principles set forth, and have been referenced for convenience both to Ames' Cases, where contained therein, and to the original reports.

The principles of pleading are the rules which, in the development of the law of procedure in actions, have become established with reference to the form in which the parties shall state their respective ver-. sions of the matter in dispute between them, and with respect to the manner in which, and means by which, either party may take advantage of a failure on the part of the other to properly formulate his statements. One may learn a rule of pleading, such as t:\\:lat a denial must not be made of an immaterial allegation, 1 As early as 1677 we find\" Pleadings\" defined as including • the \"count\" or declaration as well as to the subsequent state-ments of the parties.-Ever, Doc'rifta PlGcitGfldi, Preface. . -.-Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"2 PRINCIPLES OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING. but to apply the rule one~q.ust know what is an im-material allegation.

It is the plaintiff in the action who determines the form which the action shall take: he does it by the first pleading in the action, known as the d6cla-ration, a formal statement to the court of the facts upon which he deems he has the right to invoke the aid of the court against the defendant. He must take the responsibility of determining whether he has a cause of action, what relief he is entitled to, and what form of action will fit the case. The proper determination of these questions is im-portant to the plaintiff in drawing his declaration. A proper determination of the same questions is im-portant to the defendant in deciding what steps to take in reference to the declaration. The declaration will be sufficient if it states a valid cause of action in the form which will give the plaintiff the relief to which the facts entitle him. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"IlfTRODUCTORT. 3 § 4. To determine whether or not the declaration in any given action, viewed in this light as a statement' of the plaintiff's case, is sufficient, obviously requires something besides a knowledge of the principles of pleading. That something is a general knowledge of the rights and obligations of the individual as a member of civilized society subject to the common law, and of the different forms of action in which such rights and obligations are enforced. A study of the principles of pleading will not teach when a declaration is insuf-ficient as a statement of the plaintiff's case, but only how to bring the matter before the court for action, if from his knowledge of substantive law the pleader has determined that the declaration is insufficient. § 5. It often happens that the student takes up the study of common-law pleading before he has be-come familiar with the different branches of substantive law and the various forms of action which have arisen under the common-law system. It is perhaps neces-sary that this should be so, inasmuch as some knowl-edge of the different pleadings and their offices is es-sential to a· proper understanding of the cases which are the main sources of the substantive law. It is there-fore with a view to helping the student to more read-ily grasp the principles which govern the decisions of the various questions of pleading arising in the reported cases, that an explanation of the different forms of action, and of the necessary allegations in the declara-tions of each, is here introduced. The aim has been to present the matter in the briefest form consistent with clearness. The subject of the declaration in each form.

One may justly inquire before entering upon a study of the several forms of common-law actions referred to, wherein a knowledge of the distinction between the several forms will aid in modern practice. The answer is that whatever form for the statement of his position modem statutory regulations may have imposed upon the party who, as plaintiff or defendant, seeks the aid of the Courts, the principles underlying the relief to which he is entitled must often be sought directly in cases which have \"wended their toilsOme way through the Courts by means of the old common-law forms.\" And even when the principles involved have been restated in statutory law it is more than likely the old cases will be resorted to for the purpose determining the prop~r meaning or application of the statutory provisions. Hence as there can be no escape from a resort to the cases, it is clear that they will be better understood and interpreted if there be a famil-iarity with the different forms in which they were cast. § 7. The different forms of action were the out-growth of the many and varied states of facts pre-sented to courts by plaintiffs seeking redress against defendants. It became a convenience to designate similar causes of action -i. e., causes of action where the plaintiffs based their rights to relief upon the same theory -by the same name. The result was a number of classes of actions, each with its separate name and Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTORY. 5 form of statement, in which classes were included all of the ordinary cases arising between litigants. But with the development of the law and the broadening of the field of actionable wrongs, cases were frequently presented which could not be brought within anyone of the established classes of actions and yet the plain-tiffs were clearly entitled to relief. The plaintiffs were therefore permitted to state the fac~ and demand the relief to which they deemed they were entitled, and these actions were termed \"Actions on the Case,\" or \"Actions of Trespas8 on the Case.\" Later they became a class by themselves, known as U Case,\" and an action was spoken of as being brought in Case, jllst as in Trespass or in Debt. § 8.

It is interesting to note that there is a great difference in the statutory systems which have in most States superseded the old common-law classification of ac-tions. Where in one an attempt will be made to pre-serve the distinctions, as in Alabama,l in another, as :'Alabama Code, 1907, § 5382 et Bet[. The statute even pre-Icribes the forms for the complaint (same as deoiaratiOtl) in the several forms of action and subdivides both contract and tort action8 into many different classes.

Before noticing separately the different forms of action and the declaration in each, it may be of assistance to call attention to an elementary principle upon which is based the theory of recovery in all actions alike. It is this: that to have a cause of action you must have (1) a right, (2) ~ wrong, i. e., a violation of the right. The most ancient and best definition of an action has been said to be that of the Mirror, \"An action is nothing else but a lawful demand of right.\" 2 The natural classification of actions is accordingly that which rests upon a distinction between the rights sought to be redressed. It is this principle of classifi-cation which the author has adopted, and pursuant to it has divided the ten forms of action above given into two general divisions: (1) those based on acquired rights, treated of in Chapter II.; (2) those based on natural rights, treated of in Chapter III. §. 10. Actions are commonly divided, with respect to their subject-matter, into three classes, Real, Per-1 Revised Statutes of Arizona, § 425. \"The complaint shall set forth clearly the names of the parties, a concise statement of the cause of action, without any distinction between suits at law and in equity and shll also state the nature of the relief which he demands.\" . 2 Mirror of Justices, ch.

Per80nal actions are those in which damages are sought for injuries to the person, to personal prop-erty, or to real property, or in which the specific recov-ery of personal property is sought. Mixed actions are those in which the specific recovery of real property is sought, together with damages. Except from an historical point of view, a study of the old common-law real actions would be of little value, as they have long since ceased to be used, and there are no principles connected with them wh~ch have survived to influence the modern forms of procedure. The old writs of right, entry, formedon, and dower were the most common of these real actions. The distinction between personal actions and mixed actions is of no importance; at the same time it is well to understand the meaning of the terms, as they are frequently met with. It will be seen by referring to the explanation of the objects of the various forms of action treated of, that all of them except the action of ejectment belong to the class known as per80nal actions. There is no applicability in the term, as.they relate ex-clusively neither to personal property nor to the person. § 11. In all forms of action it is the office of the declaration to state the cause of a~tion. This neces-sarily involves a statement of the right and of the wrong. To show that the cause of action belongs to the plaintiff it must appear that the right is the plain-tiff's, and that the wrong by the defendant is a violation of that particular right.

Any other rules must relate only to matter of - form. If this simple principle -so simple and ele-mentary that it seems to scarcely need stating -be kept in mind, it will aid very materially to fix in the mind the rules relating to the declarations in the different forms of action, and to make them easy of application in any given case. § 12. There were many technical rules, sometimes local to a particular court, and many of which are ob-solete, which relate to different parta of the declara-tion, especially to the beginnings and endings. As these rules have nothing to do with the main principles of pleading, a statement of them could be of no value to the student, and might tend to confuse the subject. They are therefore omitted. § 13. While it is not the purpose of the author to make the present work in any sense a book of forms, it may be helpful to set forth in full one example of a declaration (as well as of each of the other pleadings as they are taken up), in order to call attention to the different parts, and to distinguish between that which is merely formal and that which constitutes the sub-stance of the declaration. .

The best illustration of this perhaps was in the case of an executor or adminis-trator suing in his representative capacity.

Of the ten forms of common-law actions men-tioned in the preceding chapter, the first five,-Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, and General Assumpsit,-in one sense form a group by themselves as distinguished from the last five forms: Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case, and Ejectment. The wrongs which are redressed in the former class of actions are those which are violations of special rights,-rights which exist because of special relations into which the parties have entered. § 17. The basis of the action of Debt is the viola-tion, by the defendant of a right which exists because the plaintiff and defendant have placed themselves, by their acts, in the special relation of debtor and· creditor.

In Detinue this feature is not quite so ap-parent; in fact, the tendency has been to class the action with that of Trover, and to treat the detaining in the former action as a tortious act similar to the converting in the latter. It is conceived that the true theory of the action of detinue is that the detention is the violation of a special or acquired right. For, while it is true that one person has the natural right not to have his property interfered with by another, and t}:tat wrongful detention is an interference which would be a violation of this right, yet, viewed in this light, the wrongful act furnishes ground for an action of Trover, and not of Detinue.1 The same act may f~rnish grounds for an action of Detinue, but not unless it is viewed in another light, namely, as a det~ntion of property which the defend-ant is under an obligation to deliver to the plaintiff, or, in other words, a failure to perform a special obli-gation,-a violation of a special right, which the plain-tiff has acquired, not by reason of his simple ownership of the property, but by reason of the fact that there is a special relation between himself and the defendant, such as a bailment. The plaintiff owning or having the general right to the property which is lawfully in defendant's possession, has asserted that right in such a way -e. g., by demand -as to acquire a special 1 Kettle v.

Hence the judgment in the action of Detinue is, in the alternative, for the recovery of the property or its value. The special obligation to deliver the property, similar to an obligation based on a promise and arising because of the special relation of the parties, is thus recognized and enforced. In fact, the a.ction of Detinue has been brought upon a contract to deliver a specific chattel.l It seems clear, therefore, that Detinue is properly classed with the actions of Debt, Covenant, and Assumpsit.2 § 20. In Assumpsit, both Special and General, the right and corresponding obligation which form the basis of the action are clearly personal to the particu-lar parties to the contract or. transaction which gives rise to such right and obligation. 1 Fitzherbert, Natura Brevium, p. 138. II These forms of action are generally distinguiehed by the term actions etJJ contractu, as distinguished from the actions known as etJJ delictu, on the theory that the former are brought upon con-tract and the latter for a tort or wrong. The terms, however, are not strictly applicable, as the idea of contract in its usually understood sense does not necessarily enter into the action of Debt or that of Detinue, both of said actions many times being founded upon obligations arising from special relations between the parties other than contractual. Furtber, to say that an action ill for a wrong does not distinguish it, a8 every action is for a wrong. The writer 8ubmits that the true basis of the distinction which undoubtedly does exist is that the one class of actions is for 'wrongs which are violations of original or natural rights,-rights which beloDg to one person as against all others; while the other class is for wrongs which are violations of special or acquired righ.ts,-rightll which one person has agailll't some Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"14 PRINCIPLES OF COlLMON-LAW FLEADING. SECTION II.-DEBT. § 21. Debt is one of the earliest actions known to the law.1 It is based upon the theory that the defend-ant has something, usually a sum of money, which he is under obligation to deliver to the plaintiff by reason of something having been done by or between the par-ties which has caused the obligation to arise, and that, being under such obligation, the defendant detains this something, known as the debt. The plaintiff may have given the defendant goods in return for which the debt is due, or the defendant may have executed a bond under the terms of which the debt has arisen. What-ever the facts may be, the plaintiff in the action of debt is suing to recover something due to him, which the defendant should, but will not, deliver to him.2 Deten-tion is the essence of the action of Debt, as it is of the aotion of Detinue,3 but in the former case it is the detention of something the title to which has not yet passed to the plaintiff, while in the latter it is the detention of a specific thing to which the plaintiff other particular person or perllODS who have come into some special relation with him. , lIvo de Stokes 11.

In the common-law declarations ·in Debt this theory of the wrongful detention, by the defendant, of something belonging to the plaintiff, is followed to its logical conclusion by the demand for damages for the detention of the debt. 1 The sum de-manded as damages was nominal, but it illustrates clearly the theory of the action. § 22. To show a good cause of action in Debt the declaration should contain, in accordance with the principle heretofore laid down: (a) A statement of the right on the part of the plaintiff; (b) A statement of the wrong or violation of the right by the defendant. But the very idea of debt implies a right on the part of the plaintiff and a violation of the right by non-payment of the debt. If a debt is shown to exist, a prima facie cause of action is shown. It happens, therefore, that in this form of action the right and the wrong are stated together in the statement of the facts which show the debt to exist. § 23. As the action of Debt is a very broad one, the statement of facts will differ with the varying. character of the circumstances which have given rise 1 Referring to the declaration in an action of Debt, we read: .. although often required had not rendered the said 160l to the said Mary • • • and unjustly detained the same, where-fore she then said she was worEe and hail damage to the l1alue of 20 l,\" and then we find \"it was then considered by the Court that the said Mary should recover against the said Richard her said debt and her damage on occasion of the detention of that debt to lIixty shillings.\" Hancocke 11.

To enumerate the many different cases of debt would be beyond the scope of the present chap-ter. A few words, however, in reference to the most common instances of the action may be helpful. § 24. Debt on Simple Contract. We frequently find cases designated in the reports as U Debt on simple contract.\" This means that the form of the action is in Debt, and that there has been a contract, oral or written, and express or implied, but not under seal, between the parties, which has created the debt. -An action to recover money lent by the plaintiff to the defendant; money paid to the defendant's use; money had and received by the de-fendant to the plaintiff's use; for the price of goods sold and delivered, or of work, labor, and. services, if brought in Debt, is included in the particular class known as Debt on simple contract. Actions in debt for money lent, money had and received, etc., must not be confounded with what are known as the common counts for money lent, money had and received, etc. The latter belong to the class of actions called General Assumpsit and will be noticed hereafter.1 \\ Vaux 11.

The statement of the facts required in a declaration consists of the statement of this act on the part of the plaintiff, whether it be the performance of some service at the request of the defendant, the selling of goods, the loaning of money, or anyone of the numerous other things which may have caused the debt. . § 25, Debt on. Specialties. An obligation to pay a sum of money -i. e., a debt - could be created by a bond· or other agreement under seal. Such a sealed instrument was known as a Specialty. In such a case a statement of the facts causing the debt included simply a statement of the existence of the bond or other instrument upon which the debt was founded. The debt arose from an act on the part of the defendant. He himself created the debt by his execution of the instrument out of which it arose. § 26. Debt on. Records. An obligation to pay a sum of money might be created independently of any action of the parties, as if it was sold for more or lesll, yet the plaintiff shall recover what it was sold for; but if debt be brought on that contract, if it come out to be more or less, the plaintiff cannot recover, for it is a. praecipe quod reddat (so much money in particular).\" 2 Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"18 PRINCIPLES OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING. by a judgment of the court. The manner of its crea-tion was immaterial, however; if it was an obligation . to pay a sum of money, it was a debt and recoverable in the action of Debt. Hence, we have the class of debt actions known as Debt on Records. Here the statement of facts consisted of a statement of the judg-ment with sufficient detail to connect the defendant with the plaintiff in respect to the liability on the same. § 27. Debt on Statutes. Sometimes a statute imposed a penalty and a de-fendant found himself subject thereto. Again, the action of Debt was applicable, as the penalty was an obligation to pay a sum of money, and hence a debt. Here it was necessary to refer to the statute which was relied upon and to state the facts which showed the defendant to have violated the same and to have made himself subject to the penalty. § 28. In spite of the fact that a statement of the facts in debt is a statement both of the right and the wrong, we find the rule frequently laid down that the declaration should contain a statement of the breach or refusal to pay the debt. The reason of this rule is riot quite clear, as when sufficient facts have been alleged in the declaration to show that there isa debt, a prima facie cause of action has been made out. The legal meaning of thE'! word debt is something due, something which should be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff; given the debt, and a prima facie cause of action exists to recover it. It was, however, customary to allege a refusal on the part Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ACTIONS BASED ON ACQUIRED RIGHTS. 19 of the defendant to pay the debt.1 The case of Good-child\" v. Pledge 2 seems to show that the statement of the breach was a mere matter of form, and that it was not necessary to the substantial validity of the declaration. SECTION III.-DETINUE. § 29. The action of Detinue was in respect to chat-tels what the action of debt was in respect to money. In debt a recovery of the sum of money due was the main object of the action. In detinue recovery of a specific chattel was the main object. The action of detinue was, perhaps, as early a crystallization of the common law as that of debt. At all events we find it 1 See note, ante, p. 14. 21 M. & W. 363. Ames, Cases on Pleading, 37. The action was in Debt for £20 for goods sold and delivered. The second plea was that when the said sum of £20 became due and payable the defendant paid it. This plea concluded to the country, i. e., requested a .determination of the matter by the jury. The rule required a plea containing new matter to conclude with a veri-fication (post, p. 103). By\"a special demurrer the question whether or not the plea should have ended with a verification, and hence whether or not it contained new affirmative matter, was raised. It was contended by counsel that the plea amounted to a denial of the refusal to pay, i. e., the breach, and, therefore, properly concluded to the country. Baron Parke says: \"Is the statement of the breach in debt anything more than a mere form? The moment the goods are delivered, is there not a cause of action, throwing the proof of its discharge on the defendant? If the breach is mere form, you cannot traverl!e it; then your plea is in discharge and ought to conclude with a verification.\" Again he says: \"I think it will be found on looking into the cases that a statement of the breach is ml're form; if so, the plea admits the debt and is a plea in confession and avoidance.\" Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"20 PRINCIPLES OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING. among the very earliest reported cases. 1 So identical were the two actions in the theory upon which recovery was allowed that they were frequently joined, and we have declarations which seek a recovery of a debt for goods sold and delivered, or in the event that the facts do not warrant the conclusion that there was a sale, then a recovery of the specific goods on the ground that the defendant is wrongfully detaining them.2 § 30. In the action of Detinue the plaintiff recov-ered the specific chattels, or in the event they could not be returned, their value, together with damages for their detention. § 31. To show a good cause of action it is neces-sary for the declaration to contain: (a). A statement of the plaintiff's right. The chattels should be described with sufficient certainty for identification and their value be stated; it should be alleged that they belong to the plaintiff, that the defendant has possession of the chattels and acquired it lawfully, as by finding or bailment, but holds it subject to the plaintiff's superior right to im-mediate possession which has been asserted by a de-mand.3 The facts will always show some special relation between the plaintiff and the defendant, such as that of bailor and bailee, by which the defendant has had, or is assumed to have had, a lawful posses-1 Maltravers 11.

The object of the allegation of value is that, in case the goods themselves cannot be returned, judgment may be rendered for their value. (b). A statement of the wrong, or breach on the part of the defendant. Having shown the plaintiff's right to the possession of the goods, the declaration should allege the wrong-ful act on the part of the defendant upon which the action is based,-i. e., his refusal to deliver the chattels to the plaintiff. SECTION IV.-COVENANT. § 32. The action of Covenant is what its name im-plies, an action based upon a covenant, or proimse under seal. The object of the action is to recover damages for breach of the covenant. The action is an exceedingly old one; it existed long before the action of assumpsit was allowed, and illustrates the importance which the· early law attached to a sealed instrument. With the growth of the modem action of assumpsit, the· idea of the importance of the seal disappeared and that of consideration took its place. The early idea, under which recovery was allowed for a breach of a promise, seems to have been that of un-doubted intention on the part of the promisor to as-sume the liability, shown by his solemnly and delib-erately putting the ~tamp of his individuality upon it Digitized by Coogle •"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"22 PRINCIPLES OF COMMO~-LAW PLEADING. in the shape of his seal. The covenantor was liable, not because it was just that he should be liable, or because the covenantee had parted with anything on the faith of the covenant, but because he had delib-erately, by his sealed writing, announced that he held himself liable. In the transition from this view of a promisor's liability to that which looks upon the con-sideration as the determining factor, it was sought to graft the idea of consideration upon the theory of recovery upon a scaled instrument, and the rule, or so-called presumption of law, was established, that in the case of a sealed instrument consideration would be conclusively presumed. The real fact of the matter was that there were two distinct grounds for holding a promisor liable upon his promise, either one of which was sufficient. One, and the earlier, because he delib-erately intended to make himself liable and so indicated by the solemnity of the seal; the other, because he had received a consideration which it would be unjust to the promisee to allow him to keep unless he was held liable upon his promise. § 33. To show a good cause of action in Covenant, it is necessary for the declaration to contain: {a). A statement of the plaintiff's right. In this form of action the right of the plaintiff is shown by a statement of two things. (1). A statement of the covenant. It is necessary to set forth either the whole instrument or that part of it which contains the covenant for breach of which damage~ are sought, being careful to allege that the Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ACTIONS BASED ON ACQUIRED RIGHTS. 23 instrument is under 8eal.1 The covenant is the basis of the special relation betwee~ the parties out of which the plaintiff's right arises. (2). A statement of the performance or happening of any conditions precedent to the defendant's covenant. If the covenant is not conditional, then performance by the plaintiff need not be alleged, as consideration is no part of the theory of recovery.2 (b). A statement of the breach, or non-performance, on the part of the defendant. SECTION V.-SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT. § 34. An action for breach of a contract not under seal was known, when it first came into use, as a species of an action on the case, \"being an action of modern invention, to get rid of the law wager.\" 3 Later it was separated from that general class of actions and formed a class by itself under the name of Special A88umpsit. § 35. The recovery in this form of action is upon a promise; the basis of the plaintiff's right and the 1 Moore 11. Jones, 2 Ld.

Unless a consideration is alleged and proved, the action must fail.1 § 36. The contract for breach of which a recovery is sought, may be in express terms and either oral or in writing, or may be implied from the acts of the parties,-i. e., implied in fact.

This com-prises a statement of a promise on the defendant's part and a consideration therefor, which may be either an act or a promiae on the plaintiff's part. If the consideration for the defendant's promise is an act on the plaintiff's part, such as the doing of some. work or the delivering of some property, i. e., if the contract· is a unilaterall one, the performance of the consideration must be alleged, for performance is an essential part of the contract. Until the petformance takes place there is no contract. If, however, the consideration for the defendant's promise is another promise on the plaintiff's part, i. e., the contract is a bilateral 2 one, then, to state a valid contract, all that need be alleged in the way of consid-eration is the making of the promise by the plaintiff, and not the performance of that which is promised.3 1 This term has been very aptly applied to contracts of this character by ProfeBlOr LangdeU in his work on contracts. It is unilateral or one-sided, in the sense that before it exists at all 811 a cOft,tract, performance on the other side must be complete, &I it i. thia very performance that converts it from a mere offer into a binding promise or contract. A& a COfttract, therefore, it binds only one party, the other having already performed.

The performance by the plaintiff of his promise may or may not be conditional to performance by the de-fendant. If it is, such performance must be alleged. Some other act on the part of the plaintiff, which he is not bound by his promise to perform, may be made by the contract a condition precedent to the defendant's promise. In such case performance of such act must be alleged. The defenda~t's promise may be condi-tional upon the happening of some event, or the doing of something by some third party. If so, the happen-ing of the event or the doing of the act must be alleged. In short, after the statement of the contract, such facts must be alleged as will show that the plaintiff is not in fault and that the duty of perform1!.nce rests on the defendant. (b).

The theory of recovery in the fol'IIlS of ac-tion classed under the head of General Assumpsit is the same as that in Special Assumpsit, namely, dam-ages for breach of a promise. The promise, however, is a fictitious one. No real promise exists. As every promise to be binding. must have a consideration, the consideration was found for this fictitious promise in the existence of the debt. It was, therefore, neither a real promise nor a real consideration; only a form which was seized upon to allow recovery in certain cases where it was not desired to use the action of Debt. Wherever there was a debt the courts acted upon the theory that there was a promise to pay a sum of money equal to the debt, for breach of which an action could be maintained. § 39. The several varieties, or counts, as they were known, of General Assumpsit, have been vari-ously classified at different times and by different declaration was ea.lled in question under a demurrer put in at a IlUbsequent stage of the action.

The reason for the division of the common counts into the three main heads seems to lie in the form in which the consideration and promise is stated.

These two counts were similar and sometimes used interchangeably, though the former applied more properly to personal services than to other matter causing a debt.

ACTIONS BASED ON NATURAL RIGHTS. SECTION 1.-IN GENERAL. § 43. The actions of Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case, and Ejectment are alike in that they are used to redress similar wrongs, wrongs whic~ are violations of original or natural rights. In this respect these actions differ from Debt, Covenant, Detinue, Special Assumpsit, and General Assumpsit, which, as explained in the preceding chapter, are based on secondary or acquired rights. § 44. These original or natural rights are either personal rights or property right!!. Every man has a right to personal security. Any violation of this right by interference with his person is a wrong for which he may have redress. Every man has a right to the' free enjoyment and use of that which belongs to him, whether it be his family, his goods and chattels, or his land. In one sense all are his property, and in this sense of the word property, his rights relating to them may be called property rights. A violation of anyone of them is a wrong for which the person injured may sue in the courts for relief. At common law he may adopt one of the :five forms of action above mentioned, according to the nature of the injury complained of, and the kind of relief which he wishes to secure. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ACTIONS BASED ON NATURAL RIGHTS. 33 § 45. In the actions of Trespass, Trover, and Case, as will be explained more fully hereafter, damages alone are sought, and usually for more or less direct injuries to person or property. It is significant, and somewhat illustrative of the state of society, that we find very few of these actions in the early reports com-pared with the large number involving questions re-lating to real estate.1 The explanation of this is not difficult to find. It is certainly not because the rights of personal security and enjoyment of property, for violations of which these actions furnished the remedy, were unasserted, but because in the beginning of or-ganized society men were much more prone to redress direct injuries to person or property with the sword than by resort to actions at law. In further confirmation of this, such actions as we do find of this character are usually actions upon the case for the redress of indirect injuries not resultant upon direct forcible acts which would be likely to create hot blood. § 46. The actions of Replevin and Ejectment are different from the other three of this class, Trespass, Trover, and Caire, in the nature of the relief sought. Whereas in the latter damages is the object; in the 1 In lIr. BaUdon's introduction to Vol. III. of the Selden S0-ciety Publications (Vol. I. of the Select Civil Pleas), he 8ays: ..

SECTION II.-TRESPASS. § 47. The form of action known as Trespass, takes its name from the wrongful act for which it furnishes a means of redress. The legal meaning of the word trespass is any direct physical interference with the person or property of another. A blow to the per-son, a taking of personal property, a going upon the land of another, are instances of trespass. Injury to the person or property may result from other acts, such as the putting of an obstruction in the highway, or the negligently kindling of fire upon one's own land which spreads to a neighbor's: these acts are wrongful acts -they are violations of rights just as much as direct acts are, but they are not 'respasses, and to adopt the action of Trespass for their redress would at common law be fatal to a recovery. § 48. For convenience in treating of the declaration in the action of Trespass, the action may be divided into two classes: ( a ). Trespass for inj ury to the person. (b). Trespass for injury to property. § 49. To show a good cause of action in trespass for injury to the person, the declaration need contain only a statement of the wrongful act. This is only an apparent exception to the general rule that in all forms of actions the declaration must contain a statement of the right and of the violation Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ACTIONS BASED ON NATURAL RIGHTS. 35 of that right, or the wrong. A little reflection will show that a formal statement by the plaintiff of his right as a human being not to be injured would be absurd. This right is something which every person possesses, because of the fact that he is a person. It cannot be questioned by the court or controverted by the defendant. There is, therefore, no necessity of alleging it. The action, however, is none the leas based upon the possession of a right by the plaintiff and its viola-tion by the defendant. The right does not need to be stated, because the court is already informed of it. A statement simply of the wrong is, therefore, all that is required. § 50. In trespass for injury to property, the tres-pass complained of may be either to personal property or to real estate. The right not to have one's property injured belongs to everyone, but, given an injury or trespass, one must show that the property injured was his, in order to show that he is the wronged person, and the one entitled to recover. This is so whether it be personal or real property which is affected. § 51. To show a good cause of action in trespass for injury to property real or personal, the declaration should contain: (a). A statement that the property injured was the\" plaintiffs.! For the purposes of the action, legal own-1 Dannet v. CoIIingdell, 2 Shower 395; Burser v. Martin, Croke's Jac. 46.

Since the incidents of owner-ship, and among them the right not to have the prop-erty injured, prima facie, follow possession, possession was deemed sufficient. The possession which gives one the right to recover for injury to personal property differs from that in the case of real property. In the former case the possession may be: (1), bare, naked possession un-coupled with right; (2), possession coupled with own-ership; or, (3), ownership coupled with the right to immediate possession, designated frequently as con-structive possession. In the case of real property, . actual possession is necessary to support the action; 1 the ownership mayor may not be in the plaintiff. The third case mentioned in respect to personal prQperty, that of ownership coupled with the right of immediate possession, is not sufficient to support the action of trespass in respect to real property. The owner must first regain actual possession of the land.2 Trespass. The plaintiff alleges in his declaration the taking of .. horse from the person of the plaintiff. Plea, not guilty.

AB the court is fully informed of the existence of this right there is no need of a formal statement of it, and there is nothing left for him to allege, but (b). A statement of the wrongful act on the part of the defendant. It has been thought somewhat singular that the action of trespass was allowed for injury to a man's servant, wife, or child, by which he lost their services or society. The explanation seems to be that they were regarded as property; that certain benefits resulted from their possession, and that a direct act of inter-ference with them, w;hieh resulted in depriving a man of these benefits, was just as much a trespass as an act of interference with a man's horse, by which he was deprived of its use. The fact that the object injured in the case of the servant, for example, was a distinct personality separate and apart from the master, so that the same act which was a trespass to property from the master's standpoint, was also a trespaRS to the person from the servant's point of view, was im-lumed posseseion of the premise8 after the trespa8S was com-mitted, but before action, which was rejected by ~he Judge.

The action known as Trover or Conversion# and sometimes as Trover and Conversion, has for a long time been one of the most common forms of ac-tions adopted for redress of injuries to personal prop-erty whereby plaintiff is deprived of possession. The action was formerly one of the many actions included under the head of Trespass on the case, or Case.3 1 Jones v. Brown, 1 Espinasse, 217. I Where the benefits no longer existed, as in ease of termination of the service or separation of the wife, the man could not &bow that anything that was kiB had been interfered with, and hence neither trespass nor case was maintainable. Wheedon v. Tim-breIl, 5 Dumf. & East, 357; Postlethwaite v. Parkes, 3 Burrows, 1878.

The peculiar facts which supported the ac-tion as an action on the case, were the losing of goods by the plaintiff, the finding by the defendant, and the subsequent wrongful converting of the goods by him to his own use. It will thus be noted that in its orig-inal form the gist of the action was the wrongful con-verting of the goods. The matter of the plaintiff having lost them was merely an incident; so was the fact of the defendant having found them. These facts made no difference in the wrongfulness of the act of the defendant in converting them to his own use. The act would have been just as wrongful and just as actionable if the plaintiff had placed the goods in the defendant's possession to keep for him and the de-fendant had converted them, or if the plaintiff, whi~e retaining the ownership, had lost possession and the defendant had acquired it in any other way. § 54. The reluctance to adopt new forms and the predisposition to follow the path already made safe by precedent, which has always been characteristic of courts and lawyers, coupled with the evident adapta-bility of this form of action to all cases of a wrongful exercise of dominion over personal property, led to 'its extension to all acts of interference with personal property where the plaintiff was deprived of posses-sion. As thus broadened, the action became a sepa-rate form, and instead of being called an action of trespa88 on the case for trover and conversion (finding and converting), was known simply as an action of Trover or Conversion. The element of losing and finding remained for a long time as a formal allega-Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"40 PRINCIPLES 011' COMMON-LAW PLEADING. tion in the declaration, though manifestly a pure nc-tion in the majority of cases.1 As it did not have to be proven and could not be denied, no difficulty arose from this. § 55. The use of the term conversion as descrip-tive of all the wrongful acts which were redressed by this form of action, and the practice of alleging the . . act, whatever the proof might show it to be, as a con-verting to the use of the defendant, led to some em-barrassment. For example, the action of trover was adopted to rec<. ver damages for a converting by the defendant of the plaintiff's horse to his own use; the facts as proved would perhaps show that the defend-ant, having borrowed the plaintiff's horse, gave it to X, who rode it so hard that it died. This was any-thing but a converting by the defendant of the horse to his own use, at least in the original sense of the term. To meet this difficulty a rule came into exist-ence which has ever since played an important part in the action of trover. It was to the effect that a wro]giul refusal by the defendant to give up the property was conclusive evidence of his having COil-verted it to his own use.2 Thus, in the above instance, the plaintiff would demand the horse; the defendant 1 3 Bl.

He was, therefore, in the position of wrongfully refusing to deliver the property, and under the rule above referr~ to, the act of conversion was deemed proved. § 56. This form of action, however, was destined to a broader field than those cases where there was an actual conversion or where there was a wrongful re-fusal, and a way was soon found to apply it to all actions where there was it wrongful act depriving plaintiff of the possession of the goods. It was by a gradual, but a· very radical change, in the meaning of the term conversion~ so as to include all acts of the kind referred to. The\" converting of goods to the defendant's own use,\" became the exercising by the defendant of any \"act of dominion\" over the goods. This is the final development of the idea, and in this form it has been laid down repeatedly. The common-law action of conversion became, there-fore, a means of redress for a very large class of wrong-ful acts. The term conversion became a general term to designate these acts. § 57. A great deal will be found in the reports about conversion being established by the proof of other wrongful acts affecting the property from which conversion will be conclusively presumed. This rule is generally applied to the case of a wrongful refusal Digitized by Coogle J"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"-4:2 PRINCIPLES OF COMMON-LA.W PLEADING. to deliver up the goods, mention of which has been made above. It is believed that since the scope of the action has been broadened in the manner in which it has, there is no reason or necessity for the invoking of this rule. There is, of course, a literal converting to one's own use, such as eating or wearing of the goods, as the case may be; such act is wrongful and actionable, and is one of the acts which will support the action of trover. There are other acts of inter-ference with property, such as burning up another's property which happens to be in one's possession, or selling property which has been delivered to one as bailee, or taking property from the possession of an-other, or refusing to deliver up property which is de-manded by the rightful owner, which are all just as wrongful and just as actionable as the literal conver-sion of property; but they are not conversion in its original sense, nor does it accomplish anything or tend to clearness to say that they are evidence of conver-sion,-they may be evidence and they may not be. Certainly there is no logical connection between burn-ing property up and an intention to convert it to one's own use. And the refusal to deliver property to the owner is just as consistent with having lost it as having used it. It is only misleading in such cases to say that conversion is the ultimate thing to be proved and that such acts are conclusive evidence of it. In the broader sense in which the term conversion is used such acts are themselves acts of conversion. While they have been so denominated in the case of all the other acts which may now support this action, it is still custom-Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":". ACTIONS BASED ON NATURAL RIGHTS. 43 ary to treat the demand and refusal as evidence of an imaginary conversion. 1 § 58. To show a good cause of action in trover, the declaration should contain: (a). A statement showing that the property be-longed to the plaintiff. This is to so connect him with the property that it may appear that it is the plain-tiff's right not to have his property interfered with which has been violated. The plaintiff may rely upon an .actual possession or upon a right to an immediate possession. Either shows sufficiently the right of the plaintiff not to have the property interfered with. As we have already seen (§ 54) it was formerly customary to allege the possession in the plaintiff, the losing by him, and the finding by the defendant, but the very earliest cases do not show that the allegation of losing and finding was e~er held material. (b). A statement of the wrongful act or conversion on the part of the defendant. The gist of the act of conversion was its wrongful-ness. An act of interference with the property of another which was justifiable was not wrongful, and therefore was not a conversion. Such an act might be a justifiable trespass, but there is no such thing as a justifiable conversion. 1 In Baldwin t1. Cole, 6 Mod. 212, Chief Justice Holt lieeme to have thought that this rule ae to demand and refusal being evi-dence of conversion was superfluous, for he says that \"the very . denial of goods to him who has a right to demand them is' /I,.

If this distinction be bome in mind the ne-cessity and office of the demand and refusal about which so much is said iii. dealing with the action of trover, will be clearly understood. A proper state-ment of the conversion involves the statement of some-thing besides the mere act of interference with the property. It requires the statement of such facts as will show the act to be wrongful. These facts are either: (1), that the act of interference was wrongful in the beginning, i. e., was a direct interference with the possession, actual or constructive, of the plaintiff; or, (2), that the act of interference was a wrongful keeping of the property or refusal to give it up in re-sponse to a demand on the part of the plaintiff. In the former case no demand and refusal is neces-sary to make the act wrongful, and, tnerefore, it need not be alleged. In the latter case the act which is wrongful is the refusal, and this is the act which is really the ground of action, though, as pointed out above, it is usually treated as evidence of a· supposed converting of the property. As it is in reality the wrongful act, it must of necessity be alleged. It will be observed that where the plaintiff relied upon actuaZ possession as the basis of his right in the property which he claims has been violated, there is no room for the element of demand and refusal. 1 For the conversion here is always an original wrongful taking of, or interference with, the property. 1 Thil il also true where the plaintHf reliel upon what ia known aa COfI8truotiv6 poBle88ion.

The action of replevin was originally u~d as the remedy for an illegal distress. Distress was the common-law successor of the old feudal remedy of forfei ture. Under the feudal sys-tem if a tenant failed in the various services which were required of him, such as attending the lord in time of war, or tilling the soil, or attending to the lord's courts in times of peace, the lord might claim forfeiture of the land.! § 61. Under the common law, instead of the land itself being subject to forfeiture or seizure; the chat-tels of the tenant which were upon the land were subject to be seized or distrained by the lord for any failure by the tenant in respect to the incidents of. his tenure.2 The services required of the tenant which were incident to his tenure became reduced to certain fixed charges upon the land, such as rent, and the seizure by the lord of the tenant's chattels was usually for non-payment of rent or sonie like charge. This was gesignated a Distress. It was against the abuse of this power that the action of replevin was allowed as a remedy to the tenant. The action of Replevin is supposed to have been de-vised by Glanvil, which would fix its origin as some-where in the latter half of the twelfth century. § 62. The purpose of the action of replevirl., in its finally established form, was to restore immediately 1 Gilbert, Replevin; p. 2. I Hammond, Nisi Priull, p. 4.~3. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"46 PRINCIPLES OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING. to the tenant his chattels, so that he might proceed uninterruptedly with his husbandry, and also to give him damages for the wrongful seizure. The latter object, however, was subordinate, the recovery of the chattels being the real object of the action. The orig-inal proceedings in replevin were so peculiar, both . by reason of their form and of the practice and rules relating to them, that it has rendered the action a somewhat difficult one to understanci.. It would be beyond the scope of 'this book to go into the mass of ancient law concerning replevin. It may be found in the references cited.1 § 63. There is, however, a certain feature of re-plevin in its early form which it is important to under-stand. This is that it was really a combination of two things: (1), the proceedings by which a specific recovery of the chattels was had; and, (2), the pro-ceedings by which the legality of the seizure or dis-tress was determined. By the first proceedings the tenant really accomplished all he desired,-i. e., he got back his chattels. The second proceedings he proba-bly would have preferred not to continue, but in them lay the protection to the lord in case he had rightfully distrained, since here the m~tter of the legality of the distress was determined. Hence as a condition of th~ tenant having the benefit of the first proceedings he was required to give security that he would proceed with the second. The form which the second took was 1 Hammond, Nisi PriulI: pp. 372--460; Gilbert, Replevin, Chap· ter 2. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ACTIONS B:ASED ON NATURAL BIGHTS. . 47 that of an action for damages for an alleged illegal taking and detention. § 64. Originally the proceedings for specific re-covery were entirely separate from the action for dam-ages. They were before it in point of time; until they were concluded, no process was served upon the defend-ant to appear in the action for damages. They were instituted by a writ which the plaintiff procured from the Court of Chancery, commanding the sheriff to seize and restore to him his chattels, as a condition of procuring which writ he was obliged to give security to prosecute an action to determine the right to the chattels and to return them to the defendant if he could not show that the seizure was illega!.1 To this writ the sheriff made a return according to the facts, and if the return was to the effect that he was unable to replevy the chattels because he could not find them or because the defendant had sold or otherwise disposed of them, the plaintiff was entitled to various other writs for the purpose of accomplishing the object desired.2 The final outcome of the whole matter was that the plaintiff either did or did not get back his chattels. Here ended the preliminary proceedings for the spe-Cific recovery of the chattels and at this point the action for damages began. 3 If the plaintiff had sue-1 This requirement as to S\"ecurity for the return of the chattels was not originally required, but was imposed -by the statute of Westminster, 2, c. 2. 2 Gilbert, Replevin, 80, 91, et 8eq. 8 This distinction between the proceeding . to recover actual possession of the goods and the action resultin~ from the pro-ceeding was recognized ,by Chief Justice Willes in Pearson tI.

If, on the contrary, the sheriff had been unable to :oestore to him the chattels because of their destruc-tion, sale, or concealment by the defendant, the plain-tiff could still proceed with hill action, and, as will be seen later, the full value of the chattels would be included in his damages. § 6&. The manner in which the plaintiff proceeded with his action was similar to that in any other action. The defendant was summoned into court 1 to answer the plaintiff's declaration, in which was set forth the facts constituting the plaintiff's cause of action for damages for the wrongful taking and detention, and to which reference will be made more fully hereafter. Roberts, Wllles' Reports, 66S (1766), where he says, p. 672, \"There are two forms of replevins, one only to have the goods again which may be by plaint in the Sheriff's Court, or a man-datory writ to the Sheriff and another by way of action to re-cover damages,\" and was used by him as a ground of deciding ~e ease. At that time, however, the two proceedings had be-come so amalgamated into One, and, in 'Spite of the peculiar method. of obtaining the principal relief at the commencement of the action, had been so long regarded as an action i\", rem.,-i. e., for specitlc recovery,-that the authoritielt scarcely war-ranted Chief Justice Willes in using the distinction all the basis of his deciaion in the ease. The ease of Millard 11. Caffin (2 Sir W. Blackstone, 1330), in 1778, and that of Fletcher 11. Wilkins (6 Eut, 283), in 1805, show the way in which the different pro-ceedings in replevin had all come to be regarded as parts of & Bingle action in rem. 1 Gilbert, Replevin, pp. 83-85.

This method of proceeding by writ was found to be extremely cumbersome, and it was dis-covered that little was accomplished by the proceed-ings subsequent to the writ itself compared with the time and trouble involved. As a consequence, they gradually fell into disuse. By a statute,l it was then provided that upon an ordinary complaint, or U plaint/' as it was called, to the sheriff and the giving of the necessary security, the sheriff could at once recover the chattels by issuing a precept to his bailiff to seize them. At the time of the seizure the action was also begun by the bailiff summoning the defendant to appear in court to answer the plaintiff's declaration.2 It will thus be seen that the summary method of restoring the chattels to the plaintiff was practically incorporated into the action itself. § 67. This change in the method of proceeding resulted in the disappearance of a practice which pre-vailed of framing the declaration in replevin according to the result of the sheriff's efforts to seize the chattels and restore them to the plaintiff . • Under the old method of recovering the chattels in the proceeding by writ, if the sheriff was success-ful in restoring the goods to the plaintiff, the declara-tion in the action alleged the detention as a completed act, and was said to be in the detinuit (he detained). If the sheriff was not successful in restoring the chat-tels to the plaintiff, the declaration alleged the de-1 Statute of Marlbridge, c. 21. :I Gilbert, Replevin, p. 80. 4 Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"60 PRINCIPLES OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING. tention as still continuing, and it was said to be in the detinet (he detains). In the one case the damages were limited to the injury suffered by the detention; in the other, they included also the value of the goods. If only a part of the goods were restored, the declara-tion was in the detinuit as to those which were restored, and in the detinet as to the rest. 1 § 68. But with the new method of commencing the action for damages at once upon the institution of the proceedings by plaint to the sheriff, it must have happened frequently that the declaration was made out at the commencement of the proceeding, or at all events before the results of the sheriff's efforts to find and restore the goods could be known with cer-tainty, and it became impracticable to observe this dis-tinction between declaring in the detinet and in. the detinuit. The declaration was therefore always made 1 In Small's Declarations, Replevin, p. 34, will be found an example of this, which appears to have been taken from the records of an actual case. As instances of this sort of declara-tions are rare, I quote this declaration in full: \"88.: W. Burton, of L. Chaplain, and B. W. were summoned to answer unto J.

The distincti.on between the so-called action of replevin in the detinuit and that in the detinet was never anything but a distinction in form,3 and when it became impracticabJe to make the distinction it be-came obsolete. The distinction has been noticed her~ more fully than it otherwise would have been, because an impression has seemed to prevail that there were' at one time two different actions of replevin based upon it, in one of which, i. e., in the detinet, damages only were sought.4 1 Fitzherbert, Natura Brevium, 69 L. and Note (e). 2 Stephen, Pleading, p. 43. 8 Hammond, Nisi PriuS\", pp. 460, 461. 6 Chitty, in his work on Pleading (5th Am. Ed., p. 1(5), refers to the action as of two sorts, one of which, that in the deti.et, for the value of the goods and damagell, he says is obsolete. In Buller's Nilri Pril18 (p. 52), the action of Replevin in the detinet is treated as though it were an action commenced with· out the usual proceedings by writ or plaint, and it is compared, as to its advantages, with the aetion of Trespass. 1 Saunders, 347 b, note. 2, is to the same effect. In both Chitty and the note in 1 Saunders' Reports, the case of Petre 1). Duke, Lutw. 1147, is cited as an authority upon the distinction between the supposed two forms of Replevin. But the case is no authority upon the point, as an examination will show. In the English report of this case (Lutw., Nelson's Ed., 360), the writ is spoken of as being in the detitlet, and the declaration or count as in the detinuit. It is said that an exception was taken for this cause, ·but as the parties by agreement amended their plee.dings, the point was Dot passed UpOD. Then follows Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"52 l>RINCIl>LES OF COMMON-LAW l>LEADING. § '70. No case of replevin can be found in the re-ports where the object was not the specific recovery of the chattels and which was not commenced by the proceeding, either by plaint or writ, to obtain such recovery. 1 The statement of Chief-Justice Willes in the case of Pearson 11. Roberts, which has been quoted (ante, p. 47, note 3), has been construed as meaning that there was an action of Replevin for damages only, dif-ferent from the one which was instituted by the pro-the statement, \"but certainly it was a material objection, for in a Replevin in the detinet the plaintiff must recover the value .of the goods and his damages for the taking;. but if it is in the detinuit, that is in the preterperfect tense, it implies that the plaintiff hath his goods again; and therefore he \"han only recover for the wrongful taking.\" An examination of the original report in Lutw. 1147, shows that the word writ refers to the recital ot the writ contained at the beginning of the declaration, and that the substance of the objection therefore is that the allegation in the body of the declaration is'incons'istent with the recital, the one showing that the goods are still detained by the defendant, and the other that they have been restored to the plaintiff by the sheriff. In thill form the objection becomes intelligible, as an objection to the form of the declaration upon the theory that the court could not say what damages to award unless it was clear whether or not the plaintiff had succeeded in getting back the property. In the other form the objection is not intelligible, but only confusing, as it is no objection that the urit or plaint i8 in the detinet and the declaration or count in the detinmt. In fact the writ or plaint is always and rightly in the detinet, since the goods at that time are in the defendant's possession, and the declaration is as a matter of fact usually in the deti,\",U. This case is correctly cited in Gilbert, Replevin, p. 167, and in reality only confirms the explanation given in the text of the real nature of the distinction between Replevin in the detinet and in the detimlit. 1 Fletcher v. Wilkins, 6 East, 283. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ACTIONS BASED ON NATURAL RIGHTS. 53 ceedings for specific recovery. Lord Ellenborough, in Fletcher v. Wilkins (6 East, 283, at p. 286), so con-strues it, for he says: \"An~ Lord Ch. J. Willes there distinguished between a replevin by plaint or man-datory writ to the sheriff, to have the goods again, and replevin by action to' recover damages.\" He ex-presses the opinion, however, that the statement is not correct, and that there is no such action of reple'in for damages only. It has already been explained that Willes probably had in mind the early distinction be-tween the proceedings for the recovery of the chattels, which were preliminary to the action for damages for the seizure, and the action itself. § '71. Although it is not the purpose of the writer in this part of the book to treat of pleadings subsequent to the declaration, yet in the action of replevin it is proper under this head to examine the first pleading on the part of the defendant which was frequently a declaration in fact though not in name. Wherever the defendant claimed the right to the . chattels, he set up his right and prayed for their re-turn, and damages for their detention, in a pleading which was called the avowry or cognizance. 1 This was in every respect like a declaration and was so treated.2 As will be seen later~ the plaintiff pleaded to it as 1 Where the defendant alleged. a. right in himself, by virtue of which he seized the goods, the pleading was called an lJoowry j where he alleged the right in another, by whose command he acted in making the seizure, the pleading was called a cognizlJfICe (or COIW8IJftC6, Trevilian tJ.

If the defendant claimed no right in the chattels, but denied the seizure, there was a regular plea, as in ~ther actions, which he could put in, and this element of a cross action by avowry or cognizance did not enter into the action. § 72. The origin and nature of replevin has been so~ewhat fully described. It has been seen that one of the peculiarities of it was the manner in which the plaintiff recovered his goods in the first instance be-fore or at the very commencement of the action. This peculiarity survived through the various changes which the form of the action underwent, and has always been a distinctive feature of it. As a result, in this form of action there was no waiting for relief until the determination of a possible lengthy suit; no risk of a disposal of the chattels so that specific recovery would be impossible. Here' was relief at the start, and of a very substantial kind.

An at-tempt was made to broaden the form of action so as to include all cases where detinue or trover could be brought.2 This attempt was not successful, as it was thought to be an injustice to allow this summary method of regaining possession to be used in case the defendant 'had acquired possession by no wrongful act, but simply refused to acknowledge the right claimed by the plaintiff.

There was, however, a large general class of actions left, actions of so varied a character as to the facts upon which they were based, that they could not well be brought within anyone or more forms. These are the actions which have, since the branching off of Assumpsit and Trover, constituted the class of actions known as Oase. § 83.

The form of action known as Ejectment is ~ good illustration of the length to which the courts some-times went in adapting established forms to new uses. 1 The action was, in the beginning, an action of tres-pass brought by a person in possession of land under a lease for years, against one who entered upon the land and ejected him. It was known as the writ of ejectione firmre. 2 Th~ object was simply the recovery of damages. This relief, however, was inadequate, especially where the tenant had a long term, and the practice grew up of applying to a court of equity for relief -against the lessor for specific performance, against a stranger for an injunction restraining him from interfering with the tenant's possession. This carried a great deal of business into the equity courts from the courts of common law, and resulted in the latter adding to the relief by way of damages, given in the action of ejectione firmre, relief by way of spe-cific recovery.3 Such relief was, however, never prayed 1 ID! 3 Blackstone Com., p. 200 et seq., will be found the his-tory, in detail, of the action. 2 The earliest recorded instance of the bringing of an action of this kind is said to be that in Year Book Trin. 44 Edw.

The trespass complained of was the ejection of the plaintiff from the possession of the premises. If the plaintiff had been on the premises as a mere intruder and had no interest in the premises which entitled him to possession, and, on the contrary, the defendant entered, ousted the plaintiff, and took pos-session himself, claiming to be entitled thereto, his act was not a wrongful one; at least not wrongful. as far as the plaintiff was concerned, for it was no viola-tion of any right of the plaintiff's; not of his right to the undisturbed enjoyment of his property, because it was not his; not of his right not to have his person interfered with, because he was wrongfully on an-other's land, and his right in that respect was subject to the right of the defendant to oust him with all neces-sary force. It resulted, therefore, that the plaintiff in the action was bound to allege and prove his right to the possession of the land, or his title, as it is generally called, in order to show that the defendant's act of ousting him '\\Vas wrongful. § 88. As the action was always brought by a les-see for years, the elements of his title consisted of a good title in his lessor, a lease to himself, and an entry under the leaee.

W PLEADING. to land in the possession of another determined. Yet such were the resources of the lawye.rs that they found a way to utilize the action as a general means for tho trial of title. The manner adopted was to have A, the claimant of the land, make a formal entry upon it (in the absence, or at all events without the knowledge, of the person really in possession), and execute a lease to B, some friend who accompanied him. B remained upon the land until X, the person actually in possession, returned or discovered him, and then considered himself ejected. An action was then brought in B's name against X. B's right depended upon the title of A, his landlord, and A's title to the land was thus deter-mined. As B was a friend to A, if he succeeded, A had no difficulty in getting the possession. § 89. The next step in the development of the action was to procure 0, another friend of A's, to casually happen upon the land shortly after the mak-ing of the lease and eject B, instead of waiting for X to eject him. B then brought the action against 0, and if :x hew nothing about the proceedings, or they were intentionally concealed from him, he would be ousted from the premises under the judgment re-storing them to B, without any chance to defend his right to them.1 Therefore the rule was adopted, which was made use of afterward so effectively by Rolle, re-quiring 0, the casual ejector, to notify X, the person iD. actual possession of the land, that an action had been brought against him for ejecting B from the land, and l.Adam\", Ejectment, pp. 12, 13.

Here the inventive genius of Rolle saw a chance to simplify things. Here W!1S a chance to im-pose conditions upon X, who was an applicant to the court for a favor, to wit, to, be allowed to come in and defend the action. X was, therefore, compelled to stipulate to admit on the trial the fact of the making of the lease from A to B, the entry and subsequent possession by B, and the ouster of B by 0.2 There was nothing left then to try but the title of B's lessor A. The lease, entry, and ouster had never been more than a hollow form; now as a result of this rule, they be-came a fiction pure and simple. Even the. form was no longer observed, and it was customary to allege the lease to.J ok\", Doe, entry by hiin and ouster by Rickard Roe, fictitious names merely used for the purposes of the suit.

To show a good cause of action in ejectment the declaration should contain: (a). A statement of the plaintiff's rights. The ac-tion is really brought for a violation of both the plain-tiff's right not to have his person interfered with, and the right to the undisturbed e.njoyment of his property. The former needs no statement; the latter, however, will not appear to attach,to the property which is the subject of the suit, until an allegation is made of such facts as will show that the property belonged to the plaintiff. These facts, since ejectment is always brought nominally by a lesse~, are the title in the lessor (impliedly alleged by the allegation of the lease), the lease, and the entry and subsequent possession. (b). A statement of the wrongful act on the part of the defendant. The wrongful act is the ouster, and the declaration follows out the theory of the action by alleging it and praying damages therefor. Originally the damages were substantial in amount, but when the fiction which has been described was adopted, and the real defendant though not the nominal one was compelled to admit the ouster as a condition of being allowed to come in and defend the action, it was not deemed fair to give any substantial damages against him, and nominal damages only were allowed. The plaintiff, if successful, could subsequently re-cover his damages for loss of the profits of the land during the defendant's wrongful occupation by another action known as an action of trespass for mesne profits.

Two general methods of answering the declaration ~ere open to him -the first, by way of a demurrer; the second, by way of· a plea. § 94. These two methods were entirely unlike in their nature and effect. The demurrer was a pleading which could be used by either party at any stage of the pleadings, provided the other had not already used it, and provided issue in fact had not been joined.1 The defendant could demur to the plaintiff's declaration. If he did not demur, but put in a plea, the plaintiff could demur to the plea. If the plaintiff _did not demur, but put in a replication, the defendant could demur to the repli-cation;. and so on through the whole list of successive pleadings. But when a demurrer had been put in by either party, the pleadings were at an end, as there could be no demurrer or pleading to it.2 § 95. The effect of the demurrer was to raise a question of law upon the pleadings as they stood prior to the demurrer, which it was the province of the judge .1 Calverac 17. Pinkero, Prac. Reg. Com.

The rule was a harsh one; however, as a party was frequently thrown out of court upon some technical defect in his pleading, which, as he had no notice of the ground of the demurrer, he was not pre-pared to meet.

If, on the contrary, the pleading was held good and the demurrer overruled, the party demurring was deemed to have had his chance in court, and as he had chosen to rely upon some defect in the other's pleading instead of answering the facts set forth, final judgment was given against him.2 It is customary everywhere at the present time for the courts to allow an amendment in case a pleading is held to be bad on demurrer. § 103. There was one exception to the rule that final judgment would be given on a demurrer. It was in the case of the plea in abatement. The plea in abatement was, as will be seen later,3 a dilatory plead-ing, i. e., it was interposed solely for purposes of delay.

A general demurrer before the statute of 27 Elizabeth, as has already been observed, tested the sufficiency of a pleading both in substance and form. A good illustration of this is found in the case of J. S. of Dale 'I). J. S. of Vale,! which was in substance as follows: A 'I).' X. Trespass for taking the plaintiff's goods. X pleads that he (X) was possessed of the goods as his own until A took them. and gave them to the plain-tiff. A demurs generally to the plea. Judgment for A. The plea is bad. The statement that A took the goods and gave them to the plaintiff is no more than saying that the plaintiff took them, since A is in fact the plaintiff, and therefore amounts to nothing. The substance of the plea, therefore, is that the goods belonged to X, the defendant. It was held that this amounted to a general denial of the trespass, and hence the form of the plea should have been not guilty. § 106. Since the statute referred to, the office of the general demurrer has been limited to matters of substance entirely. It has been shown in the preced-ing chapters what matters constitute the substance of the declaration in the various forms of actions. These matters all go to make up the cause of action, and if .... the cause of action is imperfectly made out by reason of the omission of anyone or more of them, the result will be that the declaration will be held to be bad upon general demurrer. 1 Jenkins' Century Cases, 133; Ames' Cases, 1.

They must contain matters which, admitting them to be true, constitute a valid answer to the facts set up in the preceding pleading, otherwise they will be bad upon general demurrer. § 108. But with matters of form the general de-murrer, after the statute, had nothing to do. Matters which constituted evidence of the falsity of the facts set up in the preceding pleading, and which should have properly been brought in as evidence under a general denial of the wrongful act charged in the declaration, or a specific traverse or denial of some fact stated in the pleading, might be set out in full and no objection could be made to it under a general demurrer. § 109. There was, however, one exception to this rule; and that was in the case of a plea in abatement. Even after the statute of 27 Elizabeth which resulted in limiting the use of general demurrers to matters of substance, the courts found a way to preserve its full scope in respect to the plea in abatement. It may have been because in the case of a plea in abatement judgment upon the demurrer was not final, and, there-fore, an injustice, by reason of the party not being informed of the defect upon which his adversary in-tended to rely, was less likely to occur. Whatever may be the reason, the fact remains that the court did not apply the statute in the case of a demurrer to a plea in abatement. The case of Walden 1).

Chief Justice Holt says: \"Mat-ters of form may be taken advantage of on a general demurrer when the plea only goes in abatement, for the statute of Elizabeth only means that matters of form in plea which goes to the action shall be helped on a general demurrer.\" § 110. It has been said before that a general de-murrer is an admission of the facts stated in the plead-ing demurred to~ But the admission is solely for the purpose of determining whether the facts are sufficient in law, i. e.~ constitute a good cause of action.

The admission of facts by a demurrer is subject to four qualifications which are generally recognized in the cases. (1). A general demurrer does not admit what the court, as a court, knows to be impossible or knows to be untrue. This is for the reason that the court is assumed to be an intelligent body, conversant with the ordinary laws of nature and with all facts of a public nature. A v. X. Action of Trespass for assault and battery. X pleads that A entered his land and broke and dis-placed stones thereupon, and to stop him, he, X, threW' stones at him gently, and they fell upon him gently. General demurrer.

Plea that X never received the money on A's account. Upon the issue being tried by the jury it is found that X did receive the money. In the old action of account the practice was for the defendant to plead anew before the auditory, as it was called. The proceeding before the auditory or auditors was practically a second stage of the same :action. X, in his plea before the auditory, again pleaded that he did not receive the money on A's ac-count. A demurred generally. Plea bad; the de-murrer does not confess the facts stated in the plea, 1 Cole 1'. Maunder, 2 Rolles' Abridgment, 548; Ames' Cases, 2.

A distinction, however, is made between what the court as a judicial tribunal have knowledge of, and what the judge or judges may know in their private capacity. Although the judges, in their ca-pacity as private citizens, may know certain facts stated in the pleadings to be untrue, still if the subject is one of which they cannot in their judicial capacity take notice, on a demurrer they will have to regard them as true. \"-A 'V.

To understand this case, it should be noted that a court cannot take judicial notice of a special local custom; if it had been a general custom upon which A based his right to recovery, the court could have taken judicial notice of its existence.2 § 113. (2). A general demurrer does not admit a . conclusion of law. It is not proper to allege in a pleading a conclusion of law. It is for the court to draw the necessary conclusions of law from the facts stated in the pleading and proved at the trial, nor can 1 Tresham fl.

The question can seldom become matel'ial, as there are few instances where it would make any difference whether or not they were deemed admitted. There is one case, however, in which the matter has become important, and that is where the immaterial allegation is of some matter which may involve the application of a statute. A v. X. Action of Trespass, quare clausum fregit, for $70 damages. A alleged in his declaration both possession and ownership of the land. X demurred. The declaration, for some reason which is not mate-rial to the point in question, was held insufficient and judgment given for X for $70. A appealed.

There is a statement by Holt, to the effect that there were special demurrers at com-mon law, though the kind of special demurer to which he seems to refer was one upon which \"the party could take advantage of no other defect in the plead-ing but that which was specially assigned for cause of his demurring.\" 1 Since at common law, upon a general demurrer, a party could take adV'llntage of all defects both in form and substance, it is not surprising that no cases of the use of the special demurrer are found. § 117. The following cases illustrate the nature of a special demurrer as fixed by the statute referred to, and by the later statute of 4 Anne, Ch. XVI., S. 1, in respect to its calling in question only those mat-ters of form which are definitely stated in the demurrer. A v. X. Action of Trespass, quare clausum fregit. The declaration alleges a trespass upon a certain day in a certain close. X pleads that the trespass was com-mitted at another day in another close. A demurs generally.

The question was whether the omission to show how the rent descended from one M to another M was a matter of form, which could only be taken advantage of by special demurrer, or a matter of substance. It was held that the cognizance was good, as the omis-sion was a formal defect and could not be taken ad-vantage of on a general demurrer.1 § 118.

Though the demurrer would be overruled as a special demurrer, nevertheless the demurrer is sustained and judgment given for A. This is because the special demurrer includes a general demurrer, and the plea being a denial of an· immaterial allegation, is bad in substance. § 119. The special demurrer at the present time plays very little part in the proceedings in an action, as it has almost everywhere been superseded by some other method of taking exception to formal defects in a pleading. It is customary, too, at the present time for the court to allow either party to amend any informality or technical defect in the pleading. Statutory enactments provide various remedies in· case of pleadings which are improperly drawn or which in any formal respect are objectionable. The most common of these are motions which may be made by the objecting party on notice to his adversary -such as a motion to strike out \"irrelevant, redundant or scandalous matter;\" 1 a motion to require a pleading to be made more definite and certain; 2 a motion to strike out a defense as sham 3 and the like. 1 N.

There was a peculiarity.about the demur-rer which made it somewhat dangerous for a party to use unless he was perfectly sure that his own plead-ings were properly drawn. This peculiarity was the effect which a demurrer had in opening the whole record, so that the court began with an examination of the declaration and took up successively eMh plead-ing with respect to its sufficiency, and then gave judg-ment against the party who had made the first mistake without regard to which one had put in the demurrer.!

X pleads a plea which is insufficient in substance (the nature of the plea is not shown). A demurs. Judgment is given for the defendant, although his plea is bad, for the reason that A's declaration is also bad, and the demurrer opens the whole record. To understand why the declaration is bad in substance, it is necessary to know that the law, at the time of this case, was that tempo-rary administration during minority of the regular executor ceased when the executor became seventeen. The plaintiff, therefore, by alleging that the executor was under twenty-one, did not show a right to bring the action. He should have alleged that the executor was under seventeen.3 1 This principle i& applicable today where the demurrer ilr used in systems of code pleading. Haaeelbach 1J.

X demurs. Judgment is given for the plain-• tiff. The first pleading which is insufficient is the plea, and although the replication is insufficient also, the judgment must be against the defendant on ac-count of his bad plea. This case illustrates the tech-nicality of the old law, which held that an allegation of the payment of money before a certain day, where the condition of the bond was payment upon such day, was not an allegation of performance of the condition. If X had pleaded payment on the day, and had shown in evidence payment before the day, it would have been held sufficient proof of the allegation.1 § 121. Where the record is opened by a demurrer, the court examines the pleading only for defects in substance. As defects in form could only be taken advantage of by means of a special demurrer, a party who did not demur specially to the pleading of his adversary was considered to have waived any infor-malities in the pleading, and had no further chance to take exception to such defects. A tJ. X. Action of Tre8pas8, quare claUS'Um fregit.

The first defect in sub-Judgment is, therefore, § 122. It has been said that a demurrer opens the whole record. This does not mean the whole record of the case, but only that portion which the demurrer terminates, and which, in reality, constitutes a sepa-rate and complete record by itself. It often happens that there are several records in the same suit, one of which may terminate in an issue of fact to be tried by a jury; another in an issue of law to be decided by the court. The latter is the case where there is a demurrer. To give a specific instance of this, there may, for example, be two pleas to a declaration; 1 to one of them the plaintiff may demur, and upon the other he may join issue; there are, then, two records for the court to determine the case upon. That they are en-tirely separate is shown by the fact that what is stated in the pleadings of one record cannot be introduced to affect judgment on the other. A v. X. X sold out his business to A and agreed not to carryon the same business within a certain limit. A brings an action of .Assumpsit for breach of the agreement by X in carrying on the same business within the prohibited locality. X pleads (1) that A did .not perform his part of the agreement, but in such a manner as to make the plea bad in substance; 1 Although at common law the defendant could put in but one plea, this rule was subsequently changed by statute.

(2) as a set-off against anything A might recover, that A was indebted to the defendant in the sum of $500. A demurs to the first plea, and replies to the second that he became a bankrupt and had pro-cured his discharge from his debts. Upon the argu-ment upon the demurrer, X claims that the replica-tion of bankruptcy made to the second plea shows that A had no right to bring the action, but that it should have been brought by his assignee; that as this appeared from the record, judgment on the demurrer must go against A. It was held, however, that the declaration, plea number one, and the demurrer con-stituted a separate record from the declaration,· plea number two, and the replication, and that as the mat-ter of bankruptcy appeared only in the second record, it would not affect the questions raised on demurrer. Littledale, J., says: \"We must treat the count, plea, and replication, and the count, plea, and demurrer, .as distinct records, and give judgment upon each with-out reference to the other.\" Judgment was given for the plaintiff on the demurrer. 1 § 123. It is to be observed, however, that the fact of there being two . separate records will not prevent the court from holding the declaration to be bad, if it appears upon the face of the declaration that it does not state a sufficient cause of action, and if one of the records terminates in a demurrer so that the record is opened. This is so even though the other record start-ing with the same declaration may have terminated with an issue of fact to be tried by the jury. A 11. X.

There is one exception to the rule that a demurrer opens the whole record. This is in the case of a plea in abatement. L pon a demurrer to this kind of plea the sufficiency of the plea alone is con-sidered. This exception may have resulted from the fact that the defendant, in case judgment went against him upon a demurrer to his plea in abatement, had a chance to answer the declaration a second time either by way of plea or demurrer, and was, therefore, de-prived of no privilege by the demurrer being confined to his plea.

Although a demurrer opens up the whole record, and the court examines all of the pleadings with a view to' giving judgment in favor of the party who appears upon the allegations in the pleadings to be in the right, yet it will not give judgment for a plaintiff upon any claim or cause of action which does not appear in the plaintiff's declaration, even though it may appear in the subsequent pleading.

But it was only for a fault which appeared upon the face of the declaration that the defendant could demur. If there were other mistakes which the plaintiff had made in the bringing of his action, or in his declaration, which did not appear upon the face of the declaration, the defendant could not take advantage of them by a demurrer. § 128. There was a method, however, by which he ·could bring them to the attention of the court, namely, by the use of a dilatory plea. The object of this plea was to put a stop to the par-ticular action brought, either temporarily by having it Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"DILATORY PLEAS. 95 adjourned or suspended indefinitely, or permanently by having the declaration abated. The effect from the plaintiff's standpoint was, in the case of a suspension of t~e action; that he could proceed with the suit at some future time, when the reason which constituted the ground of the dilatory plea had ceased to exist; in the case of the abatement of the action, that he could commence anew in the same court, or, if the ground of the plea was lack of jurisdiction, in another court which had jurisdiction. § 129. It was characteristic of the dilatory plea that to have the benefit of it the defendant must use it at once. He could not put in a regular plea and then, discovering there existed ground for a dilatory plea, seek to take advantage of it at a later stage in the action. Where, for example, a plaintiff in his declaration de-scribed his name as Ja.mes; and on the trial it appeared his name 'was Jacob, it was held that defendant was precluded from taking advantage of the misnomer on a motion in arrest of judgment.1 § 130. Dilatory pleas may be divided into three general classes, in respect to the effect which they have upon the disposition of the action: (1). Pleas to the jurisdiction of the court. (2). Pleas in suspension of the action. (3). Pleas in abatement. § 131. '(1). The plea to the jurisdiction of the court was in substance a statement that the plaintiff 1 Aldredge tI. Wood, Pract. Reg., p. 7. Digitized by Goog I e"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"96 PRINCIPLES OF COl(l(ON-LAW PLEADING. h~d commenced his action in the wrong court, either because the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action or of the parties theretQ, and that on that account the defendant .ought n.ot to be com-pelled to plead. A judgment for the defendant upon a plea to the jurisdiction was a virtual ending of the suit, as far as the particular court in which it wag brought was concerned. § 132. (2). The plea in suspension was a plea which showed matter, such as the excommunication or outlawry .of the plaintiff, by reason of which be was not entitled to prosecute the action at the time. A judg-ment for the defendant upon such a plea am.ounted practically to an adjournment of the case indefinitely. In the language of the time, it was that he \"go quit without day,\" but the acti.on was not abated, and upon an ending of the disability by pard.on, the plaintiff could pr.oceed with the action. 1 § 133. (3). The term plea in abatement has been quite generally used as synonymous with the term d#atory plea.2 This use of the term is inaccurate, as there is a very substantial difference between the plea in abatement and the other dilatory pleas. While the plea to the jurisdiction, if successful, disposes of the case entirely as far as the particular court is c.oncerned, and the plea in suspension merely suspends the progress .of the suit temporarily, the plea in abatement .occupies a middle ground between the two. Its effect, if sue-1 Comyn,' Digest, title Abatement, E. 7, 6. II Ibid., B. 1. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"DILATORY PLEAS. 97 cessful, is to dispose of the particular suit, but toe plaintiff may commence anew upon the same cause of action in the same court, only being careful to avoid the mistake which caused the abating of his former suit. § 134. The dilatory plea, it has been said above, set up new affirmative matter. It was held that to justify the court in acting upon such matter there must be some guarantee of its truth. Hence an affidavit of truth was required to be submitted with the dilatory plea, and if the defendant failed to accompany his plea with such affidavit of truth the plaintiff could disregard the plea and enter his judgment.1 § 135. Neither the plea to the jurisdiction nor the plea in suspension were so generally used as the plea in abatement. The last was at common law a very important plea. The dilatory plea, while it provided a means, like the demurrer, by which the defendant could avoid answering to the cause of action set forth in the decla-ration, differed from the demurrer in several important features. (a). It could be demurred to or pleaded to by the plaintiff. In itself it was a plea which set up new affirmative matter; and, though that matter did not relate to the merits of plaintiff's cause of action, it was material upon the question of whether or not the plain-tiff's suit should be thrown out entirely from the 1 Wilson tI.

Such matter could, therefore, be denied or answered by new matter on the plaintiff's part, .or it could be demurred to. (b). JUdgment upon the dilatory plea was not .final, as in the' case of judgment upon a demurrer; it did not determine the case upon the merits. Mention has already been made of the fact that the plaintiff could, upon judgment against him upon a dilatory plea, either begin the action again in another court, proceed with it in the same court at a later date, or begin anew in the same court. 1 In the case of the demurrer he could do no one of these things, as judgment ended the case once for all. § 136. Dilatory pleas, and more especially the class properly called pleas in abatement, seem to have been very widely used at common law. They must have been looked upon with great favor by the lawyers and with no very marked disfavor by the courts. It is often said that the rules respecting demurrers to dila-tory pleas show that the courts sought to discourage the use of them,2 but the manner in which the pleas were 1 Ante, p. 95. 2 The fact that the courts did not give final judgment against the defendant in case a demurrer to his plea in abatement waa eustained, as they might have done if they had wished to discour-age the plea, seem!! a stronger piece of evidence that the plea was looked upon with favor, than the fact that a general de-murrer to a plea in abatement tested matters of form a8 well as of substance, is of the contrary assertion. In fact, since the court. allowed the defendant to plead again if his plea in abatement was held ba<i, there was no hardship at aU in holding that a general Digitized by Coogle I ~ j I"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DILATORY PLEAS. 99 used, and abused, seems haraly to bear out this stata-ment. It was not the courts, but the legislature, which was finally compelled to step in and limit their effect by statutory provision. 1 The modem attitude of courts is unfriendly to the use of this class of pleas.2 § 137. Besides the division of dilatory pleas into the three general classes above mentioned, each class may be subdivided with respect to the matter which is alleged as the ground of the. plea, so that the whole classification will be as follows: demurrer should cover both matters of substance and form. The atatutory provision that a party demurring because of matters of form should specify the defects he relied upon, wall enacted to relieve the hardship which often resulted from a final judgment being given against a party upon some technical point which he was not prepared to meet. As no final judgment was given ag/MMt the dejeflda,., upon a plea in abatement there was no need for the application of the statutory provision. 1 The statute of 3 & 4 William IV., c. 42, s. 11, abolished a very large class of pleas in abatement, to wit, those of mimomet' .. abatemmt; section 8 of the same statute greatly limited the use of the plea in abatement for non-joinder of parties defendant.

CHAPTER III. ·/ .• : .... :: ....... .:-~LEAB BY WAY OF CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE • § 141. If a defendant decided that there were no defects in the declaration which would be ground for a demurrer, and if he knew of no reason which would be good cause for a dilatory plea, or if, having put in such a plea, he had been unsuccessful, then it was necessary for him to put in a plea which would answer the cause of action alleged against him. Such a plea was known asa plea in bar. There were two classes of pleas in bar .which were open to him: (1) plea~ by way of confession arid avoid-ance; (2) pleas by way of traverse. § 142. The plea by way of confession and avoid-ance is what its name implies -i. e., a plea which con-fesses the truth of the facts alleged in the declaration and seeks to avoid the consequences of them by alleging other facts which show that the defendant should not be held liable. These new facts constituted what was known as affirmative matter, and hence the pleas of this sort are frequently called affirmative pleas. § 143. A plea by way of traverse was in its nature a denial of some one fact or of all the facts set up in the plaintiff's declaration. The word traverse is syn-onymous with the word denial. This class of pleas will be noticed more fully in the fourth chapter. A Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"PLEAS BY WAY OF CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE. 103 good illustration of the form of a plea by way of con-fession and avoidance is shown by the following: (Plea of infancy to an action of debt.) \"And the said X, by --, his attorney, comes and defends the wrong and injury, when, etc., and says that he ought not to be charged with the said debt by virtue of the said supposed ·contract. Because, he says, that he, the said X, at the time of the making of the said supposed contract in the said declaration men-tioned, was an infant within the age of twenty-one years, to wit, of the age of --years, to wit, at, etc., . aforesaid; and this he the said X is ready to verify: wherefore he prays judgment if he ought to be charged with the said debt, by virtue of the said supposed contract, etc.\" § 144. It will be noticed that the plea concludes with the words, \"and this he die said X is ready to verify.\" This conclusion was known as a verification. All pleas by way of confession and avoidance must conclude in this manner.! An omission of this verifi-cation would be a defect in form which could be taken advantage of by a special demurrer. § 145. It was in early times the practice for the defendant to confess the facts alleged in the declaration by a form~l admission of them at the beginning of his plea.

In the following case it was treated as a formal defect only: A 11. X. Action of Debt upon a simple contract. X pleads that he was discharged under the Insolvent Debtors' Act \"from the debts and causes of action if any, and each and every of them.\" A demurs, specially assigning for a cause that the plea does not confess the cause of action. The plea was held to be bad in form, and judgment given for the plaintiff. 1 § 146. It was, however, finally established that no confession of the facts, direct or indirect, is necessary in a plea by way of confession and avoidance, upon the theory that whatever a party does not deny, he admits, for the purposes of the action at least. A 11. X. Action of Trespass for assault and battery. X pleads that \"if any hurt or damage happened or was occasioned\" to A, it was by reason of X necessarily ddending himself. Special demurrer, assigning for a cause that the plea does not sufficiently confess the· assault and battery. It was held that the plea was a sufficient confession, and judgment given for defendant.2 § 147. At the present time it is customary, in a plea by way of confession and avoidance, to state simply the facts which the defendant relies upon to relieve him from responsibility for the act alleged in the decla-ration as the plaintiff's cause of action. The form of the plea is therefore a statement of the facts, with an offer to verify them. If the plea is demurred to, the 1 Gould v. LaBbury, 1 C. M. & R. 254; Ames' Cases, 34. Z Wise v.

Pleas by way of confession and avoidance are of two kinds: ( 1 ) • Pleas in discharge. (2). Pleas in excuse. The distinction between the two kinds is expressed in their names. SECTION 1.-PLEAS IN DISCHARGE. § 149. A plea in discharge is one which not on~y admits *e facts stated in the declaration to be true, but also that the plaintiff at one time had a good cause of action against the defendant upon such facts, and then alleges new matter which shows that the cause of action no longer exists. This new matter is called matter in discharge. § 150. The most common forms of pleas in dis-charge are the following: (1). Pleas of payment,l -i. e., that the defendant has paid the debt or sum of money sued for. (2). Pleas of release. 2 Founded upon a release claimed to have been given by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1 Goodchild v. Pledge, 1 M. & W. 363; Ames' Cases, 37. I Brooke v. Stewart, 9 A. & E. 854.

A special plea founded upon the provision for the discharge of the debtor, usually contained in bankmptcy or insolvency statutes. (4). Plea of statute of limitations.2 A plea founded upon the sfatute requiring actions to be brought within a certain time. SECTION II.-PLEAS IN EXCUSE. § 151. A plea in excuse confesses the facts stated in the declaration to be true, and then alleges other facts which, together with the facts stated in the decla-ration, show that the cause of action, which the plaintiff has alleged, does not exist. § 152. Pleas in excuse cannot be divided into regular classes, as the matter set up necessarily varies according to the state of facts in each case. The use of this plea, however, differs somewhat in the different forms of actions, and it will be well to examine it with respect to each. § 153. In general it may be said .that the plea in excuse, in each form of action in which it iii used, admits such statements of fact as form the substance of the declaration. (a). Special .Assumpsit. § 154. In special assumpsit a plea in excuse admits the contract,-i. e., the promise and consideration, and 1 Gould 11. Laubury, 1 C. M. & R. 254; Ames' Cases, 34. 2 Eawstaft' tl.

For example, a collateral agreement or stip-ulation by which the defendant limited his liability for breach of a contract to a certain time or to a certain amount may be set up by a plea in excuse. -, A v. X. Action of assumpsit on a warranty of the soundness of a horse sold by X to A. A in his declara-tion alleges the warranty and the breach thereof, in that the horse was not-sound. X pleads that the horse was sold at auction subject to certain rules, one of which was that the seller should be relieved of all liability on a warranty unless notice of unsoundness was given before nOO1i of the day after the sale. Special demurrer, assigning for cause that the plea -amounts to a general denial of the contract, since it shows that the contract was not as stated in the declara-tion, and should have been pleaded under non assump-sit. The plea is held good, for the reason that it states a collateral agreement or stipulation.1 § 156. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish be-tween a collateral agreement and matter which consti-tutes a part of the principal agreement. This does not, however, belong strictly to the subject of pleading. When-the pleader has determined whether certain matter is a collateral stipulation or is a part of the 1 Smart _ 1.1.

The following is an illustration of the latter proposition: A 11. X. Action of assumpsit, upon an agreement by X to carry goods safely. X pleads in excuse an ex-press condition in the contract to the effect that A was to walk behind the cart and watch the goods, and that A refused to do so. Special demurrer, assigning for cause that the plea amounts to a general denial of the contract alleged in the declaration, and that non assump-sit should have been pleaded. The plea is held bad upon the ground assigned. 1 § 157. Where a defendant wishes to show that some part of the contract affecting his liability,-for example, a condition precedent,-has been omitted in the statement of the contract in the declaration, or that the real contract between himself and the plaintiff is different in any other respect from that stated in the declaration, he cannot set it up as matter in ~xcuse. A 11. X. Action of assumpsit. A alleges in his declaration that X agreed to buy from him a certain lease of a farm and to pay for the fixtures, manure, etc., left on the farm; that same were worth £1000, and that X refused to pay. X pleads that the actual agreement was that A, on receipt of the payment for the lease, was to execute and deliver an assignment of same and put plaintiff in possession, which he failed 1 Brind tJ.

Special demurrer on the ground plea amounts to non assumpsit. The plea is· bad for the cause. assigned. 1 § Ui8. If the defendant wishes to show that there was. no consideration for the contract alleged in the declaration, it is clear that he cannot set it up by a plea in excuse; for a statement that there was no con-sideration is practically a denial of the existence of a contract. A 'V. X. Action of assumpsit. A alleges in his declaration that X, in consideration that A would em-ploy 0 as a collecting clerk, guaranteed the honesty of 0 to the extent of £500; that A employed 0, who stole a large amount of money; that X had notice thereof, but had refused to pay A. X pleads that A had already hired C before X guaranteed O's honesty. Special demurrer. The plea is bad, as it amounts to non assumpsit. If A had hired 0 before X promised, there was no consideration for the promise, and hence no contract.z (b). General Assumpsit. § 169. In the action of general assumpsit a plea in excuse admits the facts which show the existence of a debt, the implied promise. based on such debt, and the breach or non-payment of the debt, and then sets 1 Nash tJ. Breeze, 11 Y. &; W. 352.

If the defendant wishes to set up as a de-fense that the facts alleged in the declaration to con-stitute the debt are not true,-for example, where the work done by the plaintiff was not what the defendant requested,-he cannot plead this in excuse. A tI. X. Action of indebitatus assumpsit for work done by A for X in fixing a chimney. X pleads that the understanding \"was that A was to do the work in such a manner as to prevent the chimney from smoking, which he has not done. Special demurrer, assigning for cause that the plea amounts to a denial of the debt. The plea is bad for the cause assigned. It is in effect a denial that A did the work requested, and if this were so no debt arose. 1 § 161. It has been seen 2 that, in the form of action known as general assumpsit, the plaintiff recovers upon a promise, which the law implies, to pay a debt which is shown by the facts alleged in the declaration to exist. It is laid down as a rule that the law will not imply a promise until it is needed, and that as a result of this rule, in a case where credit is given, there is no implied promise until-the credit \"expires. Hence, where the _ defendant wishes to set up, for example, that the goods, for the price of which the suit is brought, were sold to him upon credit, and that the credit has not expired, 1 Hayselden t1.

For goods sold and delivered. X alleges as a defense\" that the goods were sold on a credit of four months, which term had not expired at the time the action was commenced.\" This plea is equivalent to a general denial and would be bad on special de-murrer.I § 162. Where the defendant wishes to show that the contract was not as alleged by plaintiff, but was a special one, he should not plead in excuse, for he is in effect denying the implied promise and may show the speciaJ contract under the general issue. A 11. X. For money paid out to the use of the de-fendant. X pleads that he entered into a contract with A by which the money paid· out was to be paid under certain conditions which had not been complied with. The plea is bad as amounting to the general issue.2 (c). Debt. § 183. In the action of debt, a plea in excuse ad-mits the subject-matter of the debt, whether it be the sale of g004s or the performance of work at the request of the defendant, a bond, a statute, or a judgment, and then sets up matter which shows that the defendant's failure to pay the debt is justifiable. 1 Cla1lin tI.

A debt being a sum of money owing from the defendant to the plaintiff, it exists as soon as that is given or done upon which it is founded. Thus, if goods are delivered to the defendant by the plaintiff at the defendant's request, a debt exists immediately upon the delivery, although a credit is given for their payment. So, if a bond is executed by the defendant, conditioned for the performance of work or the pay~ ment of a sum of money upon a certain day, a debt exists immediately upon the execution and delivery of the bond. In the former case the plaintiff cannot bring an action upon the debt at once because of the agree-ment as to credit, and in the latter case the defendant will not be liable, in an action in debt, until the time is up for the performance of the condition. In both cases, if an action is begun by the plaintiff, the defendant will have a good defense, not in the denial of the debt, but in justifying its non-payment by pleading in excuse that credit has not expired, or that the time for per-formance of the condition has not expired. § 165. It will be noticed that in respect to the pleading of credit not expired as a defense to the plaintiff's claim, the action of debt differs from the action of general assu~psit. (d). Trespass. § 166. In the action of trespass for injury to the person, a plea in excuse admits the commission of th~' act alleg'Cd, and sets up matter to show that the defend-ant was justified in committing the act; for example, Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"PLEAS BY WAY OF CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE. 113 in trespass for assault and battery, that he did it in self-defense~l § 167. In the action of trespass for injury to prop-erty, personal or real, a plea in excuse admits the posses-sion of the property to be in the plaintiff as alleged in the declaration, and the commission of the act of inter-ference upon which the plaintif1 bases his cause of action, and then sets up matter to show that the defend-ant's act was rightful This matter is usually something which shows that the defendant had an interest in the property, to which the plaintiff's possession was subject, so that the defend-ant had the right to deal with the property as he pleased; or something which shows that, although the plaintiff's possession of the property was rightful, still the defendant's act of interference was justified by the circumstances which attended it. § 168. The most common plea in excuse where the injury complained of is to the person, is that of self-defense, known technically as son assault demesne (his own assault first). A v. X. Action of trespass for assault and battery. X pleads that at the time of the injury complained of in the declaration, the plaintiff A assaulted the defend-ant X, wherefore X defended himself as he lawfully might, and that if A suffered any injury, the same was occasioned by reason of A's assault upon X.

The matter is correctly pleaded in excuse. 1 § 169. Where the injury complained of is to per-. sonal property, perhaps the most common plea in ex-cuse is ownership in the defendant. If the defendant is the absolute owner of the goods, he has the right to the immediate possession of them, and any act of interference with them, although they may be in the actual possession of the plaintiff, is rightful. § 170. Where the injury complained of is to real property, a common plea in excuse is that technically known as the plea of liberum tenementum,-i. e., that the property is the defendant's own freehold. § 171. It sometimes happens that the defendant wishes to show, as matter of defense, that the alleged trespass was -committed by him involuntarily. In such case he is virtually in the position of denying the com-mission of the act by himself as a responsible being. He is only the instrument used by some one else in the commission of the wrongful act. Where the defendant relies upon such a defense as this, he cannot set it up in excuse. In the case, of which the next illustration is a synop-sis, it is said: \"If A takes the hand of B and with it strikes C, A is the trespasser and not B,\" and the court, by its decision upon the facts before it, evidently ap-'proved this statement. If B had been sued in trespass, he should have pleaded not guilty. 1 Wise f7. Hodsall, 11 A. & E. 816; Ames' Cases, 59.

Trover. § 174:. The nature of the action of Trover has already been explained. 1 It has been seen that an essential part of the cause of action alleged in the declaration is the wrongfulness of the defendant's act, and that, unless the plaintiff can prove the act to be wrongful, it does not amount to a conversion. It results from this that, in this action, there is no room for a plea in excuse. To admit the conversion would be to admit the wrongfulness of the act, and the defendant cannot consistently admit the act to be wrongful and then go on to excuse it. A v. X. Action of Trover brought by A, as assignee of Y, a bankrupt, for the conversion of goods possessed by Y before his bankruptcy. X pleads that he recov-ered a judgment against Y, and the goods were seized by the sheriff under his judgment at his requ.est. Spe-cial demurrer. The plea is bad, as it sets up matter which ~ends to show that the act of X was not. wrongful. This amounts to a denial of the conversion, and X should have pleaded not guilty.2 § 175. The matters of defense which can be set up by the defendant in an action of trover can really consist of but two classes -those which show that the defendant's act was not wrongful, and those which show that the plaintiff had no possession, or right of. posses-sion, of the goods.

The last illustration shows that matters of the former class can-not be pleaded in excuse, and it is equally true that matters which show that the plaintiff has no possession, or right of possession, cannot be pleaded in excuse. A v. X. Action of Trover for certain goods. X pleads in excuse that the goods were left with him to ~ecure the payment of a sum of money for board fur-nished by him to A. Special demurrer. The plea is bad, as it amounts to a denial of A's right of possession, and X should have pleaded -a specific traverse of the possession or right of possession.1I § 176. The plea in discharge is as available in the action of Trover as in any other action, for this plea always admits the wrongful acts alleged and the plaintiff's cause of action thereon, but shows that the action no longer exists. '(1). Detinue. § 177. In the action of detinue a plea in excuse would admit the plaintiff's right of possession and the detaining of the goods by the defendant. By detain-ing is meant, not the passive act of keeping the goods where no right to their possession has been asserted by the plaintiff, but a positive act of detention where the circumstances are such that there is an obligation on the part of the defendant .to deliver them up.3 1 Post, page 143·144.

It would therefore seem that there was little room in the action of detinu~ for a plea in excuse. § 178. The right of possession on the part of the plaintiff is the basis of the action. Matter which shows a right to detain the goods on the part of the defendant is practically a denial of the plaintiff's right of posses-sion, and in such case a plea of not possessed should be used. The authorities, however, hold that where the defendant claims a lien on the goods he must plead it in excuse.1 § 179. Where the defendant relies for his defense upon the fact that he offered to give the goods up to the plaintiff, he cannot plead it in excuse. If he offered to give the goods up when the plaintiff demanded them, he did not detain them. The matter, therefore, is in no sense an excuse for a detention on the defend-ant's part. lock, C. B., in the opinion, says, referring to several definitions of the word detention: \"We are satisfied that the last (that the defendant holds the goods and prevents the plaintiff from having the possession of them) is the true meaning of the word detain; if it meant the mere keeping possession, not adverse, how could luch a possession form 'the ground of an action? If it meant that the defendant had omitted, and still omitted, to be active in bringing the goods to the' plaintiff, the action could not be main· tained without showing an obligation by contract to do so.

In the action of Replevin there is strictly no plea by way of confession and avoidance in excuse. The avowry or cognizance has some of the character-istics of this plea; it confesses the taking, and justifies it by showing the defendant's right to the chattels; but it is more like a declaration than a plea, and, upon the facts showing the defendant's right, prays for affirm-ative relief. There was one case, however, where the plea in excuse was said to be allowable: when the defendant relied upon the fact that the property in the chattels was in himself or in a stranger at the time of the seizure, he was permitted to plead this fact in a plea by way of confession and avoidance.2 It was usual, however, to plead this matter by a plea in abate-ment. This defense really formed the ground of a claim for the return of the chattels, and a prayer for such relief was added,3 so that it appears to have been more like the avowry in its similarity to a declaration, than like a plea. 1 P08l, page 136.

In the action on the case, for the same reason as in the action of trover and that of detinue, the plea in excuse plays an unimportant part. As has been shown, the substance of the declaration consists of a statement of such facts as are sufficient to show the plaintiff's right in respect to the subject of the action, sometimes called the inducement, and a statement of the wrongful acts committed by the defendant. A plea in excuse, if used, would admit the substance of the declaration; if that is admitted the defendant has prac-tically confessed the wrong and precluded himself from any defense, except matter in discharge. § 182. Most of the facts which, generally speaking, may be regarded as excusing or justifying the alleged wrongful acts are really matters which show that the acts are not wrongful and may be shown in evidence, as will be seen later, under the plea of not guilty. § 183. There is one case, however, where the plea in excuse is available to the defendant. This is in an action upon a case for slander or libel. Where the defendant proposes to defend the action by proving the truth of the slanderous or libellous words, he may set it up by plea in excuse. In fact, to avail himself of this defense it is the generally accepted rule that he must set it up by plea in excuse.1 1 If the action for libel or slander is an action upon the case and the rule be applied that the generaZ issue is a denial of all material a.UegatiOn& which make up the statement of the wrong.

A notion formerly prevailed that it was a good justification or plea in excuse to an action of slander or libel, that the defendant had spoken or written tne words complained of as the words of an-other. This, however, is not good law, and a plea in excuse, alleging such matter as a justification, will be held bad in substance upon a general demurrer. A v. X. Action upon the case for slander. A al-leges in his declaration that X maliciously said and published concerning A that A had been arrested. X pleads that the same time that he said that A had been arrested, he also said he had been told so by W. A demurs generally. The plea is bad in substance, as it contains no proper excuse. 1 § 185. In an action upon the case for malicious prosecution, the fact that the defendant had reasonable and probable cause fo'r the prosecution of the plaintiff then there would !leem to be no logical rea80n why the Courts should have excepted from the denial the allegation ei falsity. Yet the actions of libel and slander are two of the earliest fortml of oas6, and it may well be there had begun to crystallize about them technical rules which had their origin not in the logic of the situation but in the convenience of the pleader, the Court or the Jury in trying the iSS'lles. Perhaps there were deemed to be enough separate issues which could be availed of under the plea of not guilty (the defendant under it might show not only that he did not make the libellous statement, but any excuse weh a.s that it wall a privileged communication) and that it would simplify the trial if the parties and the court might know by the pleadings in case the defendant proposed to prove the truth of the words. Thus we see a rule of convenience grafted upon the system of pleading at the expense of consisteney. Yet; the results in this case cannot be said to be bad. :L McPherson \".

In this action, the gist of the wrongful ,ct alleged is its maliciousness; and maliciousness, in legal contemplation, is lack of reason-able and probable cause. Therefore to allege l'easonable and probable cause is to deny the wrongful act which is the basis of the action, and it is in no sense matter in excuse. A 'V. X. Action upon the case for malicious prose-cution. X pleads two pleas: (1) not guilty; (2) that it is true that he caused the indictment to be brought against A, but that he had reasonable and probable cause. A moves to strike out the second plea. The motion is granted, as the second plea amounts to the same as the first, and the existence of reasonable and probable cause can be shown in evidence under the first plea. 1 § 186. In an action upon the case for damages occasioned by negligence, the deiendant cannot set up contributory negligence upon the part of the plaintiff by a plea in excuse. If the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, the defendant's negligence is not in contemplation of law the cause of the injury to the plaintiff, and therefore not a wrongful act as far as the plaintiff is concerned. It does not, therefore, in any sense excuse or justify the wrongful act alleged as the basis of the action. A 'V. X. Action upon the case. A alleges in his declaration that X negligently ran its train into the train upon which A was travelling, whereby A was injured. X pleads that A's injury was caused by neg-1 Cotton 11.

Spe-cial demurrer, assigning for cause that the plea is an argumentative denial of the wrongful act. The plea is held bad for the cause assigned. X should have pleaded not guilty.1 § 187. In an action upon the case against a com-mon carrier for the loss of goods entrusted to his care, if the defendant wishes to show, as a defense, that the goods were accepted by him subject to certain conditions which were not complied with, he is virtually denying the bailment as it is alleged in the declaration. Now the bailment is the basis of the plaintiff's right to sue the defendant for the wrongful act or omission which has resulted in injury to, or loss of, the goods. It connects the plaintiff with the goods of which the de-fendant has actual and rightful possession, in such a way as to show that he has an interest which can be the subject of injury, and concerning which he can assert his general right to the undisturbed enjoyment of his property. Such matter as this, or any matter which tends to show that the plaintiff is not connected with the property in such a way as to bring an action concerning it, must be given in evidence under a plea denying the bailment, and cannot be pleaded in excuse. A 11. X. Action upon the case.

Special demurrer, assigning for cause that the plea was an argumentative denial of the bailment. Judgment is given for the plaintiff. The plea should have been a traverse of the bailment and not, as it was, in the form of a plea in excuse.1 (i). Ejectment. § 188. It has already been explained 2 that in the action of ejectment, the real defendant was only per-mitted to come in and defend the action upon certain conditions, one of which was that he should plead the general issue -i. e., not guilty -and on the trial admit everything except the plaintiff's title.

The word traverse has been us~d heretofore, although no explanation has been given of its meaning. It is synonymous with the word denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for his defense upon the fact that the allegations contained in the declaration as to the subject-matter of the action are untrue, he must put in the plea known as a traverse. The traverse must meet the particular allegations which the pleader expects to prove untrue. § 190. Before taking up in detail the different kinds of traverses, of which there are many, several general principles applicable to all traverses should be noticed. (1). Traverses are usually negative in form, though they may be expressed in affirmative terms, as when opposed to preceding negative allegations, e. g., repli-cation by way of traverse to a plea of the statute of limi ta tions. § 191. (2). It may be laid down as a rule that traverses must be expressed in terms of direct denial, and not be indirect or argumentative in character. The statement of facts, which are inconsistent with the truth of an allegation in the preceding pleading, is Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"126 PRINCIPLES OF .90MMON-LAW PLEADING. an indirect denial of such allegation. This is what is known as an argumentative denial. A traverse framed in this way will be bad on special demurrer. There is one exception to this rule, in the special traverse, which will be explained later. § 192. (3). Traverses must always end with what is known as a tender of issue; that is, an expression in formal terms of the traversing party's willingness for a trial by the jury of the matter denied. This is called concluding \"to the country.\" The following forru illustrates the manner in which a traverse is drawn: John Doe } ads. Richard Roe. In the King's Bench, . --Term, 5th George IV. And the said John Doe, by , his attorney, comes and defends the force and injury when, etc., and saith that he is not guilty of the said supposed trespasses' above laid to his charge, or any part thereof, in manner and form as the said Richard Roe hath above thereof complained against him. And of this he, the said John Doe, puts himself upon the country, etc. § 193. (4). When a traverse, in a proper form, is put in by either party, the other, if he does not demur, . must join issue,-i. e., he must state his willingness also to go before the jury with the matter. This is spoken of technically as a joinder of issue. Neither another traverse, nor matter by way of confession and avoidance, can be pleaded to a traverse.

A traverse ~ust always be confined to allegations of fact contained in the pleading of the opposite party. A conclusion of law, or as it is some-times known, matter of law, cannot be traversed. A v. X. Action of case for slander. A alleges in his declaration that X called A a \"false thief,\" to his great damage. X traverses that A was\" damnified\" by the words spoken. General demurrer. The plea is bad. It is a conclusion of law that one is injured by being charged with a crime. It is a principle in the law of slander and libel, that words charging an-other with a crime are actionable per se, and no dam-. ages need be proved. 1 . A v. X. Action of replevin for taking cattle.

Guenther, 232 Fed. 411 (U. S. Dist. Court). The motion was to strike out a traverse co~tained in a reply to a counterclaim set up in the defendant's answer. The traverse was of an allegation that the defendant had no knowl· edge and gave no consent to the plaintiff's conduct which was made the basis of the counterclaim. As it was an allegation which negatived a defense which the reply set up, or as the court called it, an \"anticipatory traverse,\" it was out of place and immaterial so far as the declaration was concerned. The reply in excuse was a good reply in excuse and the addition of a specific traverse of this immaterial allegation, it was held, did not make the reply objectionable; the court therefore re-fused to strike out the specific traverse of this immaterial alle-gation. The court, per Learned Hand, J., says: A difficulty faces a pleader, however, when the opposite party has already incorporated a traverse of a pollsible plea in avoidance in his own' pleading-\"leapt hefore he came to the stile.\" If he leaves unanswered such an assertion, though it is not really an allegation at all (i. e., a material allegation?), he hazards it being taken as such; indeed, he might strike it' out, for it has no proper place in the first pleading. However, being placed in this position through the fault of the first pleader it surely serves to con-. venience if he be allowed to couple a traverse of this antici-patory traverse along with the plea which the anticipatory traverse has denied.

Special demurrer, because the plea amounts to a traverse of the voluntary escape.

It is known by different names in the various forms of actions in which it is used, as non assumpsit in contract, not guilty in trespass. A specific traverse is one which denies specifically some one particular allegation in the pleading of the opposite party. Specific traverses, of course, differ according to the nature of the actions in which they are used, and the allegations which are denied by them. While the general issue is used only as a plea, spe-cific traverses are available to either party, in answer to any affirmative pleading of the opposite. party.

(a). Action of Special Assumpsit. § 202. In special assumpsit the general issue takes the form of non assumpsit. It is rather curious that the traverse non assumpsit should ever have acquired the name of general issue. Since the action of assumpsit was originally an action on the case, the stating of the contract seems simply to have been the statement of the plaintiff's right,-i. e.1 the inducement I' while the statement of the breach was a statement of the wrongful act by the defendant. One would expect, then, on the analogy of other actions, to find the term general issue applied to a travers~ of the breach, while the traverse of anything in the induce-ment -the consideration or promise -would assume the form of a regular specifir, tra'l:erse. § 203. The effect of non assumpsit is to deny the contract as set forth in the declaration. Hence, when the defendant relies upon the fact that he made no promise at all, that he did not mAke the promise alleged in the declaration, th!lt there was no consideration for his promise, or that the consideration was different from that· alleged, he must plead non assumpsit. 1 § 204. The plea of non assumpsit puts in issue only the material allegationto of the inducement and 1 Lyall fl. Higgins, 4 Q. B. 528; Ames' Case!J, 46, Gllte, p. 109; Sieveking t' Dutton, 3 C.

Declaration alleges X held a certain farm under an agreement, made with A's father, to leave the farm in as good condition as he found it, that on the death of A's father the farm descended to A in fee, that X did not leave the farm in as good condition as he found it. Plea General Issue. After verdict for A, X moved to set it aside on the ground A failed to prove the farm descended to him in fee, the evidence showing it descended in tail. Motion denied as the allegation as to the fee was immateriaI.2 § 205. It is well settled that, under the plea of non assumpsit, the defendant may take advantage of an omission by the plaintiff to state conditions precedent. 3 The reason for this is that the defendant can truly deny the contract; can say that the contract alleged is not the contract which he made; that he made a con-tract with conditions, whereas the one alleged is abso-lute. It would seem, on principle, that this reason is as strong in the case of conditions subsequent as con-ditions precedent, and it is submitted that the weight of authority decidedly supports this view.4 1 Lawes, Pleading in Aswmpsit, p. 35.

The pos-session by A of such right was a condition precedent to A's ability to perform and to X's liability.1 (b). A denial of the breach on the defendant's part.2 (b). Action of General Assumpsit. § 208. The general issue in this form of assumpsit, as in special assumpsit, is non assumpsit. The theory of the action of general assumpsit is the same as that of special assumpsit; namely, recovery on a promise contained in a contract. The scope of the plea is, th~refore, the same,-i. e., it denies the con-tract. And, since the contract in this form of action is made up of a debt, which is deemed the considera-tion, and an implied promise, the effect of non assump-sit is to deny both the debt and the implied promise. § 209. Hence, under the general issue, the defend-ant may show that the facts were not such as to con-stitute a debt, or that th~ law has never raised an im-plied promise. The latter is the case where goods were sold, or work done, on a credit which has not expired, and also where there has been a special contract with certain conditions, which have not been complied with by the plaintiff. iDe Pinna \".

The only occasion for the use of a specific traverse as a plea to a declaration in general assumpsit is in denial of the breach, and in such case, it is con-ceived, a denial of the breach would amount to a plea of payment. This results from the fact that the only promise which the law will imply is one for the pay-ment of money, and it is upon such a promise that the action is always based. 1 Bussey f.l.

The general issue in the action of debt was originally nil debet, but after the Hilary Rules was nunquam indebitatus. Its effect is simply to deny the debt. Under the general issue the defendant may show payment made on delivery, for, in that case, it is held no debt ever arises. 1 But where the defendant relies on credit not expired, or conditions not performed by the plaintift, he cannot show them under nunquam indebitatus, but must plead in excuse. A v. X. Action of Debt for goods sold. Plea, nun-quam indebitatus. X wishes to show that the goods were sold on credit and that the credit has not expired. He should have pleaded it affirmatively, i. e., in excuse; for a debt arises the moment the goods are delivered. § 212. Though the breach is a necessary allega-tion in a declaration in debt on simple contract, it is a point of form only and cannot be traversed by the defendant. It would seem, therefore, that in this action no room is left for a specific traverse to the declaration.z 1 Bussey v. Barnett, 9 M. & W. 312; Ames' Cases, 98. While this action was brought in the form of generaZ assumpsit, it is authority for the point, that where goods are paid for on deliv-ery no debt arises', hence, if the action had bl'l'n in debt, and the defense was payment on delivery, the general issue, i. e., ,,_ quam indebitatus, would have been the proper plea.. 2 Goodchild v.

It has been seen that the action of trespass may be brought either for injury to the plaintiff's per-son or his property. 1 If brought for injury to the plaintiff's person, there seems to be no room for a specific traverse to the decla-ration. The acts of the defeIl:dant are the only neces-sary allegations in point of substance, and the general issue covers them. § 217. Where the action is for injury to the plain-tiff's property, personal or real, the allegation· of pos-session is necessary, and the specific traverse is used to deny the plaintiff's possession of the goods or close, as the case may be; being usually called U not possessed\" in the former case and « not the close of the plaintiff\" in the latter. These traverses deny simply the pos-session of the plaintiff, not his right of possession. This is so because actual possession is sufficient to maintain the action. A v. X. Action of trespass for injury to A's horse. Plea, that A was not possessed of the horse. X cannot show, under this plea, that the horse was a borrowed horse at the time of the injury to it. A v. X.

In an action of trespass for loss of service (see ante~ p. 36), since the allegation of the relation of master and servant corresponded to that of possession where the injury complained of was to the plaintiff's goods, i. e.~ since it was matter of inaucement, if the defendant wished. to show that the relation did not exist,.it was necessary for him to traverse it specifically. A 'V. X. Action of trespass for injury to A's servant, M, whereby he lost her service. Plea, that M was not the servant of A. Special demurrer, assigning for cause that the plea amounts to not guilty. The plea is good; the matter could not be shown under not guilty~ which denies merely the act of injury.l upon whioh Jones t1. Chapman and similar cases may be sup-ported is as follows: the moment the rightful owner, in person or by a servant, enters upon the land, the actual possession revests, and the plaintiff becomes a mere trespaaser. Hence the defendant, in showing his right of possession or that of his master, is virtually denying the plaintiff's actual possession. The fallacy of this reasoning is that it proceeds upon the idea that any act, however trifling, will amount to an entry and revest the possession in the defendant. But an entry is an act of some magnitude, and while any act, be it the stretching of an arm over, or the stepping of one foot on the land, is a trespass, such act will not amount to a common·law entry. Until, therefore, the act is of sufficient magnitude to constitute an entry, posses· sion will not revest, and showing that the defendant entered as rightful owner does not deny the plaintiff's pOssession at the time of the trespass. Hence, while a good defense under liberum tenementum, it cannot be shown under flot possessed. \"The only way to avoid this conclusion is to adopt the doctrine of relation and say that the entry, and hence the revesting, relates back to the time of the first act. But will the court adopt a fiction for the mere purpose of allowing the defendant to plead a certain 80rt of pIe')'? 1 Torrence t1. Gibbons, 5 Q. B. 297; Ames' Cases, 100.

Its effect is to deny the wrongful act alleged as a conversion; i. e., it not only denies the act, but also that it was wrongful. It will be ooserved that all mat-ters which, if the form. of action were trespass, would be properly pleaded by a plea in excuse, may in the action of trover be shown as evidence under the plea not guilty. A v. X. Action of trover. Plea, not guilty. X may show that he took the goods, as sheriff, under a writ. 1 A v. X. Action of trover against X as bailee of A's goods.

The plea of not guilty does not deny (and, not deny-ing, impliedly admits) the allegation of actuaZ pos-session or right of p088ession, whichever the plaintiff may have seen fit to rely upon in his declaration. A 'V. X. Action of trover. Plea, not gut,tty. X cannot show a lien upon the goods, nor that A stole the goods from M, nor that A held the goods as bailee for X. These are all matters affecting possession or right of possession. § 221. The important specific traverse to the dela-ration in trover is not possessed, which has the double effect of denying either the posession or right of pos-session, accordingly as the plaintiff relies on the one or the other. This is obviously just, since the defendant cannot ~ell upon which the plaintiff intends to rely-until evi-dence is introduced. The allegation of the possession in the declaration is usually in such terms that either actual p088ession or right of p088ession, if proved, will support it. § 222. Anything affecting the plainti.ff's possession or right of possession must be shown under not pos-sessed, as, for example, a lien. A 'V. X. Action of trover for a certain deed. Plea, not possessed. X may show that A deposited the deed with him as security for money advanced, and that the money has not been paid back. 1 1 Owen fl. Knight, 4 Bing. N. C. 54; Ames' Cases, 105; White fl. Teale, 9 L.

Action of trover, alleging that X, as bailee, refused to give the goods up. Plea, not possessed. X may show that A never bailed the goods to him or that A has no right over them, but cannot show that he, X, did not refuse to give the goods up. § 224. In those cases where the plaintiff can prove actual possession, and the defendant has some good ex-cuse for the taking of the goods, it would seem· to be necessary for him to plead both not possessed and not guilty in order to protect himself fully, as the following illustration will show. A 'I). X. Action of trover. X wishes to show that :M stole the goods from him and gave them to A, and he, X, took them from A. A may rely upon his actual possession. If he does, X could not support a plea of not possessed, and he would have no other defense, since not possessed admits the wrongful act alleged as a con-version. Not guilty would be necessary then, in order that X might show that the taking was not wrongful, if A relies upon actual possession. But if X pleads not guilty alone, A would immediately conclude to rely upon his right of possession, which X could not dispute, since not guilty admits the plaintiff's possession or right of possession, as he chooses to .rely upon the one or the other. § 225.

It has already been seen I that in the action of Replevin, if the defendant claims that the seizure of the chattels was a rightful one, his answer to the declaration is in the nature of a cross-declaration, and is called an avowry or cognizance. . If, however, he does not wish to justify the seizure, but to deny it, his answer to the declaration takes the ordinary form of a plea. In Replevin, as in the other forms of action, there is what is known as the general issue. It is called non cepit, and its effect is to deny the actual taking in tke place alleged, and to construc-tively admit the plaintiff's possession. A v. X. Action of replevin. Plea, non cepit. X cannot show that the goods did not belong to A, for non cepit does not put the ownership of the property in issue. If A proves an actual seizure of the goods by X, it is sufficient, and no proof of property or pos-session need be given.2 § 229. Under the plea of non cepit, the defendant may show, not only that he did not take the goods, but also that he did not take them in tke place alleged. This is because the allegation of the place of the seizure is an essential part of the wrongful act which is the basis of the action.3 § 230.

The pleading by which the plaintiff answers the avowry or cognizance is called a plea. This he must frame, of course, according to the nature of his case. When the' defendant has distrained for rent, and, in his avowry, has alleged the lease to the plaintiff and rent in arrear, the traverse rien en arrere (nothing in arrear) denies simply that rent is due, admitting the lease to be as the defendant has alleged. Hence, if the defendant has alleged rent payable quarterly, the plaintiff cannot, under this traverse, show that it was payable half-yearly. A v. X. Action of replevin. X, in his avowry, alleges a lease to A, in which rent is payable quarterly, and alleges rent in arrear. Plea, no rent in arrear. A cannot show that the rent was payable half-yearly; the traverse impliedly admits the lease in the terms stated. 1 § 231. Specific traverses to the declaration are un-usual, though not impossible, in the action of replevin; the reason is, that the defendant usually not only wishes to defend himself, but also to get a return of the goods, and to do the latter he must put in an avowry or cog-nizance. § 232. To the avowry or cognizance specific trav-erses are common, and take their usual place among other pleas, being used wherever the plaintiff wishes to deny some single material allegation. The plea rien en arrere, above mentioned, though sometimes regarded 1 Bill tI. Wright, 2 Esp. 669; Ames' Cases, 113.

(h). Action of Case. § 233. The general issue, in actions on the case, takes the form of not guilty. It operates \" as a denial only of the breach of duty or wrongful act alleged to have been committed by the defendant, and not of the . facts stated in the inducement.\" The matters which form the inducement are those which show the plaintiff's right with respect to the subject of the action, the right of which he claims the defendant's act is a violation. Such matter is not denied by the plea not guilty. A fJ. X. Action of case. Declaration alleges A was entitled to be taxed, and that X wrongfully omitted to insert her name in the tax list, which prevented her from getting a license to sell beer. Plea, that A was not entitled to be assessed. Under this plea A does not have to show that she was prevented from ·obtaining a license by X's act,-i. e., that it was wrongful,-in order to recover. In order to put this in issue, X should have pleaded not guilty. 1 § 234. In the aclion of Case, as in that of trover, since wrongfulness is the essence of the act complained of, matters which show that the act is justifiable may be shown under not guilty; but matters in excuse which may be shown under not guilty are only such as tend to 1 Perring tI.

Hence, here, as in trover, matters in excuse must be carefully distinguished from matters denying the plainti:ff'~ right as it is set forth in the inducement. § 236. (1). Thus in case for wrongfully diverting water, not guilty does not put in issue the plaintiff's right to have the water flow to his mill. A fJ. X. Action of case. Declaration alleges A is possessed of a mill and has a right to the water of a cer-tain stream; that X wrongfully diverted the water away from the mill. Plea, not guilty. A proves the act of diverting the water, but does not show a right to use it. A need not prove his right. It is a part of the inducement and not guilty admits it.1 § 236. (2). In case for the defendant's dogs injur-ing the plaintiff's cattle, the scienter -knowledge on the defendant's part of the ferocious character of his dogs -is put in issue by not guilty, since it is no part of the inducement, but one of the elements of the wrongful act on the defendant's part. A fJ. X. Action of case. Declaration alleges X wrongfully kept dogs, knowing them to be ferocious; which dogs killed A's cattle. Plea, not guilty.

In case for libel, not gut-tty seems to deny not only all material allegations in the declara-tion, but to go even further, and, upon the theory that the declaration negatives every excuse, it is allowable, under this plea, to show that the defendant had some excuse for the act, as that it was a privileged commu-nication. But there is one material allegation, that of falsity, which, under the rule which has grown up, is admitted, and cannot be negatived by the plea of not guilty.

SECTION IV.-SPECIAL TRAVERSES. § 243. The object of the special traverse was to enable the party putting it in to place upon the record, and thus bring directly before the court, facts which otherwise he could not have brought in at all, or, at least, not until he introduced them. as evidence.1 To accomplish this object the special traverse con-sists of two parts: (1) What is known as the induce-ment; (2) what is commonly called the absque hoc clause. § 244. (1). Heretofore the word inducement has been used as designating a part of the declaration. What is known as the inducement of the special traverse is a different thing. As a part of the special traverse, the inducement is the means by which the object of the traverse is accomplished. It is in its nature an indirect denial; i. e., a denial by means of introducing new facts which necessarily contradict the allegations in the pleading of the opposite party. This, however, by itself would violate the rule that a traverse must be direct in its terms. To remedy this, or, as it is some-times expressed, \"to cure the argumentativeness of the inducement,\" it is necessary to add the second part of the special traverse, namely: 1 For a good illustration of the proper use of a special traverse, Me Beckham 1).

X, as administrator of J. S. A brings a writ of scire facias against X. X pleads that before admin-istration granted to A, administration was granted to J. N., who is still alive. A replies that J. N. died. Special demurrer. Plea, argumentative as it stands. An absque hoc clause, namely, U absque hoc that J. N. is still alive,\" would have cured it. Illustrates well the subtle niceness of the old pleading.1 The words absque hoc quod, however, are not abso-lutely necessary to a special traverse; et non will do;2 § 246. The special traverse, it seems, originally concluded with a verification on account of the new affirmative matter which it contained; but since the Hilary Rules (1834)3 it must conclude to the country, i. e., tender issue. § 247. If, then, the special traverse is good in all its parts, and tenders issue properly, or though the inducement is bad in substance or form, if the absque hoc clause is good, it cannot be pleaded to; the oppos-ing party irlUSt either join issue or demur.

A's replication would have been bad on special demurrer, because the inducement con-tains matter entirely irrelevant, and does not deny, indirectly, the same thing which the absque hoc claus(> denies directly; (matter in the inducement immaterial, because the entry of another, by command of the land-lord, terminates a lease at will). Instead of joining issue or demurring, X pleads in his turn a special traverse, thus violating the rule that there can be no traverse upon a traverse. Hence, on demurrer, A will have judgment.1 • § 248.

Judgment for X.l § 249. The inducement must always be of the nature of an indirect denial. If direct, there is no room left for the absque hoc clause.

The declaration alleges that M was seised in fee of the land in 1716, and then leased to X with covenant to pay rent; that X entered and continued possessed; that M assigned the reversion to A; that rent is due. Plea, that one J.

Special demurrer. The plea is bad, because the inducement contains matter in confession and avoidance; namely, that M's (the landlord's) estate had determined, as well as an indirect denial of the title.1 § 251. The second part of the special traverse, namely, the absque hoc clause, must always be in the form of a direct denial, for it is this clause which is supposed to cure the indirectness of the first part. In addition to this it must deny directly the same matter denied indirectly by the inducement. . 1 Palmer 11. Ekins, 2 Ld. R'm'd, 1550; Ames' Cases, 136.

SEOTION V.-REPLICATION DE INJURIA. § 266. The replication de injuria is a traverse of more general nature than the specific traverse, being used to deny, in general terms, the defendant's plea. Its fuller form is de injuria 81J.a propria absque tali ca1J.8a (of his own wrong without such cause). AB its name indicates, this traverse can only be used by the plaintiff as a replication.2 Under the common-law system of pleading, a defend-ant could put in but one plea to the declaration of the plaintiff. A statute passed in the time of Anne (4 Anne, c. xvi., § 1) provided that the defendant might, \"with the leave of the same court, plead as many sev~ eral matters thereto as he shall think necessary for his defense.\" To meet this added advantage given to the defendant, the replication de injuria WI\\.S originated, by which the plaintiff, in certain forms of action and in certain cases, was allowed to put in issue several mate-rial allegatioris in the defendant's plea. § 256. The forms of action to which this replica-tion was confined were trespass, trespass on the case, 1 Hom fl.

Again, the use of the repli-cation in these forms of action was limited to cases where the plea consisted of a plea by way of confession and avoidance in excuse. Where the plea was the gen-eral issue, a specific traverse, or a plea by way of confession and avoidance in discharge, the replication could not be used. A 'V. X. Action of trespass for seizing salt. X in his plea sets forth an act laying a duty on salt, and alleges that the salt was about to be exported without being weighed, and he (X) seized it, as an officer. Replication de injuria.

One of the m~in objects of the system of pleading which prevailed at common law was to pre-sent the case to the jury in as simple a form as possible. The idea was that the minds of the jury must not be perplexed by numerous issues, but that the case must go before them upon a single question of fact. The rule against duplicity was one of the means by which this end was accomplished. It was held that a pleading was ,defective which was double -i. e., which con-tained more than a single cause of action or defense. 1 Where a declaration stated two or more distinct grounds to support the same claim, or where a plea, replication, or rejoinder contained two or more distinct answers to the matter alleged in the preceding pleading, the rule against duplicity was violated. The defect could be taken advantage of by a special demurrer. A v. X. Action of assumpsit. The declaration alleges an agreement by X to pay one hundred dollars_ for a horse, in consideration of A's agreement to sell it to him, with alternative conditions, either that -the horse should be delivered by such a day, or that A should break him to harness.

Condition, the payment by X of a certain sum at two fixed days. Plea, that X paid accordingly. Replication, that X has not paid accordingly.

The declaration alleges X was the drawer of a bill of ex-change on M; that A was the holder; that the bill was presented for acceptance, and dishonored; that the bill was presented later for payment, and dishon-ored; of all of which X had notice; and, in consider-ation of the premises, promised to pay A the amount of the bill on request. Special demurrer, for duplicity. The declaration was held good. On the view that the liability of the drawer arises absolutely upon the first . dishonor, it would seem that the declaration is double; for, then, either dishonor without the other would furnish a ground for the implied promise.3 1 Anon., Brooke's Abr., Title, Double Plea, pI. 90; Ames' Cases, 185.

Special demurrer, for duplicity. The plea is good. It amounts simply to a plea of infancy.! § 263. As a rule of common-law pleading this rule against duplicity, it is conceived, is without exception. It has been said 2 that a defense pleaded as a \"necessary inducement\" to another defense will not operate to make a pleading double. There is no foundation for this alleged exception. Dame Audley's case,J which is cited as the authority for it, does not support it. The case was one of detinue brought by Dame Audley, a married woman; the defendant pleaded the marriage of the plaintiff to Lord Andley after the bailment, and a release by him. In no case could this matter constitute more than a single defense; for-(a). If the detainer took place after the marriage, the marriage was a complete and the only defense; the allegation of release was inimaterial as against the p~aintiff; for, upon marriage, the property in the goods passed to the husband, and no right of action ever vested in the plaintiff. (b). If the detainer took place before marriage, the marriage itself was no defense, since, at the time of the marriage, Dame Audley possessed simply a chose 1 Harrison 11.

The release; therefore, was the only defense. It will be seen, therefore, that in no case can the plea amount to more than a single defense, and there is no ground for the alleged exception. § 284. It is sometimes stated that a replication containing two distinct averments will not be bad for duplicity if the defendant cannot tender issue upon both without departing from his plea, thus seemingly presenting an exception to the general rule. The fact is, however, that in such a case one of the averments will always be mere su!plusage, and the replication could thus in no way be double. A 11. X. Action of debt on a bond.

Replication denies (1) that the cattle were X's own cattle; (2) that they were levant and couchant; (3) that they were commonable cattle. Special de-murrer, for duplicity. The replication is good; the allegations that the cattle were X's cattle, levant and couchant, etc., are unnecessary, as they are implied in the allegation of common ability ; hence the denials of them in the replication are mere surplusage; the denial of ~ommonability is sufficient.2 A 11.

Plea in abatement, that the writ\" at the time it was put into the officer's hands for service, and at the time when it was served, con-tained no count or declaration.\" Special demurrer, for duplicity.

The plea is double; the second part is a separate defense; it is ill-pleaded, as it amounts to non assumpsit.

The plea is a departure from the declaration, which treated the lime-kiln as a chattel, and is bad on that account.2 A 11. X. Action of debt on a bond.

The rejoinder is a departure from the plea, and bad on that account.3 § 271. Departure is a fault which may be taken advantage of on general demurrer. Where the departure is from the declaration, i. e., in the replication, it seems proper to regard it as a de-fect in substance; for, if the plaintiff recovers at all, he must always recover on the cause of action as stated in the declaration. When, therefore, he abandons his declaration and states a new cause of action in the replication, it is evident judgment cannot be given for 1 Richards 11.

When, however, the departure is from the plea, i. e., in the rejoinder, there seems to be no valid reason for holding the defendant's pleadings bad on general demurrer; no reason, in fact, why the defend-ant should not answer the matter in the replication by a new defense. However, the rule is well settled that, if he does, the rejoinder will be bad on general de-murrer, although, if a defect at all, it is obviously but a fault in form. § 273. Where the declaration is made up wholly of irrelevant matter, and discloses no cause of action, a replication stating a good cause of action will be a departure. A v. X. Action of assumpsit. The declaration alleges that X promised to give A $100, and states as a breach that he did not give it, but states no consid-eration. Plea, that X was an infant when he made the promise. Replication, that X made the promise in consideration that A would furnish him with meat and groceries, and that A had furnished them. De-murrer.

There is really no departure in such a case, for there is no abandoning of a previous ground. The true reason why judgment goes against the plain-tiff is that no cause of action has been stated in his declaration, and it is, therefore, bad on general de-murrer, whether that demurrer comes after the decla-ration or after the replication . . § 274. Where the declaration is framed in con-tract, and the replication sets forth matter which might sustain an action of tort, there is a departure. A v. X. Action of debt for goods sold and deliv-ered. Plea, that X was an infant at the time of con-tracting the debt. Replication, that X fraudulently represented to A that he was of full age, and thereby obtained the goods. Demurrer. The replication is a departure from the declaration; it discloses matter for an action of tort. 1 § 275. Where the plaintiff relies upon a common-law right, and the defendant sets up a prima facie de-fense,-e. g., act of Parliament,-the plaintiff can, of course, reply any matters which tend to remove the defense, and support his claim on the ground taken in the declaration.

The rule which required a new assignment in certain cases was another of the rules of common-law pleading directed to the simplification of the issues. Where the plaintiff's declaration was framed in terms so general, that the defendant might presumably be in some doubt as to the plaintiff's cause of complaint, he was permitted to misconceive (though in legal con-templation unwittingly) the claim of the plaintiff, and to apply his plea to a different matter from that which the plaintiff had in view; the plaintiff was then com-pelled to new assign -i. e., state more definitely his cause of complaint. An able treatment of new assign-ment will be found in Justice Blackstone's opinion in the case of Martin v. Kesterton.1 § 279. A new assignment can be used only by the plaintiff, and by him only in his replication. It is in the nature of a new declaration, stating that the de-fendant has not, in his plea, rightly understood, or answered to, the cause of action which the plaintiff meant to urge, and stating in more definite terms just what that cause of action is. The pleadings then pro-ceed as if there had been no such misunderstanding between the parties 12 Bl. 1089; Ames' Cases, 2(34.

Action of trespass for breaking and enter-Ing A's house. Plea, that M held a house under lease from X; that a year's rent was in arrear; that, to prevent X from distraining, M carried his goods to A's house; that X entered under a search warrant. Repli-cation, new assignment that A declares for a trespass upon another and different part of the day. X pleads the same defense as before. Replication, de injuria. X proves that he entered as stated in the plea, but gives no proof of the lease to M, nor of rent in arrears, claim-ing these facts are admitted by the new assignment. X must prove these facts the same as if there had been no new assignment. 1 § 281.

A replied that X had discharged him from such forfeiture, and new assigned that £7 of the £10 became due after said drunkenness. There was a spe~ial demurrer for du-plicity. Held, that the replication was good, the new assignment being proper. It would seem, however, that the new assignment amounts simply to a traverse, as to £7, of the forfeiture mentioned in the plea, and hence is bad in form; but since the replication of dis-charge must be construed as applying only to the re-maining £3, there is no duplicity in the replication. 1 Huddart v.

KOTIONS BASED ON THE PLEADINGS. SECTION 1.-ARREST OF J UOOKENT. § 288. It often happens that a verdict is found for the plaintiff on pleadings which the defendant thinks insufficient in substance. It being too late to bring the question of their validity before the court by demurrer, the means adopted by the defendant to accomplish the same object is what is known as a mo-tion in arrest of judgment. Like a demurrer, such a motion opens the whole record; and, if it appears on its face that the pleadings of the plaintiff are bad in substance, judgment will be arrested. A v. X. A alleges in his declaration that X prom-ised to sell and deliver to A 266 hogsheads of tobacco at a certain price if A would agree to purchase them and would give notice thereof to the defendant before the hour of four in the afternoon; that A did agree to purchase and gave notice before four o'clock. After verdict for A, X moved in arrest of judgment on the ground the declaration stated no consideration. The declaration is bad in substance, as the promise alleged as the consideration is subsequent in time to the promise of X, and judgment will be arrested.1 § 289. Where a defect in substance is cured by allegations in the answering pleading, the action of the 1 Cooke v. Oxley, 3 D. & E. 653; Livingston v. Rogers, 1 Caines, 683.

MOTIONS BASED ON THE PLEADINGS. 185 court will be the same on motion in arrest of judgment. as it would be on demurr~r -i. e., it will refuse to allow advantage to be taken of the defect, and judgment will not be arrested. A v. X. Action of trespass. The declaration al-leges the taking of a hook, but does not say A's hook, nor that it was in A's possession. Plea, that X had a right of way over A's land; that he was passing there, and took the hook out of A's hands to prevent A from injuring him. Replication, traVElrse of the right of way. Issue joined. Verdict for 1'J... J udg-ment will not be arrested, for the omission to allege possession is cured by the allegation in the plea.1 . . § 290. Formerly, it was customary to arrest judg-ment on a merely fornw.l defect; but, since the various statutes, known as statutes of jeofails, some error in substance must appear. When judgment is arrested, the case stops where it is, each party pays his own costs, and the plaintiff, if he wishes to prosecute the suit, must begin anew. § 291. Where the declaration contains several counts, some of which are bad in substance, while others present a sufficient cause of action, and the jury give a general verdict, with general damages, for the plaintiff, a motion in arrest of judgment will not. be granted. . In such case the plaintiff is entitled to judg-ment on the good counts, and the error is one that the jury have made in not specifying upon what counts the verdict was given. It is not just, therefore, to 1 Brooke fl. Brooke, Sider1iD, 184; Ames' CaseB, 266.

A venire de novo, which simply summons a new jury, will, however, be awarded\"! § 292. Where the plaintiff in his replication trav-erses an immaterial point in the plea, and, upon issue being taken thereon, obtains a verdict, judgment will not be arrested, but a repleader will be awarded. There is no reason, on principle, why, in such a case, judgment should not be arrested. The reason given is that the plaintiff may have a better answer to the plea, and ought to have a chance to bring it forward. But, if the traverse had been demurred to, judgment would have been ~iven for the defendant -without regard to any better answer which the plain-tiff m~ght have; and why, in the case of arrest of judg-ment, should such a consideration come in ~ The fact that the plaintiff did not bring forward a better answer to the plea is, -in the eyes ?f the law, a sufficient acknowledgment that he has none.

Plea, that A and M were partners; that with A's consent M dealt with certain goods as his own property; that the goods were left with X to be sold; that it was agreed between M and X that X, out of the proceeds, should reimburse himself for money lent to Yo Replication, traversing that A permitted M to deal with the property as his own.

In general, errors in form are no ground for arresting judgment. There is one case, however, which stands upon a peculiar footing. This is the action of debt on a bond conditioned for the perform-ance of an award. Where the plea is in excuse, \"No award made,\" and the replication sets forth an award, but assigns no breach, the replication is defective. 1 It has been shown that the assignment of a breach is necessary in the replication. Now, whether it be said that its omission is a defect in substance, or merely in form, it certainly can be taken advantage of on a motion in arrest of judgment. If it be regarded as an error in substance, it causes no exception to the rule that judgment will be arrested only for an error in sub-stance; but it certainly is rather an anomalous state of affairs to say that an allegation which cannot be trav-ersed is matter of substance. If it be regarded as an error in form, it causes a most striking exception to the rule above stated. SECTION II.-NON-OBSTANTE VEREDICTO. § 294. Where a party thinks that, on the plead-ings, he is entitled to immediate judgment, though a verdict has been given for his opponent, he moves for judgment nO'flrobstante veredicto (llotwithstanding the verdict). § 296. The cases show the motion to have been made almost universally by the plaintiff; but it is 1 Barrett tI. Fletcher, Cro. Jac. 220; Ames' Cases, 265. Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"188 PRINCIPLES OF COllllON-LAW PLEADING. probable that either party may obtain judgment n01lr-obstante. 1 There certainly seems to be no good reason why, if the defendant has set forth a good defense, and the plaintiff's replication confesses, but does not avoid it, he should not have judgment non-obstante. If either party may have judgment non-obstante, there seems to be no occasion for the motion in arrest of judgment; for the defendant has a much better expedient in the motion for judgment noflrobstante. § 296. The idea which gave rise to this motion was that, where the defendant confessed the plaintiff's cause of action, and gave no sufficient avoidance, there, whatever immaterial issue may have been joined and found for the defendant, the plaintiff was entitled in justice to the judgme~t. A '/.I. X. Action of case for slander. Plea, con-fesses the speaking of the words, and alleges an insuf-ficient excuse. Replication, traverses the excuse. Verdict for A. X moves for an arrest of judgment. Though the traverse is immaterial, judgment will not be arrested, but will be for A on the confession in X's plea.2 § 297. The motion was originally granted only where the defendant expressly confessed, in the plea upon which the plaintiff sought judgment non-obstante, the plaintiff's cause of action, and gave no good avoidance. 1 14 Am.

Ver-dict. for X. A is entitled to judgment non-obstante 11eredicto. The king is not subject to .the statute of limitations, and X has not alleged that six years have expired, exclusive of the time the king held the note.1 § 298. The scope of the motion was gradually extended to embrace those cases where the defendant, in anyone of his pleas, confessed the cause of action, though there was no express confession in the plea upon which verdict had been given for the defendant, and upon which the plaintiff sought judgment non-obstante. A 11. X. Action of case for libel. X pleads several pleas setting up the truth as a justification. Replica-tion, de injuria. Verdict for A on one plea and for X on the rest, but the issues on the latter were imma-terial. Though some of the pleas did not confess the cause of action, A is entitled to judgment non-obstante upon these pleas, since the plea which raised a material issue and upon which verdict was in his favor was a sufficient confession.2 § 299. Then to cases where the plaintiff had ob-tained the verdict on some material traverse, while the defendant had succeeded on the immaterial issue. ·1 Lambert o.

Plea, several traverses of material matter upon which A had a verdict, and a traverse that A had a good catl8e of action (conclusion of law), upon which X had a verdict. A is entitled to judgment .non-obstante.1 § 300. On principle, the courts should have gone one step farther, and given judgment non-obstante 'Veredicto, where there was a single immaterial traverse to the declaration upon which the defendant had ob-tained a verdict; for, what a party does not deny, he admits; and therefore, on the face of the pleadings, the action stands confessed, with no good avoidance. But the courts refused to take this final step.2 SECTION III.-REPLEADER. § 301. Where the parties proceeded to trial upon some immaterial point raised by the form of the plead-ings, and a verdict of the jury upon such point was had, the court was unable to award judgment for either party. The merits of the controversy were still unde-termined. To remedy the situation the court awarded what was called a repleader.3 1 Couling 11.

X, as executor. Assumpsit. A alleges the testator promised, etc. X pleads that he (the executor) made no such promise. On issue joined, the verdict is for X. Repleader will be awarded, as the verdict is upon an immaterial issue.1 § 302. Either party may move that a repleader be awarded, or the court may award it without motion. If awarded, its effect is to compel the parties to begin their pleadings anew at the stage where the first imma-terial pleading was placed on the record, and each party pays his own costs.2 A repleader will be awarded only after verdict, and then ony in certain cases where the parties have gone to trial on an imma-terial issue; i. e., not in all cases of immaterial issue. Two further illustrations may be given where the relief was considered proper. A. 11. X. Action of debt for rent. Plea, that before the rent became due X assigned the term to ]\\f, of which A had notice. Replication, traversing notice. Verdict for X. Repleader awarded. The issue of notice is immaterial. Nothing discharges X except an agreement by A to the assignment. It would seem that A was entitled to judgment non-obstante veredicto had he moved it, unless the plea stated such agreement.3 A v. X.

Repleader awarded because the issue was imma-terial Payment before the day would have been a performance of the condition. 1 § 302. When it is said that repleader will not be awarded in every case of immaterial issue, it is meant, to quote from Lord Mansfield's opinion, \"that when the finding upon it does not determine tke rigkt the court ought to award a repleader, unless it appears from the whole record that no manner of pleading the matter could have availed.\" 2 § 303. The courts will be very sure that the issue is immaterial before awarding a repleader. A 'V. X. Action of trespass quare clausum fregitl and for taking three cows. Plea, that X leased the close to :H, and entered and took the cows as a distress for rent in arrear. Replication, traversing that the cows were levant and couchant. Verdict for A. A repleader will not be granted, for levancy and cou-chancy might be material if X chased the cows on to the land liable to his distress, for then he ('ould only take them damage-feasant, and levancy and couchancy would be materiaJ.3 § 304. It is qifficult to understand what occasion either party had for moving for a repleader, since it would seem (on principle, at least) that a better expe-dient was always open to him.

If we adopt Chief Justice Tindal's view that\" a repleader is rather the act of the COUrll where it sees that justice cannot be done without adopting that course,\" 1 we can easily conceive of the courts, in two other cases (see starred cases above), awarding a repleader on the ground that the party may have a better defense. 1 Gordon \".
