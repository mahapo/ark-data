As I summurized in the slides at the end of this paper h e refered in several of his intervie w s, publications and patents that such a cos mic energy source really exists. Several other inventors resp. « Tesla followers » have tried and sometimes succeeded to build systems inclu ding a storage device like a battery which allows to produce continually electrical energy. T here exist also theoretical papers to the possibility to convert energy from the vacuum field like that of Tom Bearden , Lawrence Tesung , Prof. Claus Turtur et.al. Links to practical implementations : 0. Carlos F. Benitez http://www.borderlands.de/Links/GB121561A.pdf The inventor , a civil engineer of Guadalajar, Mexico, invented a method to produce electri - cal energy by charging and discharging batteries alternatively . The discharging battery is con nected to a load and delivers a part o f the energy to an oscillatory circuit provi ded with a rectifier which sends the high frequency pulses through the second battery from the posi - tive to the negative pole. It was found that this second battery can be charged in this man - ner complety in the time lapse of time in wich the first battery discharges . Therefor e it is only a question of reversion the connection s of said batteries from time to time and to rep e at the prodecure. A method to realize this switching is described In GB121,561 which was completely accepted on Dec 24, 1918 . In his base patent application 14,311, see : http://potentialtec.com/GB191514311A.pdf , it is claimed : "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 The basic circuit as printed in the patent application No 14,311 (GB) is reproduced here : "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=q1FyajzU3So 8 :17 (2.11 :58) Rick Friedrich ex plains in this video how the inven - tion of Carlos F. Benitez really worked. Two serially con nec ted batteries 1+2 with together 24 V are fed via some loads to two pa - ral lely connec ted batteries 3+4 (12 V) which are char - ged at the same time by the flowing current. After some time the char ging and loading bat ter ies are inter chan ged so that bat - tery 3+4 are serially con - nected and batteries 1+2 are parallely connected. And the current is flowing now from battery 3+4 (24 V) via the load to battery 1+2 (12 V). Important is the oscillatory circuit (below) which all ows a faster and more effective charging of the batteries. Originally Carlos F. Benitez used capacitors instead of batteries , see at time 34 :50 in the link given above. Also in this configuration the inventor emphasizes the need of an oscillatory circuit compo - sed by a condensor, coils and a breaker . Evidently in this way it is possible to use resonance energy for recharging the parallel ly connected right batteries from the serially connected two left batteries completely and to use so me remaining additonal energy for ext ernal loads (lamps connected to line 36 , see on the right ). This load is transformed via transfor - mer windings to left part (noted with 5) as a serial load to the left conden ser. Much more can be learned by consulting the different videos of Rich Friedrich which can be seen on the link mentioned above. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 1. Ronald Brandt/Bedini converter https://www.greenoptimistic.com/john - bedinis - cigar - box - sized - tesla - switch - how - to - build - it - 20080206/#.Wlm2za7iaM9 At the Tes la Centennial Sym posium in Colorado Springs, CO, on August, 11, 1984 , John Bedini demonstrated an inex pensive, cigar - box sized Tesla - type converter witch he had recently built. Throughout the demonstra tion, which lasted a full 24 hours during the sym po sium, a constant load was being drawn out of the system to do work, Nevertheless, the converter kept the nickel - cad mium batteries fully charged! The concept, witch had been origina ted by Nikola Tesla , was given to John Bedini by Ro nald Brandt, who was a per sonal friend of Nikola Tesla. Brandt is reputed to have a similar con - ver ter which he has used for years without loo sing the battery charge. Bedini presented the schematic diagram showing how to build the solid - state device, and then released c opies of the schematic diagram. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 https://www.greenoptimistic.com/build - tesla - 4 - battery - switch#.Wlm3_a7iaM9 Tesla used the fact that lead ions are heavier th an electrons. Every circuit, in it transitory phase (from zero - volt to x volts) develops a much higher voltage applied on the negative side. This voltage (pile - up of electrons meeting the much heavier lead ions) is then normally distributed in the circuit. If you cut off the load and the source battery , all the voltage made by the electrons gathered at the negative side of the battery you want to charge, go in that battery. If you do that from 200 to 800 times per second , you can charge the destination battery (lead - acid) in a very short time (tens of minutes). By switching the batteries bet ween them, you restart the process and reload the source battery. Remark : According to Rick Friedrich it was found that such fast switching stresses t he plates in the batteries to much which can result in batteries breack down. There is a company ( Electrodyne Corporation ) who tested this ensemblement and for three years they fueled many devices, with no unusual damage to the batteries . According to the link : http://www.free - energy - info.co.uk/Chapt6.html He re you can read: ... The Electrodyne Corp. staff who experimented extensively with the Tesla Switch circuitry, found that when a battery was fully conditioned to used cold electricity , that a battery could b e disconnected, discharged independently to it’s full capacity, and then re - charged completely in under one minute. That style of operation completely overcomes the objections to using battery banks to power household equipment of any power ....

However , IF WE CHOOSE, WE CAN ARRANGE OUR CHARGING CIRCUIT TO DO THIS SWITCH - ON STYLE OF CHARGING THOUSANDS OF TIMES EACH SE COND . FOR EXAMPLE, LAWRENCE TSEUNG PRODUCED A CHARGING SYSTEM WHICH IS A MODIFIED JOULE THIEF CIRCUIT AND HE STATES THAT IT IS TEN TI MES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OR - DI NARY CHAR GING , see : http://www.free - energy - info.com/FLEET.pdf THE CIRCUIT IS CALLED THE F.L.E.E.T.

IN REALITY, THE OUTER WINDING IS MADE WITH EXACTLY THE SAME WIRE AS THE INNER WINDING . BOTH WINDING S GO ALL OF THE WAY AROUND THE TOROID.

AT AN EARLY STAGE, I DECIDED TO CONFIRM THAT FREE ENERGY EXISTED, AND SO I BUILT A FLEET CIRCUIT IN AN EVENING. I DECIDED TO USE TWO SMALL 12 - VOLT LEAD - ACID BATTERIES FOR THE TEST AND I CHOSE TO USE FOUR DIODES IN A BRIDGE RATHER THAN JUST A SINGLE DIODE . I CHOSE TO USE TWO BATTERIES AND STAY AWAY FROM ANY FORM OF MAINS INPUT SO THAT IT WOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT NO CONVENTIONAL FO RM OF ADDITIONAL POWER COULD UPSET THE RESULTS.

Tesla 4 - battery system, Bedini 3 - battery system, Ron Cole’s 1 - battery system http://www.vems.hu/freeenergy/pajert62/Tesla_Battery_Switch_2.P GFED.pdf The current flowing through the bulb can be arranged to be a charging current for another battery. It can both light the bulb and charge another battery without needing any extra current: Here, the circuit is powered by battery 1 as before, but this time the current goes on to charge battery 2. Yes, battery 1 gets discharged just as before, but the plus side is that battery 2 is getting charged up all the time. The final step is to swap t he batteries over: And now, the newly charged battery 2 lights the bulb and charges up battery 1 again. Seem impos - sible? Well it isn’t. Nikola Tesla demonstrates this with his “4 - battery switch” system where he chooses to use four identical batteries to implement this circuit: With 12 - volt batteries as shown here, the bulb has the same 12 volts across it as it would have had with the sing le battery shown in the first dia - gram, as batteries 1 and 2 are wired “in series” to give 24 volts, while bat teries 3 and 4 are wired “in paral lel” to give 12 volts. Nikola Tesla arranged his circuit to swap the batteries over with 1 and 2 taking the place of 3 and 4. He chose to do it in a slightly different way a nd he swapped the batteries over hund - reds of times per second."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 The Weird stuff: There is another important factor involved in battery - charging circuits to be used with normal lead - acid batteries and that is the practical detail of the materials involved. The charging process in this switching circuit is carried out by electrons flowi ng down the connecting wire and into the battery. The electrons flowing along the outer surface of the wire, move very rapidly indeed. The main current inside the battery is carried by the charged ions inside the lead plates inside the battery. These ions are hundreds of thousands of times heavier than the electrons . This doesn’t matter at all once the ions get moving, but in the initial split second before the ions get going , the incoming electrons pile up like in a traffic jam tail - back. This pile - up of electrons pushes up the voltage on the terminal of the battery , well above the nominal battery voltage, and so the charging starts off with a high - voltage, high - current pulse into the battery. This is not normally noticed when using a standard mains - powere d battery charger , as switch - on only occurs once during the whole charging process. In the Tesla switch shown here , and in the Bedini circuits shown earlier, this is not the case . The circuit takes advantage of this difference in momentum between the electrons and the lead ions, and uses it repeatedly to great advantage. The technique is to use very short duration pulses all the time. If the pulses are short enough, the voltage and current drive into the receiving battery is far greater than a quick gl ance at the circuit would suggest. This is not magic, just common - sense characteristics of the materials being used in this circuit. A person unfamiliar with these systems, seeing John Bedini’s many advanced circuits for the first time, might get the impr ession that they are just crude, roughly - built circuits. Nothing could be further from the truth. John often uses mechanical switching because it gives very sharp switch - on and switch - off times. John is a complete master of this circuitry and knows exactly what he is doing . The Electrodyne Corporation tested the Tesla 4 - battery circuit over a period of three years. They found that at the end of that period , the batteries did not show any unusual deterioration . The batteries used were ordinary lead acid batteries. The system operated lights, heaters, television sets, small motors and a 30 - horsepower electric motor. If the batteries were run down to a low level and then the circuit switch on with a load, the r echar - ging of the batteries took place in under one minute."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 No heating was experienced during this rapid charging . Heat was only produced during discharge cycles. If left undisturbed, each battery would charge up to nearly 36 volts. Control circuitry was developed to prevent this over - charging . They used mechanical switching and stated that below 100 Hz there was not much advantage with the circuit and above 800 Hz it could be dangerous . They didn’t mention why they consider that higher rates of switchin g could be dangerous. If we consider what exactly is happening, perhaps we can work out why they said that. The charging situation is like this At Time “A” the switch closes, connecting a voltage source (battery, charged capacitor, or whatever) to a lead - acid battery. Electrons start flowing down the outside of the connecting wire. Being very light and having little obstruction, they move very fast indeed (the electrons inside the wire only move a few inches per hour as getting through the wire is difficult). All goes well until Time “B” when the leading electrons reach the lead plates inside the battery . Here, they have a problem, because the current flow through the plates is carried by lead ions. Lead ions are very good at carrying current, but it takes them a split second to get going due to their weight . That split second is critical and it opens the door to free - energy. In that split second, the electrons pile up because they are still arriving down the wire at very high speed. So, at Time “C” they have built up into a large body of electrons. This large body of electrons has the same effect as if there had been a sudden connection to a much higher voltage source capable of supplying a much higher current . This situation only lasts for a very short time , but it has three very important effects ."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 - Firstly, at Time “D”, it drives a much larger current into the battery than could reasonably expected from the origi nal voltage source. - Secondly, this effect alters the Zero - Point Energy field (the space - time conti nuum) in which the circuit is located, causing extra energy to flow into the circuit from the outside environment. This is a bit like sunshine generating cu rrent flow in an electric solar panel, but instead of visible sunshine, the energy flow is not visible to us. - Thirdly, the excess energy flows into the battery, charging it much more than would be expected , and at the same time, some of the excess energy flows into the load, powering it as well. The load could be a lamp, a motor, an inverter, a pump, a drill, or whatever. Conclusion : E xcess energy is collected from the environment and used to both char ge the bat tery and at the same time, perform useful work. The old saying “you can’t have your cake and eat it” just does not hold in this situation as that is exactly what happens. Instead of the battery being run down from powering the load, the load gets powered and the bat - tery gets charged up at the same time. Th is why, with this system, a discharged battery can be used to apparently run a motor. It works because the plates in the discharged battery are made of lead which forms a bottleneck for the electron flow , causing the environ ment to charge the battery and run the load at the same time. That is why you get what looks like the magical effect of a discharged battery appearing to power a load. In passing, the more discharged the battery , the faster it charges as the environment a djusts automatically to the situation and feeds greater power into a flat battery. The environment has unlimited power available for use."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 John Bedini who is expert in this field has had motors running continuously for three or more years with the battery never running down and the motor doing useful work all the time. Great battery? No, - great environment !! For the vital build up of excess electrons to take place, the switch c losure has to be very sudden and very effective. A thyristor or “SCR” is suitable for this as once it is started, it switches on rapidly and fully. Sound good so far? This is only the start. I suggest that the Tesla 4 - battery switch circuit operated in th e 100 Hz to 800 Hz region operates in this way. This situation can be further enhanced by suddenly cutting off the electron flow from the original voltage source while the excess electron pile - up is still in place. This causes a sudden (very brief) further surge in the excess power, building up the voltage and current even further and increasing the battery charging and load powering drive. An even greater effect can be had if the next, short, sharp pulse is applied to the battery/load com - bi nation, just before the effect from the last pulse dies away. I suggest that this is the situation which the Electrodyne Corporation people encountered when the pulse rate went over the 800 Hz rate. I suggest that it is not so much a case that the battery and load could not take the power, but more a case that the components which they were using were not rated high enough to carry that level of power. They do mention that if they went further, that they found that some of their circuit components started failing th rough not having high enough ratings (notice that the output capacitors are rated at 100 volts which is eight times the nominal battery voltage). This was hardly a problem, considering that they had 12 - volt batteries operating happily at 36 - volts if they w anted that. They ended up building circuitry to hold the voltages down to a convenient level. To summarise the situation. The Tesla 4 - battery switch appears to do the impossible through: 1. Catching the current coming out of the load and using it to char ge another battery instead of wasting it. 2. Providing very short, sharp, and rapid switching pulses which exploit the momentum of the lead - ions current flow. 3. Pulling extra energy in from the local environment to both charge the batteries and power the load at the same time This leaves aside t he possibility of two further gains available through very precise timing of the switching pulses (mainly to make the power available more easily and cheaply handled). So, it should be borne in mind that the practical issues involved in getting this circu it operating effectively are primarily about very fast, clean and welltimed switching . Stranded, high - current rated wire will be helpful in getting the draw of excess energy into the circuit. Tesla has used four diodes to simplify the switching and reduce it to two On/Off switches plus two changeover switches. Alternatively, six On/Off switches can be used.

The 1983 date of the Brandt circuit pre - dates John Bedini’s work on this system. Ron's circuits used mechanical (as opposed to solid state) contractors as switches , but apparently worked quite well, as l ong as the contactors lasted. John was the first to adapt this circuit to solid - state switching , using the SG 1524 dual flip - flop functions and bipolar transistors as the switches. John has told me that his \"cigar box\" unit ran a small electric motor for more than 6 months without discharging the batteries AT ALL. He also told me that the original working model was smashed by a \"guest\" in his shop who was infuriated by its operation, while John was out of the room. At this point, he decided not to rebuild it. I know John personally, and have no reason to doubt this report. Obviously, the voltage drops in the transistors and diodes present a CONSTANT loss during operation, not to mention the energy dissi - pated at the load. Therefore, the system defies all standard explanations and energy use equations. The batteries apparently stay charged and run loads simultaneously for a reason that is not conventional. Since Ronald Brandt has run a car on this system, and John Bedini has run small motors on miniaturized version, it seems reasonable to assume it is worthy of more study by experimenters. It is recommended that you read a lengthy report; written by Eike Mueller, dated September 3, 1984 entitled “EXPERIME NTS WITH A KROMREY AND A BRANDT - TESLA CONVERTER BUILT BY JOHN BEDINI (we have known Eike Mueller personally) , see : http://www.tuks.nl/pdf/MUELLER_EXPERIMENTS_KROMRE Y_BRANDT_TESLA_BEDINI.pdf With Comments by Tom Bearden 1984 33 pages.

Therefore the COP was 6 :1 . 1. Ron Brandt/Bedini converter + Electrodyne converter: COP not known but the systems have been in use with loads running continously for days, months and years.

If you consider the losses in the inverter, the charger, the cablings and the batteries you will get an overall efficiency of some 50% or a COP of 0,5 :1. Only if you are using the speci al effect of pulse charging – as explained in sections 1 to 6 and exspecially in the theoreticl paper of Dr. Cyril Smith you can get COP > 1 or CP >> 1."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Already when you can realize a COP of 2 :1 you are 4 times better then in the case of charging with con tinous current. If e.g. weg et 5 kW on the inverter output we feed 2,5 kW back via loader tot he batteries and have 2,5 kW «free» to be used by the load. But when we discuss a COP = 9 :1 as Carlos Ucrós has realized (according to this website) then we can deliver e.g. 4,44 kW to the load, 0,56 kW to the charger which is 1/9 of the of the total 5 kW which the inverter generates (which an efficiency of about 95%). If the inverter consumes 4,8 kW at 12 V, this correponds to a current of 400 A. With a COP = 9 : 1 it can be assumed that the charger produces also 400 A pulses but with a pulse - pause ratio of 1:9 at a frequency of some 900 Hz. This large amount of down - up slopes of the pulses generates a fast elec - tron flow and helps to charge the battery much faster compared with DC - current. The net power needed of the charger on the primary site is 4,8 kW/9 = 0,53 kW. But the actual values may differ because we have also to consider the ohmic losses in different component and the wires. 7. Special considerations by Rick Friedrich to Tesla - Switch - Systems As it is written in https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=q1FyajzU3So Bedini himself has known that some circui t designs which are not recommended and can even ruin the batteries. This is also the case with the traditional Tesla Switch which Bedini has presented at the 1984 Tesla Symposium. According to Rick Friedrich it was Carlo Benitez who has developped 100 yea rs ago the real (working) Tesla Switch. In his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=q1FyajzU3So he emphasized several times that in fact the Bedini Tesla Switc h caused a lot of problems (1:32). Lot of people wasted their time and money (1:42) and ruined their batteries (18:55). The type of Tesla Switch which Beini promoted actually destructed the batteries (2:25) as it did the Watson machine (22:54). The princi pal of t he Tesla Switch (o r Brandt) wi t h two batteries in series and two in parallel war not invented by Bedini but 100 years before by Carlos F. Benitez (5:47). Carlos switched the batteries very slowly (7:53). Also the Bedini Tesla Switch Solar Amplifie r ha d some serious failures (27:19 ). The switching was to fast and stressed the batteries.

Even if such phenomena would have occured it would not be possible or rec ommended that the inventor refers to such effects in his patent description + in the claims. The reason is that there is s till now no accepted theory which could explain how such a breach of energy conservation could occur. But if we consider the different circuits and experiences of trained engineers resp. inventors like Bedini et.al. as documented in this paper it is evident that some additional energy is flowing into some circuits resp. batteries from the environment resp. the qua n tum field or zero poin t field. As explained later it can be assumed that we need some new sophisticated theories for explaining this kind of phenomena.

Example : Ossie Callanan’s Free - Energy System In 2007, Ossie Callanan published a document showing how and why he was getting COP>1 battery charging. Ron Pugh’s system kindly shared in detail above, with careful tuning and running on 24 volt input and 24 volt output operates at COP>10 which is likely to be due to Ron’s skill in building and adjusting, both of which are very good indeed, coupled with the use of many transistors working in parallel and tripled charging diodes to improve their performance ... ... Radiant energy pulses are Back - EMF pulses provi ded that they have very fast rising edges and falling edges and occur at high frequencies. They are not transistor transients or switching transients! A spark - gap produces classical radiant energy pulses. They are chaotic events but they are radiant energy events nevertheless. Switching a coil on very rapidly using a transistor will produce one radiant energy pulse from the coil’s Back - EMF, but one pulse on its own is no good. You need thousands or better still, millions of those pulses for them to be of an y practical use..

Amazingly, unlike the clamping diodes in the SSG, this is not wasteful. This reed switch oscillation actually reduces the input current. Instead of the reed remaining closed for the whole of the pulse duration, it switches on and off and so, less input power is drawn from the driving battery....

But n othing can be concluded here. I am speculating as to what might be happening and without experimental proof, it will remain speculation. The electro - chemical processes in a lead acid battery are so complex that trying to find a defi nitive explanation is extremely difficult. The internal currents of the battery, especially those of the Lead and Hydrogen ions are extremely important , but there is little written about them.

There exists the possi bility of overunity charging of the lead - acid battery by having charging pulses that exhibit a fast rise time and an optimum pulse width. Current flows into the battery during the voltage rise to charge the inter - electrode capacitance, that time being too short for any chemical reactions to take place. That value of stored electronic charge is then converted into chemical energy and the pulse is slowly ter mi na ted during this process. The stored chemical energy appears to be greater than the electrical energy supplied. It is recommended that this possibility be researched. Additional Info rmation s to John Bedini (added on Jan. 15, 2017) In 1985, radio talk show master Bill Jenkins of KABC, a Californian radio station, used his guest speaker seat at a public forum on March 12 at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles to announce a FE device with John Bedini and Steve Werth ...

The then 37 - year - old Bedini told the forum that he would like to make his generator available to people everywhere at a symbolic price instead of selling it to the highest bidder. According to his description, his model worked with high - energy, pulsed, phase - shifted scalar waves to pull the zero - point energy out of the vacuum . The concept is not in the common textbooks on physics, but it is an absolutely natural concept and actually works, he said. A few weeks later Bedini received a visit from two thugs who were definitely opposed to his efforts to disconnect from the existing power structure. They looked like bodybuilders just leaving t he g ym, pushing him against the wal l of his shop, threatening him to understand that they expected him to continue using gas . Bedini laughs briefly as he remembers, but obviously he knew they were serious. Now that he lives in Idaho, he believes that the r eason that \"the\" no longer threaten him is that he only builds his toys in toy size. His model collection demonstrates only one principle - which he believes could supply a whole house with electricity if the models were built in the appropriate size. This principle involves the storage of short energy discharge pulses that arise when performing work with previously stored energy. The sequence is \"do work, unload, do work, unload\", etc. Last year John Bedini passed away, see: http://www.borderlands.de/net_pdf/NET0117S30 - 33.pdf Comparison of fast charging and pulse charging (Dissertation) www.borderlands.de/Links/Batterie - Schnell - und - Pulsladen.pdf Die Schnellladung von Bleibatterien ist vor allem für den Einsatz in Elektrofahrzeugen ein wichtiges Mittel, um di e tägliche Reichweite zu erhöhen. Vor allem bei der Schnellladung tritt die Nebenreaktion der Wasserzersetzung in der Bleibatterie gegenüber der Ladereaktion mehr und mehr in den Vordergrund.. In dieser Arbeit wurde daher daran gearbeitet, durch gezielte B eeinflussung der Reaktionskinetik durch Pulsladeverfahren das Gleichgewicht zwischen Lade - und Gasungsreaktion zur Ladereaktion hin zu verschieben. Über Modellrechnungen wurde gezeigt, daß die Pulsladung dazu ein geeignetes Instrument darstellt... Fast charg ing of lead - acid batteries is an important means of increasing the daily range, especially for use in electric vehicles. Especially in the case of rapid charging, the secondary reaction of the water decomposition in the lead battery is increasingly coming to the fore against the charging reaction. In this work, therefore, the equilibrium between charging and gassing reaction towards the charging reaction was worked out by deliberately influencing the reaction kinetics by pulsed charging move. Model calculat ions have shown that the pulse charge is a suitable instrument for this ...
