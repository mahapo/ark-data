During a survival or emergency situation such as a natural disaster, clean and potablewater is a primary requirement. More often than not, private and public water systemshave pumps that are electricity-powered. However, if the electricity is cut in anemergency situation, there would be no other power source for these types of watersystems. Thus, in a critical situation, one may find a dire need for a source of cleanand potable water. During survival or emergency situations, an individual may find various sources ofwater. However, these water sources may be full of debris, mud, animal matter, rottenplant, and other dirt and bacteria. Thus, water from available sources in emergencysituations could not be drinkable. In this light, an individual would need a quick way toeliminate the dirt and bacteria from the water in order to make it drinkable and usable. One of the safest water sources is a camping water filter, which can be purchasedcommercially. Camp water filters are designed for the purpose of removing manytypes of chemicals and bacteria from water especially for hikers who drink water fromponds and streams that they come across during their hikes. On the other hand, during survival or emergency situations, one may not simply haveaccess to commercial water filters. Fortunately, there are several ways that anindividual may carry out for building homemade or emergency water filtration systemseven when stuck in a disaster or survival situation."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" How to Assess Water Purity In a survival situation, once you are able to find water, the first thing that comes to mindis its pureness. You may be doubtful on whether you can drink or use it. These days, the issue of water purity has become more complicated than it was 20years ago. For instance, in 1993, water from natural resources such as rivers, lakes,and streams are still drinkable even if unfiltered. However, in recent years, the spreadof a non-native cyst or organism known as Giardia has increased the risk of obtainingwater and drinking it straight from these natural sources. Giardia can debilitate a person once it is acquired. It targets the digestive tractprimarily. It has been determined that Giardia spreads through beaver droppingsalthough recent studies claim that other animals can spread this organism as well. In addition, chemical as well as industrial pollutants are more prevalent today than theywere in the past years. In spite of the dangers of these pollutants, they have stillbecome widespread, affecting various bodies of water. Some of the most commonwater pollutants include modern-day pollutants such as heavy metals and chemicals,bacterial agents, and suspended and silt materials. It is important for you to segregate your containers that you use for storing water. Forinstance, you should make use of a different container for impure water from the one inwhich you store purified water. In order to assess the purity of water, you should make sure to follow some generalrules applicable for different situations. Some of the guidelines for assessing waterpurity include the following:\u0000 Always look for clear water\u0000 Avoid discolored water\u0000 Avoid water from swamps and marshes\u0000 Avoid water with algae growth\u0000 Water from the ground such as in springs is purer in general as compared towater running over the ground\u0000 Running water is much better as compared to still water You should also bear in mind that pollutants can be human-made. Regardless if thereis no possibility of human-made or manufactured pollutants in a specific area, humanactivities can also affect water purity. One of the most prominent human activities thataffect water purity is mining. Mining releases various elements that are harmful. These include cyanide, heavy metals, arsenic, and mercury among others. If you are in an area prone to human-made pollutants, the guidelines to follow are asfollows:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\u0000 Do not drink water near mining sites, cities and towns, industries, humanhabitation, and factories\u0000 Do not drink water near roads as engines of automobiles release toxicpollutants that do not go up into the air.\u0000 Do not drink water that has already passed through agricultural areas sincethey may contain pesticides, fertilizers, and other elements. Proper Storage Affects Water PurityIt may seem simple to store water as long as you have a container with a lid or a waterdrum with cover. On the other hand, water storage should be done properly in order tomaintain the purity and quality of water. Different materials of water containers areavailable in the market. However, it is best to know which one is appropriate to use fordifferent water storage purposes.For instance, if you are storing water supplies, the most suitable containers are thosemade of glass, fiberglass, plastic, and enamel-lined metal containers. Experts claimthat the best water containers are those made of durable plastic such as soft drinkbottles and mineral water bottles. It is also best to make use of larger containers orfood-grade plastic buckets. On the other hand, if you purchase plastic containers,make sure that they are solely for food and water use. This is because some plasticcontainers contain chemicals that can affect the purity of water.If you are buying water containers for personal use, it is advisable to purchase one thatis no bigger than 2 gallons. This is because if there is leak in the container, you arelikely to lose more of your water supply as compared to smaller containers. You canalso make use of 2-liter soft drink bottles that are made of plastic.If you have larger supply of water to store, the most preferable size is five- or ten-gallondrums that are intended for food or water usage.In addition, there are different types of water bottles with built-in filtration units. Thesewater bottles are great for situations that only necessitate small quantities of water. These water bottles are mostly used by first-time campers.Prior to filling your container with filtered, purified, or treated water, make sure that youwash it thoroughly along with the lid or cover. You can wash the container with hotwater and detergent. You can also sanitize the container by using a cup of bleach to agallon of water.When choosing water containers, you not only consider the container itself. Youshould also take note of its lid. Make sure the lid does not contain any paper material. However, if the lid has a paper component, you can insert polyester plastic orpolyethylene.To ensure the purity of water, make sure you do not store it in empty milk cartons orjuice jugs. This is because the milk containers leave milk proteins that result to growthof bacteria. In addition, you should take note if the container is designed for food andwater storage. Otherwise, do not use it. Finally, make sure that you do not store water in a container that held poisonous ortoxic substances. This is because even tiny amounts of these substances could"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"remain in the pores of the container.Learning about Water Contaminants Water is often the most immediate necessity in a disaster or emergency situation. Conversely, an individual may survive without water for three days depending onhis/her activity level. However, if an individual stays in a situation without properhydration and lack of food, there could be a slim chance of survival. Depending on the area, finding potable and usable water can be a critical problem. Anindividual should not simply wait to become thirsty prior to looking for water. During adisaster or emergency situation, one should quickly find ways to look for drinkablewater unless he/she is willing to drink from contaminated sources. In addition, drinkingwater from contaminated sources could worsen an emergency situation by furtherdehydration and getting sick. There are various types of contaminants that can affect the quality of water. It wouldbe advantageous for most people to know the type of contaminants that may bepresent in water especially during a disaster or an emergency situation. Some of thesecontaminants and their sizes in microns include: Giardia lamblia  8-12 micronsBacteria  0.2-4 micronsCryptosporidium parvum 4-6 micronsViruses  0.004-0.1 microns During a disaster or an emergency, an individual may find a solid container, which cancarry water. These include water bottle, plastic or metal pot, canteen, or milk jug. Onthe other hand, there are other alternatives that can be used including a plastic sheet,which is folded similar to a condom and has no lubricant or spermicide. Water Filtration and Purification Methods for Different Situations \u0000 Filtering by Using Commercially Available Water Filters – There are manygood and efficient water filters available in the market today that can eliminatevarious types of bacteria and pathogens from water including giardia. Commercially-bought water filters are perfect to use for normal situations ratherthan in non-primitive survival circumstances. However, commercial water filtrationand purification systems are usually expensive although they can to their jobefficiently. \u0000 Filtering During Survival Situations – During a survival situation, you can usethree ways to make water drinkable. 4. Building a Water Filter – If the situation is primitive, you can make use of abirch bark, shaping it like a cone for your water filter. You need to fill the cone with"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"layers of charcoal, sand, grasses, and/or other suitable materials. Sand andgrasses can help in trapping small particles in contaminated or soiled water. Charcoal can help in eliminating chemical impurities although it still could notremove bacteria based on several tests and studies. You need to pass the waterthrough the cone at least three times based on the make and size of the filter. Ingeneral, if the filter is big, more layers should fill it. As in a typical cone, the birchbark should have a small hole in its bottom. It needs to be tied with a vine oranything that would prevent it from scattering the contents inside. It is best toplace an appropriate number of stones in the bottom of the cone to hold thematerials inside. Once you put water through the filter, you need to have anothercontainer, which you will use to collect the filtered water. 5. Using the Earth for Water Filtration – The very concept of this is the waterwell, which people have been using even years ago to obtain water. Wells areusually 4 to 4 feet above a source of water such as a river or lake. A hole is dugup to be filled with water from the natural source. Although most water fromnatural sources is believed to be pure, there is no way to tell for sure. 6. Distilling by Using a Solar Still – One of the best methods to filter water isbuilding a solar still. All you need is sunshine and suitable materials. The impurewater is poured into the solar still, which looks like a pit. The water is allowed toevaporate through the sun’s help. It is advisable to use any absorbent material tosaturate the impure water. This material will be placed in the solar still while thewater evaporates. Water is then collected from the underside of the still cover andwould drip to a collecting container. \u0000 Boiling – This is the safest and most common method of purifying water frommicrobes and bacteria. On the other hand, it has not yet been determined as tohow long it needs to take to eliminate harmful microbes when boiling water. Conversely, studies claim that water should be boiled at least 5 minutes althoughjust to be sure, the ideal length of time is 20 minutes.When boiling water, you need a source of heat and a fire-proof container. Water ispoured into the container prior to placing the container on the fire. In othercircumstances, you can also make use of rock-boiling wherein stones are placedin fire. You need to wait for the stones to heat up. Remove the stones from thefire and place them in the container filled with water. Since the stones are still hot,they would transfer heat to the water. You need to make use of as many stones orrocks as possible and keep adding them to the water container. This way, thewater would boil and stays heated until you reach the required time of 5 to 20minutes. Basics of Water Filtration and Purification Process A. Filtration Filtration is a process that can make water more attractive to drink even after a properpurification process. It is a fact that most people could not drink water with dirt, leaves,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"and algae among others; thus, filtration is very much recommended. The simplest form of filtration is using a cloth in which water can run through. The clothshould have a very tight weave in order to filter finer particles. On the other hand, if acloth with a tighter weave is unavailable, any cloth will do as long as it is folded inmultiple layers to help filter smaller particles. B. PurificationIn a survival situation, it can be more helpful if people have knowledge in simple waterpurification techniques such as boiling and chemical treatment. Boiling Boiling is considered as the simplest technique when it comes to eliminatingviruses and bacteria from water. It is said that boiling can destroy organisms inwater by pushing it to a heat range of 212 °F or 100 °C. This heat range caneliminate most types of organisms apart from bacteria. In a survival situation in which an individual can obtain fire and has a watercontainer, he/she can fill the container that can be placed over the fire. Once thecontainer is already on fire, bring the water to a boil and afterwards, allow it tocool. Boiling can eliminate almost all types of harmful bacteria present in waterbecause most bacteria cannot survive in hot temperatures. In addition, boiling isbetter than any other method of purification since no chemicals are added to thewater. On the other hand, an individual should have a source of heat that canproduce fire so that the water can be brought to a boiling point. Chemical Treatment Some of the most common chemicals used for treating water include iodine,sodium chlorite/chlorine dioxide, potassium permanganate, and chlor-floc. However, water chemical treatment may not eliminate some parasites due toseveral factors such as expiration date of the chemicals and the temperature andclarity of water. \u0000 Iodine crystals - When treating water with iodine crystals, bacteria can beeliminated through affecting the ion balance in the bacteria’s cell and replacing theelements that the bacteria use for survival with iodide ions. On the other hand,iodine can be harmful and poisonous to people especially young children as wellas pregnant women. Thus, there should only be a certain amount when purifyingwater with iodine. Most health experts would suggest avoiding the use of iodinefor water purification for longer time periods. During a survival situation, one may fill a container with water. Shake the containerand let it stand for an hour to allow the iodine be saturated in the water. Add theindicated amount of capfuls of iodine to the container and shake it to achieveappropriate mixture. Leave the container for 20 to 30 minutes. Finally, the wateris already drinkable."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" The advantage of using iodine crystals is that it can treat 10,000 gallons of water. However, it cannot be used for extended periods. \u0000 Sodium Chlorite/Chlorine Dioxide – These tablets make use of chlorination topurify water. Sodium chlorite produces chlorine dioxide that enables it to treatwater. More often than not, chlorination is a technique used to disinfect water inmunicipalities across the globe. This is because chlorine is able to destroy the cellwalls of bacteria or viruses; thus, eliminating the organism. The possibility ofcausing damage to one’s health is low when drinking chlorinated water. Anindividual’s digestive system can neutralize chlorine quickly, making it safe for thegastrointestinal tract to stand chlorine concentrations. It is advisable to add a sodium chlorite/chlorine dioxide tablet to a quart of a watercontainer, leaving the mixture for at least 4 hours. It may help to shake thecontainer to help dissolve the tablet quickly as well as improve the distribution ofthe chemicals in the water. One may find the mixture with slight chlorine or bleach taste. The advantage ofusing these tablets is the simplicity of the process. An individual would only haveto add them and wait for the specific time when it can already be drinkable. However, the disadvantage is waiting for more than a couple hours before themixture can finally be used. \u0000 Potassium Permanganate – This chemical can be purchased commerciallyoften in hardware stores. It is being sold as a softener for water and is available inpowder and pill forms. There are various uses of this chemical compound. Apartfrom being able to purify water, it can also be a component for fire-starting. In order to treat a quart of water, one can use 3 to 4 crystals, which is equivalent to1 gram per liter. Types of Homemade or Survival Water Filtration Systems 1. Micro-filters Micro-filters make use of a ceramic filter to remove any form of contaminant fromwater. Pathogens are removed effectively by letting the water pass through themicroporous membrane with pores that are smaller than common contaminants. 2. Transpiration Bags One of the most common kinds of transpiration bag is the vegetation bag, which isused to collect water. As plants take in carbon dioxide, converting it to organiccompounds through sunlight, water and carbon dioxide result as its by-product. Thus,when water evaporates from plants, transpiration occurs."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Plants absorb water through their roots and nutrients and minerals are provided for theentire plant. Both water and oxygen are released during this process. Simply said,transpiration involves the process wherein water from the ground is distributed in otherparts of the plant to provide nutrients. Water and oxygen are also released to theatmosphere during this process. In a disaster or an emergency situation, the vaporreleased to the atmosphere can be used to collect water. Some of the advantages of using transpiration bags include:\u0000 Water from plants is a clean and pure source of water\u0000 Minimal effort is required; thus, less energy is spent\u0000 Bags are able to collect water even when an individual has other things to do When stuck in a survival situation, an individual can place transpiration bags, say,along a tree line. Even in just a few minutes, one may already see the condensation inthe bag. When water condenses, it can already drip to the lowest area of the bag. After a few hours under the sun, the bag would have already collected a fair amount ofwater at the bottom of the bag. It would only take minimal energy to gather water fromthe bag. An individual may also collect dew and rain water using transpiration bags. Bagsunder direct sunlight can collect more water as compared to bags that are hanged orlined in a shaded area. On the other hand, when using transpiration bags, anindividual should make sure that the plant used is not poisonous or toxic. 3. Solar Still In a survival situation, it can be very difficult to procure potable or usable water. Inaddition, it can be tough for someone to survive without proper nutrition and hydrationunder taxing circumstances. Various activities in different temperatures can alsolessen one’s chances of survival. In waterless situations, the human body can onlytake a few days to survive without water. Dehydration may already show symptomsafter 3 to 4 days. Cramps, fatigue, and headache are its most common symptoms. Furthermore, when these symptoms arise, it would be all the more difficult for anindividual to find potable or usable water. During a survival situation in coastal or desert regions, the solar still is one of the mostcommon methods used to procure water. A solar still or distiller is used as equipmentfor liquids purification. To produce vapor, an individual should have a source of heat. The vapor condenses and turns into liquid again as it cools. A survivalist may be ableto use this process in order to eliminate contaminants from water. Similarly, thisprocess can also be used during a survival situation specifically in desert or coastalregions. Countries that have rare or no readily available potable water usually make use of solarstills. These stills are available in different types. In survival situations, the pit solarstill is often used. Solar stills may also come in cone-shaped or box types. Regardlessof the shapes and ways of obtaining liquid, the different types of solar stills make use ofa single principle. For instance, a survivalist can make use of a clear plastic sheet to"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"create a solar pit. The radiation from the sun is used to distill water. It is important totake note that the soil also contains a specific moisture level. Vegetation can help inincreasing the output of water from the pit. In the desert, a cactus may be used bycrushing and adding it to the still’s bottom. Water from a contaminated source of watercan also be poured into the still. The shape of the pit solar still can be square-shaped or V-shaped. For instance, asmall bowl can be placed at the middle of a box-shaped pit solar still covering the pitwith the clear plastic sheet. Sand can be used in order to anchor the plastic sheet. Asmall rock or stone can be placed in the center of the bowl. As water evaporates andcondenses, water will eventually drip from the plastic sheet and into a water container. In order to increase the amount of water that would evaporate an individual may addany fluid that is clean or unclean and vegetation. To draw out water from the solar still,surgical tubing can be used even without removing the plastic sheet. 4. Charcoal Filters It is believed that charcoal contains elemental carbon, which is found in its graphitecomposition. Long ago, people have already used carbon to purify water. In fact,charcoal has been used as far back as ancient times specifically in India and Egypt. Carbon in its graphite form has shown has shown a high surface area per volume. This is to say that one gram of activated carbon can have a surface area of just a littlesmaller than a 5000-meter football field. A gram of industrially produce carbon equalsa surface area of 400 to 1,500 meters. Carbon filters are usually used in large scale water treatment facilities in variousmunicipalities. Even commercially-bought water treatment systems used in homesmake use of carbon filters usually to improve taste and color. Carbon filters are deemed efficient in eliminating mercury, chlorine, iodine, and otherinorganic compounds. Carbon filters can also remove other organic contaminantsincluding volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) andformaldehyde (HCOH). On the other hand, activated carbon could not blend well withcertain chemicals such as alcohols, ammonia, glycols, metals, strong bases and acids,and inorganic substances like lead, arsenic, fluoride, sodium, iron, and nitrates. Thus,carbon would only blend with non-polar materials. In addition, polar materials wouldstill remain in water even if carbon is employed. Many types of pesticides areconsidered non-polar and organic. As such, they are likely absorbed on the carbonsurface. Based on the EPA National Drinking Water Standards, water contaminants that arelikely reduced to standards that are acceptable through activated carbon includechromium, mercury, organic arsenic, inorganic mercury, endrin, methoxychlor,benzene, lindane, 1.1-dichloroethylene, 1.2-dichloroethane, 1.1.1-trichloroethane, 2.4-D, 2.4.5-TP, toxaphene, p-dichlorobenzene, and trihalomethanes. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Building Homemade or Survival Water Filtration Systems Homemade Charcoal Water Filters When creating a simple charcoal water filtration system, the materials to be usedinclude:\u0000 A large container\u0000 Lots of charcoal\u0000 Little gravel\u0000 Sand\u0000 A piece of tubing\u0000 Hammer or anything similar to it\u0000 Sharp, metal object like barbeque skewer or screwdriver\u0000 A piece of string long enough to circle the container\u0000 A piece of absorbent fabric (optional) Given that you are in a survival or emergency situation, it may be difficult to securethese materials. Thus, prior to discussing the steps for creating a simple charcoal filter,several alternatives and ways to secure the materials needed can be used. For instance, the container can be anything, which is able to hold water and has notbeen filled up with poisonous or toxic chemicals. The container may be a barrel, 2-literbottle with cut-off top, plastic storage tub, or a 5-gallon bucket among others. More often than not, sand can be found near a body of water. You may also findsandbags used to control flood waters. In a survival situation, you may find sand fromplayground sandboxes in the event that the situation is in a city or non-coastal areas. You can make use of a small PVC pipe for the tubing. If a garden hose is available,you may cut off a small part of it. If these two options are not possible, you can take apiece from a side of large plastic bottle and form into a tube or pipe. For the charcoal, you can burn hardwood until it produces coals. Once there are coals,bury the fire with dry soil in order to cool. Dig out the homemade charcoal, which willappear as a crumbly stuff from the dry earth. If charcoal briquettes are available, theyshould be broken up prior to using them for a water filter. The fabric can be an old bed sheet or t-shirt. To build the homemade charcoal filters, follow these steps: 1. Create a hole in one side of your container by using the hammer and sharpmetal object. The hole should only less than half an inch from the bottom of thecontainer. If your container is made of plastic, you can try melting a hole throughheating the metal object. Push it into the container while it is hot to make thehole. For plastic containers, it is advisable to heat the metal object for making thehole since plastic is brittle and might split if hammer is used upon it."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2. Insert your tubing material making sure that it fits in the hole as tightly aspossible. Push the tubing until it reaches the inside of your container.3. You can now put gravel into your container. The amount of gravel you put inthe container should be able to reach the area just above the tube. A thick layer oftightly packed charcoal should be placed into the container. This would fill about½ to 2/3 of the container way up. Then, add a layer of sand into the container,reaching an inch of the top of the container.4. The piece of fabric is placed loosely over the filter’s top. The edges of thefabric should be draped down the sides of the container. The string is used to tiearound the container and over the fabric. It is important not to tie the fabric tootightly so it would sag slightly.5. You can now use your homemade charcoal filter by simply pouring waterslowly over the fabric’s surface. The water would drip into the layer of the filterwhere there is sand. The amount of water to make the filter saturated depends onthe size of your container. Once your filter is full, you can now see clean waterdripping slowly out of the tube, which is found at the bottom of the filter. If the situation permits, water from this charcoal filter is recommended for boiling toeliminate any persistent bacteria or viruses given that the charcoal, sand, and gravelwould not remove all pathogens. On the other hand, if you have used contaminatedwater, you would still feel that you have accomplished procuring clean water as soonas it drips from an improvised water filter system. Meanwhile, if you need to make use of your homemade charcoal water filter, makesure to change the sand and charcoal regularly. Preferably, these materials should bechanged once a week. Survival Charcoal Bucket Filter The materials and tools used for creating a charcoal bucket filter include the following:1. Commercial activated carbon, filter carbon2. ½-inch ball valve3. 6 to 10 pieces 1/2-inch inner-diameter rubber washers4. 2 pieces 5-gallon plastic bucket with lid5. 3 to 4 feet Teflon tape6. 2 pieces 1/2 –inch PVC elbow fitting, threaded and slip7. 2 pieces ½ inch female threaded PVC insert connector8. 1 piece ½ inch male threaded PVC insert connector9. ½ inch PVC end-cap slip10. 2 pieces ½ inch PVC bushing, threaded11. 6 pieces ½ inch inner-diameter vinyl/Tygon tubing12. ½ inch PVC adapter; male, threaded; female, slip13. 1 gallon 15-pound pea gravel14. 2 gallons 30-pound sand15. 1 gallon 15-pound coarse gravel16. ½ inch PVC drainpipe, 9 inches long17. Nickel"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18. 15 by 15 inch window screen19. Drill (sheet metal drill bit, spade drill bit)20. Box cutter, pocket knife, pliers, scissors21. Measuring cup 1 liter or larger22. Sandpaper (medium to coarse) A charcoal bucket filter can be used in a household of no more than 5 people who wantto procure potable water from rainwater but are hesitant to do so due to possiblecontamination from various factors. Although it may be quite doubtful to generate water from a slow sand filter in a shortspan of time, fine sand can serve as an efficient filter through blocking microorganismsthat could not fit pore spaces between grains of sand. The design for this charcoalbucket filter is not comparable to full-scale sand filter designs but it is likewise efficientin water filtration. As part of the specifications of this charcoal bucket filter, it would make use of a multi-layered design in the form of charcoal, which is positioned between two layers of graveland fine sand. Unlike homemade charcoal water filters, the charcoal used in thisdesign is purchased commercially as filter carbon or activated charcoal. Filter carbonis available in a aquarium supplies shops. In this design, the quantity of filter carbon to be used is measured in estimates. Thedesign would make use of 1 gram of activated charcoal, which is essential in purifying1 liter of rainwater. A gram of activated charcoal is enough to purify 10 liters ofrainwater. However, the design specifications would make use of a 1 gram to 1 literratio since the water will be used for drinking. The charcoal’s density is about 500grams per liter. This design for a charcoal bucket filter also makes use of a single valve that is installedbetween the rainwater bucket and the filter bucket. This valve will be the responsiblefor controlling the flow of water in the system. For this charcoal bucket filter, drilling 1 to 3 holes in a disk-shaped object such as anickel is necessary to create a flow restrictor. The disk-shaped objects should fitexactly into the 1-inch ball valve housing. To support the layers of filtration as well as to keep sand from flowing up into the pipe,rock and pea gravel are used. The sequence of the filtration media should be in thefollowing manner: Coarse gravel → pea gravel → sand → charcoal → sand → pea gravel → coarsegravel The layers of sand or gravel should be 2 to 3 inches deep each. In addition, thefiltration media should be able to fill up the entire bucket. The sand to be used shouldbe fine-grained. More so, the sand should be washed thoroughly. For instance, if playsand is to be used, it should be pre-washed although it may still need additional"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"washing in order to eliminate silt. Apart from the sand, the charcoal, coarse gravel,and pea gravel should also be washed prior to using them in the filter. To wash the charcoal, you can make use of a piece of window screen which is 3ft by3ft in size in order to wash 1 gallon of charcoal at a time. The bundle of charcoalshould be tied with twine. Dunk the bundle several times in clean water. Once thewater blackens, discard it and dunk the bundle in clean water again until most of thefine particles are eliminated. For the filter pipe assembly, you would have to drill several holes into a 9-inch longsection of PVC pipe. The filter pipe aids in dispersing the water flow into the bucket. Italso helps in even distribution of the materials in the filter media. Holes are also drilled near the bucket’s bas and the lid of the filter bucket. Plumbingjoints are used for the holes, using rubber washers that prevent leaks and provide atight fit in the holes. PVC connections are all taped with Teflon, which provides good sealing as well asprevents leaks. On the other hand, PVC slip fittings can be made hand-tight to avoidthe need for PVC glue. In order to fabricate a rainwater input bucket, cut an 8 inch circle from the bucket lid. Then secure a 15 by 15 inch of window screen on the bucket’s mouth using the lid’srim. This assembly eliminates debris in the rainwater source and prevents clogging inthe water filter system. It is important that the lid of the filter bucket fits exactly in order to prevent leaks whenthe filtration process begins. In the even that leak is not prevented, Teflon tape can besecured in the gap to seal the rim of the bucket’s mouth. However, if the leak persists,soft silicon sealants can be used to seal the lid to the bucket’s rim. Simple Water Filtration and Purification System A pure water source is a primary concern most especially in an emergency or survivalsituation. Although you can collect rainwater using a clean container, you may not besure if there are no contaminants that come from roofing. Any other way of procuringwater from natural sources is recommended to be purified through purification tablets,boiling, or iodine. On the other hand, you can make a simple water filtration andpurification system through the following steps: \u0000 Using a piece of cloth and cord, you can start creating your container for thesystem. You can use a forearm of your old shirt or the bottom of a pant leg thatyou no longer use. Any cloth can be used just as long as it is open-ended. Youcan also peel a piece of bark from a tree, shaping it into a cone to hold the filter’scontents. Vines can be used to secure the piece of bark together.\u0000 In order to allow you to place contents on the filter, tie the bottom of thecontainer as tightly as possible. Make sure that water can seep through the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"bottom down to the collection container.\u0000 A looped cord is tied to the container’s top. Hang the container to a tree limbat around chest height.\u0000 Place a layer of stones or small rocks in the container’s bottom in order tohold the rest of the contents.\u0000 Layers of sand, charcoal, and grass alternating each other should be put intothe container. At least two layers of each material should be put into thecontainer. You may have to leave sufficient space at the top of the container for acertain amount of water.\u0000 You are now ready to pour water into the top of the water filtration system. The water, regardless if it is stagnant, muddy water or rainwater should begin topass through the filter slowly once you pour it into the system. It should be able todrip from the bottom of the filter into the collection container. You might need to dothis several times and finishing the process may likewise take a few hours to filterand purify water. \u0000 Once you have secured your desired amount of water in your collectioncontainer, boil it over fire to eliminate any persistent parasites or pathogens. Simple Sand Water Filter It is important to know how to create your own water filter especially if you are in asurvival or emergency situation. There are various ways to make water filtrationsystems. One of the most common ways to create water filtration systems is usingsand. In fact, the nature’s way to purify is sand. As such, it is preferable to know howto create a simple sand water filter. The steps are as follows: 1. You would need a container. It is best to make use of a large container suchas an empty can or plastic bucket. Once you have secured a container, punch atleast 5 holes it its bottom. If you are making use of a plastic bucket or bottle, cutthe end of the bottle evenly. On the other hand, if you cannot find a container, youmay make use of any material that you find that is similar to a container.2. You should make sure that the sand is sealed or stopped from getting out ofyour container. Some of the best filter materials that you can place at thecontainer’s bottom include a grass mesh, cotton material, or pebbles.3. After putting sand at the bottom of the container, you should now add a layerof gravel. Gravel is used to make the filter material stronger as well as prevent thesand from mixing into the water.4. To top the container, add another layer of sand.5. Pour the water you have collected from rainwater or roofs into the filter. Youshould have another container for water collection. The water that would come outof the filter should be clear. If you still see that the water is cloudy, you may haveto go through the filtration process again.6. After you have collected water from your simple sand water filter, you are nowready to purify it even more by boiling it over heat.7. If you choose to improve your water filter, you can add a charcoal layerbetween the layers of sand and gravel. You can obtain charcoal from your fire bycrushing it into fine gravel-sized particles."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Improvised Charcoal Filter In a survival situation, water is inevitably an important necessity. During this type ofsituation, it is safe to assume that any water coming from the ground is not safe todrink. As such, you need to filter and purify it prior to using or drinking the water. Thebest way to ensure that all pathogens are eliminates is to boil the water. On the other hand, you can also make use of an improvised charcoal filter to removeparticles such as sediments and other harmful contaminants to ensure drinking cleanwater as well as improve its taste. Charcoal has been used in most household and incountry water filters. To create an improvised charcoal filter, you need to secure a 2-liter plastic bottlealthough a sheet of tree bark can also be used. You can also make use of a clay potthat has a hole in the bottom. Other survivalists have come up with variousalternatives such as a glass bottle with removed bottom and a length of cane orbamboo. Steps for Improvised Charcoal Filter:1. Acquire charcoal which has already cooled completely. You can obtaincharcoal from a camp fire and come up with a coal bed. You need to cover coalbed with ash or dirt and leave it for at least 2 days. Once you uncover thecharcoal, make sure to let it cool completely prior to removing it from the coal bed. Crush the charcoal in small parts preferably the size of aquarium gravel. 2. Secure a container with open ends. It is advisable to look for a container thatis tall rather than wide. 3. Fill the opening of the container that has a smaller size with a piece of fabric. If both the openings are of the same size, just choose between them. Filling thesmaller opening of the container can prevent the charcoal from coming out of thecontainer or running through the water.4. Make sure that you pack the crushed charcoal tightly into the container. Youshould be able to make a fine matrix so that the water can drip very slowly,blocking sediments or other contaminants. Once you see that the water runsthrough the container instead of dripping, you need to pack the charcoal tighter. Inaddition, you also have to fill your container with crushed charcoal halfway.5. Put the filter on top of another container used for collecting water from theimprovised filter. If you are in a survival situation, it is most likely a pot or anythingthat can catch water. Once this is done, you are now ready to filter the untreatedwater either from rainfall or other available sources.6. Slowly pout the water into the improvised filter. Be careful not to make thesand unstable. Fill the remainder of your container with water allow it to saturateslowly. The water should drip and not run through the bottom of the filter.7. When all the poured water has dripped through the filter, you may pour it backas many times as necessary to make the water clear. 8. If you have already achieved your desired clarity of water, you can start boilingit to ensure it is free of bacteria or any viruses. As mentioned earlier, boiling is the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"safest way to eliminate pathogens. 9. For improving the taste of the water, you can add a small piece of charcoalwhile boiling the water. Solar Still Pit The materials include a container, knife or any sharp-edged object, tree bark, cordage(vine), small stones, grass, sand, and charcoal. The steps in building a solar still pitare quite simple: 1. Use the knife or sharp-edged object to cut the tree bark horizontally. The barkshould be at least 14 inches. Below the first cut, make another horizontal cut thatmatches the start and end points. Cut vertical marks in order to connect thehorizontal marks. The bark should come up in one piece. 2. Roll the bark inward similarly if you are trying to roll up a newspaper. Thebottom of the bark should be rolled tightly. Leave an opening as small as a penny. You should now form a cone-shaped tree bark.3. Tie the cone using the vine to hold it together.4. Add several stones in the cone’s bottom to hold the filter materials.5. Fill the cone with layers of grass, sand, and charcoal alternating each other.6. Pour water into the top part of the cone. Let the water drip to the bottom ofthe cone.7. Collect water from the filter using another container. Repeat until desiredclarity is obtained. Chemicals that are Safe to Use for Water Filtration and Purification In normal circumstances, water filtration is usually done by using high-quality waterfilters. Hand-pump filters are often used in homes. These commercially-manufacturedfilters are efficient in separating clear, clean water from its source water, which may betainted with microorganisms. On the other hand, these filters cannot eliminate toxic-dissolved substances or chemicals. As such, you need to take note of the source fromwhich you acquire water. The advantages of high-quality water filters include portability, easy to operate, andlong-lasting. However, if you do not have enough strength, these filters may be slowand difficult to operate. In addition, they are quite expensive; thus, you would need alarger amount of initial investment as compared to building homemade filters. Although you can build your own water filtration system, most campers and trekkerscarry with them portable water filters, which are available in most camping shops. Theprice of portable water filters ranges from $35 to $250. There are also cheaper modelsof portable water filters but they are slower to operate and heavier in weight. When used alone, commercially-manufactured filters are efficient in removing almostall particulates except some types of viruses. However, to obtain best results, it is"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"advisable to pre-purify the source water before using it with the filter. Combiningmechanical and chemical filtering often results in water that is free from sediment andbiological contaminants. For instance, iodine crystal solution or saturated iodine isefficient in eliminating microbes apart from being more potent as compared to chlorine. Saturated iodine is stable, inexpensive, and portable. However, it should not beconsumed by people with thyroid problems, pregnant women, or anyone for over 14days. The safest chemicals that can be used to filter and purify water include the following: 1. Polar Pure – This chemical is made of crystals that are bottled permanently. Prior to using it, Polar Pure should first be dissolved in water partially. This is doneby filling the bottle with clear water, which is not necessarily pure. Shake the bottleand leave for an hour. Although the crystals would not dissolve completely, therewill be enough iodine in the solution. Since Polar Pure can be bought in a bottle,you should not drink straight from the bottle. Polar Pure is an additive to purifywater and not water itself. You can use it by pouring the source water into a container and adding the solutionas indicated in its bottle. You should take note that iodine is dependent ontemperature. A thermometer on the bottle’s side indicates the capfuls of solutionrequired to a quart of water. If the source water is cloudy, it is best to double thedosage. After covering your container, shake well and wait for at least 20minutes. You may not like the taste and odor of the iodine; however, you can mixthe resulting water with your preferred powdered drinks once purification has beencompleted. 2. Iodine Tincture – This is the liquid, which is normally available and sold inpharmacies. Iodine tincture is placed in small opaque or brown bottles and usedfor treating cuts or bruises. According to experts, iodine tincture can be anefficient killer of microorganisms although some health advisers strongly oppose toits use. This is because it contains isopropyl alcohol. On the other hand, whenusing iodine tincture, make sure it is the product intended for purifying water andnot for some other purposes. 3. Household Clorox Bleach – In general, bleach is a very efficient disinfectant,which is most likely available in your home. Apart from being inexpensive, withjust a gallon, it can treat 4,000 gallons of water. It is safe to drink as long as it isconsumed in small quantities. Bleach can degrade to salt over time. However, itsstrength also weakens over time; as such, it should be replaced for no longer than6 months. When using bleach for water filtration and purification, choose theproduct that is unscented and having no additives. The chlorine bleach shouldonly have sodium hypochlorite in its solution, which is no more than 6%. Thus,make sure you check the label first. You can add bleach to the clear source waterdepending on your desired quantity of resulting water. For a quart of water, add 2drops; for a gallon of water, add 8 drops; and for 5 gallons of water, add ateaspoon. For cloudy source water, double the dosage. You may notice a slightodor of the bleach. You can mask the taste and odor by mixing the resulting waterwith powdered drinks.4. Germicidal Tablets – Also known as hyperiodide tablets, they are available inmany wilderness supply shops or camping stores. It is an inexpensive alternative"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"to high-priced water purifying tablets. Germicidal tablets are usually available in50-table bottles that are able to treat 25 quarts of source water. Some productscome with iodine taste neutralizer. Two tablets are added into a quart of sourcewater. Once you have shaken your container, wait for 30 minutes. If it comes withneutralizing tablets, add 2 tablets to a quart of water after it has been purified. Shake well and wait for 3 minutes prior to drinking it. It is still has odor and tasteof iodine, you can mix it with powdered drinks. 5. Non-scented Chlorine Bleach – This type of bleach can make water potableby adding 16 drops or 1/8 teaspoon to a gallon of water. Shake well and leave forabout 30 minutes. If the water has slight chlorine smell, it means the water canalready be used. If a faint smell of chlorine is not obvious, then you have to repeatthe entire process. On the other hand, if the water is cloudy or excessively cold,you should double the dosage. Once you open the bottle of bleach, its full potencywill only last up to six months. Although bleach is inexpensive, it has a limitedshelf life; thus, its potency degrades.You also have an option to make your own bleach mixture. You can make use ofcalcium hypochlorite, which is also commonly known as pool shock. According tothe Environmental Protection Agency, you can make bleach mixture by adding ordissolving one teaspoon of calcium hypochlorite for every two gallons of water. Inother amounts, you can add 7 grams of high-test granular calcium hypochlorite to7.5 liters of water. The mixture will result to a stock chlorine solution,approximately 500 milligrams per liter. This is because the calcium hypochloritecontains chlorine that is equal to 70% of its own weight. In order to disinfect water,you can add the solution in the ratio 1 is to 100 (chlorine to water). Approximately,this is equivalent to adding 16 ounces of chlorine to every 12.5 gallons of water. To eliminate chlorine odor, you may pour the disinfected water back and forth fromone container to another. 6. Water Purification Tablets – There is a wide range of water purification tabletsavailable in almost all camping stores and wilderness supply shops. Althoughthese tablets are capable of purifying water, you can only purify small amounts at atime. If you choose it as your only purification method, it may take a few tabletsand more than two days to have enough supply of water. Tips on Knowing if Water is Drinkable and Usable There are several ways to know if the water you are about to drink is potable andusable. First, you need to know your water. This means that you need to test thesource water prior to determining what types of microorganisms, microbes, orcontaminants it contains. This way, you would know what type of filter is best to use forthe water. Second, master the art of boiling. It has been said time and again that boiling is thesafest and most efficient way to treat water. In fact, even the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency attests to this. You simply need a kettle or pot in which you canbring the water to a boil. Once the kettle heats up, you would notice bubbles andsteam coming out of the vessel. Let it stand for a minute. Also, you need to considerthat some of the water will evaporate and would lessen your supply if it boils for long"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"periods. Let the water cool to your preferred temperature. You may notice that boiledwater tastes better if it is re-oxygenated. This is done by pouring the water back andforth between 2 uncontaminated containers. You can also treat water with bleach toeliminate persistent bacteria or critters. There are unscented varieties of bleach thatcontains 6% sodium hypochlorite. Purchase only small bottles of bleach since once abottle is opened, its potency decreases. More often than not, the potency of bleach isonly up to six months. You may treat water with bleach by adding 16 drops to 1 gallonof water. Stir and leave for 30 minutes. It is advisable to use ceramic filters becausethey are said to provide protection from bacteria. In addition, ceramic filters do notrequire too much energy. In fact, it only makes use of gravity. As water is poured inthe top of a ceramic filter, the bacteria can no longer go back to the top. Distilling water can also get rid of microorganisms, which may still survive even afterboiling, bleaching, or employing other filtration and purification methods. Distillingwater can eliminate salts, metals, and other pollutants that can be harmful to one’shealth. In general, the process also involves boiling the water to remove anything thatis left behind. Once boiling is done, the vapor is collected and the water is allowed tocondense back into liquid water. You can also build your own distilling system. Thismay be done by suspending a cup, attaching it to a large lid from a pot. Put the layerof water in the pot’s bottom and boil for about 20 minutes. Once the pot cools down,the water which drips to the cup has already been purified. If you do not have a heatsource, you can also purchase an ultraviolet light for use in your home or when you areout in the wilderness. An ultraviolet purifying unit is available in most camping stores. It is basically a bottle that has a small light source, which is inserted into the water. The radiation eliminates most microbes from the water in just 30 to 80 seconds. Although ultraviolet purifying units cannot eliminate impurities like metals, dirt, orchemicals, you can combine this method with another one to obtain clean water."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ConclusionWater is considered as the most important substance ever existed given that all plants,animals, and human beings need it in order to survive. Apart from drinking it as part ofthe body’s sustenance, water is used for other purposes such as washing our bodies,cooking, washing clothes, keeping houses and communities clean, recreation such asswimming pools, and keeping plants and animals alive. Water is very important for thegrowth of farm stock and crops as well. In addition, water is used to manufacture manyproducts that human beings use. Three quarters of the Earth is believed to be water. There are various sources of waterinclude brooks, rivers, springs, waterfalls, oceans, and seas. Man-made water sourcesinclude water dams, artesian wells and deep wells. Thus, water is everywhere;however, not for long. This is because of global warming as well as the improper useof most water sources. For instance, most people misuse water and waste it byallowing it to continuously flow in faucets even when not in use.It is very important that the water that we drink as well as use for our daily activities isclean. Clean water means being free from chemicals and germs. More so, cleanwater should be clear instead of cloudy. Potable water is the term used to describewater that is safe to drink. Based on history, there may have been hundreds, if not,thousands of people who may have died due to contaminated or polluted water.Clean water is very important when it comes to survival. Although storing water inlarge quantities may be one of the primary steps included in a contingency plan, youstill need to have knowledge on how to make water potable and usable. In today’smodern world, only a few people have the initiative to store water before, during, andafter a disaster or survival situation.In almost all circumstances, it is always best to be prepared and knowledgeable. Given that it can be difficult to find pure water due to the advent of differenttechnologies that make use of harmful chemicals and substances, affecting naturalwater sources, it is advisable to know how to make water potable and usable.Prior to going through a survival or emergency situation, it is recommended to prepareeverything you need for water supply. For instance, it would be nice to have a basicceramic filter in handy. Although it is a simple way to eliminate bacteria, it can be veryefficient. It is also good to stock up on bleach. As mentioned in previous sections, bleach isefficient in filling many types of microorganisms that are harmful to your health. Boiling water, as repeatedly discussed in most sections, is the safest and most efficientmethod to purify water. As such, you need to have knowledge on how to boil water theproper way. In addition, you also prepare the things that you might need for boilingwater in case of emergency or survival situations. Naturally, you need a pot of water toboil for at least a minute. Let the water cool until the temperature is ready for drinking."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Most third world countries are already using five-gallon buckets for their water filtrationsystems. Making use of five-gallon buckets is the cheapest and simplest filtrationsystem yet can be very efficient specifically when combined with local materials suchas bio-sand filter. Based on studies, this filter has proven to eliminate 90-99.9% ofharmful contaminants and disease-spreading agents. More often than not, this type offilter can eliminate a large amount of heavy metals from water. In other countries, themost common filtration systems that are being used include solar disinfection andchlorination. These systems are considered less effective yet cost more than otherfiltration systems.Given that you cannot tell when you might encounter an emergency or survivalsituation, it is best to be equipped with knowledge on how to build your own waterfiltration system. For instance, you can build a five-gallon bucket bio-sand filtrationsystem by using pieces of PVC pipes and buckets.On the other hand, if you want to come prepared for any given circumstance that maynecessitate for water, it is recommended to build a long-lasting filtration system similarto a Berkey-style filter. You would also need 5-gallon buckets for this but would saveyou as much as $100 instead of buying a full filtration unit. To get you motivated, you should always bear in mind that your life and the lives ofyour loved ones are at stake if you drink and use contaminated water. It is best neverto take chances. Know your water source and the type of contaminants that may bepresent in it. Learn the proper ways to build even a simple water filtration system thatyou could use in any given situation, normal circumstances or emergency situations.
