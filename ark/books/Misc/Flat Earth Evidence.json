Some may view the debate of whether the earth is flat or not to be a take it or leave it discourse and while t hat would be the socially acceptable response to agree to I’m afraid that I cannot. There are few t hings more fundamental than fully understanding the s ignificance of what we stand on each day and t hat holds the air for our next breath of life. It’s no t a political argument that can be dialed out of because we’re tired of it, because f ace it , we’ve all been elected to know where we stand on this issue by due point of the fact that we live on this rock. We need to know everything there is to know about the domain that we live in and more importantly for me as a Christian man I need to know whether or not I can trust God, because regardless of what anyone’s opinion may be the Bible is quite simply a Flat E arth book. So for me to believe in a Flat Earth has now come to be a belief, and while it may not be the belief of many yet, it is for the brave ones that this book is dedicated to for their courage to ask the questions and pursue the facts that so many wi sh to either ignore or deny.

By no means should anything written on the pages of this book be simply believed at face value. No, this book is meant to challenge you and make you ask questions, the questions that will arise about almost every- thing, because when you realize that you we re lied to about one thing of such epic proportion s as whether the earth is flat or not, then you immediately begin to question the paradoxi- cal reality of just how much else is there that you haven’t been told the real deal about. For far too long we mode rn humans have been believing things with no comprehension of why we believe them other than for the fact that we were told to believe them and out of misguided trust and media rich subliminal programming, we did.

Life doesn’t happen in a vacuum, but for many they have chosen to live out their existences without ever questioning the reality of the many inconsistencies there are with the offi- cial story that we’ve all been taught as if it were a religion . A reli gion wherein it is considered the height of blasphemy to question even one small part of it , because the people in the know are so well educated and respectable that it’s just absurd to believe that so many of them could lie about something so big . As an a uthor my answer to the question of the believabil- ity of such a grand cover - up scheme is to answer it with a story. Once upon a time there was a World War and several dec- ades later it was followed by another World War. In this later war there was to be a m assive invasion of Axis Power con- trolled Europe by Allied forces based in Great Britain later to be known as operation D - Day. It’s a true story folks. It is also a regrettably true story that five weeks before the big invasion there was a practice rehear sal done meant to sim- ulate real battle conditions titled Operation Tiger. The re- hearsal was set to take place on a British beach in a mock war game exercise meant to prepare US soldiers for storming ashore at Utah Beach in Axis controlled Normandy . It was an unmitigated disaster."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" The British opened with live fire on the US landing craft and when the day was done almost a thousand US soldiers were dead on the beach. In a twist of raw irony more soldiers died in this rehearsal, then later died in the actual invasion of Utah Beach in Normandy. These events are tragic just left as they are, but the story continues. None of the wounded sol- diers were allowed to talk about what happened. The bodies of the dead were thrown into a mass grave and left there to rot un til after the D - Day invasion took place on June 6, 1944 . The bodies were then secretly exhumed between July and August of that year and put on coffin trains where the bodies were presumably shipped back to the US and passed off as D - Day operation casualti es. The secret of what took place 5 week s before D - Day was kept under wraps for almost 40 years after the war and indeed most people reading this have prob- ably never heard of this event and truly I’ve listed down the official narrative as it currently exis ts, but some sources claim that over 2,000 soldiers were killed that day, which if true would make it comparable in terms of loss to Pearl Harbor. My point in relaying this true story is that this tragic mili- tary blunder was covered up at the highest leve l by Dwight D. Eisenhower, himself , a future president, and not a word was breathed of it for nearly 40 years. This is the same government that yearly issues 40 billion dollars in funding to an agency whose employees are publicly on record as stating that we no longer have the ability to go to the moon because the advanced tinfoil technology of the 1960’s has been mysteriously lost.

Some of the best Flat Earth proofs for a Flat Earth are found in the seat of an airplane. I especially like these proofs because not every- one is going to go out and try to recreate all the experiments there are to prove the many points brought up by this book , but most people in the modern swing of things at some point are going to sit in the seat of a plane or already have done so quite frequently. Before we get to planes though, let’s first ponder some of the official ly accepted facts that NASA an d other scientific sources say define the oblate spheroid al shape that they say the Earth resembles. These accepted ‘facts’ to define the sub- stance of your daily existence of contact with tera firma are theirs and not mine . Here they are: 1) Earth has a diameter of 7,918 miles 2) Earth has a circumference of 24,902 miles at the equa- tor . 3) Earth is located 93 million miles from the sun 4) It takes light from the sun 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach earth."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 5) The earth spins approximately 1,000 miles per an hour at the equator. 6) The sun is 109 times larger in diameter than the earth . 7) The moon is only one quarter the size of the earth’s diameter . 8) The moon’s shine is light from the sun that is being reflected off of its surface , which in turn makes it vis- ibl e on earth. It produces no light of its own. 9) The earth rotates around the sun at 67,000 miles per an hour, which breaks d own to about 18.5 miles per a sec- ond. 10) An approximation of the weight of all the water in the earth’s oceans/seas is 1.45 Quintillion tons (18 zeros). 11) Earth exists in a solar system wit h 8 or 9 other planets and is traveling through space around the Milky W ay Galaxy at 515,000 miles per an hou r. 12) Given the dimensions of earth as provided by NASA the following in terms of curvature to determine the fall off from a straight line of sight can be represented mathematically in the following distance comparisons. - 1 mile = . 67 feet of fall over the hori zon ( otherwise known as the vanishing point) - 5 miles = 16.67 feet of fall over the horizon - 10 miles = 66.69 feet of fall over the horizon - 20 miles = 266.75 feet of fall over the horizon - 50 miles = 1,667.17 feet of fall over the horizon - 100 miles = 6,668.14 feet of fall over the horizon"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" - 1,000 miles = 663,337.65 feet of fall over the hori- zon. 13) The Milky W ay Galaxy is traveling through the cos- mos at 1.43 million miles per an hour . I could go on, but let’s keep it at these commonly recog- nized and current scient ific community supported facts as taught in modern academia and which form the basis for the belief of what the majority of everyone in the current age is being told to believe as the quite literal body of facts that de- fine their existence on earth. I can ’t help but ask the potentially skeptical reader of this book this hypothetical question: If an individual was raised apart in modern society without any knowledge of NASA or space flight and so on and had this list defining the earth set before them what do you think their reaction would be? For instance, how could they prove any of what they’d been told? In actuality how many items on the list are you able to personally prove? My guess is none. So if you’re reading this book coming from a perspective of having always believed in a ‘ball earth’ then please take a moment and consider with some levity that you believe what you do about the earth being round (oblate spheroid) as a mat- ter of faith. Having faith i s perfectly fine, even commendable, but believing the earth is round based off what NASA and others have said is still just a belief , a belief, in that everything they’ve been telling you for the last 70 years or so is true."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" The exception to this would be if you could personally prove that the earth is round. I cannot prove the earth is round. I can, however prove that it is not. In truth, I do not have all the answers, but the ones I do tell me that a lot of people’s faith has been placed entirely in the wrong place and it’s high time that people pursued the truth as ardently as they once did and still can if they keep an open mind and apply some critical thinking skills.

I had a great deal of faith in what I had always been told by ... well, everyone. The biggest chink in my defensive mindset of rejecting sound arguments in favor of dogmatic belief in the tradi- tional and accepted view of the earth came when I watched a flat earth video on star charts. I was literally blown away by the simplicity of the truth to be realized that literally couldn’t be explained away no matter how one wanted to stretch things in order to stay in a ni ce cozy cocoon of blissfully blind trustfulness of the authorities that be. To put it simply the profoundness of star charts/ star movement is this. Every day, day after day, year after year, all the stars in the heavens rotate around Polaris, the North Sta r. If you set a slow time release camera up and focus it at the night sky, it will show you star trails that perfectly orbit the North Star. The rhythm never changes. It is a fact, this really happens and is availa- ble for analysis by every step of the scie ntific process. The problem for a ball earth enthusiast is that what takes places"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" in the sky every day simply is impossible to be replicated on a spinning ball hurtling through space. Why? Because any- one on earth can look up and observe the circular path o f the stars orbiting the North Star and indeed the earth itself . (Note: The reason different constellations are viewable in different areas of the earth has everything to do with the lim- itations of human eyesight and nothing to do with evidence for norther n and southern hemispheres.) If the earth was spinning the only place on earth that you could get a look at the night sky and see what is to be seen night after night is if you were standing on the very top of the north pole and even then the perspective w ould be warped some and you would not see the perfect cylindrical paths the stars make each night as well as during the day. If the picture of the differing perspectives coming into play still isn’t clear in your mind then by all means get out there and ta ke a peek at the many graphics and videos that have been compiled on this one flat earth evidence alone. To investigate hurts no one, but to choose to remain ignorant after a question has been raised that you have no answer for is frankly dumb and I’m not dumb and I hope you aren’t either .

Three primary problems need to be answered. 1) If satellites orbit the earth, then why are their coverage dead zones over the oceans? Do the orbiting satellites that have to cross over the oceans anyway in their geocentric or- bits just switch off as to conserve battery or something and then snap back on and begin broadcasting again when land- fall gets close again ? It’s a bit much to be believed isn’t it , but how else does one describe the vast coverage dead zones over the oceans ? 2) Did you know that in terms of the Internet conductivity between continents that most of it is done almost e xclusively through undersea cables? This would explain why the coun- try of Australia almost lost their entire connection to the In- ternet for a month in 2016 when one of only three undersea cables feeding information to the country got snapped in an underwat er fault zone. Where are the satellites? How is an entire modern nation almost plunged into unconnected dark- ness by one little undersea cable getting snapped? Oh, that’s right , undersea cables between countries/continents amount for 99.9 percent of data ex change d internationally . What ex- actly do satellites do again? I mean Google doesn’t even seem to use them anymore as it focuses on flying planes and wrapping its undersea cables in an anti - shark metallic mesh because sharks are irresistibly drawn to bite t heir cables. Also, don’t forget all those miles and miles of fiber optic ca- ble strewn across the country buried deep in the median strips of major highways. Oh, and by the way, did you know that ‘they’ say it’ s easier, faster and less expensive to lay an u nderwater sea cable into the ocean depths greater than Mt.

It really begs the question of, ‘Are we actually getting smarter or not?’ 3) America loves its satellite TV to be sure. It can be hard to find a house that doesn’t have a TV dish perched on the side of it angled at the sky. The dishes alw ays point in specific di- rections because that’s where the satellite is located . ???? As previously mentioned the earth is spinning really , really fast and the satellite’s going on in its own unique journey , but having a dish pointed in a particular directi on at all times al- ways grabs in that signal to keep the tube going full blast or..... or are all the dishes instead being pointed at a firma- ment dome that hovers over a flat earth set in place by an all powerful Creator? Are all the dishes receiving their tr ans- mission signal s by collecting it as it is being deflected at dif- fering trajectories off the dome at the top of the world kind of like playing racket ball in an enclosed room at the gym ? Would this be why satellite dish receivers nearer to the equa- tor po int straight up (the highest part of the dome, while fur- ther away locations have to angle the dishes over farther in order to catch a signal?

According to NASA and other scien- tific sources, there are varying levels of the atmosphere and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" who knows, maybe t here are, but to get to the point, satel- lites exist in their orbits in a region called the Thermosphere. Not a very nice place as it has temperatures ranging from 900 to almost 4,000 degrees F. The problem as to whether satellites even exist gets thrown in to greater peril when one considers that there are only about seven elements on the Pe- riodic Table that can withstand such temperatures and not melt and satellites aren’t comprised of any of the se elements . So how do you put a hunk of high tech gadgetry in to an area of the atmosphere where all the elements, it’s comprised of will easily melt, but somehow magically it doesn’t? Some defenders of the existence of satellites insist that it’s because the intense radiation in this level of atmosphere closer to th e sun has a cooling effect instead of a heat ing effect . Reall y? How about that. I’ll try to remember that one if someone does indeed push the proverbial Cold War Doomsday button someday . Maybe that’s what the phrase, ‘When hell freezes over.’ is referring to. Other defenders of this admittedly tricky issue for satellites insist that the satellites survive be- cause they radiate so much of the absorbed heat away so even though the satellite is sitting in an oven hot enough to melt it – it somehow rises above and radiates away more of the ‘ heatness ’ than it is receiving , outward from itself pre- serving itself in...... . in ... um, yeah I don’t g e t how that one works. Pies placed in the oven due tend t o bake through and through eventually. The most important thing to remember though is that somehow about 50 years ago we sent actual human beings through this layer of the atmosphere and they didn’t melt. Maybe the loss of the technology to get through thi s hurdle of the earth’s atmosphere in route to the moon could explain the mysterious loss of sound logic to explain exactly why elements left in an oven hot enough to melt them don’t actually melt even as the international space sta- tion has somehow managed to do this for around 15 years now."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Evidence to Consider # 9 Space: Squirrels – Inhabitants of Mars? Situation: On September 28 th back in 2012 NASA released a photo to the public taken by the Curiosity Rover depicting the red tinted barren landscape that we have been condi- tioned to believe is what Mars looks like. The problem is that several intrepid souls over the years have matche d up the scenery from Mars photographs as being a dead ringer for the Mojave Desert located in Nevada and California sans a little red tint to the photoshopped outcome. While it could be argued that Mars and the Mojave Desert scapes look re- markably similar, what can’t be refuted easily at all by NASA is why is the re a Mojave ground squirrel in their pho- tograph. NASA refuses to address the fact that the squirrel is in their photo maintaining that the climate of Mars is com- pletely inhospitable for animal growt h with an atmosphere of 95.32 percent Carbon Dioxide.

Then suddenly some- thing changes and the lawn around you shadows and with re- lief you feel a let up on the intensity of the heat that ha s been bearing down relentlessly up on you. With gratitude, you look up at the white fluffy cloud that has temporarily blocked out the sun from its steady torture of you. With re- morse you see the cloud is a small one and in the passage of a couple more seconds the cloud has moved on and there you are baking in the sun again. The feeling of returning heat is an instant one isn’t it. As previously noted, thoug h NASA is on the books as saying that a light photon given off from the sun takes 8 minutes and twenty seconds to reach earth . When the cloud moved away you felt the heat of the sun again in- stantly didn’t you. Now the counter argument is likely to be that because the sun is so far away and the cloud so much closer to you that the exchange only appears to be instant be- cause things are moving so fast. Maybe. However can propo- nents of that belief explain why people prone to sunburn, indeed anyone for that matt er, get the worst sunburns on cloudy days? The essence of the sun is still coming through the cloud. Let’s take it out further still – solar eclipses. If you’ve seen one then you’ve seen how the light of the sun is instantly restored as the moon moves on p ast. Again, how is this possible ? Where’s the delay in the sunlight like there now is in a Super Bowl halftime show being aired ‘ live ’ so in the event of another Janet Jackson breast baring debacle they can shut things down before the feed enters your tube in the living room? The feedback delay simply doesn’t happen in nature. As the moon moves past the sun the light of the sun is instantly there upon you being reflected on the ground around you.

Situation: NASA and the scientific community at large tell us that the moonlight shining down on us is reflected light from the sun. If you believe this then answer the quandary of this observable fact that you can go out and measure for yourself. During t he day the temperature under the shade of a tree is cooler than it is out in the open field next to it that is being exposed to direct sunlight. The observable twist with moonlight, though is that it is the opposite. It is warmer in the shade than out in t he open that is being bathed in direct moonlight. If moonlight was reflected sunlight , then even i n reduced heat tones it should be reacting just the same as sun- light impacts the environment during the day does, but the thing is the heat of moonlight is tr anslucent and heats up those spaces that the sun skips over in the daytime. Beyond that, if you do research and weed through a lot of by the book faithful to the status quo rhetoric you will discover that when analyzed objectively that even the wavelengths of the two light sources are different from one another and not re- producible over into the other as in the case of sunlight being converted over into the actual wavelengths of light given off by the moon. As a Christian the moon being the source of its ow n light makes perfect sense after all, didn’t God say in the beginning that He made, the greater light to rule the day and the lesser lights to rule the night. He made no mention of the lesser lights being reflected light off of the greater light, but pose d them as individual sources of light un to themselves. I will admit to some serious concerns I have about the moon as it has s everal inconsistencies about it .

As I state d at the beginning of this hand book – I can’t necessarily prove that the earth is indeed flat, because I simply don’t know everything and haven’t been everywhere , but I can prove that the earth isn’t either round or a spheroid shape hurtling through space. That’s bet- ter than NASA trying to quell speculation that the m oon landings were all faked by donating ‘moon rocks’ to muse- ums and universities o nly to later have it come out that all the samples given were verified as being native of earth origin material. A lie spoken boldly enough and propped up by the high and mighty of society is convincing, but when analyzed as in the case of all these donate d moon rocks can easily be turned out for the lie it is. If questioning the reality of either your planetary existence or that of a flat stationary existence where Earth is the center of the cosmos with heaven positioned directly above it and hell beneath it is still too much to contemplate then ask yourself why you should trust someone implicitly with something vitally important that only they can verify and tell you is true or not ? The moon rocks have been proven to be fake. The shadows are all wrong in t he original moon landing film s , which by the way ha ve since disappeared along with all the advanced technology of the 1960’s to the point that current day NASA officials go on camera and publicly admit that they don’t know how to safely convey human life t hrough the radiation fields of the Van Allen Belts.

The mathematical problem presented, however though is that the farther out the viewed in perspective is the faster the action should be the closer in you get to the action. In other words your view of the clouds passing by overhead should be one of seeing them pass by at warp speed at something like MACH 10 in order to account for how a perspective taken fr om so far out in space surveilling over a much greater area should look like given the fast rate of movement NASA shows the cloud swaths moving at.

Situation: In the m odern realms of construction an ancient tool, the plumbob, used for finding and accurately setting the vertical plane of a building has been replaced with bubble and laser levels that you can pick up at any hardware store. You can make a plumbob for yourself though if you need one. You simply tie something chunky and heavy to one end of a rope and let the weight hang free. Ta DA ! You have a perfectly vertical line to measure off of curtsy of the string and with a right angle tool line d up with the string you can also find the horizontal level plane as well. Now a ball earth enthusiast will explain this simple method of finding the vertical axis as a result of the heavily magnetic earth’s core exerting an intense gravitational pull on the heavy object. Sounds like a plausible idea, but lik e many round madly spinning earth beliefs , it completely falls apart when put into action. How, you ask?"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" Allow me to construct the following scenario. The dimensions of a New York City block vary a good bit, but an average size of one is 264 feet by 900 fe et. There are also quite a few build- ings in New York City that take up an entire city block as well. So let’s say we’re constructing one of these big buildings. I’ve got contractors setting steel I - beam supports on either end of this eventual 900 foot wid e by 20 stories tall modern mono- lith. The foreman on each side is using a level held in the ver- tical position placed on the I - beam because this is going to be a big building and everything had better be leveled and that means it needs to be checked, checked again and triple checked. Neither foreman is happy until their beams are ex- actly level in all four cardinal directions in terms of their up- right beam being centered on the vertical axis. Satisfied they build the rest of the building and join it all togeth er and when complete it stands an impressive 20 stories tall in the air. Now if the earth was round , or spheroid for the purists out there , imagine the complete consternation of those two foreman as they are standing back and viewing a structure that is si gnifi- cantly wider at its top floor then it is at the ground pla ne or street level floor. What on earth happened? First off I should ask, “Have you ever seen a building shaped like this? ” No, I haven’t either and it’s because the earth is flat. In a building of this size, although really the effects would be seen in any building, the curvature of the earth in the course of that 900 foot width is significant. There would be a difference of sev- eral inches of curvature ov er that span.

Now the difference in the tra- jectories is only a difference of several inche s on the ground plane, but the next story up you go as those vertical beam lines continue to angle away from each other as they gain altitude adds a few more inches of separation and then the floor above that has a difference of over a foot and so on and s o on. By the time you reach the twentieth floor you have what looks like an upside down step pyramid . This is true reality folks. Just because I know some people will ask – no – there is no curva- ture formula that high - rise architects down to your local res i- dential house builder uses to account for earth curvature gains across every foot in elevation traveled. The true reality of con- struction on earth is that if your structure ’ s supports are level (plum) on the ground plain and you carry them upwards in heig ht in the same fashion the supports for the roof corners of your building are not going to be any wider apart from end to end than the same supports located below them in the base- ment.

So if they weren’t stupid and in actuality were quite brilliant and able to construct marvels of engineering that have lasted to the present day, whose secrets are still be- ing revealed , then why has all modern academia completely thrown out the real ity that every one of these cultures is a flat earth believing culture within their own myths of origins? All these past cultures feature a sun that moves around a flat sta- tionary earth that has a domed ceiling. These ancients who placed the wonders that h ave persisted over into today long after any modern skyscraper would be a moldering pile of rust and mold weren’t using earth curvature calculations to discern distances or building mechanisms/locations based off of dis- tant star constellations because at t he core of their belief sys- tem was a flat earth. Don’t believe me then look it up and educate yourself. Every past culture from the Old Testament believing Hebrews w a ndering in the desert with Moses to the records of the royal Chinese observatory scribes w hich have left us detailed records of thousands of years of past celestial events that spans the lengths of multiple Chinese dynasties, all witness to a belief in an earth that doesn’t move and a sun and a moon that do.

Any archeologists or professors reading this – have you ever applied earth curvature formulas in your interpretations of how past cultures came up with 2+2 = 4? Seriousl y, think about the gap in logic occurring here. Modern academia acknowledges the Egyptians were a flat earth believing cul- ture and yet they credit them profusely with the flawless placement of the pyramids based off of celestial mathematical alignment calc ulations, flat earth based calculations at that . Now how does modern math with so many NASA added in integers still add up to 4? That’s because the math has never changed. We can verify that the pyramids are perfectly placed mathematically because it’s the same math, but in a modern global world that simply shouldn’t be the case. Why are ar- cheologists , civil engineers, and university researchers still lost in the paradigm that every ship navigational map both past and current is a flat earth map? The math s hould have changed to reflect curvature. It had to, but it didn’t. Someone is lying. A lot of someone’s too. Ancient people weren’t stupid. Their architecture will easily outlast our own.

Not such a bad idea now is it to ra ke out grid lines all across your home- land to let your countrymen know where water is to be had with the least amount of digging. Lines that are now thousands of years old and have well outlasted the culture that depended on them. In America we have sectio ns of interstate highways that are bypassed for better routes and within fifty years you would not be able to even tell there had once been a 4 lane paved highway in existence there and yet these lines in the desert are kept clean of all debris by the dese rt winds because in addition to being water markers they are also energy ley lines and the accumulation of debris upon them is actually re- pelled from doing so somehow.

In other words, if I want to burn myself out I can raise it up to an incline of 20+ percent if I so desire. Now another case for a flat earth or perhaps better put , an understandable context of proof occurred to me. Imagine instead of punishing myself with an incline of the slope I in- stead keep the treadmill leveled off at 0 percent and jog/walk for five miles. The treadmill is perfectly level. The built in pedomete r is keeping track of my real - time pace, which will determine how soon I reach the deadline of having traveled a distance of 5 miles . If I stop walking it stops. I start up again, it starts up again. Following me? Now imagine a 5 mile stretch of road locat ed in Kansas next to a corn field. The terrain is flatter than a pancake so to speak. If you’ve ever been to Kan- sas you know what I mean. You can literally see a ground hog stand up on his back legs at a thousand yards . Oh, wait – that’s probably impossibl e according to NASA to see that. Anyway , imagine walking that 5 mile stretch of road with your pedom- eter clicking away at your side. What are the differences in the two scenarios? On the treadmill you didn’t go anywhere, so earth ’s curvature wasn’t an issu e. But out on the blacktop over a span of five miles you’ve fallen over the horizon a distance"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" of 16.67 feet according to NASA. Your path of journey is not a straight vector line, but actually an arching one and yet the pedometer on your hip tells you when you’ve reached your quota of a 5 mile hike. On a round earth you are now faced with a quandary. Your pedometer measures your actual dis- tance traveled and it says you’ve gone five miles. The pedom- eter only measures the distance traveled and not the route c hosen. But NASA says you’ve been dropping over the hori- zon by over 16’ feet. So is 5 miles on a tread mill a longer distance than 5 miles on a flat country road in Kansas that has to account for curvature incurred that was not experienced on the level plan ed treadmill ? If you say no then the reality is that you have to draw a straight line that cuts through the surface of the earth in order to connect your departure point with your destination point in order to say your journey outside is equal in distance traveled to your five mile journey at 0 percent slope aspect on your treadmill at home. Now if you draw this line through the surface of the globe your left with another incongruity – all the extra territory covered in your travele d arch from Point A to Po int B measured in height above the straight line trajectory equal to the path traveled on the tread- mill. Now the argument becomes, ‘Is your actual distance walking in a straight line outdoors more than if you’d just jogged inside your house on a machine th at never approaches any closer to the horizon.?’ How many of you out there who regularly jog outdoors have been told, “Oh don’t worry about getting your whole 5 miles in today .

Who knew the actual distance of a marathon is more like 30 miles traveled or so than the distance of 24 miles that they’ve always told us that it was. Okay, I’m being sarcastic, but do you see how easily everything you’ve been told falls apart with some simpl e observational analysis.

Notice to o in the photos that the horizon is flat and I mean really flat. Well, basically just as flat as it is everywhere, but there you can really get an appreciation for it. As the law of perspectives go if you were to raise up in elevation over that salt flat in something like a hot air balloon that straight hori- zon line would rise with you because the horizon rises accord- ing to the perspective of the viewer just as when you look out a plane window and see a flat horizon line. This is the reality of what you see, but if the earth was round and you kept going up in elevation in that hot air b alloon you should start seeing the edges of the horizon tailing off as earth curves, but as many high altitude balloon tests review the farther up you go the straight horizon line goes along with it and there is no cur- vature of earth to be detected whatsoe ver.

Evidence to Consider # 29 Basic Physics : Trains – They Exist"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Situation: Growing up I had the opportunity to be on a lot of trains curtsy of my father’s obsession with them. Admit- tedly the model train set that took up half the basement was kind of fun , even if every vacation we took seemin gly had to have at least one train ride fit into it somehow. So I am a bit of an expert in that I can say quantifiably that trains do indeed exist on this earth because I have multiple firsthand experi- ence s on a wide assortment of riding upon them from ste am powered to heavy commercial diesel and electric engines. Trains exist. Every day they move across the earth and to this day they move more cargo about in a more efficient manner than any other method known to man. This is reality. The re- ality, though on earth as NASA would have you to believe that the earth exists as means, though at the most basic of lev- els that no railway system in the world could exist and much less function as it does. Why is this? Well, train wheels don’t come with tread on them. T hey're smooth. The ability of a train to go up grades in elevation has much to do with the ini- tial inertia of weight in motion before arriving at an uphill grade. Train tracks in general are kept on the level as much as possible because there is simply no way for them to function with heavy cargo payloads on too steep of a grade. That’s why the tunnels are blasted through the mountains and the train trestle bridges rise up high over the valleys and rivers below where possible . NASA’s basic earth curvature c alculations ar- rive at gradients of steepness that basic cargo trains that on average measure 6,600 (over a mile) feet long could never begin to even think of accomplishing, and that’s just on the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" level areas, which what is level on a ball earth anyway. To add even more dimensions to this the distance of some freight trains can be 4 times longer than the distance mentioned with the use of additional engines being employed. The incongruity of a spinning ball in comparison to the existence of trains op- erating as they do is a very well - known real ity that people in the train industry have known about for a very long time and have spoken out about, but seemingly no one cares for the simple truth of the reality of the physics involved in terms of what a train can do and not do. The reason for this is probably quite best summed up by the power of media propaganda, best illustrated by the Nazi’s propaganda minister Joseph Goeb- bels . Here are three quotes by him in terms of media propa- ganda. First Quote - “ The best propaganda is that which, as it were, w orks invisibly, penetrates the whole of life without the public having any knowledge of the propagandistic initia- tive. ” Second Quote - “Propaganda is not a matter for average minds, but rather a matter for practitioners.

The point of a political speech is to persuade peo- ple of what we think right.

Propaganda should be popular, not intellectually pleasing. It is not the task of propaganda to discover intellectual truths.

I don’t really see it that way because the assump- tions made in regards to this effect are all measured off of NASA’s view of the earth and there believed rotation of it. In fact the rotation of earth is the whole basis for them insisting that this effect is in existence and thus earth must be round and moving because of it. A bit reminiscent of the faulty prac- tice of circular reasoning wouldn’t you say? Most basically put the effect stipulates that in the northern hemisphere water will spin clockwise and in the southern hemisphere water spins counterclockwise. There you have it folks, the single best example for why the earth is round and spinning a thou- sand miles per hour in one direction. Hmm . Question: So why can I get my sink to drain in a counterclockwise fashion based on the direction of my in - pour of water, while my toi let drains clockwise because the inflow of water is focused to come in on the one side of the bowl ? Kind of a quandary wouldn’t you say within just the bounds of a house located in the northern hemisphere? The toilet bowl inflow jets are molded to bring th e water in at the angle to create a spiral clockwise flow. When I reverse position and pour water into my sink from the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" opposing angle of inflow as found in my toilet I get a counter- clockwise spiral of water down the drain. Conclusion: The Coriolis Effect does not exist in my house. But what about storm systems moving one way above the equator and the other way below the equator. Well, I ’m not quite sure, but my guess is it could have something to do with wind patterns. Sounds more plausible of a solution t han to suggest it’s caused by the spin of the ground under my feet at approximately Mach 1.5. But hey, if you want to hold onto a belief in a spin- ning ball from your interpretation of a rumored effect that can be disproven by an average guy within his own home then by all means go ahead. When matters are a bit up for debate as they are in this matter, I encourage people to use the wisdom found in a philosophical approach utilizing a principle known as Occam’s Razor. Essentially, it is a means of logistical anal- ysis that when presented with two diverging theories for the same cause and effect of an event that you should side with the theory that assumes less overall logistical issues, because in general the theory that assumes the fewest amounts of un- knowns i n order to support its conclusions is the one most closely linked to the true reality of the situation being ob- served. Flat Earth: Weather systems spin the other way below the equator because the causation of wind patterning (sun and moon effects) are diff erent then above the equator. Ball Earth: Weather patterns spin differently in the South- ern Hemisphere then they do in the Norther Hemisphere be- cause earth must be spinning a 1,000 miles per hour at the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" equator, rotating at 67,000 miles per hour around the sun and yet holding onto the orbit of a moon that effects and controls the global tides of earth and yet is not ripped away from earth by the greater gravitational mass of the sun because of the in- ertial swing of the planets around the sun, while the sola r sys- tem is spinning through the Milky Way galaxy at 515 ,000 miles per hour and this galaxy on ly being one of an in- fetesimial number of galaxies all awash in a greater cosmos that no one can entirely explain or measure and yet in which human entities do in great detail in so much that they have the ability to halt the whole process and let a high powered tele- scope that has never taken a picture of earth, but exists in space and was allowed to stare uninterrupted into space once for 10 days straight on a nar row line trajectory of view that can’t be measured but has been done so much as the spin of earth has been conquered successfully by NASA and the launch of several thousand orbiting satellites , including an in- ternational space station that people even live on when it along with the theory of gravity has never been proven in an actual scientific based study of any kind. And there you have a brief comparison of the basis behind two theories as to why storms spin in different directions. Which theory do you th ink assumes the least amount of un- knowns?

Usually when this happens, it’s a good indicator of advanced dementia in a person wouldn’t you say? Evidence to Consider # 32 Physics: Artificial Pla nes tell the Truth - Always Situation: This is the last non - Biblical based evidence I’m going to submit as to why I believe that the earth is flat and not a spinning rock magically held in orbit around a giant 109 times larger burning star located 93 million miles away that should ea t the earth for breakfast every day of the week due to its greater gravitational pool and yet it’s the gravitational pull of the moon that makes the tides rise and fall and not the gravitational pool of a sun that holds a planet that has a mass 2 and a hal f times larger than all the other planets combined in orbit even farther out then earth is located . Alas, I digress. There is a device that has been in common existence for quite some time . It is basically simple in what it manages to achieve. What it achi eves is the creation of an artificial pla ne , a straight, level pla ne that is invisible to the eye, but one that exists nonetheless . This device is known as a gyroscope and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" you will find one in almost every plane that flies today. Why? Well, because as a pilot you need to know how you’re orien- tated in the air. Visibility in a fog bank or a storm is v irtually nonexistent at times and without some fail safe means of knowing where you’re at you could be unintentionally aiming the plane down towards the ground or even up into space or as I would have it the upper reaches of a domed atmosphere, which, if you didn’t stop in time to avoid you would smash into, which there being several private funded rocket example explosions in existence to testify to ( Yet another proof for you to look up). So a gyroscope is critical as it’s the eyes of a pilot when visibility is nothing or being greatly impaired. As a de- vice, it has no circuitry, no uplink to ground control, or any- thing remotely digital to it in its purest form. It does its j ob of showing where a level plane orientation is, even if the plane is doing barrel rolls. The gyroscope spins free of constraint to show the pilot where level is so he can even back out in the air once the maneuver is completed . So pict ure this. A pilot brings a 747 up to cruising altitude. He levels off, enters in his coordinates and the autopilot takes over. The thing about it though is that during its entire time at cruising altitude the plane remains leveled off to the gyroscope ’s ar tificial pla ne of the horizon . Maybe you can see the picture of what would be happening if the earth was a planet and maybe not, but to de- scribe to you, what would be occurring would be to say that the plane is on a steady course into outer space as it fol lows the leveled off artificial horizontal pla ne of the gyroscope. Here is the definition of the word horizontal, “parallel to the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" plane of the horizon; at right angles to the vertical.” At no time does a gyroscope account for earth curvature and bend down in order to orchestrate the plane’s navigational equipment to keep nosing the plain down every five minutes to account for earth curvature.

Ask yourself, h ow is an hour’s worth of time, so expanded within the consciousness of a sea captain near the equator than it would be for a dog sled operator with in a tiny little square to work with near the Nort h Pole? And this doesn’t even begin to take into effect how much extra territory is being traveled across within the same unit measurement of time.

What is interesting to speculate upon is that in the book of Genesis , the first two verses can be better interpreted in He- brew to say that the earth became a ruin before being recreated by God during the six day creation week and when it says God sent H is S pirit to hover over the waters the Hebrew word for ‘ hover ’ means to vibrate. So if you had a cold light less environment and suddenly you add intense vibration would it not potentially serve as a catalyst to break up a permanent ice sheet across the face of a flat world that had previously fallen into ruin? Such a violent upheaval of vibration could have pro voke d a geothermal re- lease of heat and magma that could have up thrust the land out of the water and melted the ice, as well as gone towards cre- ating an atmosphere to effectively restart the process of life occurring within a closed terrarium system?

Admittedly none of us were there, but we do have God’s W ord and that is always what we should base our beliefs off of the most.

Not if the stars are much much much smaller orbs of light than we’ve been told of them to be in size. Even the sun might not be a death sentence if it truly is according to flat earth cal- culations much smaller in size and only about thirty miles away in the sky. Some of the other things to be noted in this verse, though is that the sun seems to be separated away from the other stars in distinction in that it’s only darkened and doesn’t come crashing down and the moon will not give ‘its” light. That’s right, “ its light ”. Not reflected sunlight, but rather its own light. As mentioned previously moonlight is the opposite of sunlight in terms of heating up potential. It is translucent, while the sun is radiant.

You ever wonder where the term ‘ gla ss ceiling ’ came from? I mean, how many structures do you commonly know where you walk in and the entire ceiling is made of glass other than a greenhouse ? So why the emphasis on breaking through it, as being pop- ularized currently in the feminist movement in terms of doing everything men can do? Do we really need to have a female prototype of Nimrod to begin constructing a second tower of Babel to prove all is equal between men an d women on the outright rebellious end of the spectrum of humanity? Again the flat earth concept is not relegated to just me and a few others, but every ancient civilization from the Navajo and Cherokees to the Greeks and the Egyptians believed in their ow n version of a flat stationary earth .

In fact everything is based on explaining everything away that’s come to be by some other means other than the existence of an all powerful Creator. So why do Christians believe them over God? As the Bible says, “ Y ou can’t serve two masters unless you learn to hate the one and love the other . ” Scriptural Proof #10 – Psalms 102:25 “Long ago You established the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.” Personal Observation: When God repeats things, it’s very important and notice should be taken of it. Scriptural Proof #11 – Psalms 104:2 “He wraps Himself in light as if it were a robe, spre ading out the sky like a canopy .” Personal Observation: “ Like a canopy . ” Not a limit- less expanse of space that the Hubble telescope is peering into.

He spread out the heavens. He spread out the earth. The last time I checked a ball is made by clumping things to- gether and not by being spread out on a surface. Scriptural Proof #13 – Isaiah 45:12 “I made the earth, and created man on it. It was My hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.” Personal Observation: Every time, as a Christian , that you disregard a passage like this and participate with the world in the celebration of nature being an aspect of evolution or chance happenstance you are engaging in heresy. Don’t do it. God says that He would rather have you hot or cold than be luke warm.

Do you? Scriptural Proof #15 – Jeremiah 10:12 “He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His understanding.” Personal Observation: It’s not a mystery how things came to be. The Bible tells exactly how, it’s just in both our innate curiosity and in some cases arrogance that we insist we need to know all the particulars of the actual process right here and now and reject the truth of a nything that we can’t fully comprehend or take on faith. That’s why the only way to come to God is as a little child, because a little child really doesn’t understand much. He just knows that Mommy and Daddy love him and when he wakes up, he ’ll have food t o eat.

Scriptural Proof #16 – Zechariah 12:1 “The word of the Lord concerning Israel. A declaration of the Lord, who stretched out the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him..” Personal Observation: Some people may think I’m being repetitive with thes e last several verses, but I’m not. God is being repetitive. Using multiple authors over wide ranging sections of time to keep repeating the same thing. The thing that every Christian needs to accept and proclaim as a point of fact and that is that God mad e everything. A good teacher repeats himself enough times until the student learns the truth and God is the best Teacher of all. Scriptural Proof#17 Deuteronomy 10:14 “The heavens, indeed the highest heavens, belong to the Lord your God, as does the earth and everything in it.” Personal Observation: You really need to pay atten- tion to the implied intents of phraseology. God didn’t say eve- rything on a ball earth belonged to Him. He said that everything “ in ” earth belongs to Him. To be “ in ” something says to be enclosed by something. If you were in a ball, then"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" you wouldn’t be located on it, but if you’re in an enclosed firmament domed earth, well that fits a lot better doesn’t it. Scriptural Proof #18 – Psalms 148:4 “Praise Him, highest heavens, and you w aters above the heavens.” Personal Observation: “ waters above the heavens ” Now that’s a mysterious sounding thing to be sure. Maybe there really is something to the fear the Navajos and native occupants of Australia had for the imagery of the Milky Way Ga laxy in the heavens being a barely healed giant rift in the dome ceiling . As a Bible believing Christian I believe in Noah’s flood completely and when it tells me during the pas- sages of Scripture pertaining to the Flood that the windows of heaven were open ed and water poured down I believe it and maybe the Milk Way Galaxy is very much that scar in the dome shield left to us today to witness to the single greatest wiping out of almost all humanity to that date in time . If this seems to be too incredible for you to believe, then what is your opinion of the cultures who have these ancient handed down traditions detailing such things as having hap- pened in the past? Do you think there stupid? I would hope not. But if they're not stupid then why have you completely dis- regarded what they have to say?

No matter how many facts, sci- entifically backed studies, documentaries, reproducible exper- iments that I and others come up to prove a flat earth, there will always be those who will remain shut off to sound in- struction.

I’m not making this stuff up. Get out there and start doing your own research. I have no evidence to support this following statement, but the rumor is that both the US and the Soviet Union were in complete collaboration with each other in an attempt to break through the Firmament/Dome via nuclear wea pons.

The only problem is that a structure of such monstrous size that they were literally going to be able to storm into the throne room of God in heaven would leave a pretty big debris pile and no such pile exists in Iraq. The primary problem though with Iraq is quite simply put, it is not the center of the earth. The center of the earth is the only place that a tower could access the throne room of God because the Gateway of God is at the very center of the dome.

As long as I can help them or even father new lives into existence, then I have a concrete reason for being in existence. I am truly not a self - centered person. It’s both a positive attribute and a character fallacy as I have a tendency to drain myself of energy on behalf of other s and not care for my own needs as I should. These primary passions and a few other secondary ones were all eventually put to the test as my marriage devolved into deeper chaos brought on by the reality that in order to continue surviving I finally learne d to stop feeding the beast that was materialized into human flesh in the form of my wife. She is a woman as scary as any monster out of a children’s bedtime story could only be , perhaps even more so for her"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" ability to appear as completely normal to the m ajor ity of man- kind on a daily basis. This attribute of hers I find the creepiest of all , along with the reality of how many years it took me to see what I do now in relation to her constant emotional abuse of me . Truly, I am blessed to be alive and that’s as much as I’m willing to say about that. I do have the intent someday to write a book on passive aggressive covert female narcissism as I have certainly experienced my fair share of it up close and personal. For now tho ugh I am simply focused on trying to heal and pick up the pieces of one woman’s epic burnout that has de- stroyed a family and without God’s intervention has the abil- ity yet to ruin each of my children’s lives and in turn even worse yet potentially make them into creatures such as her that feed on other people’s life force of energy because they have none of their own and no ability to generate it for themselves. This anxious hell I experience on behalf of my children is what my life has devolved into on a da ily basis. That said, even in the midst of hell I can truly say to eve- ryone that God will walk right alongside of you even in the midst of it , even if H e won’t remove you from the circum- stances of having to go through it. In terms of the positives of the situation I am living through there are many. I have learned so much both about myself and other people.

The rea lity of my new relationship with God has made me to be a more balanced person and far more self - aware than I ever was before. One of the attributes of a narcissist is that literally every- thing and I mean everything they have ever told you, whether it was about their life, what they thought , or what they be- lieved in, everything – was a lie. I hate lies. It is this reality of having to rebuild life in the chaos resulting from 10 years spent living a lie th at perhaps drives me more than anything else to expo se the truth in what- ever way I can in terms of whatever situation I find it being lied about and the flat earth debate controversy is one of them. This journey of discovering these positives and contending for the truth has at times cost me the greatest p assions of my life. Out of fatigue and other strictures brought on by my wife, I gave up writing for a while. I died a little inside when that happened. In many ways I felt like I had betrayed God, only to find out later that it was less a betrayal of Go d and more of an act of giving up on myself. In some ways I thought my gift of writing would be re- moved from me for forever, only it doesn’t work like that. A gift given by God once given is never taken away. The journey to discover that though, was a very dark tun- nel indeed and yet I am through with that leg of the journey and I writing again and loving it. Praise be to God!"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" The continuing hell of the moment for me though is that while I am finally separated from my worst predator I am now also aft er a lengthy legal battle not in full custody of my chil- dren. Simply put, I failed in court to unmask the d ragon that my wife is on the inside and she it turn won an a cademy award for best actress. The start of legal issues began when one day my wife simp ly left and took our four children with her. I didn’t know where my kids were for over two weeks. I had an emergency custody hearing granted to me by the court and it was by doing this that I was finally able to secure where my children were and have the ability to see them. Over the next six months and two custody hearings that followed my wife did her level best to invoke an image of me in the court’s opinion as that of being a complete whack job. One of the things she insisted upon at the first hearing was that I undergo psychological testing as it was her claiming that I was the crazy one. I consented to the testing and passed with flying colors of complete normality in terms of being a living, breathing human with a h eart in his chest. Sometimes it doesn’t seem to matter if you do what’s asked of you to show others who you are at heart, because, like checking off items on a list my wife one by one twisted out of perspective and used anything she could dredge up from o ur 10 years of being together to make me look like I was unfit to be a parent, while I in return lied about nothing and didn’t respond with any of the same gutter tactics that were being employed against me."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" I stuck to the facts and spoke the truth on eve ry matter as it was brought up and truly within the courtroom setting it was a matter of “ he said / she said ” and though my lawyer was able to corner her on multiple occasions and point out how she had lied previously under testimony it seem s in the grand scheme of things that it has done my case no good. One of the items as might be imagine d that I had leveled off against me like a loaded gun by her lawyer was, “ S o you believe that the earth is flat? ” Response, “ Y es, I do .” That may seem a simple enough answer in retrospect, but I assure you that when you’re in a courtroom setting fighting for the lives of your children that is no simple answer to give. Why? Because it makes you look crazy in the eyes of the broader public is why and in some degree que stions like that and oth- ers attributed to a final ruling by the judge granting my wife with a greater amount of custody of the children than was af- forded to me, along with a tiebreaker advantage in terms of health and education decisions in regards to the children. I am not happy at all with the results of where telling the truth has got me. In fact , my guts are practically eaten out by it both literally and physically. My children are in the hands of a demoness that views them more like ants meant to do her every bidding than chil- dren that I would gladly sacrifice my life for. Did I make the wrong decision in court to answer as I did ? The answer is no."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" Lying is never permissible. If everything was to go down again I would still testify that, “ Y es, I bel ieve the Earth is flat.” Why? Because in the most literal sense of it, I have been tested by God to see where my allegiances are. When I gave up writ- ing to suit the whims of my wife, I gave up on myself for a time. When I testified to the truth as I’ve come to see it and have outlined previously in great detail in this book I actively chose my relationship with God over the love I have for my children. I f ulf illed what Jesus said in Matthew 10:37 “...... The person who loves son or daughter more than M e is not worthy of M e .” I neither lied in court nor did I forsake my faith , and yes, it is now a part of my faith in God in believing that the earth is flat, and this is primarily derived as such because the word of God simply says so if you read it and t ake it at face value , which is the only way God’s words were ever meant to be taken. This is the simple truth of my reality and as a result, my answer in court had to be as simple as, “ Y es, I believe the Earth is flat .” Now to the judge’s credit, she act ually spoke up and asked my wife’s lawyer, “ Y ou actually want to say that he’s unfit to be a parent because he believes the earth is flat ?” I don’t remember the exact response of my wife’s lawyer, but it could be summed up in one word, “ A bsolutely ! ”"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" So t o the reader of this book, yes, believing that the earth is flat and then telling others about it can very well lead to you being called crazy. Worse yet seemingly is the potential to lose what you value most in life out of taking such a stance. I take en couragement in and encourage others to as well in the promise made by Jesus Christ in Matthew 10:39, “ anyone finding his life will lose it and anyone losing his life because of M e will find it.” Another flat earth believer and author, Rob Skiba, who I don ’t know personally, shared his own trials of waking up one day and gradually coming to the conclusion that almost eve- rything he believed about the shape of the earth and the me- chanics of its motion was a lie and that the Earth is flat or at least something very close to it and not going anywhere . He’s the author of several biblically - based books and makes a liv- ing off of his books along with guest presentations on various topics that pertain to his books. He has his own YouTub e channel and in one video he openly shared how Christians, many of them ones he consid- ered to be his friends, literally turned their backs on him when he started talking about a flat earth. His book sales plummeted seemingly overnight . The cost for pursu ing the truth was very high for him, just as it has been for me and I don’t think we are just two isolated stories. I don’t know what the background of the situation was, but one flat Earth YouTube channel, M y P erspective, just disap- peared overnight for months. The channel is back now, but"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" without countless videos that one after the other proved through the use of perspective that a spinning ball simply doesn’t have any basis in either reality or the geometric wa lls of perspective that every artist uses to invoke artistry and this earth that we live on is truly a work of artistry. Many of this channel’s former videos are in backup playlists made by fans of his work and I encourage you to seek them out. Many peopl e talk a lot about the topic of a flat earth , but the number of those who conclusively prove a point with every video released by either mathematical principles, the use of the laws of perspective, or other discernible a nd repro- ducible principles is a bit more rare. As I said I don’t know why his channel went down without any explanation , but I can say that there is an incredible amount of heat even threats of severity of all kinds leveled against the flat e arth believing community. One channel owner showe d results of how YouTube itself deleted or lost 3 million flat e arth search results in a 12 hour span in 2017. The reality of this quest for the truth of what the earth is actually shaped like is no longer just a movement comprised of a few hundred or eve n thousands. Millions of people world- wide are waking up and throwing out old lies that simply won’t do anymore and yes the cost of doing that can be very high. Believing that the earth is flat can and indeed will make things difficult if not hellish for y ou , but if you are a lover of the truth, if you believe that the W ord of God, the Bible, is true , then you have no other choice."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" This book that I’ve written to help convince others of the truth that I have found has hopefully accomplished two things. I ho pe that it has eliminated ignorance. Secondly, I hope it’s made the case for why a Christian has no other choice but to believe a flat earth picture of our created construct because there is no other valid interpretation that differs from what the words o f God say on the topic. My duty as a believer in Jesus Christ is not to conform to the ways of the world, but rather it is my duty to shine the light of the truth that is alive in me with everyone who will listen. What you do with what you hear is on your head. Ridicule me, belittle me, troll me with nasty ins ults, threaten me, or perhaps agree with me – regardless, your de- cision is on your head so make it good, because one way or another you’re going to have to wear it. Whether it’s a crown of disgusting refuse or a crown of honor the decision is in your hands and the journey to further discovery that now lies ahead of you is one best suited with a close relationship with God firmly in place first, because your chances of surviving with- out H im helping you are virtually none. There are many deceptions that take place in this world and the deceptions about this world itself are no less varied , but there is one truth above all others and that is Jesus Christ and what H e did for all of us who walk this earth.

None of us that put all of our trust in God will be disappointed in the end, because my God is not a liar and while my day in an earthly court in contention fo r the livelihood and happiness of my children may be over, my case remains open in the courts of heaven , even as I have a faith in God that just won’t die, even as I have a Savior in Jesus Christ in whom and through whom all things have been made possible to me.

I have written several previous se- ries that all featured space travel and enormous amounts of sci - fi action, but these were all done before I came to an awakening consciousness as to the truth of the ground beneath me . Th ose books do not reflect the true reality that I have come to see as existing now , but they are still very good reads. The books listed below, how- ever began being written as I made my transformation out of being a ball earth believer and as such they may well be the only fictional books on the market that showcase flat earth beliefs of an enclosed and domed world.
