[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1 Sayings of Jesus Some scholars call it “The Lost Gospel of Q” - “Q” standing for Quelle , a German word for “source.” As early as 1838, a German scholar Christian Weisse at the University of Leipzig, developed proof that Matthew and Luke not only copied large parts of their gospels from the book of Mark, but also shared another source of material, primarily sayings of Jesus. This leads us to believe that there were copies of Q being circulated among early Christians. To date, no manuscripts of Q have been found. However, a group of scholars have dug through many layers of New Testament writings and have compiled what they be- lieve is the original written sayings of Jesus that circulated be- tween Jesus’ crucifixion and the writing of Matthew’s gospel about 80 C.E. You may want to consult the new book “The Lost Gospel of Q,” Dr. Marcus Borg, Consulting Editor, Mark Powelson and Ray Riegert are the editors. It is published by Ulysses Press, Berkeley, CA. This Sayings of Jesus booklet has put together “the source” in one easy-to-read format using the New Revised Standard Version text and other translations including my own. It reads quite quickly, and it presents a new light on the early Christian understanding of who they understood Jesus to be.

John said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” The people asked him, “What are we to do, then?” John answered, “Whoever has two shirts must give one to the man who has none, and whoever has food must share it.” (Mt 3:5-10; Lk 3:7-11) Q3 Even tax collectors came to John to be baptized, and they asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?” He said to them, “Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you.” Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what should we do?” He said to them, “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.” Lk 3:12-14 Q4 John the Baptist said, “I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” Mt 3:11-12; Lk 3:16-17"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Q5 Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, the sky opened up. The Spirit of God descended like a dove and alighted on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” Mt 3:13, 16-17; Lk 3:21b-22 Q6 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished. The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” But he answered, “One cannot live by bread alone.” Mt 4:1-4; Lk 4:1-4 Q7 Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’” Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Do not put God to the test.’” Mt 4:5-7; Lk 4:9-12 Q8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “It is written, ‘You must worship God, and serve only him.’” Then the devil left him to return at a later time. (Mt 4:8-11; Lk 5-8, 13) Q9 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying: “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and the servant does it.” When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith.

For I tell you, none of those who were invited will share my dinner.’” (Mt 22:1-10; Lk 14:16-24)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Q69 “If you love your father or mother, son or daughter more than me, you cannot follow me.

If a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hill- side and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.” (Mt 18:12-13; Lk 15:4-7) Q72 “Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’” (Lk 15:8-10) Q73 “No one can serve two masters; you will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other.

Occasions for stumbling are bound to come, but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes!” (Mt 18:6-7; Lk 17:1-2) Q77 “If a person does something against you, go to the person and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If your friend listens to you and says ‘I’m sorry,’ forgive and your bond will be strength- ened.” One of his disciples said to him, “How often should I forgive the same person? As many as seven times?” Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.” (Mt 18:15, 21-22; Lk 17:3-4) Q78 “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.” (Mt 17:20; Lk 17:6) Q79 Once Jesus was asked when the kingdom of God was coming, and he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ For, in fact, the kingdom of God is among you.” (Lk 17:20-21) Q80 Then he said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.

For as in those days before the flood they were eat- ing and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.

He summoned ten of his servants, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, ‘Do business with these until I come back.’ But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to rule over us.’ When he returned, having received royal power, he ordered these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading. The first came forward and said, ‘Lord, your pound has made ten more pounds.’ He said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.’ Then the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made five pounds.’ He said to him, ‘And you, rule over five cities.’ Then the other came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth, for I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not de- posit, and reap what you did not sow.’ He said to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I was a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned, I could have collected it with interest.’ He said to the bystanders, ‘Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.’ And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten pounds!’ ‘I tell you, to all those who have, more will be given; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.’” (Mt 25:14- 30; Lk 19:12-23) Q82 Jesus said to them, “You are those who have stood by me in my trials. You will eat and drink with me in the realm of God.” (Mt 19:28; Lk 22:28-30)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Some Notes ... Most of the verses I have taken from the Gospel of Matthew, how- ever in many cases Luke seems to capture the earlier version. In many instances, I have chosen words to translate the Greek that are more understandable in our culture. For instance, I have used the word “servant” rather than “slave” because in our society “slave” has a negative connotation. “Kingdom” may be interpreted today as a physi- cal place in which a king rules rather than a “realm” which I use to indicate a “culture” or a kind of “society.” The original Greek language has no punctuation. As we translate this into English, we add punctuation marks in order to clarify the meaning. Any translation will show the translator’s frame of refer- ence or theological approach by the words he/she chooses to convey the meaning of the author of the original Greek document. I hope you will read more than one translation in order to understand better the message from those in the first century. D. L. Michel February 3, 2005"}]
