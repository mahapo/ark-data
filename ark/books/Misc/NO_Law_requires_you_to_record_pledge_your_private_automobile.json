[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"NO Law requires you to record / pledge your private automobile As will be made painfully evident herewithin, a Private automobile is not required by any law , code or statute to be recorded . Any recording ( pledge ) of Private automobile to any agency is strictly voluntary . Any recordation / contract you or a Dealership has done was a fraudulently conveyed act as the recording agency/automobile Dealer told you that you must record your Private Property. The voluntary pledge that was done without just compensation is usually done through fraud, deceit, coercion and withholding of facts, which can only be construed as fraud and unjust enrichment by agency as well as a willful malicious act to unjustly enrich the recording agency and its public servants. If men , through fear, fraud or mistake , should in terms renounce or give up any natural right , the eternal law of reason and the gr and end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation. The right to freedom being the gift of Almighty God , it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave . Samuel Adams , our great president. “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;’ and to ‘secure,’ not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property which a man has honestly acquired he retains full control of , subject to these limitations: first, that he shall not use it to his neighbor’s injury , and that does not mean that he must use it for his neighbor’s bene fit: second, that if he devotes it to a public use, he gives to the public a right to control that use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it upon payment of due compensation .” Budd v. People of State of New York , 143 U.S. 517 (1892). There should be no arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty , or arbitrary spoilation of property . (Police power , Due Process ) Barber v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27, 31; Yick Yo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356. But whenever the operation and effect of any general regu lation is to extinguish or destroy that which by law of the land is the property of any person, so far as it has that effect, it is unconstitutional an d void. Thus, a law is considered as being a deprivation of property within the meaning of this constitutional guaranty if it deprives an owner of one of its essential attributes, destroys its value, restricts or inte rrupts its common, necessary, or profitable use, hampers the owner in the application of it to the purposes of trade, or imposes conditions upon the right to hold or use it and th ereby seriously impairs its value.

For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious.
