The effectiveness of aromatherapy essential oils cannot be fully understood without some discussion of their frequency or vibration. Frequency is a measurable rate of electrical energy that is constant between any two points. Every living thing has an elec trical frequency. Robert O. Becker, M.D., documents the electrical frequency of the human body in his book, The Body Electric . A \"frequency generator\" was developed in the early 1020's by Royal Raymond Rife, M.D. He found that by using certain frequencies, he could destroy a cancer cell or virus. He found that these frequencies could prevent the development of disease, and others would destroy disease. Substances with higher frequency will destroy diseases of a lower frequency. Bjorn Nordenstrom, a radiolog ist from Stockholm, Sweden, who wrote the book Biologically Closed Circuits , discovered in the 1980's that by putting an electrode inside a tumor and running a milliamp D.C. (Direct Current) through the electrode, he could dissolve the cancer tumor and sto p its growth. He found electropositive and electronegative energy fields in the human body. Bruce Tainio of Tainio Technology in Cheney, Washington, developed new equipment to measure the biofrequency of humans and foods. He used this biofrequency monitor, called a BT3™ Frequency Monitor which has a highly sensitive sensor, to determine the relationship between frequency and disease while measuring their frequencies. \"As a Hertzian wave is generated and travels out from its source, the wave transfers energy to the objects that it passes through. The frequency monitor's sensor measures the nano voltage of the wave passing through an object. The frequency of an essential oil, like any other substance, can depend on many variables. How the plants were raised, how they were harvested, how the oil was processed, how it is stored, the age of the product. To determine an average frequency for any product, one should measure and composite fre quencies from several batches. Frequencies have harmonics which have significant meaning or application to mathematicians and scientists involved in the study of sacred geometry, and practitioners using color, sound, and aroma therapies.\" What is a Hertz ? All atoms in the universe have vibrational motion. Each periodic motion has a \"frequency\" (the number of oscillations per second), measured in Hertz: 1 Hertz = 1Hz = 1 oscillation per second 1 Kilo Hertz = 1KHz = 1000 oscillations per second 1 Mega Hert z = 1MHz = 1,000,000 oscillations per second 1 Giga Hertz = 1GHz = 1,000,000,000 oscillations per second 1 Tetra Hertz = 1 THz = 1,000,000,000,000 oscillations per second  A living, healthy cell oscillates at 27,000,000,000,000 Hz.  DNA, within the cell, re sonates at 8,540,000,000,000 Hz."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" The vibrational frequencies of atoms in non - living solids at normal temperatures are of the order of 1013 Hz.  Vibrational frequencies of blue light are of the order of 7.5X1014 Hz.  Red light has a vibrational frequency of 4 .6X1014 Hz. Measuring in megahertz, it was found that:  processed / canned food had a zero MHz frequency  fresh produce measured up to 15 MHz frequency  dry herbs from 12 - 22 MHz  fresh herbs from 20 - 27 MHz  Essential oils started at 52 MHz and went as high as 320 MHz, which is the frequency of rose oil Clinical research shows that essential oils have the highest frequency of any natural substance known to man, creating an environment in which disease, bacteria, virus, fungus, etc., cannot live. A healthy body typically has a frequency ranging from 62 to 78 MHz, while disease begins at 58 MHz. Truly, the chemistry and frequencies of essential oils have the ability to help man maintain an optimal health frequency. It is wonderful to discover that essential o il frequencies are several times greater than frequencies of herbs and foods. For years, research has been conducted on the use of electrical energy to reverse disease. Scientists in the field of natural healing have believed there has to be a more natural way to increase the body's electrical frequency. This led to the research and subsequent discovery of electrical frequencies in essential oils. Patients felt better emotionally when oils were diffused in their rooms. It seemed that, within seconds, these patients were more calm and less anxious with little exposure and inhalation. Certain oils acted within 1 - 3 minutes; others acted within seconds. It is fascinating to think that an oil applied to the bottom of the feet could travel to the head and take eff ect within one minute. The more results that that have been seen, the more research has been initiated. With their immune - stimulating properties, essential oils may dramatically enhance and support the building of the immune system, whether they are inhale d or rubbed on the body topically. — D. Gary Young Unhealthy Substances Cause Frequency Changes In one test, the frequency of two individuals – the first a 26 year old male and the second a 24 year old male – was measured at 66 MHz each. The first individu al held a cup of coffee (without drinking any), and his frequency dropped to 58 MHz in 3 seconds. He put the coffee down and inhaled an aroma of essential oils. Within 21 seconds, his frequency had returned to 66 MHz. The second individual took a sip of co ffee and his frequency dropped to 52 MHz in the same 3 seconds. However, no essential oils were used during the recovery time, and it took 3 days for his frequency to return to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"its initial 66 MHz. One surprising aspect of this study measured the influence that thoughts have on the body's electrical frequency. The Significance of Frequency When molecules of essential oils are inhaled, swallowed, applied to the skin, or internalized into your body in any way, they resonate with your bodily tissues at the freq uencies intrinsic to their molecular spectrum as well as their resultant harmonic and beat frequencies. This increases your own natural electromagnetic vibrations and restores coherence to your electric fields to produce healing and maintain wellness. Freq uency resonance is only one of more than six processes by which therapeutic grade essential oils can heal and benefit your health. Each oil has a frequency and each of our organs and body parts have a frequency. Bone frequency is 39 - 43; neck and down frequ ency is 62 - 68. The frequency of an oil will attract a like frequency in the body. Lower frequencies become a sponge for negative energy. The frequency is what stays in the body to maintain the longer lasting effects of the oil.  LOW frequencies make PHYSICA L changes in the body.  MIDDLE frequencies make EMOTIONAL changes in the body.  HIGH frequencies make SPIRITUAL changes in the body. Spiritual frequencies range from 92 - 360 MHz. Oils Respond to Words, Thoughts and Prayer We respond to the thoughts and prayers of others, whether we are aware of it or not, and so do essential oils. In some of Bruce Tainio’s work, essential oils were measured before and after being bombarded with negative thoughts. Their frequencies went down by 12 MHz. When positive thoughts were aimed at the oils, their frequencies went up by 10 MHz. When the oils were prayed over, their resonant frequencies went up by 15 MHz. Oils amplify intent. And intent will move molecules of oil to where they can best serve to heal. This is why prayer and anointing with essential oils work so well when combined together.

Essential oils will penetrate into the body when applied to the skin. P laced on the foot they will be distributed to every cell in the body in 21 minutes. They will even penetrate a finger or toe nail to treat fungus underneath. Essential oils stay in the body about 20 minutes to 2 hours and leave no residuals. The effects an d frequency are accumulative when the mental attitude changes. We must have a desire to change and work on it or the old programming will keep coming back. Oils are a precursor to set up stage for action and a catalyst to do the work (the blood stream). Oi ls go where the need is present and are activated in that area. Testing on the thyroid, heart and pancreas showed that the oils reached these organs in 3 seconds! When layered, one oil applied over another, it is faster. The body absorbs the oils fastest b y inhalation and second fastest by applying to the feet or ears. The oils also cross the blood brain barrier; they piggy - back the energy waves to get into the cells."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"All the essential oils deliver cell wall penetrating oxygen, and it is the unhealthy cells that need the oxygen for the road back to health. When the cell wall thickens, oxygen can’t get in – life expectancy of a cell is 120 days to 4 months). Cells divide making 2 duplicate cells, and if it is diseased, it will make 2 new diseased cells. When we stop the mutation of the cells and create healthy cells, we stop the disease. Therapeutic grade essential oils can restore cells to normal in 7 seconds. Do not wait until you have the “right” essential oil before administering to a symptom. You cannot b e doing it wrong if you use any of the oils for any symptom! When an oil causes discomfort, it is because it is pulling toxins, chemical, heavy metals, poisons, parasites and mucus from the system. Either stop taking the oils for a short time to make sure your body isn’t eliminating too fast or dilute the oils with V - 6 Mixing Oil until the body catches up with the releasing. These toxins go back into the system if they cannot be released. If a person does not like the smell of an oil, it is usually because of an acidic condition or the aroma is triggering an emotional/spiritual memory to be cleared. T H E P O W E R O F S C E N T B Y G A R Y Y O U N G Essential oils have electromagnetic energy. Electromagnetic energy has an entire color spectrum. Electromagnetic energy and all energy forms are measured in wavelengths, and each color of that spectrum has a specific wavelength. Each essential oil based on the molecules within it contain a spectrum of mixed wavelengths. Why? Because one molecule like thymol will have one color, ca rvacrol will have another color. Borneol, linalool, lavendulol, esters, and aldehydes will all have their own individual colors and wavelengths. This is so that as it is introduced to the human body, it corresponds to the wavelengths of the receptors. The human body senses and understands the language and quality of this energy interaction, so we see the wavelengths portrayed in colors as they are being measured, which are created simply from the energy of language. We've heard about the power of the spok en word. In 1960, Richard Feinman taught about energy and its ability to produce a spiritual effect. Traditional energy manifests in the form of heat, motion, vitality, thoughts, feelings and emotions. It's interesting that we have thoughts before feelings and emotions, isn't it? How powerful are your thoughts? We think a thought, we feel a feeling, we smell a substance, we have a bodily reaction, physical or emotional. How many of you have smelled something, and it started you thinking? How many of you h ave walked through a bakery or the mall, smelled Cinnabons baking, and have thought of Grandma on the farm or Mom baking bread when you came home from school, which you could smell as you walked across the yard to the house?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" How many of you who grew up on a farm love the smell of the freshly mown lawn in the evening, and it takes you back to cutting or pitching hay and bucking bales? Isn't everything connected? Human Electrical Frequencies and Fields \"Frequency is defined as a measurable rate of electrical energy flow that is constant between any two points. Everything has an electrical frequency, and what an incredible discovery it was for me to learn that essential oils contain frequencies that are s everal times greater than the frequencies of herbs and foods. Robert 0. Becker, M.D. , the author of the book, The Body Electric validates the electrical frequency of the human body. Royal Raymond Rife, M.D. , developed a \"frequency generator\" in the early 1920s. With this he found that with certain frequencies he could destroy a cancer cell or a virus. He found that certain frequencies could prevent the development of disease, and othe rs would destroy disease. Nikola Tesla said that if you could eliminate certain outside frequencies that interfered in our bodies, we would have greater resistance toward disease. Bjorn Nordenstrom , a radiologist of Stockholm, Sweden, who wrote \"Biologica lly Closed Circuits,\" discovered in the early 1980s that by putting an electrode inside a tumor and running a milliamp D.C. current through the electrode, he could dissolve the cancer tumor and stop its growth. He found that the human body had electroposit ive and electronegative energy fields. For a number of years during my clinical practice, I researched the use of electrical energy for the purpose of reversing the disease process. I kept feeling that there had to be a more natural way of increasing a per son's electrical frequency, which led to the discovery of the electrical frequency of oils. One of the things that I noticed with my patients was that they felt better emotionally when they first started to use essential oils. It seemed that, within second s, congestion would begin to loosen just through simple inhalation of an oil. Certain oils applied on location would decrease pain 50 - 80 percent within 1 - 3 minutes. Some even experienced a decrease in pain within seconds. I could not have thought that an o il applied to the bottom of the feet could travel to the neck and reduce pain by 70 percent within one minute. As I saw this happen over and over, I started to realize that there had to be other aspects and elements in the oils that had to be researched. M easuring in hertz, we found that processed/canned food had a zero Hz frequency, fresh produce had up to 15 Hz, dry herbs from 12 - 22 Hz, and fresh herbs from 20 - 27 Hz. Essential oils started at 52 Hz and went as high as 320 Hz, which is the frequency of ros e oil. A healthy body, from head to foot, typically has a frequency ranging from 62 to 78 Hz, while disease begins at 58 Hz. Clinical research shows that essential oils have the highest frequency of any natural substance known to man, creating an environme nt in which disease, bacteria, virus,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"fungus, etc., cannot live . I believe that the chemistry and frequencies of essential oils have the ability to help man maintain the optimal frequency to the extent that disease cannot exist. Once in a while, individuals using an essential oil for the first time will say they broke out with a rash or had an allergic reaction. So many reactions are the body's chemical sensitivity kicking in and saying, \"protect me.\" However, when I worked with people with severe allergies, even universal reactors, once they understood that pure essential oils actually detoxify and help re - establish cellular balance, would calm down and realize they were not having a reaction. It's amazing to see how we in America have become sens itive to things around us, and yet at the same time we are desensitized to the things that are killing us, causing allergies, depressing the immune system, creating a weakness for diseases, such as candida, epstein bar, chronic fatigue syndrome, hypoglycem ia, universal reactor symptoms, and other chemical sensitive problems. It just goes from level one to level six, manifesting different symptoms. Because the sense of smell is so incredible, it is important to understand why we have these sensitivities and reactions. Let's go back to the early days of steam distillation, which is one of the most common ways of extracting oils from plants, trees, shrubs, flowers and herbs. This is done by sending steam into a chamber that holds the raw product. As the steam r ises, it stimulates the oil membranes in the plant, causing them to open, thereby releasing the oil molecule that has a micro - fine membrane around it, which is there to protect the oil. If the membrane is fractured while the oil is being released, the oil is damaged, and the molecular structure of the oil is altered. in nature, as the evening cools, the oil comes closer to the surface. As the day begins, the sun's warmth causes this membrane to relax, open and release the oil into the atmosphere. Vertical s team distillation gives us the greatest potential for protecting the oil and maintaining its integrity in order to protect its therapeutic benefits for fragrance and balancing the body. All of this must work on the areas in the brain that are connected to the limbic system, which affects emotional trauma release, appeases anxiety and helps overcome depression. In ancient distillation, low pressure (5 pounds and under) and low temperature were extremely important in order to have the therapeutic benefits of this gentle process. Marcel Espieu, who has been the President of the Lavender Growers Association for 21 years in southern France, told me, when I was studying with him, that the best quality of oil would be produced when the pressure was zero pounds duri ng distillation . Temperature also has a very distinct effect on the oils. At certain temperatures, the oil fragrance, as well as the chemical constituents, can be changed. High pressures and high temperatures seem to cause a harshness in the oil where even the oil pH and the electropositive and electronegative balance are greatly affected. For example, Cypress requires 24 hours at a maximum of 245 degrees at 5 pounds of pressure in order for all of the active constituents and properties to be released. But if it is distilled less than 22 hours, 18 - 20 of the primary constituents will be missing, which are absolutely essential to the therapeutic application of the oil and the expected response. However, most of the distilling operations throughout the world di still cypress for only one hour and 15 minutes. Lavender is distilled in France with a steam temperature of up to 350 degrees and up to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"155 pounds of pressure for 15 minutes. Although the oil is easily sold and marketed, it is of very poor quality. The pro blem we have in America is that people are more concerned about price than quality. Naturally, you can sell lavender oil inexpensively if you can produce a pound of oil in 15 minutes versus a pound of oil in an hour and a half. To maintain the highest grad e of oil and to be able to get all the properties in the oil that create the therapeutic effect in the healing of burns, reducing of headaches and fevers and overcoming insomnia and PMS, that oil must be of the highest grade and quality. In the larger fiel ds of the world during the distillation time, one can see chemical trucks hooked into the distillers pumping solvents into the water already in the boiler. This increases the oil production by as much as 18 percent. However, when you put a chemical in the water and force this with steam into the plant, it causes a fracturing of the molecular stricture of the oil, altering its fragrance and constituents because you cannot separate the chemicals from the oil after it comes through the condenser. Most of the l avender oil sold in America today is lavendin, which is a hybrid and is grown and distilled in either China or Russia. The oil production in both locations tests high in radioactive isotopes. They bring it into France, cut it with synthetic linolol acetate to improve the fragrance, add propylene glycol or SD 40, which is a solvent that has no smell 'and increases the volume, and then sell it in the United States as lavender oil. We in America don't know the difference and are happy to buy and sell it for $5 - 7 per half ounce in health food stores, beauty salons, grocery and department stores and through mail order. Frankincense is another example of an adulterated oil. The frankincense resin, or gum, that is sold in Somalia costs between $30,000 and $35,000 p er ton and when steam distilled is very expensive. However, frankincense that is sold for as low as $25 per ounce is distilled with alcohol. When these cut, synthetic and adulterated oils cause rashes, burns or other irritations, we wonder why we don't get the benefit we were expecting and come to the conclusion that essential oils don't have that much value. There are first, second, third and fourth stages of distillation, with each one becoming weaker and weaker to which synthetic fragrance constituents a re added and then sold to the unsuspecting public. Many people have jumped on the bandwagon because of the money - making potential that they see with essential oils. They buy cheap oils, rebottle them, label them as 100 percent pure essential oils and marke t them without ever knowing their origin or who was responsible for the distillation. After seeing the number of farms going out of business in France and Germany, I was concerned that the day would come when we would have a difficult time obtaining oils. I felt I needed to find farm land where we could begin growing our own crops in order to secure our supply and quality. After many months of looking, I was led to the Benawah Valley near St. Maries, Idaho, where we now have 50 acres in production. We were very specific in choosing land that had never had chemicals on it because all our growing and production operations are strictly organic. Our farms in Utah, Idaho, and France are all organic. Young Living is now supervising the distillation of some of the oils that it sells as well as buying directly from the distilleries in order to avoid adulteration and inferior quality of oils that are produced around the world. We begin with the pure seeds and take them all the way through the growing, harvesting, dist illing, formulating, packaging and marketing. This way we know what we have and can stand behind the production and the quality."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"At the Young Living Research Farm in Idaho, I built four different distillers and, as I mentioned, the largest and only stainle ss steel vertical steam distiller in North America, so we could control our operation in order to produce the highest quality of oil possible. After building the first two, I invented a steam decompression chamber and manifold that delivers the steam at ze ro pounds of pressure to the chambers. In 1994, we produced an extremely high quality of peppermint and clary sage oils as well as the first distilled wild tansy oil in the world. When we attended the essential oil medical convention in September of 1994, everyone who sampled the oils was excited and wanted to know where they could purchase some. They were fascinated with the wild tansy as that was a new and almost exotic smell for them. We have acquired more farm land in Utah and will be building an entire distillery there so that the new crops can be distilled on site. Our projection for the spring of 1996 is to plant 1,500 acres in crop between Utah and Idaho.\" Copyright 1996 - 99 D. Gary Young "}]
