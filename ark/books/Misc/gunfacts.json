Fact: Most gun-related crime is caused by gang activity. 2 These organized bands of criminals commit many crimes, and guns are tools they use. Control gangs and you will control gun violence (consider that more than 28% of kids in high school report street gang presence at their schools 3 ).   1 Prof. Gary Kleck, “Targeting Guns: Firearms and their control”, w/ supporting data from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics, 1972 to 1995 2 FBI, Uniform Crime Statistics, 1976-98 3 Kathryn A.

SCS, see Appendix 8."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Gun Facts Version 3.0 Page 2 Copyright 2001, Guy Smith All Rights Reserved Fact: Five out of six gun-possessing felons obtained handguns from the secondary market and by theft, and \"criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.” 4 Fact: The majority of handguns possessed by criminals are stolen, although not necessarily by the criminal in question. 5 Fact: Per capita firearm ownership rates have remained relatively unchanged since 1959 while crime rates have gone up and down depending on economics, drug trafficking innovations, and “get tough” legislation. 6 Thoughts: Criminals are not motivated by guns. They are motivated by opportunity. Attempts to reduce public access to firearms provide criminals more points of opportunity. It is little wonder that high-crime cities also tend to be those with the most restrictive gun control laws – which criminals tend to ignore.

But these areas are almost devoid of schoolyard shootings. Clearly, availability is not the issue.

Kellerman, Protection or Peril?: An Analysis of Firearm-Related Deaths in the Home, 314 New Eng. J. Med. 1557-60 1986. Kellerman admits that his study did \"not include cases in which burglars or intruders are wounded or frightened away by the use or display of a firearm.\" He also admitted his study did not look at situations in which intruders \"purposely avoided a home known to be armed.\" This is a classic case of a “study” conducted to achieve a desired result. In his critique of this “study”, Gary Kleck notes that the estimation of gun ownership rates were “inaccurate” , and that the total population came from a non-random selection of only two cities."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Gun Facts Version 3.0 Page 3 Copyright 2001, Guy Smith All Rights Reserved Gun Retail vs Gun Violence 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Alaska North Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Maine Oklahoma New Hampshire Colorado Utah Tennessee Alabama Virginia Ohio Florida Delaware New York California Gun Retailers per 100,000 Population - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 % Homicides by Firearms Retailers Handgun Firearm Fact: Of the remaining deaths, the deceased family members include felons, drug dealers, violent spouses committing assault, and other criminal activities. 10 Fact: Only 0.1% (1 in a thousand) of the defensive uses of guns results in the death of the predator. 11 This means you are infinitely more likely to prevent a crime without bloodshed than hurt a family member.

Persons with household incomes of less than $35,000 per year live with significantly higher violent crime rates when compared with those who had household incomes of $35,000 or more per year. 18 Thus, the higher incident of gun violence is a reflection of the overall higher violent crime rate in poor communities, not the presence of guns .

Since most violent crime is committed by males ages 16-24, these numbers include adult gang members dying during criminal activity 19 (incidentally, ‘ child ’ is defined by Webster as a person between birth and puberty, typically 13-14 years). Fact: Criminals are included - 70% of these deaths are adults, age 17-20, involved in gang warfare . Half of the juveniles killed are involved in gang activity at the time of their deaths, often involved in drug related firefights. Fact: Suicides and criminals included - These numbers include criminal activities and suicides. 20 As suicides make up more than ½ of all gun deaths, the number drops even further, to less than one per day. When you do all the subtraction, the result is less than one child per day Fact: Over 13 teenagers die every day at the wheel of their automobiles. 21 Fact: Four children die each day in the U.S. from parental neglect and abuse. 22 Thought: Perhaps we should register and license parents Fact: For contrast, consider this: 1,680 children die each day from malaria 23 and that 15 men, women and children per day are murdered by a convicted felon in a supposedly government supervised parole/probation program. 24 M M M y y y t t t h h h : : : S S S t t t r r r i i i c c c t t t e e e r r r g g g u u u n n n c c c o o o n n n t t t r r r o o o l l l l l l a a a w w w s s s c c c o o o u u u l l l d d d h h h a a a v v v e e e p p p r r r e e e v v v e e e n n n t t t e e e d d d t t t h h h e e e C C C o o o l l l u u u m m m b b b i i i n n n e e e m m m a a a s s s s s s a a a c c c r r r e e e Fact: Harris and Klebold violated close to 20 firearms laws in obtaining weapons.

In states that allow citizens to carry guns, there has been only one. 25 Fact: The five school shootings which occurred during the '97-98 school year took place after the 1995 Gun-Free School Zones law was enacted, banning guns (including lawfully possessed concealed handguns) within 1,000 feet of a school. 26 Fact: In the school shooting in Pearl, Mississippi, the assistant principal had formerly carried a firearm to school. When the 1995 \"Gun-Free School Zones\" law passed, he began locking his firearm in his car and parking it at least a quarter-mile away from the school. When that shooting incident started he ran to his car, unlocked it, got his gun, ran back, disarmed the shooter and held him on the ground for five minutes until the police arrived. Had the law not been passed, the assistant principal might have prevented the two deaths and seven shooting related injuries.

Fact: Worldwide, the per capita suicide rate is fairly static (in fact, the suicide rate of the U.S. is lower than many industrial countries, including many that have banned private gun ownership). This indicates a certain fraction of the population will commit suicide regardless of the tools available. Will we ban razor blades and bridges?

Fact: Most Americans (if they are firearm owners or not) believe that it is the way parents raise their kids that cause gun violence. Among non-firearm owners, 38% said it was parental neglect that causes youth violence, while only 28% thought it was due to the availability of guns. 31 They may be right as most homicides of kids under age five are by their own parents.

In fact, they have been falling though most of the 1990s: 34 Fact: 85% percent of all the communities in America recorded no juvenile homicides in 1995, and 93.4% recorded one or no juvenile arrests for murder. 35 Fact: Only 10% of public schools reported one or more serious violent crimes during the 1996- 97 school year. 36 Fact: In 1996, even though there were around 80 million people owning guns, there were only 44 accidental gun deaths for children under age 10, or about 0.0001%. 37 Fact: California has a trigger lock law and saw a 12% increase in fatal firearm accidents in 1994. Texas doesn't have one and experienced a 28% decrease in the same year. 38 \"Trigger-locks\" do, however, render guns inaccessible for self-defense. Fact: Children as young as seven (7) years old have demonstrated that they can pick or break trigger locks, or operate a gun with a trigger lock in place. 39 Over half of non-criminal firearm deaths for children over age seven are suicides, so trigger locks are unlikely to reduce these deaths.   33 Washington Post, Feb 7, 2001, Page A01 34 National Center for Education Statistics' Violence and Discipline Problems in U.S. Public Schools, 1996-97 35 Federal Bureau of Investigation “Crime in the United States: Uniform Crime Reports”, 1996 36 Department of Education \"Principal./ School Disciplinarian Survey on School Violence\", March, 2000 37 Prof. John Lott, CBS News web site, March 20, 2000 38 National Center for Health Statistics, 1995 39 General Accounting Office, “Accidental Shootings: many deaths and injuries caused by firearms could be prevented,” United States General Accounting Office, March 1991."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Gun Facts Version 3.0 Page 9 Copyright 2001, Guy Smith All Rights Reserved Fact: If criminals are deterred from attacking victims because of the fear that people might be able to defend themselves, gunlocks may in turn reduce the cost of criminals committing crime, and thus increase crime.

They repealed their gun registration law in the 1980s after police acknowledged its worthlessness. Fact: Not in Australia . “It seems just to be an elaborate system of arithmetic with no tangible aim. Probably, and with the best of intentions, it may have been thought, that if it were known what firearms each individual in Victoria owned, some form of control may be exercised, and those who were guilty of criminal misuse could be readily identified. This is a fallacy, and has been proven not to be the case” 50 Fact: Not in Canada . More than 20,000 Canadian gun-owners have publicly refused to register their firearms. Many others are silently ignoring the law. The provincial governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have dumped both the administration and the enforcement of all federal gun-control laws right back into Ottawa's lap, throwing the Canadian government into civil war, one fought on paper for the time being. And all at a cost over three 51 to ten 52 times the original projected cost. Rank and file police officers in Calgary and Edmonton have withdrawn their backing of Ottawa's gun control registry and Alberta is ready to follow suit. \"The gun registry as it sits right now is causing law abiding citizens to register their guns but it does nothing to take one illegal gun off the street or to increase any type of penalty for anybody that violates any part of the legislation,\" according to Al Koenig, President, Calgary Police Association. 53 Fact: Not in Germany . The Federal Republic of Germany began comprehensive gun registration in 1972. The government estimated between 17,000,000 and 20,000,000 million guns were to be registered, and in fact only 3,200,000 million surfaced, leaving some 80% unaccounted for. 54   49 Steven W.

The 1928 Law on Firearms and Ammunition (before the Nazis came to power) required all firearms to be registered. When Hitler came to power, the existing lists were used for confiscating weapons. Fact: It did in Australia. In 1996, the Australian government confiscated over 660,000 legal weapons from their citizens. Fact: It did in California. The 1989 Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act required registration. Due to changing definitions of “assault weapons”, many legal firearms are now being confiscated by the California government. Fact: It did in New York City. In 1967, New York City passed an ordinance requiring a citizen to obtain a permit to own a rifle or shotgun, which would then be registered. In 1991, the city passed a ban on the private possession of some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and ‘registered’ owners were told that those firearms had to be surrendered, rendered inoperable, or taken out of the city.

Fact: As long as the unlicensed purchaser is never caught with the handgun, the unlawful sale will go unnoticed. The risk of detection is negligible. If the unlicensed handgun owner is arrested, he could claim that he did not need a license because he had owned this handgun before licensing went into effect. 59 Fact: Currently, federal prosecutors do not eagerly accept for prosecution felon-in-possession cases unless the felon is a hardened criminal who represents a threat to the public. 60 Fact: According to the Supreme Court, criminals do not have to obtain licenses or register their weapons, as that would be an act of self-incrimination. 61 Fact: Prohibition (which started as a ‘moderation’ movement) didn’t keep people from drinking.

In the firearm lexicon, there is no such thing as an “assault weapon”. The closest relative is the “assault rifle”, which is basically a machine gun that fires rifle cartridges. The authoritative source is the Department of Defense Small Arms Identification and Operations Guide: Assault rifle is defined as 'short, compact, select-fire weapons that fires a cartridge intermediate in power between submachine gun and rifle cartridges\" – i.e. a machine gun. Firearms often referred to as “assault weapons” have no greater firepower than a hunting rifles or handguns. They are styled to look like military weapons, but have no greater killing capacity than other civilian weapons. For a well-documented overview of how “assault weapons” are protected by the Second Amendment, as well as a discourse on why gun registration is barred by the constitution, see Brian Puckett’s article \"Why I WILL NOT Obey California's Gun Registration Edict\" at http://www.guntruths.com/ M M M y y y t t t h h h : : : “ “ “ A A A s s s s s s a a a u u u l l l t t t w w w e e e a a a p p p o o o n n n s s s ” ” ” a a a r r r e e e a a a s s s e e e r r r i i i o o o u u u s s s p p p r r r o o o b b b l l l e e e m m m i i i n n n t t t h h h e e e U U U . . .

Fact: “Assault weapons” were used in less than 2% of crimes involving firearms and 0.25% of all violent crime 63 before the enactment of any national or state “assault weapons” ban. Fact: Even weapons misclassified as “assault weapons” (common in the Federal and California assault weapons confiscations) are used in less than 1% of all homicides. 64 Fact: Police reports show that “assault weapons” are a non-problem: For California: • Los Angeles: In 1998, of 538 documented gun incidents, only one (0.2%) involved an \"assault weapon\". • San Francisco: In 1998, only 2.2% of confiscated weapons were \"assault weapons\". • San Diego: Between 1988 and 1990, only 0.3% of confiscated weapons were \"assault weapons\". For the rest of the nation: • Between 1980 and 1994, only 2% of confiscated guns were \"assault weapons\". • Just over 2% of criminals that used guns used “assault weapons”. • Only 1% of police officers murdered were killed using “assault weapons”. Fact: Only 1.4% of weapons recovered are of the models covered under Clinton’s 1994 assault weapons ban were used in crimes. 65   62 FBI Uniform Crime Statistics, 1994 63 Gary Kleck, “Targeting Guns”, 1997, compilation of 48 metropolitan police departments from 1980-1994 64 FBI Uniform Crime Statistics, 1993"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Gun Facts Version 3.0 Page 15 Copyright 2001, Guy Smith All Rights Reserved Fact: In Virginia, none of the inmates surveyed had carried an assault weapon during the commission of their last crime, despite 20% admitting that they had previously owned such weapons. 66 Fact: Most “assault weapons” have no more firepower or killing capacity than the average hunting rifle and “play a small role in overall violent crime”. 67 M M M y y y t t t h h h : : : A A A s s s s s s a a a u u u l l l t t t w w w e e e a a a p p p o o o n n n s s s a a a r r r e e e u u u s s s e e e d d d i i i n n n 1 1 1 6 6 6 % % % o o o f f f h h h o o o m m m i i i c c c i i i d d d e e e s s s Fact: This figure was derived in New York during promotion of an “assault weapons” bill. The classification scheme used encompassed most firearms sold in the U.S. since 1987 (center fire rifles and shotguns holding more than six cartridges, and handguns holding more than 10 rounds).

Even those misclassified handguns tend to be bigger that concealed carry will allow. Criminals (who incidentally disregard concealed carry laws) are unlikely to carry assault weapons. They are simply impractical for committing crime. Thoughts: Recall the Rodney King riots in that anti-gun city of Los Angeles.

Since then, the city's murder rate has risen 134 percent while the national murder rate has dropped 2 percent. 80 Fact: Among the 15 states with the highest homicide rates, 10 have restrictive or very restrictive gun laws. 81 Fact: 20% of U.S. homicides occur in four cities with just six percent of the population -- New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. -- and each has a virtual prohibition on private handguns. 82 Fact: New York has one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation -- and 20% of the armed robberies. 83 Fact: There are more than 22,000 84 gun laws at the city, county, state, and federal level.

You can buy as many as you want and drive them all you like on your own property without a license. Fact: Cars are registered because they are (a) a source of tax revenue, (b) the object of fraud in some transactions, and (c) a high theft object. Thus we ask the government to track these. Fact: There is no constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear automobiles, and thus they are subject to greater regulation than guns. Fact: There are more guns in the U.S. than cars (228,000,000 guns according to 1998 FBI stats, and 207,754,000 automobiles according to 1998 Federal Highway Administration registrations). Yet you are 31 times more likely to be accidentally killed by a car than a gun according to the National Safety Council 85 . . . despite cars having been registered and licensed for almost 100 years.

The Brady law did not apply to 18 states, but after 1994 their violent crime fell as quickly as other states. 88 Fact: Most Americans agree that the bill is worthless. 51 % believe the act has been ineffective at reducing violent crime, and 56% believe it has had no impact on reducing the number of homicides in the U.S. 89 M M M y y y t t t h h h : : : G G G u u u n n n l l l a a a w w w s s s a a a r r r e e e b b b e e e i i i n n n g g g e e e n n n f f f o o o r r r c c c e e e d d d Fact: During the Clinton administration, federal prosecutions of gun-related crimes dropped more than 44 percent. 90   85 207,754,000 automobiles according to Federal Highway Administration, October 1998. 240,000,000 guns according to 1996 FBI Uniform Crime Statistics 86 FBI Uniform Crime Reports for 1992 and 1997 87 Dr. Jens Ludwig , Dr. Philip J.

This includes 71% of the violations coming from convicted or indicted felons. 92 None of these were prosecuted by the Federal government in 1996, 1997, or 1998. 93 Fact: Some of the reasons listed for not prosecuting known gun criminals include “minimal federal interest” and “DOJ/U.S. Attorney policy”. 94 Fact: 1/2 of the referrals of violent criminals were closed without investigation or prosecution. 95 Fact: The average sentence for a federal firearms violation dropped from 57 months to 46 months from 1996 to 1998. 96 Fact: In 1998, the government prosecuted just eight children for gun law violations. 97 In that same year, there were: • 8 prosecutions for juvenile handgun possession. • 6 prosecutions for handgun transfer to juveniles. • 1 prosecution for Brady Law violations.

The net savings, under a worst-case scenario, is about $3.5 billion a year. 101 Fact: Guns are used 65 times more often to prevent a crime than to commit one. 102 Fact: The medical cost of gun violence is only 0.16% of America’s annual health care expenditures. 103 Fact: Drunken drivers killed 15,935 in 1998 104 while homicides with guns were 12,102 for the same year.

The BATF once prosecuted gun collectors who sold as few as three guns per year at gun shows, claiming that they were unlicensed, and therefore illegal, gun dealers. To avoid such harassment, thousands of American gun collectors became licensed gun dealers. Now the BATF claims not to have the resources to audit the paperwork monster it created.

Fact: In Merced California, an intruder stabbed three children to death with a pitchfork.

Consider this: Crime Rate Gun Availability High Low High United States Switzerland Low Mexico Japan Or, to use detailed data, we can contrast the per capita homicide rate with the per capita gun ownership rate between different industrialized countries. Doing so shows zero correlation between the availability of guns and the overall homicide rate. Fact: Switzerland has extremely lenient gun control (more so than the U.S.) 168 , and has the third- lowest homicide rate of the top nine major European countries, and the same per capita rate as England and Wales. 169   168 In Switzerland, handguns are obtainable once a person obtains a simple police permit that is valid for three months. During that time the permit holder may buy as many handguns as he wishes, and purchases are generally not registered. For 43% of the population, there are no rules requiring a person carrying a loaded handgun to obtain any permission at all. 169 Carol Kalish, International Crime Rates, Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report (Washington: Department of Justice, May 1988). 1984 data for Switzerland, and the 1983 data for England and Wales.

Fact: Comparing crime rates between America and Britain is flawed. In America, a gun crime is recorded as a gun crime. In Britain, a crime is only recorded when there is a final disposition (a conviction). All unsolved gun crimes in Britain are not reported as gun crimes, grossly undercounting the amount of gun crime there. 170 To make matters worse, British law enforcement has been exposed for falsifying criminal reports to create falsely lower crime figures, in part to preserve tourism. 171   170 Gallant , Hills, Kopel, “Fear in Britain”, Independence Institute, July 18, 2000 171 Daily Telegraph, 1996 Contact Crime Victimization Rates 0.4 1.4 1.5 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.4 3.4 3.6 4.1 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 Japan Portugal Spain Belgium USA Net her lands Sw itzerland Sw eden Fr anc e Denmark Northern Ireland Po l a n d Finland Canada Scotland Engalnd and Wales A ustrilia % Victimized in 1999"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Gun Facts Version 3.0 Page 36 Copyright 2001, Guy Smith All Rights Reserved Fact: A continuing parliamentary inquiry into the growing number of black market weapons has concluded that there are more than three million illegally held firearms in circulation - double the number believed to have been held 10 years ago - and that criminals are more willing than ever to use them. One in three criminals under the age of 25 owns or has access to a firearm. 172 Fact: Between 1997 and 1999, there were 429 murders in the capital, the highest two-year figure for more than 10 years – nearly two-thirds of those involved firearms – in a country that has banned private firearm ownership. 173 Fact: Over the last century, the British crime rate was largely unchanged. In the late nineteenth century, the per capita homicide rate in Britain was between 1.0 and 1.5 per 100,000. 174 In the late twentieth century, after a near ban on gun ownership, the homicide rate is around 1.1. 175 This shows that the homicide rate does not vary with either the level of gun control or gun availability. Fact: The U.K. has strict gun control and a rising homicide rate of 1.4 per capita. Switzerland that has the highest per capita firearm ownership rate on the planet (all males age 20 to 42 are required to keep rifles or pistols at home) has a homicide rate of 1.2 per capita.

Japan’s murder rate may be low, but its suicide rate is over 20 per 100,000 people. Japanese are being murdered and committing suicide at a rate of about 21 per 100,000.

App. 1981), the court stated: `[C]ourts have without exception concluded that when a municipality or other governmental entity undertakes to furnish police services, it assumes a duty only to the public at large and not to individual members of the community.' Fact: There are not enough police to protect everyone. Currently, there are about 150,000 police officers on duty at any one time. 184 • This is on-duty police. This includes desk clerks, command sergeants, etc. – far fewer than 150,000 cops are cruising your neighborhood. • There are approximately 271,933,702 people living in the United States. 185 • Thus there is only one on-duty cop for every 1,813 citizens!

Indeed, the number of shots from revolvers (all within 6-8 round capacity) and semi-automatics were about the same – 2.04 vs. 2.53. 193 In a crime or gun battle, there is seldom time or need to shoot more.

It depended on whether a gun had military (militia) use, and they wanted some evidence presented, confirming that citizens have a right to military style weapons . Since no evidence was taken at the trial level in lower courts, they remanded the case for a new trial. Specifically the court said: \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense . \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time .\" Fact: Even the US government agreed. Here are some sentences from the brief filed by the government in the appeal to the Supreme Court: “The Second Amendment does not grant to the people the right to keep and bear arms, but merely recognizes the prior existence of that right and prohibits its infringement by Congress.” “The \"arms\" referred to in the Second Amendment are, moreover, those which ordinarily are used for military or public defense purposes . . .” “The Second Amendment does not confer upon the people the right to keep and bear arms; it is one of the provisions of the Constitution which, recognizing the prior existence of a certain right, declares that it shall not be infringed by Congress. Thus the right to keep and bear arms is not a right granted by the Constitution and therefore is not dependant upon that instrument for its source.” S S S u u u m m m m m m a a a r r r y y y o o o f f f v v v a a a r r r i i i o o o u u u s s s c c c o o o u u u r r r t t t d d d e e e c c c i i i s s s i i i o o o n n n s s s c c c o o o n n n c c c e e e r r r n n n i i i n n n g g g g g g u u u n n n r r r i i i g g g h h h t t t s s s D ECISIONS THAT EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE S ECOND A MENDMENT GUARANTEES AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO PURCHASE , POSSESS OR CARRY FIREARMS , AND IT LIMITS THE AUTHORITY OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS : • U.S. vs. Emerson, 1999, Nunn v.

Other estimates indicate that 41% of U.S. households are gun-owning households.

Professional survey designers have criticized both Harris and Gallup gun surveys for their construction – that the surveys have been designed to reach a desired conclusion. 208 Fact: Americans believe parents and popular culture are more responsible for violence in America than firearms. 209 Fact: A recent and well-constructed survey by Time Magazine showed some interesting results. From 33,202 adult Americans surveyed in 1998: Yes No  Should the U.S. have stricter gun control laws? 6.73% 92.25% Do you believe that allowing people to carry concealed weapons reduce crime? 92.22% 7.76% Do you believe that U.S. cities should sue gun manufacturers to recoup money spent dealing with gun- related crime? 1.96% 98.01%   206 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 1997 207 Gallup/Women.com poll, May 2000 208 Often these surveys use questions like \"If it reduced crime, would you favor stronger gun control laws\". These questions are rephrased in headline to read \"Americans demand gun control\" while ignoring the leading goal of reducing crime. These surveys also fail to ask counter balancing questions to prove/disprove any bias in questions. For example, a counter-balancing question might be \"If it were shown that gun control laws were ineffective in preventing crime, would you favor enacting more gun control laws?\" 209 Gallup Poll, May 2000 – this despite a question design which made “availability of guns” the most likely choice due to order ranking.
