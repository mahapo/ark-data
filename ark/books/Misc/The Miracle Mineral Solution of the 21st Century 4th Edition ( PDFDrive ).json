A man I am treating is getting a disease that I don’t even know what cause it, it simply happen over night after a shock fever and cold. Once he wake up in the morning, he found his body full of wet bubbles from one side of his face to his shoulder and chest. He even unable to move his hand cos it will be very painful. He show to me and all I do is ask him, Do you want to try my way or you want to go to hospital? Then he decide to let me try cos it is free. I begin with giving him MMS2 orally four times at one capsule every two hour. The next day, he told me his pain is gone, so I ask him to continue at the same dosage. At the same time, I bring the activated MMS1 10-drop spray for his skin area. On the third day, I was amazed with the progress of the skin. On the seventh day, I see all his problems is dry up so I take another picture of it to prove that MMS is actually working. We may not know it if our disease is inside our body. It work very fast indeed. A lot of people who know him does not believe that this kind of diseases can be cured in just 6 days. Thank you! Edwin, S. Korea"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"1 What This Book is About What This Book is About I f you are new to MMS, I hope you do not think that this book tells about just another interesting supplement that can help some people after they take it for several months. Not so. This Master Mineral Supplement (MMS) works in a few hours. The #1 killer of mankind in the world today is malaria , a disease that is typically overcome by this supplement in only four hours. This has been proven through clinical trials in Malawi , a country in eastern Africa. In killing the malaria parasite in the body, there was not a single failure and at this writing, more than 800 HIV/AIDS cases have been successfully treated in Malawi, with all the before-and- after tests and records in place. More than 5 million people have used MMS worldwide. After taking the Master Mineral Supplement, people are often disease-free in 5 days and other diseases and conditions simply disappear. If patients in the nearest hospital were treated with this Master Mineral, over 50% of them would be back home within a week and 90% would be home before two months were out. For more than 100 years, clinics and hospitals have used the active ingredient\t in\t this\t supplement\t to\t sterilize\t hospital\t floors , tables, equipment, and other items. Now this same powerful germ killer can be harnessed by the immune system to safely kill pathogens in the human body. Amazing as it might seem, when MMS is taken correctly, the immune system can use it to kill only those germs, bacteria and viruses that are harmful to the body. MMS does not affect the friendly bacteria in the body nor any of the healthy cells. It is one of the same chemicals that the body’s immune system manufactures to kill pathogens and other harmful microorganisms in the body. MMS is the greatest solution to mankind’s diseases and ills now known. It is not a drug. I have provided complete details on how to make this supplement in your kitchen, buying most of the ingredients off the shelf. It is entirely possible that you will save someone’s life or your own. Because MMS functions as a supercharger to the immune system, it is not meant for treatment of any particular disease; rather, it has been found to improve the immune system to the point of overcoming most diseases, frequently in less than 24 hours."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2 What This Book is About My purpose for writing this book is to spread the information more widely.

I added some more data and updated everything I knew. But a lot of things were happening. The book urgently needed editing, and all of my friends were threatening to pretend they didn’t know me if I didn’t have it edited. So I had to do that. Then a lot of things happened. The book\t was\t edited,\t and\t my\t secretary\t in\t Nevada\t finally\t got\t it\t printed,\t and\tit\tbegan\tto\tsell\taround\tthe\tfirst\tof\tNovember\t2009. However, while the book was being edited and prepped to print, many\t things\t happened.\t I\t caught\t the\t swine\t flu and lived through it, I left Mexico in a rush, I helped a doctor in South Africa by teaching some of his students about MMS, and I traveled to Malawi and began treating mostly HIV/AIDS, and other life-threatening diseases as well. Something important was happening during this time. All of the data from thousands of sick people around the world had been pouring into my head for several years. I had answered more than 10,000 emails before I hired my secretary. Since I hired her, the two of us have answered an additional 50,000 emails. All those emails were from people who had questions about MMS and how to use it, or a hundred and one different things all concerning their health and using MMS. New Protocols Developed Over a couple of years and thousands of emails, I began to get a picture in my mind and ideas began to gather. Now if I had a staff, and they could have taken each email and put it into a category and sent out requests for results from people, we would have had the results much\t faster.\t But\t anyway,\t I\t finally\t developed\t several\t protocols\t that\t were\t getting\t fantastic\t results\t and\t I\t realized\t that\t my\t first\t book\t didn’t\t give enough data. While MMS is simple to use, people still need more about the basics. Then, with the new protocols approaching 99% results, I realized I needed to write a new book. When I had most of this book written, the protocols\t were\t sort\t of\t solidified.\t I\t had\t been\t approaching\t the\t correct\t protocols,\t but\t the\t final\t results\t happened\t in\t Malawi . Those results with HIV/AIDS were nothing less than fantastic. The disease, when"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"6 treated with the proper MMS protocol, is a snap. It’s as if HIV/AIDS patients only have a bad cold that needs proper care. It’s simple. The protocol lasts for three weeks, but they are over most of their problems\t in\t the\t first\t 4\t days\t and\t the\t rest\t of\t the\t problems\t clear\t up\t in\t the next week, and usually those last few days are just to make sure. So this book was written. Treating Animals I received many emails over a couple of years concerning animals and treating them with MMS -- another thing that had never been written about before. Well, they are mostly like people and I have had considerable experience treating animals, so I added Chapter 18 on treating animals. Information on ARV Drugs Also while in Africa I learned about the ARV (Anti-Retroviral) Drugs. They are touted as being something that helps the African people live longer and more productive lives, and the drug companies take billions of dollars from Africa in payment for ARV drugs. It doesn’t take\t much\t of\t a\t dunce\t to\t find\t out\t that\t these\t drugs\t are\t really\t killing\t the\t African\t people\t while\t doing\t absolutely\t nothing\t beneficial\t for\t them.\t In\t this book, I haven’t gone into ARVs very far, as this book is about positive stuff and speedy health improvement. But Chapter 22 on MMS, ARVs, and Vaccines does include a few things that anyone can check. This is critical information that you need in order to protect yourself and your family. Haiti For the past months, I have been here in the Dominican Republic, right next to Haiti, teaching very intense seminars on MMS. Some of our students have gone over into Haiti to attempt to help there using MMS, but as time passed, it became too dangerous. Our last student group was robbed at gun point for the computer they had. Those people are starving. The situation there is a terrible thing. What is happening there is evil beyond belief and the world will never know. There has been a news blackout for months. The people of Haiti have been murdered for months, and with the news blackout, nothing can be done. Call a news agency and they pay no attention to you."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"7     Foreword This is what happened and is happening at this date, 12/27/10. When the earthquake occurred, the United States sent war ships to close off all the Haitian ports. They have prevented all ships and all supplies, except military, from arriving in the Haitian ports. The cholera epidemic has hit and the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic has been closed, but before it was closed, 80 trucks loaded with supplies for Haiti arrived there while our students were also there. The trucks came from Santo Domingo. They were refused entrance into Haiti and sent back into the Dominican Republic. Do you see? All supplies were prevented from arriving in Haiti. I am sure you heard from the news that there was plenty of money for Haiti, as a number of countries had donated money. The Red Cross announced that they had plenty of money for Haiti. Guess what – our students\t found\t the\t Red\t Cross\t office\t closed\t and\t the\t door\t boarded\t shut. There is no Red Cross in Haiti. None of the money that was slated for Haiti has reached Haiti. It is either still held in deposits not being released or it has already been taken elsewhere. We could not reach anyone concerning the cholera there. At the last count, about a month ago (it’s now 1-15-11), over 1,000 people have died of cholera and there is no mass help being provided. Nothing is really being done. There are no large air lifts of medical supplies or food or water getting to those people. Nothing. We are only a few miles from the border. We know what’s going on there. We have been\t financing\t a\t pastor\t to\t take\t MMS\t over\t there\t and\t treat\t as\t many\t as possible but even that has been stopped now. Those people are being murdered while the rest of the world sits idly by. Of course, most people don’t know, so they can’t do anything. But the news people stay away and don’t report anything and those of us who do report are not listened to. You may be surprised to hear that the same thing happened in New Orleans right after Hurricane Katrina. There was a refugee camp where the trucks of supplies were refused entrance for months for no reason. I don’t think anyone starved, but there was much suffering while the people in the camps waited for trucks to arrive that were sitting idle, waiting for permission to enter the area. The world said nothing about that, as there was a news blackout, and those evil men, whoever they are, found once more that they can do any murderous thing they wish and there is no objection.

The Most Important Underlying Principle of MMS When taking MMS, if it is making you feel worse, something is wrong. MMS does not make people feel worse – it makes them feel better. If you are feeling nausea , diarrhea , fatigue in the extreme, a very bad headache or if your original condition is worsening, then something is wrong. Normally, just take less MMS but do not stop. This will handle 99 cases out of 100, but not all. •\t If you reduced your MMS intake by 50% and that didn’t help, try reducing it even more. •\t If that doesn’t help, stop taking MMS altogether. Wait until you are back feeling like you were before taking MMS and then start again with a much smaller dose. •\t If that doesn’t work something else is wrong. An Example of Something Wrong My apartment is in the tropics and the heat was getting to me. I called the air conditioning guys and they came and installed an air conditioner on the wall. They said that there were too many windows so they covered each one with clear plastic. You could hardly tell that they were covered, but the fact is that they no longer allowed air to come in. Well, after a several weeks I begin to lose energy during the day. In a couple more weeks I was taking shorter walks and more and longer naps during the day. I was beginning to feel sickish. I decided to start Protocol 1000 (see Chapter 13). But in two days I was feeling even worse. I decided to listen to my own technology. I knew something terrible was wrong because I felt like I was dying and I was beginning to wonder if it was just my body turning off and I was dying of old age. Then\t I\t happened\t to\t look\t at\t a\t window\t with\t the\t sun\t reflecting\t off\t of\t the\t clear\t plastic\t and\t it\t hit\t me\t --\t it\t must\t be\t my\t apartment.\t I\t first\t got\t a pound of the chemical that MMS is made of, closed the door, and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"9     Foreword totally bathed the apartment in the MMS gas, just as they did with the New Orleans restaurants after Hurricane Katrina. I did that in case there might be some poison in the apartment. I slept elsewhere that night. Then I had all the plastic removed from the windows, 8 of them. Then I\t put\t 2\t floor\t fans\t turned\t on\t high,\t one\t at\t each\t end\t of\t the\t apartment,\t one blowing in, and one blowing out. Well guess what? Two days and I was back feeling normal. Do you see what was happening? For weeks I was breathing in the carbon dioxide that my own lungs were expelling. I was losing more and more energy and getting sicker and sicker and MMS could not compensate for the loss of oxygen . The carbon dioxide was creating poisons and the MMS was trying to destroy them but it was just mixing with foods and other items in my system, making a mess. I don’t think that was the brink of death but it was beginning to feel like it.As I was congratulating myself on solving this problem, I began feeling worse again. Working and sleeping in this apartment, I was now breathing in plenty of oxygen, so what else\t could\t be\t wrong?\t I\t was\t sneezing\t and\t sniffling \tand\t over\t the\t next\t few\t days,\t my\t energy\t flagged\t and\t I\t took\t to\t sleeping\t elsewhere\t again. One day, I was listlessly reading emails while the cleaning lady washed dishes and swept and dusted. I watched vaguely while she whisked a dust rag around on the furniture and counters and my eyes gazed at the dust motes dancing in a ray of sun. I sat up straight. Dust! We have no vacuum cleaner and the dust rag was distributing old dust into the air for me to breathe. Years-old dust. And fresh dust blown in daily through the 8 windows. We started having my cleaning lady use a wet mop instead of a broom and a wet rag to remove dust from furniture. In the following days, my energy again returned and my cold-like symptoms faded. Since then, I have felt alert and clear and am back to a maintenance dose of MMS instead of Protocol 1000. •\t In other words, my underlying problems – lack of oxygen and ambient dust – were not problems that MMS could address. So remember, MMS makes people feel better, not worse, and if you feel worse while taking MMS, something is wrong other than what you already know about. Figure out what it is, address it, and then resume taking MMS for whatever problem you originally took"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"it for. In my case, there was only one problem and it was solved by increasing my oxygen intake. But it is common for people to have multiple health problems simultaneously and MMS may not always address them all. This Book Written in Stages At the last minute, in book-writing time, I decided not to change everything in the whole book, but rather to solidify the latest protocols that, to me, are real magic, separately in Chapter 13 as Protocol 1000 , Protocol 2000 and Protocol 3000 . Every severe disease you can think of, such as cancer , hepatitis C, HIV, AIDS, or malaria are all simple to heal when following these protocols. They are a bit intense for a while, but the results are what you would hope for from a “Miracle” Mineral -- now called the Master Mineral Solution. This\t book\t builds\t on\t what\t the\t first\t book\t started.\t Imagine\t mankind\t without incurable diseases of any kind. I should also mention that there are things that MMS does not handle, such as described in the story above, but there are other medicines and herbs that do handle those, so nothing is left out. I want people to read this whole book and to know how MMS evolved, as that makes people more conscious of what needs to be done. I want a world of people who know all about MMS, so the data will never be lost. Please read this whole book and then know that with Protocols 1000 and 2000 plus Protocol 3000 from time to time and a couple of dozen lesser protocols, we can handle 99% of the incurable diseases known to man. Other less terrible diseases are also covered. Please learn the data in this book. There is no doubt that someday it will eventually save your life, and probably the lives of a number of people as you go along. You may be a healthy young person and thus never need MMS but all older people eventually need help, and that help comes with MMS. Please live to over a hundred years in good health. If you know MMS, barring an accident, you will indeed live beyond 100. Thanks for your interest. Bishop Jim Humble #####"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"11 Special Note From the Author Special Note From the Author I did not invent the idea of using sodium chlorite to generate chlorine\t dioxide.\t If\t you\t read\t Chapter\t 22\t of\t my\t first\t book,\t The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21st Century, you will learn how chlorine dioxide has been used in the body by many others for 20 years or more. I have merely brought it to the attention of the public when it never would have been otherwise. Over the past 12 years, I have had a more diverse experience with it than any other person. I\t admit\t that\t at\t first\t I\t thought\t I\t was\t the\t inventor . I did invent it, but I was the second or third inventor, maybe even the tenth. Others were already using it on a very limited basis, and had been for many years. I have expanded its use and shared it with the public. And I did invent a number of the protocols, all those in this book. So\t I\t will\t agree\t with\t anybody\t who\t says\t that\t I\t was\t not\t the\t first\t inventor.\t I\t don’t\t know\t who\t first\t used\t chlorine dioxide in the human body. The literature is unclear, as sodium chlorite has been used for many years by many different researchers, and it has been used in the body by hundreds of researchers without them ever realizing that the results they were achieving were due to chlorine dioxide. In these cases, the researchers thought they were furnishing oxygen to the body. In each case, the research was limited to only several diseases or several types of diseases. Research was conducted in several colleges in each case with the researchers believing that they were working with oxygen. So, as far as patents are concerned, I cannot\t claim\t first\t use,\t and\t thus\t cannot\t obtain a patent. Of course, I did not want and do not want a patent. I just want to see MMS used throughout the world and that is indeed happening. This does not mean that I am giving up any of my rights that might exist for this technology. Should someone misuse the technology, I could still withhold from"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 Special Note From the Author them any of the rights that I still have. I do own all the copyrights on the written material on MMS1 and MMS2, as the only person who has written about them is me. Before I began using them, no one else knew anything to write. No one used it for more than one or two different diseases. I began using it for all diseases. Thus, anyone writing about MMS must use some of my writings. Therefore they must get my permission. I give it freely unless they misuse the data or sell the information. In the case of commercial use of my material, that will be easy, but everyone using the material commercially must get my permission. #####"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"13 Financial Condition of the MMS Movement Financial Condition of the MMS Movement W hat this book is dedicated to, the suffering people of the world, pretty much says it all. For years, I thought that sooner or later some really wealthy person or group would come along and see what we are doing and put up millions of dollars to help spread MMS to mankind. But now hundreds of those wealthy people have seen or heard of MMS and they have not come up with the money. The wealthy people of the world are not going to help. No Help From Bill or Oprah After 10 years, I have come to realize that that kind of money is not coming. I’ve written to the TV programs that help with these kinds of things,\t and\t no\t help\t there.\t Bill\t Gates\t is\t after\t prestige\t in\t the\t scientific\t medical\t field,\t but\t not\t particularly\t interested\t in\t helping\t the\t millions\t who\t are\t out\t there.\t I\t have\t five\t rejections\t from\t Bill\t and\t he\t has\t made\t statements that there are too many people on this Earth and some must be allowed to die. Oprah has built a 50 million dollar orphanage to help a very small number of orphans in South Africa when that 50 million could have helped thousands. The buildings and grounds are beautiful and it is a very prestigious operation. But it wasn’t to help the people, it was for show. Don’t let me say that is wrong -- a good show brings money and that money can hopefully be used for good, and Oprah is a genius at show. This orphanage is no exception. However, I could not get the interest of her people who must decide on these things. Similar scenarios\t were\t repeated \tuntil\t I\t realized\t it\t was\t pointless.\t Now\t I\t find\t Oprah is working with Bill Gates. I am beginning to learn things about the world and people. Large amounts of money are always controlled by men or women of ambition.\t If\t those\t in\t control\t don’t\t see\t huge\t advantages\t or\t profits\t for\t themselves, the money never really gets put forward. There is a lot of talk, but when it really comes right down to putting the money out, even the US government reneges on its money promises. It’s never really the government on these kinds of things, it’s the people who are in control. You may think, and it is always said, that there are large amounts of money for this kind of thing, but the actual facts are that the money, all of it, is under the control of men who"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"14 Financial Condition of theMMS Movement could not care less about those the money is said to be for. For most of my adult life, I have been associated with people who were or are waiting for large amounts of money from somewhere. The money was always designated to help someone and do some good somewhere, but of more than a dozen different groups or individuals, no one ever got the large amount of money they were promised. Some waited for 20 years while wasting their time. Abuse of the Scientific Method In the case of MMS and other kinds of medicines, even when hundreds of thousands have been restored to health, the medical drug\t profession\t has\t created\t an\t atmosphere\t based\t on\t the\t “scientific\t method” that seeks to stop ideas like MMS from ever becoming known. When I seek help, I always hear the questions: •\t What about clinical trials? •\t What have you done there? •\t Where\tare\tthe\tscientific\twrite-ups\tin\tthe\tmedical\tjournals? They talk as if I were a multi-millionaire who was not doing my job right. In those conversations, it never occurs to anyone that I may not have had the money for those things. I say, “What about the hundred thousand malaria cases treated with no deaths? What about the thousands of emails?” But none of that counts. Abuse\t of\t the\t scientific\t method,\t marveled\t at\t by\t the\t medical\t drug\t profession, has precluded anything coming from anywhere other than\t the\t scientific\t multimillion-dollar\t laboratories.\t It\t isn’t\t that\t you\t can’t listen to 100,000 common people saying that they are no longer sick, or 100 cancer patients saying that their cancer went away in two\t weeks.\t It\t is\t that\t the\t scientific\t medical\t drug\t gods\t have\t convinced\t the\tworld\tthat\tyou\tcannot\tever\tdepend\ton\tsuch\tunscientific\tdata. Black Periods in Medical History In the 1920s, William Koch and Royal Rife found the cause of cancer to be a pleomorphic microbe. It is usually in virus form but can morph into a bacterium, depending on the body conditions, and back to a virus. It is very tiny and hard to see but a special type of microscope was\t invented\t at\t that\t time\t that\t could\t show\t it.\t And\t now\t the\t dark\t field\t microscope shows it. At\t first,\t Koch\t and\t Rife\t received\t recognition\t for\t their\t discovery\t but\t"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"15 Financial Condition of theMMS Movement as Koch, in particular, went ahead and cured many people of their cancer , the medical establishment turned against him. By the time he and his associates had cured about 100,000 people, the special microscopes\t were\t being\t destroyed\t by\t government\t officials,\t along\t with books on the subject and laboratory equipment, and Koch was arrested. He was tried in court and hundreds of people came to court to say that they were cured of cancer. The judge instructed the jury not to listen\t to\t any\t of\t them.\t It\t would\t be\t “unscientific”\t –\t anecdotal\t evidence does not cut any ice with establishment doctors. Koch was never convicted but he was jailed anyway, being held in jail while awaiting trial and during trial. He defended himself to the end and died in financial\truin. And in the Nineteenth Century Compare the above story with that of Ignaz Semmelweiss. Semmelweiss was an Austrian obstetrician in the mid-nineteenth century. He worked at Vienna General Hospital and after a while he noticed that women who gave birth in the hospital were dying far more frequently than those who gave birth at home with a midwife. They contracted puerperal fever shortly after the birth. Their babies were also dying more often. He eventually traced this problem to the fact that his colleagues in the hospital were moving back and forth from work in the attached morgue to work in the delivery room without washing their hands. They wore the same bloody aprons while delivering babies as they had just been wearing while dissecting a cadaver. When Semmelweiss mentioned this to them, some understood and began washing their hands and changing their clothing. But most were outraged. What? Are you calling us dirty?? We’re trained pro- fessionals. We know what we’re doing.

The Multi-Billion-Dollar Barrier In our era, extensive research under FDA (Food and Drug Adminis - tration) supervision is regarded as the only way to establish a medical truth.

They are not even considered worth investigating.

If you cure a sick person, he won’t pay you any more money. That is a self-evident truth that the laymen of the world do not seem to consider. Don’t you think it is kind of funny that after 100 years of the new scientific\t modern\t technology,\t not\t one\t single\t cure for a single disease has ever been found? Doesn’t it seem crazy that the exact same cancer treatments have been in use, with no practical improvements, for 100 years, and still less than 3% of patients recover? So\t there\t is\t no\t point\t in\t spinning\t my\t wheels\t with\t trying\t to\t find\t the\t large donations that would be required for us to complete large-scale MMS testing. I must just go ahead with what is being done to spread MMS information. So I have done my work in Africa, I teach classes, and I write.

I did that in Africa in 2009 and up to February, 2010. I have recently worked with hundreds of people in Africa working slowly, very slowly, to improve the protocol necessary to make MMS really effective. Finally we had a group of people (800) with whom we had less than 5 failures in overcoming the HIV/AIDS disease. Who can argue with 800 successes, with blood tests done before the MMS protocol establishing a positive HIV reading. I did that work in Africa after writing the previous book, so this book is designed to cover the new developments. However, each book tells only part of the continuing story. There is more on this story of 800 HIV patients in Chapter 27, HIV/AIDS in Malawi. From what I see so far, after much experience at not getting grants from the huge amount of money that is supposed to be available for Africa, it is my opinion that the money is never going to come. Hundreds of thousands of lives have already been saved and millions of people around the world are using MMS. Those whose job it is to grant the large amounts of money will continue to say, “Where are the clinical trials and the millions of dollars’ worth of proof?” and we will continue to not have those millions. But still, more and more people will continue to use MMS and millions of lives will be saved. The sales of MMS will carry it into the countries of Africa and Asia. I make no money from the sales, but there will always be those who do, and because there are so many manufacturers, the price will tend to stay low and MMS will continue to spread at a rapid rate across the world. This is where you, the reader, come in. Although the huge amounts of money will never be available, there are now thousands of us small guys with small amounts of money, and when put together, we can be effective.

Some of it is my opinion; however, I have discussed all of this information with medical doctors and they have agreed with me. But then, that is their opinion as well. So this is what appears to be happening in the body when activated MMS is ingested. Organisms Destroyed MMS destroys microorganisms, including viruses bacteria , fungus, molds, yeast, and parasites that causes various diseases . Viruses are killed by a different mechanism than bacteria and all the other microorganisms: MMS prevents the formation of special proteins necessary for viral growth, thus causing the destruction of the virus. The killing of disease-causing organisms generally takes between 4 hours and 4 weeks, but often less than one week. This is true for all forms of infection and other microorganisms, as well as blood diseases such as leukemia . Heavy Metals Oxidized MMS oxidizes the heavy metals in the body. I believe this because there have been a number of tests where the roots of a person’s hair were checked before and after taking MMS. About two weeks afterwards, the heavy metals were gone, including mercury , lead, and others. Testing the roots of hair is a good indication of the absence or presence of heavy metals. Oxidation of the heavy metals is not the same as chelating but the results are the same. When a heavy metal is oxidized, it is neutralized and simply washes out of the body. Foreign Matter Neutralized MMS is carried throughout the body, where it neutralizes foreign matter that is generally poisonous. When oxidized, poisons are neutralized and they merely washed out of the body. Almost all poisonous material is easily oxidized. These poisons are attached at various locations and hinder the body’s function. As they are oxidized, they are detached and washed out of the body same as the heavy metals. Poisons Neutralized Most forms of poisons from snakes and other venomous animals"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"24 MMS\tBenefits\tSummary are oxidized when adequate amounts of MMS are taken.

Burns Healed The poisons generated by burns particularly type 3 burns, are neutralized when covered immediately (or even within hours) with MMS. MMS should not be left on more than 5 minutes. It must then be rinsed off with water. This can be done twice for a total of having MMS on the burn for 10 minutes, no longer in most cases. But as long as there is pain, one can continue to put MMS on the burn for short periods, but never more than 5 minutes. #####"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"25 MMS Quick Reference Guide MMS Quick Reference Guide A lways use an activator with each drop of MMS1. Use 5 drops of lemon or lime juice or 10% citric acid, or one drop of 50% citric. Use 5 drops of vinegar in emergencies when lemon, lime, or citric acid are not available. See Chapter 12 for more on making MMS. See Chapter 13 for complete descriptions of protocols and how to use them. If diarrhea, nausea or fatigue is severe, stop MMS until they are gone. They are reactions to too much MMS so start again immediately but\t with\t smaller\t doses.\t Increase\t as\t soon\t as\t possible.\t Many\t find\t that eating a raw apple 15 minutes before taking MMS helps to prevent nausea.

Start\t with\t a\t quarter,\t a\t half,\t or\t one\t drop\t for\t the\t first\t hour,\t depending\t on how sick the person is. The sicker he is, the less MMS he should have.\t If\t the\t first\t dose\t does\t not\t cause\t a\t reaction,\t go\t to\t the\t next\t larger\t dose on the second or third hour.

Never go to the next Protocol if the person is improving. If no improvement on Protocol 1000 after two weeks, then go to Protocol 2000.

If dialysis is involved, start at an eighth of a drop per hour. If starting here, begin with a quarter, half, or one drop, depending on how sick the person is. Increase the drops per hour as fast as you can but without causing nausea or diarrhea. If possible, spray the cancer with 10 activated drops in each ounce of water once an hour for a few hours, and then once every two hours. As long as you can see improvement from spraying once an hour, do not stop. If there is no noticeable improvement with Protocol 2000 in a few days (5 or more), then add Protocol 3000 or add 3000 right away if you think it will help. Normally, do not start with Protocol 3000 (Ch. 13, p. 72) but sometimes it might be indicated for a light treatment of MMS. Begin by spraying an arm with MMS. Use 20 drops of activated MMS for each ounce of water. This is twice the strength of MMS that is sprayed on the body for all other problems. Immediately add DMSO and mix by rubbing it in, as it is too strong if not mixed with DMSO. Be sure to see Chapter 13 for details. If there is still no slight improvement begin using the bag (Ch. 24, p. 194). Never spend more than 10 minutes in the bag. For maximum safety, only spend 5 minutes in the bag. You can also add the following: •\t Douche: Use 2 glasses of water or a quart with 8 drops per glass (one drop per ounce, activated as always). •\t Skin spray: Use 10 drops per ounce (40 drops for half a glass of water). Spray any skin problem hourly and also take MMS by mouth. Never go to the next protocol if the patient is improving. WARNING Remember – any time the patient seems to get worse or reacts to MMS with diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, or extreme tiredness, reduce the dose. Or stop until the reaction goes away, then start back at a lower dose. Never think it is alright to continue MMS when the person is feeling worse. Stop and wait until he is back to how he was when you started, and then start MMS again."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"27 MMS Quick Reference Guide Some Common Situations •\t Asthma, heart problems, diabetes, epilepsy – Protocol 1000 •\t Bad problems – Protocol 1000 •\t Cancer – Protocol 2000 which is taking MMS1 hourly 10 hours a day, but use as many drops per hour as you can stand without getting nausea, diarrhea, or severe fatigue.

I thought in the beginning and for some time that critics would care about truth, common sense, logic, or common decency. And I also thought that radio stations, TV news casts and internet news casts would have some consideration about these same things. But no, none of these critics have shown the slightest consideration in those directions. There are basically two kinds of critics. 1. Those who are lying and know they are lying 2. Those who believe their own rhetoric and are unwilling to check what they are saying The critics who lie about MMS are in some way connected to the pharmaceutical companies by money. They are the ones that are talking to the public through TV, radio, and the internet or they are doctors who dispense drugs of some kind. The doctor makes money from the drug. They are also the commentators and the writers of the news. They are among the evil people of this world, as they prevent thousands from being relieved of their suffering, or they cause them to die when they could have lived out a good life. About Decency Five million people have used MMS. Jim Humble has treated more than 5000 people personally. Several hundred thousand lives have been saved. But what if MMS didn’t work and no one had been saved? Would it not still be common decency to at least say, “I don’t know, but I’ll at least check MMS out.” If MMS does work and you tell people it doesn’t, they will go away and continue to suffer when that isn’t necessary. It would be common decency to consider one’s responsibility to others. If you talk off of the top of your head without checking the data, and your data is wrong, you can cost someone their life or cause much suffering. Being responsible for what you say concerning things such as MMS is just common decency. However, decency has not been a priority. All critics have refused to check the facts. A decent critic would have: •\t Read the chemistry instead of assuming that they know it;"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"32 Critics of MMS and Jim Humble •\t Checked one or two people who claim to be healed; and/or •\t Tried it for themselves. About Truth When someone just begins talking because he thinks he knows the truth about something without checking, especially something that affects people’s lives, it shows he cares little for the truth and little for people’s lives, and he thinks that somehow he knows the truth about all things. If he didn’t think that, he would not act as if he knows all things and does not need to check the truth. All the critics have acted in this way. That is true because those who have checked the truth are no long critics. About Common Sense and Logic My books and the internet contain common sense about chlorine dioxide (that’s MMS) that will tell you right off the bat that MMS works. One might not blame too heavily an uneducated yokel from Alabama for not understanding the logic, but people with doctor’s degrees should have the decency and intelligence to at least use common logic in their critical remarks. But again, all the critics have refused to look at the common logic of it because that means that they would have to read some chemistry. Either that, or, as mentioned above, they are connected to the pharmaceuticals in some way by money. So let me just cover several points of logic that the critics refuse to observe. Someone once said that there is no one more blind than those\t who\t won’t\t see.\t And\t of\t course\t the\t critics\t fit\t that\t description\t exceptionally well. You may ask at this point, why do you include all critics? Might some of them be right? Well, the point is: \t All critics who have checked their data are no longer critics! Those who refuse to see are still critics and that includes the educated ones, doctors and scientists as well as yokels. I have suc- cessfully treated more than 5000 sick people, yet I have medical doctors telling me that I am lying and they know I am a liar. I want to say a little about the logic of MMS and ask you to use your plain old logic which I call just common sense. You would think that the critics would have found something that it makes sense to"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"33 Critics of MMS and Jim Humble criticize, but no, they don’t seem to care about making sense. The Critics’ False Claims Critics’ False Claim #1 There is no way that MMS (chlorine dioxide ) can differentiate between pathogens and beneficial bacteria. The critics seem to grasp on to this notion with extreme force and without checking anything but their own beliefs. Fact #1 There are differences between pathogens \tand\tbeneficial\tbacteria . •\t Pathogens create a waste material that is poisonous to the body. That’s why they make you sick with a disease. Many of them will eventually kill the body with their waste poisons (that is their disease). On the other hand: •\t Beneficial\t bacteria\t do\t not\t generate\t any\t poisonous\t material.\t Wouldn’t you believe that a little logic would at least make you think there might be a way of differentiating between the two different kinds of microorganisms? One generates a poison and the other does not. Fact #2 All organisms and body cells and even liquids have an ORP (Oxidation Reduction Potential) that can be either positive or negative. The ORP is the electrical charge that cells exert on other things in their immediate environment. Oxidizers also have an ORP, mostly called Oxidation Potential , and all oxidizers have a positive potential. Now an interesting point: •\t All pathogens (poison producers) have a negative ORP; and •\t All\tbeneficial\tbacteria\thave\ta\tpositive\tORP. The Fact #2 paragraph above is the data; now let’s look at the logic of it. \t Oxygen runs through the body killing many of the pathogens but not killing any of the beneficial bacteria. Every day the body uses oxygen to kill many of the pathogens that\t cause\t inflammation.\t The\t oxygen\t is\t positively\t charged.\t The beneficial\tbacteria\tare\tpositively\tcharged.\t"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"34 Critics of MMS and Jim Humble Now isn’t that funny. For thousands of years, oxygen has been destroying\t pathogens\t while\t leaving\t beneficial\t bacteria unaffected, and not one single critic leaps up and proclaims that nature is lying and just trying to make money off the ignorant. But the fact is: •\t If\t oxygen\t couldn’t\t kill\t pathogens\t without\t killing\t beneficial\t bacteria, life would not exist as we know it on Earth today. •\t The chemistry of MMS (chlorine dioxide) is more likely to kill pathogens\tand\tnot\tkill\tbeneficial\tbacteria\tthan\toxygen. Remember your high school science class, “Positive charges repel one\t another.”\t Thus\t the\t oxygen\t never\t touches\t the\t beneficial\t bacteria\t and\t thus\t the\t beneficial\t bacteria\t are\t not\t destroyed.\t On\t the\t other\t hand,\t pathogens have a negative ORP. Remember the rule that opposite charges attract one another. Thus the pathogens are attracted to the oxygen and are destroyed instantly. Consider this: like oxygen, MMS (chlorine dioxide) is an oxidizer except it has a much lower oxidation potential . The logical point is that\t the\t chemistry\t is\t similar\t and\t it\t will\t not\t kill\t the\t beneficial\t bacteria\t because they are positive and MMS is positive. It repels the beneficial\t bacteria.\t And\t like\t oxygen,\t it\t does\t kill\t pathogens . Because of its positive charge, it is attracted to the negative poison generated by the pathogens in the same manner as oxygen is attracted to the pathogens. And like oxygen, it also destroys some of the poisons generated by the pathogens. Health enthusiasts have proclaimed the\t benefits\t of\t oxygen\t for\t a\t hundred\t years,\t and\t one\t of\t their\t basic\t facts is that oxygen destroys poisons. Another point of chemical data and logic: Human tissue cells also have a weak positive charge. This gives MMS an advantage over oxygen: •\t Because it is a much weaker oxidizer than oxygen, with a much lower oxidization potential, it can sink deeper into the tissues than oxygen before it is destroyed by oxidation. Because it can go deeper into the tissues, it kills more pathogens than oxygen. Critics’ False Claim #2 Since MMS (chlorine dioxide) is considered to be industrial bleach and an oxidizer, it must diesel through the body, killing pathogens and also destroying tissues, doing much damage. MMS is 28%"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"35 Critics of MMS and Jim Humble MMS chemical and thus is as strong as an industrial bleach. The critics love referring to MMS as a “bleach”. They hope to create an image of a person chugging down a bottle of Clorox . Factual Point A Any chemical on earth is poisonous in large quantities. In large quantities, table salt will kill you. Factual Point B Only 3 drops are normally used in a dose of MMS. Those three drops are diluted 675 times so instead of a 28% solution they make a 0.00004% solution. I hope you understand percentages as that is about one tenth the amount of chemical as the amount of salt that you would put on your dinner. For extreme cases of cancer, one might use up to half the amount of MMS chemical as salt you would put on your dinner, or about a 0.00008% solution in half a glass of water. Sorry critics, but this small dose cannot damage the body. Factual Point C Chlorine dioxide has never anywhere in the world been used as a household bleach or a toilet cleaner or as any other kind of a household cleaner. \t Chlorine dioxide is not the same thing as Clorox and it is used only in industry Factual point D Approximately 5 million people have used MMS. All the claims of liver damage and other body organs are pure fantasy. No such damage to the liver has ever been recorded. Remember, body cells repel from MMS. For one hundred years, MMS (chlorine dioxide ) has been used in industry. Over all those years critics cannot produce one single study showing damage to a human body by chlorine dioxide unless it was extremely concentrated chlorine dioxide thousands of times more potent than MMS. •\t There\t are\t less\t than\t five\t cases\t of\t body\t damage\t known\t for\t extremely concentrated chlorine dioxide and no deaths. The only thing critics can point to are speculations by doctors who do not understand the chemistry of chlorine dioxide . None of the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"36 Critics of MMS and Jim Humble doctors that are being critics have read the chemistry of chlorine dioxide. They show their ignorance with every point they make. Factual point E The walls of your intestines, various organs, blood vessels, and even your skin are at least 1/32 of an inch thick. The walls of a pathogen , that is, its outer covering membrane, are about one ten thousandth of an inch thick. That is at the very least 1000 times thinner than the walls of body organs. Do you see any difference there? The extremely diluted solution of MMS tears through a 1/10,000 inch pathogen cell wall instantly, but obviously can’t affect a wall thousands of times thicker – and remember the body wall is going to repel MMS while the pathogen wall is going to attract it. Only in accidental cases will the MMS happen to hit against an organ wall and the destruction of a single cell will not be noticed by the body. But even if everyone one of those MMS molecules in a dose of MMS hit the sides of body organs, or even if all of them hit only one organ, it still wouldn’t do enough damage to make a difference. Do you see the logic here? •\t A couple of grains of 0.00008% MMS (chlorine dioxide) solution is too weak to damage the body. Critics’ False Claim #3 A woman in Australia died of 2 drops of MMS. It was reported in the local paper as a suspicious death but every critic reports it as a fact. Factual point The news report wasn’t published until a year after the death. I have given 2 drops to a mouse and it didn’t kill him or even make him sick. The autopsy report wasn’t published. Maybe it said that she died of MMS and maybe it didn’t. If it did, it was a lie, but I doubt that it was reported in that way. MMS lasts in the body for less than 1.5 hours, by which point it has turned into table salt and discharged oxygen which becomes carbon dioxide . There is not enough of either one of those things to record. Three drops diluted 675 times would be about a 0.00004% solution in half a glass of water. Somebody said that the type of damage caused"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"37 Critics of MMS and Jim Humble by chlorine dioxide can be determined and that it had been found in her body, but again that is a lie. The only damage that chlorine dioxide creates is oxidation and absolutely nothing else. Chlorine dioxide turns into table salt and 2 drops of sodium chlorite make only about\t 5\t grains\t of\t salt.\t The\t best\t scientific\t equipment\t known\t to\t man\t cannot trace 5 grains of table salt after two weeks in a body, as that salt is distributed throughout the body and cannot be detected. Once the oxidation is done, one cannot tell if it was done by oxygen or by chlorine dioxide , or for that matter, by hydrogen peroxide or ozone . There is no way that anyone could have determined that the woman died from two drops of MMS. It could have been oxygen and probably was, since there was 10,000 times as much oxygen in her body as MMS. But the most likely thing is that the death wasn’t even caused by oxidation. So you see there is no logic to blaming it on MMS, or on oxygen for that matter. Critics’ Avoidance of an Alarming Fact 900,000 people die from drugs in the USA alone every year and pretty much the same number for the rest of the world. All the critics seem to totally refuse to admit or confront this fact. That is more than a million times more deaths recorded worldwide for drugs than for MMS and no-one worries about those deaths. None of my critics jump up and say, “These drug companies are just after money.” In fact the critics that I have talked to seem to think it is OK that these people die. It just isn’t OK for MMS because I am supposedly making money from selling MMS. But the fact is that I am not. I am the Bishop of the Genesis 2 Church . The Church furnishes my apartment and food in the Dominican Republic but pays me no salary. We make no money from the sales of MMS. The Church income is from seminars and the sales of DVDs, and this keeps the Church movement going. When I die, the next Bishop will take over and nothing of the Church will go to my relatives. I am a Corporation Sole, but recorded from the time of Christ rather than in any present country.

But that is not logic – that is stupidity. It is evil. The fact is that none of those people needed to have died. The idea that it is OK to kill thousands of people in order to help some others is beyond ridiculous, but doctors buy this logic, and the public has become accustomed to it. On the other side of the coin, critics of all kinds have been stating that MMS must be stopped because it might hurt someone. At the same time, they have refused to look at the fact that MMS has healed hundreds of thousands. That, they say, is just anecdotal information. But the fact is that anecdotal information coming from thousands of people is very useful. Does anybody see any illogic here? It’s OK for drugs to kill thousands, but we have to stop using MMS in case it hurts someone. Some Logic for a Change You should know that in all the world, with 5 million people who have used MMS, only one person has ever been reported as dying while on an MMS protocol and that person was simply too sick from the beginning to be helped. But my people have got to try -- as I always say: “Never give up on anyone, no matter how bad off they appear.” In this one case, we tried but failed.

You may have thousands of times more stuff that needs to be oxidized than a few drops can handle, but MMS is working on it. The fact that you get sick or have diarrhea when you take a heavier dose proves that it is oxidizing the stuff and your body can only throw off a certain amount each day. If you give it more to throw off than it can handle, then it will get violent with vomiting or diarrhea or both. Keep the dosage up, but just under the nausea level. You will eventually get there. Just know that it is working as long as it makes you sick when you take too much. When increased doses quit making you sick, you will be well.

If this does not work, add 1,000 to 5,000 mg of vitamin C to a glass of water and drink. Sodium bicarbonate also acts as an antidote. Use a level teaspoon of bicarbonate or take an Alka-Selt- zer tablet in a glass of water. •\t If you use the vitamin C, do not also use the sodium bicarbonate or Alka-Seltzer. Use either one, but not both. While it is possible to drink as much as several tablespoons of un- activated MMS straight from the bottle, doing so would make you very sick. In the event of an overdose of MMS (sodium chlorite) — you have consumed more than half a teaspoon of MMS—you should immediately begin drinking as much water as possible. It is best to add a half teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate to each glass of water but if you don’t have it, don’t wait for it. Drink water right away. Allow yourself to vomit after drinking the water, then repeat the process. Be sure to see a doctor or emergency poison clinic and explain that you have taken a sodium chlorite solution in excess. Normally, however, once you quit vomiting , you should be OK. Do Not Overdose Whether you are treating yourself or someone else, too much activated MMS will make the body react uncomfortably: •\t Nausea •\t Vomiting •\t Diarrhea •\t Severe fatigue You may experience any or all of those reactions. They are normal when you have taken too much MMS at one time. It has done its job and killed pathogens but the body cannot dispose of the dead pathogens quickly enough. Their presence in your body causes these temporary reactions. A severe overdose of MMS could be life- threatening. Please see the Antidotes section above.

Pain and discomfort rob you of the energy needed to heal and cause the healing to go slower, not faster. You need to determine how much MMS you can take in each dose to stay just below the level of those four reactions (nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and fatigue). Each time a pathogen is killed, it releases toxins into the body and you need time to clear them out of the way to make room for the next wave of dead pathogens. •\t When using Protocol 2000 , try to determine your individual balancing point, where you are taking the maximum amount of MMS you can tolerate without suffering unduly from those four reactions. •\t In Protocol 1000 , never go over 3 drops per hour.

What is MMS? M MS is a unique chemical oxidizer that has the ability to enter the body, kill pathogens that are causing diseases, and touch absolutely nothing else. ( Please read Chapter 20 , Chemical Explanation of MMS and Other Data for Laymen and Scientists. ) There is an exception to this statement -- MMS also destroys heavy metal compounds in the body, and many different poisons. MMS, in the strength used to kill pathogens, can move through the stomach, through the blood, and through various other organs, and cause\t no\t reaction\t or\t damage\t of\t any\t kind.\t It\t does\t not\t affect\t beneficial\t bacteria. The reason for this unique ability is that the MMS chemical is a very weak oxidizer with an oxidation potential of plus 0.95 volts. •\t The body also has a positive oxidation potential and positive charges repel one another. •\t MMS\t is\t basically\t neutral\t to\t the\t body,\t to\t beneficial\t bacteria,\t and to medical drugs. The body’s positive charge is much weaker than that of MMS and thus there may be an accidental collision on occasion which would destroy a cell, but not enough to make a difference. MMS is a much weaker oxidizer than oxygen and thus cannot even do the damage that is often attributed to oxygen. Chemically speaking, there is nothing in the body that can be oxidized by the MMS chemical in the low concentrations that are used. The low concentrations are less than 0.00008%. The only thing that MMS can do in the body is kill disease. It is used by the immune system which, of course, kills pathogens, and causes the death of viruses by preventing them from forming certain proteins. The body itself produces this same chemical because of its unique properties and has been using it for hundreds of thousands of years. It can kill pathogens of all kinds and remain in the body without doing any damage to it. However, because of the energy required to manufacture it and because it remains in the body for only one to one-and-half hours before breaking down, the body often comes up short. MMS supplies the body with extra chemical so for a short while, the immune system has plenty to use as needed. After the one to one-and-a-half hours, a dose of MMS turns into a"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"44 What is MMS? couple of grains of table salt. It’s not enough salt to affect salt-free diets or to even notice. There are also a couple of discharged oxygen atoms that just become a part of the body’s water or carbon dioxide. Chlorine Dioxide The chemical (mineral) that is generated by MMS is chlorine dioxide . Now please do not become concerned that this means it is somehow chlorine. It is no more kindred to chlorine than table salt, which as you know, is made of chlorine . Chlorine dioxide has been used to purify water for 80 years and has been sold in chemical form in health food stores for 80 years in the form of sodium chlorite , known as stabilized oxygen . When we mention Master Mineral we are referring to the mineral chlorine dioxide which is derived from sodium chlorite. Sodium chlorite is found in the natural mineral state many places in the world; however, normally it is cheaper to manufacture it than to mine it. Still, it is considered to be a mineral in either case, and in fact, anything that is not animal or vegetable is a mineral. Keep in mind that sodium chlorite and table salt sound almost the same. It is sodium chloride that is table salt. Note the last two letters of the world chlori te and chlori de. There is some controversy concerning the concept that the body generates chlorine dioxide. It has been stated both that it does and it doesn’t generate chlorine dioxide. However chlorine dioxide is often detected in the body when one has not had contact with any known source. It is a moot point, as the diseases are destroyed when MMS (chlorine dioxide) has been added to the body.

You can use tartaric acid, citric acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and sulfamic acid but not ascorbic acid as it prevents the chemical reaction required to make MMS work.

All the mineral acids\t can\t be\t used\t except\t hydrofluoric\t acid.\t It\t was\t put\t in\t our\t water\t supplies to keep our teeth hard, they say.

Most\t water\t supplies\t contain\t hydrofluoric\t acid\t because\t someone\t said that it hardens tooth enamel.

Why try to re-invent the wheel when thousands of other people have already used citric acid and the results are recorded? You will not know if you are getting what I say you should get if you are using something different than what I suggest. You would be setting up a whole new program of research. Will you be able to check it out on thousands of people like I have? If not, then your research will be lacking in authenticity. If you want to use a new acid, don’t let me stop you, but be prepared to get different results and have people wondering what your MMS really is. In fact, now that I think about it: •\t If you do use an acid other than citric acid, you should add somewhere, if you are selling it, “not approved by Jim Humble”. Anybody buying it from you should know that I am not approving other acids. If I did, we would soon have dozens of different mixtures. It would wind up being a hodgepodge of MMSs being sold. So that is the answer to different acids. There are dozens that will work but thousands of people have already used citric acid success- fully, so why not join them? Don’t try to re-invent the wheel. How to Mix Citric Acid To use citric acid, obtain it in dry form as citric acid crystals. Some health food stores carry them, or you can order them from a pharmacy or buy them from a large grocery store. Large stores usually carry citric acid in the baking soda area.

I no longer suggest using 10% mixtures as the 50% mixture is so much easier to use. But I have no objections as it still generates the same chlorine dioxide . Since there has been some confusion about mixing the citric acid solution, let me clarify my instructions a bit. When you use 9 measures of water to one measure of citric acid crystals you get a 10% solution, but that is not a 10 to 1 mixture, as some have thought. That is a 9 to 1 mixture. But it gives you 10 parts—9 parts water plus one part acid equals 10 parts total, which make up a 10% solution of citric acid. To Make a 50% Solution Pack a cup or small bowl with citric acid powder (crystals), tamping it\t down\tto\t fill\t air\t holes.\t Dump\t it\t in\t a\t larger\t bowl.\t Then\t fill\t the\t same\t cup\t or\t small\t bowl\t with\t distilled\t or\t purified\t water\t and\t dump\t that\t in\t the\t larger bowl. The citric acid powder weighs almost the same as water and is close enough for the purpose. Stir till dissolved. You will notice that the mixture becomes cold. Then pour it into a bottle(s) with a drip style top for counting drops and label it 50% citric acid. Use it for activating MMS at one drop for each drop of MMS. The best idea is to add some food coloring like the food coloring for cakes and other food purposes. This then keeps you from mistaking if you have citric or MMS in your glass. The food coloring in the citric will fade out when you add it to the MMS. But the coloring helps you know if what you spilled on the table is citric or MMS. Whichever strength of citric acid you make, always store it in a bottle with a lid. When using citric acid as an activator, be sure to keep in mind all of the other instructions concerning how to mix and take MMS. Making a Basic MMS Dose You can make your MMS doses in either of two ways: 1. Use a 50% solution of citric acid and add one drop of it for each drop of MMS.

A little too much lemon or lime juice or citric acid makes no difference at all. Just don’t use too little or you’ll have poor results. On the other hand, a little too much MMS can make you feel sick, so always count the drops of MMS carefully. Citrus Juice Information Lemon and lime juice work well as activators for MMS (sodium chlorite ), turning it into chlorine dioxide . Use 5 drops of juice for each drop of MMS. Lemon and lime are normally 10% citric acid. •\t However, orange juice does not work as an activator. Never try to activate your MMS with orange juice and never dilute your activated MMS with orange juice either. It stops the pathogen-killing action of MMS. Grapefruit juice also does not work as an activator. However, you can dilute your MMS dose with grapefruit juice to improve the taste, as it does not stop the pathogen-killing action. When you choose a juice to dilute your activated MMS (which improves\t its\t flavor),\t read\t the\t list\t of\t ingredients. \tIf\t vitamin\t C (also called ascorbic acid) is listed as an additive, do not use that juice. Why not? •\t Vitamin C is an antioxidant and will cancel out the oxidizing action of your MMS. However, some juice containers list the nutritional information and you’ll often see Vitamin C listed there as a percentage. But that is the natural vitamin C and it is listed in a percentage such as 6% or 15% or even as high as 60% or more. Those numbers refer to the percentage of total vitamin C required by the body each day that is in that juice. That is always the natural vitamin C and it does not affect the MMS action. It is only the added Vitamin C, used as a preserva - tive, that you should avoid and that is not listed as a percentage, just as an “ingredient”.

Use a black marking pen to mark it on the side every 4 ounces so that you will be able to drink 4 ounces of liquid each hour. It’s easy. Just drink the liquid down to the next black mark or pour it down by pouring 4 ounces into a glass to drink from. To your clean dry container, add 24 drops of MMS and 24 drops of 50% citric acid and mix and then wait 20 seconds. •\t If you need to take less than 3 drops an hour you would use less than 24 drops at this step. Now\t once\t you\t have\t waited\t the\t 20\t seconds,\t you\t can\t fill\t the\t container\t with water or some kind of juice to overcome the taste. You cannot use coffee, orange juice , or any kind of juice that has had vitamin C added, nor can you use any juice with the fruit pulp still in the juice. To be safe in the USA, you can use apple juice that does not have vitamin C added, or grape, pineapple, berry, or cranberry, or any of these juices that you make yourself. However, many juices will destroy the MMS and you will wind up with a drink that has no value. One way to be certain that your juice doesn’t destroy your MMS is to obtain chlorine test strips from a pool store. These strips also indicate chlorine dioxide (activated MMS) although it doesn’t say so on the package, and they will tell you right away if your juice is killing the MMS or not. If you buy a package of strips you can use sharp scissors to cut the strips lengthwise down the middle to double the number of strips you have. It is always nice to have strips to just check for sure that you actually have chlorine dioxide. In third world countries, it is almost an absolute necessity to make your own juice as almost all juices bought in a store contain some sort of chemical that destroys MMS and makes it useless. You may find\t a\t juice\t that\t will\t work,\t but\t I\t suggest\t chlorine\t strips\t to\t check\t that\t it is not destroying your MMS. How to Use Gel Capsules You can overcome the bad taste of chlorine dioxide by diluting your dose with juice as described above; or you can do it by taking your MMS in capsules. For a chart summarizing how to do the capsule"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"50 General Procedural Information calculations, see Use of Gel Capsules Sizes 0 and 00 later in this chapter. Step One: Making up a Capsule First make up a 50% solution of citric acid as described above. For this method, you must use 50% one-to-one drops of citric and MMS . Capsules are too small to take the 5 drops of 10% citric acid required for each drop of MMS. Obtain a wine glass with a dimple in the bottom. Many such glasses do not have the dimple, but enough of them do that you will be able to\t find\t one.\t The\t dimple\t is\t to\t contain\t the\t few\t drops\t needed\t to\t make\t the MMS mixture. Obtain size zero gel capsules . Most people can swallow size zero or even size 00 with no trouble. After testing for many days, I have come to the conclusion that you don’t want to use more than 2 drops of MMS per capsule except in emergency situations, and in that case, you can use a larger capsule. •\t The reason for this is that you do not want 6 drops of highly concentrated MMS in your stomach at one time. The capsule may get up against your stomach lining and become painful or you will have vomiting , usually what they call projectile vomiting, because the stomach really doesn’t like that kind of thing. Step Two: Activate the MMS Put 1 or 2 drops of MMS in the dimple of the wine glass and since you are using 50% citric acid, you will only need one or two drops of the citric to activate the MMS. You will be using one-to-one citric and MMS. Once you add the citric, wait 20 seconds. It will turn dark brown (that’s the chlorine dioxide ). Step Three: Add Water If you are using 2 drops of MMS, add 8 drops of water and mix a bit. If you are using one drop of MMS, add 10 drops of water and mix a bit. That’s a total of 12 drops in both cases, counting MMS, citric acid, and water. Step Four: Fill the Capsule Suck the liquid out of the dimple using an eye dropper, carefully drop it into the gel capsule, and slip the lid on the capsule."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"51 General Procedural Information Then wash the capsule down with about one glass of water or juice or\t a\t little\t more\t at\t first.\t If\t you\t feel\t like\t vomiting , drink another glass of water or juice. You must take this gel capsule right away as it will soon dissolve. Swallow it quickly, as you do not want it to dissolve in your mouth. If you are using Protocol 2,000 and are taking more than 3 drops an hour, you would need to make a second capsule for the third drop. It would contain one drop of MMS activated with one drop of citric acid and 6 drops of water. See chart on next page. I have also determined that after several days, your system gets used to these capsules and you no longer feel like vomiting. Then you can go to 3 drops of MMS, 3 drops of citric and 4 drops of water. Making up your Day’s Supply of MMS Doses for Capsules Obtain a one-ounce dropper bottle, either plastic or glass. You can use an eye dropper bottle or a bottle with a dropper lid. The lid must be airtight. In a separate container, mix the number of MMS drops you will need for a day using the chart below with the heading “Make up\t drops\t for\t an\t 8\t hour\t day.”\t Once\t the\t drops\t are\t mixed,\t first\t wait\t the 20 seconds, then add the drops of water and then wait at least 5 more minutes before putting into the dropper bottle. The 5 minute wait\tis\tto\tmake\tsure\tall\treaction\thas\tfinished. Then during the day, use as many drops in your capsules as the chart indicates. You can use this technique to take any number of drops of MMS, as you can take two, three or more of the gel capsules. However, with Protocol 1,000 , one never needs more than three drops an hour. For extreme cases of cancer and other life-threatening diseases, you can use a size 00 gel capsule to take up to 4 drops of MMS and 4 drops of citric. When you get to the point of adding water drops, use as much water as the capsule will hold. The chart below tells you how many drops to use in the capsule. Remember: never mix the MMS and citric acid in the capsule itself. It must be mixed before it gets to the capsule. Capsules often explode or pop open if the MMS is mixed in the capsule.

Choosing Your Bottles A four-ounce bottle of MMS will last you a year or more when taken at about 6 drops each day (see the General Maintenance Protocol in Chapter 13). That means it should be stored in a bottle that does not leach chemicals into its contents.

They will withstand both high and low temperatures. You can buy them in many places on the internet, in all shapes and sizes, and they are not expensive. Milk and distilled water usually come in HDPE jugs. If you are making MMS for treating others and will be storing the supplies, try to obtain HDPE, number 2 bottles. If you cannot obtain them, get number 1 instead, the PET containers. For our own use in the Dominican Republic, and for class supplies, we have used number 2 bottles. However, while they are sturdy for citric acid, we have found that some of them crack after they have contained MMS for several weeks. We would be glad to hear from anyone using number 2 bottles, as to whether they have performed well or have had any problems.

If you are only going to take one dose of MMS, it is best to take it just before going to bed. MMS works very fast, and the body starts healing very fast. People often become sleepy after taking a dose of MMS, which simply means that the body is beginning to heal. It is well known that most healing is done during sleep. If you get sleepy after a dose of MMS it is a very good sign, so take a nap if you can. You will probably feel much better when you awaken. Also, if you take MMS twice a day, take one of the doses in the evening before going to bed. However, if you feel a cold coming on in the morning or in the afternoon, do not wait until bedtime to take a dose. Take a dose anytime you feel that you might be coming down with something. Treating Children It is perfectly safe to have children and babies take MMS. Of course, they must take fewer drops than adults. •\t The formula for babies is half a drop per hour. As always, use either 5 drops of 10% citric acid activator for each drop of MMS, or one drop of 50% citric acid. For children other than babies, use one drop of MMS for each 25 pounds (11.4 kg) of body weight per hour as the maximum dose, but"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"55 General Procedural Information start with one drop per hour. The protocol for children is essentially the same as for adults but uses smaller amounts. If the child is very sick, start at half a drop or less per hour. To make a half-drop dose, make a one-drop dose and pour out half before giving it to the child. Then increase from 1 to 2 or 3 drops as directed in Protocol 1000 , but: •\t Do not go beyond one drop for each 25 pounds (11.4 kg) of body weight per hour. Do not increase the dosage to more than half a drop for a baby per hour. If the baby or child becomes nauseous, make the doses smaller. Give smaller doses until the baby or child can tolerate more, but do not stop administering doses except in cases of extreme nausea or diarrhea. In those cases, wait until the diarrhea or nausea has passed before continuing with smaller doses. Dosage For Overweight People If you are overweight ,\t start\t with\t 2\t drops\t for\t the\t first\t dose\t and\t work\t up to 3 drops plus one drop for each 25 pounds of body weight over 175\t pounds.\t Overweight\t people\t have\t more\t trouble\t overcoming\t flu\t and other diseases, as the pathogens hide in fat tissue.

About Cancer Protocol 2000 After talking to about four thousand people on the phone, over 10,000 by email (and my secretary has talked to an additional 10,000), and after treating several thousand in person, I have now determined that hourly doses of MMS are the most effective for cancer and most diseases. So this is our cancer protocol and it also works for most other life threatening diseases. I can only give you my opinion because most of my data comes over the phone from people taking MMS at our suggestion. My opinion is that much more than 90% of those people whose life has been threatened by cancer and who have taken MMS as given here have overcome their cancer and are back living their lives. The most effective treatment we have against cancer is probably the procedure using Protocol 2000 and Protocol 3000 (which uses DMSO and MMS on the skin -- see heading below). Regardless of the treatment you use, never stop taking MMS until you are well. Also, we have had wonderful results since we have added the new"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"58 MMS Protocols MMS2 described in Chapter 16. So Protocol 2000 now includes MMS2. It is quite similar to the HIV/AIDS protocol that I have recently used to treat over 800 HIV/AIDS victims with 99% good results (all the associated diseases gone and all symptoms of the disease gone.) See Chapter 27 for more details. However, there is no medical test that can prove that HIV is negative. There will always be antibodies produced by the immune system that modern medicine claims are antibodies to the HIV virus. But these people were well, with lots of energy, most were back to work and back to their family and their lives. They were happy and I was happy with their condition. Many of them went to the local hospital for health determination and it was always positive. Please see Protocol 2000 at the end of this chapter. Important Reminders •\t Never use MMS without the addition of lemon, lime, or citric acid. In an emergency when you don’t have one of these, use vinegar. •\t When you dilute the activated MMS, use apple, grape, cranberry, or pineapple juice without added vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid), or any other juice, but do not use orange juice because it cancels out the MMS. •\t Natural vitamin C in lemon juice and fruit juices is not active against MMS. The only natural juice that kills MMS is orange juice; and added vitamin C in any juice prevents the MMS from being activated properly. Clara’s 6 and 6 Protocol The health of your mouth is extremely important. Please see “Daily Dental Care” in Chapter 14. If you are serious about getting well, you must follow the guidelines given there. Clara’s 6 and 6 protocol is for people who have chronic pain, the flu,\t a\t cold,\t pneumonia,\t or\t other\t diseases\t that\t are\t not\t generally\t considered incurable. When people are very sick and in bed they should use Protocol 1000 detailed later in this chapter and should start with a tiny dose. I’ve named this new protocol Clara’s Protocol because Clara Beltrones,\t a\t school\t teacher\t in\t Mexico,\t was\t the\t first\t to\t really\t apply\t it\t consistently. If you read the last chapter in the second edition of the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"59 MMS Protocols book The Miracle Mineral Solution of the 21 st Century you may recall that there were a number of success stories involving Clara treating people\t in\t her\t home.\t After\t that,\t I\t rented\t an\t office\t from\t Clara\t and\t her\t mother and I saw quite a few more people come in. Generally, Clara gives each person a 6-drop dose, has them wait one hour, and then has them mix the second dose, to make sure they understand how to do it right. Then she has them wait a few minutes or up to an hour before they leave. A Success Story A woman about 65 years old arrived at Clara’s house with her husband to buy some MMS. Both her right hand and her right foot were completely paralyzed . She came in with a walker, but was unable to hold onto it, so her husband had to help her hold it and it was a chore getting in the door. Clara gave her a 6-drop dose with 30 drops of 10% citric acid as the activator . She waited the 3 minutes, as always, and then added half a glass of water and handed it to the woman. With\t some\t difficulty,\t the\t woman\t lifted the glass to her mouth with her left hand. Her sciatica (lower back pain) was causing her discomfort, which made this small task a challenge. However, within 40 minutes she felt the pain in her back beginning to ease and some tingling in her right hand. In 60 minutes she could wiggle several fingers\t a\t bit.\t Clara\t handed\t her\t another 6-drop dose . As we waited for the second hour to pass, Clara called me in from the office.\t The\t lady\t was\t exercising\t her\t hand. She had complete mobility in her hand and she had taken off her shoe to exercise her toes. In fact, she was exercising her entire foot and could now move her toes and other muscles better than most people I know. When she left, she was still using the walker, but her husband didn’t have to help her and her lower back pain was gone. I could see that she would"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"60 MMS Protocols be walking without that walker in a few days. Results like these are not unusual. It happens all the time around here. This was written in 2008. How to Use Clara’s 6 and 6 Protocol The following is Clara’s 6 and 6 Protocol using MMS. It is simple and is\t intended\t for\t most\t conditions,\t such\t as\t the\t flu;\t colds;\t physical\t pains,\t either immediate or chronic; and most other general illnesses, but not incurable diseases, or really severe diseases such as pneumonia , swine\t flu , cancer , HIV/AIDS, and other life threatening diseases. For those, use Protocol 1000 or 2000. Steps for Clara’s Protocol 1. Put 6 drops of MMS in a glass and add 30 drops of 10% citric acid solution or 30 drops of lemon or lime juice. Shake the glass to mix the acid and MMS and wait at least 3 minutes. If you happen to walk away and forget about the time, a little longer is OK—10 or 15 minutes—as the solution remains at about the same strength. ◊\t Alternatively, use a 50% citric acid solution, putting one drop for each drop of MMS. You then need to wait only 20 seconds before adding the water or juice. 1. Add about half a glass of water or juice to the solution and drink it. Be sure to use a juice that does not have added vitamin C(ascorbic acid). Use apple juice , grape juice, pineapple juice, or cranberry juice. 1. Wait one hour and repeat step one. Normally, the person will experience some relief within 2 hours of taking\t the\t first\t dose,\t especially\t if\t he\t takes\t the\t second\t dose.\t Of\t course, there is no guarantee. If the person does not experience relief, he should begin taking 3 drops an hour. If he is well he does not need to go further. Do not go beyond 3 drops an hour, but continue at least 8 hours a day until the person is well. Follow\t this\t process\t for\t the\t flu,\t bad\t colds,\t and\t any\t sickness\t that\t is\t not life threatening. If the sickness is life threatening or becomes life threatening, change immediately to Protocol 2000. Fifteen-drop doses are generally not used anymore. See Protocol"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"61 MMS Protocols 1000 and 2000 in this chapter. When the person is well, revert to a maintenance dose of 6 drops twice a week (for young people) or 4 to 6 drops a day for people over 60. Of course, the goal of all of this is to avoid being sick, so take 6 drops\t twice\t a\t week.\t If\t you\t feel\t the\t flu\t coming\t on,\t then\t do\t Clara’s\t 6\t and\t 6\t Protocol\t as\t described\t above.\t You\t will\t have\t the\t flu\t for\t no\t more\t than 12 to 24 hours, and usually less than 6 hours after taking your second\t dose;\t just\t never\t give\t the\t flu\t a\t chance.\t The\t best\t way\t to\t kill\t the\t flu\t is\t to\t take\t 2\t or\t 3\t drops\t every\t hour\t all\t day\t long\t until\t you\t know\t it is gone. Taking 6 drops twice a week keeps your immune system strong and the pathogens few in number. You probably remember from school that there are always pathogens in your body. The 6 drop dose keeps their numbers manageable. About Revising MMS Protocols Many of the older protocols are superseded by the MMS 1000 and MMS 2000 protocols. Many people have been working their MMS doses up high. My recommendations were usually no more than 15 drops up to 3 times a day, but many people were taking much higher doses than that. •\t I now recommend no more than 3-drop doses for many diseases but on an hourly basis at least 8 hours a day for either 3 weeks or until well, which is usually less than 3 weeks. See Protocol 1000. There is beginning to be literature with dozens of different consider - ations concerning MMS and often the considerations are useful and quite logical. Let me make several comments here so that you can understand the new protocols better. Adding Antioxidants to Your Protocol? Many writers nowadays recommend that antioxidants be added to MMS to prevent damage in body cells. This is not necessary, as MMS is an extremely weak oxidizer and cannot harm the body cells However, there is no harm in adding various antioxidants at least 2 hours separated from any MMS dose. The ability to do damage in the body by oxidation depends upon the oxidizer’s oxidation potential , which is hundreds of millivolts less for chlorine dioxide than for oxygen , and more than a thousand millivolts less than for ozone . One other point to keep in mind that has been missed by the writers"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"62 MMS Protocols is that the oxidation potential of MMS (chlorine dioxide ) is positive 0.95 volts. The cells of the various tissues and organs of the body are also positive. Positive charges repel one another, making them unlikely to affect each another, but not impossible. Because there is such a large difference in the positive charges (chlorine dioxide is positive 0.95 and body cells are mostly positive 0.09 volts), there is a point where chlorine dioxide can overcome the weak charge of the body cell. This does not appear to happen often. In over 70,000 emails from around the world and at least 10,000 phone calls for every reason possible, no one has ever mentioned noticing problems from not adding antioxidants to their MMS protocol. Again, let me stress: •\t High doses of MMS are normally no longer needed. It isn’t large amounts of MMS that kill the viruses and other micro- organisms, but rather the longer time that MMS is present in the body. Viruses are killed because the MMS prevents the formation of special proteins in the virus. This means basically that the virus cannot grow and over a period of time, it is destroyed. In the past, large doses of MMS helped the MMS remain present in the body for a while longer than small doses, but that wasn’t good enough. Small doses on an hourly basis for 8 hours keep the MMS present in the body continuously for 9 hours. This is evidently what kills the virus and bacteria , yeast, fungus, and other harmful micro- organisms. So far, more than 800 HIV cases have been successfully treated with fewer than 5 failures noted -- also, I should mention, cancer cases and numerous other diseases were among this group. The New MMS Protocol 1000 This is it: The new HIV/AIDS and Other Disease Protocol MMS-1000: Please see Chapter 12 for methods of making doses of MMS for use 8 hours a day and for overcoming the bad taste. •\t Take 3 drops of activated MMS in juice or water once each hour for at least 8 consecutive hours every day for 3 weeks. •\t Normally it is best to start by taking only one or two drops an hour\tfor\tthe\tfirst\tseveral\thours. •\t For a very sick person, it is best to start out with a half drop an hour\tfor\tthe\tfirst\tseveral\thours."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"63 MMS Protocols •\t Increase the number of drops per hour as the person is able to tolerate more drops but never go more than 3 drops an hour. •\t If vomiting or diarrhea seem extra bad, stop hourly doses until they are over and then start back, but at a reduced dose. •\t In case of nausea immediately reduce the dose but do not stop taking MMS unless the nausea is severe. You can make your MMS doses in either of two ways and be sure to do it in a clean, dry cup or glass: 1. Use a 50% solution of citric acid and add one drop of it for each drop of MMS. Swirl it a little, wait 20 seconds, add a half cup of water or juice (with no added vitamin C but natural vitamin C is OK), and drink it. 1.

Do not use orange juice , but most other juices are OK, as long as they have no added Vitamin C. Orange juice and added Vitamin C prevent the MMS action. See Chapter 12, General Procedural Information . If you don’t have juice or would rather not use juice, instead use a full glass of water (8 ounces). Then you may not notice the taste. Dealing With Nausea etc. If you notice nausea , vomiting, diarrhea , or severe tiredness, drink a glass of water or take a teaspoon of baking soda or Alka Seltzer. If that doesn’t help, stop until the problem is gone, and then continue with less MMS for a few hours. But return to 3 drops an hour as soon as you can. Only stop in the case of severe nausea until the nausea or other problem is gone and then continue at a smaller dose. •\t These reactions in the body are indications that MMS is working, but that you have taken more than your body can comfortably handle.

Long before the 3 weeks are over, the person is healthy again. All the tests for HIV have been designed to test for HIV positive. The tests detect antibodies to the HIV virus or antigens. Antigens are substances that cause the immune system to generate antibodies. Unfortunately, both antibodies and antigens will be with you long after the HIV virus is gone, maybe for the rest of your life. That’s the immune system’s job, to protect you from the disease, or from the disease coming back, by keeping antibodies available. So the present tests for HIV positive will never work for testing HIV negative. OK, so what is a successfully treated HIV person? Well here in Africa we have now come to consider that it is any HIV/AIDS case that has lost all the various discomforts and symptoms and poor health that a person with AIDS has. In other words, here in Africa, when he is healthy and active again, we consider that his treatment has been successful."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"65 MMS Protocols The CD4 Count One other test that we apply, even though most doctors will say they don’t know what it means, is the CD4 count. Any doctor has to admit that\t the\t CD4\t count\t going\tup\t is\t a\t good\t significant\t indicator.\t It\t is\t a\t test\t of the white blood cells that the immune system uses to kill diseases and other things and the theory is that it is low when the HIV virus is present. But that is only a theory. The reason why doctors say they don’t know what it means that the CD4 count goes up is that they do not believe it to be possible that the HIV virus is gone. If the CD4 count is back up to normal or going up to normal, we consider that a very good indication. The normal range is between 400 and 1000. That is a measurement of white blood cells . •\t A person on the HIV/AIDS MMS protocol will have a 200 to 400 point increase in CD4 count in 3 to 4 weeks. In my opinion at this time, anyone who has a 200 to 400 increase in CD4 count is HIV and AIDS free -- otherwise why is the CD4 count going up so far? Anyway a person with a 400 CD4 count or less is considered to have HIV and a person who has less than 100 CD4 count is considered to have AIDS. In the U.S., they consider that you have AIDS when the white blood count is 200 or less. (There are reasons that they consider it 200 in the US and 100 in Africa, and I think it is because the sooner you are considered to have AIDS, the sooner it is legal to sell you AIDS ARV drugs. The drug companies claim that ARV drugs can increase the CD4 count as much as 25 points a year, but they haven’t shown any such records\tproving\tit,\tthat\tI\tcan\tfind.\t So\t in\t my\t opinion,\t when\t someone\t finishes\t this\t latest\t HIV\t protocol,\t I\t believe that he really is HIV/AIDS negative. So far the people here who\t have\t finished\t this\t protocol\t have\t remained\t healthy\t for\t up\t to\t 4\t months (till now). Someday, there will be a test to prove HIV negative, but there is no such test now. And appalling as it sounds, there are many false HIV positive tests reported, causing people distress, wasted money and lost time when it is not necessary, and of course the drug companies could care less, as they just make extra money selling the ARV drugs that people take if they are considered to be HIV positive. As long as we cannot prove HIV negative, the people who believe doctors will continue to take the poisonous ARV drugs. And of course, everyone in Africa believes doctors."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"66 MMS Protocols All the people treated with this protocol here are happy to be over their bad health and suffering and back to their normal lives. On their health sheet under “Other Data,” they all write, “Happy.” They are not worried about HIV any more as they feel that should their health deteriorate, they will just take some more MMS. In all the cases so far there have been no failures. They just get well. Why would I fool you? I don’t sell MMS. Although the HIV protocol is a bit intense and takes three weeks, it is quite simple. It uses only MMS which is now called MMS1. Out of the entire group, only 3 needed MMS2 because they had cancer , and that was handled too. Opportunistic Diseases Normally, HIV positive people have what are called opportunistic diseases that take over or get started because of the distressed immune system .\t Evidently\t the\t first\t thing\t MMS\t does\t is\t to\t go\t after\t those diseases. This strengthens the immune system which can then gear up and kill pathogens throughout the body. The reason why hourly doses are required is that HIV is a virus -- or maybe not. I know there are theories that HIV doesn’t exist and that AIDS doesn’t come from HIV. And the fact is, about 50% of people who have AIDS never were diagnosed with HIV . Fortunately, MMS doesn’t care one bit either way. It just does its job. It has been demonstrated that killing viruses takes longer than killing bacteria . It evidently takes more than 1 or 2 hours. How much longer I am not sure, but the 3 drops hourly for 8 hours per day for 3 weeks seems to work. All I know is that MMS overcomes AIDS and either it kills HIV or it just kills all the diseases that are present. I believe that something more than just bad nutrition is responsible for all those opportunistic diseases that seem to occur. They may be caused by the ARV drugs that are given to most patients. The ARVs certainly don’t do anything to prevent the opportunistic diseases or aid in their treatment. That is announced on the side of each ARV drug box. However, the ARV drugs that most HIV/AIDS patients are using also do not seem to prevent MMS from working. The people get well and I consider that amazing, as these drugs are the most poisonous thing a person can take that does not kill him immediately. So the thing to do is get people to stop taking the ARVs. But that can"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"67 MMS Protocols be dangerous in some cases, as ARVs are not something you can fool\t with\t much.\t It\t would\t be\t best\t to\t wait\t until\t they\t have\t finished\t the\t HIV protocol or until they have been taking MMS for 4 or 5 days. At that time, they can easily stop the ARV drugs. ARV drugs are killing a lot more people than HIV. Please see Chapter 22 for more on ARVs and some more amazing things about HIV. MMS works very quickly. How many people do you see tossing off their diseases and health problems in 3 weeks? Not many. In Protocol 1000, there is no need to use DMSO or MMS2 unless some unusual problem is present or comes to light.

Just don’t take too much MMS -- remember the rules. If MMS makes you feel worse: •\t It is working, but you are taking too much. You must decrease your doses. If you try to tough it out and continue taking too much, it can kill you. Decrease your dose to one drop an hour and if you are already taking a drop an hour and it is still making you feel worse, reduce to half a drop an hour or a quarter, or an eighth. But: •\t Do\t not\t stop\t taking\t MMS,\t especially\tif\t you\t have\t the\t swine\t flu.\t It is OK to stop for an hour or several hours if the MMS did indeed make you feel worse.

If necessary, reduce all the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"68 MMS Protocols way to an eighth of a drop per hour. But increase the dose as soon as possible. As I already said, add MMS2 if you are not improving. For more about MMS2, please see Chapter 16. For overcoming the MMS Bad Taste Using Gelatin Capsules, see Chapter 12. Protocol 2000 For All Cancers, Stage IV Cancer, and Other Immediately Life-Threatening Diseases Depending on how bad you feel, start with 1, 2 or 3 drops of MMS every hour for at least 8 hours a day. The worse you feel, the fewer drops you should take. This is an intense program that often works on cancer at any stage, and has worked for Stage IV cancers. It is the best I know at this time for advanced cancers. I have used it quite a few times on people here in Africa and also for two years in Mexico. It could be used with many other diseases as well. We have successfully treated most known life-threatening diseases in the last stages with this protocol. Hepatitis \tA,\t B,\t and\t C\t are\t examples\t and\t the\t final\t result\t was\t a\t negative\t reading.\t Please\t read\t about\t Protocol\t 1000\t first\t for\t the\t basic\t technical\t data you will need. Never give up on a person. Even if they have 2 hours left to live, get them started. Get some MMS1 into them. Up to this point, MMS is the opposite of drugs. Hundreds of thousands of people die taking drugs and everybody thinks that it is normal. “Well,” the doctor will say, “we were trying.” Think of this – over the past ten years, there has only been one death reported of someone taking MMS and that person was just not in good enough shape to be helped, even by MMS. Now millions of people have at least tried MMS and most of the millions were sick from something, else there would be no point in their trying it. •\t No deaths have been reported. In the 100,000 malaria cases treated by MMS, there were no deaths. Normally there would have been from 400 to 500 deaths in that number of malaria cases. Step One of Two Begin by taking a one-drop dose of MMS. Do this each hour for several hours until it appears that one drop is tolerated OK. Just add"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"69 MMS Protocols one drop of MMS to an empty dry glass and then a drop of 50% citric acid. Be sure to wait for at least 20 seconds before adding juice or water and drinking it. See Making a Basic MMS Dose in Chapter 12. You can use up to a full glass of water or juice to overcome most of the bad taste. Do this every hour for 10 hours straight each day. However, one drop is not enough. That is just to get you started. Once you determine that you can tolerate that one drop, go to two drops each hour. You don’t have to wait a whole day to go to two drops. If there is no nausea \t in\t the\t first\t two\t hours,\t go\t ahead\t and\t try\t two drops an hour. Two drops are activated with 10 drops of lemon or 10% citric or two drops of 50% citric. •\t The one juice you must not use is orange juice . And forego use of vitamin C while on the 2000 protocol. Both orange juice and vitamin C prevent the action of MMS. If you add juice to improve\tthe\tflavor,\tuse\tonly\tjuices\twith\tno\tadded\tVitamin\tC. •\t You can wait until two hours after completing the protocol for the day and then take your vitamin C. •\t If you become sicker than you already are, stop taking MMS until the increased portion of the sickness is gone and start back with a smaller dose. You can increase to 8 or even 10 drops of MMS1 each hour. However that is a lot, and most people will become nauseous and not tolerate that much until the cancer or other disease is completely gone. If you do go this high, place the activated mix in at least three quarters of a glass of water or juice or a full glass (8 ounces). That way you may be able to tolerate the taste a little more than if you used less water or juice and thus had a more concentrated mix. Step Two of Two Now the next step is a little hard for some people, but if you want a good result, it is needed. You must take MMS2 capsules at least twice\ta\tday\tat\tfirst\tand\tthen\tincrease\tto\t5\ttimes\ta\tday.\t Start slowly, as with everything. MMS2 is hypochlorous acid, the same acid that the human immune system uses to kill things. It has the smell of chlorine , but it is not chlorine -- it is just made with chlorine like table salt. Although it tastes a little worse than table salt, it has approximately the same poison index .

He ships them right out and you usually get them in less than a week. The immune system simply cannot make enough of this chemical to kill a cancer, but you can supplement it with these capsules . It’s the very same thing your immune system makes. This acid is generated by the chemical called calcium hypochlorite when you buy it.

However, I am the only one who suggests that you take it by mouth. I have been taking it for 4 years, and hundreds of people I sent it to in the beginning have taken it as well and now thousands have bought it from a supplier or made their own. (No, I never did charge for it. I mention this because so many critics keep saying I am making millions.) Actually it is perfectly logical to take it. Your system uses it extensively throughout the body to kill pathogens and the human body has been using it for hundreds of thousands of years. It would seem perfectly logical to assume that the system might need some if a disease is not being destroyed. Only people who sell drugs would want you to not take it, because it will heal you and you won’t need their ineffective drugs.

Killing the cancer too quickly can kill you too, so go slowly. You must take as much as you can without developing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or severe fatigue. Please see Chapter 15: Signs That MMS is Working . It is a balancing act. Increase your doses until you notice some slight indication that nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe fatigue, or all four are beginning to show up. If you know nausea is coming on, just reduce the next dose by about half. If nausea still hits, then stop the intake of MMS1 and 2 until the nausea passes, and start again immediately, but reduce the dose of both MMS1 and 2. You should notice the cancer getting better (smaller or less pain) very soon, or maybe you’ll just notice it not getting worse. However, do not remain taking a reduced dosage. After several hours of taking a reduced dose that does not make you feel worse, begin slowly increasing again. Soon you will get the hang of the balancing act of taking as much as possible but not letting it make you feel sicker.

A few people have been successful in using Protocol 3000 on their cancer, and nothing else, as it is a very powerful protocol and it can kill many diseases. But normally one will need both Protocols 2000 and 3000. However, the same rules apply. •\t Do not make yourself feel worse and if you do, reduce your intake of MMS 1 and 2. The minute you feel that nausea is starting, or something else is feeling bad, reduce your dosage or at least do not increase. This goes for both MMS1 and 2. With MMS2 you can reduce the dosage by opening the capsule and dumping part of the powder out. Generally, once you are taking a full capsule, you would increase the dose merely by just taking more capsules in a day. Maintain the two-hour separation, but you can take it more often if it doesn’t make you feel sicker. Don’t take more than one capsule at one time.

Protocol 3000: Using DMSO to Treat Life-Threatening Diseases The goal with life-threatening situations is to quickly get MMS circulating in the blood while trying to stay under the nausea level. One way to achieve this is by adding DMSO to activated MMS, so that it can act as a carrier for sending MMS directly into the skin and muscles and thus into the blood. Experience and testing have proven that DMSO is carried directly to any cancer in the body and it then penetrates the cancer cells. This is not speculation; it has been proven through testing. The theory is that when DMSO is carrying MMS, it will take it into the cancerous cells, thereby killing the virus that makes the cells cancerous. Many cancers have been healed in this way, and I hear about it since many people have phoned me stating that their cancer is gone. •\t When using this treatment, always also take MMS by mouth, as in Protocol 1000 or 2000 . Clara Beltrones in Mexico has used Protocol 3000 quite extensively and she helped to develop it. Along with Protocol 2000, she has used it with many cancers. ALLERGY WARNING: A very few people are allergic to DMSO or have\t very\t weak\t livers\t and\t can\t experience\t significant\t problems\t with\t DMSO. To test whether or not you are allergic to it, perform this test: •\t Carefully wash and dry your arm; •\t Add one drop of DMSO to one spot on your arm and rub it in; •\t Give it about 15 minutes to soak in and then wait several hours. If there is no pain in your liver area, it is probably safe for you to use DMSO, which will be the case for 99 out of 100 people. However, to be safe, wait 24 hours to make sure you have no reaction to the DMSO. If you do have a bad reaction to DMSO, you need to work on improving your liver.

The MMS/DMSO treatment described below is an accelerated skin technique that pushes MMS into the blood plasma. In the case of cancer it should be used in addition to a normal oral regimen of MMS. DMSO Procedure Steps 1. Step1: Make an MMS solution by activating 10 drops of MMS with 10 drops of 50% citric acid or 50 drops of 10% citric acid. Wait 20 seconds for the 50% citric to activate or 3 minutes for the 10% citric to activate.

You could get rubber into your body as the DMSO melts the rubber. ◊\t If you notice a burning sensation, the best technique is to place a teaspoon of water on the burning area and rub it in. Keep that up until it is no longer burning . Or use a spray bottle with just water in it for such problems. ◊\t You can rub olive oil and aloe vera juice on the skin after the DMSO application.

It\t is\t not\t true\t that\t MMS\t creates\t any\t deficiencies\t in\t the\t human\t body.\t There have been a very few people claiming that, but they offer no more\t than\t one\t or\t two\t deficiencies\t at\t the\t maximum\t as\t examples.\t Certainly there is no laboratory evidence.

The evidence from people calling and emailing in over 70,000 emails and calls is that the longer people take MMS, the fewer health problems they have. The\t evidence\t strongly\t suggests\t that\t when\t the\t body\t is\t detoxified\t and\t the pathogens are all killed, the body will often generate necessary nutrition if it is not available. Those people in Africa all became healthy after overcoming their HIV without changing their daily food. Certainly there are not many places where the food is less nutritious than the area that I was in and yet they became healthy. But wait, there is a lot more to the maintenance procedure than just taking a few drops each day. It also includes brushing your teeth and cleaning your sinuses and lungs (see next section). A friend of mine developed this procedure and I have been using it with much success.\t Even\t though\t I\t was\t taking\t MMS\t orally,\t I\t did\t catch\t the\t flu\t and\t colds\t from\t time\t to\t time\t and\t I\t did\t get\t the\t swine\t flu . The dental and respiratory procedure would have prevented all that. Sorry I cannot tell you my friend’s name, because he does not want to be known. Daily Procedure For Dental, Respiratory and General Health There are three steps in this short procedure. Each morning, make up a 2-drop dose in a clean dry cup. Activate it with either 10 drops of 10% citric acid and wait 3 minutes or with 2 drops of 50% citric acid"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"76 MMS Protocols and wait 20 seconds. •\t Never use more than 2 drops of MMS1 for this maintenance procedure. Don’t add any water or juice yet. Two drops will give you a small amount of chlorine dioxide fumes in the air in the cup. Step One: Briefly Breathe the Fumes Put your nose over the brim of the cup and breath in slowly once . That’s all. See next paragraph. Then put your mouth over the cup and breathe in once slowly and deeply. Do this very gently and carefully\tat\tfirst.\t Take\ta\tcouple\tof\tweeks\tto\tget\tused\tto\tit.\t Caution: This can be dangerous if you overdo it. You must be very careful. When you breathe in, if you feel a slight bite, you just got too much chlorine dioxide . A tiny bite won’t hurt you -- it tells you it is reacting with your tissues. •\t Remember, anything in too strong a quantity can hurt you. Just one half cup of table salt would kill you. This procedure is safe if you follow instructions. Keep in mind that: •\t Lung damage happens without your knowledge as there are no pain nerves in your lungs. Damage your lungs and in about 4 hours you will be gasping for breath. So when you do this procedure, use only a 2-drop dose in the cup and breathe only two breaths. You will barely smell the chlorine dioxide and one tiny bite won’t hurt you, but no more. Same when you breathe it with your mouth deeply. A tiny bite in your lungs may be\t too\t much,\t and\t since\t you\t won’t\t feel\t it,\t breathe\t less\t deeply\t at\t first.\t But a 2-drop dose is not going to kill you. \t Never use more than 2 drops for this procedure.

The MMS does not hurt or harm lungs, but you can easily overdo anything. Coughing is always normal. But go slowly. Be careful. Once you have this down and working every day, you will notice the difference. So far, using this procedure,\t none\t of\t us\t has\t had\t a\t single\t thing\t such\t as\t a\t cold,\t flu,\t or\t pneumonia, and I can imagine that there are a lot of other things we haven’t had."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"77 MMS Protocols About Getting MMS to the Lungs Getting MMS to the lungs is not easy otherwise. When you take it by mouth, the chlorine dioxide has to enter the blood in the stomach, be\t carried\t around\t the\t body,\t and\t finally\t wind\t up\t in\t the\t lungs.\t But\t the blood must pick up oxygen in the lungs and it doesn’t get to the carbon dioxide side of the lungs except in tiny amounts. There is no reason for it to go there. The carbon dioxide simply gets breathed out. So the amount of chlorine dioxide available to kill pathogens that love the carbon dioxide side of the lungs is extremely limited. But when you breathe chlorine dioxide in, it goes straight into the lungs. It is probably hundreds of times more than would be carried there by the blood. So every morning, you are scrubbing your lungs a little bit cleaner with chlorine dioxide. Remember: •\t Never more than 2 drops of MMS 1; •\t Go gently and slowly; and •\t Take a total of one breath through your nose and one through your mouth. Step Two: Brush Teeth and Gums Add 3 tablespoons of water to the same 2 drops and stir a bit. Scoop out one tablespoon and put it on your tooth brush to brush your teeth, gums and tongue. Again, those people who say MMS is hard on tooth enamel do not know what they are talking about. In rare cases, it kills things that are on the enamel and that may look bad for a short while, but it does not harm the enamel itself. Step Three: Gargle Once your teeth are brushed with the one tablespoon of MMS solution, add about a quarter cup of water to the other two tablespoons of water that are still in the cup and gargle .

The fact is that MMS is a super pre- ventative of almost every disease known, because improving the immune system will always improve your resistance to diseases. After observing thousands of people who have taken MMS, and talking to people who have been taking it for different lengths of time up to 10 years, it is my opinion that the longer one has been taking MMS the fewer health problems he has and the healthier he appears to be. •\t MMS will prevent any disease the immune system can attack. Obviously, if MMS can destroy a cancer of most any size, it will also prevent a cancer from starting. In\t our\t research\t with\t a\t dark\t field\t microscope , we observed that white blood cells became much more active about two hours after a dose of MMS was taken. They moved through the blood much faster towards poisonous blood clots. We checked this many times. Certain white blood cells become much more active after one takes a dose of MMS. I don’t know, nor have I ever read, about the fact that white blood cells can accelerate their movement, but after a dose of MMS they in fact moved faster. They move by elongating themselves and then drawing their body in the direction of the elongation much the way earthworms move. We videoed it at the time, which was in 2006. They were able to determine the direction of clots in the blood and move towards them at more than double the normal rate. I would appreciate email letters from anyone noticing information about any aspect of MMS, either pro or con. Note: If you cannot afford health insurance ,\t you\t should\t definitely\t be taking MMS every day. In fact it is better than health insurance. If I were to buy health insurance it would only be accident health insurance against broken arms and that sort of thing. #####"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"79 Healing Diseases Healing Diseases I t is the body itself that heals any damage to itself. I am not suggesting that MMS does the healing. It just supplies the immune system with more of the same killer that it already manufacturers for the purpose of killing pathogens. With MMS, the immune\t system\t evidently \tbecomes\t at\t least\t 100\t times\t more\t efficient.\t Since we don’t have millions of dollars for research yet, there are many things that we must assume. There is nothing wrong with assuming things as long as it is working and thousands of people are getting well. Before I go any further, I would like to note that some of the important basic concepts concerning MMS are repeated a few times throughout this book. The reason for this is that people have a tendency to look up instructions or particular concepts and then go and use what they have read. They may not read the whole book. In fact, they usually do not. Hopefully, the information in this book has been repeated enough that you will get the key elements needed to use MMS safely and effectively. I try to repeat the important facts a couple of times in different ways, since 50,000 emails have taught me that most book readers often forget important facts. Please especially read Chapter 10, Safety Precautions and Chapter 11, General Procedural Information . And of course if you are going to use MMS you have to read Chapter 12 on protocols . But, of course, I encourage you to read this whole book. This chapter has been rewritten for this book. It was taken from the\t first\t book\t as\t it\t has\t important\t data\t that\t anyone\t learning\t about\t MMS should have. Mistakes have been corrected and data have been updated as we have learned new things from the thousands of people who have reported on their experiences. Please consider the data presented in this chapter to be the latest and most up to date. If there are any discrepancies between this book and other books, this book should take precedence as of January 1, 2011. In general, much new data has been added and important improvements have been added, and even better results have been observed over the past several years throughout the world. MMS is now sold on the Internet as water purification drops. It is\t the\t best\t water\t purification chemical known and is useful when you"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"80 Healing Diseases travel to foreign countries or anywhere in the U.S. where water puri- fication\t is\t necessary.\t Most\t MMS\t sold\t around\t the\t world\t is\t a\t solution\t of 22.4% sodium chlorite. However, all the sodium chlorite (MMS) solutions sold will do all the things described in this book with the exception that one may need to vary the number of drops for different solutions that might not be 22.4% sodium chlorite. •\t A level teaspoon of lime or lemon juice, or 10% citric acid solution, is about 80 drops; •\t A quarter of a teaspoon is 20 drops; •\t In Europe the teaspoons are about 50 drops. A little too much lemon or lime juice or citric acid makes no difference. Just don’t use too little or you’ll have poor results. On the other hand, a bit too much MMS can make you feel sick, so always count the drops carefully and always check the number of drops that your teaspoons\t hold.\t If\t you\t use\t a\t teaspoon,\t always\t fill\t it\t to\t the\t same\t level.\t The Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing uses the name Cleansing Water which is the same as MMS. It does not sell the cleansing water but rather it gives if free of charge. The Church depends on donations like any other church. You can now buy the 50% citric acid solution. However, you can make your own easily enough. Citric acid crystals are sold in many health food stores and many pharmacies in the U.S. Some places in the world, it is sold in 50 pound sacks for use in food processing. Even that is possible because the cost is low. It would be less than $50 USD anywhere. The 10% citric acid will not be discontinued, but the new acid mixture of 50% citric acid will be sold by some suppliers for those preferring to mix one drop of citric acid to one drop of MMS. Please see Chapter 12 for more on how to make citric acid. Keep in mind that anytime you change your container shape or top shape or hole in the top, different size drops will come out. So nothing is going to give you absolutely the same solution, but MMS was formulated with the idea that individual people could treat themselves. When you wind up with slightly different mixtures, the difference in body reaction is seldom noticed."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"81 Healing Diseases The Fundamentals of Using MMS It has been shown that the chemical generated by MMS does not remain in the body more than 1 to 1.5 hours, at most. The size of the dose does not seem to make a great deal of difference to the amount of time that MMS remains active in the body. This is because whether it is a large amount or small amount, it still breaks down into little more than table salt in an hour or two. This was shown in my personal laboratory tests when environments similar to the human digestive system were created. However, different tests have shown different results. So regardless of varying results, the fact is that using small doses over longer periods of time does make a very big difference in results. It has been demonstrated more than 1,000 times that small doses administered at frequent intervals, up to once an hour, are more effective than large doses administered once or twice a day. This is demonstrated in my own personal experience as my group in Mexico treated people, and as we recommended this method or treatment in our email answers to various questions. In reading the various methods for using MMS, keep in mind this fundamental rule, that it is going to be much more effective if you take it each hour. So always start out with a one-drop dose. That means that you activate each drop of MMS either with (a) 5 drops of citric acid, wait 3 minutes, and then add juice or water; or (b) use the 50-50 citric acid mixture and wait only 20 seconds. On\t the\t second\t dose,\t you\t can\t then\t increase\t to\t 2\t drops\t if\t the\t first\t drop didn’t cause nausea (in most cases it won’t). Generally, that will be\t one\t hour\t after\t taking\t the\t first\t dose.\t Keep\t increasing\t the\t dosage\t every hour until you have reached the maximum of 3 drops an hour. The only exception to this rule is if you are doing Protocol 2000 for a life-threatening disease. But in general, a 3-drop dose is what is needed. Nausea and diarrhea are both good indicators for an hour or two, but if they continue longer, they can do more harm than good. See Chapter 15, Signs That MMS is Working . Fundamental Rule Decrease the number of drops as needed to prevent nausea or diarrhea, but do not stop taking MMS unless the nausea or"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 Healing Diseases diarrhea is extreme. Follow these guidelines when using the various methods for taking MMS detailed in this book. Arteriosclerosis There are many causes for hardening and clogging of the arteries, but cholesterol seems to be the best known. To date, several people have reported that taking MMS reduced the clogging of their arteries due to cholesterol. One lady called to say that she was in very bad shape. She had been told that her veins were at least 80% clogged. The doctors couldn’t say if it was worse because they couldn’t measure more than that. She took large, 15-drop doses three times a day for 30 days, and when they measured again, the clogging was less than 50%. That is a tremendous change in just 30 days. While this is not much to go on, it does give you an idea of what MMS\t can\t do.\t Remember,\t we’re\t talking\t about\t a\t water\t purifier.\t Also,\t remember that 975,000 people die each year in the US as a result of using medical drugs. No one has died from using MMS. In fact, so far, with over 5 million having taken MMS, there is not a single report of anyone dying while taking MMS. Well, there is now one report of a person dying in Germany , but the person was beyond help and the cause wasn’t MMS. That’s different than the drug deaths where the death is listed as caused by the drug. The woman in Australia died after taking 2 drops of MMS, so her husband reported, but the autopsy was not done for months and then it was not published. But do you see? No deaths are attributed to MMS directly, and worldwide more than 1.5 million deaths are attributed to drugs. There is a great deal of evidence indicating that cholesterol deposits in the arteries and veins around the heart are not the cause of heart attacks. The evidence points out that the walls of these vessels, about 10 inches or so right at the heart, collapse 70 to 80 times every minute with each beat of the heart for our entire lives. The vessel walls are strengthened by vitamin C \t and\t a\t deficiency\t in\t vitamin\t C\t along with a couple of amino acids will cause them to weaken. When the blood vessel walls crack, they remain collapsed and this is when a heart attack happens. The cholesterol that medical"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"83 Healing Diseases people say is clogging the veins has really been deposited there to compensate\t for\t the\t deficiency\t of\t vitamin\t C.\t It\t is\t the\t body’s\t secondary\t defense, used to prevent the walls of the arteries and veins on the heart from collapsing. To avoid clogged arteries and veins, take 6 to 10 grams of vitamin C daily. Reduce the amount if you get diarrhea . Dr. Matthias Rath researched this data and wrote several books. Get his book, Why Animals Do Not Have Heart Attacks , and check the internet. The proof is solid, certainly 100 times better than any data supporting the idea that cholesterol drugs will reduce your chances of a heart attack. \t Keep in mind that Vitamin C is an antioxidant and will cancel out the oxidizing action of MMS A number of people have reported reducing the clogging of their arteries with MMS. There have not been any negative reports for this use. The body may be able to heal the arteries as quickly as the cholesterol is removed. Also, read Dr. Matthias Rath’s books. Two people have called to say that after starting MMS, they noticed heavy heart palpitations . Later, they called back to say that the pal- pitations were gone. In my opinion, the palpitations were probably an indication that bacteria that sometimes grow on the heart valves were killed. The palpitations may have been uncomfortable, but if left untreated, the bacteria could have killed the person at a later date. Arthritis There are some things you should know about arthritis if you have this problem. First, it doesn’t matter how bad it is, your body will heal it, but you have to follow the correct procedure. To do that, you need to know what kind of arthritis you have, as MMS will help with rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme arthritis, and most others, but although it may help with osteoarthritis , it may not completely overcome it. Osteoarthritis is caused by muscles in an area pulling in the wrong direction. The wrong muscles try to take over to move the body in that area. When all of these muscles begin to pull against one another, they create pain and tension in the area and begin to destroy the joint. However, you can get it to work again. The book, Pain Free, by Pete Egoscue explains how to get muscles working in a balanced way."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"84 Healing Diseases The body then heals the joint, no matter how badly the bones are currently scraping against one another. It just requires some unusual exercises and stretches to get the correct muscles to function properly again. In most cases, even in severe cases, the pain is gone in a week. So buy the book online or at any large book store. The paperback was $15 the last time I looked. Or in Germany the Feldenkrais Method works quite well. Most other forms of arthritis can be handled with MMS. Just use Protocol 1000. Lyme Arthritis Dr. Hesselink, the doctor who wrote Chapter 22 of the book The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21 st Century ,\t was\t the\t first\t to\t start\t using citric acid. While preparing his friend to go to Africa to use MMS there, he decided it would be best to give him bottles containing dry MMS powder (sodium chlorite ) and that once in Africa his friend could just add water to the bottles. He then decided to do the same with the lemon juice to be used as the activator . For this purpose, he bought citric acid powder, since that is the acid in lemons. Well, it worked\t fine.\t His\t friend\t made\t a\t big\t hit\t and\t helped\t many\t sick\t people\t get well. After his friend returned from Africa, Dr. Hesselink was sitting talking to one of his other friends who had Lyme Arthritis -- in fact, an extremely bad case of it. He suggested to this friend that he should mix a dose of MMS the way his other friend had mixed doses in Africa. The doses used in Africa contained 12 drops of MMS and 60 drops of citric acid solution. He did as Dr. Hesselink instructed and amazingly, the arthritis was gone the next morning, although he reported that it returned in about 6 weeks. Since then, he requires a dose every few weeks. This indicates, of course, that he is not taking the time to make sure that the arthritis is completely destroyed. Dr. Hesselink has used MMS and citric acid to kill Lyme Arthritis in several other people, so for some time, I have been recommending using citric acid, as that is the acid in lemon juice, and it is also working as well as vinegar . What really should be done for Lyme Arthritis is to follow Protocol 1000 for three weeks."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"85 Healing Diseases Asthma MMS has often stopped an asthma attack in 10 minutes or less, but it doesn’t work every time, and it works best to treat asthma if it is used over a longer period of time. Whether or not MMS will stop an attack instantly, and how long it takes to dispose of a case of asthma, depends on the condition of the asthma. Just follow the directions in Chapter 13 for Protocol 1000 except go very lightly. Start with a one-quarter drop per hour in bad cases and work up slowly. You should be OK. One lady called up and asked if MMS would help asthma. I said that I thought it would. She began taking MMS and her asthma got worse. She called me back and I told her that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better, but that she shouldn’t stop. Well, believe it or not, she continued taking the MMS for six weeks with the asthma remaining in a worsened condition, but she kept the faith. She\t continued\t taking\t MMS\t and\t refused\t to\t stop\t until\t finally\t it\t began\t to get better. It continued to get better until it was completely gone. The entire process only took 2 months. I don’t know what to say about that kind of faith, but it worked. We have found that most diseases can be overcome in several weeks by doing Protocol 1000. You can do the protocol in the evening after work\t if\t you\t were\t to\t take\t the\t first\t one\t or\t two\t doses\t towards\t the\t end\t of the work day. Start with one drop an hour and then increase to 3 drops an hour. Normally, you will not have to go over three drops an hour. Just keep it up until the asthma is gone. Borreliosis, Lyme Disease Borreliosis and Lyme are the same disease. It is known in Europe as Borreliosis and in the Americas as Lyme disease . In Europe, most people still consider that it is caused by a tick and in America, it is pretty well accepted that it comes from many different sources, although it probably was carried by a tick originally. The well-known story is that the disease was created in a government laboratory near the City of Lyme, New Hampshire. There was an explosion in the lab and the disease got spread to the local wild animals . The ticks then spread it throughout the wild community in the U.S. and people spread it to Europe. Anyway that is the story. The disease is an extremely disabling one that destroys various organs of the body and is very hard to cure. The immune system"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"86 Healing Diseases truly needs the help of MMS to overcome Lyme disease. The best results we have had so far have been experienced as follows and generally, you can overcome Lyme and be free of it for the rest of your life. It seems one needs as much MMS as possible. Do Protocol 2000 and 3000 and also use MMS in other ways, as given in Chapter 23, Methods Other Than Oral of Using MMS . If you are not improving, you are probably not taking enough MMS. There is no proof of that yet, but the information I have received back is that everyone who has Lyme and who is taking MMS is experienc - ing improvement. However, the indication is that one should take as much MMS as possible every hour without getting nauseous . The immune system needs that, and the baths and the MMS2. You can just follow Protocol 2000 and 3000 and maybe add baths to that. Do not give up; keep at it until you’re well. Cancer Including Leukemia The new cancer protocol given in Chapter 13, Protocol 2000, has now proven to be the most effective protocol as used with hundreds of people. Chlorine dioxide serves as the perfect ammunition with which the immune system can attack the microorganism causing the malignancy inside the cancer cells. We believe this theory has been proven, as many people with cancer have told us that their cancer went away or was greatly reduced after taking MMS; however, there is not yet enough research in this area. Still, the results reported with the use of MMS are a lot better than those reported with standard medical treatments. People have often told us, and we have noticed, that skin cancer usually dries up and drops off within one week. We do not claim that the MMS caused the effect, but we did observe this. Some cancers are harder to treat than others; if a cancer does not start to disappear within about 2 weeks of starting Protocol 2,000, one should also add Protocol 3000 and get some Indian herbs from a woman in Texas. You can see her address at the end of this chapter. •\t It’s important to read Protocol 2000 In Chapter 13 , as recently we have had almost 100% recovery using Protocol 2000. When one is working with cancer and it is not getting better, the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"87 Healing Diseases overruling concept is that you are not taking enough MMS -- however, it could be that you are taking too much. If you are feeling worse, that almost always indicates you are taking too much MMS. See the difference? Not getting better indicates not enough MMS. Feeling worse indicates too much MMS. The reason for feeling worse is you are killing the cancer too fast and the body cannot clear out the poisons fast enough. Summary of Protocol 2000 •\t Start in the morning with one drop hourly and if you experience too much nausea, diarrhea, or fatigue to tolerate, reduce the dose immediately to a half drop. Do this by making a one-drop dose but only drinking half of it. You might need to go down to a quarter-drop dose, or even stop taking MMS altogether until these reactions fade away. •\t When the nausea or other symptoms are gone, resume MMS doses at a level you think you can tolerate. Take them hourly for ten hours each day. •\t As you can, increase the dosage to 10 drops each hour. •\t Also take one MMS 2 capsule \t on\t alternate\t hours\t (filled\t according to your tolerance). Please see Chapter 16 for more about MMS 2 and Chapter 13 for the MMS protocols. Anytime you notice nausea or the other signs, decrease the number of drops in a dose. Then begin increasing them right away again. You can increase the dosage up to 10 drops every hour for 10 hours a day. Just take less if you notice nausea , but then continue to increase the dosage when the nausea goes away. Be sure you are using activated MMS. The secret is keeping activated MMS drops in the body continu - ously by taking a dose, however small, every hour. Keep at it until the cancer is gone, but also remember not to make the person sick with nausea or diarrhea . If this should happen, reduce the number of\t drops\t in\t the\t next\t dose.\t Also,\t find\t some\t way\t to\t check\t whether\t or\t not the cancer is getting better. See page 54 for information on the AMAS cancer test. We have also found that Protocol 3000 is also very effective to add to the cancer protocol."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"88 Healing Diseases Coxsackie Virus There are a number of viruses that might be considered exotic. They really aren’t, but unless you are a doctor , you won’t hear much about them. However you should, because they are abundantly present. The coxsackie B virus, according to much of the current medical literature, causes up to one third of reported heart attacks. It causes the\t heart\t to\t become\t inflamed\t and\t the\t heart\t doesn’t\t work\t very\t well\t when\t inflamed.\t It\t is\t also\t reported\t that\t this\t virus\t causes\t the\t pancreas\t to\tbecome\tinflamed,\tthus\tcausing\ttype\t1\tand\t2\tdiabetes . When MMS is taken, it provides the immune system with additional ammunition. Killing the coxsackie B virus could cause the heart to palpitate for a short while, so if you use MMS to treat this virus, go slowly and take small doses. If the heart does palpitate after a dose of MMS, that is a good sign. Just sit down and totally relax and normally it will stop in a couple of minutes. If it doesn’t stop, one might need a shock treatment at a hospital. This has never happened but I mention it here just so you will know what to do in such an unlikely event. Dental Conditions Daily Dental Care MMS can change the health of your mouth in one week. It is important to\t address\t this\t first,\t because\t dental\t health\t affects\t the\t health\t of\t your\t entire body. So when you begin taking MMS, make sure you treat your mouth. Of the thousands of people who have gotten better by taking MMS, the ones who have done the best are those who have made their mouths healthy, as that causes MMS to work more quickly. Make a ten-drop dose of MMS in a half glass of water. (See Making a Basic MMS Dose in Chapter 12 and Daily Procedure For Dental and Respiratory Health in Chapter 13.) Use this solution to brush your teeth. If you pour some of the liquid on your toothbrush, rather than dipping your toothbrush into it, you can use the same solution to brush your teeth and gums two or three times in one day, but you need a bottle with a lid, as the solution will lose strength without a lid. Be sure to brush your gums. Use a new solution every morning. The MMS will brighten and strengthen the enamel on your teeth. What really happens is that the MMS kills the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"89 Healing Diseases bacteria on the enamel that ordinarily do the damage. On very rare occasions, the MMS can kill bacteria that turn color as they die and the teeth can look bad for several weeks, but they clear up. Abscessed Teeth, Infected Gums, and Pyor - rhea When using MMS, expect a simple toothache to be gone immediately, and the pain of an abscessed tooth to be overcome in less than 4 hours. •\t Expect all infection and all pyorrhea to be gone in one week; •\t Expect all loose teeth to be rock solid in 2 weeks; •\t Expect a completely healthy mouth in less than 3 weeks. Keep in mind that the MMS solution is the most powerful killer of pathogens known. Once the pyorrhea and infections have been killed, the mouth will heal very quickly and you will only need to use MMS two or three times a week for maintenance. But follow the health suggestions above. There are exceptions, of course. For instance, MMS cannot work on an abscess located inside a tooth if it cannot reach the abscess through a hole or crack. In such a case, the abscessed tooth may need to be pulled. I have had two people call me to say that they added one teaspoon of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)to their 10-drop dose of MMS tooth-brushing solution, and after brushing hourly several times, were able to overcome an abscessed tooth in one day even when the abscess was inside the tooth. Although DMSO is readily available in the U.S., little is known about it in Europe. It has been used for more than 60 years in the U.S. to treat both animals (mostly horses) and people for many body pains\t and\t difficulties.\t It\t is\t a\t liquid\t much\t like\t kerosene,\t derived\t from\t wood, and has an amazing ability to penetrate the skin tissues and even tooth enamel and carry medication with it. If a small amount is poured into the palm of your hand, you will be able to taste it in your mouth within minutes. Caveat #1 •\t DMSO is an antioxidant that destroys the effectiveness of MMS in about 6 hours if left to sit unused. So to be sure of a successful outcome, you should use any mixture"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"90 Healing Diseases of DMSO and MMS within a couple of hours. Caveat #2 •\t You need to get rid of all metal in your mouth. Metal in your mouth creates voltages and currents that can be read on any voltmeter—it’s ruining your health. My friend regained his sight in one eye by merely replacing the metal in his mouth with non-metal\t fillings.\t His\t sight\t returned\t within\t 4\t hours\t of\t replacing\t the\t metal. It is simply a fact of physics and general science. Metal in an electrolyte makes a battery. Saliva is an electrolyte. That makes a battery. That means if you have metal in your mouth, you have voltages right next to your brain. Diabetes For diabetes , follow Protocol 1000 described in Chapter 13. Sometimes diabetes is easy to overcome and sometimes not. The ease of recovery is not determined by whether it is type 1 or type 2. As\t you\t know,\t diabetes\t is\t caused\t by\t inflammation\t of\t the\t pancreas.\t No\t doubt\t there\t are\t a\t number\t of\t different\t pathogens\t that\t inflame\t the\t pancreas, and some are easier to handle than others. Also there are many\t reasons\t why\t the\t pancreas\t might\t be\t inflamed\t or\t not\t working\t correctly. Many times, after a couple of weeks of MMS, the pancreas is alright and the diabetes is gone. But sometimes things are more complex. When the diabetes does not clear up in a couple of weeks, you should continue with Protocol 1000. If it does not clear up in 4 weeks, go to Protocol 2000 and continue until you are healed. Occasionally, people have told me that it took 3 months to clear up their diabetes. However that is rare. So the three scenarios for diabetes are: 1. It clears up in 4 or 5 days, which happens in about 10% of cases. 1. It clears up in less than 4 weeks, which happens in about 80% of cases 1. It takes as long as 3 months to clear up, which happens in about 10% of cases I assume that when something else in the body is causing the pancreas\t to\t be\t inflamed,\t that‘s\t when\t it\t takes\t as\t long\t as\t 3\t months\t to\t"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"91 Healing Diseases clear up. Once you have cleared up the diabetes, most of the virus, bacteria , molds, and yeast loads will be gone from your body and it will be clean. You can then focus on good nutrition, rather than on not feeding the microorganism load. Just keep taking MMS at a reduced level. You should be using good nutrition (eating well) all the time you are on Protocol 1000 or 2000 but add no vitamins or minerals or other nutritional supplements until you are well. Of course, there are no guarantees, but many people have stated that after following this procedure, they are back to normal. Your body will then be able to easily absorb vitamins and minerals and many other nutrients it might have been missing up to this time. You should feel better as time goes by. Do continue taking the MMS maintenance dose described in Chapter 13. Eye Conditions Follow these directions WITH EXTREME CARE. You can make your MMS dose in either of two ways: either with a 10% solution of citric acid or with a 50% solution. Please see Chapter 12 on General Procedural Information . For treating the eyes, use 4 to 6 drops of activated MMS in a half cup of water. Put one or two drops of this solution into your eye or eyes. Do this every 2 hours until the infection is gone . Also take MMS by mouth using 3- to 4-drop doses every hour until you notice a big improvement in your eyes. •\t If you cannot put drops in your eyes, you can depend upon the oral doses if you take them every hour. Activated MMS will not damage your eyes. Just be sure you are using pure distilled water or that your water is clean and that the MMS is clean. •\t Don’t use unactivated MMS as it has a very high pH (alkaline level) before the acid is added to it. It can burn your eyes. Note : I once burned my eye. I used unactivated MMS (I didn’t add any citric acid to it). I left it in my eye thinking that since I didn’t feel anything it didn’t have enough strength to do any damage. But unactivated MMS is very alkaline and it burned. It didn’t do any noticeable damage to my eyeball, but the skin around my eye drooped and stretched downward about an inch. I looked terrible, like my eyeball might fall out. I was worried, but it cleared up in a few"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"92 Healing Diseases days. So don’t use unactivated MMS especially in the eyes. Flu Types: Bird, Swine, Pig and Other Causes of Mass Hysteria For over 100 years, chlorine dioxide has been used to sterilize hospital\t floors , benches, and equipment, and to purify water and sterilize meat. During this time, no pathogen has ever developed any kind of successful resistance to it. Due to the nature of chlorine dioxide, it is doubtful that any pathogen ever will. Several biologists have mentioned that the very nature of microor- ganism structure eliminates the possibility of them ever developing a resistance to the oxidizing powers of chlorine dioxide. It’s like trying to develop resistance to hand grenades or dynamite. The explosions are too violent to resist. It is doubtful that any of the new mass hysteria diseases or germ warfare diseases will be able to resist chlorine dioxide (MMS). Chlorine dioxide was used to kill anthrax during the 2001 anthrax attack. Now anyone can use it in the body as well. Be sure to keep some in your medicine cabinet. At this time, the FDA, with the backing of the U.S. Congress, has stated that anyone claiming to have a cure \t for\t swine\t flu will be prosecuted and will serve prison time for making that claim. Well, I don’t sell MMS anywhere in the world so I can make any claims I want, as I have the protection of the Constitution of the USA. So let me say that not only has MMS already healed several cases of swine\t flu,\t but\t in\t my\t opinion,\t it\t will\t take\t care\t of\t all\t cases\t of\t swine\t flu\t quickly and easily. Be sure to check out Protocols 1000 and 2000 in Chapter 13. One other point: •\t The pharmaceutical companies had a vaccine for the swine flu\t long\t before\t there\t was\t any\t swine\t flu\t and\t any\t biologist\t will\t tell you that is impossible -- unless of course, they had the swine\tflu\tvirus\tlong\tbefore\tthey\tmentioned\tit.\t They talked about vaccinating everyone in the US. That was in the news, so don’t take my word for it. Thirty six states already have laws that allow them to vaccinate you by force. They have spent billions of dollars with Congress and state legislatures getting the correct laws to allow them to do this. Now they will make billions of dollars inoculating everyone, and then billions of dollars treating"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"93 Healing Diseases everyone for the diseases and poisons created by the inoculations. The vaccine that they have now contains mercury and other poisons. They will then want to vaccinate everyone in the world, if possible. They will say they want to save us, but all they really want to do is make billions of dollars. Keep in mind that MMS has been proven to kill\t influenzas\t of\t all\t kinds,\t and\t they\t cannot\t show\t you\t any\t clinical\t trials\t that\t prove\t their\t inoculation\t is\t stopping\t anyone\t from\t getting\t swine\t flu . I\t doubt\t that\t there\t is\t such\t thing\t as\t a\t flu\t that\t can\t resist\t MMS.\t That\t is\t especially\t true\t of\t the\t swine\t flu\t that\t they\t have\t been\t spreading\t around. Just keep some MMS handy, and don’t accept inoculations of any kind. They contain poisons that will affect you for the rest of your life. They will steal years from your life, and make you miserable most of the time. The proof is all on the internet. This book is not about vaccinations, but I have included Chapter 23 on Vaccines . You should educate yourself about them, as they have never worked. People live longer these days, but with more sickness. More die from heart disease , cancer and dozens of other diseases than they ever did. Again, there are no studies proving that vaccinations reduce diseases. There is just a lot of double talk. When you ask to see the actual studies proving their contentions that vaccinations reduce the number of people catching the disease, whatever disease they may be talking about, including polio, the only\t thing\t you\t get\t is\t a\t lot\t of\t impressive\t scientific\t double\t talk,\t but\t no\t actual evidence. Quit being one of the sheep and become one of the wolves. The Japanese government bought tens of millions of dollars’ worth of\t swine\t flu\t vaccinations \tbut\t the\t Japanese\t people\t refused\t to\t take\t it,\t thus costing their government millions for nothing. Head Sores See Skin Problems later in this chapter. Comb through enough MMS solution to penetrate the hair and reach the scalp. This will treat most head sores in a few days and scalp itchiness also. If you use it daily, it will make your scalp healthy. Hepatitis – All Strains Please see the instructions for HIV above and follow it closely for Hepatitis . See Chapter 13 for protocols ."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 Healing Diseases Herpes The ads on TV will make you heartsick when you realize that herpes can be cured if the immune system has the proper ammunition. It takes a while, but there are those who have reported success and herpes can no longer be found in their bodies. The updated protocols described in Chapter 13 will generally handle herpes. Start with Protocol 1000 and if that doesn’t do the job, go to Protocol 2000 and add in Protocol 3000 . In most cases Protocol 1000 will do it, but it may take a few weeks. People like to bash the idea that the diseases discussed here can be healed by the immune system using MMS. So before you send me a combative letter, why don’t you just try MMS? It won’t cost you much and what you learn might eventually save your life. If it doesn’t work, then send me a letter explaining what you did and what you are trying to treat. Perhaps I can help you get the dosage right. Just know that for every criticism I have received, there have been many hundreds of encouraging reports. See my website www. jimhumble.biz and look under “Method for life threatening diseases.” Also realize that not one single critic has ever understood MMS (chlorine dioxide) chemistry, and those who bothered to learn it are no longer critics. Please see Chapter 9 on Critics of MMS and Jim Humble . HIV and AIDS In the case of HIV and AIDS, there is usually no need to go beyond 3 drops of MMS an hour. Other diseases, especially cancer , require more drops per hour – read the cancer protocol in Chapter 13 . Normally, HIV or AIDS takes 3 weeks of Protocol 1000 (also given in Chapter 13). After 3 weeks, you should be well and when you are, it is advisable to continue with 6 drops daily, taken all at one time, for health maintenance. On the HIV and AIDS regimen (Protocol 1000), take 3 activated drops of MMS each hour for at least 8 hours a day for three weeks. If you become nauseous or have diarrhea or any other discomfort, reduce the number of drops until the discomfort is gone and then begin increasing them per hour until you are again taking 3 drops of MMS activated with either 15 drops of lemon juice or citric acid or 3 drops of 50% citric acid."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"95 Healing Diseases Unfortunately, the current tests for HIV only test for the presence of HIV antibodies. The problem with this is that even if you are negative for HIV, you will probably always test positive for antibodies, and thus there is no real proven way to check that you are really negative. However, you can always decide how you are feeling and you can have a CD4 test to see that your white blood cells are back to normal. It’s a pretty good indication that you are HIV negative when your CD4 count is increasing towards normal or at normal (that’s a count of 400 or more). Later, I plan to see that a test is provided that proves negative. The standard HIV test gives many false positives, causing many people to take ARVs (Anti Retro Viral Drugs) when they shouldn’t be doing so. About Viral Load Readings Here is an important point to keep in mind. Should you have a viral load test done for anything before you are completely well, it will read extremely high. In hundreds of cases in Mexico and Africa, the viral load always increased out of sight when the person was taking MMS. The reading often went up to 8 or 9 million and even more. Most of the doctors at the hospitals where my people were tested had never seen viral load readings that high. However, those readings\ton\tall\tof\tour\tpeople\tfinally\twent\tto\tzero. You should know, and this is data on the internet that you can check, that less than 10% of the viral load of any disease is found in the blood, yet the blood is what they test. •\t Viruses that cause HIV and Hepatitis C attack the white blood cells.\t These\tcells\tbecome\tfilled\twith\tviruses.\t •\t The presence of MMS in the blood causes the viruses in the white blood cells to multiply faster and the cells explode, dis- tributing the viruses through the blood and thus drastically increasing the viral load reading. •\t As long as MMS is present, the white blood cells with viruses inside continue to explode, increasing the viral count only until all such cells are killed. Then the viruses in the blood die because their special proteins cannot form while MMS is present. And so you see! A temporarily high reading is necessary. And the fact that you have just got a high reading, maybe a million or two"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"96 Healing Diseases higher than before, proves that MMS is working because it would be totally impossible for the HIV to grow that fast. The HIV is not suddenly growing. It is coming from the white blood cells as they die. However, it quickly drops to zero as the protocol continues. Please do not be concerned -- it always drops to zero if the protocol is observed. Beware of ARVs (Anti Retro Viral Drugs) ARV drugs are extremely poisonous. They are supposed to be poisoning the HIV virus, but the fact is, they are poisoning the HIV patient faster than the HIV, and the virus is going to be still living when the patient is dead. •\t Once you are on MMS, quit using the ARVs. MMS will kill the HIV and you will still be doing OK 50 years from now. If you don’t believe me about what ARVs are doing to you, obtain a box of the ARVs you are taking that is from the factory that makes them. The law requires them to state the side effects on that box or in the box on a sheet. But most hospitals remove the ARVs from the factory box and put them into a pleasant-looking blue box to prevent you from seeing the list of side effects. Please see Chapter 22 for more about ARVs . ARVs won’t prevent the MMS from working and healing you. They will just eventually kill you. Consider that we already have 800 patients cleared of HIV in our African jungle program, in our opinion. They all feel good and are happy with their results. I don’t believe you could convince any of them that they still have HIV. MMS neutralizes the ARV and evidently the poison too, as they feel good so long as they are taking MMS. The 20 patients out of the 800 who quit taking ARVs also continued to feel good without taking MMS. Those who continued taking the ARV also needed to take the MMS to keep the ARVs neutralized. Doses Larger Than 15 Drops The only reason we take 15 drops nowadays is for treatment of malaria and then we take two 15-drop doses one hour apart. Never, never, never start off with large doses otherwise, except for snake bites or food poisoning. Two doses within 1 or 2 hours counts as one dose with the two doses added together. Be careful. Keep in mind that we always get the best results from many small doses,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"97 Healing Diseases rather than a large dose. So really, even in emergencies, just do hourly doses and keep at it; or in really bad emergencies such as snake bites or food poisoning , do 6-drop doses every 15 minutes. I should tell you that some people have reported that their immune system and the body took care of prostate cancer when they took as much as 60 drops per dose. At least one person has reported taking 100 drops a day for over a week. \t Do not decide that because you are tough you can take large doses. It could be very serious. Never allow yourself to feel sick, and if that happens, immediately reduce\t the\t number\t of\t drops\t that\t you\t are\t taking.\t There\t is\t no\t benefit\t to taking large doses when you are nauseous . Exceptions to the Rule One should only start off with a large dose, such as 15 drops, in the case of parasites including malaria . Also, if you have taken a poison or have food poisoning, a higher dose of MMS will often help. I am recommending the use of lemon , lime, or 10% or 50% citric acid instead of vinegar . All other factors should remain the same. When counting drops, always use 5 drops of lemon or lime juice or 5 drops of the 10% citric acid for each drop of MMS. If using 50% citric acid, count just one drop for each MMS drop. Vinegar has a tendency to feed candida and there are those who have reported a worsening of candida infection after a few days of using vinegar as an activator for MMS. Insect Bites A really serious mosquito bite or insect sting can be very uncomfort- able for several hours. To treat such bites, put one drop of unactivated MMS (no citric acid) on a saucer or on the table. Put\t your\t finger\t tip\t or\t a\t Q-tip\t in\t the\t drop\t and\t then\t on\t the\t bite\t and\t rub it in. The alkalinity of the MMS will neutralize the acid in the bite. Avoid rubbing any of the surrounding skin. The itching from the bite will be gone in less than 5 minutes and the bump will begin to diminish immediately. You do not need to wash the solution off the small area of the bite. When using MMS on areas of the body larger than a small insect bite, always add about an eighth of a cup of water to a 10-drop"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"98 Healing Diseases solution of activated MMS. That’s 10 drops per ounce as given later in this chapter under Skin Problems. The itching of a mosquito bite is caused by acidic poison and not by pathogens. Larger areas of the skin \t will\t not\t benefit\t from\t using\t unactivated\t MMS\t as\t the\t activator\t neutralizes the alkalinity and prevents it from burning the skin. All other skin problems are caused by pathogens and thus require activated MMS. Lou Gehrig’s Disease There is medical literature indicating that the echoviruses type 6 and type 7 are most likely the cause of ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease ). If this is so, then there is a chance that MMS can help ALS victims. I would start with 1 or 2 drops every hour and increase to 6 or 8 drops every hour for as long as one is awake and up out of bed. Of course, you should use the citric acid activator , either: (a) a 10% solution, adding 5 drops for each MMS drop and waiting 3 minutes; or (b) a 50% solution, adding one drop for each MMS drop and waiting 20 seconds. Then add the juice or water and drink the solution. The idea is to keep the body as saturated as possible with chlorine dioxide . Of course there is no guarantee, but up until this time there has never even been a slight glimmer of hope for ALS sufferers. If you are diagnosed with ALS, you are given 2 to 5 years and that’s all. It has been claimed that something was discovered that slowed ALS down a bit, and of course, the medical community gets a lot of money for it, but there is no real data indicating that it actually does slow ALS. MMS may just work, and since nothing else does, it’s worth a try. I would use Protocols 2000 and 3000 given in Chapter 13 and any other techniques you can use to get MMS into the body. See Chapter 24 . Use the bag treatment, baths, foot baths, breathing the fumes in other words everything. Try different things. Keep at it. But remember; don’t make the patient feel sicker than he already feels. Malaria The procedure for malaria is to always start with a 15-drop dose and give a second 15-drop dose in 1 to 2 hours. •\t Remember, if you use a standard eye dropper, multiply all"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"99 Healing Diseases figures\t by\t 1.5.\t In\t this\t case,\t the\t dosage\t would\t be\t rounded\t off\t to 23 drops of MMS. Expect most of the symptoms to be gone within 4 hours of the second dose, but don’t worry if they are not -- simply give a third dose. All malaria parasites are dead after the second dose, so if the patient is still sick you can try a third 15-drop dose in 2 or 3 hours. But if the patient is still sick, there is no doubt another disease present and in any case begin Protocol 2000 until they are well. With regard to the immune system, chlorine dioxide is more powerful than any drug by far and more powerful than any nutrient. With chlorine\t dioxide,\t the\t immune\t system\t identifies\t and\t attacks\t many\t things that are not natural to the body, and does it immediately. In addition, it destroys poisons that have been generated by the disease. That’s why thousands of malaria patients have gotten up out of their beds and gone home just 4 hours after taking a dose and why many AIDS patients in Uganda have gone home just 3 days after being treated. In fact, a single dose has, at times, provided the immune systems of some individuals with enough ammunition to totally overcome hepatitis C . On very rare occasions, someone may have a little nausea or other reaction from 2 drops, but that will seldom be the case. When I say rare, I mean one in 500 cases. But remember, in treating malaria and some other diseases caused by parasites , one does not start with only 2 drops. The malaria victim is very sick and needs relief. It takes 15 drops to do any good, so give them 15 drops and wait an hour or a little more and then give them another 15 drops. They will experience tremendous relief and the malaria parasite will be dead. On rare occasions, they may need a third dose. Other diseases caused by parasites should be handled similarly; although some diseases have the ability to dig in deep and it may take weeks or even months of taking MMS for the immune system to completely destroy them. The fact is that MMS is usually extremely fast acting. The malaria in each area is different. A friend just back from Uganda used 6 drops and then another 6 drops in an hour and that healed all of the malaria patients he treated (70 cases). A Malaria Story On the other hand, when I arrived deep in Africa, there was a woman"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"100 Healing Diseases standing in a doorway right next to my room at the Catholic Hotel. Someone said she had malaria. So I looked into her eyes and saw a familiar sight – the dead tired look of someone who is only a few hours from death. She said the malaria drugs didn’t seem to be working and she didn’t feel so good, but that she was going back to the doctor for some more malaria pills the next day. It didn’t look to me like she would last to the next day, but that was just from what I had seen before. You couldn’t really tell by looking. However I said, “I have some really new malaria stuff here. I think you could be all right soon. Would you care to try?” Well, she wasn’t too excited about something new but I talked her into it. So I gave her a 15 drop dose, waited one hour and gave her another 15 drop dose. I never had a failure before from that much MMS, but in the regular 4 hours she wasn’t feeling better. I said, I need to give you another dose, but she said no. At about 12 hours after the second dose she was feeling OK, but a few hours later she was again feeling bad. The next day, I said, “I need to give you 6-drop doses every hour,” and she said, “No thanks. I have just got the standard malaria pills.” Well, a few hours later she was feeling OK. So what really happened? In my opinion, she really was in a bad condition. Maybe close to death, but at least she would have been sick for weeks yet. I have looked at it under the microscope a number of times. There were so many malaria parasites in her blood that two MMS doses did not kill them all. It was too many, but the MMS did drastically weaken them. I’ve seen it before. Where their outer surface is usually nice and smooth, when they are weakened, it is wrinkled and looks bad. Then when the standard drugs were given to her, they killed the weakened parasites without any problem, and she was OK within hours. Then of course, she was convinced that the standard drugs saved her. The fact was, those standard drugs would not have even had an effect on the parasites without the help of MMS, but she will never know. The parasites seem to have different capabilities from place to place and you can never be sure that you are giving the right amount of MMS until you try it. So far, nowhere that I have been in Africa, did any malaria parasites ever resist MMS, but from time to time I have been required to increase the strength of the dose."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"101 Healing Diseases Skin Problems I have been having many people make up spray bottles of MMS, since I myself have been doing this for several years now. I use 20 drops of MMS and 20 drops of a 50% citric acid solution, wait 20 seconds, and then add 2 ounces of water. It’s most convenient to use a 2-ounce spray bottle bought from a pharmacy. Just put the drops\t in\t the\t spray\t bottle,\t wait\t 20\t seconds,\t and\t fill\t it\t with\t water.\t If\t you\t have only a 10% citric acid solution, mix 20 drops of MMS with 100 drops of citric acid and wait three minutes. With a lid on the container, this skin spray will last 5 to 6 days and longer before losing its potency. I have sprayed my skin every day for more than 3 years, and sometimes two or three times a day with this 20-drop dose. I have sprayed all the delicate areas of my body, but have kept several areas unsprayed, so that I can compare them with the sprayed areas. After a year, there is no difference in sprayed areas compared to unsprayed areas. That shows that MMS has no effect on body cells, just as the chemical theory predicts. It only kills pathogens on the body cells; it does not affect the body cells themselves. Of course, we need lots of research in this and other areas. Millions of dollars of MMS research is needed, but I have been using it for more than 10 years and it has helped hundreds of thousands of people. In addition to conducting the above test, I have used this 20-drop dose for spraying various problems on the skin, on both adults and children , including babies. •\t If you spray it on a child or adult and it stings, immediately rinse it off with clean water; however, I have never had that problem. If it stings, there is some sort of a problem that needs handling. You may have to use Aztec Clay if MMS is stinging badly (see below). I have also used this solution for spraying skin cancers. Although all cancers do not react the same way, I have seen cancer tumors as big as an orange dry up and fall off piece by piece. In one such case, I sprayed the cancer every hour, leaving the solution to dry in place, and then rinsed it all off once a day. In rare instances, someone has sprayed a skin rash and immediately felt a burning sensation and the condition has worsened. This may happen when the rash is the result of a body fungus. See Body"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"102 Healing Diseases Fungus below. If you use a clear spray bottle, you can see when it loses its power, as chlorine dioxide is yellow in solution and the solution will slowly turn water color. When you notice the solution less yellow that it has been, it’s time to dump it out and make some fresh solution. Aztec Clay (Bentonite) for Body Fungus Very rarely, people get a fungus on their feet that is far worse than standard athlete’s foot. This fungus can occur anywhere on the body, including in the mouth. It is terrible and causes extreme itching, cracking of the skin, and eruptions that seep liquid that spreads the fungus. While MMS will take care of athlete’s foot in one application, it has no healing powers when it comes to this particular fungus. When MMS is sprayed or applied to it on the feet, or anywhere else on the body, the rash immediately burns and seems to get worse. Usually it does get worse, as the MMS clears out the other pathogens, making it easy for the fungus to spread. There is a natural miracle mineral that will destroy this fungus almost as quickly as MMS destroys other skin problems . It is sold in health food stores as Aztec clay .\t It\t was\t first\t discovered\t in\t France\t over\t 300\t years ago and the Aztec Indians used this same clay in America. In France, it is called Montmorillonite. The commercial name is Bentonite \tand\t you\t should\t be\t able\t to\t find\t some\t almost\t anywhere\t in\t the world. This clay has millions of microscopic holes and each hole has a powerful charge of electricity. The charge draws microorgan - isms into the hole and they cannot get back out. This is another method of killing pathogens and even viruses . Bentonite Procedure Purchase the clay and mix it with 50% Vaseline (petroleum jelly). Then smear this liberally on the affected area. If this is your feet and toes, put socks on over the mess and go ahead and go to work. If this is anywhere else on the body, spread the affected area liberally, cover it all with a clean cloth, and tape the cloth down. You will need to put a fresh mixture on at least once every 8 hours. Regardless of where the infection is, it will be gone in about 3 days after you begin this regimen. •\t If the fungus has gotten into your mouth and you have tried everything in the world, brush your teeth three or four times a day with a soft toothbrush dipped in the dry Aztec clay powder."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"103 Healing Diseases If you have false teeth, make a mixture of water and clay and apply the mixture under the false teeth every few hours. You may swallow some of the clay, but that is not a problem. People have been taking this clay for hundreds of years. It’s good for you. If the fungus has gotten into your stomach, take at least two tablespoons of clay each day, one in the morning and one in the evening. Put the clay into half a glass of water and drink it down, or you can use juice. Extra Treatment For Skin Problems In case of any kind of skin problem such as rashes, sores, small cancers, or psoriasis , do this in addition to the 3 drops per hour taken by mouth: •\t In a normal 8 ounce glass, add 20 drops of MMS1 and either: ◊\t 100 drops of lemon or lime juice or 10% citric acid , or ◊\t 20 drops of 50% citric acid. Swirl to mix, and wait 3 minutes if using 10% citric acid or just 20 seconds if using 50% citric. Then add a quarter of a glass (2 ounces) of water. If you have a spray bottle, use that to spray the skin problem once an hour,\t or\t just\t put\t your\t fingers\t into\t the\t liquid\t and\t dab\t it\t on\t once\t each\t hour. Let it dry on the skin. Then once or twice a day, rinse it off with clean water before adding more. If you cover the glass, the mixture will last up to a week. If this mixture burns and stings more than just a little bit, wash it off with clean water and use instead the data in this book about fungus. See Aztec Clay (Bentonite) For Body Fungus directly above, and also Aztec Clay for Fungus Problems in Chapter 18. That chapter is about animals, but the information on Aztec clay is the same for humans. MMS does not burn or sting beyond a minute or two. If it stings and burns longer you most likely have a fungus. MMS helps the fungus grow by clearing the way for it to grow. Be sure to follow the fungus protocol given above. I have treated cancers as large as an orange on a person’s neck or the same size on their ankle. They should just continue MMS1 and MMS2 by mouth and then spray the MMS1 using the above 20-drop formula. If you are treating cancers on the outside of the body, they should"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"104 Healing Diseases start getting dry in several days. Eventually they will crack and pieces will begin to fall off. Don’t pull the pieces off; just let them fall off. The cancer may then bleed a little. These are all good indications, as this is the process of the cancer becoming smaller and eventually disap - pearing. Don’t, however, try to treat cancers only from the outside with MMS. Also take MMS by mouth as described in Protocol 2000 and even add Protocol 3000. (See Chapter 13, MMS Protocols .) Spider Bites In the event of a brown recluse spider bite, use diaper rash ointment – Desitin or some other diaper rash ointment containing at least 40% zinc oxide. I mention this because some people have tried to use MMS and it has had very little effect. Since Desitin contains 40% zinc oxide, it will kill most of the poison and reduce the pain and itching of a brown recluse spider bite in less than one day. I have seen dozens of people successfully treat their bites with this diaper rash ointment. You should also take MMS hourly for a few days. As long as we are talking about spider bites, let me mention a remedy for black widow bites: •\t Slice open a freshly cut aloe vera leaf (about 2” x 2”) and put the open side against the bite. •\t Tape it over the bite, being sure to hold it tight against the bite, excluding most air. •\t Leave it in place for at least 12 hours before putting a fresh piece on. Most, or all, of the poison will be gone in 12 hours. There can be complications, so always take MMS hourly for a few days. Do not become discouraged. Some spider bites can take a week or two to clear up, but most are cleared up in a day or two if you follow these instructions. Continue taking MMS at least 4 times a day. All Known Diseases and Negative Medical Conditions I have not listed a great number of diseases which can be handled by the immune system in hours, days, or only a week or two, as there are so many. MMS will help the immune system do its job regardless of the disease being addressed. Diseases that are not caused by viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens may not be attacked"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"105 Healing Diseases directly\tby\tMMS,\tbut\tbenefits\tmay\tcome\tindirectly.\t Almost any disease generates poisons , which in turn cause the body to be sick. When the immune system has chlorine dioxide , which, of course, is furnished by MMS, it can often neutralize such poisons. Never assume that MMS cannot improve the immune system, regardless of how weak the person might be or what disease is present in the body. Take MMS daily or twice a week to keep the body clean of most poisons and disease-causing organisms. See Daily Procedure For Dental and Respiratory Health in Chapter 13. Diseases That MMS Cannot Help Directly The immune system can use MMS to attack diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites , fungus, yeast, and molds. But some diseases are caused by other medical conditions. Regardless, since the\t release\t of\t the\t first\t book,\t thousands\t of\t people\t have\t reported\t improvement of almost every medical condition known with the use of MMS. •\t Thus, there are really no examples of diseases that do not respond to MMS. Some diseases need to be handled by proper diet, but the immune system, when supplied with MMS, almost always produces some improvement in all diseases and their associated conditions. Everyone who has reported taking MMS to treat lupus has also reported feeling as though they are back to normal. Many people with diabetes who have taken MMS have also reported doing better, and many have reported that all their symptoms were gone. Even those with depression have reported feeling better. It was reported that all the symptoms of one child with ADHD were gone in two weeks. At this time, in a Mexican clinic, more than 80 ADD children are taking MMS and all have reported improvement. There\t are\t many\t benefits\t to\t be\t realized\t from\t improving\t the\t immune\t system, as diseases often result from a weakened condition and a weakened immune system. Bacteria and viruses have a tendency to attack weakened areas of the body. Pneumonia , for example, is more likely to develop when the body is weakened. With MMS, the immune\t system\t can\t fight\t back\t and\t often\t overcome\t infections and other conditions that have been caused by a weakened condition. This, in turn, can help clear up other diseases."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"106 Healing Diseases For those people who would like to overcome a bad condition that has not been caused by bacteria or viruses, I recommend you read Eat to Live, by Joel Fuhrman, M.D. This book will provide you with many important insights into the causes of such conditions and how to overcome them. However, I have come to question the idea that any bad condition exists that is not caused by microorganisms of one kind or another. To restate that, I believe that all unhealthy conditions that exist in the body are caused by microorganisms of some type. An “unhealthy diet” is a diet that encourages various microorganisms to grow, and a healthy diet is really a diet that discourages microorganisms. Sugar is not necessarily bad for the body, but it encourages the growth of microorganisms. The more raw foods a diet includes, the fewer microorganisms are encouraged to grow. Thus, time after time for the past ten years, hundreds of diseased and unhealthy conditions have been cleared up merely by giving a person MMS. Typically, MMS will eventually clear up any conditions that are caused directly or indirectly by pathogens . #####"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"107 Signs That MMS is Working Signs That MMS is Working *** But That You Have Overdosed *** A ctivated MMS (chlorine dioxide) kills pathogens on contact. It also breaks up molecular compounds such as heavy metal compounds in the body. As soon as you swallow your MMS dose, it starts to work on clearing the bad stuff out of your system. Healthy people can generally take MMS without nausea -- it is only people sick with some kind of disease who will get nauseous when taking it. However, nausea is a good indication that the MMS drops are working. The immune system attacks unhealthy conditions using MMS. There has never been any evidence of an attack on healthy cells, but if one supplies the immune system with extra MMS, it appears to attack unhealthy conditions more vigorously. It’s what the body needs, but a nauseous reaction sometimes occurs and occasionally someone will vomit. This simply indicates that the dose was too large. Signs that MMS is working are: •\t Diarrhea •\t Stomach ache •\t Fatigue •\t Vomiting •\t Nausea All these conditions are temporary. They tell you that the body has more dead pathogens or disintegrating toxins than it can quickly handle. In other words, it has been overdosed. So reduce your next MMS dose to allow your body to catch up with you. If these conditions are too severe to tolerate, you should stop taking MMS until they’re gone. Then resume at a lower dose. It’s a process of learning what your body can handle. When a person is very sick, start with a half-drop dose or less. Wait a\t couple\t of\t hours\t and\t increase\t the\t dose\t if\t the\t first\t one\t didn’t\t make\t him nauseous . Back off for a while if he shows signs of feeling sicker. •\t A sick person should receive a dose of some strength every hour during the day for at least 8 hours, but they should be small doses . See Protocol 1000 in Chapter 13 . If bad nausea persists, take as little as a quarter of a drop an hour."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"108 Signs That MMS is Working It’s OK to stop until nausea is gone, but a small amount of nausea may continue for some time. Do not let a tiny bit of nausea stop you. Only stop if it gets to be irritating. •\t Normally, very little nausea or diarrhea is noticed, but it does happen. What Causes the Nausea? Nausea is part of what is called the Herxheimer reaction – also called “detox illness ”. It is caused by dying pathogens dumping poison into the system. A normal healthy person notices absolutely nothing from taking a great deal more than 3 drops of MMS an hour. The more health problems you have, the more likely you will be to notice nausea , and perhaps also vomiting , diarrhea and/or severe fatigue . MMS is killing cancer viruses and other pathogens faster than your elimination system can clear the blood and make the debris exit. So-called “dirty blood” can cause headaches as well as nausea. Any other diseases being killed that are present in your body will also be releasing poisons and the body must carry those poisons off. Everyone\t differs\t in\t the\t efficiency\t of\t their\t elimination\t systems,\t and\t in\t the heavy toxic load they have been carrying that may have caused the cancer or other diseases. Therefore no one can state that nausea will occur on day two or day ten. When overloaded with debris in the blood, you must slow down the doses of both MMS1 and MMS2, allowing the blood to clear. Gradually this nausea barrier will fade away. When\t we\t first\t learned\t about\t the\t effectiveness\t of\t citric\t acid , I measured the strength of the solution. The chlorine dioxide present measured much higher than when vinegar , or lime or lemon juices were used, but people seemed to handle it better. Thus, I decided to determine what a reasonably healthy body could tolerate by taking it myself. I started low and built up to 30 drops twice a day. I never felt any nausea or other negative reactions. Therefore, we know (based on the reports of hundreds of people other than myself) that as long as there is nothing to be killed, destroyed, or neutralized, one can expect no reaction from an MMS dose. Sometimes, even sick people do not experience nausea when taking MMS; however, do not be surprised if someone does get sick, become nauseous, develop diarrhea , or even vomit after taking a few drops of MMS. To help minimize these reactions, try to take (or"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"109 Signs That MMS is Working give) it a half to one hour after a small meal. MMS allows the immune system to correct various conditions in the body, thereby creating substances that the body must expel. This is normal. However, if you always start with 1 or 2 drops it is unlikely that you will make anyone nauseous . Dealing With the Nausea After the MMS doses have been reduced or temporarily stopped, there are some ways in which you can help the nausea dissipate: Drink some cold water •\t Drink some juice •\t Eat a bite or two of something •\t Add a rounded teaspoon of baking soda to a glass of water and drink it •\t Take some Alka-Seltzer Apples Are Effective Apples are an important anti-nausea tool. They often stop the nausea and will be the best way to stop nausea for many people. Eat one apple about 15 minutes before taking MMS. Do that for three or four or\tfive\thourly\tdoses\tand\tjust\tcontinue\twith\tthe\tprotocol.\t You can grind the apple into apple sauce with a food grinder of one kind or another, but always use fresh apples as they absorb the poisons\t more\t efficiently\t than\t day-old\t apple\t sauce.\t It\t should\t be\t eaten\t immediately after grinding. In general, a sick person will begin to feel better within 24 hours. Just don’t give up on MMS. Reduce the number of drops per dose until the person is not experiencing nausea. You may have to reduce down to a quarter of a drop an hour. Then start increasing the drops with each dose as long as the person does not become nauseous. If you have to go to a quarter or half drop for a long time to prevent nausea , that is OK, but you may then need to extend your protocol an extra week or so. Diarrhea and Vomiting If you take MMS in any quantity, you may get diarrhea. Not everyone gets it, but some people need to be cleaned out. If that is true in your case, you will probably not be able to avoid diarrhea. It seems that"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"110 Signs That MMS is Working the body knows what is needed when MMS is taken. As the immune system becomes more active, more things begin to take place in the body. There are things that your body does not want your digestive system to process, so it will cause vomiting It hasn’t hurt a single person so far, and everyone has felt better after vomiting. In every case, when diarrhea hits or vomiting takes place, assume that it is needed and that it is a good indication that healing is taking place. In rare cases, the body’s bowel system is not working and a person may vomit to eliminate poisons and waste from their system. A person may even develop skin rashes as the poisons attempt to get out through the skin. In such cases, use a laxative. The best one that I know is the Senna herb. Sennosides are extracted from the Senna herb and they exercise the bowel muscles, expelling more waste than any other method. Sennosides are sold by Walmart and by health food stores and pharmacies and used by millions of people. Severe Fatigue When the body is very busy dealing with dead pathogens and trying to eliminate all the toxins and debris, it can get tired. If the MMS doses have been a little too high, the fatigue can be severe, such that a person cannot stay awake. At work, a person might fall asleep with their head on the desk. At home, a good nap might be inevitable. The condition is not painful or uncomfortable. It only lasts for a couple of hours, and during that time you may feel like you simply\t do\tnot\twant\tto\tmove.\t This\textra\tsleep\t is\tbeneficial\t and\thelps\t the body clear itself of disease. However, if the fatigue is more severe than is acceptable or practical, lower MMS doses will help. As with nausea, just use smaller doses until the body can catch up with elimination and does not get so tired. Then gradually increase the dosage again, staying just under the “nausea barrier”, according to the particular protocol you are using. See Chapter 13 for descriptions of all the MMS protocols . #####"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"111     MMS2 MMS2 O nce you have one master healer, you have got to suspect that there are more, and the fact is, there are indeed more. It isn’t all that hard to come up with others. If the medical people were doing what they like the public to believe they do, they would have invented these solutions before I was born. They are chemicals that the body has been using for thousands of years. Industry has been using them for at least 100 years to kill pathogens in\t water,\t on\t meat,\t on\t hospital\t floors and in a hundred other places. If the medical profession was looking to cure people, they would have discovered these things long ago, as they have been there all along. The logic should have gone something like this: •\t “Hmm, let’s see now, this particular chemical is used by the immune system to kill pathogens and other organisms that the body needs to get rid of, and this same chemical is used in industry to kill pathogens and other organisms that industry needs to get rid of. I wonder if we supplied the body with a little extra chemical, would it be more able to kill the same pathogens, since the body is already using this chemical? Maybe it doesn’t have enough when under an attack from a lethal disease.” It’s so obvious that, in my opinion, medical science should have come up with several miracle substances long ago. Keep in mind that both MMS1 and MMS2 are chemicals that the human immune system has been using for hundreds of thousands of years. That isn’t something I have thought up. There are thousands of research papers that explain that and it has been known for more than 50 years. It’s probably pretty hard to understand why medical people haven’t been using those two chemicals to enhance the immune system for at least 50 years, but they never have. Amazing. The name of the MMS2 chemical is calcium hypochlorite . Don’t use any other chemical. Of course it would be nice if we had pharmaceutical grade chemicals to put in our gel capsules , but we do have swimming pool grade chemicals and the manufacturers of these must maintain a fairly pure chemical or they would be poisoning swimmers. The fact is, I have checked the quality of swimming pool chemicals and there are no poisonous chemicals used. Further, the trace"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"112 MMS2 chemicals are all at a limit below what is suggested that your system can tolerate, given the amount that you will be ingesting in my protocol. Keep in mind that the human skin is a body organ that can absorb more than the human stomach. So swimming pool manufac- turers must be fairly careful. Please read through this protocol about 10 times, use the data here in this book, or go to my web site www.jimhumble.biz and get the data to make MMS2 capsules .\t Perhaps\t you\t are\t already\t proficient\t in\t this sort of thing. Do it for yourself or someone else. In my opinion and from the people I have already seen recover or at least get a lot better, you have a better than 90% chance of recovery if you have a stage IV cancer . If you go the medical route, according to The American Cancer Society you have less than a 3% chance of recovery. If any of the 23,000 known skin diseases are involved, refer to Chapter 23, Methods Other Than Oral of Using MMS . You can also visit the section regarding MMS tub baths on my web site www. jimhumble.biz . Note the pictures and list of skin diseases. Hypochlorous Acid The immune system uses this acid to kill many things, including disease pathogens . But one of the chemicals that the body manu- factures in order to make hypochlorous acid is known as myeloper - oxidase,\t and\t it\t is\t often\t deficient\t in\t the\t human\t body.\t Thus\t there\t is\t often not enough hypochlorous acid. This is known by medical science. There are articles written about it.\t (Go\t to\t Google\t and\t search\t “myeloperoxidase\t deficiency ”. Some 30,000 articles are listed.) So one would have thought that medical science would have just given sick people some extra hypochlorous acid. But guess what, it never happened. So I did it. Well, I was only partially that smart. Actually my friend next door in the Nevada desert, Bill Boynton, came over one day and said that calcium hypochlorite killed germs in swimming pools and it might just be another MMS. He suggested that we try taking small amounts and\tsee\twhat\thappens.\tI\tfigured\tif\the\twas\tgame\tto\tdo\tit,\tI\twas\ttoo. We made up some gel capsules with calcium hypochlorite in them and started taking them and when they didn’t kill us, we had some friends take them. Then a few people who had prostate cancer took"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"113     MMS2 them. At the time, people with prostate cancer were the only ones available who were willing to test the new capsules. So far as I know, not a single person who took these capsules failed to get better or completely healed. I\t did\t the\t research\t on\t it\t to\t finally\t realize\t that\t the\t calcium\t hypochlorite\t was turning into hypochlorous acid. I decided to use the gel caps and started sending it out to people in the gel cap form. It’s something a doctor could never do. He has the Hippocratic Oath and AMA and FDA looking over his shoulder. But I am an inventor and never took that oath. If you ask me whether I would rather take a chance in hopes of saving a million lives or be safe and never take a chance, especially with people who would die anyway, my answer is that I would rather take the chance. And so would they, and there are a number of people alive today who are glad they took the chance. So there you go, calcium hypochlorite turns to 100% hypochlorous acid when dissolved in water. However, you can’t buy it in 100% pure form. It comes anywhere from 55% to 80% pure. •\t In general, don’t use anything less than 68% pure, as the lower\t percentage\t products\t have\t clarifiers\t and\t stabilizers\t in\t them. But in a pinch, even those could be used, as chemical companies are not going to poison swimmers. I bought it from pool stores. Guess what? It is “pool chlorine ”. That’s it. We’ve been taking “pool chlorine.” But it is not really pool chlorine. In our stomach it really does turn to hypochlorous acid. The other chemicals that come with it are considered non-toxic. They are sodium chemicals like sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate. They come in foods and other processes that are safe to eat and safe to swim in. Pool chlorine -- calcium hypochlorite -- doesn’t turn into chlorine like most people think. It turns to hypochlorous acid that has chlorine in it, but like MMS and table salt, it does not react in your body like chlorine. When you buy this chemical, calcium hypochlorite, the container will say 45%, 55%, 68%, or 78%, or even 85% available chlorine . •\t BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE. There is no available chlorine in this chemical. When it is dissolved in water it turns into hypochlorous acid, not chlorine. There is no available chlorine. It is hypochlorous acid that kills the pathogens in the swimming pool and hypochlorous acid"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"114 MMS2 (HOCl) is no more chlorine than table salt (NaCl).

Most of them never took as many as 5 capsules a day, as I advised them to stop taking them if they felt queasy or nauseous . And then we started adding the calcium hypochlorite (hypochlorous acid) gel caps to our suggestions for treating all kinds of cancer. We have had many good reports. Wish I could tell you their names but then, that’s what they would use to put me in jail. Again, I suggest that you take from 1 to 5 capsules a day while treating cancer or other life-threatening diseases. You can read more about treating severe diseases on my website www.jimhumble.biz . You can just add these capsules to any procedure. There is no doubt that many people would have done the same as me if the same situation had been presented to them. I’m glad that I happen to be the one who was in the right place at the right time. Of course it needed an inventor type attitude to carry it through. Inventors are not scientists, but they are knowledgeable enough that once\t they\t find\t an\t idea,\t they\t can\t research\t that\t small,\t narrow\t area\t that any invention sits in and they sometimes learn enough to put the data to work. There are thousands of really fantastic inventions that will never see the light of day because the powers controlled by greed will not allow it. To give you a little more data about hypochlorous acid and why it works in the body, let me mention a few more details. How Does Hypochlorous Acid Work? I have mentioned that hypochlorous acid is the main acid used by the immune system to destroy pathogens and other microorganisms unwanted in the body. The mechanism is somewhat different than MMS1 (chlorine dioxide ). MMS1 oxidizes the pathogens directly, pulling away the electrons that hold their molecules together. MMS2"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"115     MMS2 (hypochlorous acid) acts in a different manner. It destroys micro- organisms by carrying oxygen to the microorganism and then the oxygen destroys the organism. Of course, once the hypochlorous acid delivers the oxygen, the destruction is the same. The oxygen pulls off the electrons that hold the pathogen’s skin together. This is the basic idea of the chemical process: 1. The oxygen released by the hypochlorous acid is known as nascent oxygen. That means it is extra active and much more powerful than oxygen normally is, but only for a short period of time. In this case that short period is plenty long enough to do the job. 1. The formula of the hypochlorous acid is HOCl. As the HOCl gets near a pathogen it pulls off a single electron. This electron comes over to the HOCl and destroys it, releasing the oxygen (O), the hydrogen (H), and the chlorine (Cl). The oxygen then destroys the molecule in the pathogen. The hydrogen just becomes part of the body’s water, and the chlorine becomes a chloride, which is table salt. Nature picked this acid for use by the immune system to travel throughout the body and into areas where the oxygen obtained from breathing does not reach. 1. The hypochlorous acid acts as a carrier. It carries the oxygen to places it cannot get to when traveling as oxygen. Traveling in the hypochlorous acid, it is kept separate from various body parts that it could oxidize, and when the hypochlorous acid reaches a hidden pathogen deep in a tissue, it releases the oxygen as mentioned in #2 above, in a nascent condition, to do its job. It is an important mechanism that no pathogen has ever developed a resistance to. Anyone can make MMS2 almost anywhere in the world, as calcium hypochlorite is much more available than the chemical that MMS1 is made from, sodium chlorite. Calcium hypochlorite is sold in most pool stores, and believe it or not, most countries. Even Africa and what we call the developing countries have pool stores. So this chemical is available to almost anyone in the world. It can be used to replace MMS1 in almost every case. Help get the data out. Once people know about this, the ability of the various governments to use diseases as weapons against the people will be nothing."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"116 MMS2 Hypochlorous Acid and Table Salt Here is one more important point that you should know. People worry about being poisoned by MMS2 because it smells and tastes bad. Well, the poison index for MMS2, calcium hypochlorite, is almost the same as for table salt. The actual poison index is 850 mg/kg. That’s the amount that it takes to kill 50% of the rats being tested; the others, lucky for them I guess, live through the test. However in the case of a human being, a real lethal dose would be considered 4 or 5 times that amount. So if you were a human under test and you weighed 80 kg (176 pounds), one would multiply 850 by 80 kg to get the number of milligrams it would take for a 50% chance of a rat-size lethal dose. That is 68 grams and then 4 times that is 272 grams (or 9.5 ounces) for a 50% chance of a human-size lethal dose. Table salt would be about the same. Nine and 1/2 ounces of either one would no doubt kill a grown person. But a little salt shaken on your dinner tonight or a single size zero capsule of calcium hypo- chlorite would be about the same amount, and neither is going to give you a problem.

Eventually\t I\t and\t several\t of\t my\t friends\t were\t able\t to\t overcome\t the\t flu\t taking MMS3. I believe that MMS3 is even more effective than either MMS 1 or MMS 2. I only list this research here so it is in book form, in thousands of books that is, and thus if something happened to me it would still be known. The reason is that both of these minerals are chemicals that the body can make naturally. They each do a slightly different job. They are both oxidizers , though with different oxidation potentials. So one would assume that the two working together could be more effective than just one of them working alone. How I made MMS3 I obtained a bag of pool chlorine ; that’s calcium hypochlorite . The bag was two pounds and it was 70% calcium hypochlorite. That is the only chemical that works. •\t Don’t use any other pool chlorine. Don’t, absolutely don’t use sodium hypochlorite.

MMS works fast, usually healing animals of diseases within hours or days. It works tens of times faster than any other disease medicine. I have seen horses cured of extremely bad colds in less than 30 minutes. I know everyone seems to balk at the word “cure” since medical drug corporations have convinced most everyone that diseases cannot be cured. Actually, it is not correct to say MMS cures anything because it doesn’t. The only thing that cures is the body, the healing mechanisms of nature in the body. MMS just provides the immune system with tools to kill the microorganisms that are present. The body then makes an amazing recovery in most cases, and this is true of both people and animals. A Doggie Tale My friend once had a small dog, a mutt. It was bitten by a rattle snake and he was sure that the dog would die. We gave it two activated drops of MMS every 15 minutes in a small amount of water. The dog took one sniff of the water and drank it right down each time. It seemed to be able to tell from the sniff that it would be good for him. After a while it was peeing and it began to feel better in about an hour. After a while, it couldn’t drink as much and in about 4 hours the swelling was mostly gone. It was OK the next day."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"124 Healing Animals No Need to Supplement MMS Animals respond to MMS much the way people do. I don’t believe that there is a single condition or disease that MMS cannot help overcome in both people and animals. There are now some health specialists and doctors who talk about MMS being pretty good but that it needs to be used with different kinds of drugs or other health herbs or chemicals. They say, “Yes, yes, MMS is really good in certain instances and I am going to add it to my list of things to use.” Well, they really aren’t helping either the MMS cause or the animal problems. The fact is, you can replace every single medicine that you have with MMS. Keep the nutritional stuff, but MMS replaces all the other drugs and potions and medicines. Of course, there are other things that can be used, and there will no doubt be other miracle treatments in the future. I might be wrong about completely replacing everything else, but don’t think of MMS as a helper to other drugs. It is so far above drugs that it really cannot be compared. It’s like comparing apples and walnuts. They do not do the same job in the body. I’ve treated quite a few animals successfully. The owners and other people told me the names of the diseases. But I have enough problems remembering people diseases and I never really considered the names much. I just treated the animals according to how sick they were. •\t For a bad sickness, I used the hourly doses; •\t For less severe sickness, I used two or three doses a day; •\t For really bad diseases like cancer where an animal is about to die, I added MMS2 to the protocol and used Protocol 2000. Treating animals deserves a full book written about it with complete data on the diseases and their names. I don’t have room here, nor do I have the time, as that for me would take many months. Still, if you follow the directions here you will be able to handle most animal problems if you also understand animals. Treating Animal Diseases There are two basic ways to dose animals. “Plan A” – dose the animal twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening using MMS1 or 2 as given below. That will handle"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"125 Healing Animals most of the sickness problems for animals of all kinds. Plan B is for killing virus-caused diseases. It is much more intense, but it has been successful almost every time. I don’t remember a time when it didn’t work. But there have been those who did it wrong, and then it didn’t work. It calls for hourly MMS doses for at least 8 hours each day. Plan A Normally my suggestion for someone who is getting sick would be to give a 4- to 6-drop dose, wait one hour, and then give another similar dose, doing this so they can go to sleep after the second dose . Now remember, for animals we are talking about 2 drops for each 50 lb or 25 kg of body weight. So if the animal weighs 200 pounds, that’s an 8-drop dose, and if it weighs 25 pounds, that’s a one-drop dose. In kilograms that would be a one-drop dose for each 11 kg. •\t Add 5 drops of 10% citric acid for each drop of MMS-1 that you are using and wait 3 minutes; OR •\t Add one drop of 50% citric acid for each drop of MMS-1 and wait only 20 seconds. Then add the water, 2 ounces for each drop of MMS used. For everyday sicknesses caused by bacteria rather than viruses, you can use 2 doses a day and that will usually take care of things. If the animal doesn’t seem to be getting better in 2 or 3 days, you must assume that the problem is caused by a virus or other microorgan - ism stronger than bacteria. In that case, go to Plan B . If the animal is so sick that it is lying down, you will need to get the solution into them one way or another. A tube into the throat from a water bottle or even into the rectum might do the job. Or if you could get your Vet to do the job according to these instructions, that would probably\t be\t the\t best.\t Some\t of\t them\t don’t\t want\t to\t do\t it\t at\t first,\t but\t they usually come around. If you are going to try MMS2 instead of MMS1, use one size zero capsule for each 150 lbs. (70 kg) of body weight. Give that dose once, wait for 2 hours and then give a second dose the same size. Do it again the next morning and evening. Try for a day or two more twice a day. That should heal most animals but if they are not well very\tsoon,\tgo\tto\tplan\tB\t(for\tviruses\tand\tmore\tdifficult\tdiseases)."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 Healing Animals Plan B (Difficult Diseases) Diseases caused by viruses \t require\t a\t continuous\t flow\t of\t doses\t for\t a\t consistent period of time each day. Basically a dose of MMS1 every hour, and MMS2 every two hours for a period of at least 8 hours is\t what\t is\t needed,\t but\t 10\t or\t 12\t hours\t is\t even\t better.\t Colds\t and\t flu\t are normally caused by viruses and thus you will need to treat your animal hourly for a day or two, or maybe even longer. HIV/AIDS in people requires a dose each hour for 8 hours a day, for 3 weeks. No doubt animals will have diseases that require similar treatment.\t Colds\t and\t flu\t are\t usually\t handled\t in\t the\t first\t day,\t if\t not\t the\t first\t couple\t days.\t Colds\t are\t usually\t caused\t by\t a\t virus\t and\t thus\t sometimes require the more intense treatment if they are settled in. But I have always found that animals heal faster than humans and thus when you see the animal looking well, normally you can assume it is well. The reason for the hourly treatment is given in Chapter 13 in Protocols 1000 and 2000. But let me say that it takes several hours of contact with MMS to kill viruses. So any viral infection will require hourly treatment and for how long depends on the power of the virus. Most will be handled in several days\t or\t the\t first\t day,\t but\t really\t serious\t stuff\t might\t take\t a\t week\t or\t two.\t Cancer can take longer. Normally you will never give your animal more than one drop of MMS1 for each increment (50 pounds or 25 kg) of body weight. But that is each hour for 8 hours a day. If the animal is extra sick, you will need to go ahead and add the capsules of MMS2. So you can see this is slightly different than the people treatment. I am suggesting using MMS1 hourly and only going to MMS2 when it seems the animal is really sick. Any animal that is very sick, lying down, or has cancer or other life- threatening conditions really needs the hourly treatment. If it causes them to be sicker, then reduce the dose to a half drop per 2 hours, or even a quarter drop per 2 hours (per 50 pounds or 25 kg of their body weight), but usually they will be able to take the one drop per hour per 50 lbs. of body weight. If they have cancer and other bad things, add the MMS2 at one capsule every other hour. In this case you will be doing both MMS1 and 2. Keep this up until the animal is well. In the case of cancer, you will need to use even more than one drop"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"127 Healing Animals for each increment of body weight. Use as much as you can but don’t make the animal sicker. If the animal gets sicker, stop until it is back where it was when you started and then start again with a smaller amount. Dosing Animals Calculating the right dose is crucial so please be careful. This paragraph covers dosing of animals from the size of an elephant to the size of a rat. We divide the animal up into 50 pound parts (25 kg).\t Then\t we\t figure\t how\t many\t drops\t to\t give\t the\t animal\t for\t each\t 50\t pound increment of its weight. For example, if the animal weighs 100 pounds and we are going to give it a 2drop dose, it will get 4 drops. That’s 2 drops for each 50 pound increment of body weight. •\t If\t a\t cow\t weighed\t 500\t pounds,\t that\t would\t be\t 10\t fifty-pound\t increments.\t If\t it\t were\t given\t a\t 2-drop\t dose,\t figure\t that\t 2\t times\t 10 would be 20 drops that this animal would actually get. I hope that’s clear. If I say, “Give a 500 pound horse a 3 drop dose”, you would be giving the horse 30 drops. Of course if an animal weighed 25 pounds, that is one half of an increment, so if you were giving a 2-drop dose, it would only get one drop. Remember all these drops must be activated. See below. Using MMS1 with Animals For dosing animals , we are always talking about using MMS1 in the form that is currently sold. That is 22.4% sodium chlorite . Don’t be fooled by the bottle saying 28% sodium chlorite powder. That is true, but the powder is only 80% sodium chlorite. Eighty percent of 28% is 22.4%. When using MMS1, always make sure that it is activated with either citric acid or (in a pinch) vinegar . Use 5 drops of 10% citric acid per drop of MMS1. Other acids can be used, but most of the technology has been developed with a 10% solution of citric acid or a 50% solution of citric acid which is more concentrated and easier to use – just one drop for each drop of MMS1. You can buy citric acid in 50 pound sacks (25 kg sacks) and it is very cheap. MMS1 is always activated. Thus, when I say “2 drops of MMS1”, you will always know that you must activate each drop with either 5 drops of 10% citric acid or one drop of 50% citric acid. See Chapter 12, General Procedural Information for more about making MMS."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"128 Healing Animals Be Sure to Add Water You must absolutely add water to MMS1 before it is given to any person or animal. Add at least one ounce for each drop of MMS used. That does not mean each weight increment. For every drop of activated MMS, after the three minutes or 20-second wait, add one ounce of water. That’s about an eighth of a cup of water for each drop of MMS. •\t In the example of the cow that weighed 500 pounds and you used 10 drops of MMS1 for a one-drop dose, you would use 10 ounces of water (1 ounce (an eighth of a glass) times 10). Now once the water is added, you can feed it to your sick animal. After the MMS goes down, allow the animal to drink all it wants. It doesn’t matter if what is in the animal’s stomach is diluted a little bit or a lot. All the MMS chemicals will still be in the animal’s body and will be just as effective. Using MMS2 with Animals It is not necessary to activate MMS2. I don’t think you will ever be able to sprinkle some MMS2 on the animal’s feed, but I don’t know that for sure. Give it a try; it might work. Maybe some of them will enjoy the aided digestion. For the most part, you will need to push the MMS2 capsules down their throat and then give them a bit of water, or they will be sorry and you will too. One capsule requires at least a cup of water. Just push the capsule down their throat, slop some water down immediately and then get some more water down to equal at least one cup per capsule. I have never been able to determine which is more powerful, MMS1 or MMS2. They both seem to get fantastic results. But, of course, we have had years more technology experience with MMS1. Use one capsule size zero for each 200 pounds of body weight. Remember if the animal weighs 100 pounds, that would be half a capsule. Open the capsule and empty half of it and put the lid back on or make up some half-full capsules. Since all of our technology has always used size zero capsules, let me suggest that you do too. Then you can follow my suggestions here without trying to work out the problem of how much to use. Just buy the calcium hypochlorite at a pool store according to the instruc- tions\t I\t have\t given\t above\t in\t this\t chapter.\t Then\t fill\t the\t capsules\t by\t"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"129 Healing Animals hand. You can buy a capsule machine for $100 or so at a health food store, but most people just put the powder or granules in a bowl, hold\t the\t capsule\t in\t their\t fingers,\t and\t dip\t fingers\t and\t all\t into\t the\t bowl.\t Don’t\t tamp\t the\t granules \tdown.\t Just\t fill\t them.\t It’s\t fast.\t Tight\t fitting\t latex\tgloves\tfor\tyour\tfingers\twould\tbe\tbest\tfor\tfilling\tthe\tcapsules. So if your animal is looking a little bad or doesn’t eat or has no energy or any one of a hundred other negative indications, give it a few doses of MMS2. When calculating the number of capsules for the animal, get a good estimation of its weight and then use a standard dose of one capsule for each 200 pounds of the animal’s weight. If you caught the animal when it was just starting to get sick, you can often just sprinkle several capsules on their food or for dogs and cats sometimes you can put it in some beef or chicken broth and they will usually wolf it right down. Generally I have always used MMS1 with dogs and cats, but I am sure MMS2 would work. Use much less than a full capsule with a cat or dog, since they weigh less than 100 pounds, especially cats. About Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea This is very important. Some animals cannot vomit, so you must be extra careful not to make them sicker than they already are. When dosed correctly, MMS makes people and animals better, not worse. If your animal is taking MMS and it appears to be getting sicker, then you are probably giving it too much. Getting sicker with MMS is a sign of progress, but progress that’s too fast for the animal’s body, so you must immediately reduce the doses. If the animal gets diarrhea, stop the doses altogether until the diarrhea stops. Then start them again, but at a reduced dose. That is also true for vomiting and for nausea . Stop MMS until the animal is back to the condition you are treating, and then start again. MMS only causes sickness because it kills the bacteria or viruses too fast and they are dumping too much poison into the body. Slow your treatment down in that case. Allowing diarrhea, vomiting or nausea to continue does not help the animal. In fact, it can kill the animal. See Chapter 15, Signs That MMS is Working . Using MMS 1 on the Skin There are thousands of different kinds of rashes, cancers, sores, and diseases of the skin that MMS1 and 2 can overcome in two or"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"130 Healing Animals three days to a week. I always use a much stronger MMS1 spray for the skin than for the mouth. •\t Use 10 drops of MMS1 per ounce of water and the appropriate amount of citric acid activator in a 4 ounce spray bottle. Chapter 12 gives more details on how to make an MMS1 dose. Be sure the 10 drops of MMS1 are activated. But two ounces isn’t much. My suggestion for an animal spray bottle would be a one-quart bottle at least, or 1000 ml. In an empty one-quart bottle, put 4 teaspoons of MMS1. That would be 80 drops per teaspoon or 320 drops of MMS1 for a quart bottle or 1000 ml. Then add the same amount of 50% citric acid, or 5 times that amount of\t 10%\t citric\t acid.\t Wait\t the\t 20\t seconds\t or\t the\t 3\t minutes\t and\t fill\t the\t bottle with water. That will last about 5 days. Now that you have that spray, you can spray all the sores and rashes, and diseases that your animals have anywhere on the skin or face. Once a day might not be enough. Some diseases require spray on the skin, but also taking by mouth. Most skin problems require that you spray three or four times a day, sometimes hourly. Anytime an animal is wounded, spray directly into the wound. Do that for yourself as well. •\t MMS1 or MMS2 applied to an open wound will help coagulate the blood and stop the bleeding and totally prevent infection. Using MMS 2 on the Skin You can also use MMS2 for all the same things, and it might be slightly\t more\t efficient\t for\t spraying\t wounds,\t as\t it\t has\t been\t proven\t that wounds sterilized by MMS2 (calcium hypochlorite ) heal faster than others. That is because MMS2 does not damage the open tissues and cells (also true of MMS1). This has been recorded on the internet by researchers who were not aware of MMS. They were researching calcium hypochlorite. You could\t find\t them\t on\t the\t internet\t if\t you\t were\t to\t search\t “calcium\t hypo - chlorite for use on wounds” or something like that. I have to be careful about their copyright and don’t have time to get their permission for this book. So I won’t say any more. •\t When spraying the skin with MMS2, don’t bother with the capsules. Just use one teaspoon in one glass of water (8 ounces). If you don’t smell chlorine , you can assume it has"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"131 Healing Animals lost its strength. (But don’t worry, it’s not chlorine. It is hypo- chlorous acid). Infection in an Animal’s Eyes Make a 4-drop dose of MMS1 diluted in half a glass of water and use that in a spray bottle to spray the eye. The animal will shut its eyes so it might be best to use a drop bottle and drop it in the eye and then\t use\t your\t finger\t to\t move\t the\t eye\t skin to sort of work it in. That should clear up most problems, but if the eye infection continues after several days, double the strength of the spray and do it again. MMS\t spray\t will\t not\t kill\t fleas . Sorry, they are too tough. That is the same reason it will not hurt the human body or animal bodies. Chlorine dioxide as used with humans and animals kills pathogens but cannot kill\t fleas\t and\t other\t bugs\t because\t it\t is\t not\t strong\t enough.\t It\t is\t a\t weak\t oxidizer. You can spray into the ears with the full strength skin spray as given above. It kills parasites but only micro-size parasite . I don’t know what size parasites it will kill. It kills all parasite diseases, but large tick-size parasites will probably not be affected. Aztec Clay for Fungus Problems There are some fungi that do not respond to MMS1 but will respond to MMS2. But much worse, you would think, there are some fungi that will not respond to either MMS1 or 2 and they will even get worse when treated with MMS. Luckily there is another Master Mineral that will handle these fungi. •\t It’s the same with people as with animals. When you notice that a rash or cancerous growth gets worse when treated with MMS1 and it does not respond to MMS2, don’t wait -- find\t some\t Aztec\t clay at the nearest health food store. Commercially it is known as Bentonite but is sold in many places in Europe as Montmorrilonite. As Bentonite, it is used for oil well drilling. This clay has billions of tiny holes with an electrical charge that draws fungi and other microorganisms into the holes and then they cannot get back out. You could buy enough bentonite for a whole herd of cows for about $50. Other than this special fungus, MMS makes things get better fast. If something on the skin doesn’t get better right away (within a day or two) it has to be that one type of fungus that does not respond to MMS."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"132 Healing Animals Just remember: •\t MMS makes things better. If MMS doesn’t make it better, you are either using MMS wrong, like not activating it, or (more commonly) using too much; or you have a fungus problem. Buy some Bentonite , mix it with 50% Vaseline, and cover the area extra thick. The fungus should be gone in 2 or 3 days. Keep replacing the mixture on the fungus every 3 or 4 hours. It helps if you hold the mixture in place with a bandage of some kind. Maintenance Doses for Animals Below is a suggested maintenance dose for any animal that drinks about 2% of its body weight in water each day. It would be the equivalent of a 5-drop dose for a human being each day. If the animal drinks more water, it will get a slightly bigger dose. It’s sort of self regulating. The\t first\t thing\t to\t know\t is\t that\t their\t drinking\t water\t should\t always\t contain either MMS1 or MMS2 . If your animals are getting sick, you are not using enough MMS unless something unusual is happening. •\t For drinking water that sits available all day, MMS1 does not need to be activated because the water will do that over a few hours. •\t However, if you are going to water a number of animals that will drink it right away, you will have to activate the MMS1 with lemon juice, lime juice, or citric acid. Other acids work pretty well, as does vinegar . MMS 2 does not need to be activated. Maintenance Dose Steps Step 1: Use about one drop of MMS1 per gallon of distilled water . Any other water will take slightly more or a whole lot more depending upon the water. The clearer the water, the less MMS1 will be needed. Turbid water might need up to 5 drops per gallon. Step 2: Use about one level teaspoon of MMS2 (calcium hypochlo - rite) per 5 gallons of water. Step 3: Go to the internet and buy chlorine dioxide indicator strips. You are looking for a 2 ppm (parts per million) indication on the strips. •\t These strips indicate any kind of oxidizers , not just chlorine , so don’t worry. In your case they are indicating hypochlorous acid for MMS 2. That’s the chemistry of it. The color of the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"133 Healing Animals indication on the strip will be different for hypochlorous acid, but it will still indicate the presence or absence of an oxidizer and that is what you want. Step 4: When you put either MMS1 or MMS2 in the water, some of it will be used up immediately, killing the bacteria and other microor- ganisms and destroying other impurities. It could all be used up, so always wait for several hours before measuring for ppm. You’ll want to make sure it is mixed and has not been used up immediately by oxidizing pathogens and other things. If necessary, continue adding MMS until you get an indication of 2 to 4 ppm. That’s enough. That will be plenty for maintenance of dogs, cats, chickens and most of the other animals. However each situation is different. If your animals are not really healthy, they may have diarrhea or other reactions \tat\t first,\t but\t they\t should\t feel\t better\t very\t soon. Step 5: Keep a record of exactly how much you add each time. You may\t want\t to\t start\t out\t at\t less\t than\t 4\t ppm\t at\t first.\t The\t same\t reading\t is\t needed whether you use MMS1 or MMS2. If there is some disease going around or other problems you may want to increase the ppm up to 10 ppm or more. You should buy MMS1 either in powder form or in the concentrated liquid form. In any case, keep in mind that: •\t MMS1 sold in the bottles for human use was made with 28% powder sodium chlorite, but that powder is only 80% sodium chlorite . Therefore MMS in the bottle is only 22.4% sodium chlorite. Each drop has 12 mg of sodium chlorite in it. Normally it comes in 50 kg steel barrels. Five and a half ounces of MMS1 in the bottle contains 1.54 ounces of the 80% powder, or only 1.23 ounces of pure sodium chlorite. Each gram of liquid in the bottle has 280 milligrams of the 80% powder that you buy or 224 milligrams of pure sodium chlorite. Buying MMS2 MMS2 is calcium hypochlorite and it is easy to get at most pool stores and department stores that have pool supplies. It comes in containers of all sizes from 1 kg (2 pounds) to 50 kg (100 pounds). All of the containers give the percentage of calcium hypochlorite. Try not to buy anything less than 68% calcium hypochlorite. The"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"134 Healing Animals reason for this is that the powders with lower percentages of calcium hypochlorite are lower percentage because they have added stabilizers\t or\t clarifiers.\t Although\t these\t chemicals\t don’t\t really\t hurt;\t they are just that much more junk in the water that is not needed. You\t can\t usually\t find\t high\tquality\t (up\t to\t 80%\t or\t more)\t calcium\t hypo - chlorite,\t but\t the\t 68%\t will\tdo,\t and\t in\t a\t pinch,\t if\t you\t can’t\t find\t anything\t else, the 45% or 55% or 60% would work. I keep saying that MMS doesn’t cure anything. It destroys the pathogens that are creating poisons that cause the disease. The body’s immune system uses the chemicals in MMS1 and MMS2 same as it has been doing for millions of years. We only give it some more of these chemicals and then the body does all the healing. The millions of chemical mixes and electronic impulses of the body do the healing. What I have told you so far has saved thousands of dollars a year for a few large animal owners, and hopefully this book will make it many more. Those whom I have heard from or heard about have been very happy with their results. Good luck with your animals. #####"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"135 Making MMS in Your Kitchen Making MMS in Your Kitchen Making 2-Ounce or 4-Ounce Bottles of MMS A s discussed earlier, MMS is made from powdered sodium chlorite, referred to in this chapter as “salts” or NaClO 2 , the chemical formula. Be careful, because we still get people who mistake sodium chlorite for sodium chloride (table salt). They sound similar, but they are quite different, so only use sodium chlorite. The following process can be used to produce 13 bottles, or duplicated to produce hundreds or thousands of bottles. Making 2- or 4-ounce Bottles of MMS Please do everything exactly as I say. Once you have bottled 300 to 500 bottles, then, if you must, modify the process to suit yourself.

If you use your own bottles, please label them so that people will know what is inside and how to use it. Several years from now, your bottle may be sitting on a shelf and a sick person will look at it. If it has a label on it, he will know how to use it and it may save his life. Note: The MMS 4-ounce bottle actually weighs 5.5 ounces, because MMS is heavier than water. Note: MMS can also be made from liquid solutions of NaClO 2 when you\tcannot\tfind\tthe\tpowdered\tform.

In that case, you will need to furnish an eye dropper with each bottle as you cannot squeeze the bottle to get out drops. Plastic bottles are best for shipping because of their light weight. However, there is one type of safe plastic bottle. Plastic bottles are numbered on the bottom with a number inside of a triangle. These are EPA recycling codes and the number tells the quality of the bottle and quality of the plastic. Plastic bottles with the number 2 are acceptable for bottling MMS. They are made of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and do not leach chemicals into their contents. If you cannot obtain HDPE bottles, use number 1 bottles, called PET bottles (polyethylene terephthalate). \t Thirteen flip-spout caps that fit the bottles. Or use drop - per top bottles See information on ordering bottles at the end of this chapter. In any case, you need some kind of bottle that will provide drops as that’s all that anyone will be using these bottles for. \t Several tubes of super glue for gluing the lids on the MMS bottles \t A can of 3M Super 77 Multipurpose Adhesive bought from a hardware store for about $10 Do not buy any other 3M adhesive. If you do, you will just make a mess and waste some bottles. Some art supply stores sell spray adhesive. You need a good adhesive for gluing the labels on the bottles. \t A can of shellac or clear plastic coating This is for spraying the labels to prevent problems in damp envi- ronments. If you don’t shellac the labels, in a few days or weeks the bottles will become a mess. Spray the labels before they are cut out. Or just order your labels from a printing store that handles labels. \t A cardboard box approximately 2 feet high Cut\t a\t slit\t in\t the\t top\t of\t the\t box\t so\t that\t the\t MMS\t bottle\t will\t fit\t in\t"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"138 Making MMS in Your Kitchen it, but not fall through. Put a mark on the box indicating where the top of the label will stick onto the bottle. This will help you determine where to put the labels on the bottles, so most of them will be in approximately the same area on the bottles. \t Bottle labels Make eight labels at a time on a computer using letter size paper (8-1/2 X 11) and cut them out with a razor knife or a straight edge. Then spray six labels at a time and stick them on the bottles. It is very\t hard\t to\t find\t the\t right\t labels,\t such\t that\t your\t computer\t will\t be\t able to print exactly in the center of each label. It’s much easier to just print eight labels on a page and cut them out with a razor knife. Buy special paper for the labels. Get glossy paper from an office\tsupply\tstore,\tor\torder\tspecial\tlabels. \t A box of one-quart Ziploc freezer bags \t One fairly accurate gram scale Don’t use a cheap spring postal scale. Use a more expensive electronic postal scale or some other accurate scale. It should be accurate to a tenth of a gram. \t Sodium chlorite You will need 1.54 ounces of sodium chlorite for each 4-ounce bottle of MMS you will make. Remember that the solution in a 4 ounce bottle will weigh 5.5 ounces, because MMS is heavier than water. If you are going to make a quart of MMS you will need 12.32 ounces of NaClO 2 . If you are going to make a liter of MMS, you will need 280 grams of NaClO 2 . If you are going to make more, just multiply times the figures\tgiven\there. \t A black marking pen Be sure to have one on hand. The Procedure MMS is 28% salts by weight. The salts are a powder that is dissolved in distilled water, so keep in mind that the MMS will be 28% salts. This is what makes it so much heavier than water. Do not make a mistake here. People’s lives depend upon it. Just follow the instruc- tions below and you will get it right. It is also possible to buy the NaClO 2 in liquid form. In that case, it will"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"139 Making MMS in Your Kitchen be something like 25%, 30%, or 31% NaClO 2 and you will need to dilute it with water to obtain a 22.4% solution. See more data at the end of this chapter. Step 1: Decide how much MMS you want to make at one time. In order to use this procedure, you will need to work with the weight of the water rather than quarts or gallons. So in order to make a gallon or a quart of MMS you will have to know the weight of the water or you will have to measure it with your scales. Step 2: So let’s decide on making 10 pounds of MMS. Remember MMS is highly alkaline before it is activated and thus you must not use\t any\t kind\t of\t metal\t pots\t or\t pans.\t Teflon\t coated\t pans,\t Corning\t Ware, glass, or other ceramic ware is OK. \t ◊ Once MMS has been activated, and has been diluted, it is neutral and thus cannot harm any metal medical components in a human body. Step 3: \t\t Measure\t out\t 10\t pounds\t of\t distilled\t water\t or\t purified\t water\t and put it into a non-metal pot. Put the pot on your scales and tare out its weight so that you are measuring ten pounds of water and not the pot. Now we know that we want to wind up with 10 pounds of MMS. And we know that MMS is 28% NaClO 2 powder . •\t Remember that it is powder. That powder is only 22.4% NaClO 2 because you cannot buy 100% powder. It’s all 80% NaClO 2 . We must put 28% powder into our water in order to wind up with 22.4% NaClO 2 in the water. But we can’t put the powder into the water yet because the water already weighs 10 pounds. So we must remove 28% of the water and replace it with 28% NaClO 2 . That’s 2.8 lbs. or 44.8 ounces or 1270.08 grams of water to remove and then we put exactly 2.8 lbs. of NaClO 2 powder back into the water. Using Kilograms: You should be able to do the same thing in Kg. If you\t use\t 5\t Kg\t of\t water\t it\t would\t be\t a\t little\t more\t MMS,\t but\t the\t figures\t would come out right. Just remove 28% of the water (which would be 1.4 kg) and replace it with 1.4 kg of NaClO 2 . Read the above paragraph for details. Step 4: Put this pot on the stove and stir the solution until dissolved. Do not boil it or allow it to get hotter than 160 degrees F. Remove"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"140 Making MMS in Your Kitchen the pot from the stove and allow cooling before putting it into bottles. Remember the bottles must be dark glass or opaque plastic. In an emergency, it would be OK to store the MMS in clear glass and sit it in a dark place for up to a week. If you do not have a stove or you are some place in Africa where there is no stove, don’t worry. It is not absolutely necessary to heat the solution. Just let it sit for at least 12 hours after the NaClO 2 has dissolved. It will go clear instead of foggy and it will be OK. Warning MMS IS DANGEROUS . Never allow the MMS to sit on the table or in an open pot on the table unless it has been put in colored bottles and labeled. The MMS quickly changes to look like pure water. It has no smell. A couple of people have drunk more than half a glass before realizing it wasn’t water. They spent more than 3 weeks in the hospital. If it should happen to you, drink plenty of water and allow yourself to vomit and drink more water. •\t Keep in mind that if the MMS spills, it will make a mess. If it dries, it will make a white powder that will burn or explode. There won’t be enough to cause a large explosion, but if it starts\t a\t fire,\t there\t could\t be\t a\t lot\t of\t damage.\t Do not spill the MMS. If you spill it, wipe it up immediately and then wash the spot with plenty of water. Step 5: Using the black marker pen, write “MMS” on the bottle, along with the date it was created. Leave room for the next time you use the bottle. Remember, you cannot leave the MMS in the clear bottle for very long -- generally not longer than one week. Light, even just room light, will begin to deteriorate the solution in the bottles. This is just an intermediate step in the process of making MMS. You could keep this bottle for years if you kept it in a completely closed, no-light closet or refrigerator. Be sure to write MMS on the bottle, and put a lid on it immediately. Note: Do not put labels on empty bottles. Wait until the bottles are full and closed before attaching labels, because any spilled solution will ruin the labels. Bottling the MMS Step 1: \t\t Take\t the\t bottle\t filled\t with\t MMS\t and\t open\t it . Pour enough MMS into the plastic pitcher with the small spout, or the coffee maker"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"141 Making MMS in Your Kitchen pot,\t to\t fill\t about\t five\t MMS\t bottles.\t Don’t\t measure\t this;\t just\t pour\t it\t a\t quarter full or so. •\t Alternatively, pour the contents of MMS bottles that you have into\t the\t water\t jug\t described\t earlier.\t Use\t the\t spigot\t to\t fill\t 12\t to 20 bottles. It’s best not to have more than that number of bottles open at one time. Step 2: Install tops on each of the 4-ounce MMS bottles. Do this by holding each cap on its side and dropping 2 drops of super glue onto its threads. Then turn the cap onto the bottle. Tighten it by hand as tightly as you can using something like a towel to help you grip it. After an hour, the caps should be impossible to remove by hand. A towel works best; do not use pliers. Caps closed using pliers are usually too tight and eventually the bottle begins to leak. Step 3: After the cap has been tightened , grasp the bottle in your hand, turn it upside down and squeeze it as hard as you can. Look for leaks. If there is a leak, drops of liquid will generally fall off the bottle.\t In\t rare\t cases,\t a\t fine\t spray\t or\t stream\t might\t come\t out\t of\t the\t bottom\t of\t the\t bottle.\t You\t will\t need\t plenty\t of\t light\t to\t see\t the\t fine\t spray. Normally, there will only be one or two leaking bottles per 100 bottles,\t but\t it\t is\t important\t that\t you\t find\t any\t leaks,\t as\t one\t bottle\t can\t foul an entire shipment. Step 4: Keep the bottles in a clean dry place. It is okay to keep them in normal room light if they are made of colored but clear plastic, but do not allow them to sit in the sunlight. Step 5: Attach the labels. (See Making the Labels below.) Take six labels and lay them face down on a sheet of newspaper. Spray them with 3M Super 77 adhesive. Don’t attempt to do more than six at a time, as the adhesive tends to dry quickly and if you do more than six, the last labels will be too dry to stick. If they do dry, re-spray those that have dried before attempting to stick them on the bottles. Step 6: \t\t Place\t one\t of\t the\t filled\t bottles\t in\t the\t slit\t on\t the\t cardboard\t box\t that you have already prepared. (See item #10 under “What You Will Need” at the beginning of these instructions.) Pick up a single label that has been sprayed with adhesive, hold it over the bottle near the mark that you have made, adjust it by eye until it is straight, and then press it down on the bottle. Smooth it out with your hand. Be sure to smooth\tit\tdown\tfirmly.\t Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 until all of the bottles have labels."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"142 Making MMS in Your Kitchen Step 8: Prepare the bottles to be shipped. Place two MMS bottles in a one-quart plastic freezer storage bag, laying them down in the bottom of the bag. Wrap the top of the bag around the two bottles, seal the zip lock, making sure it is tight, and place a rubber band around the bag and bottles to hold them in place. Now put the bottles in the bag into another bag and close it. If the bottles leak in shipment, the liquid will hopefully remain in one of the bags. Step 9: Repeat step 8 until all bottles to be shipped are ready. This will prevent problems with leaking bottles during shipping. A single leaking bottle can cancel an entire shipment, preventing the treatment of hundreds of people. It could even result in the post office\trejecting\tfuture\tshipments,\tso\tplease\tbe\tvery\tcareful.\t Step 10: Have the bagged bottles boxed for shipping . Unless you are very good at boxing items for shipping, do not try to do it yourself. Keep in mind this shipment is of utmost importance. Don’t take chances. When you go to the packing store, don’t take chances by saving money on the packaging. Have the bottles boxed as carefully as possible. From the packing store, take the box to FedEx or DHL for shipping. Making the Labels Step 1: Most computer drawing programs have provisions for making labels. If you do not have a drawing program available, you can buy a cheap label program. You can use the program to set up a single label, as shown later in this chapter, and then the program will automatically make copies, depending upon the number of labels you select. In this case, select a layout that has the correct size for the bottles you are using. This will produce labels that are approxi - mately the correct size when cut out. Or you can duplicate the label given below. Step 2: Buy good paper. Pay $8 to $10 a ream, but don’t use photo paper. It is very expensive and is not suitable, as it is too thick. Buy special glossy paper of standard thickness or slightly thinner at any office\t supply\t store\t and\t print\t the\t labels\t on\t a\t computer.\t After\t the\t computer ink has dried and before you cut them out, spray them with shellac until they are soaked, but spray them only once. Step 3: Cut the labels out with a razor knife using a ruler as a straight edge. Do not apply the adhesive until after you cut out the labels. Alternatively, you could have them printed professionally."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"143 Making MMS in Your Kitchen Master Mineral Solution Water Purification Drops For\tabsolutely\tpurified\twater\tor\t juice, the MMS in this bottle must be mixed with citric acid.

You cannot leave an eye dropper in the bottle as the MMS will cause the rubber to deteriorate. When searching for plastic bottles, the best type for use with MMS is the #2 HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) bottles. Use them if at all possible as they do not leach chemicals into the MMS. They are available online and in some countries and are white opaque plastic. But\t if\t you\t have\t trouble\t finding\t HDPE\t bottles,\t use\t a\t PET\tplastic.\t PET\t stands for Polyethylene Terephthalate, but no one ever uses the full name. Be sure to always buy dark clear plastic, or opaque white or colored plastic PET bottles, as clear light plastic will cause the solution to deteriorate. The plastic can be transparent, so long as it is very dark. •\t For our own use in the Dominican Republic, and for class supplies, we have used number 2 bottles. However, although they are reliable for citric acid, some of them have cracked after holding MMS for a few weeks. We would like to hear from anyone using number 2 bottles, as to whether they have done the job well or not. Please contact us at http://miraclem- ineral.org / using the “Contact Us” link in the top navigation. Buying Large Amounts of Sodium Chlorite Sodium chlorite (NaClO 2 ) comes in 100-pound and 110-pound steel barrels. If you want to make a larger batch, like one hundred 4-ounce bottles to sell and give to your family and neighbors, you will need at least 10 pounds of NaClO 2 . As you will see from the prices, buying a 100-pound barrel will cost you less than buying 10 pounds. The problem is, as a general rule, you will need a company to buy a 100-pound barrel. However, some of the companies listed on the internet will sell to individuals. Of course, you can create your own company. That will work in many cases, but some sources will require your company’s state or city\t resale\t number.\t You\t might\t be\t able\t to\t find\t a\t local\t business\t that\t will receive the NaClO 2 for you and let you use their name for this purpose or just order it for you. Alternatively, you could buy a resale number from your city. Finding industrial sources for 100-pound drums is a little harder than buying lab supplies. Go to Google and search on “drinking water chemicals in [your country]” or “drinking water treatment chemicals in [your country]”.

This is an association through which many companies sell NaClO 2 .\t You\t will\t find\t companies\t selling\t NaClO 2 this way that you\twon’t\tfind\tany\tother\tway. Then just start calling the companies that sell NaClO 2 for water puri- fication.\t You\t will\t eventually\t find\t one\t that\t will\t sell\t you\t the\t 100-pound\t barrel, and it will cost between $250 and $400. The shipping will cost you an additional $150 or so, because it is a hazardous chemical. Or alternately you could drive to pick up the barrel, but it would be best to have it shipped. They might suspect something if you drive, unless you have a good story. Somebody once asked me wouldn’t I feel that it is an ethical violation to lie in order to buy sodium chlorite. I thought it was a crazy question. The governments of USA, Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand and a number of others have all lied trying to stop MMS. In my opinion, it is more stupid to hang on to a useless truth in order to prove some sort of an ideal than it is to always think the government is right. So far, every barrel of sodium chlorite bought anywhere in the world has resulted in lives saved. And no, I do not think it is wrong to tell a story in order to buy the sodium chlorite. My Church believes in always doing what is right, but it does not say we cannot think for ourselves. •\t With a 100-pound barrel you can make 488,250 doses. That is less than a tenth of a cent per dose, depending on the price of the barrel. It could handle more than 100,000 cases of malaria. As a last minute decision, on my way south after the release of the first\t MMS\t book,\t I\t managed\t to\t buy\t a\t 100-pound\t barrel\t of\t NaClO 2 from the Los Angeles Chemical Company of Los Angeles, California for a price of $278.00, the lowest price so far. They will not sell to an individual – you must be registered with them as a company. So I formed a small company in a Nevada town and then called them to order a barrel. They put my company in their database when I called them. They then ordered the barrel for me and said it would be available at their location in Las Vegas the following week. I picked it up and since I did it myself, there was no shipping cost. There was no problem. I paid for it with my personal credit card when I picked it up, as I had not established credit with them. My suggestion is that you get an extra supply of NaClO 2 if at all"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"146 Making MMS in Your Kitchen possible. The government has been acting at the request of the drug companies to limit the sales of sodium chlorite. Now that sodium chlorite\t has\t swung\t into\t use\t for\t MMS,\t it\t is\t eating\t into\t the\t profits\t of\t the\t drug\t companies.\t They\t are\t beginning\t to\t fight.\t They\t can’t\t win,\t but\t you\t can believe they will try. You can help this program simply by buying 100 pounds and storing it. As you know by now, the government has already started to attack MMS. It is already harder to buy NaClO 2 , but you can still get it. Buying Small Amounts of Sodium Chlorite (100 grams—5 pounds) There are a few companies that supply chemicals to chemistry students. These companies, along with other laboratory chemical supply companies, are the easiest to do business with, and you can generally order from them over the internet. Just search on “sodium chlorite” (or “stabilized oxygen” if you just want stabilized oxygen). You might also try “laboratory chemicals”. Lab Supply Houses That Sell Sodium Chlorite The companies listed below are in the U.S. I have included them just to give you an idea of some of the chemical supply places that sell sodium chlorite. www.advanced-scientific.net As of 9/1/06 they charged $36.45 for 100 gm, $117.00 for 500 gm, and $361 for 2,500 gm (5.5 pounds). www.labdepotinc.com Same\tprices\tas\t Advanced\tScientific,\tabove. https://secure5.nexternal.com Same prices as above. Using Barrels of Liquid Sodium Chlorite In some countries, and even in some states in the US, you will only be\t able\t to\t find\t barrels\t of\t liquid\t NaClO 2 . It is sold in various concen - trations, such as 25% NaClO 2 , or 28%, 31% or 33%. You can make MMS out of any one of these concentrations. •\t Be sure to determine whether the company recommends their\tNaClO2\tfor\twater\tpurification.\t And be sure that you do not mention what you are going to use it for."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"147 Making MMS in Your Kitchen Tell\t them\t you\t will\t be\t purifying\t the\t water\t in\t pools\t or\t fish\t tanks.\t They\t will say that it is absolutely not meant for any kind of consumption, but\t they\t sell\t it\t for\t water\t purification\t --\t hmm,\t I\t wonder\t what\t people\t do with drinking water? Although there are other uses for it, no one is\t going\t to\t put\t it\t in\t barrels\t unless\t it\t is\t suitable\t for\t water\t purification,\t as\t they\t would\t be\t wasting\t their\t money.\t Water\t purification\t would\t be\t their main sales. When using a powdered NaClO 2 , you must make the solution 28% of NaClO 2 powder and the rest of the solution is water. But keep in mind that there is never 28% sodium chloride (NaClO 2 ) in solution, as the powder you just put into the water is only 80% NaClO 2 . To determine the amount of NaClO 2 in solution, multiply the powdered NaClO2 by 80%. The actual percentage of full strength NaClO 2 will be 22.4% in solution. So when using a liquid solution of NaClO 2 bought in a barrel at any chemical\t supply\t house\t for\t the\t purpose\t of\t water\t purification,\t keep\t in\t mind that you will have to add the proper amount of distilled water to bring it to 22.4% NaClO 2 . So let’s say that you’ve bought a barrel of 31% NaClO 2 . Now in a real emergency, you could just bring that home and use it as is. Instead of using 3 drops it would be best to use 2 drops, but if lives are at stake, don’t hesitate. For example, if someone had the swine flu\t and\t they\t were\t spitting\t up\t blood\t from\t their\t lungs,\t that\t would\t be\t enough of an emergency to make you decide to use NaClO 2 from the 31% barrel rather than spending time converting it to 22.4%. Just use about 1/3 fewer drops than this book suggests. On the other hand, don’t start using a 31% barrel of NaClO 2 unless there is an emergency, as you will want your MMS to have the same results as given in this book. To sell extra-strong MMS just means people wouldn’t be able to make it work as given in the book. It could cause a lot of trouble. So only do this in an emergency. Otherwise use the formulas below to convert such a barrel to 22.4% NaClO 2 (MMS). The procedure for kilograms is given directly below, and the formula for pounds is give immediately afterwards. Working with Kilograms Step One: How much sodium chlorite is in your barrel?"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"148 Making MMS in Your Kitchen If you buy a barrel of 25% NaClO 2 or any other percentage, that percent is the weight of the NaClO 2 in solution. If you had a 50 kg barrel of 25% NaClO 2 and want to determine how much NaClO 2 is in it, multiply 0.25 times 50 kg. That gives you 12.5 kg NaClO 2 in your barrel. But that is at 25% and we only want to have 22.4%. So we already know the solution is too strong. Step Two: How much MMS will the 12.5 kg of sodium chlorite Make? Referring to the 50 kg barrel, the next step is to determine how much 22.4% solution (that’s MMS) the 12.5 kg of NaClO 2 in the barrel would actually make. So divide 12.5 by 22.4% (0.224). •\t 12.5 kg divided by 0.224 equals 55.8 kg. So we know that 12.5 kg will actually make 55.8 kg of MMS. We must add 5.8 kg of distilled water to the 50 kg barrel. Step Three: How much water to add to each kg of so- dium chlorite? It isn’t easy to add anything to a barrel when the barrel is already full.\t The\t easiest\t thing\t to\t do\t would\t be\t to\t find\t a\t bigger\t barrel.\t But\t that isn’t always easy either, so the next easiest thing to do is to determine how much distilled water must be added to each kilogram you remove from the barrel. (You can use any good clean water if you have no distilled water.) We know that we must add 5.8 kg to the entire barrel so divide that by 50 kg to determine how much distilled water we need to add to each kg that we remove from the barrel. So, 5.8 kg divided by 50 equals 0.116 kg. To change kg to grams just move the decimal point three places to the right. So it’s 116 grams of distilled water that you should add to each kg you remove from the barrel in order to make MMS (that is, a 22.4% solution of NaClO 2 ). Working With Pounds OK, you don’t work with kilograms, you work with pounds, so let’s go over the same thing with pounds. Step One: How much sodium chlorite is in your barrel? If you buy a barrel of 31% NaClO 2 or any other percentage, that percent is the weight of the NaClO 2 in solution. Let’s say you have a 150 lb barrel of 31% NaClO 2 .To determine how much NaClO 2 is in"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"149 Making MMS in Your Kitchen the 150 lbs, multiply 0.31 times 150 lbs. which gives you 46.5 lbs. of NaClO 2 in your barrel. Step Two: How much MMS can you make from 46.5 lbs. of sodium chlorite? Referring to the 150 lb. barrel, the next step is to determine how much 22.4% solution (MMS) you can make from the 46.5 lbs. of NaClO 2 in the barrel. So divide 46.5 lbs. by 22.4% (0.224). •\t 46.5 lbs. divided by 0.224 equals 207.6 lbs. So we know that 46.5 lbs. of NaClO 2 will make 207.6 lbs. of MMS. We then subtract the 150 lbs. from 207.6 to learn how much water we must add to the barrel. We must add 57.6 lbs. of distilled water to the 150 lb. barrel to bring it to the level of 22.4% NaClO 2 and that is 207.6 lbs. Step three: How much water to add to each pound of sodium chlorite? It isn’t easy to add anything to a barrel when the barrel is already full. The\t easiest\t thing\t to\t do\t would\t be\t to\t find\t a\t bigger\t barrel.\t But\t that\t isn’t\t always easy either, so the next easiest thing to do is to determine how much distilled water must be added to each one pound that you remove from the barrel. We know that we must add 57.6 lbs. to the entire barrel so divide that by 150 lbs. to determine how much distilled water we need to add to each pound we remove from the barrel. •\t 57.6 lbs. divided by 150 equals 0.384 lbs. Converted to ounces, that’s 6.1 ounces of distilled water that you should add to each pound you remove from the barrel in order to make a 22.4% solution of NaClO 2 . There are 16 ounces in a pound so you convert 0.384 pounds to ounces by multiplying it by 16. That equals 6.1 + 16 = 22.1 ounces of MMS at 22.4% NaClO 2 .

Making MMS Without a Scale Making MMS without a scale can be as easy as it is using a scale, and if you are careful, it can be just as accurate. Below is the process"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"150 Making MMS in Your Kitchen I\t used\t in\t the\t jungle\t in\t Africa\t when\t I\t could\t not\t find\t an\t accurate\t scale. For\t your\t first\t try,\t start\t out\t with\t small\t containers.\t You\t will\t always\t make\t a mistake, so make it small. See the pictures below for each step. Items You Will Need 1. Five non-metal containers all exactly the same size. You cannot fudge on this requirement. You simply have to have 5 containers of the same size and 4 of them will contain water. You can have glasses, 5-gallon buckets, 55 gallon barrels or any other kind of containers, but you must have 5 of them. They must not be metal . 2. A mixing container that will hold the water from four of the water containers. 3. Two narrow containers that will hold a little more than 28% of the total. \t ◊ One\t of\t these\t containers\t must\t fit\t into\t the\t other\t so\t that\t it\twill\tfloat.\t Remember, no metal containers must be used. The reason is that the chemical, sodium chlorite (NaClO 2 ), is highly alkaline and can leach metal ions into the solution, making it poisonous. It can leach the metal only so long as it is alkaline, but once activated it is no longer alkaline and thus MMS does not leach metal from any medical devices in the body. However, through oxidation, it can break up metal compounds in the body such as those involving mercury, lead, etc. Steps for Making MMS Without a Scale Step 1: Each of the four containers holds 25% of the total water, but we need 28%. To make things go smoothly at this point, please dump the water from containers 1 and 2 into the mixing container, which in this case, is a glass coffee pot. Step 2: Take the third 25% container and divide it in half by pouring half of it\t into\t the\t fifth\t container\t which\t was\t empty to begin with. That’s easy, as all you have to do is make sure the\t fifth\t and\t third\t containers\t have\t"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"151 Making MMS in Your Kitchen exactly the same amount of liquid in them. They each have 12.5% of the whole amount. (The fourth container we are saving for last.) Step 3: The water in one of these containers is not needed, but don’t throw it away – it goes into the mixing container, the coffee pot. So pour it in, as we are going to use the empty container again. Step 4: Take the remaining 12.5% container and pour half of it into the container that you just emptied into the coffee pot. Make sure that both containers have an equal amount of water in them. Use a spoon or even an eye dropper to make sure they are even. Now both containers have 6.25% of the whole amount of water we started with. We don’t need one of the 6.25% waters, but don’t discard it – it goes into the mixing container (coffee pot). Step 5: Pour half of the remaining 6.25% water into the empty container that we just emptied into the coffee pot. Each container will then contain 3.125%. Step 6: Now you can forget about the 0.125% of the 3.125%. That is only 1/8 of 1%. No scale that we would use here is that accurate, as it is only a few drops. Step 7: So now pour one of the 3.125% contents into the coffee pot and save the other one. The pot now holds 71.875% of required water. •\t What you have left is: (a) One container with 3.125%. water in it. (Remember: disregard the 0.125% and consider this container as 3% for our purpose.) And we also have: (b) One container with 25% of the whole in it, making a total of 28%. Step 8: Pour the 25% and the 3% into narrow container #1. Now there is 28% of the water’s weight in this container and the rest is in the coffee pot which now has 72% (rounded off). Now we need to put 28% NaClO 2 in the coffee pot because that is how much water we"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"152 Making MMS in Your Kitchen took out. Step 9: Pour some water into narrow container #2. Use a little more water\t than\t is\t in\t the\t first\t one\t because\t the\t first\t one\t must\t float\t in\t the\t second\t one\t without\t touching\t bottom. Now, if we do the following steps properly we will have 28% NaClO 2 by weight in the coffee pot. Step 10: Notice in the #11 & 12 picture below that a piece of white tape has been put on narrow container #1. But don’t\t attach\t the\t tape\t until\t that\t first\t container\t is\t floating\t in\t the\t second\t one. Then put the tape in place and mark a “ + “ sign on it level with the brim of narrow container #2. •\t You must be careful when doing this step because the bottle must\t be\t floating\t straight\t up\t and\t down, or if it leans, then you must make sure that it leans in the same direction on the next operation. Make an up-and-down mark on the brim of the second narrow container so that you always use the same place to check\tthe\tfloat.\t Step 11: Now that narrow container #1 is taped and marked properly, you must pour the water out, dry out the container, and put sodium chlorite powder in it. Do you see? We want the sodium chlorite powder to lower the floating\t narrow\t container\t #1\t exactly\t the same amount as the 28% water did. In other words, the NaClO 2 powder weight will be 28% of the water\t weight \tin\t the\t coffee\t pot.\t So\t we\t carefully\t work\t with\t the\t floating\t mechanism\t until\t we\t are\t satisfied\t that\t we\t have\t the\t same\t weight\t of\t powder in narrow container #1 as the weight of water before we poured it out and dried the container. Step 12: Now we dump this powder into the mixing container (coffee"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"153 Making MMS in Your Kitchen pot) and stir until it is dissolved in the 72% water in this pot. •\t There will not now be the same amount of total liquid, as the powder is replacing water and although it is the same weight, it is not the same volume. At this point, if you did use a coffee pot for the mixing container, you could warm the water in the coffee pot on a stove, electric or gas. Do not boil the water. Do not put the NaClO 2 in the pot until you have removed it from the stove. Then add it and mix until dissolved. Once it is totally dissolved, put it in a glass or plastic bottle until it is completely clear, which will be in a few hours. Since NaClO 2 looks like water, do not leave it in this bottle without attaching a clear label. Without a label, it could be a life-threatening bottle. It has no smell to distinguish it from water and it could kill or cause serious damage. Once it is clear, it is OK to put into small bottles that should, again, be immediately labeled. It’s OK to leave your NaClO 2 solution in a clear bottle out of the sunlight for a few days (less than a week) while you get the small bottles together. Be sure to bottle some citric acid also. #####"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" A friend recently introduced me to their daughter (42yr old) who has suffered with COPD for years.

This is\t the\t chemical\t that\t is\t now\t finally\t being\t used\t in\t the\t human\t body\t to destroy diseases through the application of MMS. Its chemical formula is ClO 2 ClO 2 also happens to be one of the two powerful killers that are generated by the human immune system for the purpose of killing diseases, killer cells gone bad, and various poisons.

Chlorine Dioxide Kills Viruses Chemically\t speaking,\t the\t first\t point\t that\t you\t should\t understand\t about\t ClO 2 is that it is as different from chlorine as is table salt. Table salt and chlorine dioxide both contain chlorine, but neither is poisonous when used properly in the human body. You might already know that although there are a few natural things that destroy viruses, there is no such thing as a manufactured antivirus. There are no drugs that can kill viruses. When you go to the hospital with viral pneumonia, for example, there is nothing they can give you to kill the virus. They often give an antibacterial for bacteria that might be associated with the virus, but they have no antivirus. Chlorine dioxide is one of the few known minerals (some call it a chemical but in fact it is also a mineral) that kills viruses and all other known\t pathogens\t on\t hospital\t floors,\t in\t animal\t slaughter\t houses,\t in\t water, on vegetables in farm food distribution centers, and now even in the human body."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"156 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists For more than 70 years, chlorine dioxide has been used to kill pathogens\t in\t water\t supplies\t without\t killing\t the\t beneficial\t bacteria.\t This unique chemical has characteristics that set it aside from all other chemicals when it comes to destroying disease-causing micro- organisms of all kinds. It does not harm the human body in any way, or\t even\t affect\t the\t beneficial\t bacteria\t in\t the\t body,\t when\t used\t in\t therapeutic amounts.Oxidation Potential In order to understand the characteristics of ClO 2 , one should understand a little of the chemistry. Oxidation is the mechanism by which the majority of the pathogens in the human body are destroyed. Oxygen is only one of a number of oxidizers used in the body. Oxidation can also do a certain amount of damage in our systems. The oxidation power of an oxidizer is measured in electrical potential, usually in millivolts. Of the oxidizers that have been used in the human body: •\t Ozone is the strongest known oxidizer used in the body with an oxidation potential of 2070 millivolts; •\t Hydrogen peroxide is the second strongest oxidizer used in the body and it has an oxidation potential of 1800 millivolts; •\t Oxygen itself has an oxidation potential of about 1300 millivolts; •\t Chlorine dioxide has an oxidation potential of 950 millivolts and it is the weakest oxidizer used in the body. Note that chlorine dioxide has the lowest oxidation potential of all. Each oxidizer is known not only for what it can oxidize, but also After Hurricane Katrina, a circus tent over 7 restaurants that are being fumigated with ClO 2 gas for 3 days. The ClO 2 removed all fungus, mold, insects, and odors. All fabrics and woodwork were unaffected."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"157 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists for what it cannot oxidize. This characteristic is determined by the oxidation potential . The human body was designed around oxygen , as oxygen has the best oxidation potential for maintaining life. It oxidizes a great number of things, but does not have the potential to oxidize\t a\t number\t of\t other\t things\t such\t as\t beneficial\t bacteria in the stomach. But oxygen does do damage in the body under certain conditions. If one breathes pure oxygen for too long, it will damage the lungs ; or if one stays in a hyperbaric chamber (oxygen-under-pressure chamber) too long, damage can occur in many areas of the body. It has been known for a long time that oxygen causes aging and the body manufactures antioxidants to help prevent this from happening. Many companies sell antioxidants in pill form to help prevent the damage that oxygen can cause. On the other hand, as I mentioned above, ClO 2 only has an oxidation potential of 950 millivolts. It cannot oxidize anything in the blood, the cells or the tissues, or in the cells of any of the body’s structures. Of course, like any other substance such as water or salt, if ClO 2 is used in too great a quantity, it can do damage. However: •\t The quantities of ClO 2 used for destroying diseases in the body are more than 100 times lower than the quantity needed to do damage in the body. Something to Check for Yourself Oxygen will rust iron, but although chlorine dioxide is a powerful oxidizer it does not have a high enough oxidation potential to rust iron. Try it with nails in water with both oxygen and chlorine dioxide. A chemist can show you how to set up the experiment. You will see that chlorine dioxide cannot rust iron but oxygen does. •\t Put a handful of standard nails in a pitcher of water. Bubble some oxygen through the water and the nails will rust. •\t Now do the same thing with nails in a pitcher of water but this time, add chlorine dioxide. Add a hefty dose of MMS but not more than two or three times stronger than the strongest MMS dose one would ever take. It is the same way in the body. Chlorine dioxide cannot oxidize things in the body just as it cannot oxidize iron. But it can oxidize pathogens quite easily."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"158 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists Osmotic and Isotonic Pressures There is another reason why chlorine dioxide(ClO 2 ) does not destroy red blood cells and some other special cells in the body. It has been suggested by some non-chemists, including FDA personnel, that ClO 2 \tdoes\t damage\t the\t red\t blood\t cells.\t Their\t “scientific”\t criticism\t mentions that ClO 2 causes hemolysis (rupturing of the red blood cells).\t It\t is\t “scientific”\t mainly\t because\t they\t copied\t the\t word\t hemolysis correctly. So\t in\t the\t interest\t of\t a\t genuine\t scientific\t explanation,\t let\t me\t give\t you\t a\tcouple\tmore\tscientific\twords. •\t Isotonic and •\t Osmotic. Cells, including red blood cells, do not have skin as on our body, but a skin that is a type of membrane. It will allow only certain nutrients and chemicals into the cell and waste materials out of the cell. Osmotic pressure is the pressure of certain liquids on the cell that allows them to penetrate the cell membrane (skin). Normally, when there is less osmotic pressure inside the cell than there is on the outside, the stronger pressure outside pushes liquid through the membrane to the inside of the cell. This is a kind of automatic feeding mechanism of nature. As the cell uses up the nutrients pushed through the membrane, osmotic pressure pushes more of that particular liquid through to the inside of the cell. Now let’s look at the words isotonic or isotonic liquid . Isotonic refers to a liquid that exerts no osmotic pressure inward on certain cells in a liquid. It will not penetrate a cell’s membrane. In this case we refer to red blood cells. A liquid that is isotonic to red blood cells exerts no osmotic pressure inward on them, even when they are suspended in a liquid containing many ingredients, like blood. And now, enter chlorine dioxide(ClO 2 ). At concentrations of 0.001% in water, ClO 2 is isotonic (exerts no osmotic pressure inward) to red blood cells. This was discovered back in the 1980s. Scientists have not yet explained the exact reason for this phenomenon, but if you read the patents listed below, you will see that quite a number of them depend on the discovery of this phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"159 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists •\t In all cases ClO 2 as used in MMS is less than 10% of 0.001% concentration. It cannot penetrate a red blood cell’s membrane, which is far too tough to be damaged by ClO 2 oxidation from the outside. The\t scientific\t laboratories\t known\t to\t be\t working\t with\t ClO 2 keep coming up with new understandings of how the chlorine dioxide ion works. You may ask why the explanation I give here differs somewhat from the explanation in my last book. Well, we all learn more data as we travel through life. So I also may not have the fully correct explanation at this time. But the fact is, that modern science still hasn’t produced a complete theory of the ClO 2 ion. We have all heard the saying, “The proof of the pudding is in the eating.” Well, using MMS, hundreds of thousands of disease victims have overcome their suffering without side effects or problems. And hundreds of blood specimens have been examined with no red blood cell damage reported so far. So the data I am giving you here is correct, but there may be more to it. We will probably know more by time the next book is ready. But please read on for more on this topic. Patents Proving the Safety of ClO2 The following patents issued over 10 years ago show extensive tests proving that ClO 2 does not damage red blood cells. Please read them for your own satisfaction: •\t 5,185,371 •\t 5,211,912 •\t 4,971,760 •\t 4,944,920 Getting it Straight About MMS Concentration As we pointed out in Chapter 9, Critics of MMS & Jim Humble , (p. 33), the cell walls (membranes) of a pathogen are probably less than 1/10,000 of an inch thick. But the walls of body components are 1/32 inch thick. In other words, body cell walls are thousands of times thicker than pathogen cell walls. MMS kills the pathogen by blowing a hole in its wall, either directly or after white blood cells have carried the MMS to the pathogen. (Certain white blood cells absorb the ClO 2 created by MMS, surround the pathogen, and release the ClO 2 to"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"160 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists do its work.) The average dose of activated MMS (chlorine dioxide) is 3 drops. Those 3 drops contain about 15 mg of chlorine dioxide. That’s about one tenth of the amount of table salt you might shake on your dinner. •\t Then that is diluted 675 times with water or juice, making a solution that is 0.00004% strength instead of the 28% that the FDA claims in their lies. That dose of 3 drops gets spread throughout your body. If all my critics were right and MMS did the same thing to the body that it does to the pathogen, the body would never feel it, nor would it have any effect on the body. Remember, the pathogen’s skin is only 1/10,000 of an inch thick and MMS can indeed eat through that thickness of cell membrane . But in a thickness of 1/32 inch, a skin that is at least a thousand times thicker, a few chlorine dioxide ions are nothing. MMS, in the concentrations used internally, exerts no osmotic pressure on red blood cells – it is isotonic (neutral) to them and has no effect whatever on their membranes. Critics’ Irresponsibility My critics go read a couple of technical bulletins and then come back and write me another email with a lot of technical words they have just read and try to show how a couple of grains of ClO 2 will destroy the body. If they weren’t educated people it wouldn’t be so bad, but they talk about integrity while showing that they have none at all. They refuse to consider that if there is a slight chance of me being right, their talk can destroy the chances of hundreds from getting well and resuming their lives. You might ask why I mention the critics? Well, every one of them has a certain following, and in addition, there are always those new people who read the faulty logic. Over a period of time, hundreds of people who could have been saved from suffering and even from death then go away believing what the critics have said. Thus they lose their chance to live a normal life. This is what I try to prevent – basically, the irresponsibility of critics. I know it sounds like I am being dramatic, but as I see it, I’m not nearly dramatic enough. When there is the slightest chance that what you say might cause someone to go on suffering or even die, it is evil to not educate yourself on the subject you talk about. But none of these critics do. Even the educated doctors just talk off the top of"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"161 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists their head because when they see the words “chlorine dioxide”, they believe it is OK to spout nonsense. Why don’t they just go out and check a few thousand people who have overcome some life-threatening disease or another, instead of trying to prove it can’t be done? In fact, it is being done and the Genesis 2 Church now has 139 Ministers of Health with more each month, in more than 40 countries, ministering to thousands of people free of charge, healing them and leaving them symptom-free as they move forward. The\t only\t reason\t I\t can\t figure\t for\t the\t critics’\tsilly\t behavior\t is\t jealousy.\t They certainly can’t be worried that we will hurt someone, as the medical profession kills more than a million people every year and they are not out beating the drum against them. We haven’t killed anybody and the critics beat the drums widely against us. I suppose they think it is OK for all those drugs to kill people as long as they have a license for the drugs. Why Does Chlorine Dioxide Kill Only Pathogens and Poisons? By now you must wonder why pathogens are the only things that ClO 2 can destroy. Well, ClO 2 can probably destroy many things, but the only things in the body that it can destroy are pathogens. It just happens because of their nature that almost all pathogens, including bacteria , molds, yeast, fungi, and disease-causing parasites , have outer membranes (skins) that can be easily oxidized by chlorine dioxide. The fact is that ClO 2 is extremely explosive to the outer membranes of these disease-causing microorganisms. When it is present in the same amounts as oxygen , it is much more effective than oxygen -- not because it is a stronger oxidizer, but because it has a much larger oxidation capacity . It blows a hole in the outer layer of the pathogen, thus killing it, and there is no way to develop a resistance to chlorine dioxide’s action. This is true whether the ClO 2 ion is acting indepen - dently or whether a white blood cell has carried it to the pathogen. Tests You Can Do For Yourself Test #1: What Does MMS do to a Plant? When red blood cells and other body cells are healthy, they are"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"162 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists resistant to chlorine dioxide. However, many critics say that ClO 2 runs though the body and kills everything in its path. Here is a test you can do to check that idea. •\t Make up a strong MMS solution, much stronger than one that you would drink by mouth. Let me suggest a 10-drop dose of MMS in an ounce of water. That’s 40 times stronger than most doses and at least 10 times stronger than any dose you will ever take. •\t Now take it to any delicate plant you might have, or grass or a tree. Spray it on any of the leaves or other parts of the plant. It will do no damage to the plant. Following any of the protocols, you will never take a dose that strong, yet this dose will do no damage to the most delicate plant. It cannot harm plants that are hundreds of times more delicate than your skin and more delicate than any of your organs or the cell surfaces of your digestive tract. Of course, plants are different than body organs , but not that much different. The cells are very similar. All the critics have been saying, without ever checking the chemistry , that ClO 2 just runs amuck and kills everything in its path. This test at least proves that chlorine dioxide does not kill everything in its path. But let me also suggest that you take some Clorox and spray it on a plant. You will see the plant die. That is because there is chlorine in the Clorox. Test #2: Will MMS Kill Plant Bugs? Spray some ClO 2 on any of the bugs you see on the above plants. Guess what? If you do not spray enough MMS to drown the bug, it will not die. In fact, the MMS will help it by killing its pathogens . Now get some Clorox or any liquid with chlorine in it and spray a similar bug. It will immediately die. Chlorine kills all these things but chlorine dioxide does not. You should be starting to get an under - standing of chlorine dioxide by now. It is selective in what it kills. The amazing fact is that: •\t MMS kills pathogens without killing larger bugs and animals and without doing the slightest damage to human or animal body cells. The Most Plausible Explanation so Far Pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) generate waste"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"163 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists material that is poisonous and creates the symptoms of whatever disease the pathogen causes. In nature, these poisons are mostly negatively charged – have a negative Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP). Further, the oxidization potential of chlorine dioxide is positive -- it has to be in order for ClO 2 to do any oxidizing. The negative charge is attracted to the positive charge of the ClO 2 and this kills the pathogen. Of course, the good bacteria make no poisons and have no negative charge. As far as heavy metal compounds are concerned, their chemistry allows them to be oxidized by ClO 2 . While ozone , hydrogen peroxide , and even oxygen, will oxidize the heavy metal compounds, they seldom arrive where the metal compounds are. The compounds are doing their damage deep in the tissues of various body organs . These 3 oxidizers cannot penetrate deeply enough to reach them because they all have a tendency to oxidize some of the body cells or other body items before they arrive at the heavy metals. •\t Chlorine dioxide does penetrate deeply into the tissues because it is not used up by oxidizing other things before reaching the metal compounds or pathogens. The fact that chlorine dioxide can reach deep into the tissues is proof that it does not oxidize body cells. Further proof is in the fact that hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved so far. Now you know half of the theory of chlorine dioxide . You know why it doesn’t damage the body. But why does it kill pathogens that are in the body? What is Oxidation and Why Does Oxidation Kill Pathogens? The\t first\t part\t of\t understanding\t oxidation\t is\t to\t understand\t that\t the\t electrons in matter are what hold the particles of matter together. Electrons hold all matter of the Universe together. When the electrons are\t removed \tfrom\t any\t substance,\t the\t substance\t flies\t apart\t and\t basically is destroyed. Another way of looking at electrons is that they are considered shells surrounding a molecule and holding it together. The oxidation potential talked about in the above paragraphs refers to the amount of electrical attraction that an oxidizer has to draw away the electrons holding another substance together. As you can"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"164 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists probably imagine, the higher the millivolts, the greater the ability to draw away electrons. How Chlorine Oxidizes I should mention that some kinds of oxidation are a little more complex. For example when chlorine oxidizes a substance, we call it “chlorination.” The reason for this is that the electrons are rearranged in the substance being oxidized and the chlorine combines with that substance to create new substances. When chlorine is used, the new\t substances\t --\t in\t some\t cases,\t even\t in\t water\t purification systems -- are actually cancer-causing. How Chlorine Dioxide Oxidizes Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 does not oxidize in that way. It draws all the electrons away and never combines with anything. It is destroyed in the process. Thus there is a “clean kill” and the substance that is destroyed and the ClO 2 leave no new chemical compounds behind. So chlorine kills by creating new substances, and chlorine dioxide completely destroys, leaving no new substances. The chemical formula of chlorine dioxide , ClO 2 shows that it has one atom of chlorine, that’s the Cl, and two atoms of oxygen, that’s the O 2 Chlorine dioxide is the weakest of the oxidizers that are used in the body . It has an oxidation potential of only 950 millivolts. When the electrons in a ClO 2 molecule hold the chlorine atom and the two oxygen atoms together, the combination has a completely different character than either chlorine or oxygen atoms alone. The combination that we call a molecule has a need, or more precisely, a voltage, that will draw 5 electrons from certain other molecules.\t When\t the\t electrons\t are\t drawn\t away,\t these\t molecules\t fly\t apart. You might think that when a ClO 2 molecule pulls over these electrons, they would strengthen its outer shell, but not so. Instead, they neutralize the ClO 2 \touter\t shell\t and\t that\t molecule\t also\t flies\t apart.\t The chlorine atom becomes a chloride (table salt) atom and the two oxygen atoms are discharged before they leave the shell so they just collect a molecule of carbon and become carbon dioxide . They can no longer do anything in the body and thus are breathed out."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"165 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists Oxidation Potential vs Oxidation Capacity One of the amazing things about ClO 2 is that its special construction gives it an unusually high oxidation capacity . The oxidation potential is weak, but the capacity is that it can draw away 5 electrons. •\t Think of oxygen as a single-shot, large barrel, high powered rifle,\t and\t chlorine\t dioxide \tas\t a\t small-barrel\t hand\t held\t machine\t gun. Each chlorine dioxide ion can draw away 5 electrons from any substance that it is able to oxidize, while oxygen can only draw 2 electrons. So one ClO 2 ion can destroy up to 5 molecules. That’s more than any of the other oxidizers in the body . Amazingly, the only substances in the human body that it can oxidize are pathogens and poisonous chemical compounds which are usually heavy metal compounds . Remember, that’s because of the very low oxidation potential and the absence of any osmotic pressure exerted inward by chlorine dioxide on many cells. I should mention here that if you go to a very good university and talk\t to\t a\t chemistry\t professor\t you\t will\t find\t that\t there\t are\t still\t things\t concerning the ClO 2 molecule that are not understood by chemical scientists.\t Most\t of\t it\t has\t been\t figured\t out,\t but\t not\t everything.\t There\t are a few places where things are still assumed, rather than known, even by the scientists. Some write-ups by inexperienced chemists state that the oxygen ions coming away from the chlorine dioxide molecule are nascent oxygen (extremely active oxygen), but that is not true. These oxygen ions have already been discharged, the same as the oxygen in carbon dioxide. •\t If the nascent oxygen ion theory were correct, the oxidation potential would jump to 1300 millivolts and the damage to the body would be extensive. But the entire time that the chlorine dioxide ion is oxidizing a pathogen, the oxidation potential does not exceed 950 millivolts. As noted above, the ClO 2 ion itself is destroyed in the oxidation action. If this entire paragraph was not true, most of the value of chlorine dioxide in industry would be lost."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"166 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists Chlorine Dioxide Oxidization Steps The chlorine dioxide oxidation proceeds as follows: •\t The ClO 2 \t ion\t first\t draws\t off\t a\t single\t electron\t from\t the\t pathogen; •\t That electron then comes over to the chlorine dioxide and instantly changes it to a sodium chlorite ion; and it begins to make a hole in the pathogen. •\t The ClO 2 ion then draws 4 more electrons from the pathogen or the nearest other pathogen. •\t This completely destroys the sodium chlorite , leaving only sodium chloride (table salt), and two neutralized oxygen atoms that just become a part of the body’s water or part of ClO 2 to be breathed out of the body. This one chlorine dioxide molecule is responsible for destroying 5 molecules in the side of the pathogen. Of course it may take a few more molecules of chlorine dioxide to make the hole in the pathogen but that is what happens to destroy a pathogen. That makes it a clean kill because both items, the chlorine dioxide and the molecules in the side of the pathogen, are destroyed, leaving nothing behind except neutralized particles that simply wash out of the body. •\t Except the dead pathogen with a hole in his side. That is what causes the Herxheimer reaction . The dead pathogens dump a certain amount of poison into the system and the system must get rid of it. Killing the pathogens too fast can cause too much poison to accumulate and thus create nausea. The same thing happens with heavy metal compounds except usually there is no Herxheimer reaction as they are completely neutralized. Killing Viruses You may wonder how ClO 2 kills viruses, since they are thousands of times smaller than other organisms. It kills them in a different way than it kills other organisms. Both viruses and the entire body are constructed mostly of protein (and water). The body creates tens of thousands of special proteins for various jobs – it grows by forming proteins in organs and tissues such as muscles."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"167 Chemical Explanation of MMSand Other Data forLaymen and Scientists Each body part requires a number of different proteins and viruses depend on some of these proteins for their growth. It so happens that these special proteins cannot form in the presence of chlorine dioxide – their formation is prevented by the oxidation electrical potential that chlorine dioxide exerts on its immediate environment. The chemical reaction prevents the growth of the special proteins that make up the viruses, and eventually when the virus cannot grow, it dies. #####"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" My name is Julia, I am 36 years old.

They all kill pathogens by oxidation . For years, ozone and hydrogen peroxide have been used in the human body to kill many diseases and even to oxidize heavy metal compounds to some extent. Many lives have been saved and much suffering has been overcome using these two oxidizers, mostly by intravenous injection . Two Disadvantages of Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide Ozone is the most powerful oxidizer known that is used in the body and\t hydrogen\t peroxide\t is\t a\t close\t second.\t In\t the\t healing\t field,\t they\t both have been very useful as they both can kill any pathogen known. #1 These two oxidizers are so strong that they not only kill germs, they\t also\t damage\t beneficial\t flora\t and\t fauna and even body cells. The extent of the damage is partly determined by the amount of chemical in solution. But it doesn’t matter how diluted the ozone or hydrogen peroxide is, or how small their quantities are -- they can still oxidize things that you may not want to oxidize. #2 Because of their power, and tendency to oxidize many things, they get used up before they reach pathogens hidden deep in the tissues. They cannot penetrate deeply into the body. This is not to say that they haven’t been useful in treating some diseases that nothing else can destroy, but they also do a certain amount of damage along the way. There are many diseases that simply hide too deeply in the tissues to be reached by these oxidizers. Hydrogen peroxide was once sold from the shelves of almost all health food stores in America, but it was discovered to be creating a number of health problems. It not only killed pathogens-- it also killed many\t beneficial\t bacteria \tand\t the\t dead\t beneficial\t ones\t left\t more\t room\t for pathogens to grow. It was counter-productive. I personally used hydrogen peroxide every day and I developed a\t terrible\t taste\t in\t my\t mouth\t that\t also\t smelled\t pretty\t bad.\t I\t finally\t"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"170 Oxidizers and Oxidation stopped using it and the health of my mouth returned. Health food stores all stopped offering it, as it became evident that it was doing more harm than good. As time passed, a few health food stores began to offer it again, but they risk being sued, as the problems of hydrogen peroxide are known and on the internet. There are now quite a number of proponents of ozone and many of hydrogen peroxide as well. They continue to push these two oxidizers as being the best thing possible or the only thing possible to treat a number of diseases. I personally wouldn’t want to suggest that they cannot help. But they are not the only thing available anymore, as now there are MMS1 and 2. The use of intravenous injection is not a simple matter to most of the world. It takes equipment and special knowledge so the general public is never going to be able to self-administer intravenous injections, which is the way ozone and hydrogen peroxide are ad- ministered. In addition to that, one still has the problems mentioned above. Enter MMS 1 and MMS 2 MMS1 (sodium chlorite), when activated, generates chlorine dioxide , a very special oxidizer that is not powerful at all. It is a weak oxidizer, but powerful in a different way. It doesn’t have the oxidation potential required to oxidize most materials. Just about the only living things it can oxidize are pathogens. There are many non-living things that it can oxidize, but not living things. When I say it is powerful in a different way, I mean that it has a much greater capacity for pathogens than ozone or hydrogen peroxide while being unable to oxidize hundreds of things that these other two can oxidize. MMS1 penetrates deeply into the body tissues and is not used up on the way to the target. It simply cannot oxidize any of the living cells of the human body. How MMS2 Works Activated MMS1 (chlorine dioxide ) is one of the two important chemicals that the human immune system generates naturally to kill disease pathogens and other unwelcome items in the body. The other is MMS2 (calcium hypochlorite ). Isn’t it funny that the two master minerals that are hundreds of times more effective than any drug are both chemicals that the human body has been using for hundreds of"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"171 Oxidizers and Oxidation thousands of years? But I think what is most funny (funny peculiar not funny ha-ha) is that modern medicine never discovered this in their billions of dollars of research. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have already proven that MMS1 and MMS2 can be effectively self-administered. This allows MMS1 and 2 to be used throughout the world in thousands of places where it would be impossible to use ozone . When ingested, MMS2 turns into a special weak acid that the human immune system generates naturally to kill hundreds of different pathogens and other things in the body that need killing. The name of this acid is hypochlorous acid and it is a natural acid. It is considered an oxidizer because in the presence of some proteins , it releases nascent oxygen (very active oxygen). Hypochlorous acid can penetrate deeply into body tissues before it encounters the pathogen proteins and then it releases the powerful nascent oxygen which oxidizes the pathogen. This release of nascent oxygen is the special mechanism that MMS 2 uses and neither ozone nor hydrogen peroxide can match it. Under certain conditions, the body cannot generate enough hypochlorous acid to handle powerful diseases. But when MMS 2 is taken, extra hypo- chlorous acid is furnished to the body and in most cases, the disease is killed in just a few hours or several days. The body chose well when it began to use hypochlorous acid, as no pathogen has ever developed a resistance to it in a hundred thousand years. No Side Effects Diseases can hide deep in the body tissues, but hypochlorous acid is a liquid that slowly penetrates deeper and deeper into the tissues until\t it\t is\t flowing\t as\t deeply\t as\t the\t disease\t pathogens.\t As\t a\t molecule of hypochlorous acid recognizes the protein in a pathogen molecule, it instantly releases its oxygen molecule that kills the pathogen. The chlorine atom changes into chloride (table salt), and a hydrogen ion, which becomes a part of the body’s water. No new compounds are created and nothing is left behind but salt. •\t There is nothing left to create side effects. Of course, the nascent oxygen destroys the pathogen and becomes discharged oxygen, which becomes carbon dioxide and is breathed out."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"172 Oxidizers and Oxidation So you can see, MMS 1 and MMS2 are master minerals far beyond ozone and hydrogen peroxide and any other known oxidizers. Both of these chemicals have saved thousands of lives and the two working together can probably dispose of any disease known. At least they will kill any disease that is caused by pathogens and I do not know of a disease that is not caused by pathogens in one way or another. MMS1 and 2 will kill many diseases that ozone and hydrogen peroxide cannot touch as well as every disease that these oxidizers are currently being used to kill. Let’s Retire Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide Ozone and hydrogen peroxide are no longer required and should be retired. Sorry, but I have treated more than 5000 people and some of these were being treated with ozone or hydrogen peroxide at the time. I always suggested that they stop those treatments and do MMS. It always worked quickly. Both MMS1 and 2 are faster and many times more effective. MMS1 and 2 chemistry theory is much better, they are much easier to use, and thousands of saved lives now prove the point. Please check the facts out before you continue with ozone or hydrogen peroxide. Normally, intravenous MMS treatment is not required, but it can be used in special cases and a few doses will heal most minor things. Also, Protocol 1000 will heal most diseases thought to be untreatable. •\t Protocol 1000 is simply giving a sick person 3 drops of activated MMS1 each hour for 8 to 10 hours a day for 3 weeks. Many patients can treat themselves but some require special treatment. When something is really bad, like a patient about to die of cancer, then add MMS2 every 2 hours. I have personally seen a number of people come right out of severe diseases and go back to work. That’s from “about to die” to “back to work” in two or three weeks. For more details, please see Chapter 13, MMS Protocols. Safety of Taking MMS In 1982, a research testing program was conducted to study and compare acutely increasing doses of chlorine dioxide, sodium chlorate, and sodium chlorite. It used adult male volunteers and was conducted by Judith R. Lubbers, Sudha Chauan, and Joseph R. Bianchine under the auspices of the US EPA #CR805643*. It covered 12 weeks in all and advanced to using doses up to 25ppm."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"173 Oxidizers and Oxidation Yet no adverse reactions or effects were noted in any of the test subjects. Data can be found by using the US EPA CR# above or by going to Environmental Health Perspectives, Department of Phar- macology, The Ohio State University, College of Medicine, 333 W. 10th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210. The\t final\t report\t shows\t that\t much\t lower\t doses\t of\t sodium\t chlorite\t were\t being used in the study than the doses of either chlorine dioxide or sodium chlorate. And of course, that is what the critics dwell on. \t However you must keep in mind that sodium chlorite giv- en as Mimesis, in every case, neutralized with food acid (citric acid) before being ingested. Thus users of MMS get only trace amounts of sodium chlorite which are far below the safety levels suggested by the FDA. The FDA has to lie in order to declare MMS dangerous. The levels ingested of sodium chlorite as MMS are below the levels used in the above mentioned tests and below what the FDA considers dangerous. -------------------------- * J. environ.Pathol.Toxicol.5 (2,3): 879 – 888 1982 #####"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" I discovered MMS a few years ago by accident.

After mixing the first dose and forgetting to put water in it, and taking it, my eyes about bugged out. I drank some water and waited. It had an almost immediate and positive effect and I felt strength coming into my body and along with it, a general sense of confidence that everything was going to be all right.

Without getting too technical, these drugs, of which there are many dozens, are supposed to keep the viruses from increasing in numbers, or to at least hold their numbers steady. In theory, they do this by poisoning the virus. I have sitting in front of me a box containing a bottle of 60 ARV tablets. The drugs included in this box are Lamivudine, Stavudine, and Nevirapine. The brand name of the tablets is Nevilast . The box also has the name of the government stamped on it, I guess to show their\t approval\t and\t probably\t to\t show\t that\t they\t are\t helping\t to\t finance\t these tablets. I bet you didn’t think I would give the name. I could hope they would sue me in a court of law, as I can easily prove what I say here. Live Longer – 5 More Years or 49? When\t the\t ARVs\t first\t came\t out,\t it\t was\t said\t that\t if\t you\t have\t HIV or AIDS they would likely help you to live 5 years longer than if you didn’t take them. After a few years, they began to say that these ARVs would help you live 10 years longer. The drugs didn’t change; they are the same. Then it was 15 years longer, then 24 years longer, and now it is 49 years longer. The drugs haven’t improved, they are the same. If you question the medical doctors who prescribe these drugs about it, they say, well, they have developed better ways of prescribing the drugs. Can you imagine, if you get HIV/AIDS now at the age of 20, you can expect to live to 69 years of age if you take thousands of dollars worth of ARVs during your life? Wow, isn’t that amazing. Heck, I bet we all should be taking them. The next logical jump in life expectancy will probably be 100 years. However: •\t There isn’t one single long-term test to prove even the 5 years, much less the 49 years. It’s only the drug company’s “say so.” They made sure not to put a single claim on this bottle in front of me, or say it anywhere in writing, that the drugs make you live longer.

The doctors here in this country of Africa tell the local people that if they don’t take these terribly poisonous drugs, they will die. The doctors have nothing to back up what they are saying except the word of the drug company sales people. But the drug companies do not have any literature that says these drugs make you live longer. Why should they stick their necks out when the doctors will do it for them? Don’t take my word for it -- check it out on the internet. Search on Google for such tests. Call the ARV companies and ask for the tests. See what they say. I have. Some Quotes From ARV Packaging I want to quote a few things on this paper that is shipped with the bottle. Under “Warnings and Precautions” on one of the lines it says: •\t “Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including FATAL CASES, have been reported.” [my emphasis] Then it says: •\t “A majority of these (fatal) cases have been in women.” The words “majority have been in women,” tell us there were also male fatalities. Now look on down the page. After naming 20 or so different diseases that can occur in people taking this drug, it says: •\t “Severe, life-threatening skin reactions, including FATAL CASES, have occurred in patients” (taking these drugs).” [my emphasis] And then, in one other place on the front page, after naming some more diseases that have occurred, it says, •\t “Severe or life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including FATAL fulminant hepatitis has occurred in patients treated with Nevirapine.” [my emphasis] On the back of the page is listed pancreatitis, hepatitis and liver failure plus diarrhea , malaise, fatigue, headache, nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain, neuropathy, arthraigia, myalgias, skin rash, pruritus"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"177 MMS, ARVs, and Vaccines ... and the list goes on and on for what would be a full typewritten sheet. It includes a couple more FATAL case warnings that have already occurred. And yet, they have not written anywhere that this drug can give you 49 years or even 5 years more life than you would have if you don’t take it. But the salesmen say it, and the magazine writers say it, and the doctors say it. They don’t put it in writing because they can’t prove it, and there are no studies proving it. But they can certainly pay writers and doctors to give an opinion that HIV cases will live longer with these drugs. The studies cited are such things as a group of scientists spending months examining 43,000 HIV cases where the patients started taking ARV drugs at different times in the progress of their disease, and they have: •\t “... come to the conclusion, and they have estimated after examining all these HIV/AIDS cases that a 20 year old can live to be 69 years old by taking ARVs.” That’s just these scientists’ say so. There is no other proof. There are no clinical trials or tests showing that, but I’ll tell you there are a lot of local AIDS patients dying right here right now. Can you see any possible sense in believing that this tremendously poisonous drug that has already killed hundreds of test cases and has given all those diseases I listed above, and another hundred diseases I didn’t list, will enable one to live 49 years longer? In the last 35 years that ARVs have been available, they have not been improved. There are no tests saying any of them make you live longer. Some of the doctors may have been duped, and others just don’t care. But the fact is, these drugs are killing people by the thousands in Africa and in the rest of the world. As in the world of cancer , people step up and say, “Kill me, please Doc.” Here is another warning that a drug company gives about its ARV. •\t “Patients should be informed that KALETRA is not a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportu - nistic infections and other complications associated with HIV disease.

In 90% of the cases you will have a 10% chance if you do absolutely nothing. That’s been happening for 100 years, and then along comes HIV , created by U.S. labs and spread worldwide by WHO (World Health Organization), and the same thing is happening. Yes, doctor , let me take those extremely poisonous ARV drugs that have been killing hundreds of people and keeping thousands of others sick with dozens of different diseases, because I know that they will keep me alive for 49 more years. How crazy is that? Well the answer is that those whose greed is so strong that they cannot control their desire for money prey on the gullible. They are evil beyond anything this world has ever seen before. Here in Africa, the drug companies take billions from the governments and thus from the people as well, while killing those they are supposed to be helping.

So if people or doctors or clinics were to follow the actual research papers that have been published worldwide, they would have to quit using ARVs and give vitamins and minerals and other nutrition to HIV patients. This would save governments a lot of money and really help some people. Of course, we use MMS, which acts much faster and more completely than vitamins.

If is not below 400 there is nothing they can do for you, they say. So they wait until your CD4 count drops below 400 and then they start you on ARVs. Gonorrhea and syphilis can lead to HIV, they say, so they start you on\t ARVs.\t Actually,\t most\t of\t those\t immune\t deficiency\t diseases\t were\t easy to handle in the past, before HIV, but now if you have one of them, you are declared to have HIV.

Step #1: If\t you\t have\t any\t of\t a\t number\t of\t immune\t deficiency\t diseases which were usually treatable before, now you are no longer treated.

Step #5: Then you are declared to have full-blown AIDS. In my opinion it is the most sinister, evil thing ever foisted on mankind. What can MMS do about ARVs? Well, it appears that MMS neutralizes the ARVs right in the body. We have more than 800 people who have completed the MMS HIV/AIDS Protocol, in other words Protocol 1000. What we have proven\t so\t far\t is\t that\t in\t this\t first\t 800,\t the\t ARVs\t do\t not\t stop\t MMS\t from working. All 800 people have tossed off their health problems and are back to normal or above normal. Heart problems are gone, cancers gone, liver problems gone and dozens of other normally untreatable problems gone, and they are still taking ARVs. Out of the 800, only one or two quit taking ARVs. The doctors have the rest convinced that they will die if they quit taking them. In all those who have had a CD4 count done (white blood cells), the count has gone up to at least normal. Typically, the ARVs make one feel bad, but those taking MMS are not feeling bad. I really hate to alert the drug companies to what we are doing, but this is the only way I can get the information out to the world. Mostly, the drug companies won’t believe it anyway. MMS Neutralizes the ARVs We don’t have the millions of dollars to prove these things, but the evidence is pretty sure. So let’s extrapolate a little. The particular kinds of poisons they are using are very complex. Drugs are all very complex. These poisons don’t hold up in a very oxidative environment. It is my opinion that MMS must be destroying the poisons, else why would people get well and regain their health in such a short period as three weeks while still putting tremendous poisons in their bodies? What holds the drugs together (or any complex molecule ) is of course, electrons. Electrons hold all the composition of matter in the universe together. Oxidizers “steal” electrons away from molecules,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"181 MMS, ARVs, and Vaccines thus destroying their structure. Chlorine dioxide is an oxidizer that itself is destroyed when it steals electrons, but it can steal more electrons than other oxidizers in the human body. •\t A molecule of chlorine dioxide can destroy up to 5 molecules of other substances. That is, for example, more than twice what oxygen can do, and chlorine dioxide can penetrate much deeper into the tissues to do it. Of course, it’s only my opinion that MMS is destroying the ARVs, but something has to be happening, as over 800 people who were taking both MMS and ARVs are now well and feeling good. They have had their complaints investigated by their doctors in the local hospital. It is agreed that they are well. We have the reports. It says on the ARV box or the paper slip that ARVs will not correct oppor - tunistic diseases, yet these diseases are gone in people who take MMS. So the next extrapolation is that I expect MMS to destroy the toxins in vaccines, while killing the diseases that are also buried there. There is no room here to tell you the terrible things they are doing to the vaccines, but you can investigate it yourself if you wish. Just do an internet search and of course read the next chapter on Vaccines . #####"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"  Dear Jim, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes two years ago.

So I am not going to try to prove anything to you, but rather give you some important information to consider, very important. The\t first\t thing\t you\t might\t check\t for\t yourself\t is\t the\t latest\t controversy\t now\t on\t TV\t at\t this\t date\t of\t 1/6/20011.\t Dr.\t Andrew\t Wakefield , MB, BS, FRCS, FRCPath, is an academic gastroenterologist; he is a completely conventional doctor being worked over by CNN trying to prove that he is a liar because he is saying autism is caused by vaccines. They are saying he faked the data. They have to say that, as there is no opposing data. CNN tries to appear unbiased, but they spend a minute or two on his actual data and then ten times as much time on how he has been accused of lying. CNN personnel are extremely unprofessional and irresponsible to claim he is lying when they have no data to the contrary. If\t you\t go\t to\t the\t internet\t and\t read\t about\t vaccination,\t you\t will\t find\t many learned people writing about it. You will notice that each of these people is saying that vaccination is absolutely a great thing. Doctor after doctor will tell you that vaccination has reduced the incidence of many infectious diseases . Just look at the extremely high percentage of infectious diseases around 1900, they say, and now, after the advent of vaccination, those diseases have all dropped\t to\t tiny,\t almost\t insignificant\t percentages\t of\t what\t they\t had\t been.\t Although\t each\t of\t these\t people\t will\t confirm\t the\t tremendous\t value\t of\t vaccinations\t and\t talk\t about\t the\t scientific\t proof\t and\t the\t huge\t field\t of\t scientific\t evidence,\t there\t is\t in\t fact\t no\t scientific\t proof.\t Again\t there are all those missing scientific papers mentioned in Chapter 22, MMS, ARVs, and Vaccines . Measles as an Example But let me help you check if for yourself. Take measles as an example. In 1900 there were 13 deaths for each 100,000 of the U.S. population. By 1963 there was less than one death per 100,000. With the proper chart, that can be made to look good for vaccination, but you may have guessed it -- vaccination for measles was introduced in 1963. After it was introduced, the number of deaths continued to decline,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"184 Vaccines but\t not\t significantly,\t and\t not\t at\t any\t accelerated\t speed.\t There\t are\t no\t graphs proving there was a big reduction in measles deaths after the introduction of measles vaccines. •\t The decrease in measles deaths matched the improved living conditions of the cities, the better nutrition , the improved trash collection and waste disposal. Improved Living Conditions The exact same thing happened in England and Europe. Nor was it just measles -- all the infectious diseases have similar graphs. The tremendous reduction in disease followed modern civilization in the improvement of living conditions and hygiene. No disease incidence graph shows any particular reduction in deaths after the introduction of its vaccine. To illustrate this, let me give you a picture of New York in about 1900. Keep in mind that all cities were described the same way at that time. I quote Roman Bystrianyk in her article Historic Data Shows Vaccines Not Key in Declines of Death from Disease. “Now imagine a world where workplaces had no health, safety, or minimum wage laws. It was a time where people put in 12 to 16 hours a day at the most tedious menial labor. Imagine bands of children roaming the streets out of control because their parents are laboring long days. Picture the city of New York surrounded not by suburbs, but by rings of smoldering garbage dumps and shantytowns. Imagine cities where hogs, horses, and dogs and their refuse were commonplace in the streets. Many infectious diseases were rampant throughout the world and in particular in the large cities. This is not a description of the third world, but was a large portion of America and other western cities only a century or so ago.” The decline of disease in every case came from hundreds of societal improvements, such as: •\t The invention of sewers •\t Improved living conditions •\t Improved working conditions •\t Better garbage disposal •\t Cleaning of refuse from the streets"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"185     Vaccines The decline in incidence of each disease came before the advent of its vaccination, with the exception of smallpox. However, there is no proof that smallpox vaccinations helped. For years in England, hundreds died from smallpox vaccinations and only one or two from smallpox each year. Despite strict vaccination laws a hundred years ago, with thousands vaccinated, hundreds of thousands neverthe - less died from smallpox. The doctors and drug companies would like you to think (and maybe a few of them have even convinced themselves) that vaccinations are responsible for the reduction in deaths. They produce statistics that would convince a master thief, but they simply cannot compete with the truth and facts. Some True Disease Statistics There is currently an epidemic of Type 2 diabetes in progress. One in 100 children has autism. Further: •\t 1 in 5 have asthma •\t 1 in 10 have dyslexia •\t 1 to 8 in 1,000 have epilepsy •\t 1 in 400 to 1 in 166 have cerebral palsy 1 in 20 have attention\tdeficit\tdisorder For sources of these statistic check CDC FastStats . The government/vaccine industry is going to carry on vaccinating, covering up, and making false safety claims until every child has a vaccine-induced disease. So we of the Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing must do everything we can to stop this evil, and we will. To see more detail on vaccines, please read: The Vaccination Racket at www.whale.to/b/hoax1.html#16.__Vaccination_as_sacrament . That article gives hundreds of pages of details and references on the evils of vaccinations and the terrible harm they are doing to our children.

Bishop Jim Humble #####"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"187 Methods Other Than Oral of Using MMS Methods Other Than Oral of Using MMS A lthough this book focuses on taking MMS orally, it can be brought into the body in a variety of other ways. Chapter 14, Healing Diseases , describes using it for skin problems and for dental and respiratory health. I’ll give more details here. Remember, chlorine dioxide is the most powerful killer of pathogens known to man. This is true whether it is used in swimming pools, on slaughterhouse\t floors,\t or\t by\t the\t immune\t system\t of\t an\t animal\t or\t a\t human.\tIn\taddition,\tit\tis\tthe\tmost\tpowerful\tdetoxifier\tknown.\t Please see Chapter 13 on MMS Protocols for the best ways to use MMS according to the problem being treated. The protocols call for drinking a calibrated dose but below are suggestions for MMS use that can supplement any of the protocols. \t An MMS Bath The skin is the body’s biggest organ and can absorb MMS easily. Run a hot bath and add anywhere from 5 to 20 drops of activated MMS.\t If\t the\t water\t is\t not\t filtered,\t run\t it\t hot\t and\t let\t the\t vapor\t rise\t for\t a few minutes. Stay in the bath for about 10 minutes. Depending on your tolerance for MMS dosages, you could go up to about 40 drops. Don’t be concerned about the tub of water diluting the MMS a lot. Whatever number of drops you put in the water will come in contact with your skin regardless of how full the tub is or how large it is. \t An MMS Footbath If you have a toenail fungus or any sort of foot wound or infection ,\t fill\t a footbath with hot water and add 10 to 20 drops of activated MMS. Soak your feet for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat this daily until the condition is healed. It could take one week, or up to 6 weeks, depending on what the problem is. Some people have reported good pain relief for gout using this procedure. Also, this is a good way to just get more MMS into the body for supplementing the Protocols 1000 , 2000 , and 3000 . \t Unactivated MMS ◊\t For itchy insect bites such as from mosquitoes and fleas use only one drop of unactivated MMS. Insect bites are acidic in nature and since MMS is alkaline, it"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"188 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS can neutralize the acid, thus stopping the itch. Rub the one\t drop\t in\t with\t the\t end\t of\t your\t finger\t or\t a\t Q-tip.\t Use\t no more than 2 drops total. ◊\t For skin burns including sunburn . Being alkaline, MMS will cancel out the pain of a burn which comes from the acidity of burned skin. ◊\t Do not apply oil or greasy lotions, as by sealing the burned area, they can worsen the injury. Apply the unactivated MMS to the burn liberally and immediately spread\t it\t with\t your\t fingers\t (but\t gently).\t Leave\t it\t there\t for\t no more than 5 minutes and then rinse it off with clean water. The pain will usually be gone in 3 or 4 minutes but if it is not, do a second treatment. Do not leave it longer than 5 minutes as you will cause much more damage. Use aloe vera ointment or aloe vera juice for healing after treatment. \t Four Treatments Per Hour For a snake bite, mix 3 or 4 drops with an equal number of 50% citric acid drops and apply it to the bite every 15 minutes. Also take 6-drop MMS doses every 15 minutes for half an hour and every half hour thereafter for several hours. See a doctor but do not let him cut the bite, as the cut will spread the poison. Most doctors know better but a few do not. \t MMS Fumes on the Skin For a staphylococcus infection, do this carefully, as it can save your life or someone else’s life in a few minutes. Obtain a glass or cup or smaller vessel of a size to cover the infected area and not allow any gas to get out. It must not be metal. Put 10 drops of MMS and 10 drops of 50% citric acid in the vessel and mix. Do not add water. Immediately put the mouth of the vessel over the infected area but do it so that the MMS remains in the bottom. Lean your body so that the vessel is not upside down. Allow the chlorine dioxide fumes to bathe the infected area for five minutes, no longer . The gas will burn your skin otherwise. At\t the\t end\t of\t five\t minutes,\t remove\t the\t vessel\t holding\t the\t MMS\t and\t try to lightly squeeze the infection so that pus comes out. Keep paper towels handy to clean up the mess. If pus does not come out, wait several hours and repeat the procedure. This will normally handle staph infection s in one treatment, but if not, repeat the procedure"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"189 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS every 6 hours until handled. \t MMS Skin Spray For skin cancers, make a spray using 10 drops of activated MMS for each ounce of water. Spray the cancer each hour and spray DMSO on\t top\t of\t the\t MMS\t spray.\t Brush\t it\t with\t your\t fingers\t lightly.\t Do\t this\t once an hour. At the same time, follow Protocol 2000 as described in Chapter 13. If this makes your normal skin sore or the cancer painful, stop spraying until you can spray again with no pain. \t MMS Via an IV Line After some experience with this method of using MMS, I discovered that it is not more effective than taking it by mouth. However, if a person’s mouth and/or digestive system is injured, an IV drip will work. To a 250 ml saline or sugar solution, add 5 drops of unactivated MMS. Wait for an hour before using this while the liquid solution gradually activates the MMS. Then allow it to infuse slowly into the body. We allowed anywhere from 1 to 3 hours and from 5 to 22 drops per infusion, but normally you would use the same number of drops by infusion as you would by mouth. Always wait an hour after loading the IV bag. Of course, the larger the dose, the longer you should allow for the infusion. If you are following Protocol 1000 , use an MMS dose that will allow you to meter in 3 drops an hour, and for Protocol 2000, use as many drops an hour as you would be using by mouth. \t MMS in an Enema Use\t 10\t drops\t of\t MMS\t in\t 8\t ounces\t of\t fluid.\t Hold\t it\t in\t for\t 5\t to\t 10\t minutes if you can. Or do the enema any way you are accustomed to doing it but add about one drop of activated MMS per ounce of water. You could also go to someone who does colonics and have them add about one drop of activated MMS per ounce of solution that they use ◊\t Constipation MMS often handles constipation , but not always. There seems to be a small percentage of people who have been constipated for so many years that killing the pathogens in the colon does not help. I have run into a few, including myself. In most cases"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"190 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS colonics and proper eating and special programs will handle the problem, but not always. Sometimes the operation of the colon has come to a partial or complete standstill. In this, case the colon is probably partially or completely paralyzed. I have treated many such people, usually older people, but again not always. The paralysis of the colon has usually been a result of years of not functioning properly and killing the pathogens unfortunately does not result in proper function. So I have used the Senna herb. This is the only herb that totally exercises the muscles in the colon. It has helped many people and millions are now using it. It has helped many be healthy again. Use Senna for relief from constipation if MMS has not worked. It is effective and the closest thing I know to the natural way. You can buy it from health food stores and Walmart and many other large food chains. You can buy a bottle of senna extract that\t works\t fine\t containing\t 250\t pills\t and\t also\t smaller\t size\t bottles as well. The Codex laws have made them use smaller pills, but just take more pills as needed. Begin with two or three pills and keep increasing until it works. You may have to take as many as 20 or 25. I now take 9 but I have been using less and less. I once was taking the equivalent of 20. For those who have had this problem for years, use senna for relief, then do the MMS Protocol 1000 while also taking the\t senna.\t When\t finished\t with\t the\t protocol,\t you\t can\t continue\t using senna if necessary. There are millions of people using it now and it keeps them completely healthy. Most people will not\t have\t to\t continue\t it\t indefinitely\t but\t a\t rare\t few\t will\t need\t it\t and it will work for them. \t Inhaling MMS Fumes Caveat Follow these instructions! Your lungs have no pain nerves and you can damage them without feeling it. Inhaling chlorine dioxide fumes must be done very cautiously. Never, never use more than 2 activated drops for inhaling . Step #1: Put 2 drops of MMS in a cup, add the activator and cover the cup."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"191 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS Step #2: Wait 20 seconds for the 50% citric acid or 3 minutes for the 10% citric, then remove the lid and lift the cup to your nose. Step #3: Take one breath through your nose. The minute you feel it bite, stop your breath. Step #4: Take one breath through your mouth. Take no more than\t one\t breath\t at\t first.\t You\t should\t cough.\t It\t is\t what\t you\t need\t to\t do. Then you should cough the next morning. You need to get the stuff out of your lungs and coughing does that. Typically, not a lot of coughing is needed. Treating your lungs directly has the advantage that the MMS getting to your lungs is a hundred times stronger than what you would get from drinking it, then letting it go to your stomach, get into your blood and\t finally\t work\t its\t way\t to\t your\t lungs through the circulatory system. It\twill\tfinally\tget\tto\tthe\tlungs\tbut\tthe\thealing\twill\tbe\tslower. You will quickly learn to use a few breaths two or three times a day, but only very slowly. I can’t emphasize enough that you must go slowly , working up to several breaths in the morning and in the evening. Gradually, your lungs will begin to heal. Keep in mind that this technique is using chlorine dioxide at just about 100% strength. The fumes coming off the bottom of that cup are 100% chlorine dioxide, but they do mix with a small amount of air on the way up. Two Cautionary Tales Tale #1: I once told a person over the phone how to do this. He was very sure that he needed to go faster. So he used 4 drops instead of 2, but what he really did wrong was continue to breathe the fumes for almost half an hour. It felt good, he said. Four hours later that afternoon, he was gasping for breath. He could hardly force air into his lungs because he had burned them. He was afraid that he had permanently harmed them. I told him that he would be alright but that it would take several days to recover and that is what happened. It was a bad experience. He really thought he was going to die. Don’t you have the same experience! Go slowly! You can indeed harm your lungs. Tale #2: Just the other day one of the Ministers here was making a six-drop dose to take. After putting the 6 drops in a coffee cup and adding 6 drops of citric acid, before adding the water, he dropped his pen. He was sitting in a chair and without thinking,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"192 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS he bent over between his legs to pick up the pen. As he reached for it, he was holding the coffee cup in his other hand and his nose went into the cup as he picked up the pen. He was just drawing a breath. It hit him hard. He coughed very hard for several minutes and then he seemed to be OK. But 4 hours later he was wheezing and he could hardly get a breath. It scared him. He had a hard time that evening, but by the next day he was OK. I tell you this to emphasize that if you use this technique, go slowly. * * * Warning When using the above instructions to repair your lungs , you take complete responsibility for yourself. I cannot be responsible for you. All I can say is that I have done this and others have told me they have too. In many cases, this is the only thing that will give you your life back. But you do it totally on your own responsibility. * * * \t Using a Misting Machine Another and much safer procedure is to use a mister, a machine that\t creates\t a\t mist\t of\t water.\t Some\t humidifiers\t also\t create\t a\t cool\t mist; read your user’s manual. I use 24 drops of activated MMS for each cup of water that I put in the mister. MMS will be in the mist. Use bottled drinking water. Keep a large bottle so that you can pour the liquid out of the machine and into a bottle with a lid. In that way, after you have taken your breaths, you can continue to use the same MMS until it gets used up. Make up a batch for your machine. You will probably need at least three cups. Remember: 24 drops of activated MMS per cup. Turn the machine on and put your mouth right down at the opening where the mist comes out. You will be able to tell when the mist starts as the\t air\t will\t get\t cold\t on\t your\t lips.\t At\t that\t time,\t the\t first\t time,\t take\t only\t one breath. Then 4 hours later you can do it again and if everything went alright and there was no problem, you can take 2 breaths. Do it two or three times a day and if there is no problem and you are getting better, you can take as many as 10 breaths each time. You"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"193 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS will never be getting 100% chlorine dioxide as you would if breathing from a cup. But in every case go slowly. Inhaling MMS in a mist is very helpful for any type of respiratory disease such as pneumonia , asthma, COPD, and emphysema . I have been using MMS for my lungs from time to time. As others have\t told\t me\t about\t using\t MMS\t in\t the\t lungs,\t I\t finally\t decided\t to\t do\t a mini research program. The above item (Inhaling MMS) and this one, Using a Misting Machine, are the result of about 2 weeks of doing it 8 hours a day. I am 79 years old as mentioned before. About one month after doing the mini program, I began to feel my lungs working easier and I was breathing more deeply on occasion. Then I began to take more deep breaths. I was amazed. I could draw breaths completely and easily. Before doing the program, I breathed OK. But when taking a deep breath, my breath would just slowly come to an end. As I reached the end of the breath I was forcing it pretty hard. Now it was different. I could breathe all the way totally deep to the end of the breath easily and without forcing it. In fact it was now fun and pleasant to take a deep breath, hold it for a couple of seconds and then let it out. I\t figure\t that\t the\t lungs\t heal\t slowly.\t After\t I\t killed\t most\t of\t the\t pathogens , my\t lungs\t filled\t out\t to\t a\t healthier\t condition\t than\t before.\t It\t took\t a\t while.\t They didn’t feel bad before, but they do feel better now. No big deal, but it might be worth working on. * * * Warning When using the above instructions to repair your lungs, you take complete responsibility for yourself. I cannot be responsible for you.

Using an eye dropper, put one or two drops in the affected eye or eyes. Blink a few times to be sure the liquid penetrates into the eye thoroughly and use a second drop if needed. Do this 4 or 5 times a day until the eye is well. \t Gargling MMS By gargling MMS daily as part of your dental hygiene, you can prevent all types of throat infection . The full dental procedure is described in Chapter 13 under Daily Procedure for Dental and Respiratory Health . Gargling is the last step. •\t After\t briefly\t and\t gently\t inhaling\t the\t fumes from 2 drops of MMS and then brushing your teeth with the diluted dose, add about a quarter cup of water to the two tablespoons of solution that are still in the glass and gargle. \t MMS in a Douche Use 6 drops of activated MMS per cup of water. You may want to use two cups so that would be a total of 12 drops. Just do your regular douche but with the added MMS. For bad infections, use the same number of drops per cup but do up to one douche every hour. \t MMS in a Bag You may chuckle at the image of this procedure, but if the mouth and/or digestive system is injured, this is another way to get MMS into the whole body. Get two large trash bags and tape their openings together. I have found these trash bags in various supermarkets around the world. They are all about the same size. It’s the largest trash bag all the markets\t sell.\t Lay\t two\t of\t the\t bags\t on\t the\t floor\t with\t the\t openings\t against one another. Tape the bags together with no open places. Turn the bags over and tape both sides to make sure the gas will not get out. Cut the opposite end out of one of the bags and now you have one large bag at least 6 feet tall or taller. For the application stage, put a stool near a table. Use a small bowl for the MMS. On the table near your stool have the bowl, some MMS, and some citric acid. It is best to use 50% citric as it releases chlorine dioxide faster than a 10% solution. Also have a clock or"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"195 Methods Other Than Oralof Using MMS watch to time your treatment. When you are ready, take most of your clothes off, sit on the stool, and put your feet in the bag. Pull it up at least waist high. Then and only then make up your bowl of MMS for the chlorine dioxide. The first\t time,\t use\t 5\t drops\t of\t MMS\t and\t 5\t drops\t of\t citric\t acid.\t Mix\t them\t in\t the bowl and immediately put the bowl inside the bag down at your feet. Do not wait any time after putting the MMS and citric together. Put it down at your feet immediately, pull the bag up to your neck and hold it closed around your neck. •\t Be sure to time yourself and stay in the bag only 10 minutes . If you wear any clothes, you may ruin them. Unless it is winter time and you are outside, you will sweat a lot. Do this several times a day or more. Use from 5 to 40 drops of MMS. Do not start with 40 drops but work your way up to it. You can be on Protocol 1000 or 2000 while doing this although that is not a requirement. If you add this procedure to one of the other protocols that is OK, but do not make yourself nauseous. That prevents your recovery or slows it down considerably. #####"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" Dear Jim, I was a very young-looking 60 years old in 2005.

We had a contract with a number of provisions in it, and he had broken every one of them and it would be easy enough for me to prove that, so I decided to bug out. I went to Mexico to a nice big house on the Sea of Cortez, in a small city called Keno. The owner was Ed Heft. He is a pretty amazing guy. He has spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars studying alternate medicine and he has much data and equipment from men in the present and from men in the past who were able to cure various diseases. Whenever he heard of someone who was helping people or had new ways to treat disease, he would travel to see them. He somehow found out about me while I was still in Nevada. When he called me one day, we talked on the phone for several hours, and when I mentioned that I needed a place to go, he immediately invited me to Mexico. Within a week I was headed for Mexico in my Chevy S10 pickup with just about everything I owned in the world. It was all quite fun and that was how I got to Mexico. Ed said, “Consider this your home,” and his invitation was for an indefinite\t period.\t My\t decision\t to\t “bug\t out”\t was\t based\t on\t his\t invitation\t and on the fact that I wanted to separate from that partner. There was also the fact that I was a little worried about what the FDA would be thinking about my book. I had a friend who was in jail for saying that certain minerals are good for you -- of course, he sold some of those minerals, and I don’t sell MMS, but I didn’t want to go to jail. The main consideration was that I needed to write a book to tell people about MMS and I did not intend to hold anything back. The information was far too important for any one person to try to control and I had to make sure that no one ever got control of it. I had listened to the partner I was leaving, who was determined that we would control MMS in all of Africa, and realized that if he did what he was planning, there would always be millions of people left out of the loop.

There were a few radio companies on the internet who heard about my book and they announced it. Some people who had large telephone audiences had me on to lecture and very soon the book was selling, and my friend in Nevada was shipping books every day. Of course, I began paying her a salary. She decided that she liked the job and a great business relationship was born from the existing friendship. She was the lady who helped me out with the English in the\t first\t book\t and\t I\t also\t mention\t her\t in\t that\t book.\t Her\t name\t is\t Clara\t Tate. Colleagues and Progress With the book money, I was able to have a better website put up and\t that\t helped\t out\t as\t well.\t Once\t I\t finished\t the\t book\t and\t it\t was\t beginning to sell, I met another Clara in Mexico. She was a school teacher and she did many jobs for Ed, helping him get papers for his house and insurance and a dozen other things. She got excited about MMS the minute she heard about it. So I gave her some and she began treating people at her house in Hermosillo about 60 miles away. She began getting fabulous results with many people, including her daughter, who had appendicitis and was healed in several hours. After a few weeks and maybe as many as 50 people treated in her home of all sorts of health problems, we got to talking and decided to start a business selling MMS in Mexico. I couldn’t do it out by the sea. There wasn’t much there so I decided"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"199     Mexico to move to Hermosillo. We decided to rent a large house where we would live and base the business and we spent a few days looking for\t one.\t But\t her\t mother\t finally\t pointed\t out\t that\t we\t were\t not\t ready\t to\t rent a house and that I would best move in with them for a time while we got the business going. So I moved in with a Mexican family. Of course I paid rent and food money, but they treated me like a king. They were nice and cooked food that I liked and I helped with various things. We used my Chevy S10 for quite a while. Clara’s sister, Denisse, was acting as my secretary and she was beginning to help me with emails as she learned about MMS. Of course there were many errands to do around town including my trips to the bank and my secretary would go with me as a guide. Denisse started to complain about my driving and how I was driving too fast. So about the third day of complaining, I gave her the car keys and said, “You drive.” Well, she drove about as fast as me, but at 74 years old I was tired of driving, so after that, one of the two girls, Clara or Denisse, drove me everywhere I went. I didn’t have to drive\tand\tthat\twas\tfine\twith\tme. The James V. Humble Association Clara introduced me to a doctor she knew in town and we got along pretty well. His name is Dr. Romero. He began to use MMS and we decided\t to\t start\t a\t non-profit\t Mexican\t Association\t that\t would\t prove\t that MMS really works. They found out that I could not be part of it, as I was not a Mexican citizen, but I could be an unpaid consultant. So that is what I became, although the name of the Mexican Association was\t the\t James\t V.\t Humble\t Association.\t I\t financed\t everything\t with\t the\t book sales, including the legal work. There was a vacant house across the street from us that had quite a bit of damage, as vacant houses usually do. The owners said if we wanted\t to\t fix\t it\t up,\t we\t could\t use\t it\t for\t a\t year\t or\t so.\t I\t spent\t $15,000\t getting\t it\t fixed\t up,\t and\t it\t looked\t better\t than\t our\t house\t when\t it\t was\t done. We then had some of the association meetings there. The basic reason for the association was to treat people, especially HIV patients, to prove the effectiveness of MMS. We did treat 4 people who\t finally\t tested\t negative\t for\t HIV.\t For\t one\t reason\t or\t another\t we\t never really got the clinical trials going beyond the four. We had a clinic that looked pretty good, but no patients. My S10 was always parked in front of the house across the street in"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"200 Mexico the little parking area. Well one day I walked out to do something and it was gone. We called the police and they spotted it. As they were chasing it, one police car tried to stop it from in front. The thief banged into the police and destroyed their car and my S10, and believe it or not,\t the\t Mexican\t insurance\t finally\t paid\t off.\t I\t bought\t another\t car,\t a\t nice Nissan passenger car as we did not need a pickup. A Congress in Germany I was invited to Germany to receive a check and to speak to an audience about MMS. It was an oxidation congress and there were many people there involved in ways of killing disease using techniques other than MMS. I decided to take Clara with me as my secretary. We stayed with various people while in Germany and I spoke at the congress. My speech and question and answer time was well accepted and many people shook my hand and said that they came to the congress specifically\t to\t see\t me.\t That\t was\t nice\t and\t one\t fellow\t gave\t me\t a\t check for a couple of thousand dollars that was a royalty for MMS bottles he had sold. The date of that Congress was November 21, 2008. We returned to Mexico November 23, 2008. That trip was very good and the main thing that I did while there was meet and talk with Thomas Kirschner, the man who translated my book into German. He had sold over 50,000 books at that time and by now has sold over 150,000. There are quite a number of people using MMS in Germany at this time. It is\t sold\t there,\t as\t in\t many\t other\t countries,\t as\t water\t purification drops, but of course, those people who buy it know that it is for improving their health. MMS and Pancreatic Cancer Clara’s ex husband, Jeorge Ruiz, is sort of a computer whiz. His uncle began to email him about how bad his pancreatic cancer was getting and he asked me about the MMS and of course, I told him that the MMS had a very good chance of helping him. Well, the cancer continued to get worse. His uncle lives quite a ways further south in Mexico. Finally he decided that he must go treat his uncle because his uncle had given up. The doctor had given him a few weeks to live. Clara and I gave him a couple of bottles of MMS1 and some"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"201     Mexico capsules of MMS2 (we were using MMS2 in Mexico about a year before I released it to the world as I wanted experience before telling everyone) and we put him on an airplane. Of course we tutored him on what to do when he got there. When he arrived there, his uncle was lying in bed and had given up. He no longer cared, but Jeorge was determined. The\t first\t thing\t he\t did\t was\t to\t sit\t his\t uncle\t up\t and\t give\t him\t a\t dose\t of\t 6\t drops of MMS1. Then he began to apply MMS mixed with DMSO to his uncle’s body. For several days he did that every few hours, giving his uncle MMS1 every hour and MMS2 every other hour. This was a vigorous assault on that cancer and it worked. Within three days Jeorge’s uncle was up and walking around the yard. In less than a week, Jeorge came home because he had trained his Uncle on what to do. In a week, his uncle was talking about going back to work, and in fact he did go back to work after about 4 weeks. Jeorge was so enthused about seeing his uncle get well that he said this was the work he wanted to do for the rest of his life. So I hired him to work with Clara. They were starting to get along pretty well and I had them both do my Acceptance Procedure which they said helped them a lot to understand one another. Please see the Acceptance Procedure on www.jimhumble.biz . A Dubious New Partner In Mexico we mainly continued to answer emails from around the world. I and my secretary, Denisse, have answered over 50,000 emails since 2005. I received one from a man named John Stewart who said that he wanted to come see me in person, and of course I agreed. When he arrived, he told me that he was connected with the U.N. and that he could get them to put up billions of dollars to cure people in Africa. He wanted to help me get Africa handled so far as malaria is concerned. He said that he would buy a yacht so that I could live in safety. He had some very great plans and I bought the idea that he could implement them. He talked like he already had plenty of money to get things going. At the time, there was no mention that he had to prove to the U.N. that MMS worked. He just said that he could get it all done. We first\t started\t talking\t in\t the\t last\t days\t of\t October\t 2008.\t He\t said\t he\t thought\t everything\t would\tbe\t done\t and\t ready\t in\t the\t first\t two\t weeks\t of November. Then he and I would go somewhere in the world,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"202 Mexico financed\tby\tthe\tUN,\tto\tdo\ta\tproject\tto\tprove\tthe\tMMS\treally\tworks.\t When\t we\t first\t talked,\t there\t was\t no\t mention\t of\t a\t contract\t between\t him and me. He just wanted to know if it was OK that we worked together. Well, dozens of people around the world work with me so I assumed that getting it all done was just a way of helping the world and John would get some contracts on the side. Then the time frame slid to the last part of November, then to the first\t part\t of\t December,\t then\t for\t sure\t before\t Christmas,\t then\t finally\t the\t first\t of\t the\t year.\t I\t was\t invited\t to\t Panama\t to\t sign\t the\t contract.\t Of\t course, it would be silly of me to think we would do anything without a contract, so I agreed. In Panama, several U.N. people were there, but John said that for my protection, I should not know their names, and he would not tell them my name. He said that these people were not asking for proof that MMS works because they already believed it did. He just wanted me to explain MMS and talk about it a little, as they needed some help. I talked to them for a while and they were very excited. I signed a contract in Panama making John and I partners, as I believed he was going to immediately have billions of dollars to treat all of Africa for malaria . No Exclusive Rights? All the time I told John I would not agree to anything that gave him or anyone else exclusive rights to MMS. But somehow I found out later that in the contract he had exclusive rights to MMS worldwide. The problem is, although I asked him many times, he and his lawyer would never give me a copy of the contract. They have told me that it gives him exclusive rights to MMS, but they have for one reason or another refused to ever give me a copy. I\t didn’t\t get\t a\t copy\t at\t the\t signing\t in\t the\t law\t office\t in\t Panama\t because\t they said that absolute security was tremendously important, but of course, I would get a copy just before I left Panama. The idea was that I should not leave a copy of the contract in my room and to carry it around with me would be cumbersome. They were just keeping it safe\tat\tthe\tlaw\toffice.\tBut\tthey\tnever\tgave\tme\ta\tcopy. John said that I was his partner and he said it was 50-50. Now I am telling you this even though I am embarrassed to write it, sitting here at the computer. If I don’t tell you, someone else will and that will make it sound worse than it really was. This businessman had"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"203     Mexico convinced me that he was getting billions from the UN and that I was his 50% partner and that we would run the business of getting the MMS delivered to Africa together. It sounded really great, and billions of dollars can confuse you, if you are not careful. But in fact, John was not really connected to the UN. A Series of Broken Promises After the signing of our contract, I thought we would start doing things together, but John bugged out to Florida where he lives, and started dealing with all those people he needs to deal with, and I was left completely out of the picture. I found out later that he was telling people he had a contract with me that gave him exclusive rights to MMS and that was why he didn’t need me there working with him. I had no say in anything. I wasn’t a partner. I was a guy at a distance that didn’t even get an email once a week telling me how things were going. Although they wouldn’t give me a copy of the contract I signed, someone sent me a single page of it with my initials on it and amazingly, it did give John exclusive rights to MMS. I remembered the lawyer handing me a page and saying, “You forgot to initial this one, Jim”. Well, anyone who has read much of my writing knows that I would never allow anyone to get exclusive control of MMS, so the fact that they have an initialed page giving John exclusive control of MMS is ridiculous. I introduced John to a friend of mine, Russell Perry, and John agreed to pay him a certain amount of money if he would work in Ghana to get some clinical trials completed. Well, the trials were completed but John never paid Russell. Then John traveled to Ghana and promised the doctors in a hospital there to pay for tests to be conducted in the hospital, but -- you guessed it, John never paid for the tests. This same story has gone on and on with John making promises and not keeping them. I don’t know what the contract is that I signed with John Stewart, as I have been unable to obtain a copy to this day. But whatever it was, I hereby refute that entire contract and any agreement whatsoever. Whatever it is, I declare it null and void. If\t you\t have\t read\t my\t first\t book,\t you\t know\t who\t Arnold\t was.\t He\t was\t a\t partner who tried to get exclusive control and was always telling me I had no say in how things would be done. Now here I was again with another Arnold. He and his lawyer were telling me John had exclusive"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"204 Mexico right to MMS. And John was running the whole affair without giving me any say so at all. It wouldn’t have been nearly so bad if he had been\tsuccessful,\tbut\the\twas\tflunking\tbadly,\tfailing\tat\tevery\tturn.\t A Second, Ineffective “MMS” So when I went out of sight to work in Africa (see Chapters 26 and 27 on South Africa and Malawi ), I quit communicating with John. And he doesn’t know where I am. So he is telling at least one US Congress - woman from California that he has exclusive rights to MMS, but he can’t produce me to prove it or maybe he has changed the name of the solution and is telling her it is his. In Ghana I am told that John removed my MMS from the tests being conducted and replaced it with his MMS, and I was told that he changed the name. When they gave the patients John’s solution, they became sicker and they had to quit using it. So far as I am concerned, that is the ultimate of betrayal. John was putting lives at risk for the sake of substituting his solution for mine. Anyway, I know the clinical trials have all been shut down in Ghana mainly because John did not produce any of the money he promised. I don’t know what the Congresswoman knows at this time and I don’t know whether she knows about me or not. There is no way he can have exclusive legal rights to MMS, as I gave\t them\t away\t to\t the\t world\t in\t my\t first\t book\t before\t I\t met\t John.\t I\t will\t never let him or anyone else gain exclusive rights, and I don’t see how\t he\t can\t do\t it.\t The\t first\t book\t was\t written\t long\t before\t that\t contract\t was\t signed.\t At\t this\t time\t I\t just\t finished\t treating\t 800\t HIV\t cases\t suc - cessfully and John is out of the picture. An Offer From Morocco Right after I got back from Panama in that later part of January 2008, a doctor \t from\t Morocco\t began\t emailing\t me\t and\t finally\t wanted\t me\t to come to Morocco. He offered to pay for the trip. I didn’t realize that he was actually broke, so I accepted his offer to pay as he said that there were many people who wanted me to teach them about MMS.\t I\t received\t an\t internet\t ticket\t and\t printed\t it\t out\t and\t finally\t left\t for\t Morocco on about February 5, 2009. When I reached Mexico City on my\t flight\t out\t of\t the\t country,\t the\t clerk\t said\t my\t ticket\t was\t no\t good,\t that\t it had not been paid for. So I was obliged to pay the ticket on the spot or\tthey\twould\tnot\tallow\tme\ton\tthe\tscheduled\tflight.\t"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"205     Mexico What had actually happened is that he had ordered a ticket from the agency that knew him and they had issued the ticket, but when he didn’t pay, they cancelled it. Anyway, I arrived in Morocco and he met me at the airport. In the next few days, I met some of his friends who wanted to know about MMS. One notable doctor was out of the city a hundred miles or so. We visited him and stayed with him several days. He had been a doctor in that town for about 40 years and had a very large luxurious house with servants. When we ate, it was only the three of us, as women never eat with the men. The table was loaded with dozens of different kinds of food. We never saw his wife or anyone else. The\t amount\t of\t food\t served\t to\t the\t three\t of\t us\t would\t fill\t at\t least\t ten\t people. This was just normal for the doctor. He lived in absolute luxury but he was also genuinely concerned for each of his patients. I treated several of them successfully and he seemed interested in using MMS in his practice. Finally my doctor friend said that we should travel to the country of Niger, because he had friends at a large clinic there where we could treat 100 malaria cases in a few days. Well, at that time I had John, who was supposed to be my partner in the UN, who needed to have some cured malaria cases to show to the UN. Please Treat 100 Malaria Cases John said that if I could treat 100 cases with before-and-after blood tests, we could most likely get a few million dollars and the country could begin treating everyone with malaria. I am fairly sure that things were actually set up at that time to bring about that situation. There were people in the UN who were tired of doing nothing and they had enough power to say, “We don’t care about the medical route where everything has to be proven with millions of dollars of testing. Just prove to us that it works and we will go with it.” So I paid for both our tickets to Niger. In Niger we were accepted by a friend of my friend and given a place to stay for a few days. The next morning we went to his clinic where he had worked for 5 years, and\t we\t treated\t five\t patients\t there\t for\t malaria.\t They\t used\t before- and-after blood tests and the results were successful. We explained that we were connected with the UN at that time and we needed 100 proven cases of malaria, using before-and-after blood tests for the proof of success. They said, “No problem. We can"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"206 Mexico do it in a couple of days. You just need permission from the health department. I’ll just get my friend to help you push the permission through. You should be through by tomorrow.” Soon his friend arrived and\t asked\t us\t to\t come\t to\t his\t office\t that\t afternoon\t and\t he\t would\t have\t a\thealth\tofficial\tthere.\t Meanwhile, my friend who brought me said he had to leave to conduct some sort of classes in Morocco. So I was left by myself in\t that\t country.\t I\t arrived \tat\t the\t business\t person’s\t office\t where\t the\t health\t official\t was\t supposed\t to\t be\t and\t sure\t enough,\t an\t official\t was\t there. He asked what papers I had and I showed him some papers giving the content of the MMS. I explained the situation about the UN\t to\t him.\t I\t said\t that\t I\t could\t have\t a\t UN\t official\t telephone\t the\t health\t minister in his country. He said OK, but he still needed to test the MMS. He mentioned a couple of more tests and said he would talk to me the next day. I thought maybe he was waiting for the telephone call, so I asked my people at the UN to get someone to call the Health Minister in Niger. That call went through but they still needed time to do some testing and get approval. Later, I learned that the testing and approval were just marking time while the businessman worked me for money. They could care less that there were millions of dollars available for their country -- what they wanted was money from me for themselves. They wanted cash in hand, but they also wanted me to go\t into\t business\t with\t them.\t I,\t of\t course,\t would\t finance\t the\t business.\t I didn’t realize it right away. I thought they were about to give me permission to do 100 malaria cases, especially since they already had\t the\t 5\t cases\t that\t I\t did\t the\t first\t day.\t No,\t they\t wanted\t cash\t from\t me. But Where Are Your Papers? Then they started asking where my papers were from Mexico giving me permission to manufacturer the MMS and saying that it was criminal to not have such papers. They took me to a school dedication ceremony\t conducted\t by\t the\t first\t lady\t and\t on\t the\t way\t back\t from\t the\t ceremony they really began to work me over. They talked about the crime of having a liquid without a paper showing permission from my government to manufacture the liquid and how I needed to give the officials\t in\t the\t health\t department\t a\t few\t bucks\t to\t get\t them\t to\t agree\t to\t several weeks of testing which I must pay for."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"207     Mexico At that point I just agreed to everything that they said, and agreed to\t meet\t them\t the\t next\t day.\t It\t was\t finally\t dawning\t on\t me.\t They\t let\t me off at my hotel telling me they would pick me up in the morning. As soon as they left, I found the one man I had made friends with who could speak a little English. I told him I wanted to go to the US consulate. He agreed to help me. He got a taxi from off the street and rode with me to the consulate. I took my luggage and computer with me. I paid him enough money to buy a bicycle, as I had a pocket full of money but nowhere to exchange it. He wrote me an email a year later saying that he had bought a bicycle with my money. I was extremely happy to get any help at all as it seemed everyone was working against me. At the American Consulate I explained the situation. The lady at the consulate said it looked like they were about to have me arrested if\t I\t didn’t\t cough\t up\t some\t money\t to\t the\t various\t health\t officials\t and\t others. Then if I were in jail, they would be my only friends helping me to get out and that will be really expensive. A Pricey Ticket Out She said she could get me a ticket but that it would cost. It was a one-way ticket, but it cost as much as a two-way ticket and more, and it was to Los Angeles, and of course no two-way tickets were available. She couldn’t do anything about the cost of the ticket. People of that country know the situation: if you want to buy a one way ticket out, and you want to leave right away, they know that they can get several times the cost of a regular ticket. I left the country that evening at 12 midnight. I hid until the time to leave for the airport as I thought if they found out that I was leaving they would come looking for me. I went into a barber shop in a hotel where I was not staying and had a haircut and shave to spend some of the hours. Then I read a magazine in the corner of the barber shop that was not visible from the corridor. As the airplane cleared the airport I heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that they would not call it back for small potatoes like me. I felt that it was amazing that they didn’t care about the millions of\t dollars\t the\t UN\t could\t provide.\t The\t fact\t was\t that\t the\t UN\t officials\t did call their health minister and they didn’t care, and evidently the health minister didn’t care either.

Back in Mexico, But ... After I was back in Mexico for about a month, I began to get sicker and sicker. I used MMS and I used too much and that made me worse. I was taking 6 drops an hour and that was too much. Clara was\t worried\t and\t upset\t and\t finally\t relaxed\t a\t bit\t when\t I\t said\t I\t would\t go\t to\t the\t hospital.\t I\t knew\t something\t was\t wrong,\t and\t I\t needed\t to\t find\t out\twhat.\tI\twas\tcoughing\ta\tbit\tand\tmy\tbreathing\twas\ta\tlittle\tdifficult.

(Now why do suppose they knew to do that?)\t It\t showed\t that\t my\t lungs\t were\t filling\t with\t mucus\t and\t there\t was\t little room left for oxygen. They said I had pneumonia of unknown origin. They put me in a room and on a respirator and started me on their\t pills.\t I\t discovered\t later\t that\t I\t had\t the\t swine\tflu and they knew to be looking for it weeks before the epidemic happened. They knew it\t was\t swine\t flu\t or\t they\t wouldn’t\thave\t taken\t me\t straight\t to\t the\t X-ray\t room. Well, let me tell you about their pills. A lot of people don’t know this, as the medical people don’t much mention it much, but there is nothing the medical people can do against any virus. I mentioned this earlier. The only thing they can do is give you antibacterial pills to prevent any additional infection . And that is what they gave me, some\tantibacterial\tpills\tbut\tnothing\tfor\tthe\tflu\tvirus. Since I had previously overdosed myself, I immediately stopped taking MMS even though Clara was there to give it to me if I wanted it. After several hours, I was beginning to feel a little better. Then I had Clara begin giving me one drop an hour of activated MMS in juice. That did the job. Remember, I had been taking 6 drops an hour and that was too much. Clara, my secretary, put the MMS under my bed where I could reach it. She stayed with me all night and the next day, giving me doses of MMS hourly. The doctor was surprised how fast I recovered. On the morning of the third day, I went home and for a while I returned every two days for a chest X-ray.

The news was announcing less than 80 deaths, but my friends who worked at that hospital were telling me were more than 2000 deaths so far. Two doctors who started there using MMS in their private practice called from southern Mexico and said that more than 150 deaths had happened in their hospitals. Still the news said less than 80 deaths. So through special phone connections with people I knew and relatives of my Mexican partner, I was able to reach a senator in the Mexican Senate on his personal cell phone. He was considered very powerful in the senate at the time -- the second most powerful man in the senate. I had talked to him before and he was familiar with MMS. I said that I thought we could\thandle\tthe\tswine\tflu problem with MMS. He said, Jim, there are some very powerful people who have tied the hands of the senate and won’t allow us to move. My advice is that you should get out of Mexico now, because it could be very dangerous for you if you stay here. I said, “I’m going.” My baggage was already checked, and I was waiting to go when some people phoned and said that their small city nearby had many swine\t flu\t victims\t and\t they\t needed\t help.\t I\t cancelled\t my\t flight\t and\t called a doctor in town who said that he would be happy to go with me the next day to that town to help them.

The reason I chose South Africa was because a friend, Bruce Thompson, invited me to meet a doctor in Durbin, South Africa. We had agreed to meet in Cape Town because I didn’t want to leave a direct trail to me. Of course, our air tickets leave a direct trail that any agency or private detective can follow. But we left Cape Town traveling in a rented car with a driver. Anyone would\t have\t a\t hard\t time\t finding\t the\t route\t that\t we\t took\t out\t of\t Cape\t Town as we gave our driver false names. The car rental cost more than a couple of airplane tickets, but it makes it hard for someone to trace you. We, Bruce and I, arrived in Durbin about May 6, 2009, and Bruce called his doctor friend, Dr. Zondo, who is a Zulu medical doctor and also a close relative of the then recently elected president of South Africa (still president at this time, December 2010). New Hospital and 500 Students Well, Bruce didn’t know it, but Dr. Zondo was building a hospital on top of a mountain about 60 miles from Durbin. He had many plans and lots of money from the government. He also planned to put small herbal clinics throughout the jungle in the northern part of South Africa and in several of the neighboring countries. He was going to convert steel shipping containers into small clinic buildings. The shipping containers are just about the size of your single car garage. They would do OK as a clinic in the jungle. There would be room for sales of herbs and a diagnosis and treatment room. It would be almost impossible to fail, as thousands need treatment in these areas, and believe it or not, they have money. They don’t have a lot of money, but enough to pay small amounts for treatment."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"212 South Africa When I told Dr. Zondo about MMS, he immediately wanted to include it in his hospital on the mountain as well as in the jungle clinics and that would guarantee the success of everything, provided Zondo could get everything coordinated. Somehow Dr. Zondo had gotten together 500 students to learn “traditional medicine.” What is traditional medicine? Well, it’s the Zulu traditions for use of jungle herbs. It is many times better than western USA medicine except in the area of surgery – but that is generally not needed anyway. The Zulus fought the British and in 1879, they won a very large battle and were never conquered by the British.\t The\t present\t president\t of\t South\t Africa\t is\t the\t first\t Zulu\t to\t hold\t that\t office,\t and\t the\t Zulu\t nation\t is\t one\t of\t considerable\t influence\t in\t South Africa today. Bruce and I were invited to talk to the 500 students. I talked to them about MMS and how they might use it in their clinics or the hospital and Bruce had some high tech soap that he was trying to get people in Africa interested in. He talked to the students about the soap. It was pretty good soap and it helped overcome diseases and had a hundred uses, but in a number of trips to Africa he had never sold enough to cover his expenses. He showed them the soap and treated a number of headaches and other pains and his soap really seemed to work. The headaches and pains went away, but no one had any money to buy. There were some cities quite a distance away and he wanted to visit them\tso\the\tborrowed\t$1000\tfrom\tme\tand\tflew\taway.\t MMS Treatments For All The students all wanted to try MMS so I had them set up some foam cups and the next day 6 students and I treated all 500 students to a 6-drop dose of MMS. I warned everyone that some would have some nausea because out of 500 people there are always 4 or 5 who have nausea. Unfortunately the students helping me started getting careless about the 6 drops of MMS and we calculated later that a few students got as many as 18 drops. So more than 5 or 6 people were quite nauseous. But many of the complaints that people had were healed that day, such as mouth sores, pains in the legs, joints and stomach, diarrhea, and\t other\t things.\t I\tforget\t specifically\t what\t was\t said\t but\t many\t testified\t that their problems were gone."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"213 South Africa The Classes That Never Were On about the 4th day I was there, Zondo moved the bunch up to the mountain top where his hospital was being built. I was supposed to begin teaching MMS classes to a group of 50 students that he picked out. He was supposed to pick me up at 7 am and take me to the mountain top. Well, I was staying in town at a cheap motel and the mountain was 60 miles out of Durban. I waited for Zondo to arrive. Eight o’clock came, then 9, then 10, 11, and 12. He arrived at about 4:30. He took me to the mountain top, but it was an hour-and-a-half drive. By the time we arrived, the students were settling down for the night and there was no time to get the group together. That happened every day. I never arrived in time to do an MMS class. Meanwhile Zondo’s office\t on\t the\t mountain was converted into a clinic. The 500 students were being treated with MMS for many things and almost all of them were standing in line to have their faces sprayed. Most of them really needed it as there were many kinds of obscure infection"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"214 South Africa that really needed treating. However, I was running out of MMS. If that happened, the really bad cases would not be treated. So I asked\t them\t to\t quit\t treating\t faces\t until\t I\t could\t find\t some\t local\t sodium\t chlorite to make more MMS. I\t finally\trealized\t that\t Zondo\t was\t never\t going\t to\t pick\t me\t up\t in\t time\t to\t teach classes on MMS. I suggested that I move up to the mountain top with all the students. Zondo liked the idea, so he said he would come get me the next day. The next day he phoned me and said that he would send someone to pick me up, so very late that day I arrived at the mountain top. However, Zondo said, “You can’t stay here. It’s not good enough. You must stay at my place.” Moving Into the Zulu Complex He took me down the mountain. Right at the foot of the mountain he had a complex of the Zulu round houses. I call it a complex for want of the real name. There are set rules on how these Zulu complexes are\t built.\t The\t first\t wife\t lives\t in\t the\t first\t building\t (round\t building)\t to\t the\t left in the complex. He had 4 wives. The second wife, of course, lives in the second building, but I don’t remember all the rules.

These houses have no partitions. They are just a big round building with beds, TVs, couches, chairs, and other electronic items and clothes. The food is prepared and served in another house. Bathing is done outdoors, normally in a bucket of water. The weather is usually warm so this is possible most of the year. The toilet is an outhouse."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"215 South Africa Good Ideas But Poor Management The problem was that even when I was staying at the foot of the mountain, I still wasn’t getting to the students in time to give them lessons. Dr. Zondo had good ideas and really wanted to do a great thing, but he knew nothing about management or how to plan. He was running around doing little jobs while most everyone else was standing\t around\t trying\t to\t figure\t out\t what\t they\t should\t do.\t He\t would\t form a plan for the next day, promising to pick me up at 7 am. Then he would tell a dozen other people what he would do, and the next day nothing got done. It wasn’t long before he just began to ignore me. I took him aside and said we needed to talk. I had a management lecture for him. I\t pointed\t out\t that\t one\t person\t can’t\t efficiently\t manage\t more\t than\t 5\t or 6 people. And those people can each manage 5 or 6 each, and so on. I pointed out that he was running around trying to manage 500 students, and a couple of dozen different workers, and it was impossible. I suggested that he pick out some of the best students and put them in charge of things, and appoint a foreman to supervise the workers. He immediately agreed with me and said he would begin to do that tomorrow. A Fatal Accident Well, the next day I was at his house waiting for him as usual. I wait and wait and wait. Finally I get a phone call. Something terrible has happened and he will see me in the morning. The next morning, he\t doesn’t\t show\t up\t of\t course,\t but\t finally\t arrives\t at\t about\t 1\t PM.\t He\t explains\t that\t one\t of\t the\t hospital’s\t unfinished\t walls\t fell\t down\t and\t killed two students. He was up to his neck in police, investigators, parents, Zulu chiefs, and relatives. He never got to the delegating authority bit. I stayed there waiting until things settled down, hoping I would be able to teach the classes on MMS, but that never happened. There was always something else needing to be done. Zondo took me to the wall that fell down and explained how the cement blocks were not exactly laid in right and that made the wall weak so that a puff of wind could blow it down. I said OK, but after he was gone, I poked around for a while."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"216 South Africa What actually happened was that his men were using the wrong mixture of cement with the wrong mixture of water. So later that day, I called him over and said, “I just want to show you what really went wrong with your wall.” I pointed out numerous places where the cement was not adhering to the blocks. The cement was there, but with no connection to the blocks. There was nothing holding the cement blocks in place but gravity, and when the wind hit, they fell down. Zondo could take a hint, so he got a cement expert from somewhere and they got the cement mixture correct as they put the wall back up and the other walls of the complex. An Audience With the President? Finally, Zondo came to me and said: “I want you to come with me to Joburg. We are going to have an audience with my relative the President. I want you to speak to him.” I\t really\t didn’t\twant\t to\t fly\t to\t Johannesburg,\t as\t that\t would\t again\t make\t it easy for people to locate me. My ticket would be on the internet and\t with\t the\t proper\t search\t criteria,\t someone\t could\t find\t it\t in\t less\t than\t 5 minutes. But meeting the president and talking to him about MMS seemed important enough for me to let it go and take the chance. Probably no one would be looking for me until much later anyway. So I agreed to go. Later I found out that Zondo was taking 6 other people to Joburg. As the weeks had passed, Zondo had ignored me more and more. I didn’t really understand the reason and still don’t. It was probably"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"217 South Africa because I am a white man. We met at a hotel in town and the whole bunch pretty much ignored me. They sat around talking in Zulu and I didn’t know what was going on. Finally one said, “We are going to the car now.” At the airport, everyone sat around talking in Zulu, and finally\tZondo\thanded\tme\ta\tticket.\t On the airplane it was the same. When we arrived in Johannes - burg, they said, “Come on and get in the car.” They never mentioned where we were going. We went to a very well-built but cheap hotel. I was ignored until noon the next day and then one of them knocked on my door and said, “Come on and get in the car.” He didn’t mention where we were going. We went to a fast food place, and after lunch it was “Get in the car” again and we went to talk to some businessmen. Zondo wanted me to sell MMS to the businessmen, and I did that and everyone was happy. I thought they were going to produce MMS for the project, but I wasn’t sure. The next day, they took me to lunch the same way. It wasn’t, “Hey, we are going to lunch now.” Nope, it was, “Get in the car.” Then in the afternoon it was again, “Get in the car.” I asked where we were going. The answer was, “The airport.” It wasn’t mentioned that we were going home. I didn’t meet the president, but evidently they did because Zondo told me the next day that the president ordered 2000 bottles for the armed services. He never mentioned the incident again. Never said why I didn’t meet the president or anything else. I had been trying for weeks to have him buy a barrel of sodium chlorite (MMS powder), but he seemed to miss the point every day. That was it for me. I told him the next day after we returned from Joburg that I was moving back to town. I said, “I am going to hold classes in town. If you or any of your students want to come and learn,\t that\t is\t fine,\t but\t my\t classes\t will\t start\t in\t the\t morning\t at\t 8\t am\t and\t anyone not there won’t get to come in late.” A Dependable New Student One woman had been calling me about MMS after she heard about it from one of the students. She was a woman who travels around the world doing prayers for people, but she likes to see people get well and have better health."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"218 South Africa She began bugging me to come and stay with her family, so that is where I went. By that time I had found a man who would taxi me around the town for a reasonable price and he picked me up from Zondo’s round house. I began teaching the woman and her family about MMS and she began treating people. Her name, by the way in case someone would like to help, is Maliga Naidoo , in Durbin, South Africa, and her phone number is 076 73 141. I found a chemical company in town, bought a barrel of sodium chlorite and took it to her house. I bought the equipment to make MMS, which isn’t a lot. I taught her husband how to measure out the chemicals and water to get the right mixture. She began treating people in her home and I bought 50 chairs for her garage for the lessons I would be teaching on MMS. Dr. Zondo came down from the mountain and learned how to make MMS. I doubt that he will get those 2000 bottles done in less than a year, if ever. I never taught any classes, but the woman’s husband came to know MMS pretty well. I was anxious to get out of there. I was a little worried that the airplane trip\t had\t allowed\t anyone\t who\t wanted\t to\t find\t me\t to\t at\t least\t know\t the\t city where to look. But that wasn’t the main problem; I had people in another African country with thousands of people who needed to be treated right away. I wanted to go where I was really needed and could rack up a lot of successful\t cases\t to\t finally\t show\t to\t a\t magazine\t or\t a\t newspaper,\t in\t hopes that the world would begin to know about MMS. This new place had hospitals and clinics where the blood tests could be done and records could be kept and where as much as 60% of the population needed treatment. How could I ignore that? Where I was, we were treating two or three people a day and the woman and her family could take care of that easily. Also, there was nowhere to do before-and-after blood tests.

I could take a hired car from there. But I"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"219 South Africa didn’t do that, I took a bus. I was sorry I did. I never go places as a “looky loo.” I’ve seen plenty of countryside. I want to do things when I go somewhere, not just look. I was lucky I was not a looker as the bus was loaded to the gills. There were so many passengers that I couldn’t see out, as someone was always blocking the view. The\t aisles\t were\t filled\t with\t luggage\t and\t someone\t was\t sitting\t on\t each suitcase. Those who passed up and down the aisle stepped on suitcases and over the people. I was lucky to get a seat. A couple of young ladies invited me to sit in the seat beside them before someone else took it. I was extremely grateful as there were no more seats. We were so crowded that one lady found it necessary to sit on my shoulder as people passed by. Without that seat, I would have had to sit on someone’s suitcase in the aisle for 36 hours. I was the only white guy on the bus. Thousands of people from other continents travel in Africa but very few use the buses. Everywhere I went on main roads and back roads, there were always people from other continents, generally in some sort of powerful 4-wheel drive vehicle, but many in plain passenger cars. I’d say in any one day we would see from 10 to 20 such travelers. Some are concerned with Africa, but most just come to look. There is nothing wrong with that, if they want to do it. It’s just not my cup of tea. The date that I left South Africa was June 10, 2009. I am really interested in Dr. Zondo’s program of putting clinics throughout the jungle. It’s a good idea, and I doubt that anyone can stop him legally as he has the President on his side. I’m thinking that he needs some help. I might phone him and offer to do a single clinic with one of his steel cargo containers. I would make sure that he understood that I would do the clinic myself without his help, as his help never happens anyway. Then\t I\t would\t finance\t the\t single\t clinic\t beyond\t what\t he\t would\t give.\t We would have to deliver the container and put it in place and get all the supplies and various MMS bottles. It would be a project, but can you imagine what hundreds of these clinics in the jungle would do? They would destroy the credibility of the drug companies and the South African government would protect them because of the President’s relative. Of course, putting just one clinic in the jungle wouldn’t be hundreds, but it would cut a path for the other clinics.

I arrived at the bus station and took a taxi to the local hotel where my friend Zahir Shaikh had already reserved a room for me. I did consider Zahir one of my best friends on Earth, but I understand his problem: he is always so busy getting things done, that he doesn’t have time to get other things done, and one other thing would have been to meet me at the bus depot. The bus depot is in another city about 4 hours away from where his business is located. He did have time to make a reservation at a top class hotel (about 200 US Dollars a night) and to pay the bill for me, which was nice. In the morning I took a taxi to a bus station. I told the driver to take me to\t a\t first\t class\t bus\t station\t as\t I\t didn’t\t want\t any\t more\t crowded\t buses.\t And in fact I did get a bus that was not crowded and I was able to watch the scenery as we traveled about 4 hours to my friend’s city called Lilongwe. Since, at the border, I was able to get my telephone Sim card switched over to the Malawi phone system, I was able to talk to Zahir\t and\t he\t was\t trying\t desperately\t to\t find\t someone\t to\t meet\t me\t at\t the bus station where I was headed. Something had come up and he couldn’t meet me there either. I said, “Quit worrying, I will simply take a taxi to your place. What could be any easier?” So that’s what I did. When I arrived, I sat back to wait for Zahir. Working With Zahir If Omar Sharif, the movie actor, has a double in this world, it is Zahir Shaikh, my friend. Of course, I have never seen the two of them together, but they are spitting images as the saying goes. He showed up in about twenty minutes and pumped my hand for minutes. We were happy to meet again. We had talked by email for years about finding\t a\t gold\t mine.\t There\t are\t no\t gold\t mines\t close\t by\t in\t Malawi,\t but\t there are records of those who found gold in the last century and before. And now we discussed gold mines for a while and agreed to go out looking for them very soon. I thought maybe I could take a few weeks off and enjoy the jungles. So I stayed at Zahir’s place in his guest room. He has about an acre of land with a beautiful brick fence all the way around. Houses and"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"222 HIV / AIDS in Malawi fences and buildings are all made out of brick in Africa and Malawi is no exception. Wood is too expensive, but most of the ground can be baked into bricks with a little bit of work, and if you can afford cement to mix into the brick clay, you don’t need to bake them. The cement hardens them. Zahir’s bricks were of the cement-hardened variety. Zahir is a humanitarian and I suspect that all the talk about gold was only a ruse to get me back to Malawi. I wanted to take my time, get some MMS chemicals delivered to us in Malawi, get some MMS bottles made up, go check for some gold, and have everything ready by the time I tried to begin treating people. But Zahir didn’t have that in mind. On the second day, he said to me, “I want you to meet Father Gamba. Let’s take a ride down to see him tomorrow. Better bring your suitcases with you as he might want you to stay there for a while.” I couldn’t say no. It wouldn’t be polite. So I met Father Gamba and he said, “You can stay in room 10 and dinner is served in the mess hall at 7 pm.” I surmised that Father Gamba and Zahir had already come to an agreement about me, and I was in no position to say no. Father Gamba said, “I’ll have a man take you out to the Herbal Clinic and several hospitals tomorrow and you can tell them and show them what you have.” So between Father Gamba and Zahir’s agreements, I was evidently going to stay there. Of course I had to do it. How could I not? With this thing I am doing, one has to grab the opportunities when they arise.\t But\t I\t got\t the\t definite\t feeling\t that\t Zahir\t didn’t\t want\t me\t to\t stay\t at his house. The First Malaria Case So Zahir left me at a Catholic complex. There were many buildings and some of the area was blocked off where there were several antelopes in the yard. Of course, the people in the area are quite poor. Father Gamba is in charge of the whole complex and thus as long as I had his blessing, so to speak, I could get MMS introduced there. The\t first\t night\t at\t the\t Catholic\t complex,\t I\ttreated\t a\t woman\t for\t malaria.\t Zahir thought it was a mistake to just pick a woman out and treat her, but it happened that as Father Gamba was showing me my room, this woman was going to her room. I could see she was sick. Father Gamba introduced us and I asked how she was feeling. She said, “Not so good”, and she mentioned that the malaria drug wasn’t really"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"223 HIV / AIDS in Malawi helping a lot. I said, “Well I’ve brought some new stuff for malaria; it should help you very quickly. Would you like to try it?” She seemed somewhat dubious, but after all, I was with Father Gamba and he was not objecting, so she said, “Why not.” I mixed her up the dose that I had come to trust for malaria: •\t 15 drops of MMS activated with a lemon that we had. We added some juice and she drank it. I asked her to come back in an hour and I would give her another dose. I did give her another 15-drop dose, and she felt better for a little while but the next day, she was feeling bad again. I wanted her to start taking 6-drop doses, but she didn’t want anything to do with it and she started back on the malaria drugs as recommended by her doctor. And within a few hours she was feeling OK. The real story that woman will never know unless she reads this book. The facts are that if two 15-drop doses of MMS didn’t totally kill the malaria in her body, then she was extremely loaded with malaria parasites. •\t Normally\t the\t first\t 15-drop\t dose\t kills\t most\t any\t malaria\t I\t have\t ever seen: •\t The second 15-drop dose is just to make sure that it is all gone. Anyone\t should\t be\t OK\t from\t the\t first\t 15-drop\t dose.\t But\t she\t had\t two\t 15-drop doses and was still sick. MMS kills malaria in 4 hours. I have only seen a couple of other people who were as sick as that lady. One dropped dead, and the other barely made it. The one that made it had less than two 15-drop doses. In other words, he was severely ill, but it still didn’t take two 15-drop doses to heal him. I would say that this woman was very close to not making it and that if she had not had those two doses of MMS, she would either have been sick for weeks trying to make the malaria drug work or she would have died. As it was, the two doses brought her back to being just normally sick with malaria, and then the regular malaria drugs were able to work. Well, that’s my estimation after having treated more than a thousand cases."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"224 HIV / AIDS in Malawi Treating HIV/AIDS My problem in this place was I had a small supply of MMS and the chemicals were not available to make more. I could not introduce MMS to all of the hospitals as I would have liked to do, because there wasn’t enough MMS to go around. I couldn’t tell people about it and then say, “I don’t have any now, but I will soon.” That really doesn’t work. I had Zahir to blame that on and I was a little irritated with him. But I did go to one place and talk to the doctor there. I had someone with me to help translate into the local language. Because I was from Father Gamba, the doctor there became very interested in MMS. The clinic was owned by the Catholic complex and the doctor was paid by the Catholics. He was a herb doctor and used only herbs and no drugs. He wanted me to come the next day and help him with it. The next day I came with a couple of bottles of MMS. I had noticed some lemons there so I wasn’t too worried about how to activate it. We treated some of the patients and the next day they were well. The doctor’s name at that clinic was Dr. Kalioti. We became friends. After several days of treating different people and seeing them get well in a day or so, Dr. Kalioti took me aside and said, “What about HIV? will it help HIV patients? He wanted to jump right into it. Of course told him I thought it would help. He said, ”All of my staff here, 5 people, are positive for HIV.” As it turned out in the next day or two, they all wanted to try it. One girl had a cancer under her arm that was getting slowly worse, and they all had various problems that come with HIV – what are called opportunistic diseases. So they all started on MMS. As you probably know, the HIV protocol is called MMS Protocol 1000"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"225 HIV / AIDS in Malawi and it involves taking MMS every hour. Soon, everyone there was diligently at it. •\t It is a three week program with the person taking 3 drops an hour, 8 hours a day for three weeks. Within\t the\t first\t week\t they\t had\t all\t lost\t their\t various \thealth\t complaints.\t The girl with the cancer under her arm had already noticed that the pain was gone and the lump was beginning to shrink. I didn’t say it was cancer and she didn’t either; it was her doctor who said it. It was definitely\t getting\t smaller. Dr. Kalioti began telling people who came that they could have the HIV protocol and many began to accept it. I learned that 60% of the people in this area are positive for HIV. Teaching the Patients to Self-Administer MMS Each day, a few more people started on the HIV protocol. After I treated\t the\t first\t few,\t the\t doctor\t took\t over.\t Every\t patient\t must\t be\t trained to do the protocol, because I found long ago that if you don’t train them, they go home and do it wrong. We had every person who wanted to do the protocol bring a small bottle from home. Most people brought a plastic bottle that once had hand lotion in it, and I am sure that most of them cleaned the hand lotion out before coming to the clinic. I started using my knife to make a slot in the bottle tops so that they could get one drop out at a time. We then had the patients mix their own doses: Step #1: They dripped three drops of MMS into the glass, out of"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"226 HIV / AIDS in Malawi the slot on top of the bottle; Step #2: They then squeezed 15 drops of lemon into the same glass and waited 3 minutes; Step #3: While waiting, they squeezed the rest of the lemon into another glass and added a spoonful of sugar and half a glass of water; Step #4: After making sure that three minutes were up, they poured one glass into the other to make their MMS drink. Basically, they were using lemon juice to drink it down. There is practically no other juice in this country that you can buy. They have an orange concentrate and a pineapple concentrate and that is it. So it\t was\t necessary\t to\t teach\t them\t to\t use\t lemonade \tto\t dilute\t and\t flavor\t the MMS. Every single person who came to start the HIV protocol made at least one MMS dose starting with the three drops out of the bottle. People must do each step themselves so that they know exactly how to do it when they get home. Dr. Kalioti understood the need for that right away. We had to use bottles with a slit in the top to make drops. It would have been nice to have a bottle that was already designed for drops, but you will remember, I had no time allotted for obtaining appropriate supplies. The Closed-Minded Study Group At\t the\t Catholic\t hotel\t that\t I\t moved\t to\t after\t the\t first\t week,\t there\t was\t a group of 12 people who had come to study the effects that HIV has on families. They had applied for permission to visit families and question them about the effects of HIV. However the local authority had turned them down. So each day they were sitting in the dining room somehow studying the effects of HIV on the family. (How do you suppose they were studying the Malawi families sitting in the dining room?) At\t first\t I\t didn’t\t know\t what\t they\t were\t doing,\t but\t finally\t one\t of\t them,\t the leader, came over and introduced herself. She asked me what I was doing there. I explained I was working with the Herbal Clinic down the road about a mile. She asked, “Well what do you do?” I explained that the people there and others coming in were losing their opportunistic diseases (diseases that develop as a result of HIV destroying the immune system) and that in Mexico, my patients had"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"227 HIV / AIDS in Malawi tested negative for HIV, and I expected the same thing for the patients here. She just stuck her nose up and said, “Don’t be ridiculous; that’s impossible,” and walked away. No Interest in HIV Recoveries Well, for the next week or so, I noticed that no-one was talking to me. At breakfast no-one said anything. The only time anyone would say hello was if I stood directly in their path and they couldn’t pretend not to see me. Finally the same woman approached me again and said, “You know that there isn’t anything that cures HIV.” I said, “My solution is different.” She said, “Well I don’t see how it is possible.” So I pointed out that I would be glad to explain the technology of my solution. She indicated she might be willing to listen. She asked how long it would take. I said, “Not long, probably half an hour or so.” She said, “No thanks,” and walked off. That was the last thing that woman ever said to me other than hello as we passed in the front room, dining room, or parking lot. The rest of the group seldom spoke either; they preferred to ignore me. Down the road from them about one mile, we were making history. At that time, we had not yet developed a way of proving that those who completed the HIV protocol were HIV negative. Only a few, at that time about 5, went for testing and actually came out HIV negative. The others didn’t go for a check so we had no proof either way, except that all were very healthy and feeling happy that their pains were gone. All the opportunistic diseases were gone and what I noticed was very robust activity. It was better than the other people who were HIV negative all along. They all put on their reports “Happy.” So the group of people studying HIV and the terrible effects on the family were not even interested in going down the road one mile to see history being made -- to see that those terrible effects they were studying didn’t need to be. This closed-minded group represented America to most of the people there. Study Group Members Competing For Local Support The Matron who runs the Catholic hotel was taking MMS and they found out. The leader tried to get her to go to the hospital and be checked. The Matron told her to tend to her own business. The group"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"228 HIV / AIDS in Malawi was extra irritated with me because various important people from the area were visiting me and several even came to be treated. That really upset them and they went into a huff whenever they passed me in the corridors. There were so many people supporting me that for the present time, I didn’t have to go to the government for permission. Chances are always about 99% that if I go to a government, they will put a stop to it or won’t let me get started. The fact that people were helping me made the study group even more upset, as they were convinced that I was fooling the locals, and they were extra mad because they couldn’t get the locals to help them. As far as I am concerned, this study group exactly represented millions of people in America -- maybe not 50% of America anymore, but at least 40%. For more than 100 years, up to 90% of Americans diagnosed with cancer have been running right to their oncologists and winding up with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Those are three things that will kill you faster than doing nothing, and with a great deal more pain. Millions died that way. Well, that was their choice. Finally, one of the group came to me and said, “Aren’t you worried that\t when\t the\t government\t finds\t out,\t they\t will\t put\t you\t in\t prison?\t You\t are going to need a good lawyer.” I answered, “Yes, and not only here, but in 5 or 6 other countries as well.” That did it. None of them had any idea what to make of that answer, but from their attitude I assumed it didn’t please them. A Great Success Story I have to tell you about one young lady who phoned and asked permission to come see me. When she knocked on the door, I was appalled at her condition. She had sores from head to toe, even on her face and in her hair, inside her mouth, and even down her throat. They all had to be painful. She said that she had been traveling for over 36 hours to get here. She had heard of me from a friend. It wasn’t easy for her. She traveled on the little mini buses because they are cheapest. It’s poor traveling, as they stop frequently. When she arrived at about three in the morning, she slept at the bus terminal before calling me. I don’t know if she had something to eat or not. But I never refuse anyone, no matter how ill they are. I dug a small bottle out of one of my suitcases, emptied the face cream out, and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"229 HIV / AIDS in Malawi washed\t it\t out\t in\t the\t bathroom.\t Then\t I\t filled\t it\t with\t MMS.\t I\t put\t a\t hole\t in the lid and had her practice getting drops of water out of it. Then I had her make herself a dose of MMS: Step #1: She put 3 drops of MMS in a glass; Step #2: I sliced a lemon in half and squeezed 15 drops on top of the 3 MMS drops; Step #3: I had her swish the glass for a few seconds and wait 3 minutes; Step #4: In another glass, I had her squeeze the rest of the lemon\t and\t half\t fill\t the\t glass\t with\t water,\t add\t a\t heaping\t teaspoon\t of sugar, and stir it. Step #5: She then poured it into the other glass with the MMS activated by 15 drops of lemon juice and drank the mixture. As before, the reason I had her use fresh lemon juice was because there is no fruit juice in this country, none at all. Then I told her that she had to do that same thing every hour for 8 hours a day for three weeks. I also gave another bottle of MMS to make up solutions to spray on her skin. Of course, I didn’t charge her because I charge no one. That keeps me out of trouble in Africa. She went back outside and got on a bicycle taxi which took her back to the bus station. About three weeks later, I was still at the Catholic Hotel and there came a knock on my door. I opened it and there stood a woman about 30 years old. She was one of the most beautiful African women that I have ever seen, and one of the things that helped her look so good was the radiant look on her face. When she came through the door she was smiling wide with a beautiful smile she just couldn’t stop. I am sure you know that it was the same woman who previously had all the sores. Her skin was smooth and perfect and soft. She asked me to feel it. She had again traveled all day and all night and again slept at the bus station. She had come for no other reason than to show me how well she had done and to thank me. We talked for a while. I couldn’t understand her language, nor she mine, but we communicated OK. I gave her another bottle of MMS because she said she had a friend who needed it. She left the same way, on a bicycle taxi back to the bus station."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"230 HIV / AIDS in Malawi Adding MMS 2 One man who was in charge at the clinic heard about me within the first\t few\t days.\t He\t called\tme\t several\t times\t and\t then\t came\t to\t see\t me.\t I\t was\t a\t little\t worried\t at\t first,\t but\t all\t he\t wanted\t to\t do\t was\t help.\t I\t eventually went to live at his house. He charged me rent but it was much cheaper than paying for a hotel room in the Catholic complex. The most notable thing was that the food at his house was dozens of times better than the food at the complex. For the record, his name is Namanja. When\t I\t was\t first\t in\t this\t area,\t it\t cost\t me\t thousands\t of\t dollars\t to\t get around, as I had to hire taxis to go everywhere. Taxis are as expensive here as in the US. There were times when I just had to go to town as I really needed to use the internet. A single trip was $200. Really short trips were $15 and I usually made several of those each day. Finally, after spending a thousand in one month, I bought a bicycle. It cost $100 and I had one of the carpenter shops make a wooden box and mount it on the back. The box was big enough for most of the things I carried and if something was too big, I tied it on top of the box. The bicycle saved me several thousand dollars at least, over a number of months, and my strength increased dramatical- ly. People in Malawi are all very friendly. They always say hello and wave and no one seemed to think that an old white man riding a bicycle around town was unusual. Many people heard that I was there to help them and everyone treated me extremely well. While there, I decided to introduce MMS2 to the internet world and"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"231 HIV / AIDS in Malawi here as well. As luck would have it, calcium hypochlorite is used to purify the water in swimming pools all over the world, and this country is no exception.

I was lucky\t to\t find\t someone\t who\t could\t get\t gel\t capsules\t and\t Dr.\t Kalioti began making thousands of MMS2 capsules. I told him that they would do most of the same things that MMS1 does and he began treating many people with MMS2. The ones he treated for HIV seemed to get over their health problems and were all OK. As long as people were willing to follow the protocol, we didn’t seem to have any failures. Lots of Willing Patients It is totally different in Malawi than the US or Mexico, where people are\t paid\t to\t have\t HIV.\t In\t those\t countries,\t we\t couldn’t\t find\t people\t who wanted to get well, but in Malawi everyone wanted to get well. Nobody who started the protocol abandoned it. People came from all over. We didn’t have to look for patients like in the U.S., as they were all showing up here at the clinic. A few people showed up who had cancer. I added MMS2 to their protocol and all of them came back a few times with their cancer much better. Of course I had already been taking MMS2 for 4 years and I had already given it to hundreds of people, so when I explained this to Dr. Kalioti , he wanted to use it himself, and he did. He kept saying to me, “These medicines are great.” And he told many others the same thing. He was having a lot of fun treating people and actually seeing them get well. That is a really great thing, to see people get well.

I wanted you to see it as I wrote it with the actual dates. You will see 3 totals for the number of HIV patients we successfully treated in Malawi (200, 500, and 800). We actually did treat 800 people before I left Malawi. As I had hoped, people from around the country began to hear that the Herbal Clinic was overcoming the diseases caused by HIV/AIDS, and more and more began to show up. Soon we were treating about 10 people a day for HIV/AIDS. I hired an assistant to keep records on each person. When possible, we noted each person’s CD4 count"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"232 HIV / AIDS in Malawi and\t where\t they\t were\t last\t officially\t tested\t for\t HIV.\t As\t of\t this\t writing\t we have had over 800 HIV/AIDS patients on the MMS protocol. The ones\t who\t have\t finished\t are\t all\t very\t happy,\t as\t all\t of\t their\t opportunis - tic diseases are gone and they are feeling well and strong. Most of them have checked with their doctors to prove that the diseases are gone. Finally, Father Gamba got cold feet and said that we had to make up a report on what we are doing and submit it to the local Health Authority. We did that and Namanja, whose house I was staying at, described our project as just one of many at the Herbal Clinic, which indeed it was. Father Gamba signed the report and it was sent to the local Health Authority and that seemed to work out as we had hoped. They didn’t respond and I assume that they won’t. It probably just passed across their desk and they took note and that was it. I am sure that Father Gamba had no intention of signing that report, but it was so well written and presented our work as another research project at the Herbal Clinic, and Namanja put it in front of him in such a manner that he just couldn’t refuse. So at this time, November 23, 2009, more than 200 of our patients have\t finished\t the\t MMS\t protocol\t and\t all\t have\t overcome\t their\t health\t problems and all are feeling good. We have complete records on each person. The problem is, there is no such thing at this time as a medical test that can prove HIV negative. All HIV tests check for antibodies or antigens . These will always be positive as the immune system continues to generate antibodies and antigens even when the HIV virus is no longer present. So even though there is no test for HIV negative, we know that it has been proven in a lab that chlorine dioxide does kill viruses in the blood. And the CD4 counts went up to normal on those patients who had them done. It is obvious to me that our patients are HIV negative. I have mentioned elsewhere in this book that no-one has ever been shown to have an HIV virus, but there are dozens of other viruses that show up in the blood and the tests don’t differentiate in what virus the viral load is. I\t am\t going\t for\t a\t count\t of\t 500\t people\t finishing\t the\t HIV\t protocol\t and\t all\t of\t them\t will\t be\t the\t same\t as\t our\t first\t 200,\t well\t and\t feeling\t good.\t Hopefully we will have come up with a way of proving that they are HIV negative by then, or at least we will have CD4 tests for them, all proving their white blood count is above normal."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"233 HIV / AIDS in Malawi The plan is that we will expand the operation to a wider area as soon as we have 500 people completed. We will need more money at that time. Should you feel a desire to help, this would be one way -- go to www.jimhumblefoundation.org and donate a few dollars. We would be very grateful.

And the fact is, so far there have been no failures when we make sure that the people follow the protocols given in this book, especially Protocols 1000 and 2000 . However there was a little trouble I might also mention here so you understand some of the problems facing us. Trouble With Local Police As time passed, various reports reached me that the woman whom I\t had\t treated\t for\t malaria\t when\t I\t first\t arrived,\t who\t continued\t with\t her\t malaria drug, was repeatedly trying to convince Father Gamba that he must not allow us to continue treating people in the Herbal Clinic as that would eventually get him into trouble. She insisted that the Herbal Clinic was for herbs, not for MMS. She was actually Father Gamba’s niece and she had quite a bit of sway\t over\t him.\t She\t finally\t convinced\t him\t and\t he\t called\t me\t in\t to\t give\t me the news: I must vacate the premises of the Herbal Clinic even though I was treating 15 to 20 people a day. I agreed to go in two weeks. By then it was January of 2010 and we\t were\t just\t finishing\t our\t 800\t HIV\t cases.\t As\t I\t have\t already\t stated,\t these 800 people were very happy to have been healed of opportu - nistic diseases and most of them felt that they were healed of HIV . They didn’t all believe it, as some had doctors who were telling them that they would die if they stopped taking ARV drugs. But they were all happy with their MMS results. Anyway, we moved to a little shop over town about two miles from the Herbal Clinic \tand\t easy\t enough\t for\t people\t to\t find\t us.\t We\t opened\t up and continued treating people, but we didn’t get very far. The enforcement side of the Poisons and Drug Board arrived wanting to talk to me and I came out to see what they wanted.

They accused me, among other things, of running a clinic without a license. If I had still been at the Herbal Clinic, they couldn’t have accused me of that, but here in the new clinic they thought they could. It wouldn’t have stood up in their court, however, as I was not running the clinic. Dr. Kalioti was and his license was on the wall. The only thing they could prove legally was that I had lent some money to Dr. Kalioti that he had used to set up the clinic. They took me to jail in that town. It was a rather large police station that handled the whole area, not just the town. We had healed several police and they were very nice to me and didn’t make me stay in jail as the Poisons Board people had requested. I signed a paper saying I would return the next day. The major problem was that I was now intending to go to the Dominican\t Republic\t to\t hold\t my\t first\t seminar\t to\t teach\t the\t complete\t technology of MMS.

It took a while to get a court date and then the scare came in. When the judge looked at the papers of what had happened, I quickly learned that he didn’t listen to the accused. He merely looked at the accusation and the fact I had already pleaded Guilty on paper. He said to me, “Mr. Humble I am going to send you to prison for 5 years.” Well, of course it scared me. It’s an English speaking country and I quickly said, “Your honor you don’t know the whole story. We treated 800 people and didn’t charge any of them a dime. I do not run the Clinic, Doctor Kalioti runs it.” Well, evidently he believed me. He said, “You will have my decision after our break.

He only paid me part of the money back and has refused to pay back the rest. He promised to pay it back by funding the new clinic, but once I was gone, he quit funding it, so the clinic in Malawi died. That means many HIV cases could not be serviced.

I have seen thousands of people taking poisonous ARV drugs and dying. I have been in the health food movement for more than 50 years and I know what governments will do. There is little doubt that the pharmaceutical companies pay governmental\t officials\t when\t they\t need\t to,\t in\t Africa\t and\t throughout\t the world.

They go willingly to the chopping block, believing what the universities spout."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"238 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing In 1776, when the greatest nation on earth got its start, so did the Illuminati. The Illuminati’s stated goal, which was never really hidden, was and is to control all governments on Earth and to own all private property on Earth. To that end, they have continuously employed religions\t in\t one\t way\t or\t another.\t However,\t they\t were\t not\t the\t first\t to\t use religions. Since hundreds of centuries before the birth of Christ, evil men have worked their way into religions and used them for their own goals, to a greater extent sometimes and lesser extent other times. History doesn’t always tell the story, but you can usually see the results. For thousands of years, those in control of the religions saw to it that the laws, rituals, beliefs and even feelings of mankind were established universally so that religion could not be destroyed and could not be controlled by the governments. This has been established more deeply and more thoroughly than most people realize. Governments saw this, and seeing that they could not destroy these established rules, they instituted their own methods of controlling religions. These methods depend on fooling the religions into giving up their established powers and that is still true today. However, the Catholic Church, that is as powerful as any government on Earth, has not given up its powers. One\t of\t the\t firmly\t established\t rules\t of\t mankind\t is\t the\t separation\t of\t church and state. In one way or another, it is recognized by most courts of the world. The legal philosophy behind this concept is that of equal powers of Church and State. It is based on the concept that God is more powerful than the government. So for thousands of years, men with the same evil concepts as the Illuminati – basically, the desire to make us all slaves – have used religions against us and against governments. But as all aggressors at\t some\t point\t discover,\t the\t enemy\t eventually\t figures\t out\t your\t secret\t weapons, makes the weapons, and then uses them against you. For thousands\t of\t years,\t evil\t men\t have\t used\t religions \tand\t no\t one\t figured\t out what they were doing. But many people in this modern age of information\t have\t figured\t it\t out,\t and\t now\t know\t that\t their\t secret\t goal\t through the ages has been to control men by using religion. So when I suggested that we create a Church, but a non-religious non-denominational Church, there were many thousands of people who agreed with me. The idea was to use their weapon, religion, against them. They have set it so that we have power if we work"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"239 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing it right. They have developed it over the centuries and now it only takes knowledge and a little doing to gain this power. There were a few who disagreed, but amazingly enough, most of those who disagreed have changed their minds, even without me arguing the point. In studying the legality of it all, I found that we can create a church with the same church powers that the evil men took control of in the past. I found that that although most churches give up their powers when they are formed or shortly after they are formed, it is not necessary to give them up. It’s only because governmental agencies fool the churches into signing away their powers that they lose their rights. •\t For example, the IRS comes to a newly formed church and tells them that if they will sign a contract to be a 501(c)(3) non-profit\t corporation,\t the\t IRS\t will\t recognize\t them\t and\t they\t won’t have to pay taxes. But they didn’t have to pay taxes anyway, and once they sign that contract, they can’t say anything political from the pulpit. They can’t even suggest that children are owned by their parents rather than by the government, or a thousand other things. At this time, the governments of the USA, Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand, and a number of European countries have all attacked MMS. Funny thing – they are all using exactly the same lies and even the same wording made up by the U.S. FDA. Our timing with the church is just about right. We needed people to really see what the governments are going to do, yet not wait until it’s too late to act. Background of the Genesis II Church At a very early age, I realized that things were not right on this Earth and I knew somehow that some of us are here to do something about it. I knew I was just a country boy from Alabama and not a dramatic bubbling personality like movie stars. I also recognized that I was not a great leader of any kind. But I was sort of an inventor and\t I\t decided\t that\t I\t would\t have\t to\t use\t that\t as\t my\t tool\t to\t influence\t mankind. I worked for years on various inventions looking for something\tpotentially\tinfluential. •\t I invented a totally new technology of gold recovery that did not use chemicals of any kind so that there is no environ - mental impact from gold mining if one is careful. But the gold"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"240 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing mining industry, with hundreds of billions of dollars invested in the present chemical technology, was not interested. •\t My partner and I invented a technology for causing atomic radiation to drop to zero. But there were already billions invested in storing the radiation deep in the earth and that could not be changed –and anyway, all the learned professors knew that reducing radiation to zero is impossible. It has never ceased to amaze me that neither learned men nor ignorant critics can see past what they believe. •\t I invented a new helicopter, but that wasn’t dramatic enough so I gave that idea up. •\t I developed a new method of creating money in our society, developed a neighborhood club and actually created a quarter million dollars over a period of a year. It was totally legal and it might have worked for my purpose if I had had a million dollars of investment money at the time. There\t were\t quite\t a\t few\t other\t inventions\t that\t didn’t\t quite\t fit\t the\t bill.\t But I never lost faith that something would turn up to be a vehicle for beginning the job we have here. Finally in 1997, at the age of 65, I was prospecting in the jungle in South America -- a rainforest in Guyana, to be more precise. If\t you\t read\t my\t first\t book\t you\t know\t the\t story.\t I\t discovered\t how\t to\t heal malaria, the worst disease of mankind. It became immediately apparent to me that I must bring this chemical, this procedure, to mankind. I healed myself of malaria and headed for the US. Having studied the recent history of medicine, I also realized there would be no point in trying to introduce this discovery to medical science. I decided to go the only way I could go, grass roots. I never mentioned to the government or medical science that it existed, and that\t worked\t for\t over\t 10\t years.\t This\t solution,\t finally\t called\t MMS,\t became known in many countries and about 5 million people have now used it. And that is good, but not good enough. Something was missing – a vehicle to protect MMS and its users, and to introduce MMS to Earth without immediately alarming the opposition. At that time, it was clear that without some kind of an organization, we wouldn’t have a chance once the government began to attack. I began to read about churches and sovereignty and what it takes to"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"241 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing avoid a government and also what can be done to stand up against a government. Actually law is a weapon that governments have used against the people for thousands of years and religion has been used for even longer than law. But both law and religion can also be used FOR the people if one has the right knowledge. Years earlier, I had discovered a small church that has come down through time to the present day from the days of Antioch when Jesus said, among other things, “Go ye into all the world and heal the sick.” I was already a Minister and I speeded up the process through Deacon and Priest, and because of my studies and my work around the world I was consecrated into the lineage of Bishops that leads all the way back to Jesus Christ. Therefore, if you didn’t know, I am a Bishop and have the legal right to create a Church. Well, I guess anyone can create a Church, but when you are in the lineage of Bishops, your authority for creating churches is considered to come directly from Jesus Christ. It would be very hard for any authority, religious or governmental, to disallow my authority to create a church. That’s what I wanted. When the time comes that they try to disallow the Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing, they won’t be able to get beyond our proof that we are authentic. Our papers and proof are just as authentic as the Catholic Church’s papers. We may not have the backing that the Catholic Church has, but it would be unwise of the Catholics, or any other church, to not back us, as that would tend to invalidate them as well. About Creating Churches Certain steps must be followed in creating churches: Step #1: At least 6 people must come together and draw up a set of agreements normally called Articles of Association. Step #2: These agreements are written down and at least 6 people sign them. They usually sign a set of Articles of Faith, and other articles of commitment. Step #3: The Bishop forming the Church also signs the documents. Step #4: These Articles are then posted where they may be seen by\t those\t interested,\t such\t as\t government\t officials\t and\t other\t public\t and private individuals. The Articles of Association for Genesis"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"242 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing 2 Church of Health and Healing (that’s us) are posted on the internet at www.genesis2church.org . They were posted a couple of months before the FDA trouble started, so they cannot accuse us of forming a church to get around pre-existing problems. You may ask, “But when are you going to register your church or your Articles of Association?” And that’s exactly what the IRS will ask us. If we do not register it, the IRS will drop by and explain that we must\t be\t a\t 501(c)(3)\t nonprofit\t corporation.\t They\t will\t probably\t even\t offer to help us, and explain that we will not be tax-exempt until we sign the 501 papers. •\t But that is not true, and signing 501 papers would be our biggest mistake in becoming a church. It would indicate agreement to all the 501(c)(3) rules of the government, thousands of rules. If we don’t sign, then they will explain that we must at least become a\t nonprofit\t corporation,\t as\t that\t is\t the\t minimum\t IRS\t requirement\t for\t us to be tax-exempt. They may even bring papers with them to make it easy for us. If that doesn’t work, a government agent will come by and tell us with complete certainty that we must at least register our church with one of the Church registers set up by the government so that they will know to recognize that we are a church and not bother us. So you see, we are a church that does not make contracts with governments. When one of our ministers decides to start a Chapter of our Church, all he need do is advertise in the local paper that the Genesis 2 Church now has a local chapter and has come to heal people free of charge. Like any other church, our Church depends on donations. We heal for free and expect the church member to donate only when he or she has become well or is at least feeling much better and the suffering is gone. Genesis II Church Goals So let me point out that this church was not formed to worship God but rather to heal the sick. The only beliefs that any member is required to have are in: •\t Doing Good Deeds; •\t Healing the Sick; and •\t Always Doing What is Right."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"243 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing Worshiping God and other religious rituals are for other churches. Our job is to go forth and obey the command of Jesus, “HEAL THE SICK.” Although we have other beliefs, we do not ask members of our church to have beliefs other than in doing good deeds, healing the sick, and always doing what is right. We expect that you will want to attend some other church for your spiritual beliefs. You might feel that healing the sick is the only spiritual belief you need, or if not, you might want to look closer at the spiritual beliefs of our church, the Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing. Please read on. Aside from healing, our church will maintain a special fund for protecting our members from various dangers including vaccination. The fund will pay to hire lawyers, when it is necessary, to legally prevent vaccination of our members. As the protection fund grows in size, the Church will be able to pick out agencies and other entities that are doing things against the U.S. Constitution or against mankind in other countries, and begin bringing class action suits to stop these atrocities. We have decided to do the best we can to take action against those who seek to destroy us. I’d like to point out that almost no one else is currently taking such action. Hundreds of people are reporting the atrocities, but reporting has gone on for many dozens of years and nothing else has been done. It is now time to do something. Below are the main covenants and beliefs of the Genesis 2 Church. There are other beliefs and we have constructed them into a legal document which you can see by visiting our website www.gene- sis2church.org . I hope you can see that these beliefs are all simple logic. Special Covenants of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing Number 1: Concerning the Sanctity of Human Blood We believe in the sanctity of human blood as God created it, and we believe that man must not violate this sanctity by penetrating the skin or any of the body’s blood vessels with any of the vaccines created by man, as they all contain poisons. We believe that God does not want his children to use the vaccines in any way or to violate their blood with them. The fact is that no-one has proven that vaccines reduce disease on Earth. Thus we will"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"244 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing always resist the vaccinations of man or the attempt of man to alter human blood in any way. Bible references: (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:11, 17:14; Deuteronomy 12:23) Vaccination References: www.relfe.com/history2.html and, www.trufax.org . Number 2: Concerning the Purchasing of Health Insurance We believe that to purchase insurance against being sick is an insult to God in that you are saying to your God, “I do not believe that you will protect me from sickness, and therefore I must buy insurance against bad health”. We must not purchase health insurance, as it insults God. Number 3: Concerning the Sanctity of Food, Both Animal and Plant Throughout the world, the alteration of plants by gene splicing and DNA alteration has already caused much suffering. Thousands of farmers in India have committed suicide over the failure of altered crop plants when, at the same time, they are restricted from using their traditional heirloom seeds. The food plants of mankind have always been adequate without man’s interference in the nature of plants as God made them. Obviously God did not mean for his plants to be altered and we believe that companies that genetically modify plants and animals are one of the greatest insults to God that mankind has devised. Although the transportation and delivery of food has always been a problem, there has always been enough food to feed all of mankind. Alteration of our food has not proven to be useful or successful. Number 4: Concerning Agreements With Governments We believe that God does not want any of his churches to sign agreements with governments or governmental agencies or other agencies that act as governmental agencies, or with corpora - tions that have agreements with governments or their agencies. It should be obvious. The most powerful of all beings does not have to make agreements restricting his power, as nothing can restrict his power."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"245 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing Special Beliefs of the Genesis II Church Number 1: We of the Genesis 2 Church believe that all people have the right to physical health; Number 2: We believe that all people have the right to determine their own methods of attaining physical health; Number 3: We believe that all people have the right to consume various products for their health including but not limited to vitamins, minerals, herbs, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and all other substances, in any quantities they consider will be useful or helpful for their personal health; Number 4: We believe that all people have the right to purchase these products for their health and to maintain such products in their homes; Number 5: We believe that all people have the right to use any electrical, electromechanical, or mechanical machines that they believe may be useful to improve their health and wellbeing; Number 6: We believe that all people have the right to live dis- ease-free lives; Number 7: We believe that all people have the right to determine the use or non-use of any and all drugs or chemicals or other substances that could be injected into their bodies, or could be suggested, ordered, or prescribed for their use by ingestion, injection or any other method of administering them; Number 8: We believe that all humans inherently know God’s will at all times if they just trust themselves to know it. We believe that it is God’s will that all humans should always do what is right. We believe that each man or woman inherently knows what is right, or can determine for himself or herself what is right, and no-one needs a preacher or any particular book to tell him or her what is right. It is each person’s responsibility to determine the correct path to follow and to evaluate carefully all information offered by humans. Nobody is obliged to accept information just because mortal men claim the information is from God or from God’s books, or from scientists, or other authorities of any and all kinds. Each person has the right to evaluate the information for himself or herself. At www.genesis2church.org , Genesis 2 Church authorities have"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"246 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing written down all those things that make it a church. These are the beliefs of those of us who formed the church; however, the Church does not require all members to subscribe to those beliefs. We only require our members to believe in: •\t Doing good deeds; •\t Healing the sick; and •\t Always doing what is right. The Church will do everything in its power to protect its members from government attempts to force vaccination on them, and the church will eventually maintain legal health food distribution centers or other sales mechanisms to help people continue to obtain the foods that they believe they need for their health. Once a Minister, What Can You Do? The Genesis II Church now maintains a training center in the Dominican Republic and so far has trained students from more than 40 countries throughout the world. •\t The\tstudents\tall\treceive\tMinister\tof\tHealth\tCertificates. •\t Those who have successfully treated (healed) 20 people or more\treceive\ta\tDoctor\tof\tMMS\tCertificate. The\t Doctor\t of\t MMS\t Certificate\t is\t based\t on\t successfully\t treating\t people and is awarded by Bishop Jim Humble on a case by case basis. Any Minister of Health or Doctor of MMS may open a local Chapter of the Genesis II Church. They may do this in their home or in any other local place of meeting. They may put a notice in the local paper indicating that the Genesis II Church chapter is present and ready to begin healing, at no charge, to those who are sick. At this time, people are coming from around the world to be trained in the use of MMS, which we now call Cleansing Water. They then return to their homes to open a Chapter of the Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing. They announce in the local paper that our Church is now present and ready to begin healing people at no cost. They can also begin to visit people in their neighborhood, explaining the mission of the Genesis II Church. They can search out those who are sick and offer to help them with our cleansing water and our Sacrament. Our sacraments are similar to the sacraments in any"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"247 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing church.\t They\t are\t the\t specific\t rituals\t of\t the\t church\t and\t in\t our\t case\t they correspond to the MMS protocols. People to be healed are asked to become church members, although that is not a requirement. However, they are asked to sign a paper explaining that we ask for a donation only after they are well, and that the donation is strictly voluntary. Each\t Church \tmember\t who\t has\t been\t trained\t receives\t an\t identifica - tion\t card\t and\t a\t certificate\t to\t hang\t on\t the\t wall\t showing\t his\t church\t level. The logo is very beautiful, depicting a New Earth free of disease, and is suitable for putting up as a sign anywhere to show the presence of the Church. The various employees of our Church will have job names based on the jobs in the church that they perform. We require that most jobs be held by people who understand MMS (our cleansing water and our sacraments). Ministers may open Chapters of the Church around the world. There will also be Deacons, Priests, Doctors of MMS, and Bishops. Genesis 2 Church and the Law Our\t church\t has\t no\t intention\t of\t opposing\t or\t fighting\t the\t law,\t but\t we must know the law and maintain our legal status. Throughout the ages, the church usually had power over the governments. They maintained their power mostly through fear. The fear usually revolved in one way or another around the idea that one would lose his eternity, that his actions would damn him forever. In the last century, the governments began to get more power as the churches were losing theirs. The reason that this happened is not a part of this discussion; but the fact that it did happen is important. Out of this new condition developed the theory of separation of church and state. This new theory of separation included the legal philosophy of equal powers of Church and State. •\t The church does not tell the government how to run the government and the government does not tell the church how to run the church. And that philosophy still exists today. But governments throughout the world have learned to usurp the powers of each church as it is formed. Or they have learned to create laws that give them what they think is power over the churches. And the fact is that their laws usually work even though they are not really legal,\tand\tdefinitely\tare\tnot\tlawful.\t"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"248 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing The laws are generally constructed so that they negate the power of the Church by obtaining the signature of the leaders in some sort of manipulation. The government agrees to do something for the Church and in return, the Church agrees to operate under the laws and regulations of the government. Most churches don’t even realize they are signing over their sovereignty to the Government. But when they sign, they become subject to hundreds of rules, if not thousands. \t The Catholic church and the Mormon church are the only large churches that have not signed away all their rights. An example in the United States is that the Constitution of the U.S. states that Congress shall make no laws respecting the es- tablishment of religion or regulating religion. That means no laws . Basically, that philosophy exists in all countries to some extent or the other. In countries that were at one time colonized by England, that philosophy exists in common law. Although the governments try to make laws overcoming the common law it isn’t easy, as the courts continue to respect and uphold common law. That’s why the government must in some way get the signature of a church leader on their contract so the courts must uphold the contract rather than the common law. Although in the U.S., Congress cannot make laws regulating Churches, the various governmental agencies, such as the IRS, can and do establish contracts with churches. When a new church is formed, the IRS shows up and says, “If you become\t a\t non-profit\t 501(c)3\t corporation,\t you\t won’t\t have\t to\t pay\t taxes.” Since most of these churches do not realize that Congress can make no laws requiring churches to pay taxes, they immediately sign to become a 501(c)3 corporation. They don’t realize that there are no laws requiring them to pay taxes and the IRS will go so far as to threaten them if they don’t sign up. IRS Control Over 501(c)(3) Churches Let me show you some of the rules these churches come under when they sign up. Remember, you come under these rules only if\t you\t sign\t up\t to\t be\t non-profit\t with\t the\t IRS\t because\t Congress\t can\t make no laws regulating churches. This is a summary of IRS rules. They are not conveniently listed in any central location -- the IRS has them scattered in numerous documents assembled under different regulations."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"249 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing Source: Pastor Greg Dixon of the Indianapolis Baptist Temple , a church whose property was seized right after the 2000 election on the orders of the outgoing Clinton administration. #1: Church must have a distinct legal existence -- it must be incorporated. #2: It must have a recognized (approved) creed or form of worship. #3: It must have a distinct form of ecclesiastical government (e.g., General Conference, board of governors/trustees, etc., and state/local organizations, etc.) #4: It\tmust\thave\ta\tspecific\tcode\tof\tdoctrine\tand\tdiscipline.

(The IRS determines which methods are acceptable for raising funds.) #18: Must answer to the IRS for any sermon or organizational position which is critical of the IRS.

(This has to do with the promulgation of state marriage licenses. Marriage historically existed as an ecclesias - tical\t certification,\t and\t is\t supposed\t to\t be\t protected\t by\t the\t free\t exercise clause of the 1st Amendment. Anything that involved in- termarriage was, in the early days of the US, subject to licensure on the grounds that slaves could do nothing without permission. This was the back door which the government has used to promote the licensure of all marriages. The church has become an accomplice in causing married couples to have a third party in their union without their knowledge or consent. All forms of licensed activity may be regulated by the state, including the “fruits of marriage” – your children. This is how state child welfare agents get away with “legally” violating people’s 4th Amendment rights!) #21: Pastor cannot enter the public debate about the licensure of ministries. (Ministers must be licensed by the state in which they intend to practice, unless ordained denominationally, in which case the pastor may preach anywhere the denomination has an established presence.)

(Compare the apostle who said, “We should obey the laws of God above the laws of men”.) #30: Pastor cannot publicly criticize the actions of the government in the implementation of public policy (e.g., promoting sex education, etc.) Our Ministers of Health must realize that we must not sign up with the government in any way. God does not need permission from governments to exist or to have his Churches in the land.

The government would stop us. We would have given them the power to tell us to stop using our Cleansing Water. In the beginning, before we have the money to oppose them, we may have to sometimes sign their registration forms but that should not be done if we can prevent it. If at all possible, we should just start each Church chapter and begin healing people. If we can get a few people healed before the government really starts pushing, that will be\t a\t definite\t help\t when\t we\t go\t to\t court.\t It\t will\t also\t help\t to\t keep\t the\t government from bothering us. Eventually, as soon as the Church can afford it, we will provide any of our Ministers with lawyers that will invoke common law or other past laws to prevent us from signing any government papers at all.

Training in the Dominican Republic This\t is\t where\t you\t come\t for\t training\t in\t MMS.\t But\t first\t let\t me\t tell\t you\t the story. I left Malawi after being threatened with 5 years of prison, although that wasn’t the reason for leaving Malawi. I left there to come\t here\t to\t train\t the\t first\t class\t ever\t in\t MMS.\t We\t had\t agreed\t by\t email to do this. I traveled straight to the Dominican Republic. There I met Mark Grenon and his two sons Joe and John. Earlier, Mark had sent me a letter saying that he wanted to sell his compound and come work with me. They had been in this location in the DR for 12 years helping the local people and even bringing doctors from America to treat people here. They had created a large compound with a building to house at least 50 people. Its purpose was to accommodate the doctors who came as well as the local people who needed treatment. This was to be our place for training people on all the details of MMS. I had already started forming the Genesis 2 Church before I arrived, but I had not said much about it. When I arrived here, I began telling people\t and\t at\t first\t there\t were\t some\t who\t were\t dubious\t about\t it\t but\t not many. As time went by, those people changed their minds."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"253 Genesis II Church of Healthand Healing About Our Dominican Facilities I\t wanted\t a\t place\t out\t of\t the\t major\t lines\t of\t world\t traffic\t and\t I\t preferred\t a place in the third world. I wanted a place different than, and more spiritually\t oriented\t than,\t first\t world\t countries.\t Generally\t speaking,\t I\t wanted people who can confront third world conditions, but a place for them that was safer than typical third world neighborhoods. And that’s what I got. The people here are all our friends. We furnish them with water from our very good well and some of them work for us and some are related to Mark’s son. The 15-foot wall around our complex is cement and the gates are always kept locked, though it is not necessary. That is just our way. We are safer than we would be in New York City. The\t only\t problem\t I\t had\t was\t from\t my\t two\t secretaries.\t My\t first\t secretary went with me to Germany and upon arrival back here, she decided\twe\t must\t leave\t here\t and\t always\t go\t to\t a\t first\t class\t hotel\t in\t a\t large city so as to be professional. She insisted that we not do the MMS courses here. Well I’m supposed to be running things to some extent although I take suggestions from everyone, but this wasn’t a suggestion\t from\t my\t secretary,\t it\t was\t an\t order.\t Either\t we\t go\t to\t a\t first\t class hotel or she would quit. Well, she quit. I only hire secretaries who are totally interested in helping with the MMS movement. My second secretary started with the same idea: that\t we\t must\t take\t the\t MMS\t seminars\t to\t a\t first\t class\t hotel.\t She\t said\t it was her job to make us professional. Neither secretary was willing to consider the spirituality of it all. They just believed we needed a fancy hotel to make us professional. So the second one wound up having to leave as well. I actually needed someone to help me, not run the operation. Everybody else was with me. Just my secretaries were trying to run things. However, the third secretary turned out to be very good. In our Dominican compound, we are apart, out of the cross roads of the\t world.\t It\t is\t a\t third\t world\t complex\t with\t many\t first\t world\t facilities\t and is perfect for our purpose. People can be trained here and have some experience interacting with and treating third world people. By the time our students return to civilization, I want them to have had some of this experience, sort of like I’ve had. It is a perfectly safe area. Of course, not everyone will be able to get this kind of training.

We try to have a seminar every month or so. So far we have more than 49 countries represented with more than 178 Ministers of Health trained and we have only been at it for 11 months. But we are growing extremely fast. If you come here, we have set it so that the seminar can be taught by people other than myself, which takes some of the strain off of me. However, I try to teach the seminar when I can and when I am here. But my DVD helps, as whoever is teaching can just play the DVD for 15 minutes and then turn it off to discuss what I said. So no matter who is teaching the seminar, you get a full seminar from me in\t addition\t to\t everyone\t discussing\t what\t I\t talk\t about.\t On\t the\t final\t day,\t everyone takes a test, and we then go over all the questions to make sure everyone understood each question and answer. In\t this\t way,\t everyone\t hears\t every\t concept\t three\t or\t four\t or\t five\t times,\t but in a different way each time, thus making it easier to absorb the data. Everyone has said that they prefer this method of teaching and it does go smoothly. Each person gets the complete set of 8 DVDs, giving the complete course with me teaching the whole course. And most important, everyone learns to teach the course themselves using my DVDs. In addition to the above, I have also decided that each person must implement each part of the curriculum. This helps everyone to remember the details more clearly and for longer.

The cost will vary with what is happening but normally it is $1500 for one and a half weeks of intense training and experience treating the local people. You can go to www.jimhumble.biz and use the link to a website giving current costs. But if you cannot come, you can still purchase the DVD complete seminar by me, Jim Humble, and we will furnish you with a 200-question test that you must pass. If necessary, we will help you pass it. You will receive a Minister of Health\t certificate,\t an\t Authorization\t to\t open\t a\t Chapter\t of\t the\t Church\t Certificate,\t a\t Membership\t certificate,\t and\t suggested\t advertisement\t text for your local newspaper.

There are none of the distrac- tions\t you\t would\t find\t in\t a\t major\t first\t class\t hotel.\t We\t are\t all\t here\t for\t the same purpose. Let me mention one sort of secret. Most of the people have told me that they believe in MMS, but that wasn’t the major reason they came here. They didn’t know the major reason. They felt urged to come. Many said that they had to come. So if you have to come, then come and learn why that is so, as you will also find\tthat\tthis\tis\ta\tspiritual\texperience.

A million years passed without change; There was no-one to consider it strange That a planet nearest the Sun In History would never be outdone--- Earth’s story would be long-range. Thousands of gods, you see Knew that man needs to be free; The lone planet was moved To be the third planet and approved And was set in eternity. The gods’ agreement had much worth: Meet at the third millennium on earth. Now they have come to help man To overcome evil as they can--- It has been our job since birth. Finally, the sands of time Bring a mission sublime: The samds proclaim a time to come When men shall have their freedom Our Church heralds the beginning chime. The story of the past In memory does not last; It isnot for men to see--- It would not help them be, To know what was cast. Each man returns in short a space To have a game and take his place; To love and live again And work with other men And be with the human race. Each time he does not see He is cast in eternity--- The times before Are now no more And can no longer be. It is best to know As through time we go That we are here And that is clear; It’s for us to grow. The past is gone Like the night at dawn; It does not exist And should not be missed--- Dro not carry it on.

Humble #####"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"259 MMS and Drugs MMS and Drugs I have, from time to time, been accused of treating diseases without a license. Some doctors have climbed on their high horses and said that I have been putting lives at risk. I have always answered that they have one hell of a nerve being critical of me for simply distributing a mineral solution, which is not a drug. Any medical doctor is to some extent a part of the medical system and they either approve of Big Pharma or they go along with them. Each year, more than 975,000 people die in the U.S. as a result of medical drugs. More people die each year from the use of medical drugs than from any other cause of death. That’s 975,000 deaths each year that should not have occurred. I doubt that there is a single medical doctor in the US or any other country of the world that has not had people die while being treated with drugs he prescribed. Well, I have treated more people than most doctors and I have never had anyone die while being treated with MMS. In fact, so far there has not been a single death reported. The single death in Australia has never been proven to have been caused by MMS. Critics of MMS like to cite it all the time, while thinking it’s OK for over 1.5 million deaths to happen from various drugs prescribed by doctors. That woman’s husband states she took two drops of MMS. I have given a mouse 2 drops of MMS with no problems to the mouse noted. Please see p. 178 for information about the report written by Judith R. Lubbers in 1982 concerning dozens of volunteers who took chlorine dioxide daily for 12 weeks with increasing amounts to many times 2 drops. Of 5 million people who have tried MMS, there has never been a single death reported that happened while a person was actively taking MMS. (As explained in the Foreword, this book was written in stages and thus different numbers of MMS users have been given, as more than two years have passed from one report to the next.) When I talk about deaths due to medical drugs, I am talking about incidents in which people died because they: •\t Were given the wrong drug in a hospital or a clinic; •\t Were given a drug overdose; •\t Had an adverse drug reaction (ADR); •\t Had a drug taken away too quickly; or"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"260 MMS and Drugs •\t Died from a drug’s side effects. Fatal Condition 10 Year Deaths Adverse drug reaction 1.06 million Medical errors 0.98 million Bedsores 1.15 million Nosocomial infections 0.88 million Outpatients 1.99 million Unnecessary procedures 371,360 Surgical errors 320,000 Total 6,751,360 Deaths Why do you think that when they advertise a drug on TV they are required to mention the drug’s side effects? One thing they usually say is that “serious or fatal reactions have occurred.” Most people have been to a medical doctor many times, or at least once or twice. Can you remember? The doctor sits down to write a prescription and he says to you, “We’ll try this drug. It’s supposed to be very effective. If it doesn’t work, come back and we’ll try something else.” What’s he doing? He is experimenting to see what works. If you happen to die after taking the drug, no one thinks a thing about it. It isn’t even questioned. During the past ten years of the MMS initiative, the medical system generated 6.7 million U.S. deaths independent of any disease. That is more deaths than have been caused by all the wars fought in U.S. history. The majority of drug deaths could have been prevented. Yet this continues year after year while the government oversight agency (the FDA) spends millions working to ban a health food item or an herb that might have been associated with one death. Drugs make money for the drug companies and for doctors. The medical estab- lishment feels that it must attack any item that might take the place of a drug and reduce their income. Herbs heal and not even one death per year is reported connected with taking herbs. Does anyone see the ridiculous difference in death statistics? Of course, the FDA claims that anything used to treat a disease is a drug, and therefore must have all the associated testing, which costs up to 100 million dollars. But just because the FDA makes this claim doesn’t\t mean\t every\t remedy\t is\t a\t drug.\t I\t would\t dispute\t their\t definition\t"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"261 MMS and Drugs of\t a\t drug,\t as\t opposed\t to\t fighting\t about\t their\t claim\t that\t MMS\t must\t undergo millions of dollars of testing. Who gives them the right to change\t the\t definition\t of\t things\t so\t that\t they\t can\t then\t smear\t a\t healthy\t herb because it competes successfully with a drug that has killed, for example, 100 people or more? The National Center for Health Statistics in its Death/Mortality section provides statistics on the causes of death each year and currently reports that in 2007: •\t 616,067individuals died of heart disease each year and •\t 562,875died of cancer . They mention 8 more categories of “leading causes of death” but do not mention a single death caused by medical drugs and their research statistics show none. When a person with cancer dies from being given the wrong drug, the government reports it as a cancer death. However, the actual cause of death is also shown in the report if you care to dig it out. The drug death is included in the report, but not in the government’s statistics. Gary Null, PhD, who performed much of the research for the report, “ Death by Medicine ,” was able to dig out the true statistics, because the data is available and cannot be suppressed. People in the U.S. are spending billions of dollars on medical treatments and could have the best medical treatment on the planet, but they have not even come close to achieving it. And still there are doctors who are so scared they will lose revenue that they feel they must attack MMS. But we are not talking about a drug, so why attack it or me? Why not take a day or two and check it out? Try it. See if it works. It’s simple. Does it work or doesn’t it? Don’t take my word, or someone else’s word; try it yourself. As I mentioned previously, the entire country of Haiti would now be malaria-free if medical doctors had not put a stop to our work there. Curing Diseases With Drugs? Can diseases be cured with drugs? No. The only things that ever heal the body are the body’s own mechanisms. Healing is controlled by the body. NO drug or nutrient can heal the body -- NOT ONE! There are things that the body can use to aid in healing, but in the final\t analysis,\t the\t body\t always\t does\t the\t healing.\t Drugs occasionally help the process, but all drugs are poisons to a greater or lesser"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"262 MMS and Drugs extent. Normally, the body needs nutrients rather than poisons . MMS cannot heal or cure the body of any health problem. It may or may not kill pathogens in the body without the body’s control. However, once the germs, pathogens , or poisons are destroyed, healing can take place at a much faster rate. This is why healing in so many parts of the body seems to happen so much faster. It is not that the MMS has healed anything—it cannot—but it can clear the way for healing to take place. #####"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"263     Afterwords Afterwords Please Become a Hero and Put Your Story on the Internet I f you have been healed by MMS, please put your story somewhere on the internet. We need thousands of stories out there. Mankind needs thousands of stories on the internet. I am sorry to be so dramatic, but someone needs to be dramatic. MMS will, for the most part, heal the diseases of mankind, with a few exceptions, but the Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing has most of the exceptions already worked out. Aztec clay , oil of oregano , diatomaceous earth, and magnets are already being used to overcome the exceptions that MMS does not handle. The magnetics are for healing bones . I guarantee that if you put your story on the internet about your healing through MMS or the Genesis 2 Church, you will save at least one life and may be a part of saving thousands of lives. That is, your story will click with at least one person of all the thousands who will read it and that person will decide to try MMS (could be thousands of persons). Even better, they may decide to come to a Minister of Health seminar of our Church and get expert advice and help and direct training in using our Cleansing Water (MMS).

Make sure it is made from sodium chlorite . Normally, stabilized oxygen is one eighth the strength of MMS, so when the instructions in this book call for starting with 2 drops of MMS, you will need 16 drops of stabilized oxygen. Don’t forget the lemon, lime, citric acid, or vinegar activator . To treat any kind of a condition, you will need to reach 120 drops a day, so a bottle won’t last very long, as most contain one ounce or less. For maintenance and to keep your immune system up and in good shape, you will need at least 48 drops a day. You can also buy MMS from one of the suppliers on the Web. A 4-ounce bottle that costs $20 will last you a year. It will last you 2 years if you use a 6-drop maintenance dose twice a week. Better still, buy the sodium chlorite and make your own MMS.

The specific strain is southern European and must go back to the middle 1970s. Available treatments had no effect and my medical records from the 1980s show liver enlargement, then a pre-cirrhosis state and a steady downward curve. However, after four weeks of taking MMS and a follow-up of ten days, I’m certain that nothing is left of the Hepatitis C. My previously rather yellow eyes have cleared up completely, pain in the liver area is gone, and I do enjoy some wine and beer without any consequences.
